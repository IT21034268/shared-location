5,No problems with this one,"Have had no problems so far. It has clear picture, no distortion, good colors. Feels so much better than my old CRT!I'm never going to own another CRT again."
5,one of greatest industrial albums ever!,"Mentallo & the Fixer are quite possibly one of the most innovative and talented bands in the industrial genre of the 90's. ""Where Angels Fear to Tread"" is their best album to date. Their songs are spiritual, emotional, and hauntingly beautiful. They provide some of the most complicated and intricate musicianship in the electronic genre. Anybody who is anybody recognizes this band as one of the best. If you prefere intellectual and emotional music, you will love this CD. You don't have to be a ""rivethead "" or a ""goth"" to enjoy this masterpiece, but if you like superficial and bland music, do not buy this CD. This CD is for adventerous music listeners with an open mind and it is not for the faint of heart. Gary and Dwayne Dassing are some of the best composers around."
5,pleased,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this album. A few years ago, I heard Burnt Beyond Recognition, and did not enjoy it, even after many listens. But, Where Angels Fear to Tread is FANTASTIC. It is a rich and varied collection of music, some of it immediately and obviously beautiful (e.g., ""Battered States of Euphoria""), some of it thunderously violent (e.g., the awesome ""Bring to a Boil""). It is very melodic, but at the same time has heavy beats and complex noise arrangements. The recording is not as crisp as modern pop music, but that is not a significant problem. One song, Atom Smasher, is ruined by movie sample overuse. But, the bottom line is that this is excellent music, well worth owning."
1,Don't buy this junk...,"Windows XP Pro, Razr V3... I did manage to get this to work once for a short period of time; not enough time for me to get the software to do anything. Software doesn't recognize the phone connection most of the time, plug/unplug (more time than I'd ever admit) the USB. I've tried it on 3 systems, each fails about the same way. Tried the upgrade for the Razr, it didn't get any better; in fact it may have been worse. If you have not purchased this product yet- DON'T. If you have it and it doesn't work and you think you can fiddle with it to make it work - forget it; my suggestion to immediately break the CD with a hammer and then break the USB connector. The end result wil be the same and you'll not waste any more time screwing around with this piece of junk."
1,Did not work,I try to install this for more than one week and I couln'deven call desk help they did not help me at all.don't buy this product.
5,Must Have,I love this software especially since I can make my own ringtones of whatever mp3 I want instead of paying $2.50 per ringtone from my cell phone company.
2,Not for the V220 phonebook,"If you take lots of pictures and want to download them, this software works fine. But there is no phonebook manager for the Motorola V220."
1,"I'd give negative stars, but that wasn't an option",I can't get it to install and I'm not new to computing. don't waste your money.
2,"Not great, but it does what I need it to do","Installation on Windows XP laptop was very troublesome, with constant requests to restart the PC. After finding some info on Mobile Action website, was able to install successfully.I wanted to do two things: to be able to get pictures out of my Razr and be able to upload ringtunes. This software and data cable was able to do this reliably once everything was installed. Oddly enough, the File Manager function will not allow you to delete any files from the phone, even though the help menu shows how to do it. We have two Razr's and it would be nice if it could recognize which one was which.Not the best written software but it does what I need it to do and the price was reasonable. FYI- The Motorola software cost more and is totally useless, so do not consider that as an alternative."
1,"Disappointing software, non-standard USB data cable","Software is very limited/limiting and doesn't work very well. At all. I only really wanted this in order to type in phone contacts from my last phone rather than do it all on the phone itself, but, frankly, it's not even really up to that task, much less anything more demanding - like synchronising.The USB cable has a big fat dongle on it and is a device in it's own right - so cannot be used with other drivers/software that ""talks"" to a V3 (or other Motorola phones with the same data interface) directly. Extremely disappointed with this purchase.My advice would be to buy a standard USB->5 pin mini-USB cable anywhere for $5-$10 and use freely-available drivers and software for wallpaper/ringtones/volume gain/skins/pictures uploading/downloading instead.It only gets one star because there's not a selection for ""zero"". I'd like my money back because it's not fit for the purpose for which it was intended, but fat chance of that."
1,beware v3c owners,Although they indicate it will work with the Verizon V3C it doesn't...It isn't compatible with the latest software build and I can' get any response from Mobile Action. I'm going to find a company that's responsive and lives up to their advertised claims.
3,Love and danger in the Far East,"In case you couldn't figure it out, the kingdom of slender swords is the poetic name for Japan. But don't expect too many Japanese characters in a story set in Japan. I mean, where's the sense of that? We want to read about Westerners and the long and bumpy road to romance. We want to read about Westerners plotting an act of atomic terrorism on Japanese soil (like that would ever happen) and whether they'll succeed or not. We don't want to read about Japanese people in Japan."
3,Just some business details and too much sailing and private things.,Just some business details and too much sailing and private things.
1,MORE HYPE THAN SUBSTANCE,"This book was an insult to my intelligence. Instead of an objective biography, it comes across as a paid P.R piece written by a Ted Turner sycophant. Don't waste your money on this trash. Too bad there isn't a ""zero stars"" rating!!!"
2,Nice product but...,Product arrived without the washer and stem for pulling up the soap. Still waiting for the backordered parts from Danze. I've been waiting 3 weeks so far. It wouldn't be so bad except I ordered the Danze stainless kitchen faucet previouly through Amazon and received the chrome version. Doesn't match the kitchen but in an effort to be a team player I decided to keep it and convert the other accessories to chrome. Now this!
1,Not all Solid Brass at all,"I ordered this particular soap dispenser because it was reported to be all brass. Well, I received it and guess what??? Not all brass at all...the threaded stem which accepts the plastic bottle is....you guessed it...plastic. This part appears to be brass in both pictures. The solid brass construction is the reason I ordered this product rather than a cheaper one. Let's hope that the pump actually works...and is ""solid brass"". So, folks, this product isn't the high quality is proported to be. If you wish to buy one, you might want to look at the less expensive product and then decide."
2,missing part,"You'd think someone would have done something about the missing parts by now. Well, that's what I thought so I bought it despite the warnings. It arrived without the washer. Silly me."
3,OK Product,Worked ok but I had two concerns - the washer mentioned in the instructions was not included in the package and the size of the hole cover was fairly small so it had to be positioned correctly or it did not cover all of a standard hole.
3,"Nice dispenser, looks great on the sink",It looks great on the sink and works well with thinner soaps. I believe it needs a stronger return spring. Cold days and thick soap makes it VERY slow to pump.
2,Bait & Switch,"The product arrived missing the washer mentioned in the instructions. To make matters worse, it was also made of cheap white plastic inside and not ""Solid Brass Construction"" as advertised. I contacted the manufacturer and they did not have a washer by itself to send out. So I had to make a trip to the local home improvement store to buy the missing part. After installation, the pump works and looks clean, but unhappy about inferior construction and missing part."
4,still hawppy with it,"I purchased this item over a year ago and it works today just as well as it did the day I put it in. It is nothing fancy to look at, but it's very easy to fill and use.It can feel a bit wobbly when you press down on it for the soap squirt, but nothing that causes any functional problem. Soap comes out fine, and doesn't spray out all over the place. I would recommend this to a friend, and get another one if this one wears out. I love having it."
1,"Misleading, not same product shown","While I liked the product described here, you can see the picture shows a copper ring that obviously would be below visible service of your deck and the bottle below your deck.However, there is a cheaper, white plastic ring in it's place that has a slightly wider top than would fit in the hole I premeasured for this device.Meaning, it just won't install and is headed back."
3,Works fine but could have larger flange.,"The dispenser works as intended and looks good. Installation was a little trickier than necessary because of the small flange which just barely covered the holes in my sink. Move the dispenser a mm, and the hole is exposed."
4,Good quality...small bottle,"Overall we are happy with this dispenser. We have 2 others in the house but this is our first Danze. The only issue I had was that the bottle was too small for my liking. I prefer to not have to refill the bottle too often and since this dispenser is at our kitchen sink, it gets used the most. We just switched the bottles with another dispenser in the house and it fit great. It looks nice with our new granite countertops and stainless steel faucet. We liked the look because it was pretty simple. I would recommend this product!"
1,Didn't last,I've had this for 11 months now and the pump stopped working. The pump parts are the typical plastic which seem to be generic to most all of these pumps regardless of brand. I suspect they are all made in China and then branded with various company names. I'm contacting Danze and see if they will honor their lifetime warranty.
4,Will Eisner Ghosts what's not to like,"This is a nice little book, by Will Eisner. It is a different cover than what is pictured here, though. I had hoped that it would be the same size as the other Eisner graphic novels that I have been buying, but once I got into reading it, everything was just fine. It is a marvelous read, and a handy size to put in my pocket to read at work."
3,SACRED GEOMETRY,WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO TELL US THIS WILL STRECH YOUR MIND METAPHYSHICS AT ITS BEST SO MUCH MORE TO OUR WORLD THAN WHAT WE ARE TAUGHT KEEP SEARCHING
2,Dissapointed,"As a huge DMB fan and a string player (cellist) myself, I was expecting more from this recording. It lacks energy, big time. Many of the songs feel under tempo and sloppily put together. The arrangements are great, it just doesn't seem to flow from there. Maybe I'll learn to love it, but right now after a few initial plays, it just doesn't sit well with me."
3,The Dave Matthews Band deserves a better tribute,"While the tracks on this CD remain true to their inspirations and are very nice, the overall quality is lacking. The London Contemporary String Ensemble sounds much more impressive until you actually listen to the CD. I would recommend this CD to any big Dave fan - just take advantage of the ability to buy it used or discounted."
2,A disappointing sequel,"I had so much hope for this book after reading the Carr's first book The Alienist. This book however lacked all the elements that made the first on so good. Missing was the in depth psychological profiling, the search for the villian and the anticipation of the climax. This book also did not develop the characters from the first book any further and I did not remember the character of John being as stupid in the first book as he was made out to be in this one. If your looking for a fairly interesting tale with some good description of turn of the century New York this would be a good read. If you loved the first book and are looking a good sequel then pass this one by."
2,Disapointing,"I read and loved the Alienist and hoped for more of the same in Angel of Darkness. Angel did not come close to measuring up and I was very disappointed. I did not like Stevie as the narrator and would have preferred the character Moore's adult perspective instead. Stevie's use of ""what"" instead of ""that"" nearly drove me crazy. Also, Moore, a character I liked in the Alienist, was turned into a foolish, ignorant character who was almost entirely useless except for Carr's use of him to belabor a plot line. Also the character of El Nino was ridiculous and seemed to be nothing more than an embarrassing stereotype. He had the dimensionality of a cartoon character. So I was very disappointed in Angel and would not strongly recommend it to anyone."
4,better than alienist,"I enjoyed the Alienist, but I actually think this one is better. The same attention to historical detail is there and the same twists of plot. Additionally, the same characters are in this book, but they are much more human and likeable than in the first. I admit, some of the plot twists were ""eye rollers"" but Carr pulls it off and makes them fit. He also tones down some of his animosity towards religion in this book, although some of the liberal overtones are still there.In this book, the criminal is already known and most of the book is spent trying to bring her to justice and the court trial. The main characters have grown a lot between novels. I actually liked the doctor in this one, whose character is better rounded out, along with the others. The book is written from the view point of Stevie, who has a sense of humor and insight into the others.The only things I did not like were the somewhat exaggerated twists in the plot and the ever obnoxious female detective."
3,Great research,"The best thing about Caleb Carr's New York novels is their level of research. He recreates Gotham of the turn of the last century to a tee, with just a hint of Gothic effect to highlight his gruesome plotlines. This book, however, is not as exciting as The Alienist, as Carr tackles an important issue like women's identity in a changing world with a lot of good intention but not one smidgeon of authenticity or true compassion. The book is at its best when it departs from the main plot and its horrible Clarence Darrow tie-in and returns to the Lower East Side lives of the narrator, fourteen-year-old Stevie, and his girl Kat, where I found the truly moving drama and suspense of the novel. But sequels are seldom as good as originals, and for a Gotham-nut like me, the mere fact of Stevie's authentic voice (another Carr strong suit) was more than enough to make up for the pasted-on mystery plot."
3,Not the page-turner I expected...,"I usually manage to finish a book every wek or so, but this one took almost five. Granted, it was over 700 pages, but as other readers have commented, a lot of that could have come out. the book just moved too slowly. Several times I started tp give up and move on to something else, but I did feel compelled to finish it. I am glad that I did - once we got to the trial it picked up, and I really enjoyed it from that point on. Too bad that was 3/4 of the way through. I would only recommend this to someone that I knew to be a history buff. Or very patient."
2,"The ""Kitchen Sink Effect""","Sometimes there can be too much of a good thing, as the reader will soon learn when reading this book. Too many characters to keep track of, giving his lead characters too little to do, and burying the reader with one deus ex machina after another were just some of the frustrations with this follow up to a much more suspenseful and clever book,The Alienist. Carr seems to suffer from the disease that many Stephen King books have, a lack of judicious editing. A decent idea buried under all this extraneious material."
2,Uhmmm....,"I know this won't be an eloquent review, but i'm tired at the moment. I found the storyline interesting enough to read, but the writing and the minute things that happened in the story were extremely frustrating. Things like characters finding time to have 3 pages of idle chit chat when they have urgent matters at hand. *sigh* I'm glad it's over."
4,Historically rich psychological mystery,"Carr's most recent work is told with Hemmingway like simplicity while focusing on complex Freudian issues. Carr's tale is woven around the concept of the unfit mother taken to another level. Exploring the female role as mother in society, this historical mystery addresses modern questions . The slow pace of the first chapters quickly increases with pivotal information unfolding at each corner moving the reader along with the novel's full bodied cast of characters. Steve Taggert is a likeable first persona narrator and Carr effectively creates a strong empathy for our guide. Overall, a great read!"
2,"Some strengths, but a letdown overall","I had high hopes for this book, but there was nothing here to compare to the vivid descriptions of old Manhattan and the bloodcurdling suspense of ""The Alienist"" (and I'm not referring to the gore; the eeriest part of that book for me was the discovery of the killer's stint as a Federal employee). To the comments about Stevie's ""what/that"" confusion, I would add his constant use of ""what you might call"" every time he used an unlikely term. The character of El Nino was poorly developed, and the characters from the first book were largely drained of complexity (Moore whines, dines, and gambles; Sara draws her derringer or kicks someone in the shins every two seconds; the Isaacsons bicker; Montrose plays the piano; and the Doctor noises). The book's saving graces were the setting, the scenes involving Darrow, Clara's character, and the relationship between Stevie and Kat. I'll certainly look out for Carr's future efforts, but this was a disappointment."
4,A worthy sequel,"""A sequel to 'The Alienist'? YES! "" I actually shouted that out loud in a library when I was told about ""The Angel of Darkness."" Again, Caleb Carr paints an intricate portrait of Golden Age New York, and brings back all the great characters from ""The Alienist,"" utilizing a unique twist in changing his narrator from society reporter John Moore to the street-smart Stevie Taggert, whose less-than-perfect grammar doesn't obscure his keen observations. Again, Carr utilizes real-life historical figures, most notably a young Clarence Darrow, to bring authenticity to the story of a female child-murderer and the investigation that brings her heinous crimes to light. So why only four stars? Those of you who have read Ann Rule's ""Small Sacrifices"" will see a lot of Diane Downs in murderer Libby Hatch--in fact, Carr cites Rule's book as an influence. Overall, though, a great sequel--can't wait for the next one!"
4,Violent crime hidden behind a veil of femininity and charm,"An imaginative and unique plot line with numerous sub-plots is presented against an extremely creative background. The characters are well-developed, and the writing is period authentic. Narrated by a young, reformed street urchin, the story unfolds in the streets of New York, circa 1895. References to historical figures of the period hold the reader's attention.Two Jewish detective sergeants, an alienist of German descent, a New York Times reporter, a female private investigator, and sundry drivers, aides, etc. join together to stop a vicious and evil woman who hides for years behind her femininity and charm.This book is an easy read with a delightful style and flow. The historical content is particularly appealing to people who can trace their family history to the New York metropolitan area of the late 1800's."
3,Worth a look IF you've read The Alienist,"If you've read The Alienist - perhaps one of the finest pieces of historical fiction ever written - then this book is certainly worth reading, if only to see a little more of the characters you know in a different situation and in a different light. However, if you haven't yet read The Alienist, read that first. The Angel of Darkness is about a different crime, but takes place later and so gives a lot of the first book away (who was killed, who did what, ""whodunnit"", etc.)All in all, a shaky but not unworthy effort, best appreciated if you liked The Alienist."
3,"Historical thriller, but less history, more thriller","A mismatched group of investigators, spearheaded by a touch-feely Dr. Kreizler, investigate the crimes of a suspected kidnapper in Angel of Darkness. The story is narrated by a rootbeer-drinking adolescent with ties to New York's underworld. The investigators seem to build a firm case against Libby Hatch, and come close to understanding her psyche (clearly Munchausen's syndrome--not even mentioned in the author's acknowledgements) but she slips through their fingers. The novel seems to deteriorate after that, with the author turning to street brawls and other cliches to keep the story going. The novel seemed to have very little connection to New York in the 19th century, and the tv-movie type ending is really pathetic. The reader is never really convinced of Libby Hatch's ferocity, there's very little suspense, and many aspects of the story are unconvincing."
3,Well researched but not the Alienist,"I would probably rank this book a 3.5 if I could. I really did enjoy a lot about it but it was just too long and boring in certain areas. Frankly, this ain't no Alienist. However, Carr loads up so much interesting turn-of-the-century history; at the same time, in providing so much history, he puts in far too many real life characters. Of course, I can't complain when good ol' TR shows up. While I hope there are further sequels with the same crew from this book and the Alienist, I certainly hope it's a better book. Finally, the last 100-200 pages really are exciting!"
4,The wait for the Alienist sequel is over,"Since ""The Alienist"" was my favorite book of the past few years, I had been waiting anxiously for the next Caleb Carr book. Much to my delight, ""The Angel of Darkness"" is a sequel to that wonderful book. The story line, characters, and historical tie-ins are just as engrossing as in Mr. Carr's previous novel. I was captivated throughout, until Teddy Roosevelt shows up to contribute to a ridiculous conclusion. Still, I recommend reading it, at least until up to the last twenty pages. You may want to make up your own ending. Despite the finale, I can't wait for Carr's next work!"
4,carr does it again but in a different style,"reading the reviews that were made before me i realized how passionate people get about books. thats what makes literature so involving. i felt captivated by this book and found myself flowing through the book quickly, considering the length (600+ pages). i thought this book would be written in the same style as the previous novel, the alienist, angel of darkness caught me off guard with it's slower courtroom drama. the plot takes longer to develop than the alienist but don't let that deter you from picking this book up, because once it starts, it really get's moving."
5,give the oscar to carr,"'the angel of darkness' is the second best book i've ever devoured by caleb carr, 'the alienist' being the first. i say devoured because it took me less than a week to read each of them. carr is refered to as an author of historical fiction, i agree and he does it well. it is the vivid detail and descriptions of all he is writing about. i've read some of the reviews and everybody is complaining about stevie and his language. i think carr writes in character-he's developed them all. caleb, the next one has to be from cyrus - so many directions in the 1800's to take that. miss howard would be my second choice.. whoever 'writes' it, i'll be waiting for another enjoyable week..,."
5,"excellent, a great read, a well woven plot","I just finished this book and I could not put it down until the exciting finish. The lenght of this book only added value to me. The story was well written, the plot rich and exciting and the charcters moved the plot along without the usual slowness. The story told by Stevie was like being there while young Stevie told the tale. Please Mr. Carr give us more."
2,Skip it.,"The Alienist was a terrific story - I bought several copies as gifts for friends. But the Angel of Darkness was annoying; too many extraneous characters just in the story to prove the author did his research. The major problem I had is that the ""gang"" was hired to find a kidnapped baby. Well, they get totally sidetracked, and go chasing all over the place, forgetting the thing they were supposed to do! Who cares if they leave this kid in dire peril, they've got to do research to get the kidnapper on bigger charges! Totally implausable ending, and generally way too many unnecessary details. Doesn't this guy have an editor??"
3,A Disappointing Follow-Up,"As intrigued and excited as I was to pick-up Caleb Carr's sequel to ""The Alienist"", I found myself increasingly frustrated by Carr's reliance on too many words to describe unimportant events. Carr's skill at painting a time and a place in the most fascinating details as in ""The Alienist"", gets lost here in what feels like a more labored attempt to churn out this book. The plot begins in the similarly quaint and charming style of its predecessor, but it soon veers off into a pedantic adventure, culminating in a quite unbelievable climax that could only be found in a bad, formulaic B-movie. The book is more than one hundred pages too long."
4,A good sequel,"Most sequels are disappointing. This one is not. Indeed I enjoyed it more than The Alienist. To be sure, there are loose ends and a feebleness in the central premise (why doesn't the mom of the kidnapped baby go to the police?). All in all, a good book. From one avid reader to others: buy this one. Recommended."
3,Entertaining but not up to prequel,"It took me a long time to get into this book. I was travelling for business and took this for my plane and hotel read. Sorry to say after 2 weeks I hadn't gotten past page 50.The writing did not convey the atmosphere of turn of the century New York as The Alienist did.The story was more predictable with fewer surprises.Many reviewers lament the fact that Stevie is the narrator for this episode. I found nothing wrong with the story from his point of view, it just wasn't a very good story.Perhaps Mr. Carr is intending to have each of his characters narrate future volumes. An interesting idea if so."
3,Deus ex machina rears its ugly head!,"Disappointing sequel to a superb historical thriller (The Alienist). This one was much too long, the villain was much less persuasive, and the ending was a lame use of deus ex machina (""God from the machine""), a completely artificial intervention by a powerful outside force to ""save the day."""
3,"Plot flaws, but a page-turner","I'd have to agree with an earlier reviewers comment that this novel contains some rather annoying plot flaws that defy belief; however, the novels characters are a compelling hodgepodge that make the novel a real page-turner. I could also do without the heavy dose of social moralizing that the author beats us over the head with. And sometimes the rhythm of Carr's style becomes rather distracting, especially when any narrative voice is involved. The dialogue between the characters is lively and full of wit. Lots of gallows humor, which is needed for such a dreadful tale of murder. Perhaps the plot flaws are a result of the novel being over 700 pages as it seems that Carr is paid by the word like Dickens,an author whom he clearly likes to imitate. If you can overlook the flaws, which is easy, you'll enjoy this thriller."
3,just beginning,"This is a book by Carr what I am reading now, and though I liked The Alienist there is one grammatical issue what is kind of annoying me. Any guesses?"
1,Should be ZERO stars,"Do NOT waste your time reading this insipid, tedious and ultimately boring follow up to the superior ""The Alienist"". If it wasn't the middle of summer, I would have used the book (all 750 pages of it) as kindling."
3,Intersting but too much info,"Don't get me wrong, this is an interesting book!! However, it could have been more interesting if we delved into his childhood and personality as more of the basis of the book. Ths book kept on-track pretty well - but veered off talking about a victim's friend or event. There were other serial killers being sought after at the same time and sometimes, you weren't' quite sure of who he was talking about.Maybe part of the reason they didn't delve into his peronality, is because he never admitted killing anyone and had an excuse for every situation He was a pretty smart guy. No matter what, it certainly would have been interesting to hear more about his childhood than to veer off the story line with a mini story regarding a victim.I guess it just could have been more psychologcal than it was...it was an interesting book though but got boring at times with legal talk."
3,The Angel of Darkness,"I had high hopes for this book, as I enjoyed ""The Alienist"" very much. It was an overall disappointment, though still quite readable. I found it too often predictable, with passages whose outcomes were so obvious. Yet Mr. Carr would spell them out anyway, as if the readers couldn't surmise it on their own. I was also disappointed with his summation, in which we (theoretically) would discover the intricacies of the pathological mind of his killer. After all, Dr. Kreizler and his gang spent the better part of the book analyzing it themselves. When we're finally presented with the ""why"" of her crimes, the answer comes off as weak and uninteresting as yesterday's toast."
3,A (mostly) readable sequel...,"First of all, I like historical fiction when it's well done. Second, I like distinct authorial voices. Third, I *loathe* when the narrative tells you something is going to happen, describes it happening, and then talks about what just happened. This book could have been pared down by at least a hundred pages simply by dropping the super-annoying hints that things would get worse for the hardy band of investigators or describing how bad things just got for the hardy band of investigators. It's still a decent read, though. It's just not nearly as good as ""The Alienist""."
2,Nowhere near as good as 'The Alienist',"After loving 'The Alienist,' I was very disappointed in 'The Angel of Darkness.' It was completely implausible, especially the 'Angel' being on good terms with a street gang. And the midget was just too much. A big disappointment."
3,Not bad,"While I would refer the reader to Jason Phillips' review as closest to my own opinion of this book, I would add that I found the Picton-Darrow courtroom confrontation fascinating. Picton's comments that we are seeing the future of the legal profession and courtroom shenanigans in Darrow are astute. His remark that if that is so, he will be trying his last case won my admiration."
2,Fire Your Editor,"I purchased this for my Kindle. I'm over half done and am bumfuddled as to how this got out of editing. Virtually every page has transposed letters, words run together, misspellings, wrong pronouns. I don't know if the Kindle version of a book receives less scrutiny but I can honestly say I've never read any book, paper or electronic, with more errors per square inch. I would give the story a 'B' but the editing is an 'F-'."
3,"Wordy, wordy, wordy","Like many others, I loved the Alienist and read this for more of the same. Maybe enough was too much, but Angel was too wordy and explained too much. The dialogue was constructed as if the reader (and the characters in the book) were dunderheads who couldn't understand the action without endless repetition and explication. I don't think that was necessary and it slowed the book a lot. Also, I agree with the earlier comment that late 20th century mores, especially about the status of women, were applied to the late 19th century, which I think was done with a wink and a smirk, without real sincerity. That was the least believable part of a book that requires the reader to suspend credulity on every page. Parts were enjoyable, but, alas, the whole was less than the sum of the parts."
4,I loved it!,"Some of my favorite books have a slow start. I've learned to perservere and am sometimes rewarded. This is the case with Angel of Darkness. When I was through, I was sorry it was over. I found myself thinking about the book everytime real life intruded and I had to put it down. I enjoyed the characters and their dialogue, learning about turn of the century New York, early forensics and its fight to be recognized as viable investigative technique. The exploration of the taboo, dark side of womankind was intriquing. I havn't read The Alienist yet, but if it's better than Angel, I know I'm in for a treat! I can hardly wait for it to arrive."
2,"Could be a lot better, but a nice read","I wish the author had spent even more time on the day-to-day life of turn-of-the-century New York. His insertion of a few historical characters (Teddy Roosevelt & others)adds artificiality to the plot, which could stand on its own just fine without them. Also, the book could be a couple hundred pages shorter .... I'd rather he had used the space to flesh out the atmosphere more, rather than puffing up all the dialogue. I lost interest partway through, but finished it."
5,Angel of Darkness swoops down for the kill!,"Caleb Carr strikes again with his eclectic band of late 19th century American detectives. If you couldn't put Carr's Alienist down, then you are prime for Angel of Darkness. In this sequel to Alienist, the tale is told by an adult Stevie Taggert, who fans will remember as the rag-tag boy who narrowly escaped death in the previous novel. His fresh storytelling is compelling and draws the reader into the decadent world of late 19th century New York City. This is Carr at his best, giving us his unique view of lower Manhattan with such alacrity that we can smell the acrid aromas that accompany a large city during a hot, hazy, hazardous summer. We even get a bit of international intrigue that twists the plot through its serpentine course.An excellent read."
3,Not exactly as well paced as I would've liked.,"My uncle suggested this book to me, telling me it ""It's great. You'll love it!"" Well, I must say, yes and no. The characters are interesting, original, make you think, and the dialouge is intelligent and not sluggish at all, but the book itself is very slow, and very tedious. I was dissapointed.However, this is a good book. I would suggest, though, that you read it first at the library or bookstore before buying. Not one of Caleb Carr's best."
2,"Shallow and long, not a good combination","The book really was a diappointment. It was way too long (where was the editor?) going into endless detail that just flattened the narrative. So many of the introduced characters, mostly the villains were without depth (but also El Nino, a ""good guy""-was stereotyped bordering on racist)which really put a damper on things. The narrative was also predictable, you just knew who was doomed, and who was not. Really not worth the read."
4,A wonderful suspense,"Caleb Carr has done it again! I simply loved Angel of Darkness. Such unique characters and it is this very uniqueness and diversity of each characters that makes this book so interesting. The ending took me by surprise. However, I am still unclear about the involvement of Vanderbilt, why did he go out of his way to hire Darrow in defense of Hatch? If anyone has the answer, please post them."
4,I think my fingers molded themselves to the cover.,"It was cleverly written, much different than most suspense novels i have read. I was on the edge of the couch, and i had to often stop myself from peeking to the end of the book. Carr is defiently someone i would like to see more of. If he keeps up the good work he has me as a fan for life!!"
3,"Suspensful ""page turning"" sequences far between.","Where it's suspensful it is great, but the narator, Stevie, does too many things not relevant to the plot. Too much focus on smoking, drinking and eating. It is enough to know that the characters enjoy a smoke, but we don't need to know about EVERY smoke. One third fewer words would be about right."
3,This book is too long,Angel of Darkness is well worth reading even if it has too many words and is too long.It does read rather quickly. Fascinating exploration of turn of the century interpretations of malicious behavior.
4,"Rounds out ""The Alienist""","The reader will get so much more from this novel after first reading ""The Alienist."" The first book introduces the characters, but this second novel offers more. I thought Libby Hatch, her methods and motives, were even more well-presented and absorbing than those of the villain in the first book. There was more action as well. I had the tiniest bit of trouble accepting the idea that one person could design and construct an elaborate underground tunnel, but it didn't get in the way of my enjoyment of the story. The reader will be treated to a murder mystery, a psychological thriller, a courtroom drama and vivid historical snapshot all in one. Top-notch."
2,Wanted: a good editor,"This book is a classic case of a guy with a first good novel, given virtually free reign to write his second book. Extremely slow paced (one chapter goes on for several pages, and simply describes the main character going to get the doctor in a carriage). Or maybe the author was paid by the word. Worth a look at because the Alienist was so good, but be prepared to be bored during large stretches of the book."
1,trades on real-life tragedy,"I loved The Alienist and expected to love this book too. I found it slightly disappointing, though -- even before we got to the part that really outraged me. Essentially, the main crime in Angel of Darkness is lifted, all but verbatim, fromSmall Sacrifices: A True Story of Passion and Murder. This is a true-crime book about a tragedy that affected real people who are alive today. We aren't talking about simply drawing inspiration, either; the crime, the victims and especially the courtroom scenes are taken very, very blatantly from the other book. I listened to this on audiobook and therefore do not know if Carr credited that book in his notes. But I found such extreme copying of a tragedy affecting children both uncreative and ghoulish. I have felt no need to read anything else by this author since."
3,"Disappointing compared to ""The Alienist"".","I read ""The Alienist"" and could hardly put it down. That is why I expected much more of Carr's sequel. Although I was interested enough in the story to read on, there were almost no surprises, very little psychological analysis, which was so successfully incorporated into ""The Alienist"", and only a modicum of suspense. Stevie's running narrative - with its odd mixture of the word ""what"" and terms that few former street urchins would have used - was also unconvincing. Finally, after the 700+ page build-up, the ending was a complete let down. In all, had the story been paired down to maybe 300-400 pages, maybe I would have enjoyed it more."
4,Getting Better.,"I don't know if I can say I was ever made so angry by a book as I was by the Alienist. It was a book of great detail on top of detail that just sort of flubbed out at the end. It was a ghastly book that compelled me to read on. At the end, it seems that Mr. Carr got tired of writing and put a stop to it. But with The Angel of Darkness, he has redeemed himself to me.With Libby Hatch case, he brought about all the massive details and insights of the former book and gave a most satisfying end to it. Though it has been quite a few years since the last installment, I am looking forward to read Miss Howard's account of the next yarn."
2,A disappointment after the achievement of The Alienist.,"After Carr's first novel, I hoped for great things from him. However, The Angel of Darkness was a real disappointment. There was not the same evocation of place (turn-of-the-century New York) that helped to make The Alienist so fascinating. Details from the time merely seemd to be leftover facts from the first novel. The narrator was unconvincing and inconsistant--Stevie moved from poor grammar to sophisticated language and I found that extremely grating. The plot was slow moving and the characters were basically the same ones we met in his first novel. I hope Carr is done with this group of characters and moves on to new ground for his next novel; he can do better than this."
3,Still on top of his game,"Carr is a contemporary writer who I have gained great respect for. This book, although not as good as 'The Alienist', is still very enjoyable. The characters are continued and as always Carr's research of New York is well appreciated. If you have not read Carr's work his historical research is something you should become familiar with. You will learn details about New York places and people that you did not previously know."
1,Boring and a waste of paper.,A sad attempt at a sequel to The Alienist. Slow and clunky to read. Stared slow and got worse.
1,How the heck can people consider this book *good?*,"This was the most tiresome, droll, straight-out boring novel that I have ever tried to read...I had to stop reading partway through simply because I was bored to tears. And not only did the plot seem to develop at a snail's pace, but the grammar (yes I know it was told from a street urchin's point of view and that's how he would probably talk) and sheer verbose-ness of the text were horrible as well. I found myself having to read the same page/paragraph two/three times before I could even figure out what Carr was trying to get across!Don't waste your money on this one. Pathetic book."
3,"Not as good as The Alienist, but a fun read!","Carr doesn't deliver the goods as well in his sophomore attempt as he did with his freshman work: The Alienist. However, I must confess that I preferred the ""point of view"" used in this book to that used in the Alienist. The story here is the problem. The characters are just as rich and well textured, but the plot line feels thin and too much like a contemporary Lifetime: Television for Women movie of the week. It starts out strong, but Carr seems to have lost interest as he kept writing.I DID enjoy reading the book, but when I'd finished, I wished it had been a rich and complex as his first novel."
2,"Like beer, if 1 is good, 2 are great unless you're an alkie","The Alienist it isn't. The Angel of Darkness seemingly picks up where The Alienist left off but for as far as I've read (page 50), there isn't the slightest similarity between the prose of the two books. If you're still not dissuaded, keep in mind that the voice of this book is ""Stevie;"" the streetwise juvenile delinquent. Proceed with caution or at most, check it out of the library. I hate being taken to the cleaners on hard cover books, don't you?"
2,A good story but......,"The Angel of Darkness is a good story but the author should have stopped with The Alienist. Carr's new book is more of the same, and as a matter of fact to much more of the same. Perhaps those who have not read The Alienist will find this book more entertaining, but even a first time reader of Carr will find this book a bit tedious to read."
5,beautiful,"love is colder than death's darkwave ethereal music is beautiful and utterly unique. It takes you to another dimension, one of dark bliss and heavenly night."
1,junky slop swing,"Uh. Don't know what to say. A band that has extended itself way behind the length of it's valid exsistance. Bad vocals, Terrible (seriously), terrible horns. Weak songs.If you saw the band in their prime (3 or 4 years ago) you'd know they are great. This recording represents a desperate attempt at rehasing their smaller prior success.Pathetic."
5,"Jazzy blues, mature & real.","Captivating sound, easy to listen to all tracks, mixture of jazzy blues. Very fitting voice for lyrics together with always present saxophone makes it interesting and fresh. 'Good and deep' take on life."
2,too jazzy,"Gee, this is my first negative review for Chris Rea. Why? Well I expect it is because this cd moved away from what one might associate with Chris Rea....it may be of liking to jazz enthusiasts, but it was too jazzy and mundane for my taste.""Dancing With Strangers"" is a good representation of early Chris Rea (and IMO very good) I would also recommend ""The Blue Cafe"" and ""King Of The Beach"" where you can get many good tunes that are not on his ""best of"" CD's.I am the only negative review, but I think these folks appreciate jazz a bit more than I do. I love the sax as a compliment to music and even though the sax in this cd was done well, it couldn't save this flat and somewhat drab cd."
4,Something for everyone,"Numerous ideas and projects for various styles. More ideas and photos than actual instuctions. Great ideas, fun to look through."
1,These are jeans?,"They don't feel, look or in any way resemble jeans (blue or otherwise). They fall somewhere between khaki's (in appearance} and geriatric stretch pants.To say I hate them would be an understatement. They make me look and feel 40 years older.(but by the time I pay for round trip shipping...well, I've paid for the pants)....so consider carefully. These are stretch pants: not denim, not blue, not jeans.This review has been edited to note that the item description has changed since I wrote the review. I likely would not have purchased them to begin with as they are currently described. I am glad that Amazon edited the description to better reflect the product.I still do not like them and they wound up at Goodwill. Hopefully they will find a better home with someone who can see them, try them on... and not rely on a description. These might well work for some folks. they didn't for me."
5,Comfortable But,"The slacks are comfortable with just enough stretch. However, they are too long and the fabric is a bit rough and catches everything. Nevertheless I enjoy wearing them and am thinking about buying a second pair. It's also a good value. Would prefer a shorter length and a better fabric."
5,Now I know Bonhoeffer,"In this work, Bonhoeffer's student and friend brought me closer to Bonhoeffer than I thought possible. Previously, I had thought Letters and Papers From Prison was as close as I could get to understanding the ""religionless"" Christian -I was wrong. Bethge's opus gives an incisive look into the formation of Bonhoeffer the man and the theologian which sheds more light on his Christian fortitude in the Nazi tempest. I whole-heartedly recommend this work for it has been an inspiration to me as a human being as well as a student of theology"
5,A classic -- Bethge is indispensable,"Eberhard Bethge was Dietrich Bonhoeffer's closest friend and the lifelong editor and interpreter of his life and writings. For the first time we now have the completely unabridged biography in a revised and updated English translation. This is not only a classic of twentieth century biography; it also addresses key issues not only of German and European history, World War II, and the Holocaust but also, through Bonhoeffer's theology, the church and modernity. It sharply poses the question of authentic Christian life. A big book and a challenging read!"
5,Christian Fortitude,"An outstanding, detailed and gripping story of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's Christian fortitude. Eberhard Bethge's exquisitely detailed knowledge and references about Bonhoeffer's life, from beginning to end is a wonderful tribute to Bonhoeffer. The reader asks the question what possessed Bonhoeffer to pursue the dream of a restive German society with Christianity abounding. Unless one has lived under a dictatorship perhaps this makes one restless. This book provides clear and concise answers."
5,Bat earrings,"These earrings were very well packaged, adorable and I would reccommed them to any bat lover, like myself! :)"
5,DIVINE AT THE HACIENDA IN MANSCHESTER!!!,"I really like this DVD of Divine live from the Hacienda. This was a must buy for me because Divine performs the classics of the 80's. This was filmed in 1983 when Hi-NRG was at its peak, and when Hi-NRG was still very underground. This is great for anyone who likes Divine or Hi-NRG music. Although, Divine does some tasteless things throughout the show, it's still a gem to add to the Divine Collection. Any Bobby ""O"" fans also need to buy this. Bobby ""O"" isn't in the video, but just knowing that Bobby ""O"" produced most of Divine's classics is another reason to purchase this video. Buy this and keep it. One of these days it will be out of print, so get it while you can. In case you did not know the Hacienda is owned by New Order."
5,Own a piece of history,"Many of us know and love Divine from all the John Waters movies. Divine was explosively created and talented.But from these movies, you get an incomplete picture of Glenn Milstead. (Divine.) SHe also had a fantastic night club act. SHe entertained all over Europe with this act in the 80'sSo get this DVD and experience the raw talent of Divine. HIr talent was raw and raunchy in more ways than one! But we still love HIr!"
1,copy,the sound is so bad itrs a piece of junk. i would like my money back for that the sound is totally bassed and i want a refund.
5,mine are old,i do NOT own this item i have the mini con version =/ the truck is realy green named ransack the jeep dune runner (watch the little rol lcage i lsot mine alot)and the tracter is iceburg =) they are an exeptional value i aint got any new ones in 3 years but im gettign back into it all i ahve in armada and reissue 3 bluestreak (they chaged his name too blue streak) but about these if they are as i expect knowing modern compaines anything for a dollar the red one has a little rope when u push it forward it winds the little rope mine have held of exeptionaly well i hope you enjoy yours =) sionarra(i think thats how u sspell it)
2,I wanted to like it . . . .,"So much talent, such spectacular scenery, and yet, this film put me to sleep like a horse tranquilizer. What the filmmakers apparently intended to portray as a father/son reunion brimming with angst, longing, anger, and regret, just didn't engage me. Period. The dialogue felt totally stale. Some of the scenes seemed interminable. The only refreshing character was Sam Shepard's mother, who reminded me a lot of the plucky widows I have met out in Nevada. Full disclosure: I turned it off about four fifths of the way through -- just couldn't keep my eyes open."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring !!!","I love Sam Shepard. But I hated this film. It really had a lot of potential, and the story was basically good, but the way the movie was put together was terrible. I kept waiting for something memorable to happen, but it just never did. This movie was sort of like watching the pilot of a new TV series -- you know, where the viewer is just getting some background information about what's going on, and where the characters don't seem quite comfortable with one another yet. The film tried to be artsy but fell way short. The mention of Sundance and Cannes on the box caught my interest, but I should have remembered that those highbrow endorsements mean absolutely nothing to the average filmgoer like me, who is just looking for entertainment. This movie was not entertaining in the least."
4,Don't Come Knocking Captures Butte,"I was lucky enough to live in Butte, Montana in the 90s, and this film perfectly captures Butte. I enjoyed the film, not Wim Wenders very best, but it has its charms. I'm writing this for people who would like to see Butte and don't have a plane ticket in hand. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, and you feel like you really are there, Uptown, on the Richest Hill on Earth."
5,Awesome first book in the Harvath series!,I first read Lions several years ago and I was hooked. I have since read all of Brad Thor's Harvath novels and love them all. Lions was such a great book because it set the foundation for the Harvath series in that it developed the character and gave a lot of insight and background into him. This was a very well written book that continues to keep the reader hook all throughout. I simply could not put this book down until I was finished. It left me salivating for the next book in the series and I couldn't get my hands on it fast enough. Brad Thor has a reader for life! I highly recommend this book and recommend that you read it first before reading any of the other Harvath books.
3,"Good News, Bad News","If you like Ludlumesque chasing around Europe, Brad Thor's your man and Lions is your book. But be ready for a pretty far-fetched plot, one that involves treason by 2 U.S. Senators, the head of the Secret Service and the Vice President. The fantastically well-armed and organized bad guys become The Gang Who Couldn't Shoot Straight when they are gunning for our hero, Agent Harvath--there must be 10 times when they shoot at him and miss. The book is fast-paced, but lacks the believability needed to truly capture the reader."
2,over the top and silly,"Brad Thor has a penchant for writing big action stories and this is no exception, but the plot is so outrageous and unbelievable that it's difficult to take this novel seriously. The whole kidnapping of the president and government conspiracy behind it was not remotely realistic. His main character, Scott Harvath, is interesting, but the situations that he gets involved with lend no credibility to the character. I spent the entire book saying to myself, you have got to be kidding. I find myself wanting to like Brad Thor as a writer, but his novels don't deliver and this is no exception.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
1,Not What I Was Hoping For,"Any comparisons to Vince Flynn or Robert Ludlum are WAY off base. The dialog was brutal, at times cringe-inducing, the storytelling weak. The main character (Harvath) is not compelling at all, the rest of the characters are one dimensional. Perhaps Thor gets better in later books, but I'll take Mitch Rapp any day of the week over Harvath. Was a chore to complete...."
2,"Add a Star for ""Jargon""","Cartoonish best describes this book. Our trusty hero runs around spouting silly things like ""sweep and creep"" and the like and we are expected to believe this is how the US Secret Service personnel truly talk. I speak from experience when I say, a load of rubbish.The plot was predictable at best, but to be honest, drawn out would be a better description.There was plenty of action, unfortunately none of it made sense. The entire Secret Service is made to look like a bunch of idiots, except of course for our hero. (And no, I'm not a secret service agent)The whole thing is just not believable. From Swiss super mercenaries that no one seems to know about, to the tired plot device of a big government conspiracy, the whole thing just sort of sits there like a bad exercise in cliches.Don't bother. I wish I hadn't."
4,The Ex-Navy Seal,"THE LIONS OF LUCERNE By Brad ThorThe Ex-Navy SealYou'd have a hard time beating the start of this one. The president is kidnapped on a ski slop in Utah and a whole team of Secret Services men are killed while Scot Harvath is busy saving the president's daughter.Scot finds himself breaking a several rules before he makes any headway finding out where the president is being held. The people holding the president are formable foes and have their own sect. Scott takes off for Switzerland where he has some information that the president may be held.It looks like a collation in his own backyard is responsible for the kidnapping, and now Scott is charged with murder. The story builds up to bloody climax in Switzerland."
3,Nice yarn for a quiet weekend/summer read,"Brad Thor is immensely popular, but this is my first time reading one of his works. I like to ""start at the beginning"" so this was the logical first book for me to read. While there were times I felt the dialogue slowed the action unnecessarily, this was a nice action read. I'll keep reading (a good sign) in the series."
2,"You can do better, Brad","Go a little lighter on the attributive adjectives! Many of the nouns he describes are generic but overall, good story teller. I'll check the next book out to he if he's improving."
2,Don't Bother With This One!,"When I started reading The Lions Of Lucerne, the first of Brad Thor's series featuring Secret Service Agent, Scot Horvath, I thought I was in for a real exciting reading experience. However, shortly thereafter my high expectations rapidly deteriorated. Reading this book became the equivalent of reading an action comic book, with the hero being a combination of an indestructible superman and a one-man army. Horvath's main character (and secondary characters) lost all credibilty for me to the point that I'm not sure if I want to read any of Thor's other books in this series (even though I own these books). Beyond Thor's weakness in character development, his dialogue is often cliched and, perhaps most annoying, is that the plot moves at too slow a pace throughout much of the book and is very predictible. Do yourself a favor and don't bother reading The Lions Of Lucerne."
1,I'll pass,"Some books just don't hook a reader. After 50 pages I was done with this Harold Robbins wanna be. Too many hard to take characters, money, and silly thoughts from passing characters did me in."
1,Best not read,"Unfortunately for me I have a hard time putting a book own even if I dislike it. I am an avid mystery reader and I found this book horribly dissapointing. The characters are shallow at best, the plot completely predictable and the details as credible as the the authors name. I should have known better....my bad"
1,Very Predictable,"This book was so stupid and predictabe, please people do not waste your time reading this piece of garbage. Thor should not even be a writer. What you guys should do instead of wasting your time on this book is put on a good Bond film."
4,Entertaining and fast moving,"Thor hooked from the very fist page in this very first novel of his.It takes some nerve to try to kidnap the President of the U.S. Horvath, is a great character, that Thor created in the likes of Dirk Pitt and Jack Ryan. He stands out as his own man.I think he twisted and turned the plot just right without being too much over the top.If you get hooked you've got several good stories with Scot Horvath ahead of you"
5,The Lions of Lucerne,"Excellent summer read. Being the year of the Olympics, and the setting in London, it was easy to relate. The book kept your interest throughout with it's twists and turns."
4,"exciting,",Book is good and exciting. Just a little slow in developing. Well worth reading if you get thru the long winded parts.
1,Awful.,"Let me preface this review by what I expect from political and espionage stories. I want the author to conduct thorough research that supports the plot and make the plot plausible. Forsyth, Silva, DeMille, Clancy, Morell - they do a phenomenal job of that.This author doesn't. This book was so far away from believable, I rolled my eyes countless times. The president's entire detail is killed in a man-made avalanche and the terrorists kidnap the president. Right. Sure. That could happen. But one man survived, the main character. And for the rest of the book, he is the luckiest son of a bitch alive.The book is just silly. I don't want to rant anymore, but I'm ""one-and-done"" with Thor. He has a cool last name, but that's where it ends."
1,"Embarrassed for myself, Brad Thor, and Nelson DeMille.","Sophomoric writing in general, banal dialogue that seems to go on forever, plot contrivances bordering on the ridiculous and plot holes you could drive a Hum-Vee through, and a lead character, and by association an author, so bigoted and misogynistic that he should only be found at a Trent Lott for President rally, not as the hero of a novel. The authors comments about women and Middle Easterners, disguised as dialogue, are repulsive in the extreme. It is my hope that Mr. Thor will not write another book, but if this tripe has already gone into a paperback printing, he's probably sitting at his word processor right now. Hope it crashes."
3,The Lions of Lucerne,"The book was to form, interesting, suspenseful for the most part, and kept moving without undo delays in forward progress. The only thing that bothers me at times is that as good as Scot Harvath is deliberatly made out to be, he doesn't sometimes ""get it"" untill chapters and days later. I as the reader have been privy to the same information he has had and am way ahead in being able to figure out what happened or is going to happen. Therefore, I am not as excited as I should be when he does finally work it out. This creates a situation where the prose and writing style is the only thing that keeps me reading, with great gratitude when the unknown looms it's mysterious head."
1,Lions of Lucerne,"Great story if you're a fan of Mighty Mouse. Nothing of value that I could find, and I'll stick to Vince Flynn."
1,"This book was my 2nd try, but","again, I got the same feeling and conclusion as when I read the 1st one:Boring writing style, boring prose, boring scenarios, too right-wing crappy. failed to get connected no matter how hard I tried to read along, the reading was just like chewing a piece of cardboard with lot of ink on it."
3,Not bad for a debut novel...,"I just finished this book and must say that I was a little disappointed with it. What began with such promise seemingly evaporates in the last hundred pages....can someone say ""deadline"" ?? The other reviewers who talked about the sudden inability of master assassains to hit a target were, pardon the pun, dead on! The Claudia Mueller character appears early in the novel and is not seen again for nearly 300 pages. The Harvath charcter is good, but he is no Mitch Rapp! Brad Thor is good but he has a way to go to catch up with Vince Flynn.All that being said I will more than likely pick up Path of the Assassain when it comes out in paperback. Even my favorites like Ludlum and Cussler were still developing their tradecraft in their first novels. Thor deserves a second chance with this reader."
2,"First-Rate Action Scenes, but Little Else","THE LIONS OF LUCERNE is Brad Thor's debut novel written in 2002. Since writing this book, Thor has become a very successful author, with his most recent effort hitting #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list.Other than some very well written action scenes, this book has little to recommend it. The characterization is two-dimensional, the dialogue trite, and the hero Scot Horvath almost too bland for words. The political conspiracy plot is outlandish, and is structured in a manner that contains few surprises. I found the whole storyline to be almost painfully predictable, right down to the final showdown at the villain's mountain hideaway.THE LIONS OF LUCERNE is written well enough for a debut, but the plot and characterization problems made it a pretty mediocre reading experience. If you want to read a first rate action novel, my advice is to go with Lee Child instead, who is a far superior writer and plotter."
4,entertaining,"A ""new"" author on my book list and one that I find very well written. The hero makes plenty of mistakes and is able to improvise when necessary, I find this quite refreshing. It is an easy to follow book and quite entertaining while just lounging around the pool. I highly recommend this author and this book."
3,"Good, but Outdated","The Lions of Lucerne was a good read, but it had some trouble keeping my attention. While there is no shortage of action, it all seemed a bit watered down by not having enough tension built up between the good guys and bad guys in the novel. With that said, I am interested in reading more from Brad Thor."
3,Not bad but a little slow,"Not a bad recreational read, but I was a little disappointed in the story. A kind of 2nd class Vince Flynn."
4,good story,well written a little like a bond novel fast plot great characters reccomend to suspense thriller fans author has sveral books with this character
2,Suspend belief,A fast paced action thriller in which one must suspend belief that any single person could absorb as much physical punishment as the hero endures.
5,This is a GREAT book,This book kept me on my seat and up at night the whole time. It taking place near my home was just a bonus for me. I recommend this book for anyone.
3,A Breathless Beginning,"This first book in the Scot Harvath series begins so well that it is understandable that the ending isn't as satisfying as the first two-thirds of the book. The assassination-cum-kidnapping of the president is one thing, but the character of Harvath is such an interesting confection. He's a law and order enforcement individual who is so straight arrow in his convictions that Jack Ryan and Jason Bourne can't help but feel like anachronisms to a post-Nixonian era. Harvath fights for the ol' U.S.A. come rain or come shine and that's it. The action here, particularly an escape under the ice, is extraordinary. By the end, I knew I wanted more."
2,Weak political thriller,"""The Lions of Lucerne"" reads like a first novel. The prose has a somewhat amateurish tint to it, as do the plot and some of the action scenes. Just one example of completely amateurish writing: there is a scene in which the protagonist assaults an FBI agent for insulting him. No doubt that is supposed to show how macho he is. Just not done, folks. Assaulting a Federal officer is a felony; any questions? Scenes like this rob this novel of authenticity. Further, the plot just does not cut the mustard. If the US President were kidnapped by terrorists there would be an uproar many orders of magnitude greater than this book envisions. And the President would not be rescued by a disgraced lone maverick. More would be telling, but really, there is not much more to be told. RJB."
2,Painfully Awful Dialogue,"I would've given this book one star, except the plot has enough twists and the pacing is brisk enough to earn a bump. However, I know middle schoolers that can write less ridiculous dialogue. The author has an incredibly irritating tendency to have each character repeat the last two or three words that were just spoken to them. In the beginning, it was only a minor annoyance for me, but further into the book, having it occur in literally every conversation and up to 8 times on a single page, I wanted to scream. I would have thrown the book in the garbage if I hadn't been reading it on my Kindle."
3,Rookie Novel,"I recently discovered author Brad Thor. The first book I read was The Last Patriot. That was a tightly written novel. It lead me to purchase all of his previous books, with the intention to read them in the order they were written. So first up was The Lions of Lucerne. The plot was intriguing, the kidnapping of the President. But I did not find myself anxiously turning to the next page as I did with the first Thor novel I read. But considering it was his first book it was not too bad for a rookie."
4,Read one Brad Thor book and you'll be hooked,"If you like Jason Bourne, you'll love Scot Harvath. Non-stop action, international intrigue, romance. The story is a little far-fetched, but that's what makes Brad Thor's novels fun to read. You know you're going on a roller coaster ride. This time it's the President of The United States, kidnapped by diabolical mercenaries, hired by trusted members of government. The plot goes deeper than Scot could ever have imagined as he tries to find the President, while trying to regain his reputation and, more importantly, stay alive."
1,Absolute garbage,This could possibly be the worst book of it's type that I've ever read. I can't even bring myself to list all its failings. Please avoid this book like the plague. Try Vince Flynn instead.
1,can't write to save his life...,"If this mishmash of cliches and plot tangles and two-dimensional (sometimes just one) characters is what passes for a representative techno-thriller these days, then the genre is as dead as a doornail."
3,a little too Hollywood,"This is the first of Thor's books that I've read. It's fast moving and doesn't require a ton of attention (compared to say early, good Clancy). The story is compelling, but I got a little annoyed with Hollywood-style villians that were purportedly so talented, but repeatedly shoot and miss like they used to work for Cobra before GI Joe disbanded.All-in-all, an easy read that kept me entertained, but wasn't on a level with some of the other top stuff in the genre."
2,Predictable but entertaining,Predictable but entertainingHe kills the bad guys while making smokers feel guilty. In the end you just know the bad guy will be a business man of some kind. Evil fossil fuel users have blood on their hands once again...give me a break and a Clancy novel
2,Super Hero,Jack Bauer the hero of 24 has nothing on Scot Horvath the super navy seal turned secret service agent in this book. Seriously if you like the show 24 you will love this book.
5,Excellent Product,This book was delivered as advertised and arrived very quickly. I would highly recommend this seller.
1,He Built A Franchise On This?,"Completely agree with the reviewers who referenced the cringe-inducing dialogue, the one-dimensional characters, and the absurd plot contrivances (the villains are world class mercenaries, yet can't kill Our Hero with any of the hundreds of bullets they send his way).The protagonist and the plot of this book are also AWFULLY derivative of Vince Flynn's work. My advice is to stick with Flynn and avoid Thor. You'll be happy you did."
1,Save Your Money On This One,"If there was a zero to give for a rating on this book, that's what I would give it. Trite, stupid, ridiculous, uninteresting. Characters are impossible to like. The author should go back to his television show, maybe he does better at that. An author, he isn't. In my opinion."
2,Poorly written,"I can deal with a bad plot and charicature-level characters if the writing is halfway decent or at least the main character is interesting. This had no such redeeming features. Books like this make me feel like I should start writing novels, because apparently, creative writing skills are not a prerequisite."
4,Loved it,"This book was well thought out and full of facts with regard to the countries in which it took place. I thoroughly enjoyed it, it's a great read!"
4,Excellent Thriller,"I really enjoyed this book. I hesitate reading a lot of popular fiction because it gets rather obscene. A few of the bad guys swear in this, but, overall, not so bad. The story is really interesting. It weaves its way through so many paths that it is difficult to believe that they are all going to end up in the same place, but they do.Since it is one in a series about the same character, you know the good guys win. What you don't know is how. The bad guys are smart, just not as smart or tough as the hero.Lot of interesting details. Who knows if they are real? Who cares? They are still interesting.This is the second Brad Thor book I have read. I stumbled into the first one in a secondhand store. It was so interesting that I went looking for more. i will continue to look for them.If you like good action thrillers, I would recommend this to you."
4,"a good, fastpaced, fun read","Well, let me start off by telling you why this book received 4 stars from me instead of five. It was predictable, and the hero was almost too good to be true.Now....that said, I really did enjoy this book. I love thrillers (like Ludlum and Forysyth) and this book fits the bill. It was fast paced, very well written, I could see the action and feel some of the emotions. I think it is a great beginning for this author, and I look forward to his next book, and look forward to seeing this character again. So don't let the four stars stop you from reading it, just go into it with the knowledge that you will probably know where the author is going, but you will have fun if you go along for the ride."
2,Needs a Stern Editor,"Lord knows I love a good international military thriller, but in my not so humble opinion, this book could have benefitted from a stern editor. The prose and especially the dialogue is painfully stilted. Given how big Thor is in this genre, I was shocked to find that, for all the action-related goodness, he really doesn't seem to be a very good writer."
4,Scott,Read all the Vince Flynn series and was looking for a new author. I found the book to be a good one.My only complaint is that the descriptions of the scenes were a little to long making the book a little longer then it should have been. I plan on reading the whole series as once I like a character I tend to read them all such as Dirk Pitt by Clive Clusser and Mitch Rapp.
4,Fun read.,"This was the first Brad Thor book that I've read, and I will be finding more. Fun, fast paced."
4,The Lions of Lucerne,"Fast moving thriller - similar to watching ""24"" on TV. Author doesn't get too technical, but just enough to keep the plot interesting."
5,Print Shop Propublisher,It was a replacement of a program I've had for years that has worked extremely well for me.
5,Our Four Year Old LOVES This Book!,"Very compassionately written, this true story takes the reader (or audience) into a story about a baby chimp named Rickie, who is tragically separated from her mother by a hunter. Rickie is taken to a village to be sold, but a compassionate man (aptly referred to as 'Guardian') takes Rickie home with him and cares for her. When he goes on a business trip, Rickie bonds with Henri the scruffy dog.I don't want to spoil the ending, so I won't. Our four year old son loves this book, and he doesn't impress easily! He's never had a problem with sitting through it and I never once got the impression that it was over head or too much for him. The books holds much truth, in a manner very appropriate for younger ones.For myself, I loved the fact that Ms. Goodall refers to Henri and Rickie's ""owner"" as their Guardian, as it should be."
3,Not exactly what the box cover seems to advertize...,"Not uninteresting, but not what I had hoped to buy. Looking at the box cover, you might assume that the film is in color - wrong. Looking at the DVD release date, you might assume the film was made in the last few years. Again, wrong - it was made in the '70s, although the picture and sound quality are so poor that it might as well have been made in the '30s."
3,little disappointment,it says it's the original soundtrack but it's not. if you're a big fan of this movie you notice the cuts on this album are rerecorded in a studio. they're not the song cuts that are from the soundtrack. had i known this i might not have bought this album. the sampler from amazon doesn't give enough from the songs so that you realize this.
2,Robin and the 7 hoods,"I thought the CD was thrown together. Out of 16 tracks(two were labeled BONUS TRACK), four songs were repeats of two songs,and three of the 16 tracks were calle Studio chatter, which was the starsmumbing nothing of interest. Nine out of 16 and there were only three decentones of the nine. I'd like to believe Frank Sinatra was embarrassed to be apart of it."
2,Bach recording disappoints,Interesting Cantatas already recorded with much greater success by Gardiner. The Soprano has a fine voice although unsure and the Bass voice is inconsistent. The Countertenor has dreadful German diction and we have to wonder if he even knows what he is singing about (and the voice is unexceptional - maybe next time they will find a mezzo). The Tenor has the most promising voice. Aradia plays sensitively though the entire portrait of each Cantata is unclear.
4,A title that speaks for itself,"Like ""Oxeia"" and ""Teignmouth"", ""Mental Traveler"" gives exactly what LCTD fans expect. This is an album your lonely nights can't miss. If you like Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance and Love Spirals Downwards this is the right choice."
3,Buy the VH1 Behind the Music collection instead...,"There are literally dozens of John Denver collections out there. This one is among the best. However, the second disc is superfluous. If you're like me, all you want is a single disc collection with ALL the hits on it (the 2 & 3 CD collections are fine for die-hard fans). Your absolute best bet is the VH1 Behind the Music John Denver Collection (it came out in 2000). It is a single disc with ALL the hits, remastered. It includes the minor hit ""Friends With You"" (which is left off of most 2 & 3 disc collections). It has 18 tracks total and is all the John Denver most of us will ever need."
5,Late-comer to Denver,"I was just a kid when JD was really big in the 70's so I didn't come to really ""discover"" him until adulthood. Of course, I knew a lot of his songs but didn't really appreciate his greatness as an artist, singer and songwriter. Now being a fan of his, I see that he truly was a one-of-a-kind entertainer- and a great human being.This CD was a joy to me, as so many of John's gems were brand new to me. Many of his standards that I was familiar with, like 'Leaving On a Jet Plane', seemed so comforting and familiar, like an old friend. I highly recommend this CD to fans and non-fans alike. One listen will convert you to John's 'Rocky Mountain High'."
5,Great Tunes,Really like John Denver's music and have enjoyed listening to this album. A great voice lost in the clouds way too soon.
4,Definitive Denver,"I only chose ""like' because this type of CD is more of an ""in the right mood"" kind rather than one I would listen to any time and anywhere."
2,Not His Finest Work...,Contains some of his classics but not enough. Needs more of his upbeat material and less of the slow stuff.
4,Almost Heaven,This disc proves what a womderful writer and entertainer John was. Well worth adding to ypur collection.
5,"John Denver, All Time Greats","I did enjoy this tribute to John Denver. The lyrics are excellent, poetry actually. John's voice is not excellent but warm and charming, and the recordings are very good"
5,John Denver definative all time greatest hits,"This must be the best John Denver of all, it has the lot"
3,I could take it or leave it,"John Denver recorded some good songs which are on this album, such as ""Rocky Mountain High"" and ""Country Roads"". However, there are also some songs on this album that are not very good, such as songs he recorded late in his career."
2,Denver CD,"I love John Denver's music and this is a great CD of his best songs........however, when playing this CD I have to dial up the volumn to MAX to get just adequate sound. Very disappointed."
1,Dissatisfied,"I received this item with two bad songs on it that wouldnt play. Someone was kind enough to send a replacement which also was not as expected. On the second disc there are several songs in which there is a pulsating sound on it that is not part of the song. It's distracting but too much trouble to get into again. Bottom line, Im dissatisfied with both and dont use or play either. A bad experience for me."
5,Thanks for great service on an excellent product.,I love the John Denver cd. It has become one of my favorites.
4,"missing ""Goodbye Again""...","i checked the list of songs about five times to be sure and ""Goodbye Again"" which is probably my favorite JD song was not included...darn! seems like it must have been more of a hit than some of the included songs (several of which i have never heard of)"
2,Greatest Hits? You Must Be Kidding!,"There were a few good songs on this CD, but most were not good and in fact, quite boring and unenjoyable."
4,"Good, But Incomplete!","Where is: How can I Leave you Again,Love Again, Some Days are Diamonds, For Baby, Follow Me, Starwood in Aspen? There are certainly other fine songs, but the above are some of the finest! Hmm, maybe a John Denver ""Love Songs"" album is what's needed. Denver is too good to be left incomplete. However, I'm not surprised, BMG tends to be shallow when it comes to re-issues. They force you to buy other discs to complete a collection of hits. They should have taken the best of Vol.-1-2-3 and put in a 2-disc set. Those that own the 3 volumes would have bought it again just for the re-mastering, I know I would have."
3,Sensitive Techniques???,"The book presented a fundamental knowledge of an Intranet, which may be applied in the business world. The only thing Top Secret about the book was just the words on the cover which is a sales pitch."
2,Top Secret Intranet: Another Political Muse,"While Tom Martin's book lends an intriguing title to an intriguing subject, he has fallen prey to the political circles of the CIA and the US Intelligence Community as his book on Intelink misses the mark. While it is true that Intelink is an incredible phenomenon in the US Intelligence Community, the credit to its existence lies upon those workers in the Intelligence Community who desire and hard work created Intelink while those in the CIA and at the upper level of the Intelligence Community desperately try to tear it down."
1,20 bucks for a mediocre version of Frogger? Hmmm......,"Yeah, I bought this thing, as I am collecting as many of these TV games-things as I can. The version of Frogger on here is ok, at best, but it's certainly not emulation. For 20 bucks, and for only one game, I expected a near-perfect emulation (or at least a decent re-creation)of the original arcade game!As I've stated in my other reviews, I wish the people making these TV games would endeavor to make the emulation as close to the real thing as possible or just not bother. I often wonder if the people creating these TV-games even compared their work to the actual machine(s)!Yes, to those who've only casually played this game back in the day (and have never seen it emulated in MAME since then), a unit like this would probably give them some enjoyment. But, to anyone like myself, who has been playing these old coin-op games forever and even owns a few actual machines, many of these TV-game units have been disapointing, to say the least."
3,Great for Frogger addicts of yesteryear,"Yes, it only has ONE game. And it is said to be the same version as in one of the multi-game plug & plays, but this one holds its own nonetheless.It's a pretty true-to-form version of the Frogger of years past, and it remains a challenge because the more advanced levels (5+) are quite difficult. My wife loves it, my young children love it, and I enjoy picking it up every once in a while to reminisce. None of us would be considered ""gamers,"" but after growing during the golden age of video games, I find this product delightful."
5,Old time fun,"This game is just like I remember the arcade game. The graphics are great and it, like the other Plug n Play games, is extremely easy to use. The adults in our house like playing but can obviously get bored pretty easy but my 7 and 4 yr olds like it a lot. The four year old has quite learned how to get around the cars or navigate the river but occasionally he gets lucky. It's not really educational other than something along the lines of hand/eye coordination. The great thing is is that it easily plugs into the dvd player in the car - it doesn't take up much room and the cord is long enough to reach back to the third seat. I'm already in the market for more of these type games for long road trips."
1,"Fun game, badly done port, too much $.","Ok, first of all, the game itself is great, but this port stinks and it costs $20. $20 for a bad port?! The sound effects and music are completely different from the arcade version. If you want to play this game really badly, but have the same sound effects and music as the arcade version does, then I will suggest buying the arcade machine (If you have the money) or go search a little harder for a better version of this. If you like badly ported version of arcade games, this one is for you."
5,"the best 90""line up album","For me VROOOM sounds much better than Thrak and the best songs are here (without People of course).Just listen to Vrooom and One Time (longer than the Thrak version), and you will buy this Album. Of course, the live album B'Boom is a very good choice but not better than my 2 favourites : RED and Absent Lovers (6 stars rating). ps:excuse me for my poor english, it's a bit difficult"
3,Pffft,"Purists may reel in disgust, as the cerebrally metallic noodling can sound abrasively hollow, but this is still a decent enough EP holding at least a few moments of majesty amidst trying experimentation."
4,Better than the original,"It doesn't matter if you watched the original, Harvey Birdman takes all members of the Hanna Barbara family and brings them to modern maturity. Fred Flintstone as a mob boss, Inch High Private Eye discriminated at the work place. Classic concepts with adult humor that only the brains at Adult Swim could create.Not to mention one of the best theme songs!"
4,"Well-crafted and interesting works, well played","All of Ernst Toch's symphonies date from late in his career and are written in a gritty idiom, but despite being very chromatic they are definitely tonal. Alun Francis clearly has the measure of these works and are able to secure a strong melodic line. Both work are interestingly scored (including a Hammond organ and special effects in the third) and quite colorful. They are not, I think, in the end quite as good as the last three symphonies (presented on another disc in this series) - even though the third did win the Pulitzer price - but are ultimately very rewarding works nonetheless. Performances are, as indicated, very good indeed and sound quality is fine. For the adventurous this receives a strong recommendation."
4,Brighter,"The Maglite LMSA201 bulb was purchased for a 2D Maglite flashlight, is much brighter and whiter then the original Maglite bulbs.It also costs twice as much.Hopefully the promise of longer bulb and battery life is also true.Only 4 stars until bulb and battery life are tested."
5,Great upgrade lamp,I bought one of these to try out in one of my 6 cell maglites. This lamp is significantly brighter than the stock lamp. It's a whiter light too. The stock lamps have a yellowish tint to them. I'll definitely buy these lamps for all of my maglites.
4,Very Bright Bulbs,"Excellent bulb, better than the stock one that came with my maglight. I bought online because no one sells bulbs for the 6 cell version over the counter (at least that I could find).Items arrived in a timely fashion, shipping was abit high ($13+ for two bulbs) that fit in an envelope.I might check online using LMSA601 for another retailer with better shipping charges, but would buy from them again if I couldn't find something moderately cheaper."
3,Just gimme a 4-disc set with the WHOLE concert on it!,"Loved this movie of course, being that the musical acts are all so amazing; the immediacy of the show is great; the location is just quirky and brillant.And who couldn't love Dave.Although I'm proud to own this DVD, I won't watch it regularly as it just doesn't have enough complete songs on it.In real life it was like a 10-hour gig... come on Dave, give us a box set with 4 discs that shows the entire day, with every song in it's entirety!Then the current film would act like a ""Special Features"" disc, showing the making of.Just a thought.Still love it though, amazing concept, great true story against the odds, and brilliant musical performances by all."
3,To see another facet of Dave Chappelle,"This is not necessarily 'funny' but through all of Dave Chappelle's funniness, I have come to know and admire the man. This gives much insight into how he views the world and how he operates in the world. He is a hero to me, mostly because he has remained true to himself. He has not sold out, nor does it look like he ever could. Yay Dave!Other people assessed this accurately too--it would have been nice to have the special features with full, unedited versions of each performer."
3,Nice not amazing,"Its more a concert than a comedy video, I was specting more time on air by Chapelle, but the invited singuers are great one. Gotta love soul....."
4,"ITS NOT HALF BAKED! , It has message and mild humor","The movie was well done in INO.Dave was being dave expressing himself vocally on any topic. If you go into the movie, expecting chappelle show type stuff, or half baked comedy you will NOT be in for a treat.If you are a hip-hop fan this a great movie. The message that is brought in the movie is quite enlighting. Wyclef was a person who I enjoyed the most because of the little speech he gave to the children. "" basically his point was even you from the gutter and etc. DON""T be a victim make it happen. Fight for freedom.The musical performances were very good.thats itjubril.combusiness Phenom"
4,Dave Chappelle at his best,"WOW! what a great movie! Why did he have to leave comedy central! Still, Dave Chappelle is great!"
1,Horrible,"Dave Chappelle is a great stand up and had a great show. This movie is nothing like that. It is more like a 2 hour music video. If you like the bands in the movie, you will probably like this. If you dont, this is a horrible movie, I almost turned it off before it was done."
1,I'm sorry Dave Chapelle failed,"I think Dave Chapelle is one of the funniest men to have ever lived... this is a let down, a sad let down... sorry guys I dont have anything good to say. I bought it to be funny, and it is just not funny.... thats all there is to it."
4,For the true hip hop fans,"I went into this movie hoping to have a good Dave Chappelle laugh and enjoy some good music. What I got was a wonderful cross section of hip hop, from the lyricists to the musicians to the revolutionaries to the divas. The performances are genuine and as such are sometimes chaotic. Energy at such a high level doesn't always flow smoothly. But the performances show the lie that hip hop is all about sampling beats, violence and degradation of women. Dave is a great host, showing that he is a true entertainer while at the same time an ambassador to people of differing backgrounds. Lastly, the performances of Jill Scott, Erika Badu, and Lauren Hill brought this man to tears. Exceptional!"
5,Join the party now,"This is by far one of the best concert films out there, if you love hip hop its a must have."
5,Dave Chappelle at his best,Loved this movie when I saw it on HBO. Love it even more since I own it. I have watched it several times.
1,Typical Wackness,"how in the World that Dave Chappelle blew up in the first place is a real mystery?? so now that he choked a 50 Million Dollar pay day away he got smart&knows He doesn't deserve half the attention he has gotten in the first place. this is a Insult to Wattstaxx. that documentary from 1973 was important this is just a mess. the music Acts on here are lame as well. you want the Big Acts of today not no Milk carton, Has-beens or non-hit having acts. the only thing funny about this film is that it got made&was released. glad his corny show is no more. good riddence. this movie is equally bad as well."
4,Hidden Gems,"I had come across some of the earlier Stax material via Atlantic R&B record set years ago,including the unbelievable ""These Arms of Mine"" by Otis R.I was inspired by a recent excellent 2 hour TV doco.about Stax to chase up this 98 track collection.Certainly some of the tracks have not stood up well over years but, along with the expected quality tracks from Otis R. and Sam and Dave, I did find several gems I would not have known b4, especially a Mel and Tim track and Albert King`s rendition of a great Etta James song.I also bought the DVD of the Stax Live show in Norway 1967, which was strongly covered in the TV Doco. and is an excellent companion to this CD set."
1,Home-made recording at home!?,"Dreadful, dreadful... just dreadful. Despite the superbly interesting programme, the performance is dull, and uninspired. The recording quality sounds as if you just placed two Radio-Shack microphones in each of the pianos, recorded on a portable, cassette Walkman. The instruments used in the recording may be Steinways, but it is doubtful that quality instruments were used. The entire album sounds like they were recorded on old, unmaintained baby grands, probably model M, instead of finer, larger instruments. The acoustic environment resembles a small, carpetted living room where no reverberation could possibly take place. The sense of harsh, mediocre sound as if my head is stuck in the pianos, with the uninspired performance of these magnificent work is an impressive display of misguided amateurism that deserves to be confined to the same living room where the recording was probalby made."
3,"Good picture, lacks details in dark areas","I've owned this TV for couple of months now. The first TV I bought had 7 dead pixel, so called up syntax and they were happy to replace the TV (though it took them 4 weeks to send the replacement). The new(replacement) one had no pixel issues. The picture quality is great for HD signals and standard defenition picture (my cable box upconverts everything to 1080i) is much better than my regular TV. But the dark areas in the Picture lacks detail. I tried to play around with the TV settings, but no improvement yet. I guess that's the inherent disadvantage of the flat panels. You may want to shell out a lil more and get a nicer flat panel if you want more details in black. But for the price I paid i am ok with the quality of the picture."
2,Save your money for something better,"As usual, I buy something the impress the Mrs, and end up apologizing for not letting her see it before I buy it, although I attempted to explain that the stores are showing the TV's running special DVD's for display, and not local broadcasts.I replaced my 14 year old 27"" JVC CRT TV with this LCD and what a dissapointment. When playing DVD's thru the DVI connection it looks great (so would any TV), but the regular broadcasts are terrible. Factory defaults are bland and bright. If you turn down the brightness, skin color turns either a sharp pink, or the opposite, a sallow yellow. No happy medium.Same goes for the aspect ratio. It really only looks fairly decent when you set it to 4:3 and takes the ""stretching"" effect out.This will probably end up as a ""very expensive"" computer monitor since watching TV is uncomfortable, or on EBAY."
1,BEWARE! Syntax Warranties!,"Syntax clearly states that their warranty is only good for the origninal purchaser. I got my daughter one as a gift, gave it to her bran new, in the factory sealed box and Syntax refuses to honor the warranty, (and yes I calld everywere and tried everything)."
1,Voice-It VT-300,"Awful. Owned (and lost) an earlier version of the Voice It product line, and this is pretty much inferior in every way. Vocal quality is bad at any speed. No matter, since the buttons seem to have deteriorated to the point where I can't record anything anyway. All I get is three beeps - no action. Evidently, the manufacturer hates it too. Called the customer support number on the back of the unit and all you get is a recording saying they no longer support the Voice It line. Avoid like Katrina backwash."
1,VXI ruined a great thing,"I faithfully carried a Voice-It in my shirt pocket from 1994 to 1999. In the beginning, the line was owned by a small company in Fort Collins, Colorado--where I lived at the time. One day I left my Voice-It in my pocket in the laundry. I took it to the Voice-It office, and they repaired it--no questions asked.Forward 3 years. I purchased another unit just after VXI began remarketing them. It stopped working within 2 months. Customer support recommended a reset process, which worked for a few days-then it stopped working again. I was then unable to speak with anyone at VXI--the CSR's couldn't do anything more, and the supervisor never returned by call. Bad customer service--and now they've lost a customer."
3,"Worked for my needs, but flawed","As a songwriter/general idea person -- one with a terrible memory -- this was a great little machine. Simple (I don't need multiple folders or shuffle play) and really small. However, like all the VoiceIt models, it has one major flaw, and that is that the buttons protrude -- they stick out. This means that keys in your pocket or the side of a desk you lean against can press the ""play"" button, and it's very embarrassing when your pocket starts talking! Worse, on more than one occasion, the ""erase all"" button was pressed and I lost everything. It doesn't take a genius to see this is a bad design, but these guys turned out several models with the same problems. I recommend against any brand that has a protruding ""erase"" button."
2,"Nice Product, Poor Quality Control","I, too, upgraded from the VT-90 to the VT-300 for the extra time capacity. I also prefer not having to shop for foolish watch battery sizes. Standard AAA's are MUCH easier to find and last a lot longer. A volume control would be nice, since playback is loud, and that sucks battery life fast! Talking quieter into the unit improves the loudness, but fidelity fades along with it.BUT -- my biggest gripe is the cheap buttons. They gradually deteriorated over time, either failing to connect or bouncing (start-and-stop recording immediately), missing the recording repeatedly. Now, I can't even get it to operate 1 time out of 30 button presses.The BEST feature is how compact it is. Nobody else has one that even comes close in size. Too bad they didn't design a better keypad."
5,"High Quality, quick delivery",The product was delivered in a timely manner. It is of high quality. It is the first time I have owned a pudding mold and I was impressed.
4,Dancey industrial,"The tunes on this disc are consistently catchy, moody, and incredibly danceable. Blood is a classic in clubs. One drawback is that most of the songs sound very similar; the instrumentation and whispered vocals give them a sameness."
4,Sounds Like Front Line Assembly,"As the Title Reads, This Album Definatly Sounds like FLA in some ways, Some of the vocals and some of the guitar work. It Sounds really different from ""Blood Meridian"". The Vocals just aren't the same. Don't Buy Blood Meridian if you end up liking this album. I like the tracks Effigy, and Driven the most. Over all it's a pretty [cool]Cd and if your into industrial in any way at all You'll probably like this."
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,"What a great performance! Everybody in the show did there utmost to pay tribute to the late great Carl Perkins. Carl himself was an outstanding showman and singer and this DVD/CD proves it with out a doubt.Suppossedly, there is a bio-pic coming out in 2009 about his life. I hope the can re-create parts of this special with dead on accuracy as some of the greatest musicans in the world were featured along with Carl.I strongly recommend this DVD! Whether you like Carl Perkins or not, your going to like this."
2,Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session,"The music performances here are first-rate, as is the cool factor of having all these incredible artists paying tribute to one of the greats who helped form their musical identities. The sound is mostly first-rate as well, marred only by some muddy-sounding drums and some vocals that could be louder.But what caused me to give this two stars is the video quality, which was obviously copied from somebody's VHS tape. And not even a first generation copy. Simply put, the video quality is awful. This artist (Carl Perkins) and his guests deserve a whole lot more respect than they were given here by the greedy bastard who couldn't or wouldn't secure the rights to the original tapes. I can't believe no one commented on this in their reviews. Had I known, I wouldn't have spent my money on this travesty."
1,dvd,this DVD did not work in any DVD play i have opend it late and was unable to return im sure it was a good time with George and friends becareful
4,A LP of COVERS and a few originals...,"A LP of COVERS and a few originals...Very nice.. my favz are ""Godstar"",a cover of PSYCHIC TV song ""Love Changes Everything"" ""TV on In Bed"" ""Jennifer, Julie, & Josefine"" ""Don't Cry Baby.."" ""Isn't It A Pity"""
4,This is my first camcorder and I'm very pleased!,"I got this one because of the name & the price. The LCD screen is really nice, perfect picture. All I do is make home movies with it, so I'm not really into all the editing stuff. I have taken a few pictures, and the quality is really grainy. But the way I look at it, the video quality is great, and that's why I bought it. The menu is a little overwhelming, and I still don't know what most of the menu items do. I'm learning as I go. Overall, though, I would probably buy this item again."
3,software (and its support) is poor,"Cant figure out the software (""Picture Package"") that comes with the camcorder.The only way to get video from the camcorder through Firewire interface, seems to be to use the ""Automatic Video Producer"" feature of ""Picture Package"".To do such a video capture, it forces you to choose a value for the options ""Music settings"" (for sound) and ""Effect/Style"" (for video). There is NO WAY not to choose a value for these options !! So whatever video you download has these stupid effects :( I managed to get rid of the ""Music settings"" by going to the installation folder and physically removing the .mp3 file it was using for the sound effects. But I cannot find a way to get rid of the video effects ..Sony support was not helpful."
1,No good product,"Used to be a loyal sony customer as all me previous products were close to invincible. So I went out of my way to purchase a sony for my first camcorder. Took it home and turned it on... then it died on me. Yep right there and then, no abuse nothing, just died on me. The customer service apologized but didn't do much. To me I cannot fathom how sony is staying in business (i wish I read these reviews here first before I made my decision, as obviously they are going on a downhill trend as far as quality is concerned) with kind of quality. I will never buy another sony product again and will make sure no friends of mine make that mistake.DON'T BUY!!"
2,disappointing,"web cam is awful, still pics are very low quality. doesn't have built in flash. only burns to vaio's and awful softward."
5,Excelente compra,"Una excelente cámara, de tamaño compacto y muy liviana, posee una imagen nitida y un sonido claro (podría decir de calidad profecional) El nightshot plus excelente más que comparable con un visor de visión noctura. El software es fácil de instalar, no se necesita ser un profecional para lograrlo, es sólo intuición y leer con detenimiento el manual, los efectos digitales están geniales. Es muy silenciosa, la duración de la batería es buena, el zoom óptico es un poco deficiente 10x pero por el tamaño y las demás especificaciones este detalle es facilmente ignorable."
2,medium quality,"In short, this is a medium quality camcorder. The picture quality is not great, the recorder is picking up the motor noise and still images are completely useless.The AUTO mode takes the picture or video very dark. You need to adjust the exposure for better picture or video.You cannot do anything about the recorded motor noise. it is always thereYou cannot print the still images taken with this camcorder (even in 4x6). So if you buy this for the still image,dont wasteyour money and choose with better or theonew/o still pictures.The features are very limited per the canon zseriesof camcorders. Optical zoom is 10x, which is very limited in compare to 20x (Canon)The software works but the VCD creation is very slow with the provided SW.So in short, this camcorder does not deserve what is costs."
2,Sony Camcorder,Do not buy this camara.It looks atractive but it has big problems with the LCD becoming blank when you are about to recored.There is a big class action against Sony.A lot of people have these problems with this camara including me.
1,Don't buy Sony DCR-HC30,"DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA. Many Sony Camcorders that incorporate an image sensor device, CCD Chip, manufactured from October 2002 through March 2004 may exhibit the following condition:When the Camcorder is used in camera mode, the LCD panel and/or electronic viewfinder will show either a distorted image or no image. You also might get a message that COVER is not OPENSony has elected to offer a free repair to the owners of applicable Camcorders if the image sensor device, CCD chip, causes one of the above-mentioned conditions. WHEN I CALLED CUSTOMER SUPPORT, THEY TOLD ME THAT I HAVE TO PAY AT LEAST 170 to get this fixed. This is ridiculous since it's a known defect, but apparently the recall period has ended in March. DON't buy this camcorder."
3,Wrong Item sent,Item listed on Amazon was not the item received. Returned the item and received a full refund. No hassle other than having to mail the item back.
4,Great camera for the college student,"I just bought this camcorder yesterday, but the 24 hours that I've spent going through its features and video quality, I must say that I'm fairly impressed. I know it's not at the top of the food chain, but the picture/sound quality is what I expected it to be for its class. I'm happy with the feature set; especially the 16:9 ratio mode and the spot focus/exposure setting. I could go on about this camcorder, but lets hear what others have to say. I sorta splurged, considering I'm a college student.. but I feel my investment was well worth it."
2,Cassette won't eject,"I used this item only 6 or 7 times and the cassette will not eject. Sony will only fix this poor-quality product if I pay them $211. Awful quality, crappy service."
4,Fear In The North Woods,"I really liked the setting of this story in Northern Maine. The characters are as ruggged as the environment in which they live and who is better to solve these countless murders than a retired cop from NYC, Charlie Parker. Charlie has a lot of help from his friends, Louis and Angel.This story was very good, a real attention grabber once you got into it; it has it's ghosts, fear, suspense, murder, and terror. It has a lot of supernatural events and ghostly dreams throughout. It was hard for me to put everthing together in the beginning, but a little patience paid off and this was a very good and fast read that kept me on the edge of my seat.This will be a series that I will certainly read more of."
5,My favorite author!,"I loved the second ""Bird"" Parker novel, and actually ordered a British copy off the Internet to be able to read it earlier. A note to fans; I have found that the British edition includes a few scenes in their completion, which appear to have been trimmed in the American version. Perhaps editors felt the swimming pool scene was too intense for frail American readers.Anyway, I thoroughly enjoy Connolly's books. The touch of the supernatural is more present here than in his first novel, and Connolly makes that atmosphere work well for him.Grab any book of his that you can find!"
3,Stick with it...the series gets better.,"I have begun working though the entire backlist of John Connolly. I read book 11 of the series and absolutely loved it. Book one was a rambling mess that really should have been two books at a minimum. Here with book two Connolly has narrowed down his plot to tell one story instead of many, but it really is a little too wandering to get there. Essentially this book could have used a lot more tightening to tell the story in much less time.So it is great strides over book one, but nowhere near the quality of book eleven. That is good though because I am getting a lot of back-story of the characters I was missing before. Plus I love the built in guarantee that each book I read is just going to be better than the last one. Jon Connolly is a writer who has mastered his craft through hard work. Work that we get to enjoy.So read this book to understand the characters and stick with the writer knowing your reward is coming.Thanks T Steven for this review"
3,2 1/2 Stars -- Lots Of Action but Dark Hollow Left Me With a Dark Hollow Sense Of Satisfaction!,"Having enjoyed Every Dead Thing as well as The White Road, I was somewhat disappointed in this sequel to Every Dead Thing. The characters were not particularly interesting nor especially well developed. Further, while Dark Hollow provides more than the average amount of action in a thriller, my overall feeling was that I didn't care enough about most of the characters to care one way or the other about what happens to them. Further, the action scenes were somewhat predictable. Unlike my two previous positive experiences with Connolly's books -- which stood out from the pack for their rich imagery and complex and interesting plotting, Dark Hollow didn't work for me."
2,"Oh Please - Another Alcoholic, Guilt-Wracked, Knight in Shining Armour","I picked this up at my local mystery bookstore, never having read John Connolly before. I probably never will again. The book started out promisingly enough, but it could have used a heavy editor's pen to get rid of a few of the too many villains and to lighten up a little on the purple prose. Connolly really comes across as a second rate James Lee Burke. Burke writes the same book over and over, but at least it's a good book. Connolly's dialogue does not ring true and the characters are paper thin. The vicious mobsters; the racist backwoods deputy; the hitman/sidekick with a heart of gold - not one character seemed to possess a shred of believability. I found myself literally skimming through the last hundred pages just to get to the end, with its obligatory bloodbath. Nothing new at all."
1,Dull-dull-dull,"As an action mystery writer, Connolly is slow and dull. If you would like to read 60 pages of historical background on small New England townships before getting to any intrigue, this is the book for you--Truly, the book is 50% description of historical data or environmental and neighborhood description--but no action for a mystery buff."
1,An extremely bad experience. Please go elsewhere.,No dust jacket provided and this book was listed in very good condition. I would expect this situation to occur at a yard sale.
3,Confusing,"I am probably the only reviewer who rates this novel with 3-stars. I found it very confusing, as I did his previous book, with too many superficial characters and too much ""bloody"" action. Now, if ""goor"" is ""your thing"" then this is a book for you. The author never really develops his main characters which to me is a major flaw. I found it hard to concentrate on who was killing who.. Enough said!"
4,Complicated but fun read.,"This is a little more work for the reader than most stories of this type. The plot involves history, intrigue, and modern myths."
4,Very well written,"Connolly truly as a way with words and he is at the top of his genre with his second novel. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it did not seem to grab me as much and hold my attention as well as Every Dead Thing, but it was still great and I have the 3rd book ready to be read."
5,2.5 Year Old Twins Love Blue and This Video,"My 2.5 year old twins really enjoy this Blue's Clues video. We have a massive collection of videos and this one has become one of their favorites. Steve, Blue and all their friends have really helped my two toddlers learn new words and actions. It's great for all of us."
4,Helped my son's speech,"My 4 year old was diagnosed with High Functioning Autism PDD-NOS, and has a speech delay. I checked this video out from the library, and my son LOVED it. He actually learned the ""Hey Diddle Diddle"" nursery rhyme from it! I've been able to build upon it and help his speech, as well. It's one of the earlier Blue's Clues, but what stood out to me was how it seemed to click with my son."
5,Blue's Clues is the BEST!,"My two year old son adores Steve and Blue. This tape breaks familiar stories down into ""clues"" for the kids to figure out. My little one never gets tired of it and as a parent I appreciate it because children have to THINK to solve the puzzle.I reccomend Blue's Clues to anyone who has young children and has grown tired of the ""old standby"" shows that they usually watch."
5,Seen this about 500 times now.,"I can't say enough about this video. My son inherited it from his 6 yr. old cousin who has know outgrown Blue and Steve. He wants to watch this every day! every night! It is his favorite next to Winnie the Pooh.Even though this video came out a few years ago, Blue's Clues still seems to be in the loop for toddler entertainment.My son is 18 months and totally adores this. Even though he can't completely follow everything, it is still very good at helping him acquire learning skills. He is already repeating a lot of the words that he hears, and gets his hips shaking along with Steve's.Fun music, animation, and dancing...highly recommend this one!!Eileen Famiglietti"
4,Bright Light,"Spare bulbs for the back side of my re=chargeable Mag Lights.Take a pretty good amount of punishment without blowing.Just use caution, as with any halogen bulb, when installing to not actually touch the bulb with your fingers. Use a tissue so that the oil from your skin does not shorten the bulb life. Excellent product, especially when used in the 12 volt / vehicle rechargeable Mag Light."
5,Improvement For Sure!,"These bulbs are an improvement for sure, simply because when you dropped a Mag Lite Rechargeable Flashlight on a hard surface like concrete with the old bulbs, they would suddenly shine brighter for a period of time then burn out. Haven't had that happen? Your lucky then. For the rest of us, we know all to well what dropping a Mag Lite Rechargeable Flashlight would do to the bulbs. These newer ones are a bit more forgiving. So far I've dropped my Mag Lite on concrete four times while working on cars with the newer bulbs and haven't had a burn out yet! I don't know what to say about the other reviews? I'll settle for a little less light anytime - for a more durable bulb!"
2,Risky packing,The bulbs came fast but were packed in a box with a book with no packing material. No way to know if they are damaged until it's time to use them.
2,Short life,Bulbs only last about a month with daily use. We use this light to walk the dog every night. On our third bulb since holloween. Well right after writing this review I checked my light and now we are on our fourth bulb. So they burn out in under a month. Ill have to just throw this light out when I run out of bulbs because I can't afford them at this rate.
4,Works well but heats up quite a bit,"I purchased this as a replacement bulb for my mini maglite. Overall, I'm pleased with it, but give it only 4 stars due to it heating up so much. My original light did not get very hot at all. This one heats up quickly and is quite hot. Seems to work well though and is nice and bright."
1,Xenon bulbs are worthless,"After purchasing the mini mag light, I was excited to see such a bright beam out of a tiny flashlight. After about 40 minutes of use, however, the xenon lamp burned out. I figured it was maybe bad from the factory, so I purchased replacements. These, too, burned out after about 30 minutes of use. Avoid the xenon bulbs at all costs."
5,It really works,"I have a bunch of the mini mag flashlights for the Girl Scouts, so when one stopped working I was bummed that I had to buy a new one. I never knew you could buy replacement bulbs for these things - WAY cheaper and less wasteful to just buy a bulb. Now I have one bulb to spare. A couple of dollars for two bulbs vs $10 for a new flashlight. Free shipping with Amazon Prime and I avoid the stores!"
4,good replacement,i give this item a good solid 4 star since its only a lamp replacement. if it was a product could be a 5 star.
5,As advertised,Great replacement bulb for the maglite flashlight. Shipped along with other items without additional cost! Plug and play ready from the get go.
3,Last time I will ever use 1-click checkout...,"Bulbs are fine and I love the Mag light line. But if I looked at the price I would pay to have this ""mailed"" to me I would have waited till I got into town again rather than 'click' ... Amazon please don't even try to justify the shipping charge with the padded mailer. If this item is part of a larger order, go for it! But I just picked up same bulb set plus a new flash light and a belt holster with batteries included for less than I paid in total for these two bulbs... Feeling burned."
5,yes they work,"My bulb burnt on my AA battery smaller maglight, and these are the replacements. Be gentle during the replacement,a nd it will all turn out fine, a very nice product."
1,All 4 bad?,"I'm not sure if it was just coincidence, but I ordered 2 packs of these for my flashlight when I was over in Afghanistan.Not one of these bulbs lasted more than a month in my flashlight. They all kept burning out. The worst part is I didn't use my flashlight THAT often. On most forward operating bases there's white light discipline during the night. This means you have to use red or blue light only (harder to see off in the distance). So when I was using my maglight it was when I was behind a server rack or in my room or some situations like that.These bulbs burnt out left and right. Horrible quality. I regret buying these and I'm hoping that if you're reading this you look elsewhere for replacement bulbs."
3,"Great bulbs, but nothing beats LED","These bulbs can run for five hours on two AAs, they last about three months of good use before burning out. This is very good compared to some flashlights, espcially since most cheap flashlights don't allow bulb replacement like the Mag. But for eight dollars, you can get a Nite Ize LED adapter for the AA Mini Mag that gives you twenty hours of light off those same batteries and literally a hundred thousand hours of bulb life. Save yourself the money on bulbs and batteries, pick up an LED, you'll never have to hunt online for bulbs again. Yes, it's a great flashlight and bulb. But for the price of four of these, you'll never have to buy another set of bulbs again, and and top of that you'll save handfuls of cash on batteries. Even if you just need an emergency flashlight, four times the battery life and unlimited bulb life isn't exactly shabby during a power outage."
5,Xenon is much brighter than stock bulb!,"I ordered these replacement bulbs and was pleasantly surprised to receive Xenon bulbs; based on the main product picture, I was just expecting stock bulbs. I replaced the bulb in my Mini Mag and was again pleasantly surprised to see the difference in brightness! The Xenon bulbs are much brighter, and even slightly smaller. I have always preferred incandescent bulbs to LEDs. This flashlight has been going strong for over 20 years, and I expect it to last another 20 at least. $1.25 for a bulb that lasts 10+ years of occasional use? Good enough for me."
5,TRACKS ARE...,1. Raining2. Dance3. Baragnini4. Mafola5. Illusion6. Fire on the Mountain7. Fire Boat8. Keneya9. Illusion10. Fire Boat
2,Too much is...too much,"Okay, I confess I'm still plowing my way through this book. I'm on page 157, I think, and while the bodies were revealed way up front, everything else I've read thus far is Cissie being Cissie and Andy being dumber than a brick. A little of this mother-daughter dynamic went a long way in the first book, but this time it's simply over the top. As humor, it falls flat. As a mystery, it's *what* mystery? Maybe the second half of the book will pick up the pace a little, but getting there is a challenge I'm not certain I'm willing to take."
2,the lone star lonely hearts club,Disappointing. Our heroine spends 300 pages convinced her mother (as sane as any wealthy Texas matron) is crazy. Not believable even in the pretend world. I was looking forward to this third outing of Ms. Kendricks but had to keep reading faster to not put it down completely. Surely #4 will be back on track.
4,Incredible Features for a Budget Amp,"This amp replaced a ten-year-old Technics Pro-Logic amp that served me well but died suddenly.The 6.1 channels of 100 watts each deliver a much smoother and clearer sound in my Olson and Technics speakers than the old amp did. Music and movies sound better than I have ever heard in my family room. Other than special releases, I have no reason now to set foot in a movie theatre.The DSP features are plentiful enough for the average user; after all, who needs 11 different presets just to listen to 2-channel stereo recordings? The three different presets for music are more than enough, as are the three sets for movies. There are also plenty of matrix surround schemes to choose from: ProLogic, ProLogic II Movie, ProLogic II Music, DTS Neo:6 Cinema and Music.The only drawback to this amp is that it does not have a phono input. I highly recommend the STR-DE597, especially for the price."
2,Surprisingly poor sound,"I purchased this receiver in order to obtain optical inputs so I could plug my Apple Airport with Airtunes in and listen to music from my computer. My previous receiver was a Sony STRGX47ES, which I have been happy with. I didn't want all the bells and whistles of the higher-end receivers and assumed the sound would be fine. Boy was I wrong. I plugged it in to my Paradigm Mini Monitors (which I highly recommend!) and the sound was unbelievably poor, direct from a CD. Even my wife, who normally does not notice these things, agreed that the sound was drastically worse than with our old receiver. I promptly boxed it back up to return and have since ""inherited"" an STR-DE1015G from an uncle, and the sound is easily as good as my old ES model, plus it has the optical inputs."
5,EXCELLENT CD,"This cd is excellent. The song ""Someone's Child"" is another example of why Gene Watson is one of the best country artists singing today."
2,relatively mean-spirited,"We own all the Land Before Time videos, and I was disappointed in this one. Although the tiny dinosaurs are cute (and so is Cera's dad's girlfriend), the characters are either mean-spirited, dumb or ineffectual. Littlefoot and Cera are shown to be spiteful, Cera's dad is a raging, lying bully and Grampa has regressed from being a wise elder to being a weak and ignored character. The plot: Littlefoot feels inadequate for being short so he tries to eat the tree blossoms that Cera's dad guards fiercely. The tiny dinos come and eat what Littlefoot knocks down, Littlefoot lies to protect himself and Cera's dad organizes a posse to hunt and kill the little ones. The songs include references to eliminating others, how bad dads are, and other choice themes I'd rather not sing aloud with my 5 year old son. This is by far the worst of the lot."
2,For Kids - I Guess - Really Little Kids,"This movie has obviously been written for prescholars, since the villains are real cheap, and there's no excitement, and way too many songs. Still, pretty harsh for kids, since song lyrics include, ""Everybody hates those little creepy crawlies,"" ""Dads can be a problem,"" and ""Stupid stompers!"" The movie is pretty much way too smooth-flowing, with no real struggles. Littlefoot tells a lie, and puts the tiny ones in danger. We've all seen this before. Get this for an open-minded kid who knows that what they watch isn't always the truth. If you ask me, get this for a toddler, but no older."
5,Sarah loves it!,"Our daughter is 22 months old and absolutely LOVES this movie! We don't own any of the others in the series, but will be picking them up one at a time soon I'm sure. I didn't expect her to enjoy dinosaurs at her age (I thought she might even be afraid of them), but she has requested this movie every day since we first played it two weeks ago. She enjoys the songs and focuses on the action all the way through. One of her favorite parts is toward the end when a couple of meat-eating dinos show up and threaten the main characters. She sees the bad guys and exclaims ""Teeth!"" and cheers when they are eventually chased off. Hard to say how this movie will hold up as she gets older, but for now, it's definitely a favorite!Trivia: It was an interesting surprise to find out that the grandfather in this film is voiced by Kenneth Mars, the Inspector from ""Young Frankenstein"". I kept waiting for him to shout ""To the lumberyard!"" Apparently, he's in most of the movies in this series."
2,Not what you expected..By The Z,"This one was not horrible except for the new addition of Littlefoots voice. Another thing, Aria and Jeff need voice lessons Badly! Their reprise of ""Creepy Crawlies"" was horrible. The semi-plot wasn't the smartest thing to do but Tria has a pretty good singing voice. With the addition of Skitter, Lizzie, and Big Daddy made a cool impression, ""Girls and Dads"" was the only impressive thing in the DVD. Cera's dad though is really starting to get on my nerves. He is getting really mean to Cera and it kind messed up the story line. Littlefoot's song: ""If Only"" was really good because it was sort of a confession why he lied and that proves that if you lie, it will only get worst. Most importantly though, The Land Before Time 12: The Day of the Flyers should be pretty interesting. The date of arrival is TBA. I hope that the sequel is better than this.."
1,WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!?,"I have asked them once and I'll say it again: Stop. This is one crappy series and nobody loves it anymore. Bad songs, freaky subplot, and a two thumbs down episode. If this stupid company ever makes another crappy story again, I'm just going to sue the company."
3,I WOULDNT BUY IT FOR SOMEONE OVER 10,"First of all i just turned 14 and i used to watch these movies a LONG time ago. But i would buy it for a young child tho. I think these movies suck now but hey im not going to rate it bad because its a childrens movie. Personally i like action, comedy horror movies. But this movie is an OK film but i would recommend for a young child only"
1,Just get a disney movie,"The series suck. It's only good for kids, but older audience will be pissed to sit and watch the whole thing. Disney movies are better to watch with your kids. I enjoy watching Disney movies even teenager. At least the adults can enjoy the movie too."
1,THE WORST EVER MADE!,"I havn't even seen this and this looks like a waste of time. Sure the those tiny creatures look cute, but this is deffinately for toddlers and under."
1,boring,ok this is getting to be real annoying all they do is keep doing this dumb series and wont stop i saw the first one and never wanted to see it again ha if your kid wants it you should not get it because they will stop liking it in a year or so and you spent all that money for nothing! the person who created it just brain washes kids to get this movie and make there parents buy it so parents do not buy this.
2,not as good as the rest,"i enjoyed this, but the songs are not very good(Except for ""if only""). also the sub-plot is silly. so buy this if you are a land before time fan, but know that you might be disappointed. i have a good idea for the series..."
1,"""Kids VS Parents""?","The reviewers ""B&B; Brothers Motorplant"" say ""all [that this movie] is showing our children is that it is okay to disrespect their father. Besides, according to the movie, Dad's just don't get it anyways.""""Dad's [incorrect use of possessive] just don't get it anyways [incorrect use of plural].""The movie is trying to give its young viewers the strength not to disrespect their parents, but to try to set them right when they're wrong about something. Parents can be as wrong as kids, you know; here in terms of spelling, but in other ways too (my own parents are glad to admit when they're wrong sometimes).The movie is still awful, but only because the animation is bad, the drawing is ugly, and Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse are funnier."
4,good movie,"a fun movie to watch, i only rate it four stars due to the high standard set by vol one of the set."
4,Land Before Time XI,"After buying the first one, we had to buy every volume that came out. My grandson loved it and the animation was very cute."
4,Good show with solid message for kids,"This is a good Land Before Time show. Looked amazing on a BluRay player. Excellent sound, songs, and message. Would like to see better games/bonus features...this isn't a $5 movie, kids love simple games and these movies need to up the ante on bonus features."
2,What is this?,"I have to admit, after seeing the 8th one, the movies started to get BAD!!!!!!!I do have to admit this was better then I expected it. Great animation, but a poor story line. Tria was pretty cool. I also thought that was cute when Cera and one of the other tiny dinos had stuff in common.Some of those songs had to go! The only one I really liked was ""Dads and Daughters"". Cuz, you know what it has some truth to it. (I hope I'm not just speaking for myself!)Ducky and Petrie were totally out of character, and Spike, was well, the same. I still like these guys, but the next one HAS to be better then this."
3,mr potatoe head,"been such a long time since i bought this, cant remember, but probably good though. i forgot to submit it"
4,Multimedia presentation of a classic Broadway Show,"Comden and Green, sitting on stools, narrate their hit Broadway show, ""on The Town."" Tyne Daly, David Garrison, etc., show up and sing the songs between the narration and the use of documentary footage of New York City in the 1940's. A very imaginative show, which was shown on PBS during their fund-raising drive."
3,Not Good,It wasn't what I thought and the customer service is not responsive. I don't recommend it but it might work for other people!
1,hankt,"The brightness of it is terrible. It is easy to connect to flash light, but we were looking for something very bright for the maglite."
2,Not product pictured,"I ordered this lamp as a replacement for a Cyclops bulb. The picture made it appear to be the correct bulb. When it came in, it looked NOTHING like the bulb in the product page. Instead it is a retrofit replacement for the bulb pictured. This is totally useless to me."
1,"Not as pictured, not usable.","Replacement lamp for C &D; 4-Cell Flashlights. Great just what I want! What this actually is, is a retrofit, consisting of a base, a collar and a different style Xenon bulb. This would be great if the lamp being replaced/upgraded was a Maglite brand flashlight. My Streamlight brand flashlight uses the Maglite bulb, but is not compatible with this retrofit (the replacement collar is a larger diameter).Due to the low price of the item I had to purchase several more than I needed to meet the minimum purchase amount. Had this item been correctly listed as a retrofit kit instead of being pictured as a replacement lamp bulb, i would have continued shopping for a direct replacement. I have since found a local source for the original lamp."
2,not,this was a very boering movie to drawn out but chidren might like it though most loose interest quickly thats it
5,I loved it,This was very interesting and held my attention all the way to the end. I end joyed the story line and the animation very must. Thank you
3,Felt completely forced,"This was 45 minutes of story and concept at most. The rest of the movie was filled with cute little things you've come to expect in animated movies. The problem was, they felt forced. I liked the movie, and I liked the voice acting. The way the movie filled out just didn't work for me. The musical numbers seemed like they happened because it was ""time for a song"" and there needs to be a soundtrack to sell. Two examples that I think worked came to mind when this movie was over: 1) Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs probably had less of a story to work with, but the movie was filled out in a more coherent way. 2) The Little Mermaid had musical numbers that brought you into the story and advanced it. The songs didn't pop out like unrelated music videos in the middle of the movie. Those comparisons may mean nothing to you - and probably even LESS to your children! - but I make them to explain my 3-star rating. ""It's OK"""
1,Great Book....Horrible movie,"I loved reading this book to my daughter. I loved its message of nature's beauty, bounty, and importance, along with each individual's responsibility to do their part to maintain it. The movie, on the other hand was filled with frenetic noise, pointless activity, an emphasis on evil bad-guys instead of personal responsibility for lack of long-range planning. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I wish I could apologize personally to Dr. Seuss for watching this degrading version of his wonderful book."
2,"The Kids Liked It, But...","My kids like the movie just fine. The younger one said it was ""good"" and the older said it was ""okay"". I couldn't even make it through to the end."
2,"Great Movie, poor streaming!","The movie itself was good, but I ordered the HD version and that is not what I received. The imagery was very grainy and at times froze. I don't know if I would go with HD agin through streaming. Movie was good though."
3,"My kids loved it, but...","I'm not sure why, but my kids love this movie and have watched it a gazillion times since Christmas. They have a good chunk of the dialog and music memorized. I'm sure the constant repetition of the movie and my children's re-enactment of the movie isn't helping. But honestly, I don't care for children's movies that are nothing more than propaganda. Had I read the book first, I would have expected that though."
5,lorax lover,We (the whole family) enjoyed it in the theater and now get to watch when ever we like. The boys watched it over and over for the first few days.
4,Great kids movie,This was a great purchase for my niece for Christmas! She was excited! Great purchase! I would recommend this item.
1,animation with an agenda,"This animated ""kids"" film was built around an environmental awareness agenda. Painting capitalism as the ruthless disregarding anything and everything in their path. Most IMAX films have a similar slant, I just hope this isn't the new norm of animation films.Make a factual film and let your views determine truth instead of cramming this garbage down our throats..."
3,good movie,"Enjoyed the story in this movie. I don't care much for the music, but it is funny. Kids love it"
5,Great laughs,My kids loved this movie. Didn't see it at the theater and now wish we did. Very funny and well done.
5,My Kid loves it.,My kid loves all Dr.Seuss stories and cartoons. I bought this a gift for him. Even we loved watching along with him. He watches this atleast once a week. Very good movie with a message.
4,LORAX Digital Download,"I bought the 3D movie from Best Buy. A digital download, included with purchase, allowed me to get for free a download directly to my computer, or Amazon On Demand.Unfortunately the credit given to purchase from Amazon was only for the SD version. I wish they would have given me an HD version for my TV. No comparison to my blu-ray version, although it is still watchable. On a mobile or handheld player this would have been adequate, but sometimes I don't have access to my blu-ray copy, so an HD version in the cloud would have been nice.Amazon, if you are reading this, could you set me up with the HD version for my Amazon library?"
1,Stupidly Political,"Cute is fine. There were some funny parts with the kid's mom and Disco music. But the commentary on the EVIL corporations was pathetic as if governments were never EVIL or rapacious of the land. Just look at Eastern Europe's environment when the Iron Curtain fell. It wasn't private corporate greed or capitalism that ruined the rivers and streams in Eastern Europe.I can appreciate hyperbole. This movie shows an extrapolation of policies that focus on making a buck today, with no view of the future sustainability. I just reject the indoctrination of children to have the mantra, ""evil corporations"" pushed into their heads under the guise of a cute Seuss film."
3,too much rock type music,"I don't care for worldly style music at all but especially young children........unnecessary! There were also dance moves, only a few mind you, that were not desirable."
2,Yawn...,"Love Dr,Seuss books....not a fan of this movie though. Very little character build and story seems matter-of-fact, predictable even. Maybe little kids would get more out of this...but I don't consider it Blockbuster material...more like straight-to-video...Gave it to a friend for their kids..."
3,Not what I was hoping for...,Too much singing and too modern a turn on the story line left me disappointed with this latest Dr. Seuss movie. Stick to the book - it's FAR better!
5,Best Movie ever,"This is the best Movie that I have ever seen and our family loved and have watched more than Five times more. Especially for my daughter Kate, she loved it so much! You must watch it!"
5,Funny and Educational,This is a great movie. It has a solid message and is not unbearable to watch a few times with my kids. This is good solid family entertainment with a good message about the environment.
5,I love this movie,"I love this and so does my son. Great deal for the price, thanks SO SO SO much for the classic."
4,The Lora,The Lorax was a good adaptation of the book with some added environmentalism. The opening scene with the bottled air was funny and classic. Good movie. Kids love it.
5,Cute movie!!,My Grandson loves this movie. It was his bday party theme. Ordered as a Christmas gift and it was received in plenty of time.
4,Great kids movie!,The movie was shipped fast and looked to be in perfect condition! This was a Christmas gift for a 9 year old girl and she was very excited when she opened it Christmas morning. We saw the movie in theaters and enjoyed it!
3,Movie was fine packaging was all torn up,"The movie was great, the packaging was all torn up. I guess for $4.99, you can't expect too much. Just hard to give for a gift with the way it came."
3,Kids love it,The kids love it but I thought it was over rated. They break into songs left and right and they're not the best but as long as the kids enjoy I am ok with it.
2,"great movie but regret that it's only ""streaming"" playback","Great movie! Image quality was fantastic too. But i'm really disappointed that it's only a streaming movie file which means that i must have internet connection to watch it. For $14 I expected to have a completely downloaded file to my computer that i can play when or wherever i want. (for the kids on a long road trip for example)I was so mad. If i knew before hand that i would not have full access to the movie then i would not have purchased $14 dollar movie that could only watch ""sometimes""."
4,Parlez-Vous Tree?,"Thneed-ville has everything you need, so you don't have to leave the city for any reason. There are no real trees left, but you can buy trees that turn on by remote control and then select which season you want for the tree, and it only uses 96 batteries. Why, you can even buy fresh air. Well, actually you will need to, but you are in luck because they sell that too!The Lorax is about consumerism and the need for conservation. Achieving a good balance is essential for the survival of all beings on our planet. The short, orange Lorax speaks for the trees. In the movie, the young and successful entrepeneur called Once-ler gets carried away and chops them all down. When he is older, he realizes where he went wrong. Sadly, trees have gone the way of the dinosaurs and are only the stuff of daydreams. Yet, hope is found in a seed."
2,"Great Movie, Bad DVD","I got this because well..............I love the damn movie a lot. But the damn case came broken, it wont close. The package seems to be in really good condition and the outer box that slides into the case seems to be in good condition too and it was new also, but the case wont close, the stupid hook thing was broken. I love the movie, but you know what else I love, if my cases didn't come broken so I can protect the movies I love. Geez amazon, at least check if the damn case is broken or not."
3,Cute political kids movie,"The Lorax"" is pretty blatant in its message. It's about a young boy who sets out to learn the history of his town, meets a creature called the Once-ler, and tells him the land used to be fertile and green. However, the Once-ler discovered that he could create a ""useful invention"" out of the Truffula trees, and when demand for these inventions became great, it resulted in serious environmental problems.The music and thing on the move are catchy and funny but honestly is a movie full of political indoctrination."
5,Very satisfied,No issues at all and shipped quicker than expected. Product was as said and I am satisfied with this purchase.
1,What a disappointment,"I thought this movie would be on the level of Despicable Me and Puss in Boots. I was wrong! This movie is not funny; not endearing; not worth the price being charged for it. I should have known as I had never read the book, and we are huge Dr. Seuss fans."
1,the lorax,i guess would be nice if i could get movie to work on my tablet right now a waste of money on the movie
1,THE LORAX,"Bought this for the kids to watch on the way to our vaction they were not interest at all, I tryed to watch it to but did not make and sence, Sorry did not really like it at all."
2,Really disappointed with DVD only release,the three 'mini movies' appear not to be included with the DVD only disc release.Really not happy with that.. wish it had been spelled out somewhere.
3,Lorax,Bought for my grandson but it didn't really keep his intersest. He loves Cars and Madagascar but he may just be to young for this movie.
5,Love it,"My family loves this movie. It is a great adaptation of the book, and a movie with an important point that doesn't shove it down your throat."
5,Great Buy!,"Bought this on ""Black Friday"" for $4.99. My daughter asks to watch it everyday! The story is educational and the cartoon is comical."
4,My daughter enjoys this movie,My seven-year-old daughter says she likes this movie a lot. I also thought it was cute. I would have given it a 4.5 star rating if it were available. I only didn't give it five stars because she didn't quite say that she loved it.
4,Great show!,"We bought ""The Lorax"" and loved it. Great kids show. Our kids love it and request this show over others on movie night."
4,Cute movie,Huge moral to the story. My daughter and her friends love it. Bold graphics and catchy lyrics. Definitely a good movie
4,Cute show,Kids loved this show in movie theatre so I bought it for them for Christmas. They have watched over and over again.
5,Great family film,Our family loves this show. It has a feel-good story that's told with comedy and catchy songs. It love that it entertains my husband and me along with our young kids all at the same time. My 3 year old even quotes it now and was very excited to receive it for Christmas. Betty White's character is hilarious.
4,Great movie,I love these Dr Suess movies they've been coming out with. This was a great animated movie.. Really enjoyed watching!
4,DR. Seuss' The Lorax,"The movie was pretty good , but the streaming video was pretty bad, with several lost connections. This was the only reason, that I did not give it 5 stars."
5,Very cute Movie !,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Lorax. I thought the art style was very true to Dr. Seuss and I loved the direction that the producers went with the movie. I don't know if it is true to the book exactly as I have not read the book, but I'm sure that people who loved the book will love the movie."
5,Great Christmas Gift,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and was an amazing price at $3.99. She absolutely loves Dr Seuss so this is another perfect gift.
5,My little friend watches it over and over!,Finally a children's movie with very special meaning they can understand with no violence. Very good movie for adults also.
5,Dr. Seuss' The Lorax,"Amazingly adorable movie, my husband even loved it. The bears and animals make this movie so worth it. Thank you."
2,should have watched the trailer before I bought this...,"I find it ironic a man who is an author and prints his books on paper to be so against those who cut down the trees. Dont get me wrong, I love trees and I believe in planting trees but I have no problem with loggers, if anything I think they make use of the trees before they get wasted in a forest fire. Didn't care for this movie at all. I just saw that it was produced by the same company that made Despicable Me so I thought it would be a good one for my kids... Should have watched the trailer, oh well..."
3,"Fun movie, but a little dissappointed","I love the Lorax as a kid (both the book and the original movie) and was eager to see the remake. The movie was okay and my son enjoyed it, however it left a lot to be desired. It just didn't have the magic feel the original did. Way to much singing and politics."
4,That's a woman?,"How ba-a-a-ad can I be, I'm just doing what comes naturally. The songs are so catchy I can't help myself. Let it die, let it die, let it shrivel up and die."
5,dr seuss,This is one of the best animated movies out! My kids love to watch it over and over again. Great price and shipped quickly!
1,"Slow plot, Very boring.","I don't understnad why it gets such a high rating. My husband and I really find it boring. The plot is slow, there are several scene that can be eliminated. We couldn't finish the whole DVD because either one of us would ended up distracted to do other things. Managed to finish it in three days, but also regret that we've even started. The bunnies are cute though."
2,Ripped off by Universal again?,"This review is not about the movie, but about Universal's digital copy practices. My copy of The Lorax arrived, with promise of both Ultra Violet AND digital copy. The instructions to download to my iTunes send me to UniversalDigitalCopy.com/TheLorax. However, there is no such site. So where, pray tell, should I go to redeem my copy? I have searched related sites--nothing. Except they would cheerfully sell me a download for $4.95. Not feeling like paying again!"
4,"It's a kid's movie, made for kids","I think everyone on here needs to calm down. The point of this movie is to teach kids about how chopping down trees hurts the environment. Last I checked this was NOT up for debate. Is it wrong to teach little kids about environmental awareness? I don't think this movie has an ""agenda"" I think it's just a cute kid's movie about a fluffy Lorax who wants to preserve his precious trees. People need to stop putting politics where there isn't any. Yes, many kid's movies have double meanings and hidden parts (the penis on the castle in The Little Mermaid) but I don't think this movie had malicious intent.I plan to buy the 3-D version once the price goes down, which it should because right now it's cheaper at Target. Other then that, it's a cute movie and well worth buying. Dr. Suess is classic, and kids everywhere read him for a reason. I read him as a kid, and I will read his books to my kids."
1,"Good story, BUT...",Very bad picture and I ordered HD. Even my son notiiced the blurriness of the picture. I'll never go online to watch movies unless it's improved.
2,Nothing happens until you are 9/10th of the way in.,"I read the book as a kid, so I was hoping for more. The movie, however, never really begins until it is almost over. It starts with a boy that wants to impress a girl because they were raised with plastic trees and he wants to find a real one for her, so you have that whole back story. But, just when you think the story is about to begin, the boy meets the the guy that destroyed the trees, and now you have that whole back story. Then you have the back story of the main villian that invented air so nobody would need trees for air. Then you have the brief back story of the Lorax and various woodland creatures. Then you have the filler of many highly forgettable songs, and if you blink, it's over. The end. Goodbye."
5,very different take than the book but still true to the point of the story,"This movie is cute. I wish it were a little more like the book, but the overall meaning still gets across."
5,my review,i feel this is a really good movie. its humorous and family friendly. they truly brought out the best of Dr. Seuss.
2,Too much politics in this movie!,"For a kid's movie and for it being a Dr Seuss story, this is way too geared for adults. At least I got it for only $3.99, so I don't feel too bad."
4,Fun movie night!,Really cute movie with a good message. My 9 year old & I really enjoyed it! It was a good length too. Didn't want it to be over!
5,Great Movie,This is a wonderful movie for kids as well as adults. Great values and very entertaining. Takes you back to how the kid movies used to be.
2,Dr. Seuss The Lorax,"I was very disappointed with this movie. It was depressing, boring, and a thinly veiled political statement. It was complaining about big business, and corporations making money. I do not think that this is a good lesson to teach kids. I personally do not think that there is anything wrong with giving your kids the desire to succeed. I care about the environment, but this was really too much!"
3,The Lorax,"I can't say that I dislike this movie, but it was far from exciting. It did have a nice story line, but very much dwelled on the moral part of it. Not saying that they shouldn't, but enough is enough. Got a little boring after a while. The characters are very cute and make you laugh... Just wish they would have embraced this a little more."
4,Definitely entertains the kids,"With kids movies I generally watch with one eye on the screen and one eye on the kids' reactions. My children (4 and 7) enjoyed the movie. It produces an even amount of laughter, pathos, and relief with the ""happy ending"", a visual reminiscent of Wall-E. The bears are cute, the colors pop on the screen, and my boy in particular enjoyed the ""physical"" humor. It has a place on the shelf, and long term, it will probably end up in the second tier of movies on the shelf, the one under the Pixar films."
1,humans are bad blah blah blah,"Oi, while it nicely animated, it was sooo ham handed and heavy in its messaging of ""man is bad, green is good"" that it made the movie just poor. It felt like Happy Feet, but with better advertsing."
1,Horrible movie for kids,"This movie was not a good comedy, it was not a good animation, and even a 5 year old would know it was completely politically motivated.This is pure and simple indoctrination and propaganda for the left."
4,Great Movie,"My son loved it. I wish it was closer to the book, but I understand the changes and why they had to make them. All and all a great movie for people of all ages with a great message!"
1,Product doesn't want to load,DO NOT download this from Amazon. Go buy or rent it from somewhere. It has been playing for less than 40 minutes & has stopped at least 10 times! Ridiculous!!
2,disappointing,"The political message was way too thick. I lost patience with the message and got bored with the movie. My kids enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I will watch it again (not that I finished it the first time)."
4,It's the Lorax,"Great book, good movie. My daughter has already watched it 4 times and we've only had it for 3 days!"
2,made me mad,this movie was alright. Im not into musicals but there was no common sense with the character in this movie.
5,What a price!,3.99? Are you kidding? Great price for a great movie any day!! My classroom kids love this movie and will watch it during Dr. Suess week.
3,Cute but not great,"I watched this with my kids, it was cute but not amazing. It was a So so story, animation was col though"
5,Beautifully Animated,Great story! Good lesson for the kiddos. I am in love with all the vibrant colors and beautiful animation. This is a movie you could watch over and over again.
5,Great story and fun for the entire family,"Dr Seuss stories take me back to my own childhood and that of my children now my Grand-kids - as always great heartfelt stories told in an entertaining way with a rich experience for the entire family.Here is a link to the Amazon Store the Lorax:<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&field-keywords;=The%20Lorax&linkCode;=ur2&tag;=eart20-20&url;=search-alias%3Daps"">The Lorax</a>"
4,Fun movie,"My sons and I thoroughly enjoye this movie! Of you're looking for something ""safe"" to watch with your kids that's not violent etc this is a great choice!"
5,Great movie,"I love this movie, everyone in the house enjoys it. My 2 year old actually sits and watches most of it with us when we do movie family night. My husband really likes dr. seuss (just learned that one and was kind of suprised considering he is not a cartoon guy), and my 9 year old son and I always enjoy chillin out and watching movies. Got it at a great price but I would have bought it for full price."
4,Dr. Seuess does it again!,Dr. Seuss knows how to write children's stories. This is yet another example. The Lorax is well written and documents a good lesson behind the colorful animation.
5,Love it,This is the best Kid animated film I have ever seen also I have twin boys and they love it !
5,I speak for the Trees~,"I've always loved this story, ever since pre-K and I have to say this is definitely my favorite adaptation of The LoraxI recommend this movie to everyone; young, old and everyone in-between~"
3,"Dr. Seuss ""The Lorax"" in 3d","""The Lorax"" was an okay movie. It is a great movie for kids but I would not recommend this movie for adults. If you plan to buy it to give or show to grandchildren - great, otherwise I would recommend passing on this movie.As always, Amazon performed amazingly. I enjoy the buying experience from Amazon and if you have never purchased on-line before, I highly recommend trying Amazon as I know you will be very pleased with the experience."
3,Lorax review,"This movie was just ""ok"" for me and my children. It was very slow at parts and seemed to have ""filler"" scenes. I can't complain too much, though, because the price couldn't be beat and it does teach a good lesson about the environment."
4,Dr.Seuss The Lorax,It is a cute movie to enjoy with your family.Your child will want to watch over and over again each day
3,Dr. Suess' The Lorax,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter so it has not yet been opened and/or watched so I am unable to rate this appropriately until she watches it.
3,story message for older children,"the litmus test was my 5yo son, was amused, not terribly entertained. and, the moral of big business vs conservation was a little advanced for his age"
5,The Lorax,"Thanks for the Lorax, it was a great movie for my grandson and my granddaughter and they both loved it!"
4,Great Movie for all the family,Great movie for the whole family with a strong and important message which it delivers in a fun way.Loved it.
3,so so,Not as i expected. Picture quality was not that good. I would not purchase this movie. I would want more out a company.
1,Is there a way to rate less than 1 star?,This movie absolutely stunk. I'm actually angry that I let my children watch it. Dr. Seuss must be rolling in his grave.
1,Poor remake and does not mirror Despicable Me,"My kids might give this 2 stars, but as an adult that relished the older TV version, this simply stinks. We purchased it because we thought we read somewhere it was made by the same people who did Despicable Me (which we love). Unfortunately it is nothing like the old TV version or similar in style to Despicable Me.If you must try it rent it first and save your money."
2,Very little fun in this one,"This was not a fun movie for my great niece(8ish) and nephews(10ish) like I thought it would be. It turned into a whole lot of hate big business and they are only run by greedy heartless idiots. I could have lived with that if the movie was enjoyable for the kids. They have watched it once(and it did not keep their attention then well) and never ask about it, from what the parents said. Save your money and try a different film, this one will collect dust on the DVD shelf."
1,Horrible,This movie was horrible. I felt minutes draining out of my life while I watched this. Dr Suess books are simple stories. When they make full length movies out of the books the true message is always lost in the political undertones the direcyor and producer try to shove down our throats.
1,Enviromentalist youth indoctrination,Bad corporate type leader keeps trees from growing so he can sell his bottled air. Bad money hungry businessman has cut all the trees down to make more money. Really? Plus the music is really cheesy. Wasn't a fun movie to watch at all the 3d animation was cool.
3,nice message,The cartoon was done well and the green message was obvious but I found the movie boring and during parts it dragged
3,Dr. Seuss' The Lorax,made me smile many times...and of course always nice to see a young man smitten and a wise old lady being a wise old lady
5,Grandsons loved it,Our grandsons love this and the Movie showed up like it should. I would order this again and I am very happy with the results now!>>:L
1,Waste of time.,Watch Horton Hears a Who or How The Grinch Stole X-Mas. They have more heart than this film. Expected more from this film. It didn't do Dr. Seuss' story justice. Or here is a novel idea? Buy the book. The sell it on Amazon.com
2,What?,"Well, obviously advertising this film with and selling out to SUV's was a mistake. So what was the point of making it a 'seussical' when singer/songwriter Taylor Swift never sings? True, the original book did say 'No one can sing who has smog in his throat.' Yet we have a whole crowd song and Audrey (Swift) does not join in. Why? Is she trying to show that she can sing and act? If so, it would be nice if someone explained that."
5,Awesome movie me and my kids loved it!,"The movie was funny, sad, and quite a great messeage for people who don't care about the enviroment or who want to get rich in a bad way. My husband and I adore the enviroment, my kids and I were planning to plant seeds to help the environment. The movie must teach you a lesson about keeping the natural beauty in the world instead of usg toxic waste or smog."
4,good show,bought as a present for my kids they love the film. also makes them think about the environment and cause and effect
5,Movie,"I bought it as a Christmas stocking stuffer for my granddaughter, I thought she would enjoy it, she wanted to see it at the theater."
4,Loved this,"We saw it at the movies and loved the movie. We have not seen the actual video yet to be sure the quality is good, but we will and if for some reason we do find an issue, we'll revisit this review."
5,Love this movie and the price of the DVD!,My grandsons love this movie! They love the Lorax and I love the concept it teaches them. Thank you Dr. Seuss!
3,just ok,A little too heavy on the musical parts for me. The moral seemed to get lost in the plot. Not as great as Horton hears a who.
3,The Lorax,"Not one of my favorite animations for my kids, but entertaining enough to keep them happy. I usually enjoy these unique types of animation but the plot was kind of lame."
4,Fun movie with a message,"This movie is a whimsical tale of the importance of being responsible for the world around us. It highlights how important trees are to our environment and how corporate greed can derail our responsibilities. While this is a fun movie and my grand daughter loves it (7 years old), it does get a bit preachy for those of you who are turned off by the ""yeah environment--boo capitalism"" message."
2,"The Movie ""The Lorax"" Review","bought for my niece who is 5 she normally loves all animation but this one she would not watch, for real it was kind of boring."
4,Cute Movie,"This movie is very cute. It is a good movie to watch with children. However, it is a bit short."
3,Good.,"Movie is very educational. Somewhat boring to the above 8 year age but sends the ""go green"" message for sure. Even my 4 year old got it."
5,Kids said good,it in the theater and wanted it again on dvd.... it is very anti corporate america though :) come by my profile to visit my blog
5,Love the Lorax,"Dr. Seuss is brilliant. This movie is an excellent way to teach kids about conserving and being kind to our planet. I've also used it as a teaching tool by telling my daughter her behavior is Lorax approved or not. Recycling...Lorax approved, pulling all the toilet paper off the roll...NOT Lorax approved."
5,Best movie I have seen in quite sometime!,"Great message, Well made movie and well worth purchasing! I'm 27 and as soon as the movie came to an end I wanted it to start over from the beginning."
3,Not as good as the book,"I was really excited to watch The Lorax movie with my 2 year-old daughter in hopes it would be as special and timeless as Dr. Seuss' book, The Lorax.... unfortunately, it wasn't.The animation was good and the story line ok - it was somewhat based on the book after all. However, I personally did not care for the cheesy style of comedy in comparison to other Dr. Seus movies (e.g. Horton Hears a Who - silly but not cheesy). It just wasn't funny to me. Maybe kids will ""get it"", but I didn't.My last critique focuses on the casting. No offense to Danny DeVito - he is a great actor and comedian and I enjoy his characters in other shows and films - but I never, in all my years of reading the Lorax, imagined Danny DeVito's voice as the Lorax. It just sounds wrong. I struggled with this the entire film.Overall, the movie was OK. Not great. It had a lot to live up to and no doubt fell short. I defnitely won't be purchasing this one, but it was entertaining enough as a one-time rental."
5,love it!,A very entertaining movie that is great for all ages from toddler to great grandma and grandpa. A must see. Well worth the money spent.
5,very cute and funny,"I was not sure about this movie, but my two sons love it. The character Lorax is very funny, and will keep the kids glued to the TV for a good break time haha. Anyways the movie also shares a good message"
5,Great movie for all ages,Bought for my grandson and this one for my nephew. Good and simple understanding of respecting and protecting our environment. Enjoyable.
4,good for kids,"Good kids movie, though I see the political agenda behind the show. While I agree with the message its not that simple."
3,A disappointment.,"I love Dr. Suess (as does my daughter) and the Lorax is a favorite. Why then, did I find this movie boring and dull. I rate it as 2 stars, but my daughter loves the Lorax so much, that I have to give it 3."
5,On behalf of my 3 kids,"They give it 5 stars! I haven't had the pleasure of watching this movie, but my kids enjoyed it. Thank you!"
1,Dr. Seuss would sue for putting his name on this!,"1. the Onceler was not named Onceler, it's a title like Hasbeen.2. they didn't need a badder bad guy than the one who killed all the trees,3. the Lorax did NOT have a happy ending, he never comes back, the trees stay dead forever, and the Onceler goes away to die in shame. Changing the ending absolutely ruins the message at the heart of this story... unless..."
4,The Lorax,Streamed without issue- love this movie! I used it at work via smartboard and everything worked perfect. It was so easy to just click and watch
5,The Lorax DVD,I saw this in the theater and none of the kids in the entire place moved while this movie was playing. It was amazing.I bought it and have enjoyed it just as much. Dr Suess always knew what he was doing.
3,"""Just One Look"": A Mixed Exchange for the Big and Little Screens","In animation, in plot, and in rhyme and song, 'The Lorax,' movie has somewhat elaborated from the Dr. Seuss' book. Sometimes it's a pay off, but at other times it is a letdown. In pace, they are snappy enough, but in song and in dialogue, they don't add much quality to the overall movie experience. There are some pretty dull lines and some lame lyrics when you listen carefully to both the words and songs. Still, the characterization (including voices from the likes of Zac Efron and Betty White) are endearing, and the vibrant, flowing visuals make this 'Lorax' good enough for at least viewing once."
5,CANT LIVE WITHOUT,This movie is a must ! I have a 3 1/2 year old watching it and she LOVES it.... Also the older kids think it is good. Great for the whole family.
5,Great kids movie,My two six year old sons loved this movie and watched it two more times before our rental was expired.
3,"Lacked the Seuss magic, too heavy handed","I watch movies like this to enjoy them. Unfortunately, this movie was just too heavy to really enjoy. I realize that the message is conservation, I get it. But they pounded it too hard. Lost some of the magic that Seuss is famous for."
3,One of the less inventive Dr seuss offerings,In the past I have always enjoyed Dr Seuss cartoons converted to video offerings but the Lorax was slightly dissapointing and less inventive than other films have been. Storyline was mundane and characters shallow loosing all interest for adults. Probably OK for kids though.
4,Very Cute movie!,"Cute movie. I could see some large undertones (maybe over tones) of paralleling Money hungry greedy business vs. environmentalists to an extreme, but the message isn't off. Let's not get ridiculous here and start selling air!"
5,Great expectations,"Haven't had the chance to watch it yet, but loved the previews. Great imagination and talented animation. Light hearted and easy to get into."
3,Dr. Seuss' The Lorax is just fair,"I would rate The Lorax as just fair. It really isn't something I would choose to watch again, but our five- and seven-year-old grandsons seemed to enjoy it."
3,kids liked it,"kids liked it, and there's a message that they get from it. some darkness but not too bad (compared to what else is out there)"
5,"Excellent, kid friendly movie","I think I enjoyed this movie as much as my daughters. The humor was very cute. Sure, it is a eco-message movie, but so what? The kids enjoy it and what is wrong with having kids that recognize trees give us air to breathe?"
4,Good Seuss!,"It was a wonderful reprieve from the week of work. My wife, 17-year-old daughter, and I thoroughly enjoyed the flick. Very artfully done. The story was fun and the message is a good one for us all. Take a break and see it!"
3,Just ok.,"Look no further than any Disney/Pixar film. Those are the gold standard. Films like Lorax are ok, but just do not have....dare I say, the Disney/Pixar magic."
4,Happy to Own it!,"Great movie for the whole family! Fun music and good message! My kids love nature anyway, and now they wish there were really tress that were that colorful in real life! Too CUTE!"
4,cute film,We bought this for my 5 year old who like it. I thought it was quite good. Nice message for all - young and old. As always Amazon has the best price.
3,Very cute!,This movie was adorable. I loved it. Got me through my boyfriend's dentist appointment lol. It wasn't what I was ecpecting it to be but was still good and would watch it again.
5,"great movie, great price","This item was sent in great condition at a great price. I recommend this movie for family night, it was fun."
4,We really like it,Good family film and really has suitable language for all ages. Great visuals and art. My 7 yo still likes to watch this.
5,How could you not love Dr. Seuss?,"Obviously a more updated version of the Dr. Seuss book, but the message is still the same. This is a great movie - my son (who is 7) and I absolutely love it."
4,Great Movie for Kids Parents too would enjoy,My Niece and I watched this movie together we both enjoyed it. Good life lesson on taking care of the earth. But also it showed that it is never too late. People can right wrongs and undo past mistakes. Its also some pretty funny lines that my Niece couldn't help but repeat. (That's a WOMEN!!!)
4,My 4-year-old grandson loved it!,"I have a 4-year-old grandson who is rather energetic, which makes it difficult for him to hold his attention in any one area for very long. We recently ordered ""Dr. Seuss' The Lorax"" on my Roku (from Amazon.com). My grandson sat throughout the entire movie, quite spellbound. We all enjoyed the movie as well as its message!"
3,Had higher expecations for the movie,"I thought this would be a good kid movie so I purchased it during the after Thanksgiving deals. The DVD was fine, the movie itself was kind of lame. The only part that stands out is the beginning of the movie with the singing and that's about it...Would rethink before buying this, and glad I didn't purchase on bluray."
2,Misses the mark,"The animation and visuals are great. But the story is really lacking, and the comedy is unfortunately sparse and weak. Very disappointing considering that this comes from the same people who made the fantastic Despicable Me."
2,Couldn't finish it,I think we didn't finish this movie. It just didn't capture our attention which is unfortunate because it is a good story. I definitely like the 15 minute storybook better... sometimes stretching out a story doesn't work so well.
2,Not too good. I'm not too sure my kids enjoyed it either.,"The movie was not very good. For an animated feature, there are usually a few laughs for the adults and a more for the kids, but I'm not sure this had too many all the way around. Fairly boring. I'd say pass on this one.The picture quality was very good."
3,The original is much better,"Having seen the earlier version of the Lorax, the new one pales in comparison. The original Lorax had some of the best artwork and color palette of any animated film to date. The film was aesthetically pleasing to the core.The new version is formulaic. The artwork is actually pretty good, but the story and pacing are uninspired and uninteresting. There is also a very serious, realistic tone to the new film (i.e. character mannerisms, music, etc) that ruin it. The old version had an almost ""magical"" look and feel to it."
5,Lorax,"Dr. Seuss would be proud of this book adaptation. Is message remains clear, someone had to care. Children and adults will enjoy this movie."
3,Better For Kids,"My wife and I both enjoy cartoon movies, but we don't always like every single one. This particular one was semi entertaining, but we honestly grew a bit bored with it and figured after the fact that it was a good one time watch, but probably wouldn't own it or watch it again.However, if you have kids, there is plenty of entertainment value for them in it...my wife and I ourselves just couldn't get into it as much as say movies like Up, Finding Nemo, etc. If you're a person that likes animated movies, I'd still say give it a watch because it may yet be something you yourself would like, and if you have kids, they would probably like it."
5,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OUT THERE :),"THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY AND IT MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT THIS EARTH AND HOW IT IS BEING CONTAMINATED BY STUFF THAT WE DON'T NEED. AND HOW VULNERABLE WE ARE AND IGNORANT TO BUY INTO IT. EVER SINCE WATCHING THIS MOVIE I FEEL LIKE IT IS MY DUTY TO RECYCLE AND MAKE SURE EVERYBODY I KNOW AT LEAST GIVES IT A TRY, IT COULD REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WELL WORTH BUYING AT A STORE TO KEEP PERMANENT AND SHARE IT WITH YOU FRIENDS."
3,Pretty cute movie!,"Not a bad movie, definitely a cute children's movie. I would say this is another great on demand option for families."
2,A Colorful Disappointment,The movie starts slowly and died in the middle but the plot was okay. The ending is not thought out very well it just leaves you saying is that it. The Lorax wasn't in the movie long enough and it was sort of a musical with awful auto-tune.
5,Cute movie for kids and adults,This is a cute movie for kids and adults. The meaning behind it was very powerful. I'd recommend it to my friends and family.
5,Love,Great packing. Great movie. We love it so much. Thanks for the hard work put in to packing the time!
4,Good but the original cartoon was better,"I enjoyed this movie, but found myself wishing throughout that it had incorporated the original lorax story intact rather than be simply based on it"
3,Missing something,"Not sure what this was missing or if I'm just jaded because the 70's Lorax cartoon is one of my utmost favorites. It had some catchy songs, but songs do not make a movie. Kids sat through it and asked to watch it a couple more times, but it has already been forgotten. They also weren't interested in the 70's version - so their opinion has been officially negated in my household."
5,Great movie for young and old alike,"I am a mother of 2- a four year old and an almost 2 year old. Both of my children love this movie. Not only do my children love it, but this is one of those movies I secretly look forward to watching as well. The animation is fantastic, but more importantly the message is as well. It's never too soon to teach your children about conservation!"
4,enjoyable movie,Good movie. Most enjoyable and thought provocing when people just want to ignore nature. A great resone to worry about what is happening to the world. With how much we are messing up things A good movie about taking care of the world so are kids can have a life like ours.
4,THE LORAX IS COLORFUL FUN,"I am not a big fan of Dr. Seuss stories--Jim Carrey's GRINCH was tolerable...Mike Myers' CAT IN THE HAT was abyssmal.THE LORAX is pretty enjoyable. The contrasting color schemes are visually imressive and the voice characterizations, especially Danny DeVito and Ed Helms, are quite good. The shamefully ubiquitous Betty White is just another Betty White shtick.Most of the music is forgettable, but John Powell's instrumental score fits nicely.The film's heavy ecological message is tempered by comic moments, especially by the forest animals. The movie is the spawn of DESPICABLE ME creators but it's nowhere as much fun as the Minion-populated classic.Older kids and adults should find THE LORAX palatable entertainment."
5,Vetch charger and adapter wall charger,Everything came as expected and everything worked fine. The adapter wall charger worked fine with what I needed it for and also the vetch car charger works great
4,We like this movie...,our kids are 4 and 5 1/2 and we also just got it for our 3 year old niece. Very cute movie.
4,i like it,"this movie is just okay to me. I think it is a little boring and I don't like the music in it, but my kids like it. Nothing compared to despicalble me though. That movie is awesome."
5,Loved it,This was a gift for my godchildren for christmas. They loved it as much as the first time in the theaters and I couldn't beat the price on amazon.
3,Grand view,was enjoyable time spent with grandchildren. Even my wife and I enjoyed the movie. I do believe this is fit for family enjoyment
5,Love it!,"My kids love it, they watch it every night before bed. It was a birthday present for my daughter and she was just the happiest gilr when it came in."
4,Adorable,This was so funny and adorable I would definitely recommend it not just for young children but also for any age Dr Seuss does it again
5,the lorax,"This is a great kids movie, my children loved seeing the movie, so if you need a good family movie for movie night this is it!!!"
1,Moms and Dads - do your homework!,"Don't trust this movie! All the bad guys are capitalists and business people - but the goal isn't to be successful, make money, support a family or achieve the American Dream. No! All the ""bad guys"" want to accomplish here is pointless destruction and pollution. It seems that they would actually be happy being be LESS successful, but only as long as more innocent destruction is guaranteed along the way! TWO WORDS: Cliche and Microcosm.... So sad that we have come to this as a people."
5,Awesome Movie,"My family thoroughly enjoyed this movie. My loves the ""Lorax"" book and loves to see the characters play out in the movie!"
3,love movie but?,Part of the movie is fuzzy like I'm supposed to wear 3d glasses with. I am unhappy about the clarity of this movie.I love this movie to death by the way.
4,Dr. Suess would be proud,"I grew up reading Dr. Suess, so can I say loved the Lorax, it was fun not preachy and tells a good story as only Dr. Suess can do.Four Stars!YAY!"
5,Well done,It teaches valuable lessons on many levels and is entertaining for all ages. I would recommend movie this to anyone.
4,Why the songs?,"Had the musical numbers in this movie been a bit less lame or not there at all, I would have given this a 5 star rating.They could have done so much better with the songs. They came across as something you would expect from a straight to DVD production, not something of this movie's caliber. It didn't do the film justice at all."
1,"Less political propaganda, please?","While the original story has an ecological theme. This movie takes it to a whole different level. From a back-handed slight to believers in God, to demonizing all corporations and thematically denouncing entrepreneurs and profits. Such as the idea that the president of a corporation is intentionally polluting the air so his company can make a profit by selling people clean bottled air. Finally the city walls are destroyed presumably so that the ""healing"" can begin. I always liked the story of The Lorax. This just felt like a propaganda film by some Earth-First organization. I just wish I hadn't bought the electronic version so I could at least throw it in the trash."
3,review of Lorax two pack DVD,"I ordered the Lorax two pack DVD. I only received one DVD. When I called about it, I was told that there was only one offered. However, I did not see this. If I had wanted to order just the one DVD, I could have gotten it cheaper. I paid a few dollars more to get the two pack and did not receive what I thought I was getting."
1,"Sorry to say, not a winner by a long shot","Preview looked interesting, but even though the 3D add some visual fun the overall movie did nothing for me. The jokes weren't funny and the ploit just didn't develop into anything amazing. Save your money, I wish I had!"
3,Good but...Cotton Candy For Little Kids,"This movie is good for kids. It has HOLLYWOOD written all over it. Be prepared for a ""BAD"" song in the middle. Pretty decent movie though. Be prepared for some wackiness. The only reason I saw this movie was because Taylor Swift acted in it."
1,Completely didactic,"I care about the environment as much as anyone, but this movie was nothing but a pulpit where anything human made is inherently bad and how the world is only good if a wild animal is at home squatting on it. For contrast, James Cameron eloquently stated his environmental position in the extra features included with the movie Avatar and is much more realistic about the balance between the wild and human habitation.I would not recommend this animated movie to anyone."
1,Don't waste your time,WAY too much liberal propaganda. It was nauseating. We had to have a big talk with the kids. Save your time. Don't bother renting this mess.
4,Good movie!,"My grandchildren really loved this movie. Dr. Seuss is timeless. If you have children, they'll probably enjoy it. Mine certainly did."
4,Great Adaptation of Dr Seuss,I got this as a gift and it was very well received. Having read the book before watching it with them it was interesting to see how it was adapted into a movie. Overall its a great choice and another fun adaptation of a Dr Seuss book
3,Cute movie,We love this movie and amazon truly does offer the best price. The bright colors will hold your childs attention and the humor and storyline appeals to adults too!
4,The Lorax,"Although the story varies a little too much from the original, it keeps the kids engaged enough to get the underlying message."
5,Love,The Lorax is such a great movie. It's pretty funmy even for the adults and has a great message. 2 thumbs up. :)
5,Got lucky,Daughter asked for this for Christmas and got lucky and found it for $3.99 new. Adorable movie in perfect shape. Could not have been happier.
5,Great movie,"Its my 3 year old favorite movie, she knows it by memory alredy and so do I...but I don't mind because it teaches a great lesson of taking care of nature!"
2,Educational,could have been a cute movie IF the musicals werent in it. I like the teaching about the enviroment part of this video.
2,not real entertaining,"slow movie, with not a lot of action/entertainment. a real push on the save the trees movement. that was a clear message."
5,Fabulous,This is a great movie for any age. A great lesson and very fun. I love it and so does my 3 year old!
3,Didn't download correctly,I couldn't rate any higher than a 3 as the download wouldn't go through right away and we didnt have a chance to finish the movie before it expired.
4,"Good movie, good message","The movie is very well done. Great animation and very interesting storyline (which I will not spoil). It does have a good message in it about protecting our planet without being preachy about it.It is good for the whole family. My 3 yr old likes the animation, even if he misses the finer points of the movie."
3,Pretty Good Movie,Not sure what I expected from a childrens book made into a movie but it was pretty good. . .
5,Great!,We loved this movie in the theater and love it just as much at home. Kids were so happy to get their own copy and amazon had it at a good price.
2,Boring,"Ugh, used to love this book, but the movie did not capture the essence of the book. They tried and Danny Devito's voice is solid, but the movie is slow-going and didn't maintain my interest. Visually, it is beautiful, but the story is ho-hum."
4,Great DVD,Gave this as a Christmas present....great message about the environment... great for kids old and young...Love Dr. Seuss... anything that he wrote is good for film....
3,Leaves me wondering,"So, this will definately be a hit with the kids. It's got good songs and interesting characters. My son has been asking to watch it daily. My problem with this movie is that it appears a certain agenda is trying to be pushed. I was fine with the movie up until the very end which made absolutely no sense. Everything is going wrong and the bad guys are about to win, but then the main character uses heavy machinery to randomly destroy a wall and everyone's perspective immediately changes. The message is cause mass destruction to get everyone's attention and it will change their mind?"
5,Great movie,Great movie and a Great Price. Other places still charge $15.00 for the same movie. Thanks for the great move at a great price.
4,A supportive approach for those involved in violence,"Safety is nicely addressed. Confrontation with the batterers has been substituted for responsability for both, the victim and the children. The idea of 'stable third part', representing the institution(s) involved, improves the quality of the therapy, and the decision-making process of all involved."
1,Dont buy this!,"This DVD has nothing to do with the US Government other than it has US Government Web pages on it. Amazon should remove the reference in the title ""by US Government"" as it seems to infer that the DVD is produced by the US Government - this is completely untrue.This DVD has nothing to do with 2005 other than that it may have some 2005 web pages amongst the data - I could not see any.Its title ""2005 Complete Guide to UAVs"" is very deceptive! There is basically no recent information off any relevance on this CD. It has old information and there is nothing that cannot be quickly found on the web using Google. It has some newer (2004) US DoD web pages with press releases of little relevance.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
4,Good Value,I bought this for my daughters bedroom and ended up using it in our Den and bought another (white) for the daughter. Worth the price. Solid quality.
2,two drawer nightstand,"The company responded immediately to my distress at trying to assemble this nightstand, so this rating is not aimed at the customer service of Prepac. They just need to stop carrying this item. The assembly directions are ridiculously long and there are dozens of little parts. I actually ruined it trying to put make something attractive enough to have by a bed and gave up on it and now the frame holds tools in the garage."
3,A Bit Thin,"Towner sounds a bit lost here, to me. He doesn't do antthing he hasn't done better before.I like Bruford and Gomez' playing but I find this record lacks energy. It sounds very much to me like various 1970's ECM and Oregon recordings. Bill was getting his feet on the ground well though and I like his subsequent Earthworks efforts very much. Best track is ""Never the Same Way Once"" which was redone more impressively by Earthworks after this."
3,"Good, considering.....","These are NOT the original recordings. But, I must say they are quite good remakes made in the late '80s. No notes of any kind are included. Greene is in terrific voice here. Get the originals if you can, then look for this one."
3,redundant,Merely some of the works in his other books. If you have the others this is a waste. If you are not a serious collector of his work and just want a taste this is okay. Sturges' work can be breathtaking and this collection just doesn't do him justice.
5,Great Photographer,Once again another book of Mr. Sturges that celebrates the beauty and grace of God's most wonderful creation
1,This Dog Don't Hunt,"This product is virtually worthless for the serious road warrior. The network is thin and doesn't even work in some major hub airports. Even if you find a city where the network is viable, you most certainly must stand in front of a window, or go outside to connect. I travel half of each week and quickly found that the purchase of this product, and worse, the pre-paid year of Omnisky service was a huge mistake. After a few months of use, the minstrel now sits unused in my closet. I still use my Visor as my primary PDA, but I recently purchased a discounted Palm VIIx, which I carry to get wireless email. One guy at Omnisky reminded me that the Omnisky network is faster than palm.net...I told him that anything that works (palm.net) is faster than something that doesn't. Save your money on this dog."
1,"CAVEAT EMPTOR! (Latin for: ""Let the Buyer Beware"")","Had a Palm VII and upgraded to a Handspring Visor Prism. Thought it would be great to get wireless on the Prism and tried out Omnisky.What a nightmare.The software they sent was corrupted which required hours with Tech Support and software patches to fix. Then after that problem was solved, email wouldn't work because the Omnisky email server had problems. Then the wireless coverage was *HORRIBLE!* (el stinko!). And that's here in the Bay Area where we're suppose to be the tech center of the nation. Overall, this was a real disappointment.I sent the modem back and cancelled service.Omnisky KNOW their wireless coverage is horrible and they sell you their service anyway hoping that you'll just grin and bear it. If wireless connectivity is essential, buy a Palm VII or wait until better options come out.Omnisky? That dog won't hunt."
1,WARNING: Major Coverage Problems,"I purchased the Omnisky modem/service for my Visor Platinum with the hopes of checking my email during my commute on the train between downtown Chicago and the Western Suburbs. Connectivity is spotty at best. I would say I get a stable connection less than 5% of the time I attempt to connect. NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE TROUBLE.Their software also crashes my Visor nearly every time I use it.I will give high praise, however, to Omnisky's technical service. They are quick to respond and willing to offer multiple possible solutions. The problem is that none of the solutions seem to work.I would recommend against buying this product until they drastically improve their coverage area and fix the software."
3,it's fine,"I'm not in love with this shampoo. It's fine though. I probably will not purchase it again. For the money, I'd rather buy something that wows me."
4,buy this product,"buy this product if you have chemically processed hair, leaves it hydrated and super shiny!"
5,This is worth your last 2 dollars,This cd has all the hits Johnnie made while recording on the stax record label. So if you are looking for songs like still called the blues and just because you will not find them on this box set. But just about every other song he made you will find on this cd. I bet they are having a party in soul heaven. R.I.P. Johnnie Taylor!
2,Item Different than displayed,"The item I received is not the same color or shape to what is pictured online. The product was also delayed in shipping, which was addressed by customer service in a timely fashion. I'm mostly dissatisfied that the color of the stone is so different, which is a deep blue with small hint of green. I bought it as a present for my girl friend as opal is her birthstone. I've looked through literally hundreds of earrings and now I'm not even confident I'm giving her her birthstone. If it wasn't a time concern, I'd promptly return the earrings I received."
1,Plagerized hogwash,"Popular science books seem to be in vogue-- great for any legitimate scientists that sincerely want to get something across to ""lay"" people. But hacks gathering together a bunch of stuff to amaze us is worse than Ripley.I wouldn't pass this book on to to a 4th grader.Since you are interested in only raves, I am sure that this missile will quietly disappear"
4,"Good, two player stuff could be better",I really have fun with boggle. The only thing I wish was that it would have better games for two people to play. I still think it worth it and it can be fun as a solitary game.
1,Unwanted,This would not install on my XP computer regardless of what I tried. It may work on an easlier version of Windows.
2,"Poor volume, speakers crackle",I am not impressed with the speaker bar at all. Maybe I have a defective one because the volume all the way up is not loud at all and the speakers sometimes crackle.
3,Where is the remote?,I have one question for Gateway...why didn't you make a remote for this? If someone is going to be hooking up a DVD player to the monitor then it is a drag to jump up and down to adjust the sound. That would be a great addition to this speaker bar.
5,WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?,"FINALLY, A HELPFUL & INTERESTING REVIEW OF SOME OF THE HUNDRED'S OF BEAUTY PRODUCTS OUT THERE! WITH SO MANY CHOICES ON THE MARKET IT IS HARD TO KNOW THE QUALITY OR EFFECTIVENESS FROM ONE TO THE NEXT. THIS BOOK IF VERY HELPFUL. LOVE THE SAMPLES. I GAVE THESE AS GIFTS & IT WAS A BIG HIT! THANKS AGAIN!!"
3,The Beauty Byble,"Excellant book for beauty products. Comes with a variety of samples. Offers tips on which products work best for all budgets. I'm not sure how many products were tested, there were some products that I have used that I felt were overlooked or some that were given high ratings and weren't the best in the category. Did seem to favor a lower budget (which could be good), however, there are some nice quality high end products out there."
5,The Beauty Buyble makes buying goofproof,"I loved this book because instead of trying 8 or 10 products before you found a good one, this book has done the research for you. All the products I have tried that were recommended by this book I thought were great - really better than what I had been using. Some of the purchases were the cheaper ones, and I was amazed at how great they were: for example the E.L.F. eyeliner and lip gloss. I also tried the Chanel liquid foundation: expensive, but so worth it. Definitely a good book for anyone who buys cosmetics and beauty products regularly."
3,Too much you can't use,The byble gives some good tips but I was disappointed in the promise of so many samples. Most of the samples are little foil packets of lotion(boring) and the few fun things like lipgloss and eyeliner are colors that no one would ever use.
3,Not as great as I expected,I bought this book because I am addicted to beauty products. Unfortunately this book is mostly about items you buy in the drug store and some brands that I have never heard of. I don't feel that the book gives enough choices - I wish it would have had a drug store section and a higher end section. The samples that come with it are not ones that I would use - I was expecting more.
4,"A lot of fun for the money, just keep expectations in check!","This book reviews a fair selection of products in a fun manner for the most part. Special sidebars contributed by guest writers seem to be nothing but an elaborate ad for whatever company the guest is working for (or owns). The authors' writing styles are conversational but I found some of the political commentary annoying and out-of-place in a beauty book.As far as the samples are concerned, the full-sized products and magazine subscription included in my package more than covered the cost of the set. A lot of the product samples are great for travel, and the box is a great place to stash all the other product samples we receive at the mall, etc. I feel I got my money's worth with this product, even though I haven't found a ""holy grail"" product among their recommendations."
2,The Beauty Buyble Was A Disappointment,"I was by and large disappointed by this book. I expected an unbiased guide that would cover more product offerings. Their recommendations were quite limited. This could have been a wonderful guide, but instead, it left me with few options for changing any beauty products I currently use. Also, their cover sheet explaining the ""samples"" in the box stated that one product was a ""shampoo"". It was NOT a shampoo, but a scalp oil treatment...something I found out while using this product."
3,Another Beauty Rip Off,"I knew this book sounded too good to be true. It is such a chore having to research beauty products, then find out that (most of the time) it was all hype. Plus, the amount of money spent on ""products that promise"" can really hit hard. I've decided to purchase at Long's or Sephora where they have a great return policy for products that you don't like. Anyway, this book sounded great...and did have a few great product suggestions, but overall it endorsed only the products that they provided samples for. I can ususally get samples for free...a lot less than the price of this book. It would have been a best seller had the authors included many different product lines....like Physicians Formula (great eye makeup remover) and other ""drug store brand"" products. Save your money on the book. That's my review."
1,Save your money,"Don't waste your money. This book is nothing like Paula Begoun's book ""Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me""."
1,Huge disappointment,"I was looking forward to hearing about the Best Products of 2007, but found the book & products a huge disappointment. Most of the samples ARE sample size except for lip balm. Very little information was given about each product and many of the products are not New to 2007. The products were rated but didn't explain why. Spend your money on ""Don't Go To The Cosmetic Counter Without Me."""
5,A Great Gift!,"I got one for my girlfriend, who's a big ""products"" person, and it is such a great thing that I got one for a friend and one for my secretary for Christmas. It solves the problem of which of the jillions of products to buy and lets the women in your life pick things for themselves."
1,Hype Gripe,"Like another reviewer, I purchased this book because I saw a segment about it on morning TV. What a waste of money! The book is a softcover edition, very short, and reviews a lot of products I've never seen available anywhere. There were very few products reviewed that most of us are used to purchasing in stores. The samples were a joke, nothing more than a small number of tiny one-use products. This was a terrible waste of money. Self Magazine did a much more comprehensive review of beauty products in its May 2006 edition and it was much cheaper."
2,Save your money....,"The reviews seemed to be limited to a few product lines; I had no sense that exhaustive testing had taken place. Funny, the authors seemed to favor the products of the guest reviewers! Advice contradicted itself; for example, on one page it said to apply SPF before moisturizer, while on the next it said the exact opposite.The $50 of free samples I'd value at closer to $10 and not the stuff you'd be wanting to try. The whole effort screams product promotion and not legitimate recommendations."
1,Great idea - terrible book!,"The idea for this book is great and I wish more beauty books included samples. That said, this is the WORST beauty book I have ever read. They recommend products from the same product lines again and again, making me wonder if they have a conflict of interest or if they were just too lazy to try other brands. Also, the samples are mostly from really cheap brands, with a few exceptions, and not worth it. Too bad - I was really excited about the idea."
2,Not really worth the price.,"I agree with other reviewers who said that there's no evidence any real comparison testing was done with these products. The samples were mostly packets of skin care items. There were 3 full-size lip products (not the expensive lip-plumper-it was tiny), but one caused serious irritation, one was too dark for me, and one was too old and waxy to be useful. I was shorted one product, and the product list wasn't entirely accurate. There was also a card for a free magazine subscription - I sent it in but never got any magazines (I did suddenly start receiving more junk-mail, however. I suspect that's related.) The book is so-so at best - mildly entertaining, but nothing to be taken very seriously."
3,Not worth full price,Thank goodness I didn't pay full price for this. Mine was missing some of the samples on the list included in the box. Overall it's ok. The concept was good.
4,Voice It - Recorder,"My husband and I own three of these. They are great for those of us who are ""memory challenged."" My husband is a real estate broker and he keeps one in his car to record property listing phone numbers and addresses (for lease/sale signs). I keep mine on the visor to remind myself of the things I think of while I am sitting in traffic! I also use it for my grocery/shopping lists.I also taped the instructions on the back of mine (a previous reviewer did the same). My only dissatisfaction with mine is that the cover for the battery case kept popping off so I taped it closed. This recorder is thin and lightweight and is very easy to use."
5,Saint-sans String Quartets,"These are by far my favorite Saint-Sans pieces, and my favorite string quartets by any composer. The more I listen to this cd, the more I love it."
5,Did you think your mind is single ?,"Ornstein here provides in this concise book arguments in favour of the multi-faceted working of the mind. If something can be called ""mind"", then it must be realized that several minds (functions) work throughout the brain. There is no single entity that can be called the ""mind"" as several processes work in parallel and contend for a higher-layer, call it consciousness, soul or whatever. Using recent works in psychology, Ornstein demonstrates that no single entity can cover the different, and even inconsistent aspects that underlie our human behavior."
3,Not a good buy,"Although it is a 2nd ed., still too many mistakes. Very few explaination. Ridiculously expensive. Not a good buy."
4,A nice little gem for the patient reader,"In this short book, the narrator reconstructs a tragedy from his childhood, and the events that lead up to it, 50 years after it happened. It is a masterful reflection on the hazy and unreliable filter of memory.The book's pace is often slow, and I sometimes found myself confused about which character the story was discussing. Nevertheless, it is beautifully written. Some of the passages are truly amazing. The story itself builds gradually, but by the time it is over, the effect is heartbreaking. It is a sad tale with no winners. But for the patient and thoughtful reader, it offers the kind of wisdom that only a master writer in his autumn years can offer."
4,Thoughtful and Elegant,"With the use of simple words, phrase, and the charming use of ""flashbacks"", the book describes a murder, the lives that were impacted by it, the events that led to the murder, and one man's guilt in not offering solace. What is profound is that the title is so ironic, filled with shame, with fate's mysterious ways in parting friends. But the reader will ultimately ask, were the two boys at the heart of the story friends, and why exactly did the narrator's guilt haunt him into old age. A lot is left unsaid in this story, but the images provoked and the symbols suggested lend a simple power to the story that, if allowed, might touch the reader. ""So Long, See You Tomorrow"" is a book that should be read slowly to enjoy its simplicity, and it should be allowed to impact how the reader views the whole concept of ""memory."" For the ultimate question still remains: Is memory and one's past reality or fiction?"
4,Good,"Interesting perspective of a man reflecting on his childhood memory of a murder and his brief friendship with son of the suspect. I am reading it on my kindle, find myself not able to finish it. I like the book just not the kindle will most likely go get paperback to finish."
2,"So Long, See You Tomorrow;","So Long See You Tomorrow was chosen as a read by my book club. I found it boring and a little confusing, even though others who had read it found it interesting."
2,Somewhat dull and unsatisfying,"Somewhat dull and unsatisfying, like some other ""literary"" works I've read which don't hole my interest, don't resolve problems, swimming endlessly in the inner thoughts of a person with no action or only references to previous actions. I enjoyed his 'They Came Like Swallows' because it was very satisfying, but this is too ""literary"" for me in the sense that it appears to be more about the writer's writing ability than the actual story."
1,"This Is Not A Review, It's A Warning","I am a voracious reader, but I hardly ever bother to take the time to review a book. I'm making an exception as a public service. This is not a review. It's a warning. Don't waste your time or money on this book. I checked out many of the glowing reviews of it, and stayed up half the night reading it, waiting for something good to happen. It didn't. This book is awful. Ugly. Boring. Crap."
4,A Quiet Classic,"This is a really beautiful book that is really one human's musings about his life and his friendship with another. The language is sparse, but the emotional intensity is quite huge."
3,"True to life, with nice farm country descriptions","The book's story takes place in Illinois in the 1920's. In the beginning the characters are enjoying a fantastic life on the farms with family and close friends. The children are happy too.Then emotions take over and their lives are ripped apart.The author has one nagging little ""I should have said something at the time but didn't"" thing in his brain that he couldn't get rid of, like most of us probably do, even if it is kind of trivial.It was kind of hard to keep the characters straight, but otherwise okay."
4,Hidden Treasure,"In my opinion, So Long, See You Tomorrow is an excellent book. I was assigned to read it for English, and to be honest, when I first began to read it I wasn't impressed. However, I was soon completely swept into the book - I couldn't put it down for the last few chapters. It chronicles a murder that occured in a small town. The narrator was good friends with the son of the accused murderer. Not only does this story have a fascinating account of a murder, it's has strong coming of age themes as well as lessons about friendships and forgiveness. It's also incredibly well written. Maxwell uses a very direct writing style; you get all the info in very succinct sentences. He also uses several different points of view to keep things interested. If you read this book, keep with it! You might get lost in the first few chapters, or classify it as boring, but if you just pay attention and keep reading you'll find a wonderful treasure of a book."
5,Appealing in all ways...,"A captivating novela, ""So Long, See You Tommorow"" would appeal to any reader in numerous ways. Its true-to-life issues are easily relatable and constantly reflect in daily life. The narrator, arguably Maxwell himself, recounts events from his past. The one-hundred thirty-five page length does not allow for ambiguousness, and Maxwell manages to tell his story concisely without giving the feeling that something is missing. I read ""So Long, See You Tomorrow"" for my high school English class not expecting anything as enthralling as this book. I consider it one of the most readable books in my collection and highly recommend it for a quick, but thought provoking read."
2,Jumpy and Muffled,"The sound quality was so bad that either I was turning up the volumn or being shouted down by it. Although the material was good and effective the presentation seemed not to have been well thought out. There were constant stops in the program just when the material was getting good. By the time it started again I had been distracted and had to start over. If they had given the content twice as much time between breaks and produced the CD correctly in reference to the sound quality, I think it would have been a very good product. Here's hoping they get it right next time."
2,"Sound quality horrid, roller-coaster learning curve","I should have looked at reviews of other DVDs from this publisher. Sounds (and appears on presenter) like a cheap lapel mic scraping across a collar button, plus various crackling and pops. But a few lessons sound very clear, so it wasn't the disc. Solid introduction to ASP.net veers tragically off course with irrelevant intro to O-O programming in VB. Too bad, since he's a pretty good presenter, and I learned some really useful details not clear in other sources."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"Frankel has written about a complex topic in a manner that is personal and inviting. Whether you are Jewish or not, spiritual or not, interested in therapy or not, the book is welcoming and accessible. The many parables and quotes from Rabbis through history are wonderfully apt. The book has a quality of deep teaching. The writing flows effortlessly. This is a book to enjoy the first time through, and to re-read and refer to throughout the course of a lifetime."
5,sacred therapy,This is an excellent book for anyone interested in the union between Jewish philosophy and psychology. The author bases her psychological discussion on kabalistic thought and beautifully weaved in stories from the Torah through which our personal stories and experience emerge and become meaningful. She also includes meditations and exercises that help to integrate the material. This is an excellent book for anyone interested in the relationship between spirituality and the psyche.
2,"Good, but not the best.","I purchased this record influenced by the good review by Beranga. I own several recordings of the Symphonie Espagnole. I didn't have time to compare it with all of them, but the recordings by Anne-Sophie Mutter, Sarah Chang, Howard Zhang and Marat Bisengaliev, which I did compare with this one by Amoyal are all better. I did not find Amoyal warmer or more energetic. He plays well, of course, but not better than the ones I mentioned."
2,Buy Naughton instead,"This book is built around a series of dialogues and vocabulary. It doesn't have much of the other things you need for learning a language such as grammar points and exercises. Though it's more extensive (with the cassettes), you're much better off with Naughton's book. Even so, I use Letnanova's dialogues as refreshers that give me some variation. Letnanova would probably be OK if you were working with a teacher, but you can't learn Slovak by yourself from this book."
3,took it along,"Took the book to Europe, but never had to use it. Everyone speaks English, so unless you really want to learn Slovak (which is my heritage) you may not need it for a trip there."
2,i got bored,"i snagged this cd in 1997 based on a glowing review. after hearing it i was disappointed--i'd expected something much different, and better.since then, i've played it a few more times, off and on, always with the same result. today i played it and thought better of it than i expected, so that's new.unfortunately, this album is clearly an independent (meaning lower budget) version of front 242 and kmfdm, and is kind of boring. the synth sounds were a bit cheesy to me when i got it, and have not improved with age. while the programming is accomplished, it doesn't mean the songs are well written, and everything seems to go on much longer than one would expect, or like. maybe you'll like it, but i'm just bored."
2,A Meaningless Opinion,"Not really that great of an industrial album, some of the beats are cool but there are really no lyrics in the songs, and where there are lyrics they get drowned out by distortion and beat. Don't waste your money."
3,a brief history of the birth of the nazis,"interesting book, but of course painted with the brush in a liberal hand,,karl liebknechnt is just a gentle old man who wanted nothing more than to play with his grandchildren, how about a bloodthirsty commie who didnt care who's blood was shed in the name of world peace!!!!!also he failed to mention that in recouse to the murder of luxemberg & liebknechnt,the commies killed off all the Grand Duke's in russian,, they were murderd by more peace loving bolshevicks,,but of course any patriotic soldat fresh home from the front that put everything aside in his belief to save the fatherland from a bunch of traiters is called a bully boy or a murderer,theres a lot of history in this book.but read it a couple times through so you can pick out the corn from the crap!!"
3,The Rose's Kiss,"I had already seen and read the book ""The Rose's Kiss"" before seeing this book. The two books have so much in common, in content and even down to similarity in binding and cover colors, that one does wonder. This book is entertaining, well-written, and informative. It is often ""chatty"" in its style, which I found off-putting. It is most definitely for the lay readership and explains well how flowers work. However, it lacks an authoritative aura and seems shy in scholarly appreciation of the subject matter. Thus, it lacks the depth that is evident in the Rose's Kiss which I recommend more highly as a better read, for the same readership, than the ""Anatomy of a Rose"". Interestingly, neither book has much information on the floral biology of roses. Not surprising because few studies have been made."
4,A reference reading !,"The flowers are somehow one of the multiple faces of the inscrutable nature . The admirable shapes enlist from the erotic orchid to the sunflower .The poetry , painting , music , sculpture have empowered of them to magnify and heighten them . From Van Gogh to Rilke their sublime and brief presence has been inspiration motive to countless artists .The author offers us invaluable appreciations about the flowers poetic .The similes described in the process of pollen ritual are true poems .The flowers have drawings we can not see and reflect unthinkable colours .If the flowers wouldn't exist from the human point of view , the world would be dead .Acquire this singular essay , admirably well written and best expressed ."
2,Not good enough to buy,A few enjoyable tidbits. So-so writing and not much substance. Go with Peter Bernhardt's The Rose's Kiss.
5,Science + Beauty = Flowers,"Sharman Russell uses poetic language to explore scientific technicalities of flowers and related natural elements. Some of the more interesting facts revealed in the narrative telescope into the author's personal experiences. Against the backdrop of scientific fact, Anatomy of a Rose explores deeper issues of ecological harmony, sacred aspects of culture, and survival of species. A fascinating read, even for the least scientific of readers."
4,The secret life of flowers,"This book is more about flowers in general than rose in particular. Russell has clearly researched the subject extensively, and done a very good job of distilling that research into of 230 page book. Russell's book is a precautionary tale - as the author says only one percent of the known flowers have been fully studied, and many will become extinct before we understand them.Russell frankly discusses what the cost of this extinction to the planet and to humans means; the many plants which have medicinal purposes that will never be discovered. Also, the fact some parmaceutical companies are starting to take a keen interest in preserving the wilderness - but only because of the enormous profit potential from developing and patenting drugs made from these plants.Flowered plants can teach us a lot, and I recommend this book to any one interested in nature, the history of plants, and the role of plants in evolution."
2,Works but not as you think.,"Hi I bought this for myself and my room mate for something to do while deployed. When they got here we thought finally we can use the wireless link option on our games....WRONG! This isn't what you think it is. This adapter is a replacement to the actual link cable itself. You can use this to replace the cable itself and play from a distance from one another, but not for the wireless options on your games themselves. Basically if you want to rid yourself of the limitations of a cable this is a good item, but if not this is not the item your looking for you need the Nintendo adapter."
4,I believe this can connect to almost any wireless link model,"I havent used it with my friend's wireless link yet, so i can be sure if its universal or not."
2,GBA Wireless Link System,"Cannot get it to respond, and have not been able to use it. I am not happy about it."
5,Another great collection of episodes.,"--""The Good Old Bad Old Days"" is an intriguing episode which is based on a challenge given to Carmen that she can't pull off a crime without her technological gadgets for which she is notorius. Fast-paced and exciting, the second episode on this video, ""The Stolen Smile"" is actually the first episode of the entire television show, starting with Ivy and Zack's team being formed. It's funny with some clever jokes and interesting.--Marisa"
2,Too much misinformation,"This book is potentially misleading. It contains plenty of accurate information but enough nonsence and inaccurate information to be dangerous to those who do not have expertise in the field. You'd be better off going on line and reading information from the learned bodies on the subjects (e.g. Institute of Medicine, American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine) or just doing a PubMed search for reviews."
4,Six Feet Under - 'In Retrospect 1969-70' (Arf! Arf!),"Nineteen track CD compilation of (I'm guessing) every song this late '60's psych band ever recorded. Not SURE as to why I've seen this group described as ska on several sites - they're not ska - they're psychedelic with female vocals. Tunes here that i got the most out of were ""Freedom"", ""Running Around In The Sun"", the pretty cool sounding ""Six Feet Under"" theme, their twelve-minute cover of Iron Butterfly's ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" and both versions of ""What Would You Do?"". Line-up: Nanette Delaune - vocals, Scott Julian - guitar, Duane Ulgherait - bass, Jerry Dobb - keyboards and Tico Torres - drums. Should appeal to fans of Neighb'rhood Children, Touch, Bow Street Runners and Jefferson Airplane."
3,Not a bad mouse....,"I bought this mouse because with the rebate, it was free. I'm not a big fan of the vibrating aspect -- I tried playing an audio CD while working and the cursor just bounced all over the place -- but my son likes it when he plays his games. So when I use it I just turn off the vibration. It is a little heavy, but who's picking it up? I prefer the term ""solid"". It seems to work very well with my favorite time-wasting game, Snood, so I give it an OK rating. Actually, I'm not on the computer that much, but for my limited use, it seems to work well enough."
1,Mac users beware!,"This mouse is advertised as Mac compatible, and in a sense it is. It works as a standard mouse. However, the software driver CD that comes with the mouse is PC-only, and the drivers available for download from their website is PC-only.The wheel doesn't work on a Mac, and you can't program the buttons (they all work like a standard mouse button).If you're looking for a large, clunky mouse, however, then this is the product for you."
1,Very bad mouse,"I will give it negative star if I can.I am not saying you should not buy this mouse, but definitely I will not buy another one of this kind..."
3,it's good but...,this mouse is ok but the price is a little bit higher than my favourate like logitech
1,Don't buy American Anko or AVBTech,"This company did not send my rebate. I would not expect that they provide any warranty or support if they do not honor anything as basic and simple to fufill as a rebate. I will not be buying any other products from American Anko or AVBTech (who make this mouse, as well as gaming force-feedback wheels ). I don't if American Action is just another name American Anko uses or a distributor name, but I think I will avoid them too because of this experience. If you want a vibrating mouse, buy a Logitech iFeel, which is optical, has a better software package, and a company that stands behind their products."
3,Confusing rebate..,"The product is allright, it works as advertised...BR>I was...confused about the UPC code so I send both the bar codes in the box. I tried calling the company for verification but they never pickup the phone.The rebate check didn't come in 3 months, Neither did they send any communication.I contact them by email and they replied that the proof of purchase I had send is not good enough. I had enclosed the Amazon confirmation printout & bar codes. They replied I should have included the packaging slip as well. This was never mentioned anywhere in the rebate form. After much haggling and after sending back the packaging slip I got a partial rebate.The company is not customer friendly, so please don't buy this expecting help with product or mail in rebate..I hope...such companies [stop] taking advantage of it's valuable customers."
2,Shaky Cursors,Well this thing is simply ridonculous. I have to say it's basically pointless. Its only slightly useful for alerting you if sound is off on your computer. If you play music on your computer and have the vibration turned all the way up it can be hard to click things. I only bought it because it was free.
2,Feedback Noise,"I was excited to try this device. I am a teacher, who with years of speaking across a noisy classroom, has lost the volume needed to effectively and comfortably teach.I took it to school, put in the batteries and turned it on to try it. Immediately, I noticed that there was a feedback hum that would drive me crazy. When I tested it by speaking into the microphone, you could hear my voice, but it was not loud or full enough to project across the classroom, and the feedback noise was still audible, possibly preventing the students from hearing me.I will be returning this product and trying something that wirelessly feeds to my computer and classroom speaker system instead."
4,Unbelievable Value,"Having to teach a class in a room without a sound system after losing my voice, I was at a loss. I ""googled"" for a portable amplification system and found the Reizen Speak N Hear. At it's price I could not believe it would do the task satisfactorily. However, I could not afford to pass up the opportunity. I am amazed at it's performance. I clipped the lapel mike to my shirt and kept the amplifier-speaker around my waist. The class could hear me clearly while I just whispered. I was able to complete 18 hours of class, without my speaking voice, in just three weeks. That's an investment of less than $2 per class hour, including shipping."
5,"Great Book, Must Read","I checked this book out of my school library and couldn't put it down. It is a great read and is very interesting. It is the story of Irving Cooper, an experimental brain surgeon, and how he tries to get his research accepted by his colleagues and also how he helps so many people that thought they would be incapacitated for life. Buy this book!"
3,installed fine,"Works, what can I say? Arrived in a timely fashion. I Would recommend this item to anyone rebuilding an engine."
2,Doesn't Fit Well,"Doesn't fit well in my Kohl tank. I had to modify it so it would fit. It works so, so."
5,Phenominal Performance!,"Never before in my life has a book had the ability to move me in such a way.From the very begining I had an idea of what to expect. With each chapter reeling me in I couldn't put it down. This book truly consumed me! I laughed, I cried(sometimes at the same time). I felt for these girls and in the process found myself falling in love with their characters. They shared a bond that ran deeper than blood itself. It really made me re-examine my entire adolescence. We can all use a good friend like Lisa and Celeste in our lives. Only very few of us are lucky enough to truly capture it. These girls were gifted and way ahead of their time. It pains me, that they felt the need to travel down the roads they did, but then again that's apart of life we often have to lose ourselves in order to be found. This was hands down the best book I have read in years. I would reccommend it to any one contemplating the purchase. BUY IT! It has truly changed a part of me."
1,Why write 5 pages when 250 will do?,"Robert Slater's writing disappoints me. It disappointed me with his recent book about Donald Trump, ""No Such Thing as Overexposure"", and it disappoints me in the Martha book. It reeks of the ""let's write and publish a book as quickly as possible using secondary sources"" school which appears increasingly common in our bookstores. Slater repeats the same points over and over again, often using the same words, and in many cases within a page or two of the previous mention. Since he didn't get to interview Martha, the conjecturing and theorising about her life are, at best, superficial, and, at worst, make-believe. I am no fan of Martha Stewart as I am not into homemaking, but read the book as part of broader reading about comebacks. Slater's work contributed little to my thinking."
1,Same Old....Same Old..But???,"At least this author mentions the ""mockery"" strategy Martha/Mdiddy tried to use to ""fog"" the public. The ""real issue"" of whether Martha/Mdiddy committed the crimes, and lack of an effort to encourage an answer to the question ""DID MARTHA STEWART"" lie, demonstrates some complacency. Is it this complacency Martha/Mdiddy and her pr team try to encourage and promote? Is it the ""greyness"" of white-collar crime that Martha/Mdiddy was trying to play on? Is society the ultimate judge about a person's guilt or innocence? If so, what has Martha/Mdiddy been judged?Be ""thoughtful""~Shawn"
2,Item not as described.,"Item was described as ""Used-Like New."" Like hell. The spine is damaged, the binding is falling apart, and both front and back covers have deep scratches on it."
5,"Well written, IE same as American version",This is a well written book that goes into more detail than was necessary for my physiology class. The illustrations are clear and detailed. The chapter test questions and glossary were helpful too. I was very happy that the International Student Edition is exactly the same as the standard U.S. edition except the cover has a different picture on it and it is not a hard cover (which I prefer because it weighs less!). All the contents and page numbers are exactly the same (I compared it with my friends' books) and I saved almost $250 because I purchased the IE instead of the new US version. VERY HAPPY
2,Hate it but got to have it,"I hate this book. I had to buy it for physiology, as my teacher picked it because she says that it is a respected name in the medical field. So, if your purchasing this book for fun, I would say pass. I'm only reading it because I'm being tested on it. I usually have to look things up on the Internet for clarification and I'm not a complete idiot. I received an A in both Anatomy and Chemistry."
1,Not the Best Butterfly Book for Young Children,"I purchased four books on butterflies for the first grade class that I adopted and unfortunately this was the WORST book by far! It had about 20 written pages, but the information just wasn't that great.What bothered me the most was that the book ended so abruptly. It just said not to touch a butterfly's wings. If they cannot fly, they will die. What kind of ending is that for a children's book??!Believe it or not, one of the absolute BEST books on butterflies is from the Cat in the Hat series, ""My, Oh My - a Butterfly!"" It had the very best information, as well as a great rhyming pattern!""The Very Hungry Caterpillar Pop-Up Book"" was very cute too.I'm sorry, but save your money with this book. I just can't recommend it at all!"
3,videos,"My grandson loves anything Mario. This is a 3 disc set; however, I was disappointed that the 3rd disc doesn't work. He watches the first two all the time. We haven't watched the Hedgehog dvd yet."
2,Book Is Too Basic for the Price-No Editing Advice,"This book is written at a very basic level, and the subject matter is better covered by Deni Bown's book ""101 Essential Tips on Video"" at one-third the price. I was looking for advice on the best techniques for editing my videos using my camcorder and a VCR. Fuller dismisses the idea of editing, claiming that most people are too lazy to edit their work, so they end up with ""2-hour videos of Junior's birthday party,"" etc., which gather dust in a drawer because they're ""too long to watch."" People who are that lazy aren't likely to have the discipline to learn and follow his methods, which amount to planning and shooting the finished product as you go ""in the camcorder"", without allowing for errors which could be edited out later when you make copies with the VCR."
1,GARBAGE,"No matter what you're thinking this ""tool"" would be good for; DON'T BUY IT. The blades are too weak and hard to find in a store."
3,"Beautiful, but monotonous","I heard a track from this album and was absolutely mesmerized by it. I ordered this album immediately as a result. Pick any one track from this album and you, too, will be mesmerized. The thing is, each song involves so much repetition that 30 seconds into the second one you listen to, you will be weary of the monotony--like being trapped in an elevator with a never-ending sound track. My suggestion would be to download one or two of your favorite tracks and play them mixed in with other artists to avoid the feeling of unending repetition, rather than purchasing the whole CD."
1,Derivative warm mush,Music for the unmusical minded.Very boring simple annoying contrived piano playing like a bad Windenham Hill album. don't touch it with a barge pole. if I could give it no stars I would.
2,don't know who is this book for,"If you are a new comer, you can find better, basic books. If you are pro or amateur, you should already know everything written in this book. So who need this book?"
3,Book about gear not photographing technique,"Lion portion of the material is about different Nikon gears author used, covers in details different types of lenses, accessories, filters and flashes, but really very little if any material on photographing technique.I personally have found ""Digital Landscape Photography: In the Footsteps of Ansel Adams and the Masters"" by Michael Frye much more usefulhttp://www.amazon.com/Digital-Landscape-Photography-Footsteps-Masters/dp/0240812433/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1296504431&sr;=1-1"
5,Excellent book for beginners!,This is an excellent book for budding photographers. John Shaw explains the fundamentals of photography lucidly and clearly with his own photographs along with nice anecdotes.This book is just worth for it's great pictures!Great piece of work!!It is a great value for the money. Just buy it!
5,Great book but fairly basic.,"Before reading this book, I knew very little about photography and how it really worked. This book has inspired me through the wonderful pictures and the easy to follow language that Shaw uses to describe everything. The concepts that Shaw discusses are not really advanced by any means, but he teaches to you in a way that you can understand how things work and you are able to make decisions based upon the basics that he will teach you. If you are an advanced photographer, this book may not be for you. However, just the pictures alone nearly made up for the cost of this book for me. The pictures were beautiful and inspiring. This is a wonderful book for a beginner, and even after you move on to more advanced ideas...this book will still be a great piece to have just to look at! Buy it!"
5,My First Photography Book,"I knew how to focus, point, and shoot, but I didn't know aperture, f-stop, shutter speed, exposure values, film speed or how these things could affect the pictures I take. Just after the first chapter, I understood more about my camera and the purpose of all of its options (and I'm using a Sony digital Mavica). John Shaw takes the time to explain what you need to know without getting too technical. And all of his many incredible photos throughout the book include descriptive captions of how he took the photo. Each photo emphasizes the point he is making.This book was excellent for me as a beginner and includes many techniques for outdoor photography. I enjoy the humourous tone, particularly when explaining technical points.The images are fantastic. Even if you don't read it, the book makes an excellent coffee table addition!"
5,Excellent book for the serious amateur or professional,"John Shaw's photographs are amazing and inspiring and this book would be worth purchasing just for the images. Fortunately, however, this is book is not just a glorified portfolio but an excellent guide to every aspect of nature photography. The book is comprehensive without sacrificing detail.John Shaw provides specific advice and detailed guidelines for photographing nature subjects. Where most books are vague, the author recommends specific equipment to purchase, when to use it and when to avoid it.Be advised, however, that though this book has excellent information for any level of photographer, it is most useful for the advanced amateur or professional. Some of his recommendations are beyond the capabilities of a beginner -- technically and financially. For example, his recommendations of the type of equipment to buy for high quality images would probably bankrupt a hobbyist.Again, the information is priceless and the images without equal."
2,Anachronism,"This is listed as the ""updated edition."" That is true but it was updated almost a decade ago in 2000, which explains why the book is based on film photography. It is also a beginner's book almost entirely devoted to hardware and equipment as is stated by the author in the preface: This is a book about John Shaw's cameras, lenses, tripods, and film. It is not a book about capturing great nature photos. If you don't know about aperture, speed, ISO, or depth of field as applied to 35mm film cameras then this book is for you. If you are looking for guidance on the techniques used to capture great outdoor photography you are advised to look elsewhere."
4,John Shaw's Nature photography field guide,I was hoping to learn more about how to take nature photos that make everyone else love what I was enjoying at the time of taking that photo. This book is really good.
3,Purchased for 9yr old new LOST IN SPACE fan,"My daughter 9, is a new Lost In Space fan. A new generation that wasn't there for the run on TV, incredible! She loves the Robot (B9) and Dr Smith so she wanted a toy. There just isnt any toy under about $50, they are all collectibles. I found the Polar Lights model kit and bought it. Reasonably priced too! We built the kit together an I painted it for her. Expect to spend about $10 on paints brushes and glue. We put it together over a two day vacation and it was very easy to put together. As a long time modeler I would say this isn't the best quality of model kits. Some of the pieces are a bit funky, like the treads stick out way too far compared to the real robot, but things like that are small. Overall it is a fun little model, and my daughter got her B9 and loves it.It was shipped very quickly and came well packed."
5,Awesome!!,I bought this for my father in law for Christmas and he loved it!!! I am now his favorite daughter in law!! :)
4,Cute with Christmas memories,"I purchased this for my invalid mother-in-law to have in her room and perk her up during the Christmas season. It's an electronic music box featuring holiday songs plus popular songs from the early and mid 1900s, making this special to her. The tree is very colorful with its lights and the train going around it brings back all kinds of good memories for her. The wood looks good. It has an on/off switch, runs on batteries but will take an electric adapter and has a volume control so you can vary the volume to your taste. My mother-in-law likes it."
4,Game collection enthusiasm,"I took a look at this package and for the cost and the titles that you get, it is an extreme value. Each of these games themselves cost $29.99 at the store and here you can get 4 games for $29.99. I love the Ultimate Yahtzee. You get 4 different versions to play off the classic game. Monopoly is great, it just takes awhile to get used to the computer version. It beats worrying about the money, it takes care of that for you. Trivial Pursuit is good, I am a big fan of this game and it is the same as the board game. I absolutely love Sorry. If you liked these games as a kid, you can't go wrong with the cost and the extreme quality of this collection."
2,Self-indulgent and stupid,Miss Gatto needs to stick to journal writing (privately please) and spare us her dramatic drivel.
3,A bit overwrought,"Gatto's writing is raw and unpolished. In time, she may have something to say and even say it competently, but this book reads like the diary of a tortured adolescent. Very self-conscious."
2,not very good,"Apparently a bit of a legend in her own mind, Gatto overwrites and buries the core of some good themes."
2,I wrote this kind of crap when I was 16,"I bought this book for all the wrong reasons -- somebody told me the author was a sex activist, so I ordered the book. Guess I should have realized that sex activism and writing are very different pursuits. Not worth the money."
2,a total downer -- waste of money,this author doesn't write all that well and doesn't say anything profound. pretty hackneyed stuff.
1,Quite dull,"Rather dull for what it promises, much overwritten, much in need of a good editor, with parts of it just unreadable. Avoid."
2,Turgid Writing,"While the subject is fascinating, the writing puts me to sleep. Phrases like ""self taught enthusiast"" make me want to stop reading, and the prose just doesn't flow. Finishing this book, if I do, will be a chore. I'd rather have my twenty bucks back; save yours. If I get to like this book better as I read, I'll revise my review."
4,Not long enough!!!,"That's right, it's not long enough! That's why I've given this 4 stars instead of 5; it's just a teaser.'Plasticity' is a hard hitting, aggressive tune with some razor sharp, deep cutting synth work. This is the fastest work I think Bill's ever put out! To me it almost seems like a remix of a song off of Hard Wired, due to the extreme familiarity of some parts of the song.But I think the real star here is the dark 'Replicant' which is almost old-school FLA. I love this song! If you like songs from Caustic Grip era, mixed with a little Millenium style sounds, you'll love this one!Then you've got the 'Zero' remix from Haujobb of 'Plasticity'. I'm not a huge Haujobb fan, but this remix is not bad.I think that perhaps this CD was released to bridge the gap between 'Hard Wired' and 'FLAvor Of The Weak' and make the latter a little more easy to accept. No matter what, Bill Leeb still remains a genius."
2,psche,"Plasticity seems at first a song they should have forgotten to include in Hard Wired; but the beat is more danceable and then, mainly after listening to Flavour of the weak, everything is explained, even if Fulber was still here and not Peterson yest. The problem with this song is the voice: it's weird but not cool for me. I don't exactly like Leeb's voice, but on this song I abhor it. Besides, the song is not very original; the other song is as mediocre that one understands why it's not included in any album. Not even the samples from the film 'Cronos', with Federico Luppi's moaning (one of the best actors I've ever seen) can save the song. Leeb and co were a bit stagnated at this time, actually."
4,MF Doom opens the gates..,"If you loved KMD, or the subsequent releases by Zev Love X, or MF Doom, or whatever he wants to call himself, this album may be right up your alley. With chaotically sample heavy beats that are worthy of their own instrumental album (*ahem*), the M.I.C. crew takes turns spitting non sequitur/street edged raps that remain just fresh enough to keep you riveted without having to think about anything other than the gritty and seamlessly good beats that house this album.While more lyrical heads may not be feeling it, this album is a definite buy for heads who love a well produced and original sound."
5,Very unique album,"No need to explain, if your into rhyming and individualism ""cop this"" haha... (7 more words required)PS:DIG IT!"
3,"Concept rich, but lack luster","This album had everything going for it, but it fell flat. The psudo sequel of MF Doom's (King Gidera) ""Take Me To Your Leader"" was a much better LP than this effort.The LP's stand out tracks are obviously the ones produced by Doom and the dopest cut ""1,2 1,2"" was recycled on Ghostface's ""Fishscale"" LP as the Wu-Tang reunion possie cut.Bottom line, the two emcees you want to hear are mostly absent. Doom hardly blesses us with his gift of gab and Grimm is 100% absent due to him being in jail when this was being recorded. And where's Kurious Jeorge? I thought he was down? Uber low budget mics, so-so beats and the main ingredient that everyone wants is missing. Dissapointing, but in a year or two, those of you who purchased it will probably be able to resale it on e-bay for a ton of cash."
2,Not that good...,"All in all, I was really dissapointed; I really enjoyed the King Geedorah album. I thought the King Geedorah album boasted stellar, thematic, production, tolerable skits, and street-wise but deep lyrical content.Doom is on the boards for about 1/3 of the tracks on 'Escape...' All have the stereotypical Doom sound, with the only standout being '1,2...1,2.' The X-ray produced tracks are minimal, but generally sound stiff, lacking much of a groove - thin synth lines, few sampled melodies. I did like 'Warning (Kong),' which has a nice, minimal, dark groove.The lyrical flows have a classic New York sound, pretty good. Lyrical content is pretty bad, unless you enjoy repetitious rhymes about smoking weed and women riding my d$&*."
5,Good product and good buy,wonderful product with a good price. Delivery was prompt and all in all a good transaction. I highly recommend.
5,"good product, fast shipping",quality product for half the price. This stylus works perfectly and the pack comes with 3. Thank you.
3,It Works,"I was just looking for a replacement stylus for my Treo 700wx. This doesn't exactly match the stock stylus, but it works and fits very well. As for the pen feature, I never use it; it's just too slim and tiny for me. Plus, I'm not a big fan of that style ball (I normally write with a Pilot Precise V5 or V7 black), though the included pen does seem to be a decent quality.By the way, to get to the pen attachment, you must unscrew its cap (the stylus' tip), which is tiny and easy to drop once detached."
3,A practical need,"While this has dropped in price since introduction it is still a high price for just adding the functionality of a pen. But because Palm never had that fore-sight, we must pay. It functions well in emergencies, but would not recommend for long writing periods."
3,"Works, but Stylus lacks Style!","These stylii serve the same function as any other, but be forewarned: it is not identical to the one that comes with your Treo 650. Whereas the stylus that comes with the phone is uniformly silver, this one has black plastic on both ends. Not a huge deal, but they do look a bit cheaper than the one you had."
1,Not as represented,"What I received was not the OEM Palm Treo 700p stylus as represented or pictured. The OEM stylus that had come with the Palm Treo 700p fit snugly into the side of the Treo and had a removable tip in case the unit needed to be rebooted. The stylus that I received did not have a removable tip and has too small a diameter, so that it easily falls out of the Treo. Not recommended for Palm Treo 700p users."
3,oops,I bought this by mistake because it came up in the listing under Palm Centro. See if someone can place it in the correct category. I didn't realize till I had opened the package. Anyone want to buy an opened package?
3,It was ok,"It's an ok book if you're a total novice with Powerpoint, but there was litte that was new to more regular users."
3,A Different Use of a Great Tool,As an abbreviation of my old review for this book: This book is not good enough. The new version for PowerPoint 2007 is much better. It's a true five-star book. I wouldn't bother with this one myself and I've been building PowerPoint slides and giving presentations more than 125 times per year for the past 11 years.
5,Beyond Boring Presentations,"I live in PowerPoint. I think in PowerPoint. I'm good at PowerPoint and I help a number of companies I work with do a better job of their PowerPoint pitches. Unlike many who hate the product I love it. And I thought I had very little left to learn. Wow, was I wrong. Cliff Atkinson does a great job, not just pushing you to be more creative and bold with your presentations but actually helping you get there more easily. It is a really easy book to follow. I also encourage any ready to go to his website ""beyondbullets.com"" to see more of his ideas in color."
2,Maybe Not,"For those wanting the add FX to their PP presentations - this isn't the book. The PP stuff is 101 level. For those looking for a format for their presentations - this offers one. Will it fit all, or even most, circumstances? Not in my experience of coaching business presentations for 20 + years."
2,PowerPoint waffle,I thought that this book was going to lead me through how to use the mighty PowerPoint software but that's a minor part of it. It concentrates on how to design a presentation... not the technical side which I was seeking. It waxes lyrical about story boards but doesn't tell me how to insert a video.Maybe I just misinterpreted the title but I was disappointed.
2,Promising but ultimately disappointing,"The message of this book is simple: tell a story with your PowerPoint slides. Sound like a great idea---and it is---but not very practical. Most of the clients for whom I work WANT bullets and, in fact, the delivery of the type of information they supply is bullet-summary stuff.So the real challenge I've faced with clients is to take standard bullet slides and make them interesting, informative, attractive and conceptual. I was hoping that this book would bring new insights and suggestions to that challenge. Not so.Also, this book screams for more examples...tons of them, in fact. Many ""before and after"" examples would be extremely valuable. And a web site with real-life examples and ideas might just persuade me to abandon ""bullets"" and take up storytelling."
3,Great book for the salesman!,Not bad. Wished I had read it 10 years ago but it has really helped me when I am forced to do a powerpoint presentation. I would have my sales team read it for sure!
5,Must have resource for effective presentations,Written very well with many useful ideas for story telling and effective transitions for greater presentation impact!Sunil GuptaBest Selling Author and Global TrainerGupta Programming
5,Must read for trial lawyers,This book is a must read for anyone using PowerPoint for presentations - especially lawyers who can't afford to bore jurors with uninteresting or unimportant information.
5,"a very, very helpful book on creating effective presentations","While I didn't adopt the 3 > 3 approach Atkinson suggests, I really took to heart his idea of replacing wordy, boring slides with those with only a title (a concept, expressed as a sentence) and high-impact relevant graphics. As a result, I created a six-hour workshop (on personal productivity) that contained a total of five bullets (out of 130 slides). I also created - from the same slide show - a prose booklet that participants take home. Very useful.More at: What a difference a framework can makehttp://ideamatt.blogspot.com/2007/04/what-difference-framework-can-make.html"
5,An Essential,"I've created PowerPoints for executives in major corporations and national non-profits for years now, and this is one of the first books I suggest anyone who needs to create their own PowerPoint look to. Beyond Bullet points is accessable enough that the novice PowerPoint user can understand what's going on and use the lessons in his or her next presentation; it's also detailed and challenging enough that even an old salt like me can find things to learn and do. Don't be another person who stands on stage reading their PowerPoint, and don't let reading your slides distract the audience from your presentation; follow the suggestions in this book and wow your audience."
2,A disappointment,"I thought there would be much more content. I was already aware of the concept of forming a presentation using a story arc, so there wasn't much new that I can use."
2,Make sure you buy the 2007 edition!!!!,"I bought the book, enjoyed it and then realized that I hasd purchased the 2005 edfition and not the new 2007 edition. be careful as the new one is much better. Amazon should have made this clear!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,We were very happy,Our clock arrived in perfect working condition in time for my parents surprise party. I was very pleased with the service we received!
5,Amazing!,"This is a remarkable CD that you can listen to all the way thorugh. Every song is amazing. THis is one of my favorite CD's I always listen to it when I am on a road trip. ""Somthing New"" has such variety, each song is an individual thought and they all sound different. Amber has one of the most captivating voices I have every heard. You won't regret buying this CD."
5,one of the more educational episodes,"I acknowledge the flaw pointed out by another reviewer that going around with a magnifying glass looking at things does not exactly constitute an experiment, but it's easy to forgive that since there are so many other good things in this video. This is my personal favorite, and my three and a half son loves it too. As a result, we've had to reenact the cyclone experiment and traipse around with a magnifying glass. The planets song is the highlight of the whole tape: a fun, catchy way to remember them all."
5,Very cute!,I liked this video very much. I thought that this was a great way to learn about science and the Planets in our solar system! I loed the Super Steve and Super Blue bit! I hope that more tapes like this come out. I have this one and the Pajama Party one.
4,I would buy it again.,"I bought this becuase the battery life on the standard battery was pretty lousy. If I left my blackberry 7520 off charge for one night, I was in trouble. The 1500 mah battery provides much more life. It stills needs to be charged every night, but I never come close to running out of battery during the day. I have the nextel feature and use the speakerphone extensively. The oversized door that came with it, is a little bit flimsier than the one made by RIM, but it is adequate. You can tell it is an aftermarket cover and doesn't fit perfenctly but I am just nit-picking their. This is a solid purchase."
5,Blackberry Battery,"It is good to be able to get a battery for your older but wonderful Blackberry and this was a very good price, and I did not have to wait for it forever. I was very pleased to say the least."
3,A Striking Look into Afghan culture,"The book was difficult to put down as I felt I was deeply entrenched into the unfortunate daily life of a typical Afghan family. Fascinating but sad, the book did a good job opening my eyes to the hardships of Afghan society."
4,A unique perspective on a closed society,"Right after the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan, Asne Seierstad, a Western journalist and a woman, was allowed to move into Sultan Khan's home. Khan is a successful bookseller, cunning businessman, but also a strict Muslim who rules his family with a strict hand. The book opens with Seierstad's description of an Afghan wedding and immediately we can see the differences from our Western culture. Seierstad takes us on a journey detailing the daily struggles and fears of various family members that no doubt represent the Afghan nation. Although the Taliban had fallen, the deplorable treatment of women and the fear ingrained in the minds of the people were still visible scars of a land in turmoil. To better understand today's headlines and the world around us, this international bestselling book is a must."
5,Hard life for women in Kabul,"Please read this book to see how unlucky those women are, how little they can do for themselves. They are so scared of outside world, so they just obey and continue. please read this book to see a peak of their lives."
3,Interesting but somehow lacking,"It is a very readable book though one must keep in mind that it's a purported portrait of one Afghan family. I do not agree that it panders to Western ideas of society, it's just inevitable for us to read information through cultural blinkers and our personal understanding of society and how relationships work. It is thus natural for the author to feel what she does about the Afghan society where the male plays a dominating role. Not sure about where the author gets information on the thoughts and feelings of the characters but I think she has done a good job in expressing the frustration and I actually enjoyed reading the book after going through the dreadful preface where the author seemed more intent on talking about herself than the content of the book. Interesting concept, but there is something seriously missing, perhaps sincerity."
3,Informational but lacks a story,"This book is written well and provides a good glimpse into the life of Afghan people. It is sad to learn about how women live in Afghanistan and it is sadder to know that it is not likely to change -- even with the change in regime, etc.While the book is a good read and focuses on the family of Sultan, the bookseller -- it fails to bring it to a conclusive end. Its almost like hearing about 10 different individuals and then abrubtly stopping the book. So from that point of view, the book was dissapointing.I still do think that the book is good and it highlights the life and customs of Afghan people. It is an eye opener and factual book rather than a story."
5,"Excellent, very easy read.","I was very impressed with this book. It was an easy read but showed so much of Afghan culture. While at times I felt angry it also gave me a hunger to learn more about this intriguing country. I felt the author gave an excellent recounting of what she had seen and heard.Unlike some of the other reviewers I did not feel that she was attacking Sultan Khan personally. She was merely showing the society that he was raised in and how this has shaped how he handles his family and the people around him.This book made me angry, laugh, cry and most of all made me grateful for the freedoms I have as a woman in western society."
3,Mediocre Portrayal of Afghan Life,"Many people will pick up The Bookseller of Kabul and like it because it portrays the stereotypical version of how Westerners view Afghan family life. Buy what they won't know is the rich and diverse history of this land, and the fact that while the Khan family may have been presented accurately, their experience is not necessarily reflective of an entire population.I found my position as a resident of Kabul to definitely impact how I read this book. I was often frustrated at how the author didn't always contextualize the history of the place and people she was writing about, and I did not think the book was very literary in its style (though, as one reviewer noted, this could be a translator's fault). For people who want a more varied (and accurate) view of Afghanistan, I'd suggest picking up Christina Lamb's The Sewing Circles of Herat instead."
5,Wonderful Book!,This turned out to be a wonderful book. I bought it without knowing a lot of its contents but reading The Bookseller of Kabul was entirely satisfying. I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand and lived with a couple of Thai families. I can identify with being the outside observer and could relate to the anger I felt when there was a clash of a cultural beliefs. I was never more hopping mad in my life. There is something totally disorienting about living with people from another culture in their country. Most people who visit other countries do nothing more than hang out in tourist areas and have little contact with the people who live there. Anse Sierstad has provided Westerners with her valuable experience.
1,Author's limited information about the culture,"From an Afghan point of view, it seems to me that the author had very limited knowledge of the culture, and not understanding the language made it worst. She describes the Booksellers' life ""as a glass half empty"" she is ignoring all the love and kindness. She has indicated in her book that the bookseller said to her family to take care of the author otherwise they will be punished....this is a very common sentence used by Afghans...it doesn't mean that the author will really punish the family members.....this shows the hospitality of Afghan people, not of their brutality. As an Afghan I would never let someone like the author to stay in any Afghan home...for she needs to travel around the world and understand different cultures before she takes her pen next. Very unprofessional work!!"
3,This book is depressing-,"This book is written by a journalist who was able to live with an Afghanie family in Kabhul, Afganistan. She was able to witness the entire workings of a ""regular"" family.The man, Sultan, has two wives and many children and how this affects the family structure, plus, how it affects the two women. The family also lives with Sultan's mother, sisters, and brothers and how the women have to take care of the family.Sultan owns a book shop where he keeps books of old Afghan culture and stories. The story takes place right after the Taliban's regime crumbled. The women still wear their burkas in town and how even though the Taliban has left, how some old habits from them still stay the same.The book is mostly stories and common events that go on within this family.I thought the book was good, and the places and events were well defined.Ellen"
2,Boring,I would do a sample reading if you are considering purchasing this book it didn't hold my interest despite sticking with it till mid range.
5,"Great Book, Great Quality","The novel ""The Bookseller of Kabul"" brings the reader to the different households of Afghanistan and Pakistan; countries with very diverse cultures and traditions. I'm quite thankful with the perfect quality and safe shipping of the book."
4,just because you're educated doesn't mean you're fair to women,"This book was chosen by my women's bookclub because it was a chance to know more about daily life in Afghanistan. THe author had met an outgoing and ecumenical bookseller in Kabul, and he invited her to come live in his family and write about them. She did, and you'll fall in love with some of these people - but not the bookseller. Turns out he's greedy and will do anything for a buck. He's educated but sees no value in educating his children - he puts then to work in his shops instead. You'll love the description of the women going to the markets to shop, clad in their burkas - and the fancy footwear that distinguishes one blue form from another. Turns out the bookseller didn't like his portrayal and filed suit against the author - don't think he has a leg to stand on. Great book, quick read."
3,An insight into a different world,"We hear so much about Pakistan and Afghanistan that you can almost begin to think you know something about both countries and their incredible histories, but this book brings such a fascinating insight that you quickly realise how little you know or understand. Norwegian journalist, Asne Seiestrad, spent several months living with a family in Kabul and has woven their stories into a beautiful narrative. It is a particularly moving insight into the lives of the women of Kabul. While the conflict between the author and subject is an additional and complicating layer, this is definitely worth a read."
3,Very interesting,"I am only about half way through, but I'm enjoying this true story. It will make you glad to be able to read when you learn how restrictive some governments are concerning what citizens are allowed to see in print. Lucky for the government, most of the population is illiterate. Recommended reading."
2,"Great Fiction, Questionable Reality","Sometimes the best fiction is that which is grounded in some degree of reality. If Asne Seierstad is looking to write a wonderful fiction novel, a novel that reflects more of her journalistic intuition than reality, then she has succeeded.If she was attempting to write a reasoned, insightful, factual account of her time in Afghanistan, she failed miserably.This book reifies all the comfortable, consumable stereotypes about Afghanistan and the Afghan people that exist in our media. Men bad, women good. End of story. No accounting for ethnic differences across the diverse landscape of Afghanistan, no accounting for differences in religious belief, no accounting for socioeconomic conditions.Setting aside the brutal truth that this book laughably fails at being serious, it's a good story. Just take it for what it is: A nice piece of fiction grounded in the gritty reality of post-Taliban Afghanistan."
1,Disturbing,"This book describes the culture of a family in Kabul. I know it's important to understand the truth about the world, but after reading about 3/4 of the book I decided to stop. I found the descriptions of violence and sexual abuse too disturbing. For me personally, is was too sad and depressing. If you are like me, read ""Three Cups of Tea"" for a more uplifting book about Afghanistan."
2,not very exciting,"The bookseller of Kabul from Asne Seierstad.Even before I could finish the lecture of the book - I stay around the midle -I can say that the book is readable but not exciting, outstanding piece or something really especial. To be honest I expected something more from a so exciting issue especially from a person who live this advanture in the first line. I cannot see the soul of the book anywhere."
3,PASSABLE,It was a good read but not a gripping story. It flowed well and was very factual. There was no deep conection from one character to the other. There was no emotion shown by any family memebers. They all lived very much away from one aonther rather then with each other. They only family memeber that had feelings was Laila and she was treated unfairly by all the other family memebers. Treating her with disrespect and the countless demands were dificult for her to deal with. THey didn't allow her to teach nor allow her to stand up to herself.I felt Sultan was a unfair man and it is was his way or no way at all. If you disagreed with him then the other family members had to get out. This lead to the family splitting up at then end.There was most definately a lack of trust between them all.
3,Into the depths of an Afghanistan family,"Overall a good book. Though it's not the most captivating book I've ever read, it does a really good job of depicting real life for women in Afghanistan. And the basic oppressions of tradition, religion, society, etc. that effect the entire population as a whole, not just women. I found the book to be useful in its very ""underground"" view of life in Afghanistan, looking through the eyes of an outsider. If you're interested in Afghanistan, read this book, it's worthwhile."
5,Definitely a woman's view.,"The women are treated worst than slaves. Young unmarried girls are forbidden to have any romantic feelings. Expressing them could cost them their life. Men can do little wrong.A young wife is rumored to have committed adultry so her mother sends her three brothers to murder her. They blame it on a household accident. No police, no investigation, she was a woman.Even with the Taliban driven out, it is the family unit that brutalizes the women not the goverment.The women wear the same clothes for months. After a weekly trip to the communal bath they put the same clothes back on. The hygene is primitive. A fourth of the new-born children die in their first year.And this story is of an relatively wealthy and progressive family.You must read this book."
3,An interesting and informative book,"All of us who love books can relate to Khan. I can't imagine a life without books. Khan is very heroic in defying the various regimes of Afghanistan by selling books, despite the consequences. He is imprisoned and tortured, all because he wants to distribute books to fellow Afghans. The history and complexities of the Khan family dynamics is well portrayed. The subordinate status of Afghan women is very sad but the author who is a foreigner seems to have no such problems and men easily talk to her which seems strange. Although Khan is not a very likeable character, I wanted to know more about him because his story alone was more compelling. That said, the author did a good job of writing people's characteristics and mannerisms. They are vivid in the readers mind."
5,Great book,I really enjoyed reading this book because first of all it is very well written and secondly because it gives an authentic glimpse into the life of an Afghan family and what it is like to live in Afghanistan. I highly recommend this book.
3,Worth the read.,"I'm not unhappy to have read this book; it gave me some insight into a part of the world that I would otherwise know little about. But it is depressing in the extreme, and I suspect that it is one book I may never re-read. Further, in spite of the author's best efforts (wearing a burka, living as much as possible like an Afghan woman), it must be kept in mind that her presense, while never referred to in the book after the first chapter or two (the book is written as if the author was an omniscient but invisible spirit watching the family from their midst, aware of their inmost thoughts and concerns but having absolutely no effect upon them) could not HELP but affect them. It would have been more honest to include her own presense in her descriptions, even if it would have failed to describe the life of the family when they DIDN'T have a Western observer living with them."
4,Insightful look into Afghan culture,"The Bookseller of Kabul truly gives a representation of an Afghan family, shortly after 9/11. The book provides information that may never have been glimpsed had the author not lived with the family. Truly an intriguing, sad, shocking, emotional book. I highly recommend it."
3,Breach of confidence,The book is a good insider look from one Western woman's perspective of the oppressed and horrid lives of women in Kabul. What is inexcusable is the author's breach of her host's privacy and the abuse of that hospitality.The ignorance of the author's familiarity with the languages of the people she reports on is also astounding.The book is not all bad though in that indeed the female populace of Afghanistan is in a state of pepetual victimization and the book points that out.
3,"Sad, but true.","This book is disjointed at spots and doesn't connect you to the characters, BUT it does give a great snapshot of life in Afghanistan and the deprivation that the people there are living in. It is so sad. Our book club had a GREAT discussion because of this book. Some books that aren't the greastest literary-wise are still wonderful books for book club and this is one of them. Take notes while you read, because there are tons or places and people to keep track of."
2,The cover belies the content,"While I ""kinda"" liked this book, I was disappointed. It was less about the ""heroic"" bookseller the cover blurb describes and more about his weary, war-torn, and ruled over family. I found him to be less sympathetic by the end of the book than I originally wanted to. I will probably never understand the Afghani-Muslim culture in this part of the world and like as not ever read this book again. I understand that Sultan Khan has printed his own ""rebuttal"" book about this life. When it drops down from $30 to a lot less, I might buy it. Apparently he writes his own description of the book. ""There once was a bookseller from Kabul"" I believe the title to be. He appears to be very angry over Ms. Seierstad's book."
2,Unimpressed.,"I did not particularly enjoy reading this novel, simply because I didn't come away with anything. After finishing the book, the only thing that I gained was insight on how this particular family lived from day-to-day. I also want to clarify that this particular Afghan family was extremely oppressive and this is not how the majority of Muslim families are like-in fact, the behavior of the characters and their attitudes towards women is extremely backward and is not what Islam teaches. Based on some of the other reviews, it seems that the author did not do a good job clarifying this point. This novel is not in any way reflective of the ""modern day Muslim world"", as indicated in one of the reviews below. If you want to read a novel/journal about the life of one particular Afghan family through the eyes of a foreigner, then read this book, but do not expect to come away with much more than that."
3,A brief comment from a novice student,"This book was required reading for a class I took recently. The subject is new to me and generally speaking the chapters are clearly written. Since I am a novice at the subject of human development, I'm not in a position to evaluate the quality of the information. However, I do have one major criticism: the book has NO INDEX. Hence, if you need to locate a certain reference, you're on your own."
4,This book told important stories.,I totally disagree with the reader from San Diego. This book was not just to manipulate emotions. I believe that he was trying to tell the story of people who would have otherwise never been known to exist. It is important to know that they do exist. Time and chance is all that stands between them and us.
4,"No sugar coated Mexican cliches here, just the sad truth.","Brilliant read, by a heroically courageous soul. If you are aspiring to learn more about Mexican reality, read this book. Highly recommended."
3,A Moving account of life on the borderlands,I was impressed by how hard the times were on the mexicn border. This was a really mooving account of a desperate people's struggle for freedom.
4,interesting,"Well written. I wanted to learn what border towns are like and this books gives a gritty, realistic picture. Not a feel good story but how good it be?"
2,I was touched but not moved.,"I had to read a novel for my Latin Literature unit in my world lit class. At random I chose to read Across the Wire. My intrest was sparked beacuse the setting of the novel was just down the road from me. I was aware of the tragedies and the poverty that the people faced in Mexico and in TJ. However, I do believe that this book was not written to inform others of the bad fortunes of its charachters. I believe it was written only to gain sympathy for those that are suffering. The book's agenda was simply to make us feel guilty for all the blessing that we have in America and take for granted. However if enjoy books that play with your emotions and make you feel bad for working hard for what you have than this book is for you."
1,Not an objective look,The specific examples used are to illustrate what the author wants us to believe. I would have prefered a much rounder picture of the border. ... offers no alternatives to the reader but to take Mexico's problems off their hands and solve them with our generosity.
4,Pretty Boring But Essential,"This is probably not the most exciting read, but I do need to read it for a Review that I have due. Really boring, but necessary and informative."
4,Adesso win-touch,"I just got this keyboard and absolutely love it. Types beautifully (great keypad), and so comfortable to use. Makes keyboarding so much easier and more comfortable."
4,Fascinating,If you are into learning about the dealings of the financial markets and like detailed information that can get complex this is s agreat book
4,A solid album by Evil's Toy,"After hearing the more recent albums of Evil's Toy first, I was a bit skeptical as to how I would regard XTC Implant. But I shouldn't have worried, because it has an addictive sound of it's own. The beats of the songs here are faster than those found on Human Refuse, Morbid Mind, and the more recent Angels Only!. If you have heard Illusion, you know pretty much what to expect. If you are a long time Evil's Toy fan and do not yet have this album for some reason, go ahead and purchase it. If you are unfamiliar with Evil's Toy, I recommend having a listen to Angels Only!, which is in my opinion their best release."
1,doesn't work,"I got one of these to hook up to my 19"" widescreen high-def monitor and these do not work"
4,One of the greats...,"I would rate this book up there with ""the greats"" on the Ripperology reference shelf. Mr. Edwards did an excellent job of organizing his thoughts along with the case facts, making this a very easy and pleasant read. It definitely changed my perspective on how I view certain pieces of evidence in the Ripper murders, (which I won't mention so as to not spoil this book). This is a must read for any person with a greater than normal interest in the case. While I personally don't agree with all of Mr. Edwards theories regarding the ""rituals"", I do feel that a strong case has been built to show that D'Onston was most likely the infamous Jack the Ripper."
4,the fabric of a man,GOOD MOVIE/PLAY NOT GREAT ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 5 IT WAS A 3 AND A HALF GOOD CONCEPT YET BY THE TIME YOU START TO ENJOY IT ITS OVER SOMEWHAT STEROTYPICAL WOMAN PICKS WRONG MAN WHILE MR. RIGHT IS THEIR WAITING ALMOST LIKE MR. 3000 IN ITS ENDING YOU JUST KNOW HOW ITS GOING TO END HUMOR IS NOT CRUDE THE WHOLE FAMILY CAN WATCH IT
3,Not as good as I'd hoped . . .,"I enjoy David Talbert, but felt like this one lacked something. Can't put my finger on it though, just something that didn't work for some reason."
4,Written from the male perspective!,"This book is written for women from the male perspective! I found it to be very helpful as far as helping me get and stay into the correct mindset for dating.How many times have you fellow female daters wanted to know what's going on inside a mans' head before your first date together? And what about afterwards? How about just trying to understand what goes on inside a mans' head in regards to dating, period?Don't put all your eggs in one basket, ladies! Have the guys lined up to take you out and you'll fair much better in the dating game. Don't take things so seriously and have fun. If one doesn't turn out to be Mr. Right...there are plenty more where that came from. Don't even focus on finding Mr. Right! Live for the moment and learn from your dating experiences.Confidence is a big factor and dating lots of eligible men will definitely give you plenty of that! Can't find lots of men? This book will tell you how."
3,MEN!!!... In a few easy lessons...,"A business plan of love that needs another once over. This offering is more direct and insightful than their previous book, but it exhibits a point of view that may be too narrow when it comes to attracting men who don't fit into certain cookie cutter criteria. My advice is to make the romance fit the man, because not all men are fit for romance. Also, there are men who will rebel and purposely fail any ""test"" that a woman gives them, just for the sake of proving to her that he resents being manipulated. How many women will really want to keep a man that they feel they have outsmarted?"
4,It is a plan,"I liked this book, because instead of giving you vague, abstract advice like 'Just be yourself' or 'Act approachable' the authors give you an actual plan that you can follow to the letter or when you feel more comfortable with men, use sparingly. The only thing that concerned me was the 'testing' part of the book. It seems to me someone bright would be able to see what you are doing and be offended."
1,How To Succeed With Men,"This is just a reworking of the authors earlier book ""How To Succeed With Women"", leaving out the sections on how to seduce a woman. While there is a little bit of good, common sense advice, I found that most of the book was to try and make women into little ""Stepford"" girlfriends. The authors seem more interested in having a man's needs met, rather than helping women get a relationship that's fulfilling for them."
3,"Too much ""How to"" for my taste","This book has some great insights into relating to men, but it's too much of ""do this, and don't do that"". I didn't really need an instruction book."
3,Great gloves - Sizing is goofy,"I'm conflicted about how to rate these gloves.. I really like them - they're my third pair (maybe they could be more durable ;) ) HOWEVER - Sometime between my second and third (and fourth - I'll explain) pair, Alipinestars apparently lost their mind with regard to sizing. The whole story is a bit long and tedious, but the short version is, I bought a pair (my third) of XXL, same as my second pair, but they were too tight for comfort. I bought a fourth pair, also XXL, thinking the third pair had been mis-marked or mis-packaged, and they were ALSO too tight. I think Alipinestars has changed their concept of XXL, and it no longer fits my hands. I could try XXXL, but I'm getting a bit tired of playing size games."
4,A solid western,This western was better than I expected. The story was good and the principal actors did a good job. It is a rather grim story and makes good points about revenge and forgiveness. Ruth Roman has a good role which is really an integral part of the story. It is one of those small scale westerns of 50's which sometimes were really good. Even Kermit Maynard is included among the actors!
5,Just what I was looking for!,"I had never read anything by this author, but I was anxious to study about how Christianity got to where we are today. I just finished another book ""The Domestication Of Transendence:How Modern Thinking About God Went Wrong"" by William Placher who dealt with late medival and 17th century writings. So I needed to start further back to have a good foundation for knowledge of Christian thought.What I discovered in Wilken's book was a well-ordered, easy-to-read narration of much more than a historical account. He explores what is behind the ideas and the doctrines of the time period from the ressurection to the 7th century.This book was very enlightening and I look forward to further readings on this subject."
5,In depth beautifully written dicussion of the underpinnings of Christian thinking and theology,"We chose it for our scripture study group. it was magnificent. The language is advanced-college level --we kept a dictionary handy. The themes, the writing, the interesting and inspiring discussion of the development of early christian thinking and theology were often new to us ""old"" Catholics and awe inspiring..Recommend for people especially Catholics who are interested in the development ofChristian thought doctrine and theology. It doesn't have a study guide so we read and talked about especially menaingful passages."
5,Academically Devotional,"Dr. Wilken's book is both historically informative and spiritually challenging. As one who has a B.A. in Theology, I have say that this book really stands out from all the historical theology texts I read during my undergraduate studies. I highly recommend it."
5,Download: Charlie's Family,"Download's ""Charlie's Family"" starts off with flowing distorted synths and then merge into a 60s-ish hippy chants and then transforms into what it sounds like a female orgasm.(It sounds real. Then later in the album there are samples of Mr. Manson himself doing raves and rants with a great fashion, then it flows into a tabeau of synths and effects. Track 3 ""TRICK OR TREAT"" has a killer synth beat and a melody, then to a sinister drug-crazed atmosphere sample. Track 6 opens with a cat being tortured over some sonic psychotic theme.""Charlie's Family"" is very disturbing and if you listen to it enough you probably kill your family. RELEASED ON METROPOLIS RECORDS IN 1997DOWNLOAD IS: DWAYNE GOETTEL(R.I.P), cEvin Key and PHIL WESTERN"
4,simpler times of charles manson and jim jones,"This is my first Download cd. Some of it is Beautiful; some, just FillHer. ""Trick or Treat"" and ""Yes"" are scary songs. My favorite is ""Thank You,"" which sounds like curtains of noise, blowing through the smashed windows of some deserted house.This is good music to listen to while vacuuming or fixing a broken toilet"
2,Eh.,"Although there are some fine moments of weird noise and occasionally some nice beats and ideas, this album was a bit too wandering and abstract for my tastes. It's a soundtrack, and in that vein it becomes sort of backgroundish after awhile. I'd only recommend it to ascertained Download fans."
3,Well...,"If you LOVED ""Inception"", one of subcon studios' ""from the vault"" collections, pick this up for more of the same.These are soundscapes more than songs, all nicely blended with creepiness and chaos, but nothing that warrents spending top dollar for its relative rarity."
1,be careful...,"my husband took this product as directed for two days, then began having visual disturbances..by the time i got him to the hospital, he was close to passing out...i would not take this unless i got a doctor's ok, and even then, the er doc had no idea what the side effects of the ingredients were...i wrote herbalife, but received no reply..."
1,Illegal to sell Herbalife on here!!!!,It is a BREACH of Herbalife corporate rules to pawn off products on Amazon or E Bay.The products are great but must be purchased directly from someone you KNOW who is a current Herbalife Distributor in good standing. Buyer beware!
1,??,"This product, taken as directed, makes little sense. You can get a prescription and purchase more reliable FDA approved drugs for about the same price, or less."
4,Better than it sounds,"Better than the generic titled 'Acoustic' series sounds, there's a lot here that's a bit different, a bit distinctive, from Beth Orton to Dylan covers, don't quite know what Oasis are doing here, but this is better than mood music. You can listen to it!"
2,Not a cleanser....,I'm a huge fan of Laura mercier but This product does truely suck.not enough forming point where your face doesn't get clean at all!!!Shame..please don't purchase this cleaner ladys or guys.
4,Hard to Get DVD,"I was very happy to find a copy of this movie, and even happier when it arrived. The dvd case and disk were in perfect condition, and the digital quality and rendering was very good. The film could have been very similar to so many of the era; of a rich, spoiled girl who thinks she can do whatever she likes, and a hard working young man who sees life from the other side, but instead, the quality of the acting made the movie so much more entertaining. Olivia De Havilland and Dick Powell, both of whom I have always liked, along with the rest of the supporting cast, helped to make it an enjoyable comedy which was well worth watching."
5,My ideal keyboard,"This keyboard is THE best I've ever used. After almost four years of using this keyboard, I'm purchasing a second one (as a back up) even though my current one is still functioning. The print on a few keys is worn off but that's a minor thing for over fours years of steady use.The size is perfect. The action of the keys is great. Everything works as it should. I've become a real 'fuss budget' when it comes to the placement of the 'delete' key. Can't stand keyboards that hide the key that most of us use so often. I do a lot of editing and find that things like well thought out key placement are really important.For anyone who does writing and editing, this is a great keyboard."
1,Not durable enough,"I'm not particularly hard on keyboards and bought this one only to use at work. All the same, this keyboard didn't last more than 6 months before the space bar key ceased working entirely. Not recommended."
5,Works great,One of the wireless keyboard i had. I'm able to control my laptop from 11ft away with no problem. I have my laptop connected to my TV
4,"So far, so good.","I had no problems installing the keyboard(hooked it up with an Adesso PS/2 to USB adapter). I got the drivers off their website and installation was quick and easy. I was using the keyboard in minutes.So far I've been using it constantly and haven't had any major problems with it, but I don't really use the multimedia functions. The multimedia buttons in particular feel kind of cheaply made, and the rest of the keyboard kind of does too, but I haven't had any problems with anything breaking so far. The extra space on my desk is absolutely great, though it took me a couple of days to get used to the size of the keys. Definitely a good buy if you're looking to conserve deskspace and don't need a full keyboard."
1,Junk!,"Space bar was stuck within the first 5 minutes of use. Never did unstick so I sent it back. Great return process, just a poor keyboard."
1,Poor manufacturing,I was very disappointed with the keyboard. I like the size but the quality of keys and response is very bad. I got a defective piece where the keys were just getting stuck. I am currently using a Microsoft keyboard but needed a smaller footprint to match the size of laptop keyboard.
5,Adesso Mini Keyboard,Compact and still available in PS2 format. Happy that it wasn't UBS. Excellent for multi-boot computer.
3,Couldn't get used to higher resistance of keys,"I bought this keyboard for the same reason as others - to make more room to the right so I don't have to reach as far for the mouse. This keyboard works fine, but it takes more effort to press the keys. I gave myself a month to get used to this, but I never did. I consistently have more typos than I did previously. I finally went back to my old keyboard and I'm ""reaching"" again. Here's a TIP: to find more keyboard alternatives, search on ""left-handed keyboard"". These have the key pad on the left. I wish I had thought of this earlier, because I could have found another keyboard that was almost identical to my old favorite keyboard. Sigh."
3,"Worked great, until it broke..","Great keyboard if space saving is a must. Ordered Mine in October, and the right arrow key now sporadically stops working. It's still under warranty so I will be able to RMA it, but the customer is responsible for shipping cost. Other than that, no complaints. (But that is pretty pitiful that a keyboard button only lasts a few months.)"
3,Good but ....,I would have given it a 5 star if the keyboard can lay downflat as mentioned by another reviewer here before.
1,Awful,Had this keyboard connected to my computer for only 15 minutes. Keys did not register when pressed or had to be pressed several times very hard. I may have just got a lemon but I am not buying another Adesso keyboard.
2,Short cord,"I have been using AKB-110B which aside from a harder touch is performing well. I was pleased to find the MCK-91 preferring the key size of the Shift, Backspace, Tab and a few other keys which are closer to that of the traditional key board. But for some reason the company shortened the cord. So much so that I am unable to reconfigure my office to use the keyboard...now on its way back."
5,Geopathic stress,"A wonderfull book on Geo energies,i ever seen in last 8 years. a good relation between geopathy & electromagnatic is explained. how these stress can affect human body retham. good detail to nutralise these stresses."
4,i think that the title fits the story perfactly,this is probaly one of the best books iv ever read. it had a great plot and the characters were great.
2,Dead Man in Indian Creek,"This murder mystery book of only 130 pages, would seem to be a sound choice for 3rd to 5th graders,but it does have an adult nature to it. The two boys in the story are 12 years old, one is being raised in a single parent family (mother). She is involved with a man, the boys believe to be involved in the murder. She leaves him alone, repeatedly. There also is reference to teenage drug and alcohol parties at the quarry where the boys have a fort built. The murder is connected to cocaine drug dealing of which the mother is involved in. While these are themes we see every day on TV and in movies, probably best read with a parent or as a pre-adult."
5,"Great, except...","Excellent novel, except for the fact that these bad guys seem to commit child abuse, and they seem to be raping a woman (Parker's mom). Remember, they tie up Parker's mom as well as Matt and Parker. They're psychos, man. If this is put into a movie, this ought to be rated PG-13 (unless it has already been put into a movie, and it has another rating)."
3,A twisting mystery,be prepared for a turning mystery of a murderer a drug dealer and so many more twists and turns you won't be able to put it down
4,Worth it if you're a Titaniac,"The game is ok, but the real gem is the ability to walk around the Titanic. If you're really into the Titanic, then this tour is really worth the price of admission."
2,I love this game...but,This is the best game in the world to use with middle school kids to teach reasoning skills. UNFORTUNATELY it only runs on windows 97 or such and it won't work for me. If you can use it...Get it! It is fun.
2,Titanic adventure out of time,"this program cds are backward, you have to use disc 2 first and itsfor windows 95 i could not play all of it i have xp and it would crashi would like to be able to play it all. can you fix it so it will playon xp windows"
1,That was awful! Terrible! (I sat through the entire movie.),"Gormenghast is one of the worst movies I've seen, excluding martial arts action films. Most of the characters were utterly without depth or interest, being overdramatic quota-filling morons. The cast consistently overacted. They were ridiculous, but not enough to be funny. The beginning was hard to follow because there wasn't proper explanation between scenes for those who haven't read the books. Some parts might have seemed profound in the book but were unnecessary extras in the movie, like the girl Titus decided he loved.Fuschia was a neurotic bimbo, and extremely annoying. Her drowning was instant. For the sake of accuracy, it should have been much longer and more excruciating.The only good character was Steerpike, who was evil and by the end very hard to sympathize with. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is simply beautiful, though, and it's very hard to dislike him in the role. Watching his face was the only reason I stayed to the end of the movie."
1,Gormenghast DVD,I was disappointed with the story content. It was almost silly and the character played by Jonathan Rys Meyers was too comical to be sinister. It came across as more of an adult fairy tale.
1,A poor rendition,"I really enjoy the Gormenghast novels, and BBC movies, but this film was really poor. I won't go into great detail here... but I will suggest that if you watch Gormenghast at all, wait until it comes on TV. If you are going to waste your four hours, at least don't waste your money."
1,GORMENGHAST,"THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE OF ITS KIND I'VE EVER SEEN. SLOW , SILLY UNINTERESTING AND JUST PLAIN LOUSY. SO SORRY I PURCHASED IT. DON'T ALWAYS GO BY WHAT AMAZON RECOMMENDS."
5,Bloody Fabulous!,"This has to be one of the best fantasy movies without magic that there has ever been. I adored Jonathan Rhys Meyers' portrayal of Steerpike, and he seemed to be made for the part. Not to mention he's bloody gorgeous. But, as for Titus, Andrew Robertson plays the part well. He seems to understand the pressures of a ritualized life as if he has lived it himself. All the actors and actresses do every part they play a justice that is rare in a movie based on a literary masterpiece. The scenary and sets make you believe that you are actually in a place called Gormenghast, that it is more real and alive than just a fictional place in a book. If you have read the Gormenghast trilogy, or just fell in love with the idea of it, watch this movie! It is the ultimate escape from reality with a handsome, powerhungry kitchenboy, a romantic, lonely dreamer, and a strong, spirited heir."
1,"If you've read & loved the novels, pass this by...","I was REALLY looking forward to this mini-series. Then, I actually saw it. Perhaps it was better in the wide-screen version, as suggested by another reviewer, but surely it couldn't be any WORSE an adaptation!Where is the Hall of Bright Carvings? Why does a 14 yr.old look 28? Why are scenes there that do not exist in Peake's writings?? (Steerpike ""dropping in"" on Titus' naming ceremony, for instance.)Christopher Lee was the best thing about it.If you HAVEN'T read the novels and enjoy fantasy, you will probably enjoy this video/DVD. If you know the works, steer clear of this one. :("
4,Crteating a movie,"I liked the movie a lot. I could not imagine a better visual representation of this fantastic novel. I enjoyed the places and characters they created based on the book.Not to long, not to short. The scenes contained enough dialogs to understand the meaning of them, very close to the book."
4,GORMENGHAST A DISAPPOINTMENT (I GIVE IT 3.5 STARS),"AFTER HAVING READ THE THREE MERVYN PEAKE NOVELS ON WHICH THIS FILM IS BASED, WITH ALL PEAKE'S COLORFUL (UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE YEAR), BIZARRE EVENTS AND SURREALISTIC SETTINGS, I WAS EXPECTING THIS DVD TO BE SUPERB.UNFORTUNATELY IT WASN'T, IN MY OPINION AND THAT OF MY FRIENDS (ALSO FANS OF PEAKE & GORMENGHAST). THE CASTING WAS TERRIBLE (EXCEPT MAYBE IN THE CASES OF THE TWINS AND SPEARPIKE). THE BRITISH MOVIE-MAKERS SKIPPED SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SCENES IN THE TRILOGY OF BOOKS, AND I FOUND MYSELF BORED AFTER THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF THREE MINI-SERIES-LIKE EPISODES ON THE DVD.I WISH SO DEEPLY THAT I COULD SAY MORE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL MASTERPIECE, BUT I MUST BE HONEST. I SOLD MY COPY OF THE DVD AFTER ONLY ONE VIEWING. :("
5,WoW! Really good movie,"Ok, I saw this movie with a friend and I really like it. The characters are a lovely arrange from a stupid princess to the geinus of a man, STEERPIKE! Wow, i dont know, i will write more later."
2,"Nice art direction, I'll give it that...","Anything Ian Richardson does is worth full attention, but the acting by the younger leads is embarrassing & the lines sound like weak warmed-over watered-down Lewis Carroll. What is it about the British appetite for this silly mindless nonsense? Something in the air I guess...or maybe it's the water. Too kewt by a couple of light-years."
3,Missed opportunity,"Somehow, only in the last two hours did they finally begin to reach some of the texture of the books. Because the books are mostly that: texture. Hugely descriptive, they extend moments into centuries, and the plot is just a barely visible quiver near the enormous weight of the stones. It was only rarely that they reached that in this production -- so don't expect it. I think, somehow, with more sensitivity it could have been a really astounding thing -- the definitive Gormenghast is still waiting to be filmed."
3,Gormenghastly...,"A fairly decent feature. The gothic overtones and OTT acting make this a memorable piece. Rhys-Myers oozes charisma as the brilliant but nasty Steerpike. Some class actors and fine imagery, Gormenghast is a well made adaptation if some what sombre in parts."
1,Very poor,"No film of a book will ever, ever match up to what images have been conjured in ones imagination, with this in mind I was prepared for the let down. However, no matter how much I have tried I cannot get myself to like it. Prunesquallor for one seems more serious than in the novel, his annoying laughs are missed. Another thing, the dialogue seems so cheesy on film, it is unwatchable at times. To be fair this isnt the worst adaption of a great work of literature, some performances (Steerpike's for one) are not bad. I just think that this could have been great, if only Terry Gilliam had got to it first. A dark trilogy turned into a light comic drama, if you like that sort of thing and havent read the books then you might like it, if you have read them then try not to allow your memory to be tainted."
1,Please read the books instead.,"For the [price] you pay for the DVD you could buy (at least) the first two, and most satisfying, books of the trilogy in hardback and own one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. As small screen entertainment, Ghormenghast fails to capture any of the scale and drama of the Peake masterpiece and you'll watch it once (if that) and wish you hadn't.This really is dross..."
2,Aesop fanatic weeps,"This dangerously obsessed aesop rock reviewer is thouroughly dissapointed. (The fact that I've done everything save tatoo his name on my @ss should prove my credibility.) Contrary to the above reviewers confused review, Mr. Higgins hits the nail on the head in saying the lyrics are incomprehensible. He doesn't mean complex, duh, he means you can't hear a word he says. That's the biggest dissapointment. To hear babble in the place of rich, dense lyrics of the poetic genius is a tragedy. Yes, Def Jux gets an A in the innovative department, but the noisy, lagging beats impede the momentum of Aesop's rugged,intense voice, which blockhead's beats so perfectly complimented. It's as if a futuresque instrumental was overlapped by hastened, spouted lyrics; the results being a mismatch. Notwithstanding, nothing can dillute my obsession with Aesop, not even this album."
5,Dental Cannons... Molar Pistols,"straight from the ""Rotten Apple""... Bazooka Tooth is way better than Labor Days... I always thought Labor Days was Aesop Rocks' weakest effort though... I also think Float, Appleseed are better albums than Labor Days (Music for Earthworms is pretty good too)... Bazooka Tooth is a way DIFFERENT, which is good, ... with production mostly from Aesop himself, it is interesting tenfold... this is where Hip-Hop should be... Who ever said Hip-Hop is dead is stupid... I guess good music scares most people.Standout tracks: all of them, these are just really good.03. Easy06. Super Fluke07. Cook It Up (feat. P.F.A.C.)08.

1,F**K AESOP ROCK,"aesop rocks lyrics, are complete and utter babble. Trash at its finest. GARBAGE!if someone ever comes up to me and tries to tell me that aesop and el-p are the future of anything i'm going to slap them...someone, anyone, give me one good reason why incoherent, nonsensical, scatterbrain lyrics are so damn good..I will give it to anyone that his beats are usually top shelf, his voice is nice.....he needs to do about 55 more songs like ""No Regrets"" before he gets my vote..his albums are trach minus the beats...Peace"
4,where did blockhead go?,"i'd say aes has been spending way too much time with el-p. over the course of one album his beats have gone from jazzy, organic sounding into some synthy futuristic beats that wouldn't sound out of place in an episode of star trek. not that experimentation is bad..its just that nobody makes El-p beats like el-p and he sounds much better over blockheads production. lyrics are same old thing, brilliance. vocals seem a little sloppy, though, a lot of it sounds like hes falling asleep. but only someone like aesop rock could put out one of the best releases of the year and have it be his worst record."
4,A bad aesop album is better 99.9% of everything out there.,"Not that this is a bad Aesop album. El-P's Fantastic Damage completely blew me away and this Aesop album seems to borrow from its sound. That took away from it a little for me. I have to say, Aesop is our generation's Bob Dylan. He's a poetic genius who can lace both deep and mundane ideas into the same rhymes and deal with universal human experiences in completely new ways. A warning: if you are not intelligent, and if you are not openminded, you will not be able to handle Aes Rock. On the other hand, if you want to see what the form of music called Hip Hop is capable of at its very best, check out Aesop Rock and El P."
3,"BLOCKHEADE,WHERE ARE YOU WHEN WE NEED YOU?","AESOP'S LYRICS ARE MASTERFUL AS ALWAYS,BUT EL-P NEEDS TO HAND OVER THE BEAT MACHINE TO BLOCKHEAD,THIS FUTURISTIC CRAP MAY WORK FOR THE REST OF THE DEF JUX FAMILY,BUT AESOP NEEDS TO STICK WITH THE DEEP SOUL BEATS THAT BLOCKHEAD PROVIDED ON LABOR DAYS...EL-P ,GO AWAY"
2,Lost Aesop verse discovered under pyramids,"Absurd long-words perform surgical intrusions,Impeding the brain with cranial confusions,Convoluted metaphors create pompous delusions,Leaving cyberpseuds with paranoid illusions"
5,Easily his best album.,"Production on this album is the best I've heard from Aesop Rock.I'm not getting in depth, but the storytelling joints are well done, and Aesop comes extremely close to having songs worthy of mainstream radio, such as 11:35, Easy, and Lime Lighters. These tracks are half-bangers, as they are torn up much too well for the radio to embrace them.Great album, too bad Labor Days wasn't produced somewhat like this, maybe Aesop's terribly annoying lyrics would sound better."
5,The definition of aggrotech,"Bunkertor 7 (Bunker Gate Seven) is the kind of album that defines an artist, what every single thing he does after is compared to. And for good reason - the sounds presented here are the essential combination of angst and raw energy necessary for such a product, a perfectly contained opus of destruction that is often copied, and never quite emulated. The catharsis of early Wumpscut, and especially releases such as Bunkertor 7, does quite well in lieu of expensive psychotherapy! But be forewarned: any artist who travels the often mediocre ocean of aggrotech will always be just an imitation of the great Rudy R. in his heyday."
5,Rudy is amazing!,"I do sound editing and i'm just amazed at how awsome he is, combining so many sounds and layers and making them gell like that is just increadable. To have that creative talent and make it sound so DAMN good! EXTREMELY talented, one of the best darkwave or dark industrial i have ever heard! In otherwords he kicks EVERYONES ...! Extremely creative and brilliant, wish i was that good. Rudy is a great example to follow for his brillant dark industrial/techno industrial in his musical creations."
4,"Dark,Spooky,Harsh but good Industrial",this album hits you like a Razer blade slashing at you while burning from Napalm. Wumpscut Delivers Hard hitting beats and spooky Calm beats and makes you not know whats next. The vocals go from Trent Reznor's low hissing in Such Songs to Loud Vocals with might be heard from Ministry. i had to stop then play this album just to keep my breathe.
2,It's probably Wumpscut's best CD...,"but that's still not enough for me to put it on these days. I had withdrawn from the entire industrial scene for several months (strictly listening to IDM, progressive hip-hop, and indie rock during that timespan) -- and now that I listen to it with fresh ears... hrm. It's a tad too cheesy for my tastes nowadays. However, even after fresh ears I still enjoy the likes of Skinny Puppy and Dive tremendously. I suppose Dive's influence on Rudy was the where initial attraction lied. But otherwise, it's really nothing new and falls into the realm of industrial mediocrity. Anyone who would rather listen to something other than this second-rate act should certainly pick up Dive's _Snakedressed_ or if they can find it, _No Pain No Game_."
2,"A great book, poor binding",I was wondering if anyone else experienced any problems with the extremely weak binding of this paperback edition? I received a brand new copy and am already dealing with pages coming loose from the stingy adhesive binding. A disappointment. I will now be searching for a sturdier hardback edition!
2,"Not exactly what i ordered, but was called at least.","I purchased this item under thinking it would come with the travel case. I was contacted by the seller a week or so after i placed my order asking if it was alright if he sent it without the case. I said yes, but I'm getting tired of the old switch-a-roo some of these sellers do with their items. Never seem to get what I wanted in the first place. Settled with it being sent w/out the bag because I just need to get these in my truck before the cold weather hit. Just a heads up."
4,Good Product,"The quality of the cables are a good value for the money, however it would have been nice if they threw in a free carying bag/case."
4,This item seems fine for the price.,But only time will tell how part will hold up. the fit and finish was good. I only wish it had a grease fitting. But aside from that it was good.
4,Good looking and functional,"I have been looking for a bench with space to keep shoes out of the way. I have a small apartment, and therefore, a small entry way. All the other benches I found had 3 cubbies and were too long, so when I saw this one with 2 cubbies I was thrilled. It arrived in good time and was easy to put together - although having two people makes it go faster and easier.I set it right inside my door and bought canvas baskets (Household Essentials Storage Bin with Handles, Natural Canvas on Amazon) to go inside the cubbies. The baskets fit perfectly and make keeping shoes and dog leashes out of sight and out of the way. It is perfect - and sturdy - my 250 pound friend came in and sat on it to take off his shoes and it didn't feel flimsy to him at all.Pros: Fast shipping, easy to put together (with help), good size for small spaces, keeps shoes organized, sturdyCons: For my use - there are none :)"
4,Fresh Beat Band/ Yo Gabba Gabba,My daughter loves to watch the fresh beat band and listen to there songs. But this last episode combined two of her most favorite shows Yo Gabba Gabba and Fresh beat band that made it a wonderful and entertaining episode that I just had to get. Of course it was a little cheesy but what kid show isn't. I loved how this episode combined songs from both shows truly original in every way! :)
3,Ceaper By The Dozen,"Was bought for my daughter, have watched it with her and its okay. A good family story of all wanting different things but realising they have more than they need already."
2,At least it's better yhen the Frogger 1-Game stick,"Most likely a port of Konami Arcade Advanced for the Gameboy Advance. It has the same pathetic excuse for Frogger that's on the Frogger stick, but at least you get 5 more games with this one."
1,This is a scam,"This is old NES versions, not the arcade versions we are lead to believe. Still with Jakks."
1,Borders on false advertising,"With the excellent arcade reconstructions coming from Radica and Jakks Games, I was pleased to see Majesco jumping on the bandwagon, and promptly picked this one up. I am thoroughly disappointed. As someone else has said, these are probably NES ports. They are definitely NOT the arcade originals. Nowhere on the box does it say this. Maybe if you're a real game shark you could tell from the pictures on the box. I think that's a lot to ask of the typical consumer.Note that Majesco has also put out a sister product that contains Frogger, and nothing else (why?). Maybe if you buy it, you will get the real arcade version. I won't know, because I refuse to buy another Majesco product. Gamers everywhere, I urge you to write Majesco and let them know that this is NOT acceptable. We deserve better."
4,fun game,"Like other TV joystick games, I consider this to be a fun game if you keep in mind what you are getting. For the price, I think it's well worth it to play time pilot and the other games.Sure, they aren't exactly the same as the arcade games, but they are still fun. They've provided my kids with many hours of entertainment.As with all games, eventually the wires leading from the joystick to the TV break inside, and then you lose either sound or video. If you are pretty handy, it's an easy but annoying task to replace the wires. however, it probably takes about 40-70 hours of gameplay for that to happen, so I will only ding it one star for that."
2,Disapponted 80's kid,"Please read other reviews of this arcade game in addition to mine for a better overall view of it. My review will only cover the ""Time Pilot"" game included. It was awful. Almost EVERYTHING was different from the classic 80's arcade version...the beginning, the action, the sound, the music, the graphics, gameplay...did I already say almost EVERYTHING?! I can only assume the other games are very different from their originals, too. HUGE disappointment; so much so that I'm GIVING it away...if I sell it, some guy in his 30's will demand his $5.00 back. You've been warned."
4,Not bad at all,"Some great tunes on here, I personally like Transformation the most. Also, if you make music and need some samples, the second disc is really nice to have. Listening to it would bore you, though..."
2,Not impressed,"This album features several supposed remixes (or 'unmixes') from Solutions for a Small Planet. This album is Solutions, with all energy mixed out. Some people may appreciate the ambience... but there's already enough industrial turned spacey. Listen to this album while settling down to bed. But if there's someone else in bed with you, put Solutions on."
5,WOW,"There's really not much to say, because words cannot describe anything done by the Cirque. You must buy this cd."
3,Needs Updating,I loved the music of the Las Vegas show and purchased the CD. I was disappointed however as the CD is from 1998 and needs updating. The current cast in Las Vegas showcases at least two lady's who in my opinion have tremendous voices and much better than those on the CD. I would like to see them make a recording of the current show and update the CD. Also the male vocal in the current show is better. The selection Mer Noire in the show is much longer than the 5 minutes and change as is on the current CD and is much more enjoyable.
2,doesn't have all the music,"I bought this disc specifically for a track I heard when I saw the show, but it's not there. I was extremely disappointed. All the other tracks are good but not as reminiscent for me."
5,"You MUST see the show!! If you can't, buy the CD!",I was lucky enough to get second row tickets on my recent trip to Vegas. I expected an OK show. It was one of the most awe inspiring things I have experienced in my entire life. It was something to remember for a lifetime. Get good seats (there aren't really any bad seats). The music is so fluid that you are lost in the stage. You just want to run off with the characters! GO SEE THIS! I'm thinking about going back just to see this great performance again.
2,Disappointing,"True, there were some good memories from the show, but overall this CD didn't stack up to other greats (like Quidam).Since O is such a visually-based show, I needed to be there again. Plus, I think my favourite 30 minutes of music from the 90 minute show didn't make the 60 minute CD. There was one song from the barge sketch in particular that just knocked my socks off, and I was hoping to find it on the CD, but didn't. Hence my disappointment."
5,One of the best Cirque du Soleil Soundtracks,"The music to the great hit show ""O"" by Cirque du Soleil is IMO also one of the best OST of all Cirque shows overall, maybe only topped by the soundtrack for the CDS show ""Varekai"", although the soundtrack for ""Mystere"" and ""KÀ"" are not very much ""behind"" either. :)The music is for the most part electronic (synthesizers) and makes extensive use of soprano singing by an experienced female singer. It's great music to relax to and if you also like music by artists like Enya, Jean Michel Jarre or Vangelis, you will almost certainly like this one too."
5,"great music, great show","I just saw both ""O"" and Mystere the second week of January 2001. By far, I felt O was much better than Mystere. The set of ""O"" is the most unusual, elegant,and beautiful set I have ever seen. The performers in both shows are incredible athletes, and the music in both was similar, but I was really drawn to the music of ""O""--it has a lighter,haunting quality to it. Great for listenng to on a rainy day, or as background to a dinner party."
5,Cirque outdoes itself again!,"As usual, Cirque du Soleil creates music that completely defies description. This CD, recorded at the Bellagio resort in Las Vegas (home to the production of O), combines many music genres, often juxtaposing contrasting types for added flavor.The CD itself takes listeners on a journey of life, love, death, and rebirth; one moment it is triumphant, the next playful, suddenly turning dark and mysterious. It's a spectacular CD, full of surprises and beauty.Recommended Tracks:Tzelma (track 3), Simcha (8), Ephra (10), O (13)"
2,I'll never buy a CD based on reviews again.,There is some interesting music on this CD but it absolutelypails in comparison to other CdS albums such as Alegria orSaltimbanco. It just sounds way too manufactured and dull andlacks the originality of other CdS collections.It's not a bad CD but the problem is that others in theseries set such a high watermarks.
4,A good CD But Mystere Live is much better.,"I enjoy the CD more than I enjoyed the show. It has a couple of good tracks on it but some corny ones. But the tracks I like are very smooth and relaxing. But as I said Mystere Live is five times better and the Mystere show is ten times better. The best tracks on ""O"" are 3,6,9,10, and the best is 11."
4,Second favorite CdS CD - after Alegria,"Cirque du Soleil always comes up with incredibly dramatic music and ""O"" is no exception. Makes me want to see the show in Las Vegas."
3,1100 mAh instead of the advertised 1200,"Amazon describes the batteries as ""3.7 V / 1200 mAh "". However, the printing on the battery reads ""3.7 V 1100 mAh."" I don't have a way to tell the actual capacity, and they are probably a better value than the OEM Canon battery, even at the reduced capacity. Nevertheless, it would be nice if the Amazon description were accurate."
4,Great price,Arrived partially charged. Worked right out of the box. Can't beat the price. Cannot say anything about longevity at this point.
2,"Blah . . . little to recommend this book, especially considering the price","Content is light on history and heavy on testimony. The author is giving a talk in church rather than a good window into the Smith family. Mostly gleaned from Lucy Mack's history with little from other sources. I almost suspect the author had a Lucy's book in a word file and just copied and pasted. A much better source for this info is the annotated Lucy's Book. The best treatments for the more obscure family members (Samuel, William, Don Carlos, Sophronia, Katherine, Lucy the younger) still remain article length treatments from peer-reviewed journals. United by Faith, though not definative by any means, far outstrips this particular volume. McGavin's Family of Joseph Smith is likewise more useful."
4,GREAT sunglasses. My first of many pairs.,"I've always worn Oakley, but decided to try these....WOW....I LOVE them. Really high quality and decent price. You've switched me."
5,Best sunglasses ever!,I am 54 and I have had a pair of these for over 3 years now and love them! They weigh nothing and are polarized!
4,Party hearty! Cute and funny lights,"I bought these as a gift, and yes I did give them away, although I was sorely tempted to keep them. These are cute and funny. I think they look perfect for an outdoor party/BBQ or a fun indoor cocktail party. I wish they made them to look like margaritas, then I would buy a few for myself :)The ones I bought were all different colors and not just red, although I think I like the red ones. I would use them for a Christmas party."
1,Adesso 2150 Keyboard Poor Quility,"I was very disapointed with the 2150 Adesso keyboard. It's made of a very thin plastic that pops and snaps when you rest your hands on it. There are very few screws which alows the base plate to move and seem about to fall open. This movement of the case can cause letters to be typed inadvertantly. The controls for the touch pad are difficult to use. Finally, my Apple optical mouse would not work when conected to the usb port on the keyboard. I'm sending mine back.I have used Adesso keyboards in the past with no problems but this one is a looser -- too bad.Tim"
3,"wish it was better built, trackpad not well set up","after about two years of heavy use, i'm surprised at this flimsy-feeling keyboard's durability.. still, it now and then causes a doubled key, it creaks, the escape key fell off & stays on better upside down and the trackpad has a few problems -- it should be positioned closer to the space bar, and the ""mouse"" buttons are in an awkward location (so i just use a real mouse)in comparison, i have also had a Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite, which had a better feel, but lacked a true Mac layout, and the arrow keys were clumsy.. my old Apple adjustable keyboard (with separate keypad, long out of production) had the best action and flexibility; when funds allow, i plan to replace the Adesso with a Kinesis or similar adjustable keyboard"
5,Just a great book overall,i got this book actually about 8 or so years ago and have enjoyed reading it over and over again.. i love this book. a great edition to anyones collection
5,Lush Life - Excellent,"LUSH LIFE is a collection of 12 classic ""pop"" songs performed by Linda Ronstadt with Nelson Riddle and His Orchestra.LUSH LIFE is one out of the three Ronstadt forays into the world of jazz standards and WWII-era pop numbers. Like its companions WHAT'S NEW and FOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS, it captures the multi-faceted soprano buoyed by Nelson Riddle's big band stylings. Riddle, the former Frank Sinatra arranger, employs such luminaries as Louie Bellson, Peter Asher and Don Grolnick to aid Ronstadt along the journey. Ronstadt's interpretations range from the delightful and playful to sassy and romantic. At times the orchestration can get a little too sweet, but Ronstadt sings such faves as ""When I Fall In Love,"" ""Skylark,"" ""Sophisticated Lady,"" ""Falling In Love Again,"" ""Lush Life"" and ""You Took Advantage Of Me"" with enough charm and grace to overshadow some of Riddle's overly ambitious arrangements."
5,The finest lyrics combined with outstanding vocal work,"While Linda Rondstadt's material has not appealed to myself, her voice was always admirable. She transcends all boundaries with her skills on this and two other related albums. Each song is a time capsule representing the greatest loves and losses of the World War II era. The human need to express emotion has been the highest motivater for songwriters. People separated by world crisis and the lonliness that follows is captured in these Nelson Riddle arrangements. This is the sort of music that binds all ages and backgrounds."
5,What an album!,"I was not a big fan of big band music or Linda Ronstadt. To be honest, I don't know why I bought this cassette in 1984 when I was in college, but it became one of my favorite albums ever. I believe she was on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and sang Skylark (I think) on the show. I was bowled over. Great songs, great vocals from Ronstadt, excellent arrangements, ... just a near perfect album. From a hard rock n roll fan, this was a major leap for me, but I could listen to this album all day long!"
4,I Have The Cassette Tape!,I like Linda Ronstadt and I have this Lush Life album but I have the cassette tape and not the CD. Someone I know was getting rid of her old cassette tapes and she gave several to me and this was one of them and I think it's good!
5,"After Reading Vol. I, Who Could Not Read Vol. II","Those interested in confessional Lutheran orthodoxy / theology and church history will be thankful for these excellent translations from the German by Matthew Harrison. The two volumes of ""The Lonely Way"" constitute the expression of one of the finer theological minds of the past 100 years, the late Hermann Sasse. We must thank his son for permitting the translations and publication by Concordia Publishing House(CPH)of St. Louis. I have made much use of these volumes recently as reference and quotation not to mention to tell others to place these volumes on the top of their reading list if they have them, or that they should obtain them."
2,Pretty bad,"I heard this at an acquaintance's house with my best friend. Our host really liked this cd, but my friend and I could only wince through most of it. We almost begged to be forgived of our sins at their raping of Depeche Mode's ""stripped""...it wasn't even funny in a Laibach kind of way, just very painful. If you like Tyranny era Front 242, you might like this as it's almost a direct clone...I'm not much of a 242 fan myself. While lately ISC seem to be getting better, I can't recommend this mostly monotonous cd to anyone. There's been worse, but not many..."
5,Violins and 'celli. Who needs 'em??,"A delightful exercise in orchestration, this recording features 48 violas from the major London orchestras in numbers ranging from Gershwhin to Bacharach to Faure. With the exception of some percussion here and there, a harp and the occasional string bass, these selections are NOTHING but violas."
4,"Christianity, Poetry, and Art","A wonderful but uneven collection of Auden's prosaic yet poetic musings on art, philosophy, and religion. The first couple sections are the best - a collection of Auden's snarky aphorisms about poetry, art, and reading (""Readers are like the young boys who scribble mustaches on the faces of girls in magazine advertisements""). The essay ""The Virgin and the Dynamo"" is an understated but forceful attack on philosophical materialism and determinsim, while ""The Poet and the City"" examines the relation of the individual versus the faceless mob. The ""Postscript on Christianity and Art"" is also quite good. The rest are more specific essays on various poets and playwrights - read them for your lit crit class but not on your own."
4,An enjoyable read,"Casual in a sense, not twist your brain all up in the ugly way that a lot of ""theorists"" seem to like to. It's straight talk about poetry. Great length too."
1,Bad design and manufacture,Placed the sleeve in the freezer. The plastic came out brittle and wouldn't fit on the bottle. Also cracked at a corner and began leaking.
1,terrible!!,"... this book was tedious. there are very few books that make me say, ""i'd rather be working!""you have to have a really high tolerance for italian art, or even art in general. a passing interest simply will not allow for an enjoyable read...."
1,Give me a break,"As usual, another non-informational/dis-informational book; for example descriptions of PCP usage, which is considered a ""dis-associative"" NOT a true hallucinogen. Instead of this smut, read ""From Chocolate to Morphine"" by DR. Andrew Weil; which is truly an informational read, especially good for the teenagers."
1,Propagandic Garbage,OK let's keep our childred off of drugs this will be a good thing for all of course but keep them off with the truth........scare tactics will work on the weak minded but shouldn't people know the truth and make their own choices. DEFINITELY CHOOSE ANOTHER BOOK ON THIS TOPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Terrible... Don't bother... This is so slow, it's annoying...","After giving us a great mono version of this work (even with HUGE cuts, that are completely unnecessary) with the Leningrad orchestra on DG, Sanderling proves that lightning does not strike twice in the same place.This is so slow, I almost thought someone opened the score to Parsifal on the desk for the conductor.Don't waste your money on this turkey. I sold my copy for used and will not miss the misery it gave me... UGH"
4,The Catcher was a Spy,"A surprising story that is today little known. A major league ball player who was an ardent reader and linguist, and who served to seek out word of German nuclear research during WWII. I frecommend it. I receivbed prompt delivery from the bookseller who supplied it."
2,very slow,"Although their are very interesting parts to this book, it is very dull overall. Very slow and jumps back and forth too much. Their are so many names it is hard to keep everything straight. I just don't think that this is a story that is very easy to put into print and maintain good flow."
3,Its a book you finish just because you started it,"Maybe I am too young to appreciate Moe Berg but halfway through the book I wasn't sure I even liked Moe Berg anymore or cared about reading more about him. Its storyline seems intersting enough but eventually you begin to question what is true and what is hear say. A fried of mine said he loved it but then again he is atleast 55 yrs old and was more familiar with the people (baseball players) involved. The book or should I say the material got dry, boring and had me thinking ""I just don't care anymore"" I couldn't tell if Moe Berg was full of BS, the people the author spoke with, or if I was just expecting too much to actually get any concrete answers as to what he was really doing. Bottom line if you find the book at a library book sale for $2-$5 (as I did) then yeah go ahead, if not just leave it alone."
3,Long read,The book drones on. I struggled with the overall length and tiny font.Unsure as to why Moe Berg is so important. His celebrity seems to be manufactured.
3,A lot of research--was it worth it?,"I must give credit to the author for the exhaustive research that must have gone into this book. However, I can't help but think the effort put into solving the ""mystery"" of Moe Berg was wasted. As was said in the prologue by a disgruntled book store owner: ""The only mystery about Moe Berg is that there is no mystery."" And it's true. He was a second-rate baseball player, a second-rate scholar, and a second-rate spy who briefly had an important role. Of course, Moe Berg wanted people to believe he was important. He led friends to believe that he still worked for the CIA even though the agency had gotten rid of him decades earlier. Berg created and perpetuated his own legend. Now he has a book."
2,Great research--was it worth it?,"The author exhaustively researched this book--talking to hundreds, going through old papers, Berg's notes, etc.--but the reader must question if Berg was really deserving of a 300 hundred page book. Berg was a second-rate catcher, a second-rate scholar, and a second-rate spy who had a brief moment of significance. I must agree with the disgruntled shopkeeper in the prologue: ""The only mystery about Moe Berg is that there is no mystery."" It's true. Berg created his own legend. He wanted people to think he was important. He led people to believe he was still in the CIA decades after he had been booted out. Did we really need a book on Moe Berg? Probably not."
5,great book,"Bought this book for a gift; apparently, it's a great read for the young adult in your life!"
3,And Hollywood is making a movie about him in 1999!,"I could not believe it but... yes the Moe Berg movie is under development for 1999 by Miramax. I agree with most of the other reviews that we all question the significance of his accomplishments. If he was not a catcher (or a Jew) this book may have never been written. With all of the author's research he was unable to be difinitive in judging the significant accomplishments or character of Moe Berg. Please, Miramax, take this movie's budget a feed a small thrid-world country!"
2,Not a pleasant person,"Moe Berg was completely unpleasant. I found myself wondering why I should care about his life. He was a mediocre ballplayer, a mediocre scholar and a mediocre spy. His talent was that he was pleasant to be around. Why write a book about him?Why read about him? I wondered that. My reaction was, ""So what?"""
2,First Book Ever I Couldn't Finish,"The relaying of the historical data was somewhat interesting but you get the idea Moe Berg thought a bit too highly of himself, as does Nicholas Dawidoff. I have never been unable to drag myself through a book - there's a first time for everything. I just couldn't go on after making it 3/4 of the way through. Disappointing."
4,Really sweet and funny!,"God I love authors whose footnotes are as great as the rest of the text!!John Green has nailed interesting and intellectual in fiction! I love his stuff; and this book is my favorite thus far. The more I read of it the more I was into it until pretty quickly I was dreading that it had no sequel (I was barely halfway through it at that point).It is smart, funny, and relate-able. Great book. I wish it were 10 times as long so I was still reading it! (an ending I felt good about too)phoebe anne(As a result of the author and his brother Hank, I'm a member of nerdfighters.ning.com.)"
4,smart read,"this is one of the smartest teen novels ive read in a while...green is an awesome writer, and he proves his skill in this book"
4,"so simple, yet riveting","Colin Singleton is a child prodigy with a thing for girls named Katherine. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have the same ""thing"" for him.This story is all about character development. And even though we know which way Colin's character is going to develop, we don't know how it's going to happen, making this book predictable in unpredictable ways. Ironic, since part of the story is about predicting relationships. Quite clever. :)This book is proof that one can successfully write a non-edgy YA novel. And it was laugh-out-loud-funny in many places. A definite re-read is in the future."
3,"Read ""The Fault in Our Stars"" instead","I tried this novel because ""The Fault in Our Stars"" was so enjoyable! ""Katherines"" isn't nearly as good, and I probably wouldn't bother with it. I liked the 2 main characters at the beginning, and the dialogue was interesting and funny. It just seemed to lose steam as it progressed, and one sex scene makes it inappropriate for many teens that otherwise might have enjoyed the story."
5,Best of John Green.,"LOVE!I tend to enjoy John Green's novels, and this one is my new favorite. If you're looking for a book with believable high school seniors as the main characters, plenty of humor and smart wordplay, deep thoughts, plus a fair bit of road-trip adventure, then Green's your guy and An Abundance of Katherines will keep you turning pages.And I admire the skill with which this author can integrate ideas and facts from history, science, math, literature, and the arts without ever seeming forced or preachy.So rare to find young adult books that read just as engrossingly for adults. Thank you, Mr. Green, for coming through for us all once again."
4,The fault in our stars,"This was an amazing,amazing book and I love John greens personality when he writes and the way you can get lost in the book."
2,not the YA for adults everyone said it would be,"this was the second book by john green i read. the good thing was that it only took about half a day to finish. i can hardly remember the last book i read that was such a breeze. besides the fact that it's intended for a young adult audience, the easy to read quality obviously have something to do with green's ability to control the flow of a narrative as well. his is a very clean style and gently nudges you to continue even if you're not in love with it right away. i never did fall in love with it, but it's commendable that i was at least persuaded to finish. i can't say what it was but it just wasn't enough."
3,Worthwhile read,"John Green being one of my favorite authors, I decided to order a complete set of all his books. Katherines didn't disappoint me, per se, but at the same time it didn't completely thrill me. Upon finishing, I was satisfied, not jubilant. That being said, I still recommend this book for the high-school/college/young adult, though it pales in comparison to Green's TFiOS."
5,love it,This is a great book by John Green. I highly recommend it to young adult readers. I really enjoyed the footnotes and how involved the reader is in this book.
1,Kindle version lacks footnotes,"The story is great but people should check to see if the footnotes will appear in Kindle version. The story includes a lot of funny, sarcastic or informative footnotes and when I purchased the book on my Kindle (new Kindle 2011), the footnotes did not appear. Amazon did refund the money without any trouble."
4,Playful and Fun,"This was a great coming-of-age book. What a playful, fun story. The abundance of footnotes were a little annoying on the Kindle, but nothing that took away from the book. I love how the author worked in a lot of smartypants topics without being too verbose or boring. The whole concept of creating an algorithm to predict relationships is so fun.Love John Green now officially and will definitely be reading through his other books."
2,Lame and boring,"What a terrible book! The characters were unlikeable, the plot was predictable, and the premise of 19 ex-girlfriends named Katherine was too ridiculous for me to believe in the story. I thought ""show, don't tell"" is just a writing tip learned in elementary school, but John Green could have used it: the main character spends the whole book analyzing himself and others to no end. I kept giving it chances, but in the end I regretted wasting any time reading it."
3,"Great book, not-so-great condition","John Green is one of my all-time favorite authors, and I love this book, so I had to order my own copy instead of just borrowing it from the library over and over again.The book arrived on time, but the spine was bent in a few places. I can still read the book, but it's not incredibly aesthetically pleasing with the paper ridged up at the top. That's my only complaint."
5,An Abundance of Katherines,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. John Green is a litature genius. John and his brother Hank are soooo funny just like his book. If you want to laugh really hard check out their video blogs. Trust me, read this book!"
2,KATERINE? KATERINE?,"I can say with such abundant honesty that it hurts, that this book is nothing short of literary trash. First off, the premise is, quite frankly, retarded. Some supposed former child-prodigdy thinks that he can make such a complicated algorithm, one that would require an innumerable amount of variables to consider, only to come to the inevitable conclusion that he can't. Big surprise. Honestly, I don't understand how this book is given anything other than a passing mention amongst any community. It's also written in a style that's reminiscent of a 40 year old man trying to write ""hip"" and be ""in with the kids."" It's patronizing drivel. I hate everything about this book, and I honestly would rather eat dog feces than re-read this garbage. John Green can take a big one, and he should, for producing such terrible material. - Ian."
1,too much sex and swearing for a young teanager,"My son, who is 15 years old, started this book and quit. He said there is too much sex and swearing -- about every other page. The reviews I had read made this book sound funny, and he said it did seem like it was humorous -- but he stopped reading it because of the all the sexual references and bad language."
3,Hmm,"Honestly, I expected more after read The Fault in our Stars but it was still cute and funny. Worth reading (:"
4,Set Adrift,"It is very seldom indeed that an electronic album of this virtue comes along. Overwhelmingly atmospheric, Navigator challenges the listener in the way a good book will, to open the mind a take equal part in a journey whose destination may or may not be known by the author. See his side project with Haujobb: Newt"
3,Thinking Man's Industrial,"It is very obvious from the quality of the music that Forma Tadre put a lot of thought into what they do. Musically, all the songs are good and the lyrics are written well, but the vocalist has such an annoying voice it really detracts from the album overall. It sounds like he's singing at the back of his throat!! Maybe if he sang in his own language, instead of English, his voice might be more tolerable. Fans of Haujobb, Front 242 and Bigod 20 might do well to check this out for its similar but more refined musical sensibility"
2,Flimsy,That's it..they're flimsy and don't stay in the handle bars very well. Lasted about 2 hours on my 4 year old's bike. Now she just uses them like cheerleader pon poms.
4,Good Reference,"We homeschool and this has been a good reference (other than the internet). Nicely illustrated with photos, charts and graphs. The back is a handy section on Countries of the World."
5,Perfect,"This cd has everything. From emotional songs to party music. This band has the potential to be a really big thing, but it's a good thing. Cuase we wouldn't want a great band like this to be just another one of those worthless trendy bands. But I've been playing it places and everyone seems to love it. Excellent dance music. For metalheads or rappers. The percet cd by the prefect band."
1,Dissapointment,"This DVD was a disappointment. I expected more. The skills taught are certainly useful, but the instructor seemes to be barely capable himself. Much more material should be covered for the price."
5,Fantastic Skating Instruction,"This DVD is great! Excellent instruction that will take you from just beginning all the way to cross-over turns. Highly recommended. If you want to learn to skate correctly, get this video."
2,not a thorough instruction,"I was looking for a good visual instruction on inline skating. I am very disappointed by this DVD. The video has a home-made quality, which is not my major complaint. The content is more about a few skating tips rather than a thorough instruction from beginner skills to more advanced ones. I am a beginner, that is why I need good instructions. Some techniques such as A-turn, parallel turn, spin stop, scissors are not covered at all. The ones that do get mentioned, such as cross-over turn, the instructor does not provide information on where you should put your weight, what mistakes a beginner would typically make. Instead, he just shows you a few times. And that is it. So, if you want to watch a few minutes of a very good speed inline skater skates and shows you a few tips here and there, this video may be good for you. But if you are looking for a thorough instructional video, this is definitely not."
2,Not recommended for beginners,Good video to watch for a intermediate to advanced skater. There is too much to cover in how to skate properly. There was not enough time given to braking on skates. This video is best for those who are already comfortable how to stop confidently because he does not give too much time explaining all the beginner concepts and foundations.I would not expect a beginner to be able to go down a hill like the instructor.
2,Not as good as hoped,"I ordered this video over a year ago, and while I think the instructor had some very good intentions; I think people should know what this video is however. It is an amateur video with background noise shot at public locations. More than that, I'm a technical person so I had hoped for more detail and discussion about common errors and what to avoid.This tape had some good skating tips, but it's certainly not the best skating instructions ever."
4,Prob the best inline skating video for now,"There is alot you can knock about this DVD, home made, does not cover everything,but the acid test of wether it will make you a better skater if you are just starting out, or want to improve your technique, the answer is yes. As with all instructional DVD, it will not replace one to one tutor, but if that is not available, this is a good second choice."
3,"Good performance, bad CD sound quality","This is a great performance of Handel's Messiah. The large Mormon Tabernacle Choir makes for a powerful choral presentation. Unfortunately, the sound quality in this CD in not the best. The recording is in lower than usual volume and the sound quality becomes poor when the choir hits really high notes. The CD label says the recording was made in 1995 with ""the incredible new NTI EQ^3 High Definition Recording System."" I don't know much about music recording technology, but I'm not very impressed with this system. I think it would do the Tabernacle Choir well to produce a newer version of the Messiah."
4,The Riverboat Gambler,"'Favre 4 Ever' is a great look at one of the most storied quarterbacks in NFL history, Brett Favre. Examining his career from the start up until the 2006 season, it seems like a version 2.0 of this DVD will be required to show him breaking the all-time passing yards and touchdowns records, along with his incredible MVP-type 2007 season. If you are a Brett Favre and/or Packers fan and enjoy watching NFL documentaries, you will no doubt enjoy this solid release!!**** RECOMMENDED"
5,AWESOME,"One word describes it..........AWESOME!!!! WARNING though, this product will most likely cause you to grin from ear to ear one moment and shed a tear the next."
2,Not at all what I expected,"Someone suggested I buy this. I love trip hop, drum and bass, big beat, etc, but this doesn't quite know what it wants to be. It's not melodic, the beats are retreads and if I could get my money back, I would."
4,Be wary of musical number at beginning,"I recently acquired this tape and was dismayed to see a very bad musical number preceeding the cartoons. The tape is worth owning, but I would have preferred it if the musical number had been listed as being on the tape instead of waiting like a bad Halloween trick."
4,WALT DISNEY CLASSICS:HALLOWEEN HAUNTS-vhs,"I remember watching these 3 and more,when Wonderful World of Disney was on TV. I got 2 of them, just in case one of them was starting to break down.They both were in pretty good shape for how old they were. If only Disney would get it together and start putting all these classics on dvd.The two sights that I bought these from are truly Great to work with.They are very Honest."
3,Fun video for Halloween Season,Good compilation of Disney classic cartoons with a Halloween theme. These shorts are not available together on any DVD that I know of.
4,the perfect pafko,"What a first novel! I just loved this book! Rather like a refined Elmore Leonard or less catastrophe laden CJ Boyle. Skeeter and Herb were very clever. Brady's take on the rural South spot on and his Quixote-esque quest, plot perfect. The battle of the sexes was skillfully rendered (great job with Beth and Tanya). To an old Milwaukee Sentinel delivery boy and a Braves fan from the 50s, the baseball lore and images took me back to Milwaukee and my youth better than any class reunion ever could. Pafko by the pool is a splendid way to spend a day of your vacation."
5,Buy this book for your friends; they'll all enjoy it!,"What an entertaining, delightful first novel. I've been reading too many ""chick"" novels which tend to categorize men into lowly cardboard figures. Early in The Perfect Pafko, Robert Booth creates a real, interesting, complex main character in Brady Greer. Then, once readers get attached to Brady, we're taken on a unique road trip. People enter Brady's life to help him on his quest and the reader has to keep the pages turning. The book is humorous, quixotic, fast paced, and leaves the reader waiting for a sequel, or at least another novel.Grab a copy, I think you'll agree."
4,"Excellent, but it's an Outline","This work by Metrpolitan Kallistos Ware is incredibly clear and cogent on the topic of salvation in the Orthodox Christian understanding. The chapters progressively flow towards a deeper understanding of the concepts in the previous chapters. Undoubtedly, this work is invaluable for anyone seeking to preach or lecture on this topic. Be advised, however, that this is not a narrative book, so to speak, but rather, a collection of simple outlines. There are no paragraphs anywhere, but instead, collections of bullet points for each chapter. Personally, I do not think this affects the utility of this book, but nonetheless, I feel this is something buyers should know before ordering."
5,A Hardcore Masterpiece,"If you liked Battle Hymns, you'll love this one. From beginning to end, it's full-on rage played at a mind-numbing pace, with the last couple of songs slowing it down a bit. The entire CD is barely 30 minutes long but it's well worth your money. It's packed with amazing tracks, there are barely any fillers; as a matter of fact, i don't recall any. Just a violent, blistering attack on senses. A brilliant last album from an amazing band."
4,Good ass hXc Punk,"I've listened to TSM since 2000, picked up DBD after 2 years of wanting it and it ruled. Next I got Battle Hyms, which also ruled. When I check out their newer albums online I was disapointed to see a good punk band go comercial (again). But they came back with A Match, would've bought it but I was broke. When War Profiteering came out I had to get it (thank god I had a job by then). Picked it up @ Rasputin with Exodus' Shovel Headed Kill Machine and Lamb of God's Killadelphia.I may be a metal head but hXc Punk/ska is where I started. Black Flag, Minor Threaat, TSOL, and The DKs are still appart of my everyday listening. I can confidently say that this album is verry much Hardcore Punk with some Ska. If all punk bands were this heavy (or heavier) nowadays I'd be happy. Even so I know REAL punk will never make the Billboards, but this is still a kick ass album."
3,"Decent, not amazing","This album isn't as good as Decoder, which is the best Noise Unit release IMO. It is a darker album and the beats attempt to be more interesting, but I find that the songs don't really have as good a coherency as they could have had... for me, the sampled guitar was not a welcome addition -- it only detracts from the rest of the music in the context of the songs on this album (I really liked the sampled guitar on Millenium, for example -- it fit there). This album is okay, but there are plenty of other much better albums. It's a shame that the songs fall apart so much and get boring on repeated listens -- Decoder was such a great album that I was expecting more than this... especially with the addition of Haujobb to the list of people helping create it..."
3,jumpsnap,"This is a decent product and does what it says it will. You can use it to jumprope in a very small space. it does not keep exact track of your jumps because you have to be able to twirl the handles perfectly. But, other than that, no complaints."
2,Nice idea but didn't live up to the hype,"Was able to use the JumpSnap, but every time I wanted to utilize the counter I had to remove and replace the batteries. This wouldn't have been so bad, but the battery compartment was closed with a screw so I needed to carry a screwdriver with me in order to really use the item. After doing this several times I decided to return the item rather than continue to reset the batteries every time."
4,excellent cardio alternative,"Dont have 45 min to do cardio? this is an excellent alternative for a quick pick me up. Burn almost twice as many calories in half the time. Havent used the dvd's as of yet but not big on any excercise dvd product. Definitely reccomend these for anyone specifically for those with little time but want to burn as many calories in 15 min as in 45 min of walking. Gave only 4 stars due to the odor of the foam at the end of the ropes, takes getting used to."
2,JumpSnap Failure,So I received the product on 11/7/2012. Today is 11/14/2012. After 3 uses the product is now non-responsive. Of course I assumed it was the cheap batteries included with the product. So I replaced them with new energizer batteries. Still .. no response. The product has been kept in the white box it came in after each use. Very disappointed as I was enjoying the work out. Returning it tomorrow so on the hunt for a new product ropeless jumper. *sighing*
1,jumpsnap,"I ordered Jump snap and it was the biggest mistake I ever made, it is a piece of junk and I do not know how it can be given away. It will go in my next garage sale for 25 cents, not sure if I can get that for it."
2,Rope Needed,This is one gift I regret buying. I was told it is too complicated to use and not credible without a rope. It is not something I would recommend.
4,Good Product,"Just getting started using the JumpSnap. Very easy to use as far as putting in the time, weight etc. I'm having a little trouble matching the clicks with my jumps; I jump more than it clicks. But it does get me off my duff and doing something and it's a big reward to see how many jumps I did and how many calories I burned in my allotted time. My aim was to do a lot of cardio in a short amount of time and it definitely does that. I'm very satisfied with the product."
3,false advertisement,"It only came with 1 DVD, the picture shows four. I thought I was getting a little more for my money."
3,Jumping Rope is a tough workout,"I purchased JumpSnap because I have a home with low ceilings and wanted to be able to jump in my home.It was challenging for me to get into this. I don't know if I am jumping at the right time or not. It truly does snap, but I still don't know if I jumped at the right time or not.I think it is great that it comes with varying weights for inside the handles so that you can increase your workout when ready.It is great that you can enter your weight and it will calculate the amount of jumps and give you an estimated number of calories burned.The video is cheesy. It does show you different jump steps which is interesting.Overall I guess if I was better at it I might enjoy it more."
3,Good concept,This product is a great idea. I thought that it would help me stick to exercising inside without worry over hitting the ceiling fans. It does what it is supposed to do but you do have to use it. I'm not sure it is worth the $ but works if you use it.
3,Got the wrong color,the ropeless jump rope is proving to be a nice exercise piece of equipment so far. I have no complaints with the system or the video. My complaint is with Amazon.com after I specifically ordered the blue one but got the pink one anyway.
3,ok,"I purchased this because jumping rope is a great workout but I just didn't have the room for the rope......I used it a few times and it's OK, but for some reason I didn't feel the full effect I feel when I use the real deal......If you want the real workout...skip the jump snap and get a regular jumprope (its cheaper!!) I used it just a few times and now it's stored away...."
2,Great Price,Great Price and super fast shipping but got board of this product fast. Would rather save up some more money and buy and exercise bike
1,Ropeless rope misses the mark.,This was not received well. A bad gift choice. It was deemed too complicated and not motivating enough without a real rope.Sorry..... Too expensive to boot!
1,Don't buy this battery!,"Digipower's website claims 1120mAh battery.Amazon claims 900mAh battery.Packaging claims 850mAh battery.Packaging says: ""Replacement for CANON NB-5L.NOWAY - HOZAY.So what moron is going to read this and buy this battery.Canon Powershot SD900 specifies 1120mAh battery, and it sellsonly this value.Don't get snarfed by these Chinese cookie monsters!(""Ha-ha-ha Merican consumer...no care bout quality...you buyour junk...gimme quick...only words read are Britney Spears, O.J....ha-ha-ha"")(Humor courtesy of Sundance Film Festival)Shame on these bozos! ...and BestBuy for selling this crapola.If you go into a BestBuy and see one of these batteries, rated for 850mAh (see back of package)...tell them they are noda*ned good. They should pull them all...right now!But they won't. See for yourself.I hope I'm not being too laid back here."
1,not worth it,The battery doesn't even last 1 year before it stops taking a charge and dies. Don't waste your money.
1,Lakewood heaters = High failure rate - lost 4 in 3 years!,"Bought locally over the last 3 years, all four of the Lakewood oil filled heaters (models 5500 & 5600) that I owned have failed. Luckily one was only 2 weeks old and I was able to take it back to the store I bought it from. Believe it or not one other person was in the return line with one that was only about 1 week old. Some curious customer, that just bought one, asked what was wrong with them and we both encouraged him to return it immediately and get a different brand...he stayed in line with us and got his money back. I am hanging on to the two bad ones I still have and will seek out others with similar experience for possible legal action.Buy a Lakewood and it will cost you money!"
1,Avoid this product,"I used one for two years and then its thermostat failed. Subsequently I learned that a number of these heaters reportedly have caused injuries by squirting hot oil through failed welds, and that the manufacturer has gone out of business. I would not recommend buying or using this product, and am discarding the two units we have at home."
3,The Starfleet Strategy Guide is misnamed.,"If you are looking for cheat codes or scenario enhancements this guide is not for you. The book is not really a strategy guide per say,it is more of a walk through guide of the missions. It gives information on each simulation you go through with a few strategy tips as how to stay alive a little longer. Some are more common sense than strategy, such as do flybys on enemies when attacking to stay out of their firing arcs. The areas it totally ignores are the extensive video sequences where you interact with the other actors through multiple choice responses. You may not think this would be a major point, but the way you answer in the game can make the difference in how well respected by your crew and the command staff you will be.This is intergral as to your scores as the completing of the simulations successfully. Needless to say as strategy guides go I'd have to rate this one as mediocre at best."
3,It's a little bigger than I expected.,"I was hoping for a smaller camera but I am going to keep this and get to know it. The instruction manual is okay, I was a bit dissapointed in the rebound time it takes the camera to recover from taking a photograph. My Kodak cheapo Easy Share was better at rebound. The ""Burst"" feature that allows the person to take multiple pics in a row is still a bit difficult for me. I am mostly dissapointed in the size. This is not nearly close to a micro or mini sized camera but at least it isn't bulky and the price is very fair from Amazon. Hopefully I'll have a better review after owning it a month or so. Hope this helps."
4,Lumix is good.,"This camera was great! I used it for a couple years and it takes just as good of pictures as my current camera, which is 10 megapixels. Battery life was horrible, even if you turned off the display, which I did often. That is the only drawback and is why I switched cameras after 3 years with this one."
4,"Nice, but could be updated.","I finally decided to splurge the $10 and see what this little bio had to offer. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. It gave me some interesting information and it was a lot better than I expected. I am a die-hard Richie Tankersley Cusick fan, so in my opinion, this was worth the $10 spent. The only thing I didn't like was that it hasn't been updated since 2003 so her newest novels are missing. Also, I wonder if things have changed since then. If there is ever an updated version, I would love to read it."
3,Not a lot of variety,"Yes, there are 30 dolls in this, but the primary variation is how you finish the face and the color or pattern of socks you use.Also note these are dolls ONLY, there is not any animals or other creatures. The slight exception is two of the sock dolls are in costume, one is a lion.There are good directions so if you are looking for only dolls then you may find some fresh ideas.I expected more variety and some unique creations."
5,"Simple, fun and tremendously helpful for newbies!","I debated about whether or not to buy this book for quite a while. One day, I happened to see it on sale for a great price so I snatched it up. I couldn't be happier! I must say, before I bought this book, I didn't know much about hand-sewing at all. This book teaches basic hand stitches with easy drawings and diagrams. Even though the projects are incredibly simple, it's helped me tremendously in other advanced sewing projects. Also, the dolls are ADORABLE. Who would've thought you could make precious little dolls from socks? LOL I've already made a couple of them and I'm so pleased at how they look. I can't recommend this book highly enough. If you're already a seasoned seamstress, you'll still have fun making these precious little dolls in your spare time."
4,I always worry......(and needlessly in this case),"Sometimes with GREAT bands, there comes a time where good albums stop being made and you end up getting only a few songs here or there but the albums as a whole tend to be not so good. This was the mindset i had going in with Sleepwalker as it was to me, past the era of Kinks i love the best. (66 thru 74) I was very much pleased however when i picked up this album after checking out samples via You Tube about how good it really is! Solid guitar work, good lyrics and in general just a really good later seventies album. I shouldn't be surprised as the Kinks ARE an amazing band....but to me, this very well could be the last great Kinks album!"
1,anti-scientific sensationalist trash for the gullible,"Before ANYONE buys this book, please just ask yourself one simple question: ""do I want to be thought an idiot by people who are not idiots?"" If the answer is a heartfelt ""no"", then take the next step and read this: [...]. Read the dissection of Gary Schwartz's methodology (or lack of one) and you'll understand that this ""scientific"" analysis is anything but, and that in fact Mr. Schwartz must have had a solidly established bias in favor of the existence of an afterlife before he began writing the book.The only use for such a book is in helping the public understand the modern epidemic of profiteers distorting and co-opting the entire idea of science - a good cautionary tale and nothing more."
2,SAVE YOU'RE MONEY,"OK, SO I READ THIS BOOK EVEN THOUGH I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO FINISH IT. BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I DON'T SEE WHERE THIS 'BREAKTHOUGH SCIENTFIC EVIDENCE' IS. ITS JUST 5 MEDIUMS DOING READINGS IN A CONTROLLED ENVIROMENT. THEY DO READINGS WHERE THEY NEVER MEET THE SITTER, NEVER SEE, NOR HEAR THEM. BUT I WILL SAY THAT ONE THING THIS BOOK DOES IS IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHERE THE MEDIUMS ARE GETTING THEIR INFORMATION FROM. THOUGH THE INFORMATION THEY 'RETRIVE' TO ME IS NOT CONVINCING. I NEED SOMETHING MORE. I WOULD RATHER READ UP ON NDE'S. WHEN IT COMES TO MEDIUMS I'M STILL NOT CONVINCED. BUT BY SAYING THAT I'M NOT IMPLYING THESE MEDIUMS ARE FULL OF IT. JUST THAT THIS SUBJECT ON MEDIUMS COULD USE MORE RESEARCH."
4,paranormal,"Because Gary Schwartz was/is an academic and skeptic before this book, this read is all the more believable. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the paranormal."
4,An Old Topic Made New Again,"The book presents the results of a scientific experiment carried out by scientists at the Univesity of Arizona, concerning the possibility of communication with the dead. To be sincere, to those interested in the topic, this kind of research is nothing new: Asakof, Crookes, Lombroso, De La Roche, Kardec and others had done that over 2 centuries ago (and not to detract from the present author, much better than he has). However, it is refreshing to see the topic revisited -- especially when portrayed in a very soft, non-academic writing style that makes it easy to read. It should be a good stepping stone to other, more complete works. It also has a good last chapter, about the implications of such findings -- the most important aspect of the whole thing (which is often let aside in most contemporary works of the same kind). I would definitively recommend it."
5,Following a scientist's personal journey,"New research and breakthroughs on the scientific evidence for life after death are revealed in The Afterlife Experiments, a title following a scientist's personal journey from skepticism to belief. The difference between this and competitors: a series of rigidly monitored experiments backed with scientific protocol to reveal the results of mediums who claim to be bringing voices from beyond the grave."
1,Terrible,"Incredibly biased book. These 'scientific experiments' are not scientific at all. He is trying to convince us throughout the entire book, not looking objectively at the subject matter. Very disappointed. Was very Christian based, rather than scientifically oriented."
3,Pseudo-science... but very good pseudo science,"I found the book to be both entertaining and enlightening. I came away with the belief that these experiences were real and meaningful to all the participants.I was disappointed, however, in the level of science that was represented in the work. Dr. Schwartz is not coy about setting out to arrive at a predetermined conclusion. Such passion rarely survives the scrutiny of objective review. The accounts in the book speak for themselves. The references to scientific method are inaccurate and a distraction."
1,boring...too much personal info,"I don't really care about the background info on this man and his life, where he has worked...yadda yadda...it takes about 20 pages until it gets interesting and really into SUBJECT MATTER...unfortunately I've already lost interest..."
3,Interesting but rambling,"The details of the ""experiments"" are interesting but the author goes on and on and on about himself which drags the book out to about twice the length it should be."
1,This book is only for unscientific ...,This book would be a funny joke if it were not for the fact that too many confuse this book with scientific research. This book is not scientific and its numerous research flaws have been documented by many other scientists and scientific organizations.
1,"Undeniable evidence of telepathy, but not of afterlife","This book is well written and seems to have good intentions, but fails in its main purpose. Its method of research proves only the existence of telepathy, not life after death."
2,I did not like this book,In all fairness I only read about 10% of this book before I started going stark raving mad from the lack of anything interesting. Just a bunch of blah blah blah to me. So maybe it gets better later into the book but I just deleted it from my device and will move on.
1,Disappointing,This is a book that consists of descriptions of meetings between mediums and subjects with supposedly dramatic revelations. From this we are to conclude that there is scientific evidence of an afterlife. Sound like hogwash? Well it is.Let me tell you that reading about mediums in a book is like watching magicians on TV. It doesn't work. I found this book and its author to be tedious at best. For this guy to imply that people who make there living this way somehow constitute evidence of the hereafter is ridiculous.Obviously written for those that want mightily to believe and are willing to grasp onto almost anything.
1,More pseudoscience,from dishonest hucksters preying on the hopes and fears of the uneducated masses who do not understand the scientific method.
4,"Proved something, but not everything","Dr Schwartz has proved beyond reasonable doubt that ""mediums"" have extraordinary power to tell events from a person's life and family history without ever having even met that person. What he has not proven is how they are able to do it. His speculation is that human consciousness survives after death and communicates with us. He needs to prove it. Continued research will provide us the answers.The book is highly readable for anyone who takes a little effort. Whether or not the living soul is true, there are valuable lessons for life we could take from this book. The first lesson will be the importance to be open minded to the possibility that human soul could exist after death in a form hitherto unexplained by organized religions."
5,Recommended,"Dr. Schwartz has worked with noted mediums such as George Anderson, John Edward, and Suzanne Northrop, as well as mediums with shorter professional practice.His work is often cited as something that might approach a scientific ""proof"" of afterlife, mediumship contact, similar to what Dr. Ian Stevenson performed in his work related to the topic of reincarnation associated with the Univeristy of Virginia."
2,"Get ""Escape To Reality"" instead","In a word, disappointing.There are two factors that make this album a let down. The first is that many of the songs get monotonous and 'blippy'. The same childish melodies over the same percussion over and over and over.... There just isn't enough variety to keep things interesting.The second problem is the awful voxing. I thought that the vox in Esacpe To Reality was bad. Trust me, it is better than this! Here, the voice sounds like Dani Filth on Amphetamines mixed with the sound of sandpaper on metal.What does save the album, however, are two excellent songs. These are ""Piss Christ"" and ""Terminal Condition."" However, the rest of the album is quite boring. Try VNV Nation or Velvet Acid Christ for a more intriguing listen. If you like Da5id's projects, however, you may get this."
3,Cynical and funny,"I first read this book at the age of twenty two prompted by my appreciation for ""North Dallas Forty"". Although I enjoyed it, I was left feeling unsatisfied. After just finishing it again at the age of forty, I am suprised by how much it improved in eighteen years. My appreciation for Gent's humor has grown. Consistently cynical, it is also often hilarious. Although not a native Texan, Gent understands the culture. Although some of his characters are exaggerated there is a basis of truth in them. The book is a funny commentary on our celebrity culture and the time it was written (late seventies). Anyone who remembers that time (especially in Texas) will enjoy it."
3,GREAT MUSICIANS/POOR RECORDING,"I certainly don't regret the purchase of this music, but the quality of the recording could have been alot better! As for the performance, it's pure jazz from 2 great legends! Breau fans, Lenny sounds as if he was at his peak!"
5,The Matt Urban Story hardcover book,"I have 1 copy already and wanted a second. It is a fantastic book about a fantastic American hero. Unbeknownst to most people Audie Murphy was not the most decorated soldier in world war 2, Matt Urban was. Highly recommend to everyone."
5,Great Commentary,"This is a great commentary for anyone who's not a biblical scholar. It is easy to read and actually quite interesting. It's the only commentary I've read that I could actually sit down and read cover to cover. He doesn't use Greek every third word, so it's easy to follow even if you have no Greek knowledge. A great commentary for your average Joe who's just looking for some more information on the book of Romans. Happy studies."
5,Horses,"This is a very pretty picture. The light seems to shine through it and I can almost feel like I am there, away from my cares."
4,Second ime's a charm,"The first one came with a broken lid hinge, missing parts and too many problems to note. Amazon replaced it with no problem and the second one has been great. We use this as our main grill until we can afford a bigger one. Then, it will be used just what it's made for - taking everywhere. I would like the grill to be easier to fit into the box, but overall I really like it. Handle gets too hot to carry once its been going, so a glove is good to take with it."
3,A Psychological Thriller without Thrills,"A Spanish ""thriller"" that lacks thrills but is a well played story. The film itself is visually compellling, the acting above mediocre, but the plot rather thin.No Alfred Hitchcock, and certainly not memorable, this film, La Promesa is an okay way to spend 2 forgettable hours."
3,Reasonably good.,I bought this film simply because I discovered that Carmen Maura was in it.Other reviewers have provided a good synopsis of the movie so no need for a repeat.I will only add that I thought this movie was a bit long and possibly due to her role and/or dialogue I did not feel the magic that I usually do when watching Carmen Maura perform. She is one of my favorite actresses but this movie lacked somewhat.If an unknown actress played this role the film would probably not be worth seeing. Carmen helped make the movie work but I felt as though this role pulled her down.
3,Average,"A very short book. I was disappointed with the length. It was not researched enough to really understand what type of man Buchanan was. I think any person elected to be President should be studied in depth. This book is more like a high school history book. Not really what I was looking for understanding Buchanan the man. Buchanan gets a ""bum deal"" by history and this book does nothing to help him."
3,#15,"Jean Baker's basic premise in this biography is that, despite his training and experience, James Buchanan was ill-equipped to stop the Civil War from happening and, in fact, may have contributed to it. She is mostly successful, but she doesn't succeed in making Buchanan appear to be a compelling person - maybe because he just isn't one. Recommended for a good background on Buchanan."
3,Perhaps the worst president?,"President Buchanan is a case study for how not to lead and how not to build a senior executive team. Where President Lincoln is known as the president who saved the US, President Buchnanan is the one that destroyed the old model.This book shows how he surrounded himself with leaders who were trying to help him win re-election and he allowed them to destroy the nation. He is an example of the leader who surrounds himself with yes man and brown nosers instead of those that look out for the best results for the organization. In Buchanan's case, he truly can be viewed as a traitor who did not protect the constitution. He had executives that stole money, stole weapons, stole property and worse. The incident in Kansas stole a state government. Clearly a shameful man that if studied should help many a CEO make better decisions on organization building based not on Machiavellians but competance."""
3,forward thinking,"Richard Bucky Fuller was this centuries most forward thinking individual in my opinion. Reading through Earth Inc. I could see where people could be somewhat turned off by Bucky's radical viewpoints I think he needs to be read with an open mind, and heart."
1,Worst Customer Support!,"I haven't used this card, so this is more of a review of this company. This company has the worst customer support I have ever seen. You need to think twice if you ever consider buying one of their products."
3,Not great,"Not a whole lot of innovation, some out of tune singing. I like the older James Hall much better (i.e., We are at War)"
5,Absolutely Rocking,"I can't figure out why this album has stayed so far under the radar because it is phenomenal. IMO the best tracks are ""No Joy, No Strength,"" ""Since I Laid My Burdens Down,"" & ""That's What He's Done."" However, there are definitly more hitting songs on the album other than these. This is a very ""churchy"" album, songs that the majority of Sunday morning choirs can learn very easily. If you're in the mood for a great choir album, sew a seed into their ministry for this CD and be blessed!"
5,Very complete book of the Yorkshire Terrier,"This is a very good book. If I could only get one book this is the book I would buy. Book has 17 chapters 346 pages. Covers everything you would want to know about this breed. Lots of colored pictures. Discusses the history, who's who in the fancy, showing, grooming, breeding , selecting puppy , puppy care, career in dogs."
1,2005 Guide to Federal Grants and Government Assistance,"Don't waste your money, this CD set is just a bunch of static pages from government web sites that can just as easily accessed by any search engine. I am returning this post haste."
5,"Versatile, inexpensive, adapable storage solution","This bag is the greatest, it is made of the same fiber reinforced material that they use for those ubiquitous white, red and blue plaid bags that are used in India, Russia, the Middle East and other countries instead of luggage or canvas tote bags.The handles are sewn and reinforced and are certainly strong enough if you are storing wreaths or comforters but I would hesitate to carry the bag by the handles if used to store books, heavy toys or sports equipment. I bought on sale but they are certainly worth considerably more and I will purchase more of these rather than the Rubbermaid bins. Great for carting things back and forth to a summer cottage, to college or camp.These bags are much larger than expected even though I looked at the measuremnts. To me that's a plus."
4,My son loves this unconventional book.,"Not your typical picture book ending, my son likes to chorus ""Whatever!"" as we read. He thinks it's hysterical, but my daughter finds this book offensive! It makes me chuckle-- I gave it as a gift to my friend with a sense of humore."
1,NOT a child's book.,I was most shocked by the path this book took. Todays childrens books seem to just get better and better but this book is awful. It begins with a child with a bad attitude and ends with a father who doesn't care.This book has no redeeming feature at all.
3,good introductory stuff but not enough solid info,"This is a nice book for someone who is THINKING about gettin a conure. There is plenty there about different kinds of conures, what kind of behavior to expect, what type of cage to get, etc. Unfortunately, if you already have one, there isn't enough solid, tested information on things like symptoms and behaviors, things that are keys to understanding what your bird needs. I was hoping to see something on how to get rid of bad behaviors, how to properly interact with the bird to avoid them, but found very little on that. I'd also like to see some in-line references to other reading material - instead I ended up spending barely an hour reading this book and put it away with almost as many questions as I had before."
3,Decent Book,"Book has general knowledge of different breeds of conures. Most of the information on housing, training etc is very general. The parts regarding diet are very good. The book is helpful for the most part, but lacks more in depth information. This was the first book I bought when I got my conure. I plan on buying a few more books to round out my knowledge."
5,Very helpful tool for a new conure owner!,This little book is full of vital information for anyone considering owning a conure. There are many ways that these birds are accidently killed. The more you know the better you will enjoy your new family member for many years to come.The book came in great condition and in a timely manner. The price was a find too.
3,Conure Behavior Information,"I just owned my green cheek conure for a week, I read many books and research online before purchasing.However, I found most books do not cover the behavior problems of a conure and how to tackle those issues.Overall this book provide a good overview of conures and basic steps to prepare for owning a conure."
3,A half decent game for a not so decent price,"If this game was 19.99 it would be worth the money.the graphics on this game are ok, the controls arent very good and the gameplay itself isnt all that great for an FPS. If you have to have a WWII type FPS go for meal of honor. It provides for a much better gaming experiance"
4,Very good approach although lacks of something ...,"Very good approach on this game although lacks of further details on art, probably extras that could shine this game compared probably with Medal of Honor: Heroes, however, it is still a good game that values to have it !! ...."
1,Worst Customer Service ever experienced .....,"Don't want to deal with this service provider again in the future. Don't be fooled by their Terms of service agreement(which is 10 pages long) and read the fine print carefully before accepting the service. They charge for everything and ridiculosly charge you a disconnection fee of $40 if you decided to get rid of them, Be careful and think twice before trying this service.I am glad to see that Amazon pulls this item from their inventory :)"
1,"Vonage is good, this VTA is not","If you are considering using Vonage, avoid this router. On my network it would occasionally cause the WAN connection to drop (although my LAN connection would be fine). This meant I couldn't access the Internet sporadically. When I removed the VT1005v from my network, it worked fine. It did not matter if I had the unit in front of the firewall or behind it.If you put the unit in front of your firewall, you'll run into a host of other problems. Its port forwarding interface is awful with very few options, and the DMZ option it gives doesn't work.When the system was not dropping my Internet connection, it worked fine. I have no complaints with Vonage. This phone adapter, on the other hand, is terrible."
1,Vonage terrible customer service,"If you are sure Vonage will work with your ISP, go for it. But if not, beware! I ended up wasting over $150 and many hours of dealing with their technical support staff only to find out that Vonage is not compatible with my ISP. Their customer service is terrible. They don't respond to e-mails and the phone service is slow and poor."
1,Very poor quality compared to Packet8,"I tried Vonage and the quality was terrible. I couldn't hear the person at the other end half the time. Then I tried Packet8 and it worked perfectly. I've had my Packet8 plugged in for months and never had to reboot it even once. The Vonage always froze up - sometimes in the middle of a call. Needless to say, I sent it back. Not recommended at all. Packet8 works much better with quality thats even better than my regular phone line."
1,I Agree - Worst Possible Service,"I too had a horrible experience when I needed help to set up service. After hours waiting on the phone and getting a different answer every time, I cancelled service. I still have not gotten a credit on my credit card and it has been 6 weeks. I have been calling about this and again, 15-30 minutes wait time and a different excuse every time. Unless you have a lot of free time on your hands and want to spend it on hold waiting for a Vonage representative who will say anything to get rid of you, DON'T SIGN UP."
2,Misfits is just that,"Not saying there aren't good things here. Rock'nRoll Fantasy is as good as anything they've ever done, but the reviewers here seem to be close to rabid in their passion for the Kinks.It's a good record. A few good Ray Davies' societal watchdog things. The title track is awesome, but only Rock'n'Roll Fantasy comes close to the promise of that song. After that, it gets entertaining but pedestrian. Let's be clear here, I really like the Kinks. Something Else is an all-time Top Ten pick, and I'm a staunch defender of Phobia. But Misfits is no such classic. A fan's-only record if I ever saw one.The music's ok, but sanitized. A very thorough scrubbing was done on these tracks to make sure that no stray feedback or echo gets into your ears. I hate that.If you're not a fan, find a best-of somewhere and stay away from this. Not too great.A Kinks Krapfest, unfortunately.I'd like to be wittier, but I can't. Sorry. It's just not that good."
4,An overlooked gem,"The Kinks 1980s ""comeback"" album was ""State of Confusion."" But in the late 1970s, the band released a quiet gem that might actually be better than that album. Ray Davies delivers his strongest set of songs since the early 1970s. The song ""Rock'n'Roll Fantasy"" is dedicated to devout fans (which was about all the band had during this time), while other songs like ""Misfits,"" and ""A Foreign Land"" cover typical Davies territory. Inclusion of the ace holiday track ""Father Christmas"" on the CD is great bonus. Overall, this is the best Kink album of the late 1970s."
4,God save the Kinks!,"A solid record that is not as quirky as their masterpieces but much better than its predecessor Sleepwalker. This is remastered with booklet and three bonus remixes and ""Father Christmas"". Of course it also has two of the better hits from the `70s...the title song & Rock N Roll Fantasy. Plus Ray must love wearing garters because there is another cross-dressing song in ""Out Of The Wardrobe"". God save the Kinks!"
5,:W U M P S C U T:,"The best album i own, and hopefully the best album you will soon own. Get this and everything else Rudy creates. He is truly a musical genius."
2,Extremely disappointing,"I'm a big fan of :wumpscut: in general, but this is probably Rudy's worst album. None of my friends who are into :wumpscut: like this album either, so I don't know what all the hoopla is about here. Definitely buy (nearly) everything else by :wumpscut:, but don't bother with ""Embryodead."""
5,A perfectly good resort for music,"For those of you being recomended for this CD or for those of your just getting into the music of Wumpscut, it's a winner. It seems to cover every base touchable through Dark Wave. It's complex diversity is a sure thing from the moment you pop the CD in, to the moment the last song ends. I would recomend this to any fan of Industrial. EmbryoDead is one of the two good cds to start off with. Many fans say it's the best album ever created, and I even agree in cases. If you find morbid interests in bad taste, then you can obviously tell from the title of this CD, the band is not for you altogether."
4,"Enjoyable, plausible, interesting intro to academic life","When I read a mystery novel, I hope for: 1. Clever plot, good writing, and an enjoyable waste of time. 2. To learn about a place or time I don't know much about. 3. Interesting characters, a bit of real literatureI bought this book to read on an airplane, and it kept me enjoyed. I already know about life in a Pharmacology dept., so I didn't learn anything new. But I think someone who doesn't know much about academic life would enjoy learning about Pharmacology (and wouldn't be mislead). I didn't expect this book to be literature, but in fact the characters are well written and deep, way more than the average mystery novel.I look forward to reading the sequel."
4,Organic Chemistry of Drug Design is Murder,"This book has the intelligent taste of a good mystery novel with a good spanking of steamy romance. The book is more easily digested if a background knowledge of chemistry and biology, but it does not preclude those who haven't. A must read for any quick wits out there!"
3,A highly adventurous book,"In Pharmacology is Murder, Dirk Wyle is able to wind a story about a murder that takes place in Dade County Florida and goes unsolved for nearly a year. The book is an interesting blend of adventure and clinical humor intertwined in a murder mystery that takes the scientific genious of a middle aged employee of the medical examiner's office through a trial and error process, to solve. The story steps through a crazy trail of deceit and misconception that leads Ben Candidi through the perils of a doctoral program in pharmacology and a love affair with a sophmore medical school student. I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to suffer through some of the dry humor and is unphased by sexual innuendoes."
4,Good Jock,"WAX is a great underwear company, and this is certainly a solid jockstrap. They size a little small (I was actually on the below the low end of the small size and it fit perfectly) but it fulfills its role admirably. It's a great runners jock with the narrow waistband and straps."
1,Be Careful!,"Read the label before you take this! I took two of these and had a horrible reaction, my skin turned bright red and started burning! I went to the hospital and eventually found out it was just an overdose of the B3. I had read an article that said a high dose B3 suppliment could help concentration associated with ADD."
4,Om ring,very nice ring exaclty what i wanted!wish it came in a size 14 then it would have been perfect
3,It is just a controller.,"no sixaxis. no rumble.this is a controller which has a home button.that is all.a controller must be precise and accurate. yes, it is.HOWEVER, PS3 controller should, repeat *SHOULD*, have sixaxis and rumble !!!also, this requires two AA batteries. (I tend to use rechargeable built-in battery.so, akward.)I can't believe this is manufactured by Logitech.. they never made me disappointed, but this time, yes they did.just one pro is .. i can use this one with my laptop. that's all."
4,Sweet Buy!,"I got the controller as a quick and more cost effective way to start playing my PS3! The other Logitech controllers I had to my Xbox and PS2 worked awesome. To my surprise the controller worked brilliantly! Don't get me wrong the Sony Sixaxis is prime, but also very expensive.The only drawback that comes to mind is the buttons are a some what taller than the Sony controllers! And this makes a slight difference when playing fighting games that require button mashing, such asTekken 6!In all I would definately recommend this controller to anyone who enjoys games and really doesn't want to pay an extreme amount for controllers!"
3,"ok controller, but you get what you pay for","this controller is ok for the price.but not as good as a Sony one.the directional pad isn't very good(when playing football games the players kind of zig-zag)and how you have to have double a batteries,but thats ok.."
3,expected more from logitech,"I owned the logitech precision controller for the ps2 due to the better fit in my hand compared to the smaller sony ps3 controller and I wanted to get the same for the ps3. When I received the controller the product felt and looked the same as the previous model. How well it worked was a different story. First of all, no tilt control (which I knew when I bought the controller) however I expected the rumble to work. I tried the controller with resident evil 5 and resistance on my ps3 and rumble didn't work. I went online and read reviews saying the controller didn't work with all games that had rumble because of the firmware updates. My controller also sounded like something was loose inside and this may be limited to my experience.Its an alright controller, but don't expect rumble to work properlyLike some online reviews are saying ""No rumble, No tilt, No problem"""
2,USB Receiver and AA Batteries? FAIL!,"The controller is pretty nice: a little larger than the real PS3 controller and the feel is pretty good, but USB receiver and AA batteries makes this controller a waste of money. Over the lifetime of the controller, you'll probably spend over $30 in batteries, not to mention the possibility of losing or breaking the receiver. Stick with the real Sony controller; although it's about $20 more, it's a better deal in the long run."
4,For those who have a PS3 with backwards compatibility,"Responds much better than a sixaxis or dualshock3 controller for ps1/ps2 games, though you should stick with a dualshock3/sixaxis for ps3 games. It can also be placed down without accidentally pressing a trigger button by accident due to trigger guards."
2,I expected better from Logitech!,"Being an owner of the Logitech Playstation 2 Wireless Controller, I expected the new Logitech Playstation 3 Cordless Precision Controller, but it failed to meet the same standards. It stop working properly after about three weeks. I used it mostly for COD: Modern Warfare 2 and found that pressing the R3 toggle a while to respond. The R2 and L2 buttons are extremely sensitive, insofar as a tiny brush of the finger can set them off. Use the money and buy yourself something better. Trying going for the Datel Rapid Fire PS3 remote controller. Well worth the money."
1,Could have been great,"I really enjoyed this controller - while it worked. None of the buttons became stuck; instead the L2 button failed internally. The controller thought the L2 button was being pressed constantly, thus ruining the controller. I couldn't play any games because of it. I liked the controller until then, but I'll definitely be getting the PS3 controller when I return this one."
1,Awful,"You press a button. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it takes a second to respond. Sometimes it doesn't respond at all. Tried it at 15 feet. Tried it a few inches from the receiver. It doesn't matter. I'm having a hard time telling whether this is just a poorly designed controller or if my controller was just damaged/defective. Really, really awful."
1,Expect more from Logitech,"I bought this mostly on the Logitech name. The usb dongle is junk but the controller is decent. Whenever I try to remove the dongle, the cover comes off and exposes the board inside. The controller is comfortable and responsive and maybe I got a bad dongle. Not sure I can recommend or will purchase another one any time soon."
1,WORTHLESS NO SOFTWARE UPDATES,This controllers looks and feels better than any other but there is no updates from logitech.. this controller does not work on most of the new games out... it does not work on killzone 3..... logitech leaves it up to the producer of the game to make sure the controller works.... they pretty much take ur money and blame it on others that it doesnt work.... worthless... it is truly a piece of crap.... feed the pig of some other company... give 15 more bucks to sony and get a controller that will work for at least a year or two.... DO NOT BUY THIS CONTROLLER unless u just want it for a paperweight.... that is all it is good for......
1,Awful. Controlls were all messed up,I bought this controller because it was a cheaper alternative to the more expensive[...]one. However you get what you pay for.....I didn't like the shape of the controller.... but i figured i could get used that. Then when I went downstairs to play with it the controls were different then what they were suppose to be which made for awful game play....[...]
4,Better Performance.,"this is an outstanding controller! I think that it is way better than the controllers that come with the Ps3. If you don't believe me, I'll tell you this: there is more control on the analog stocks meaning that they don't stick at all. Plus the controller is more efficient because it can last days on just 2 AA batteries whereas the controller that comes with the Ps3 can only last a few hours. Anyway, Logitech (the name of the company) makes one of the best hardware around. If I wanted a fourth controller, this would be my first choice for its durability and efficiency."
5,Intimacy and Honesty from a Genius,"I purchased this CD several years ago when it first came out and play it regularly. It feels like Breau is in the room with you. I have never felt such emotion from a jazz recording, it gives me goose bumps with every listening. Also excellent is his Live on Bourban Street disc. I look forward to getting the Living Room Tapes CD in the near future. I don't have much to add to what others have said about Breau's stunning mastery of his instrument. I have been hooked on him since I heard his version of ""Mercy Mercy Mercy"" on a Guitar Player magazine jazz collection years ago (the cut is on the Velvet Touch cd). I am also a huge fan of the late Joe Pass, whom I was fortunate to see perform late in his career in a small basement club in Annapolis, but there is a shimmering ethereal quality in Lenny's playing that moves me in ways that no other musician does. If you love guitar music, buy this disc."
5,Especially recommended for academic Art History collections,"The Spitz Master: A Parisian Book Of Hours examines a classic work of literary art, created in Paris around 1420 by a team of illuminators including one inventive soul now called ""The Spitz Master"". Art history professor and scholar Gregory T. Clark informatively introduces and provides a ""reader friendly"" examination of the history and significance of this work, while black-and-white as well as color photographs showcase pages drawn from the classic work in all their individual and collective glory. The Spitz Master is especially recommended for academic Art History collections."
4,A good introduction to Inuit lore,"This book is a rather quick read, but a very good one. These contain stories, legends, myths and fables of the Eskimos. This is a good read, and a very enjoyable read. Anyone with an interest in Eskimo myth, or anyone with an interest in fables and myths will enjoy this read."
5,Fantastic Reading!,"Daisy and Dan are twins who live near the High Forest. When they go walking in the woods one day, they meet some very strange people. These people turn out to be trees! As the two become friendly with the trees, they learn about the traditions from when there was more respect for the forest. Through each season they come to understand who is really a danger to whom, and become wrapped in the secret world of the tree kingdom. The story is enthralling and well written. You will never look at trees in quite the same way again."
2,Not really noticing a difference,I purchased because I heard it helps with mild anxiety issues. Two weeks later and no noticeable difference or benefits.
1,Did nothing for either of us,No response using the recommended dosage for two adults. Guess we'll stick with 6mg melatonin and a Benadryl or two.
1,Oh my dear god.................,"What restless, nightmarish ""sleep"" I had! I have tried one other Passion Flower product, and same result. All the research I could find was pro Passion Flower, however, the same botanist that discovered Hoodia, found that Passion Flower and Valerian Root could cause bad nightmares in a small percentage of people. I'm sure this reaction is not typical as millions of people use these herbs everyday. Further digging did list both herbs as active ingredients in the new ""herbal smoke"" or ""incense"" that have been popping up lately to give people a legal high. In fairness, any drug whether it be from big pharma or natural such as Melatonin, creates an unpleasent night of sleep for me. Exhaustion seems to be the only cure. If asked to rate the apparent level of quality this manufacturer produces the pills, I would rate 5 stars. This seems like a solid company."
3,worked at first,Seemed to work in the beginning. I took it before I went to bed and it started to cause acid reflux in the latter days of use. Doesn't work the same anymore.
3,calms me!,"This does what it is supposed to and calms my stress and anxiety. However, it calms me a little too much and makes me very sleepy. So I woud not recomend taking it in the early parts of the day. But evening time it works like a charm. :)"
3,ITS OK,NOT THE BEST PASSION FLOWER. DOESNT LAST LONG. BUT ITS OK IF UR LOOKING FOR A 10MINUTE RELIEF FEELING. BUT CAME FAST
5,Wonderful - Thank you!,I have been using the passion flower capsules for two weeks and I really love the results. Thank you! I trust your quality when buying any supplements.
2,Does nothing,Those finding this helpful may be getting the placebo effect. It didn't produce any noticable effect in me even with a few weeks of use.
4,For mild anxiety/stress relief,I should start by saying I have a very high tolerance to drugs in general so herbs don't always work for me. I took 3 about 2 hours before laying down and it seemed to have a calming/relaxing effect. Definitely try it out if you are tired of OTC drugs or prescription meds to calm you down.
5,Passion Flower really helped me.,"I had taken Zoloft for 3 years and didnt want to become dependent on the medication as being a medical professional, the side effects are worse than actually taking the medication for anxiety/depression. I have been on Passion Flower approximately 1 week and my husband stated he has noticed a very massive improvement. I had been aloof and reclusive and have actually ventured out and havent had a anxiety issue. I also see a chiropractor for myofasical pain and it has a muscle relaxant quality. For me, it has worked. And my back pain has been cut in half. Even my adjustments have been easier as my muscles are relaxed and everything slides right into place. So I hope this product continues to work as I would like to function again."
1,design flaw that could cost you your phone,"Seek out a OEM Motorola holster if you want one that really holds your phone securely. These imitations have a design flaw that allows your phone to fall from the holster unintentionally. On these knockoffs,the small notch that snaps into the slot on top of your phone is not long enough to snap in securely. Even the way it sounds when it snaps in tells you it is not secure. The slightest bump or the routine jostling your phone takes while you are sitting or riding in a car can release the phone. Next thing you know, phone gone. The OEM holster does NOT swivel and has the Motorola logo embossed on the clip on back. When you snap our phone into it, it is IN until YOU decide to release it. I wish the OEM ones swiveled but I can live without that."
2,NOT OEM,Discription said OEM but turned out to be a cheap non-OEM product. Fell apart about a week after I got it.
2,Very cheap,I bought one of these and loved it until it fell to the ground and the top piece split off. My old phone had a holster and it was used daily for 2 years...dropped it many times...no problem.'This one snapped within a month of use.
4,The Land of Mexico in a Nutshell,"I have read many of Michcner's books and found many style similarities with this one as well. Unlike Chesapeake, and Centennial, and Texas, and others, we spend more time in the present (1960s) looking at the current events surrounding the three-day Festival of Flowers and its bull fights, and a bit less looking at the historical pathways leading up to it. My favorite aspect of Michener books is the historical parts which is why I only gave this book 4 of 5 stars. The characters are definitely multi-dimensional, however, and Michener ties in all timelines of the novel well. I was left with a much greater insight into the psyche of the Mexican people. An overall excellent read."
3,Glad this one is behind me,"I've read many other Micheners, but this one took an abnormally long time for me to finish. I just couldn't get into this one.Like other reviewers, I found the seemingly endless descriptions of buillfighting a bit tedious: I don't know if bullfighting is truly THAT important in Mexico, but I was willing to let Michener decide upon what he wanted to write.After reading other Michener books, I was comfortable with what I expected pre-read: a decent overview of the history of Mexico told through the lens of a few families. Well, we got that (a little), maybe I just wanted more of a fix. If you're like me, ""Mexico"" will leave you jones-ing for more.While it's not a bad book, by any means, there are plenty of other books to read before this one."
2,Skip This One,"I almost always thoroughly enjoy Michener's works - but this one transcended tedium. As opposed to a history of Mexico - this book shines a huge spotlight on the sport of bullfighting. If you enjoy bullfighting and want to know a little bit about Mexican history - by all means, this is the book for you. If you're looking for a compelling work of historical fiction on Mexico (such as we're accustomed to from Mr. Michener) - do yourself a huge favor and pick up a copy of 'Aztec' by Gary Jennings."
2,A great novel ruined by ridiculous characters,"Like most of his books, Mexico is very well-researched and full of historical information and factoids that make for the most interesting parts of the novel. Also, like most of his novels, Mexico is full of ridiculously heroic characters that drag the book down into Michener purgatory. The story goes from fascinating glimpses into Aztec culture and rituals to stories of bullfighters who, while eating dinner, `wield a fork in the graceful manner that only a matador could'. It's during these sections that you ask yourself why you're wasting your time reading this, but usually the historical stories of the land and cultures reach you just in time to grab your interest and force you to continue reading, albeit at times rather regrettably."
2,Hope you like bullfighting,"I have read many Michener novels, and enjoyed almost all of them. 'Mexico', however, is terrible.If you set out to read this slow-moving behemoth, then you'd better *really* like bullfighting. There are just so many long and boring sections on the topic. It was such a struggle to get through it all.The early parts on Aztec culture were fine, but after that I almost needed to tape my eyelids open. Talk about dull and dry. I couldn't wait for it to finish.If you are tempted to read this book, slap yourself a few times and go and get 'Alaska' or 'Chesapeake' instead. Please."
3,Mexico,James Michener does an excellent job in researching the area he is writing about. I love the way he weaves a story around chronological events and continues with descendants of the characters he begins with. He certainly opened my eyes to a Mexico I had never known before. He does an excellent job of relating bullfighting to those who know nothing about it.
2,There's a reason you can buy this one used for 1 cent,"I'm a diehard Michener fan, but this book was a pitiful effort and unworthy to sit on the shelf alongside his other books . If anybody except JM had written this book, it would never have made it to publication. It's a gazillion pages about a bullfight. Like a couple of other reviewers, I did learn a tiny bit about the politics of Mexico. The Source, JM's book about the so-called Holy Land, was like taking a graduate level course in comparative religion. Mexico was one great big yawn."
4,"James Michener, good as always","Fun, entertaining, typical James Michener. He writes like he has lived there all his life. Has done his research well."
3,Telefono?,"I like Mitchener. I love Mexico and I love bullfighting. I've even written novels on the Conquest of Mexico...so why didn't I like this book?I don't even know but it didn't hold my attention and his rivalry between the ""classic"" matador and the bullfighting hotdog was laughable. To be certain, I hate it when the matador [killer] demeans the bull by taking liberties with the supposedly subdued animal. Tricks like touching the animals horn or kissing it on the nose are only to be deplored. A ""telephono"" stunt would cause most of the aficianados to lynch the [...].I found the early Mexican period unconvining...I just didn't buy it. This is, perhaps, surprising in that Michener, himself, regarded ""Mexico"" as his best book. Maybe it was but I don't see it that way.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God"" on the Conquest of Mexico"
5,nice read,"While this book is not for everyone, it is for people who have an interest in learning about the history of a great nation. From the Mayan and Aztec battles to the Spanish insurrection, to the war with America the author takes you on a ride. This book is not about bullfighting it is about the clash of cultures, people, and history that formed a nation. This is a great read and is highly recommended."
4,Lots of Bullfighting Some Mexican History,"This book was certainly different than most Michener historical fiction books. For one thing it's a tiny bit shorter which is a welcome relief. Secondly there was more stuff on bullfighting than there was on the history. I really wasn't that interested to begin with, but found that I did get more interested as time went on. The story was a good one, but I like to see more history and that's why I've read each of his historical fiction books. This is my last book in his list and it was a fun one."
4,Viva Mexico,"I have always wanted to visit Mexico. Haveing lived in California for a while I developed a great admiration of the Mexican culture. The story is of a writter; what could be easier for an author than having his main character be a writter. As always Michener is complete at starting his epic from the beginning (a trademark I love) and bringing you up to modern times. The stories of the native indians and old Spain provide a great backgound. What I felt was the most compelling though was his providing some American characters (tourists) to view his modern day Mexico. They provide a way for him to view some of our stereotypes and misconceptions of Mexican culture. What would Mexico be without Bullfighting, a very captavating and exciting sport, despite the fact that I have never seen one in person."
4,"Good, not great.....","If this wasn't Michener, I may have given it 3 stars.....The story was great, a little long and there were parts that should have been left out, but very interesting.....I learned a lot about mexican history, bullfighting and the relationship between mexico and the u.s."
2,I use to...,only use this temporary hair color. It's ok if you don't want to use permanent hair coloring. I have sense evolved and I am now using Bigen.
5,Great Resource.,"For educators or people interested in how the Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church is elected, this is an excellent resource. Easy to read, with charts to inform what happens in the Church from the day the Pope dies until a successor is chosen. Also includes some of the ""major players"" and what is the criteria that will be used in choosing the next pontiff. Afterword includes the ""Apostolic Constitution"" written by Pope John Paul II."
2,"Better than his novel, but...","I finally read this over the past few days and I must confess I'm getting more information out of watching CNN and the networks. Not recommended as your primary source, or secondary actually. But if you have to have every book on this subject, feel free to snap it up."
2,more history and more details needed!,"The book is very sketchy with respect to details and the important history of the Catholic church and the middle ages. The author spends little ink on the history of the papacy during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. The ""selection"" of the pope during those tumultuous years was indeed a very different process compared to the section during the 19th and 20th centuries! The authior seems to concentrate and details the process during these later centuries and seems to gloss over the middle ages when the Catholic Church ruled not only the Vatican, but also the Governments of virtually all Europe. For a more accurate and detailed account of how the popes were ""selected"" during the middle ages (3 centuries), I would recommend Wm Manchester's history of the middle ages ""A World Lit By Only Fire"". This is an unbias account of the papacy during the middle ages and how it shaped the future of the Catholic Religion."
1,I tried.......,"I tried to finish this book. I almost never put a book away unfinished. I can almost always find some reason to complete what I started, but this time I just couldn't. I couldn't relate to the characters, the plot was silly and the whole thing was boring. What else can I say? I didn't like it."
2,Could have done much better,"The sandals, while they will work just fine, are of very low quality. Cheap fabric bottom, and the straps are felt with ribbon on one side. You can probably save a lot of money and get a better result by making this at home. Find cheap brown sandals somewhere, make your own straps with whatever fabric you want, and use either hot glue or superglue. I could see that potentially working better if anyone has any experience with do-it-yourself activity."
4,Roman sandals - not for larger feet,"Being a size 11.5, these sandals were almost too small for me. There were no size options when selecting the product. My toes or my heel hung over the sandal when I wore them. The picture depicted a foot bed of bamboo-style; however the product arrived with a brown cloth foot bed. Not a huge deal, but picture did not accurately represent the product. Tie up laces came loose a number of times and had to be redone. Satisfied with the quick delivery for Halloween and product over all."
5,An Ignored History Brought To Life,"They Cleared The Lane: The NBA's Black Pioneers by Ron Thomas, is an informative and entertaining account of the early Black players and coaches of the NBA.It is obvious Mr. Thomas has done extensive research through interviews, and media archives to examine and clarify the enormous social and athletic impact of the early Black NBA players. As a true basketball fanatic, I enjoyed the opportunity to read and learn about some important individuals who help to shape and define the NBA."
5,"Anecdotes, engaging stories, and little-known facts","They Cleared The Lane by professional sportswriter Ron Thomas is the amazing story of the people who dared to break the color line in professional basketball. Once, racism dominated this sport in America, but the efforts of the first professional black players and coaches changed all that. Filled with anecdotes, engaging stories, and little-known facts, They Cleared The Lane is informative reading that will appeal to all basketball enthusiasts who want to learn more about the history of this beloved sport. They Cleared The Lane is also highly recommended for Black Studies supplemental reading lists and reference collections."
1,These could kill your dog!,"I bought these for our dogs because the package says they are natural and healthful. The package does NOT mention that they can kill dogs by causing intestinal blockage, vomiting, and horrible diarrhea. Maybe if you supervise your dog while it eats a Nubz and make sure that your dog chews it THOROUGHLY, you might not have a problem. I bought these treats two days ago and ALL FOUR OF OUR DOGS ARE VOMITING AND/OR HAVE TERRIBLE DIARRHEA! If you buy this product, you should monitor your dogs closely. We have taken one of our dogs to the 24-hour Emergency Clinic and the others are on a bland diet to help their symptoms."
3,A bit of a disappointment.,"This book is primarily a history of the fighting knife and descriptions of the author's preferences in field knives. There isn't much material on actual knife-fighting techniques. The author usually refers the reader to previous works by people such as Fairbairn, Styers and Applegate. There was very little consideration of the Asian knife-fighting styles which surprised me a bit, as I know David Steele is trained in several Asian styles including Escrima. I think this book is made up of Steele's previous magazine articles as it is a little disjointed. It's a good reference book and well worth the money, but I wouldn't recommend it as a how-to or as a first knife-fighting manual. The history related is excellent with some good war stories from folks who had occasion to use the knife in combat."
1,Typical General Garbage,"I bought these to do computer repairs, hardly a heavy duty environment. The first time I used the T7 driver to removes a slightly tight screw the driver bent and broke in half. The metal shaft only extends 1"" into the handle, and the break point was where the shaft ends. Cheap plastic construction. I paid almost $20 for this set, and at $4 per driver they are a major waste of money. Buyer beware!"
3,teen tv show actors try their hands at music,"this cd is a must for those of you who liked goerge michaelwhen he was making pop music. it sounds like a late 90's versionof wham with some marky mark hip-hop raps mixed in. when i sayrap i don't mean groups from compton rapping about smacking ho's,smoking chronic, drinking 40's, peeling caps & swearing so muchthat you have to bleep out every other word just to get radio play. these are two white kids from england. they did a remakeof the monkees hit ""steping stone"" that could give ""i'm a believer"" by smashmouth a run for it's money.if you are an erasure fan like me, you'll be interested toknow that andy bell sings backup vocals on a track called shout,but don't buy the cd just for that.this disc is very uptempo with some wham-esque ballads. ifyou like english pop & are tired of playing old wham records, try ant & dec."
4,Enjoyable collection - but a story's missing,"This is a pleasing (in more ways than one) collection of holiday-themed stories: some sweet-and-hot, some just hot; some touching, some *about* touching... And yes, the Santa-Daddy on the cover is very, um, well, ""nice and naughty,"" I guess. There's one glitch, though; the book lists Felice Picano among the authors, but his story ""Xmas in the Apple"" isn't in the book. Not in my copy, anyway. The table of contents lists it, but the page numbers for it and subsequent stories are a bit messed up, so it looks as if the story was dropped at the last minute? It's a lovely little bedside (or fireside) book anyway, but if you wanted it for the sake of the Picano story, you're out of luck!"
5,A serious book worth reading,"Dr. Tavris has based this book on serious research on the subject of anger. She debunks many of the pop myths about the purpose of anger and helps the reader to understand the causes of expressed anger. Her central point is that anger is a self-reinforcing mechanism that does not have healthy outcomes in itself. She explains the physiological purpose and effects of anger, pointing out that we really don't need to be angry in our lives.Instead she suggests various models and techniques to help understand what ""sets us off"" and how to manage anger. A number of situations are covered and illustrated by personal and clinical examples.This is not a prescription for a quick fix for quick tempers - while Dr. Tavris is sympathetic about the many reasons why we get angry, she avoids simplistic behavioral techniques as well as overly introspective ones"
4,Enjoyable for all ages and intellectual levels!,"Carol Tavris' book is direct, funny, and involves the reader in a way that makes it accessible by anyone, even a university student who was merely curious about whether she would be considered an angry person. Tavris was straightforward, comprehensive, and clearly taught that recognizing others' and your own perceptions is the key to problem solving situations. She also taught that problem solving is the best solution to anger, though in certain situations, anger is a solution."
3,Delorme Street ATlas USA 2007,"I am not as satisfied with this as I should be. I installed it on my desktop which runs windows xp, and I had to change some registry items in order to get it to run. I also have a new laptop with the new windows vista system, and it will not install on my new laptop. I was thinking perhpas I should exchange it for one that would work with the vista system, but I think the cost is too high for the newer version for the vista system."
1,Look Elsewhere for both PC and PPC,"I bought this primarily for the included Pocket PC version to use with a Bluetooth GPS with my Cingular 8125 phone. Man, what a disappointment.As others have mentioned, the interface on the PC version is completely unintuitive. Making a mistake is easy, and fixing it is difficult.The handheld version included in the package is almost useless. It is slow, cumbersome, inaccurate, and inefficient.If you're looking for software to make your PocketPC device act like a dedicated GPS device, I suggest looking at the TomTom software or iNav's iGuidance (which also includes versions for PC and UMPC).If you're looking for software on the PC, at a comparable price, I've found Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007 to be far superior than Delorme's product. The interface is much more intuitive, less cluttered, and more informative than Delorme's.You'll save yourself a lot of time and frustration by avoiding this piece of software."
2,Street Atlas USA 2007,"The Street Atlas USA 2007 (SA2007) user interface is proprietary to DeLorme and not intuitive to Windows users. I also have Street Atlas 7 (SA7) and, even though it is also proprietary, I find it easier to use.The streets in SA2007 are from the same old database used in Garmin's 1999 Road & Rec MapSource CD. In some areas, including Lake Tahoe, streets are significantly inaccurate. This was discovered by uploading GPS tracks to a PC and observing how well they matched roads on various maps. On newer maps excluding SA2007 the match was near perfect. On SA2007 and Garmin Roads & Rec the error was up to 350 ft.I have several DeLorme products and must say I am disappointed with SA2007. I have uninstalled it from my PC and gone back to SA7."
1,Won't Install (XP),"Five attempts at install on an XP Home box have ended in failure: various snags have occurred during failure, from the infamous error 1720, to issues with my palm integration. Each error occurs only AFTER a long load of the three install discs, and an entire rollback is performed involuntarily. I've attempted to correct the 1720 error based on Delorme's recommendations, but that hasn't worked either.Absolutely pathetic: why do we continue to encounter issues like this on home computers?"
4,I liked it,"The ""riot"" portion of the film lasted all but a minute or so, not much really and not really a riot by today's standards either. The film, in my belief, would be better described as a documentary about the rights of transsexuals in 1960's San Francisco. Low budget but definitely informative and contains a bevy of neat vintage footage of drag queens and transsexuals, both in video and photograph form. Since there is not a whole lot in the way of gay documentaries from that era, I think it is a must see for any homosexual person interested in gay civil rights from days past."
1,50 Piece Garbge,"I got this to pair with a metal pegboard also available on Amazon, and while this is listed as working for both 1/8th and 1/4 holes, it barely stayed in the 1/4s. When I went to bend the back of a 5 inch hook to get a more snug fit against the board, part of the piece snapped off with light pressure as if it had been soldered instead of welded. I wouldn't trust these to hold any sort of moderately heavy tool. What's worse, they are so cheap that the return shipping is almost as much as the hooks were originally. Still, I'd rather have my $2 back."
4,Good Quality but I prefer Stanley,"This is a good product and it works well. It's sturdy and I've put heavy tools such as a 5 pound sledge on the pegs. The pieces do fall out from time to time... especially the smaller ones. I recently bought the ""'Stanley Tools 819841 51 Piece Pegboard Hook Assortment"" because I have 2 peg boards and I feel like the Stanley is sturdier and a little nicer. Plus, it has little clips that keep the small pieces from falling out of the board... a nice bonus.Overall, I like this product. I just wouldn't buy it again since the Stanley set is better quality for a similar price."
2,They will work,"I received these as part of a gift that included the Wall Control steel pegboard. As other people have stated, these pegs are 1/8"" rather than 1/4"".While they will work, they are far from secure on the board. The pieces that have more than 1 hook are pretty stable, however the single hook pieces are loose and rotate from side to side.They will serve for now, but I will definitely be looking to replace them."
3,Peg board hook assortment,Would have preferred more straight hooks and fewer curved ones. But overall a good buy.
4,Pegboard Organizers,This included a variety of pegboard hooks that easily handled all the tools from my toolbox. Exactly what I wanted and needed.
5,Excellent and Durable Quality,"Despite the one negative review here, I decided to give these hooks a try anyway. I mean, the heaviest thing I'm going to be hanging from it is my Stanley FatMAX Hammer, the rest would be just screwdrivers and pliers and the like. I'm not sure what the other reviewer received that made him give this product only 1 star, but these hooks are extrememly durable. I cannot bend these hooks with my hands and it would even be a struggle trying to bend them with pliers. If you were to hang the heaviest item you could think of from these hooks, it would rip right through your pegboard before you could even put a hair of a bend into these hooks. Excellent quality and excellent price. Give them a try, you'll like them."
3,A Weak 3,"I give this product a weak ""3""the 50 piece Peg Board set I bought should have identified the pegs on the pieces as 1/8"" they are very flimsy and cheap looking every time I remove a tool from one of theese hangers, it is so loose it falls out onto my bench or floor and then I have the inconvienence of looking for it then putting it back to where I had it back on the 1/4"" (this is the standard size, nobody sells 1/8"")peg board. I just ask that you clarify this on your product and the buyer might be interested investing in some peg holders so the peg hangers stay put where you have placed them."
1,"Flimsy 1/8"" stuff","Caution: I got these as an add on when buying workbench legs. I had hoped they were the better 1/4 "" hardware, but they are the dimestore ""one size fits all"" pieces."
1,Don't waste your money,"These peg board attachments are as cheap as they get. The craftsmanship is terrible -- many of my pieces are completely crooked. The spot welds on the metal are junk. I tried to straighten one out a little, and the weld just broke apart. It's not just one or two of these things that are bad, it's all of them. If I had known this, I never would've bothered purchasing these things. Save yourself the trouble and either buy something nicer from Amazon or go to your local hardware store and inspect a different set for yourself. Avoid these at all costs!"
2,"Too thin to stay in place, no plastic/rubber tips to help","Make sure this is the exact product you can use on your pegboard. Like other reviewers said, it is 1/8' and does not come with the plastic/rubber tips that would lock them in the holes on the board.The pieces are strong enough, but it is very annoying when they fall off every time you pick a tool off the board."
1,cheap set better off buying ad big box stores,I purchased this and a 43 piece at Lowe's...Cons:This one has thin and springy metal that doesn't stay put and bends easily.It doesn't have black plastic pieces that lock it into place.Poor variety of pieces (mostly tiny hooks)... no bin no jar..etc.The cheap pieces also don't have protective plastic covers....The 43 piece set I bought at Lowe's actually had more useful pieces. Better metal and protective plastic over the tips of sharp metal hooks...Save yourself the hassle and buy a better set...
1,Mostly Junk,"Amazon recommended coupling this andStanley Tools 819841 51 Piece Pegboard Hook Assortment- so I did. Comparatively, this set is junk. Many hooks don't have sufficient angle to hold the tools without them slipping off. The six screwdriver holder is the only decent piece in the 50-piece box. Go with the Stanley set and skip this one."
1,Poor quality,Used these in myWall Control 30-P-3232B Black Metal Pegboard Packand the size of holders are way too small. The quality of the material used in this product is also poor. The screwdriver holder barely holds a standard set without them sliding all over the place. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
3,You get what...,"I usually use a heavier hook that screws in for my larger tools, and yes it does cost more, but the security it provides is well worth the price difference. So I got most of my larger tools taken care of, what am I left with? A bunch of holes that need filling. So now I don't need the top of the line, 1-2 steps down is just fine. And that is what this product is. Just fine for hanging flash lights, screwdrivers, all the little crap that needs to be put somewhere. Yes it does sometimes pull away from the board, so what! Use some hold-downs or cable-ties. Most of the people I know spend more time bitching and moaning about a problem then it takes to fix it. If you have so many tools that you have to hang them up, dealing with a small problem like this is no big deal!"
5,"Reasonable, good selection of peg board holders.",Very good price for the amount and variety received.
2,Should have spent a little more,"Well I received my ""49"" piece set...They are very cheap and I could not use 3 of them because the back pieces have broken off.Each piece is unique - not a lot of consistency or quality. I also am annoyed that they are all bent so horizontally that tools just slide off.Would not buy again."
2,Cheap,They are cheaply made and are somewhat unstable in my metal pegboard. Cheap tack welds and improperly aligned pieces. I would suggest getting a higher rated set.
5,EVER WONDERED HOW TO TRAVEL?,"first of all, cees nooteboom is a shining oasis in the arid intellectual desert of contemporary travel writing, and secondly, you should let go of everything that makes you unhappy, and set sail tomorrow.the sheer profundity and wit of nooteboom's observations left me, for one, in like total dumbstruck awe, and his seemingly divine ability to translate the most visceral of emotions into words (a medium of communication i had always, up till now, considered inferior) made me feel a little bit the same way i felt the first time i went skydiving. folks, this here is a man who knows how to travel, as well as being a freakin miracle of a writer--and anyone who is capable of firing a sincere philosophic-type synapse will LOVE HIM. also read ""the following story,"" all you existential types out there--he's like a dreamy, colorful Camus, and his prose will make your eyes feel clean for the first time in years."
3,Disappointed in this book.,"Am still trying to finish this book! Compared to some of the others on the subject, it's a hard read. I'll probably sell it."
