4,Acoustic Research AW-871 wireless indoor speakers,"After I first connectected them to TV, they did not work. I got pretty upset. When tried again next day, they have started to work. Volume control make some noise when changing volumes. Otherwise sound quality is OK. Used them only with power cords, think that battery would be gone quite fast."
5,Excellent value,I bought these speakers to place on the second level of my house - so that I wouldn't have run wires. They worked flawlessly and setting them up was very easy - almost plug and play. I opted to purchase NiMh batteries for one of speakers - they were expensive. I would highly recommend these speakers for general use.
1,Scratchy Interference is what you get,"I've had these speakers for a while now, and I tried, really tried to get them to stop picking up interference. Even when the transmitter is a few inches away, they'd still squawk and spatter, ruining the music. No way to attenuate their receive sensitivity. So, into the trash they will go, so much for that folly outlay of cash."
1,Useless for Surround Sound,Only work by plugging into an RCA connector or through a headphone jack. Useless if you have an expensive receiver that does not have the RCA jack option. Sounds was average at best. Shipped them back 1/2 hr after I opened the package.
1,Worst buy ever!!,"These speakers worked great for about a month and then all of a sudden they lost signal and stopped working altogether. Tried to contact the company, they siad there was must be to much interference in my home, this was causing them not to work."
4,Working nicely,"Overall, I would say these speakers are a very good deal. The sound quality is not fantastic but is very good (I am picky that way, sorry). Think about it, very good wireless sound for just over $100. You really can't beat it.I had no trouble with setup. Mine were plug-n-play, there was no ""setup"". They worked all over my house, outside and no interference. I put my cordless phone near all components and I also have a Max Range WiFi right next to the transmitter with no problem.I am able to hook these to my computer (or MP3, stereo), load 5+ hours of music for uninterrupted listening in my garage or while I am refinishing my kitchen. No more changing CDs while I work!The only thing I would like to see on these is a remote control for the volume and/or a way to change volume with one knob and not try to balance the sound on both speakers. Putting a litle dot of paint on the knobs solves this problem.No regrets, great system!"
3,"Easy to set up, okay sound",I found that the speakers were easy to set up. The sound quality is okay but not great. A downside is that the speakers stay on all the time and draw power unless you go from speaker to speaker and turn them off.
3,annoying lights!,"overall, ok sound, but signal comes in and out. furthermore, there is a bright light (blue or red)on the speaker which apparently is there to tell you whether the signal is coming through. this adds no additional information, unless you are deaf, and presumably there are few deaf buyers of this product. the light is very bright and can not be deactivated. the speaker in my bedroom must be unplugged at night or tipped over in order to eliminate the annoying light and then replugged in in the daytime."
4,"Excellent, but with one flaw","The speakers are excellent and an excellent value in all repects but one. The one flaw is that you cannot turn them off. They are on all the time when not in use, cunsuming energy and emitting a humming noise. When you discoonect them from the wall outlet they start howling. When you push the voloume button the blue light goes off for about 30 seconds than comes on again and the humming noise resumes."
2,Not good with Batteries,"We bought the AW871 speakers and did not see the warning that you cannot have the speaker pluggged in WITH batteries. The batteries expoded and leaked all over. The speaker is ruined. I, along with other customers, did not see this small warning in the instructions. We were using our speakers inside the house (plugged in) and then wanted to use them for outside use (with batteries). Who wants to take time to use a screwdriver everytime we bring them back into the house? Frustrating! Although the product does work fine if using with an outlet. But one of the reasons we did buy the product was for the battery use."
5,"These speakers work great, just as promised.","I've had these speakers for over a month now, and they're working great. The range at which I'm using them is only about 5-7 feet (from a computer under a hutch to a desk out in the middle of the room--I didn't want wires running along the floor), but the sound quality is superb and there's only very rare interference. I have each speaker plugged into AC power, so I can't comment on the battery life/rechargable option. All and all, I've been very pleased with these speakers: they look great, the sound quality has been excellent, they are, indeed, wireless, and the setup was simple."
1,Not worth the hassle,"These speakers should be as easy as plug and play, but they are not. They are tempermental to position to other electronic systems. And, the feedback displays on the wireless transmitter does not make it any easier. Basically, the instructions say if the light is blinking, but not more than half the time, it is okay. If they light does not go on or it blinks too much, then you get no sound. Running speakers wires thru walls are easier than these things."
1,AW871 Delivered but incomplete,Speakers were delivered and one woiuld not turn on. Poor quality control.
2,For what its worth,"My buddy, who used to manage a Cambridge Soundworks, would call this a boomerang product since it and others like it were so often purchased then returned. However, I think it is worth the price I paid. I was concerned that it operates at 900 megahertz...same as my cordless phone but, so far, no problems there. Just be careful that there is a fairly direct line of sight from transmitter to speakers as the signal does not do corners or walls all that well. Sound quality is OK"
1,fine at first but . .,"At the end of a few months, one speaker stopped working entirely and the other has developed a loud hissing background noise. I'm sure our stone house doesn't help matters, but I am disappointed that they seem to have dwindling usefulness over such a short period."
4,Good Speakers,"I've had these speakers for a month now and am quite happy with them. The distance works all over my apartment, as well the sound quality is good. I typically have been using them to pipe music from my tivo or radio to other rooms and it works well for this.When I first had them it would take a mintue or so for the speakers to find the transmitters signal, however now they work just fine, finding the signal almost immediately.Additionally they would get a little noise whenever I walked between a speaker and the transmitter however by pushing the power button quickly the speaker will reacquire the signal and this seems to help; it also address any popping issues I've had.One down side is that each speaker takes 8 C batteries, which aren't a cheap purchase on their own. However they serve as battery chargers too so the batteries aren't just wasted.Another is that the speaker volume's can't be synchronized, so I imagine hooking them up to a receiver would be annoying for surround sound."
2,Not recommended,"I purchased these speakers to pipe music by the pool. One speaker works really well and the other always loses signal and pipes out a loud squealing noise. It's not the distance, we have put one speaker close to the transmitter and no change.Not much on the market for wireless speakers, maybe because the technology just isn't there!"
4,AR 871 Good for the money,"Set these up as remote speakers for a church using 2 pair and one transmitter tied off their PA. Worked surprisinly well. I placed 2 units in the Foyer area at different positions, one in a nursery and one in a toddler room. The main Sanctuary was seperate from the rest of the building by a floor to ceiling firewall making most RFI transmissions difficult. Even the toddler room speaker (125' away) worked. I had to adjust for the best frequency, using #2, and all the static even from the furthest one went away. Sound quality is quite good for the speakers' size, and volume was sufficient for my application. High end audiophiles probably will not appreciate these, but anytime you can have sound without wires is a pleasent experience. Do read and understand the manual as you do have to press and hold the volume button down to power up and off the speakers."
5,great sound for game room,"speakers work great, we have them in the next room about 50 feet from the transmitter. Have used them outside, very easy to move around. the sound is very clear, we were surprised with the quality."
1,Nope,"These speakers were unacceptable. In fact, I returned them, and I don't often return things. They never got a good reception, always hissing and fading in and out. I finally put them within 5 feet of the receiver, and they still had this intermittent popping sound; very annoying. I got a full refund and remain satisfied with service in general from Amazon."
5,Satisfied with product,"I have been very pleased with my AR-871 speakers. The set-up was easy, and the sound is good for wireless speakers (I'm a classical music fan). The blue light mentioned in other reviews is indeed bright, but I'll probably just put some electrical tape over it (or most of it) if this continues to bother me. I regret the technology for wireless speakers is such that the volume can't be controlled from the main amp rather than the speaker itself, but probably that capability will be available sometime later. I am a contented customer and would definitely recommend this purchase. The quality and the price make a good combination for people who want high quality sound but don't need to have the sound be perfect."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This product arrived non-fuctional out of the box. I had to pay for shipping to get it replaced. The new ones worked for two weeks, and then stopped working again. They once again, if I bother, are going to charge for replacement."
1,remote speakers,"they do not permit a hook up to a modern home theater as the remote rear speakers. to activate on my very exnsive sony, i have to use headphone jack which deactivates the other speakers."
1,Wireless Speakers Just Don't Work,"After reading the reviews I decided to give these speakers a shot. I had owned wireless video and audio devices like this in the past and they never worked correctly...I thought technology would have improved: nope.I set up the speakers as the rear channel in a 7.1 system because I didn't run enough wires through a wall.As soon as they were plugged in and setup the problems started: a loud hissing noise even when no signal was being sent to them and then one of them crackled every time any sound was sent to it by the stereo. I tried all different combinations of stereo volume, setup and placement...nothing worked. The speakers were no more than 20 feet from the transmitter.Do yourself a favor and run wires..."
1,Waste of money,I love the concept of wireless speakers - who wouldn't? But these just don't work. Forget the stated range. We ended up using an ipod or playing music streamed to computer speakers.
2,Not so good.,Too much static with snapping and popping - even after making all of the adjustments possible. The speakers are ONLY 10 feet away from the transmitter but still poor-to-marginal sound quality. Don't see how these could work 300 feet away(?) I do NOT recommend this product.
1,Don't Get Them Wet,"I read all available information on the speakers, including downloading the owners manual online. The information said repeatedly that they could be used ""virtually"" anywhere indoors or outdoors, but it took a call to the customer service department to learn that they are not approved for use anywhere they would be exposed to the elements -- outdoor use is strictly undercover. Luckily, I called before I took them out of the box and returned them. I did have the honor, however, of paying shipping charges both ways... >:-/"
1,worthless,"constant crackling noises... average sound quality when not crackling.they are now back in the box ready to be returned. don't buy....stick with wired speakers, it is more trouble but worth the effort in the long run."
1,AW-871 A good idea that lacks execution,I have to rate these speakers a poor performers based on the amount of noise they generate. I've had them for over three months and have used different combinations of distance and line of sight. I've tried all three channels and still cannot find a channel/positioning that allows me to listen to the music without a constant annoying hiss and occasional pops. I am in an urban area so it is possible there is a signal interfering but that is no excuse for a product that is not usable under ordinary circumstances. I really wanted them to work but they just have not come through.
3,"Easy to set up, but lacks great sound","I bought these with the intent of being able to play iTunes music in our living room - the computer is in the office. The distance is only about 25 feet, but I didn't want to run speaker wires. It took me about 10 minutes to set up, and seemed to transmit fine - the problems we had were (a) in 'stereo' mode, the stereo R speaker had quite a bit of static, and (b) once switched to 'mono' mode, the static went away, but the sound was less that spectacular. (What do you expect for $110, right?) For those reasons, we decided to return these speakers.Ultimately, we ended up purchasing an AirPort Express and some $40 Phillips speakers that plug into the AirPort, and for about $50 more, far better sound, no static, and the ability to control the speakers played to within iTunes. My hunch is that most of the price of the AR speakers is in the transmitter/receivers, leaving little for good speakers."
1,Overrated,"These speakers are way overrated.(1) They are huge, full bookshelf size.(2) The sound quality was terrible. The manual says that it works best for output that is at a constant level. That is fine for a standard TV, but receivers and DVD players don't output at a constant level.(3) The speakers have a blue light on their front that shows that the speakers are tuned in to the transmitter. The light is very large and is distracting.I was very disappointed. The speakers are on their way back for a refund."
4,Good investment for the price...,"Good range, but leans a little on the bass end of the spectrum. Have only used with the AC adapters so I do not know how long they would work with batteries.The surround sound system does a better job now with these hooked to the line out channels, adds a fuller sound with less volume.Purchased on sale for $109.00 which at that time was way below list price."
2,meh,"we've had our pair for two years now. the first speaker died in about 6 months and the other just died. the sound on them isn't great, but it's ok. the range isn't great and they wouldn't work outside. they are weird in that there is a button on the front which can turn them off, but they turn themselves back on randomly for no reason. before they fail completely, they get fuzzy, like am radio and the signal goes in and out. I'm shopping for new ones and saw these and thought I'd comment. I'm not buying another pair."
4,Probably the Best Hand Bookbinding Book Out There,"After reading this book I was able to complete my first ever sewn multiple signature hardbound book with little to no problems. Watson's numbered and illustrated instructions were simple and easy to follow and his techniques - especially on proper folding, measuring, squaring, mitering the corners and attaching bookcloth - proved very helpful. He even provides a section in the end of the book on how to make your own bindery tools, which is great because equipment such as sewing frames and press tubs can be quite expensive these days.Watson assumes that you have already collated the signatures for your text block. This is important because there are some things you'll have to consider when assembling the text block in the first place (such as squaring off the fore edge for a finished look) But overall, this is a useful reference for serious home bookbinders.I highly recommend it!"
5,best book for beginners,"I have purchased 6 books and 2 cd sets to get started in hand binding. This book by far will get you going with simple, straight forward instruction."
3,Hand bookbinding,My fault - I had hopes that it would contain a hand method for tape-binding small booklets. Should have looked further.
5,Best Collection of essays and Translations are easy to read,"I have read several different versions of Montaigne's essay collections, and have found this to be the best collection. Best of all, the foreign quotes are already in english -- you don't have to look for them in footnotes.Warren"
4,The Original French Essayist,Some authorities consider Montaigne the first essayist. His writing style is clear and his thought has common sense. Yet he is still encumbered by the classics. The ancients weigh on him like a stone. The celbrated erudition he displays in nearly every essay by quoting classical authors and envoking their names frequently is impressive but also distracting. I know that in expressing this opinion I differ from the majority of Montaigne's readers. But I believe that he had to much reverence for the classics.
5,"great book, great translation",I might have to say that Donald Frame's translation renders the work on a higher level than it was in its original french. Montaigne is great bed-time reading philosophy: reading him always puts me in a state of warm contented happiness. He talks about all kinds of great anecdotes from antiquity expressing the timelessness of humanity.
2,Asi asi!,"I love Marc Anthony's vocal range and passion, and I've been waiting to hear the follow-up to his outstanding English-language debut CD. ""Mended"" doesn't come anywhere close to what he delivered the first time. There's enough regurg music out there! Don't submerge this extraordinary voice with lukewarm arrangements. Perhaps for the next album Marc will corroborate with the great team he worked with on the first one. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"
4,Anthony Delivers,"Marc Anthony follow's up his last CD with a winner-delivering his fans, old and news, fresh up-tempo fare that is sure to brighten anyone's day. The radio singles ""I need you"" and ""I've got you"" are great listen's in the car, with the top up or down."
4,"buy ""Mended"", great album","I got just this album and I simply love it,the spanish beats and Marc's beautiful voice on 13 love songs from ""Mended"" make you listen to it over and overmy favorite songs are ""She mends me"" , ""I've got you"", and ""Tragedy"" , the rest of the album is also very romantic ,and easy listening, buy it, you won't regret!"
3,Abuelita Fanatica Desde nj,"I,ve Been A Fan Of Marc,s Since '92,This CD Is Not His Best Work.IHope He Gets Back To The Spine Tingling Awesome Music That Made Him The Best Selling Salsa( Hate That Word) Singer In The World.Check His Release ""Todo a Su Tiempo"" It,s Awesome.He,s Watering Down His Music And Delivery To Appeal TO A Wider Listening Public,My Advice Go Back To Your Roots, We Still Love You But Bring Back The Edge."
2,An Utter Bore,"It's amazing how slick, soulless production and lazy songwriting can sidetrack even the best vocalist. Unfortunately, this is the predicament that Marc Anthony finds himself in with his second English-language effort MENDED, which frankly is no better or worse than his uninspired debut. In the process,the lackluster production and songwriting has managed to quell whatever passion is usually found in his music. He's managed to surround himself yet again with a batch of boring, cookie-cutter AC babble('I've Got You' is the best you're going to get here,I'm afraid)--it seems as though he's threatening to become the next Michael Bolton. And I think we all know what happened there."
3,More Adult Conteporary Than The First English Album,"Nothing wrong with being more Lite Rock and possibly parting ways the mainstream top 40, but even artists like Chicago or even a Richard Marx and others alike, before and after, their songs were not as monotone or sleepy. His voice is still great, no question about that. But I have to agree with a recent review on this site that he needs a heavier hitter producer. Nothing against Corey Rooney and others that worked on this disc, but someone that has a voice like Marc Anthony should have someone like Quincy Jones and even Mutt Lange to put in better musical arrangements to accompany Marc's voice. The current song that is being played on the radio (track 3) and its Spanish version (track 13) are the best songs on the CD. Catch the other songs at your nearest elevator or dentist office, except ""Tragedy"". The voice alone does not make the album!"
2,so average it hurts!!,Marc Anothony Has a Good Voice but the material here doesn't explore it fully.it's safe run of the middle Production&Arrangements.it's the kind of Material Marc could do in His Sleep.I'd really dig Hearing Marc Anothony working with a Quincy Jones or Barry White.Guys that would have Him Backed by a String&Horn Section&would truly showcase His Range.this Kind of Album makes Him Appear like Everyone else out there&if you ever get a chance to truly Hear His Range You Know He is Better than Many Out here easily.
2,upset -peor-que paso'?-what happened here?,"I read the other review,and agree totally. I went to the store to buy this record with out researching it. Marc is little,but there is nothing ""little"" about his powerful voice.If you were to listen to this cd, you could not tell his range,emotion,or anything except they put out a pop cd. True Marc fans will be disappointed. I sugest you reasearch for your self before buying.escucha esta cd antes comprandolo. no le sentio en la voz, unfortunamente lo tuve un poquito mejor."
1,Ugh,"This is more Latin pop trash.....do we really need another Ricky Martin/Enrique somethingorother? And PLEASE don't tell me women actually find this scrawny, messy-haired, buck-toothed Ricky wannabe reject good-looking.....he has a hideous face, it scares me....."
2,"I always knew why Marc is known as a ""Latin Superstar""","Don't get me wrong, I've been a fan of Marc and his music all the way back to his days at Lepules' (Latin Club in NYC), and yes, that's going way back. I love to hear Marc....yet, not in English. If you love salsa and appreciate Marc's voice and talent, than you know what I'm talking about. He just doesn't do it for me with his English songs. I only like the ones he put's the congas and timbales to. Those cheesy lovey dovey slow songs just don't cut it. Now, his new latin cd....is very, very, good. ..."
3,alright,"Marc Anthony has slacked since his last release. This album has its peaks but lacks in some areas. Although the only album that I could listen to every song would be by 2nd Verse ... Other than that, there are some issues to be worked out. Marc could of done a better job."
3,Good One!,"This is really a good one, nothing more nothing less. All the tracks starting from ""Love won't get any better"" to ""Everything you do"" its good quality music. But his album just doesn't have that ""killer punch"". You know what I mean?Everything is so easy going and naive kind of a thing. Marc is a really good singer and should sing some good quality stuff.Overall: Something worth buying but not worth remembering.That's all, thanks for reading."
2,"Waste of his talent, waste of your cash","Marc Anthony is a major international star.This album is a major U.S. bust....at best. It's a classic example of what is done to top talent from other countries and cultures to make them palatable to Americans. Spare us, guys, you got that Spears person to make the sugar-coated goo for Middle America, let the real talent loose.Skip this soggy offering. Buy Marc's Spanish language recordings - it won't matter that you can't ""do"" Spanish, they burn!"
3,"""Okay""","Marc Anthony made a good first impression with this CD but after a while it got boring. My favorite song is I've Got You (track 3 on the CD). It is a very fast paced song that is a little confusing but I stuck with it. It is on two seperate times which I didn't get at all. Afterthat, the rest of the music was mediorcre. Not Marc Anthony's best album but not his worst."
4,Wonderful!,"Yet again Marc doesn't disappoint. This CD has one or two somewhat corny songs, but then again most CD's do. But other then that its great. I have all his CD's and listen to them all. I met him when I was in my early 20's (I'm 32 now) and still singing in Clubs. He's has to be the sweetest person, well as far as famous people go. He was genuine and nice. We got invited back stage & hung out with him & his band. His music makes you feel wonderful & makes you want to dance & sing along. We Love You Marc Anthony"
2,SORRY MARC...JUST DO YOUR THING.,"I have to say something about this Cd...I mean,I know Marc Anthony tried to do something different this time and he did it,but pop is not his thing...""MENDED"" is a weak album,with 2 or 3 good songs as ""Love Won't get any better"" ""She mends me"" and maybe even ""Tragedy"" that's all. I used to be a fan of Marc Anthony's Salsa albums...but this is actually pop from hell. Sorry Marc...Just do your thing."
2,not as good as his first english cd,"It just seems like mr. marc is trying way too hard in english. nothing will compare to his music in spansih ever!tragedy is ok, but it's a weak I need to know. This attempt is a tragedy! sorry my marc...please sing in Spanish.."
1,He looked so pretty on the cover...,"I bought it. But...I'll never play it again. As the amazon.com reviewer put it...""Anthony is a powerful, fiery vocalist, and he deserves better than run-of-the-mill arrangements"". That's well-said - he deserved much better than what's presented. My tastes are genre~less so i had no preconcieved requirements but it was just too boring to pay attention to.. i couldn't even make it thru each song without skipping thru to the ends. It's not even good enough to let play in the background during a mindless task. I truly disliked it. I think he's got a great voice and he takes a pretty picture, but the bland sameness of every song was mentally too much to take for me. It was torture. I'm sure he'll do much better next time. No one's perfect. My fingers are crossed for him in the next musical venture of this very talented singer :)"
3,"Good album, Good music","This album is very catchy and beautiful melodies. I didn't give it a five star because I feel it isn't as strong as five star cds should be nor even four star cds should be. But I liked it. Good love songs, catchy ballads, relaxing..worth buying!"
3,"Love Marc Anthony, but not this CD!!","I adored his last album and couldn't wait 'til this CD, Mended, was released. I ran out and bought it as soon as it came out. Now that I have listened to it three times, I am very disappointed. In this CD, Marc Anthony's music is watered down and over-produced. It is criminal the way that his powerful voice has been drowned out by ultra generic pop-junk in this CD. Also, the lyrics and the singing lack sincerity. Consequently, this CD lacks the feeling and the magic of the last one. I'm stilling going to his concert in August because I love his earlier music so much, but I will wait for the reviews to come out before I rush out and buy his next CD!!"
5,great book,"As I read Ms Gabay's book, it never felt like I was reading a fantasy novel. She has truly woven a convincing tale of a modern woman facing life threatening circumstances and, in the process, finding a new life. A life that is free from all the constraints of modern civilization and is much more civilized. This is a great book. I really loved it and can't wait for Ms Gabay's next novel."
1,Reading for 5th graders,This book was a joke. It is something that might be great for a 10 year old reader as the information was stale an so common sense. To pay its pricewould be preposterous when there are many books out there that contain this info. and a whole lot more. This book will not make you into a good actor. I would recommend you save the money and buy a book that has more in depth resources. Not this flimsy thing.
3,A decent private-eye story,"A little thin -- I made through it in a few hours -- and a little more prolonged its ending should've been...it's got a fairly interesting cast, but if I were to make a suggestion to the writer, I'd say that while she gets, for example, the general idea of romantic passages (for example, Ms. Faye being asked out, etc.), once in a while she writes one sentence too much, an expression of sentiment that's unnecessary. And like I said before, it didn't end when the reader finally figures out the culprit."
2,This dame is all wet!,"A fairly good period mystery is spoiled by attempting to use the venicular of the 40s. The technique is over used, distracting, and if the purpose was to make the heroine more distinctive, while it may have, it certainly did not enhance the story. I won't buy anymore of this series."
3,"Good story, annoying writing","Enough with the ""ya"" instead of you and the ""goin"" instead of going. Who really speaks like that? We get the point - Faye's a real salt of the earth gal but after a while it seems affected and pretentious, which is the opposite of what should be conveyed."
2,1940's Slang Too Distracting,"This story is set in the 1940's, and people talked a little differently back then. So an occasional use of slang from that period would be appropriate. But does it need to be in every paragraph? The female PI talks in 40's slang that's so distracting, I stopped reading on page 20. Here are some examples:""Putting on the feedbag"", ""freeze my tootsies"", ""fell on my keister"", ""a cigar clenched between his choppers"", ""eyeballed my gams"", ""opened my big yap"", ""coppers"", ""hooper dooper"", ""John Q. Public"", ""ankling down the street"". And that's just a partial list from the first 10 pages.Used that frequently, the slang kept me from getting involved in the story. ""This Dame for Hire"" might have a good mystery at its center, but unfortunately, I'll never finish the book."
2,Fun story-odd dialect!,"I wasn't born in the 1940s (the setting of this novel). My parents weren't even born! So, the slang and NYC dialect in this novel were foreign and difficult. I liked the characters and the story but couldn't get past the words! They seemed contrived and fake.....I couldn't lose myself in the story because the dialogue never seemed real. Maybe this is really how people talked back then but I could've used less of the gum smacking, chain smoking slang!"
3,The ending is too transparent,"I had a fun time reading this book, especially because of the lingo and references. I've seen a lot of movies in this genre but had never read a story like this before.That being said, the identity of the killer is obvious LONG before it is purposely revealed in the book, at least it was to me and I'm usually wrong about figuring out 'whodunnit'.But it was a fun enough break for me to want to read the second book in the series."
2,Missed opportunity,"Great idea but the it fails. I love the era, I can live with the jargon and the plot is unoriginal, not bad; but This Dame is the dumbest detective I've ever read. A woman who stumbles along to success. Whenever we see her wheels turning she's usually heading in the wrong direction. I haven't even finished have a chapter to go, but I know how this will end and getting there was torture."
4,Entertaining Noir Mystery,"Scoppettone keeps the dialogue and suspects humming along in this book. The narrator is a female PI who fell into the position when her boss signed up to fight the Axis.The settings and details are good without being over-detailed, and the atmosphere of WWII NYC rings true.There is plenty of humor, and enough zing to make this book a fine choice to spend a couple of days with."
4,artist's apprentice,This little book is perfect for taking down notes on compositions or quick sketches when the moment strikes. It can go where ever you go either in your pocket or purse. A most perfect companion.
1,didn't like it!,"This book was really hokey. The author has an odd way of writing that feels very disjointed to me. Also, I didn't like the way that both the rape victims in the story were treated by their significant others. Neither man could supposedly deal with the rape and left them. I am sure this happens sometimes, but I feel it did a diservice to men. Most men do NOT leave their spouse when they are raped or blame their spouse for the rape."
2,A Soap Opera in Book Form,"This was my first Fern Michaels book and my last. I bought the book because the story line seemed interesting. Unfortunately, the characters are rather robotic, unbelievable and the dialogue is ridiculous. This book is on par with one of those cheap romance novels you can find at the local five-and-dime store. More should be expected from a ""famous"" author."
2,If you like curt dialouge,"Anyone in the helping (psychiatry, psychology, social work) field is going to find this book repulsive. Jane's career is an insult to the helping profession. It was an easy read and tried to conjure up suspense with the multi-layered story lines, but it never really got me that invested in any of the story lines. This is my first Fern Michael's book and unfortunately, probably my last."
1,"Bad plot, flat characters, poor writing.","I haven't read any of the other books by this author, but everything that makes up a book is lacking in this one. Jane is the most unbelievable mental health (un)professional anyone could ever imagine; her romance is contrived without any sense of realism. The dialogue couldn't occur between people who had passed through adolesence. The characters aren't. The plot is ridiculous."
2,I must be missing something...,"This was my first Fern Michaels book. I really wanted to like this book, the back cover sounded so promising and the clincher for me was that the book was a NY Times bestseller. How could I go wrong? While I like Miss Michaels' writing style, I didn't bond with any of the characters. Some of the subplots seemed too far-fetched and almost silly. (The dog barking on cue after the main character makes a statement or asks a question was particularly tiresome and a little too Disney-like for me.) I had a very hard time making it through the book but finished it anyway. Since Fern Michaels seems to have a legion of fans out there, I must be missing whatever it is that everyone can't seem to get enough of in her books. If you are one of these diehards, you'll probably enjoy the book, however for the first-time Fern Michaels reader, I'd advise you to skip this one."
2,Plain Jane is Plain Bad,"I agree that this starts out great and just ends up disappointing the reader. As previously mentioned, anyone in a helping profession will be totally turned off by this. To suggest that a physician or other health care professional is less than what they ought to be because they ""don't get personally involved"" is rubbish. Ms. Michaels has no concept of the reality of this kind of profession, and it is glaringly obvious in the completely unprofessional behavior of her main character. I couldn't wait to finish it & doubt that I'll read another. It's a problem when you don't care for the main character and start to root for the ""bad guys""."
1,Not so good......,"First of all do you know any man who would use the phrase ""flopsy-doodle"" to describe a hat? My husband would have to relinquish his manhood if he ever said that. My biggest problem with this book is the dialog was not realistic. You could tell the author was probably older and all of her characters sounded like someones Great Aunt Penny, even the men. The plot seemed to meander quite a bit too. One hundred pages into the book I was still wondering what it was about. This book was so smarmy I couldn't even bring myself to finish it."
1,Sorry I wasted my time,Story starts out interesting and then goes downhill from there when ghosts start appearing and her elderly god parents decide to train K-9 dogs. The shrink sessions are pretty good though.
3,Plain Jane,This was a fun book to read. It is not really believable. There are some endearing characters in the book. It is worth reading.
1,Did not bother to finish,"I read anything and everything, but this was so horrible I couldn't finish it. Characters must be believable even in fiction. Not even the dogs could save this book for me."
1,Started off with a bang!,"A first time reader of this author, I was highly pleased with the interesting, well-written opening, however, things went rapidly down-hill. Jane was a total contridiction. Either she is ugly and mousy, or confident and beautiful. The ghost scenes were great, but the the interaction between Jane and her mom left a lot to be desired. There should have been more suspense, I kept expecting the rapists to go after Jane, but that storyline just faded away. I am all for happy endings, but appreciate the characters working harder to achieve it!"
2,Not one of her good ones...,"I normally enjoy a Fern Michaels story, but this I did not care for at all. Not just because the horrific events at the beginning of the book, but the additional cramming of just about every romance novel story thread into it as well. To wit: the aforementioned Revenge/Recovery from a Tragedy/Crime; the Handsome Co-Worker Who May Be a Love Interest; the Crazy/Eccentric Relatives Who Mean Well; the Animals Who Seem to Know More About What's Going On Than the Humans; and finally, the Heroine Communicates With a Ghost Who Needs Help... I think there are one or two more in there as well. It's like there was some sort of deadline where she had to turn in one of each type of story, and ended up shoving them all into one book. Any one of these themes, perhaps two, should have been more than sufficient, but all together they were very distracting. There are much better Fern Michaels stories out there, much better than this one..."
4,Fine WWII suspense/espionage/thriller,"The treacherous villainous woman in this thriller is really excellent around which the film twists. She will surprise you guaranteed and for the gents, she's quite a looker too.Great supporting cast, high suspense espionage and just what your looking for. Based on documentary intelligence records and really excellent first of the realism photoed movies shot on actual locations. First of the post WWII noir-based genres. Good curling-up entertainment with Lloyd Nolan also who is good."
4,spy movie,This was an enjoyable recounting of an actual spying event. I enjoyed the mixture of documentary footage. The ending was interesting. It was amusing to see how old time equipment was used in protecting the US.
3,An Ode to the F.B.I.,"The film follows through an FBI case regarding German spies in New York City stealing information about the making of the atomic bomb. At the time, the semi-documentary style of the movie was groundbreaking and influential. The film does provide an interesting (although obviously entirely uncritical) look at FBI proceedings, but, in terms of film noir, its quite disappointing. Star William Eythe is very dull and his character is very uprighteous. He never doubts his actions for a second. There is also no femme fatale to entice him. (Signe Hasso does make a good impression as the villain.) And, given the docu-drama style, the film lacks the visual games between lights and shadows that have come to define what we regard as film noir. (There are no lights peeping through the blinds here.) I enjoyed the film and was glad to see it, but quite frankly I don't think I'll ever watch it again."
1,Cat's Game,"My seven yr. old got this as a present. The game itself is attractive and well constructed. However, it drastically lacks any strategic challenge. The game says for ages 5 and up. But, my seven yr. old was way too old for it. At least with tic-tac-toe there was some challenge until every game became a ""cat's game."" With Topitop EVERY game was a ""cat's game"". It would be more appropriately used for teaching a two yr. old to stack, but,the game pieces would be a choking hazard. It baffles me to read that this game has won awards. You are better off leaving this one on the shelf."
3,Good moisture in lipstick,"The lipstick is rich in moisture and wears for a few hours. I have found, though, that the lipstick will not stay ""out"" during application. Instead it pushes back into the tube."
4,"amazing, a wonderful discovery !","This is a mixture of Chopin, Scriabine and innovative ideas showing that the composer knew how to balance musical heritage and influences with his own personality.Wonderful ! I should have discovered Scharwenka long ago ...."
3,Attempts to straddle the fence,"Hundredth Window iterates the familiar mantra of individuals feeling increasingly squeezed by the loss of privacy as computer networks and databases grease the ""friction"" of life that previously resisted such invasiveness. Privacy fundamentalist will decry the thinly veiled stumping for industry self-regulation and the appeal for responsible handling of PII. It was an easy read, plain and balanced. The fence straddling might call into question the intentions of the authors (founders of Truste.Org) and I wouldn't call this essential reading. I'd check out Database Nation or Ben Franklin's Web Site first. Still, this book speaks more to the average citizen who feels distress by the loss of privacy, but isn't sure what to do or why."
4,"Zondervan NIV Study Bible, Compact; Updated Edition","This was a very nice looking Bible. I was very pleased with it's appearance. I suppose it was my own fault but the word ""Compact"" did not really register. I should have realized that the print was going to be very small. It would be nice if the description on the size of the type was a little clearer. Thanks."
5,Great Study Bible,"I bought this bible over a year ago and I have kept it in the box it comes with, so it is in perfect condition. The leather on it has a realy rice feel to it and doesn't get scratched easily. The notes on each page come in handy especially if you use the bible for school or even just for church, it gives a god understanding of EVERY verse. Another nice feature is the introduction of each chapter. It gives information such as the author, date written, and the significance of the chapter. Also has many time-lines, maps, and special pages. pages are extremely thin since it is a compact study bible, but they are pretty tough."
2,Type is not dark enough & read return policy carefully,"I purchased this bible because I wanted a smaller bible that still had all of the study helps. I expected the type to be small. That would not be a problem if the type were at least darker. I don't understand why they could not make the type as dark as the subject headings. At least that would have made it more readable. The red type is even worse. It is so faded that it is almost impossible to read. I am returning this bible and will have to look elsewhere for a small study bible. BUYER BEWARE: Because I opened the book to look at it, Amazon charged me 50% on my refund for ""obvious signs of use"". Mind you I looked at the book for all of 15 minutes determining that I didn't want it. A book would have more ""obvious signs of use"" at a bookstore. I will think twice before ever purchasing another item from this company."
1,Bible IS NOT COMPLETE,"The Bible is MISSING part of Genesis!!!!! I hate to say it, but that is why it is so cheap!!!! So if you are looking for a whole Bible, do NOT buy this!!!! But, from what I have read, the rest of the Bible is there..so if you are just looking at the NEW Testement...it is fine...."
3,"Nice book, font too small however.","I gave this Bible as a gift to someone who has been hesitant to read the more difficult versions of the Bible. Unfortunately, she has packed it away and doesn't read it because the font is too small."
5,Zondervan NIV Study Bible,"The Bible was exactly as described. Shipping hit some trouble, but seller was quick to resolve the issue. Thank you!"
3,Nice quality bible,"The quality of this bible is very nice, but I had to return it because the print was microscopic. Otherwise, very nice."
4,Compact Bible,"Good Bible. The print is not really boldly printed and the leather is a rather 'off' color of brown, but I would buy it again."
5,Perfect Condition,"This product arrived quickly and in brand new, unopened condition. Everything was very easy. Thanks!"
3,"Nice Bible, but WRONG COLOR SHOWN!","This is a nice enough Bible, though the picture shows two entirely different colors of leather than the actual item colors.The picture shows two tones of pink, but the actual item is a dark brown-burgundy and tan!I ordered this item based partly on the color, and had to find a different one to give to the person this one had been intended for. Originally I had intended this as a gift for a young lady, but ended up giving it as a gift to a young man."
2,Binding was broken,Binding was broken. This product was disclosed as New and it was not. Had the purchase receipt folded inside the pages too.....
2,Study Bible,"This Bible is nicely ""appointed"". The leather cover is very nice. It's well done for an individual with extraordinarly good eyesight who wants it for individual study and does not intend to share the experience with anyone else. Every page has enormous amounts of information - so much that the printing is exceptionally tiny. You have to use a ruler or keep a finger on the each line as you read or it's easy to lose your place in the fine print. No way could you share this experience with another reader. If that's the kind of thing you're into, this book appears to be durable and well done for years of dependable service. We returned it because it did not meet our true needs."
2,Zondervan NIV Compact Study Bible,"This is too small, can barely read the print at my age and my husbands the print was too small even with our readers on. If you have great eyesite this would be perfect for a teen.I've asked to replace this one, hope that I will be able to do so.Zondervan NIV is one of the best bibles out there to help us understand the verbage of the bible so much better."
2,Bad Batteries & Phone,"Maybe it was just the phone I bought b/c I haven't seen any other similar reviews....but I thought I loved this phone at first and then after about 1 month the screen on the handset kept saying ""Warning - Use rechargeable batteries only"" The only batteries that I ever used in it were the rechargeable ones that came in the box with the phone. Now the phone works for about 2 minutes and then I have to keep it on the charger all the time!"
3,Great product except for clicking sounds,This phone has everything I was looking for and then some. The cordless phone works off of two standard AA batteries. There is even an extra charger in the base too. The features on the phone are pretty cool. I gave pictures to everyone who is calling me. One problem that I do have is clicking sounds. It has gotten so bad that I often hunt for another phone in my house to switch to. I am starting to consider another purchase other then VTech.
1,Try calling them before you buy!!,"So these phones work fairly well, but here's the problem, before you buy, try calling their numbers and see what you get.What you'll get is an endless grave of automated responses giving you all the ways you can fix your problem, and NO way to reach someone if either the problem you're having isn't on the menu or if their fixes don't work.AND you'll take an hour to do this before you realize that you're NEVER going get any help from a human. EVER.Buy at your own peril, and don't say I didn't warn you!"
3,What is correct model # for this phone?,"I was reading consumer reviews on these phones and noticed that Amazon had the title listed as a 5867 but under product details it talks about a 5866. Okay, and the real model number is.......? I want to look at these in a store before I order online. Can anyone please tell me the correct model number for this phone? If both model numbers are actually in production, then I won't know which to look at. Thanks."
2,Nothing without Owen Wilson,"Most of these songs are straight off of albums you can get at almost any thrift store for a buck or less.Despite what other reviewers might have you think, the only reason to get this is for the Owen Wilson song-- it gets 10 out of 10 for hilarity."
2,"Where's BM, Aerosmith?","I can't believe Barry Manilow and Aerosmith were left out. Looking at the quality of some of the other songs on the soundtrack, maybe it is better for them not to be associated with it. It is bad enough that the Carpenters tune is missing but ""Can't smile without you"" opens the movie and ""Sweet emotion"" ends it. The soundtrack should have followed that formula."
3,"Good, but could have been better...","This soundtrack isn't a total loser. There are some definite highlights such as; ""Dazz"" by Brick an all-time favorite. Chicago's ""Old Days"" is a great 70's tune and a great way to open this disc. ""Afternoon Delight"" is truly is a delightful piece of pop confection. I always enjoy anything by Bill Withers. But the album would have been better without the cover versions by Owen Wilson, Dan Finnerty, and Brigette Romanek. The originals are far superior.A few songs in the movie that were not included would have made the soundtrack much better. One is Aerosmith's ""Sweet Emotion"", a great 70's hard rock tune. The other is the Carpenters' classic ""We've Only Just Begun"". I'm sure though that royalties for ""We've Only Just Begun"" are very expenisve."
5,Good music,Good music from years ago in the 70s. Great listening to lift spirits. Music to motivate anyone bored. Love this!
5,Starsky And Hutch,This is an awesome soundtrack. It is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
1,Switch & Bate,"I ordered from these folks over a month ago, have sent two emails, and still do not have my product. I warn anyone not to order from them."
5,great for teen boy,This was a great gift for my teenage boy who asks a million questions about all sorts of things!
2,size was a disappointment,"I was extrememly disappointed when I saw the size of this ""mini-book"". I purchased it for a gift for my father-in-law and was almost embarrassed to send it."
2,Not what I had hoped for.,"There is too much fluff in this book. I was looking for a book with plans and ideas for building differentstyle doors. Instead what I go were chapters on setting up a woodworking shop, how lumber reacts to moisture and how I should select llumber, how to use a jointer and how to make different kinds of joints- all of which I am already familiar with. The final fifty pages or sowere plans for a few doors plus a gallery of photos of different doors. Too many woodworking books do this.Walter Plaut"
3,"Building doors yes, hanging & adjusting, no.","Good book for building a door from scrach. Not a good book for hanging, repairing or adjusting doors."
1,Building Doors and Entryways,"Do not buy this book unless you are building a new house, addition or remodeling. Tells you little about making doors and designs that make sense for the average home owner."
4,Better than most,"I wasn't to sure about this one as most "" reviews "" along this line are pretty sketchy and use music performed by performers other than who you're buying the disc for but I was pleasently surprised by this one.If you are a Pink Floyd Fan or a David Gilmour fan most of the information here won't be a surprise but it is presented well and for once the music is performed by Gilmour and in my opinion is worth buying."
1,not so much,I would definitely think twice before purchasing this DVD. I'm a huge Floyd / Gilmour fan and this falls way short of what I hoped for ! Mostly stills and not much complete misic !!!!
4,Great perspective on development of Jewish thought,"A collection of articles detailing the nature of contentious debates in Jewish history. Although the style is somewhat academic, the book is a useful source both for students of religion and history."
3,"Easy, simple designs","The designs in this book are easy, simple and small. This book would be appropriate for a novice stitcher or anyone wanting to do small projects, such as coasters or trivets. The author does provide a good variety of designs, including lighthouses, ships, and shells. The graphs are in black and white, but fairly easy to read. However, there are no pictures of the finished project for most of the designs."
4,Hardcore grifting...,This is a well-acted and disturbing film about the life style of grifters. Seeing Annette Bening prance around in different stages of undress make it worth watching alone.
4,Well-Done Classic Tragedy,"This is a classic tragedy set in the modern era that in some respects harkens back to ancient Greece.The parts are all well played, those by Anjelica Huston and Annette Bening with a what-could-be-called stylized grace and delicacy that is almost hypnotic.I'm a real sucker for cameo appearances by really great character actors, so I have to say Pat Hingle's and Henry Jones's performances gave me the most pleasure. It was good to be able to watch them again! Elmer Bernstein's score was, as always, brilliant. John Cusack's performance gave a firm and strong point of origin for the whole film."
5,Great for taping dog ears,I used this tape when wrapping my doberman's ears. This product is excellent and it dissolves quickly when you use Unisolve with it. Does not hurt the dog at all. No pulling!
2,Somewhat interesting,"the author seems somewhat 'full of himself' - has quite an ego, which comes through in this mildly interesting tale..."
1,Ego gets in the way.,"This started out promising, but I found the author's ego got in the way of what should have been a very moving storyline. He related several job-related incidents of working in the coroner's office of New York City, and then switched to the upheaval of 9/11. At this point, he seemed to be a one man savior for the identification process, and never missed a chance to question his superiors, or note the time he personally spent. With the exception of mentioning a very few co-workers, which he recruited, he barely mentions the huge staff effort to accomplish the identification of 9/11 victims."
1,Wanted to hear more,Very disappointing read. Seemed to be more about the author and his bragging than about the morgue or 9/11.
2,The actual cases were interesting but the author is very self-absorbed,"I expected this book to be much better than it turned out to be. It was somewhat informative, and the descriptions of the work itself were moderately interesting. However, the author spent so much time regaling the readers in his expertise, his compassion and his many talents that it became almost a farce. Over and over again, we were subjected to the details of his magnificence. I was very disappointed as, given the subject matter, this had the ability to be an outstanding book."
4,Worth a read,"Dead Center covers a lot of ground - it's a compelling first-person account of the aftermath of the World Trade Center disaster, from scientific, professional, and personal levels, but also illuminating in its description of the Medical Examiners Office, forensic methodology, and relations between that department and the police. It does have a lot of material included for shock value, but it's not as much gruesome as breaking of taboos about discussion of these sorts of thing - and there's a fair amount of objectification and humor in those descriptions.There's also the occasional policy discussions on current practice and law regarding mortality reporting and other issues that relate to forensics - buried in the text but worth consideration. Recommended."
1,"Self-serving, go-nowhere book","I thought this book would be about how the NY Medical Examiner's office reacted to the events of 9/11. But it isn't. It is about the author's journey to becoming a medical examiner, written in the first person, and it is poorly written, pendantic and over-arching. The first chapter(s) are spent letting us know of his personal career journey, which as far as I can tell consists of him trying to make a doctor's salary without being a doctor. The rest of the chapters then tell us about how we, the general public, could never do his job because death is something we really can't deal with. Only one chapter chronicles 9/11. Sorely disappointing book clearly written to captialize on 9/11."
1,Misleading... This book is about the author and his ego...,"One of most boring books I have ever read. The book's cover leads one to believe that it's about all the behind the scenes stuff at a Medical Examiner office, matter of fact, it says exactly that. Unfortunately, this is about the life of the author, his rise to be a coroner's ""investigator"", with very little in between about the real goings on in the medical examiner's office. There's a lot of paperwork shuffling in his office, but not much about the real down and dirty stuff.If I were you, I'd pass on this one. I wish I had."
4,"Good ME details, less so forensics","The book does a nice job showing the life of a New York Medical Examiner's investigator in the 1990s to just after 9/11. There are a number of interesting details and glimpses of the author's personal life and the toll his job takes on it.There is some discussion of forensics as it relates to the medical examiner's office. My chief complaint is that these are superficial. The author rarely seems to touch on the complexity of some forensic determinations and the controversies over some of the accepted wisdom in this area. Thus, it is a good guide to procedure, but those interested in forensic details may wish a more specialized book."
4,Unique mystery,"I gravitate towards golden age mysteries and don't read a lot of sci-fi or straight fantasy books, so maybe this isn't unique, as I think. But for a mystery it is certainly different, and like the author's other book, The Edge of Running Water, very satisfying (although it share one sort of annoying attribute with the other novel in that it tells you something is going to happen at the beginning and then leads you up the path to it for the entire book.)It's a well written story and even though you do know what it's leading to, the journey is well worth the time it takes getting there.P.S. It seems this was printed under the name Jane Land as well, although I can't find information about that. Anyone know?"
3,"Interesting, but dated","This novel has been listed as a classic must-read for hard core science-fiction people.However, no matter how interesting I found it, the story is ploddingly paced -- really a short story expanded to novel length.Fun, but a yawner nonetheless.Still, the writer's style was interesting enough to motivate me to possibly read his only other novel -- sigh, someday before I die, maybe."
1,"Gave me dizzy spells, thought I was going to have a stroke.","Took awhile to narrow down this as being the cause of the dizzy spells, but it's now been pinned down for sure. I doubt it has anything to do with the brand, I just stopped taking Brewer's Yeast supplements altogether and since the health claims for the item are not exactly rock solid I just decided not to mess with it anymore."
2,great when it works but...,i have no problems with this phone when it works but the durability/reliability is an issue. i bought 3 additional phones and 2 out of the three were out of commission within a few months.
1,This phone is NOT hearing aid compatible.,"This is a beautiful looking phone, but, despite what the specs say, it is not compatible with hearing aids using a T-coil. It produces that loud hum that one cannot hear through."
1,Defective Phone,This phone is flat out defective. I give this phone a -5 star if possible.The phone does not work.1. The handset and base station has a difficulty remembering each other. I have to constantly enter the base station's id code on the handset.2. The handset dies after dialing. I charged the battery overnight and it just has some serious bugs.3. The base station is an energy hog. Consumes 21.7 watts per hour-- multiply that by a year. Devices like these should not consume this much energy.4. This phone looks good in picture. But the construction and feel of the product is very cheap.I'm returning this phone today. I could have given this one star if it actually worked.
4,Good mix between do it yourself and snap together models,"After being Warhammer buildings, I wanted something a little easier to put together. This is it. The wall and other pieces just snap together with ease. These sets are awesome for gaming since you can create all sorts of building types quickly.If you are thinking about purchasing this remember that there is no single building design, so it will take a little imagination to create buildings. It set is gray, so unlike the front of the package, you will have to paint it to get that weathered look.Pros- Easily snapped together walls and accessories- Can use multiple Pegasus sets to create large and complex structures- Doors openCons- No floor and roofs available- If your going to more it around, you will have to glue the smaller accessories- Some of the plastic parts coming off the sprues will need to be shaved a little before use"
2,"Fine Writer, but depressing, ridiculous story","Richards has a way with dialogue and the book is readable, but the story is so gloomy and the characters do not ring true. Everyone is either too noble or too villainous. The plot requires characters to behave like idiots. If they didn't, the novel would much, much shorter. Because the characters are one dimensional, it's impossible to feel anything for them."
3,I gave up.,"Fine writing, beyond a doubt. I read widely and skip the fluff, but this was just sooooooooo unmitigatedly depressing, page after page of utter misery, that I could not go on. If you are really STRONG, get it, read it. Otherwise, you may never reach the mercy. I didn't."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"This novel is the most stunning piece of literature I have ever read. David Adams Richards is truly one of the best Canadian writers of our time. His words and style of writing go together flawlessly. I must admit that I only read the book because it was lent to me. I now own it and have read it a second time. The characters in this novel all explore different morals and understandings of life. Some may interpret it to be depressing but it makes you appreciate the worth of life. It is the story of unending tragedy, yet always filled with hope. It is an inspirational novel and once read will give you a different meaning of life."
4,Could Not Put It Down,"As other reviewers point out, this book is challenging, but in the end, you can't put it down. The characters are chillingly real and indisputably tough. Richards flawlessly evokes the chill, hard desperation of the Henderson family. Penniless, friendless, and almost hopeless, they endure much more than seems possible. If you're not afraid to venture into their cold reality, you'll find yourself well rewarded."
2,What am I missing??,"I have just read this book for our Book Club and found it a struggle to get through. I slogged through it until about half way then skipped to the end just so I would know what happened and be able to discuss it a little at our meeting. I found the writing style pedantic and the plot to be unrelentingly dismal and bleak. And, no, I don't need to read about happy people and happy things--I just want some characters I can believe in and root for! Richards' symbolism was so obvious--come on: the villians' names were, and I'm not kidding, McVicer, Devlin and Pit. Give me a break! I definitely don't understand why this book continues to get 4 and 5 stars from readers. What on earth am I missing here?? For brilliant writing style and insight into the human condition go find a Michael Ondaaje book."
4,held my interest,"Not a perfect novel IMO. I felt for the first 2/3 especially as tho it was set in the 30s, rather than relatively modern times.There were some smallish things that bothered me like 9000 people gathered in the town hall of a community that sounded from the way the story was written, as tho it might have been a community of about 200 people at most. And it was more than a bit repetitious on some details.But, the book was very big on ""I wonder what will happen next?"" so I didn't get bored and quit it.If you enjoy books about situations that seem for most part hopeless and bleak, (as I do) you'll like this one."
3,Numeracy,"Intriquing book that gets lost so,ewhere arou d 3/4 mark. Author could not keep my interest after all characters aged and had little to say. For the most part beautifully written"
2,"Fine Dialogue, but the idiot plot triumphs.",Richards has an engaging writing style. It's simple and direct. The plot however concerns a family victimised by townsfolk you'd see in Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The villains are written as completely one note. There is no depth to them and the Richardson clan is so meek and idiotic (confessing to crimes for no reason) that you feel nothing for them. Save your money and read the co-winner for the Giller Prize.
1,For masochists only,"The thing is, Richards is a superb writer. His sentences flow, his images are wonderful. There is not a false step in his choice of words. BUT: it doesn't work, for me at least. I found the story absolutely stupifying, boring, and depressing - I did not want to find out what happened to his miserable characters, nor was I pulled in to the mysteries of Nowhere, New Brunswick. It confirmed, however, all the prejudices I had about the bleakness of that part of the country. I found it similar to watching those sleepy Canadian movies from the 70s, experimental and bravely non-Hollywood, but finally unwatchable - you could tell within 10 seconds that you were watching a Canadian movie just by the texture of the film, and the same thing happens with Richards. Why must all Canadian prize-winning novels be set in small towns? Let this be a lesson to all aspiring writers: you can be a master with words, but that doesn't mean you can write a story."
2,"¿Why they call them ""phase coated"" if its prism is not phase coated?",Phase coated prisms are very expensive. And the name of this binocular is just a fraud. You can not say coatings in the lens are yield by phases to mean that the prism is phase coated. Two completelly different things. BEWARE.
3,Typos?,"Enjoying the story but there is an annoying amount of 'typos'. Words like ""Barty"" show up as Barry. ""Chevvy"" appears as Chewy. Is there something wrong with the way the book is processed for e reading?"
3,Somerhalder fan will like,Not my favorite film. Having Ian Somerhalder in it was the best part. With out him the film would have little to recommend it. I got a cheap used copy so I did not invest a lot.
4,"Tons of information, except",if you have a premature baby. I felt the premmie section just glossed over the issues and did not give any real advice. I will end up pumping and bottle feeding for the long haul and I did not feel like their was any information of this as well.PS- I was in a hospital where 80% of women breastfeed and had daily visits from the lactation consultant once my son started feeding in the NICU.
4,This is an excellent book on breastfeeding!,"I read most of this book while I was still pregnant and preparing for breastfeeding my baby. I found the information was clear and straight-forward. The tone may have been a little too ""preechy"". For instance, I had awfully sore nipples in the first few days, and the book said that you only get sore nipples if you are doing it incorrectly. It took a very good lactation consultant to get me over that hump. However, the authors are encouraging successful breastfeeding, whatever that means for you and your baby. There are sections about troubleshooting, supplimenting, going back to work and pumping, weight loss and exercise, and sexuality. The only part I haven't read yet is the chapter on weaning."
4,Good Info,This book helped me feel more prepared for nursing before the birth of my baby. I also reviewed it a bit in the beginning when I had questions or concerns.
5,Excellent resource!!!,I used this book for both of my daughters (now 23 and 16). It has been revised several times since I originally used it. I am a pediatric office nurse and constantly recommend this book to my patients who are just starting out. This book is an extremely valuable tool to successfully breastfeed whether it is your first child or your fifth!!!
2,No help when having problems.,"For every question I needed a detailed answer to, I found none. This book was a waste of money. When I needed to pump due to some problems I couldn't find the info I really needed (like how much milk to give my baby). It's one of those die-hard breastfeeding books but, there's not much to help if you do have difficulties."
1,Discouraging,"I found the book to be very vague and condescending. I felt the underlying message of the book was that if you do not succeed at breastfeeding, you have failed your child."
2,too vague,"No matter what problem I was having, when I looked it up in this book, I still wasn't sure what was going on. For instance, when trying to wean my baby, I was experiencing soreness and pain. I would think that is a common problem that needs addressing, but there is only a vague mention in here. Or, when I was wondering what effect my diet had on the baby, or if I was sick, how would that affect him? I feel these are basic things that all women would want to know. If you compare this book to ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" and it's sequel, ""What to Expect the 1st Year"" it pales by comparison. I never had to refer to any other source while those were around. If you want a handy resource while you're breastfeeding, keep looking."
3,Lousy Shipping Time,The album is great - Amazon service (shipping) was the worst I've seen from them - almost 3 weeks.
3,Hero is a little disappointing in content. A poet's novel.,"It would have been good to have other things this Russian author wrote, such as his poetry included. The book is so brief and so narrow a focus that it wets our appetite. A sad biographical note."
5,Great historical account,"Not only is this book a great philosophical account of Pechorin's mind, but it is an appropriate representation of the 1830s in Russia. It's depiction of treatment of women (rich and poor) as well as the ""other"" races in Russia is outstanding. This is undoubtedly Lermontov's best work. One only wished he had lived longer."
5,Best Translation!!! - Fascinating Characters!!!,"If you already know you want to read Hero of Our Time, then this is the translation you want. Vladimir Nabokov, who translated this book with his son, is himself a Russian writer, who achieved such a high level of understanding of English as an emigre that he wrote his books and stories in both languages! The translation is fluid and Nabokov's footnotes are invaluable. He claims to have done this translation because he saw all the others as inferior.As to the book itself, it is fascinating for the way in which Lermontov toys with you, inhibiting you from a clear sense of what kind of person Pechorin is. Questions concerning point of view and structure makes the book a fascinating read over and over again."
5,A classic and exciting,"Perhaps the best Russian book not widely known outside of Russia, with Dead Souls by Gogol a close second. This is not a tennis or golf ranking, so read them both. Lermontov starts in the middle and then goes back to beginning and moves on to the end. The Great Gatsby does this too. Read in correct time order both books lose something. Lermontov is considered Russia's best poet after Pushkin. It shows through in the novel as it does in James Dickey's Deliverance. Enjoy them all!"
3,Don't read this translation!,"The first great of Russian prose is also translated by one of the great writers of the 20th century. Don't bother with this translation! Find the one by Nabokov. It's the tiny differences that count, and the book is worth buying just for Nabokov's introduction and notes.As for the book itself, Taman ..., but the other four stories are wonderful, especially Princess Mary and The Fatalist. Anyone with a little Romantic spirit can't help but be entranced by Pechorin. Other than Stendhal, no one else covered this ground in a novel nearly as well as Lermontov."
3,A classic of Russian early realism,"""A Hero of Our Time"" is widely held to be a crucial text in the development of the Russian nineteenth century novel, up to Turgenev and Dostoeyvsky. The hero of the title, an enigmatical figure called Pechorin, seems calculated by Lermontov to reflect the characteristics of the typical young aristocrats of his generation. He is cynical, but very heroic, possessed of reserves of willpower, but, at the same time, vulnerable -- a patently Byronic rebel with his egoism, his aloofness, his restlessness. However, it is the author Lermontov presented under the thinnest of disguises (Lermontov himself died young, in a duel in true Romantic fashion). The novel is divided into several stories, with a tenuous thread of connection running through them, dealing with the themes of friendship, love and predestination. The best sections are the first and final story, ""Vulich"", which is a clever tale about fate. The prose, however, is rather rocky (or is it the translation?)"
1,"UTTER NONSENSE, THE AUTHOR WAS A SOT","I couldn't understand a word of this. This is as unintelligible as something by Joyce or Dickens. The author needed to take ENGLISH AND GRAMMAR 101 again. It appears he failed the first time. Take my advice: if you are looking for someone with a mastery of an English language that you can understand, read Emile Gaboriau."
2,Kindle Edition Issues,"This review is not about the book itself but about the Kindle edition. The formatting on this edition is incredibly bad. I downloaded it 10 minutes earlier and I can't say I am a fan.As for the story, I'll read and judge.The Bolitho adventure is winding down for Richard and soon Adam will take center stage, I know that much. While Lewrie may start to get tired and wear on my nerves, Bolitho's introspection and self doubt kept him real."
3,"Solid entry, but riddled with historical inaccuracies","Unlike some reviewers, the more we get of personality development in the Bolitho series, the more I have come to enjoy it. There's definitely less sea action, but I don't miss it when I'm dished up such interesting characters. The only problem I had reading this entry in the series was the numerous egregious historical inaccuracies. I've been annoyed by many small errors in previous Bolitho books, but this time I was stunned by Kent's disregard for well-known facts, particularly with respect to the Peninsular War which is going on simultaneous to the action of this book. I suppose many readers neither know nor care about such things, but I am always dismayed at being jolted out of an otherwise coherent and fascinating fictional world by simply stupid errors like we see here. (These errors carry over into subsequent books of the series.)"
4,Kent's Books are always good,"It' some time ago since I've last read one of his books, but I'm always happy do catch one. I'm only sad that it takes sooo long till there is an other Bolitho on the market. There is only one better in writing narval fiction who is C. S. Forester with Horatio Hornblower."
1,Alexander Kent???,"I have read & reread the entire series & this book is the worst of the lot! He had so much he could have followed up on, tying up loose ends, embellishing characters & end it if that is his wish... But, this does NONE of those things & reads more like an apprentice that hadn't even bothered to read the preceding stories or relevant history, penned it an an afterthought. it started out well but, rapidly deteriorated into irrelevance!"
3,COME ON....,"I AM A HUGE FAN OF LUCKY, BUT HONESTLY HE COULD HAVE HAD BETTER TRACKS ON HERE FOR REAL...AND WAY MORE DOWN SOUTH FEATURES FOR THE TITLE OF THE ALBUM. PRODUCTIONZ WAS LIKE A 6 OUTTA 10, FLOWZ WERE GOOD, BUT THE FEATURES WERE LACKING. SO HE NEED TO WORK ON SOME MORE PEOPLE TO WORK WITH. GET BACK WITH HAPPY PEREZ, DFO, AND MARIO AYALA. MAKE A PLATINUM ALBUM."
5,Flared Whisky Decanter,This was a gift to my brother inlaw - He was really pleased with it and liked the design.
2,Beware the author is a proven SKEPTIC of Nostradamus,Go to Google and look up Nostradamus and Lemesurier in the Groups section of Google.There you will see the public statements of the author.He is a devout Nostradamus skeptic and a well known disinfo agent.Next to James Randi he has done more to harm the proven abilities of Nostradamus than any other.BEWARE of anything by Peter Lemesurier.Many have accused him of plagarism and most Nostradamian scholars scoff at his work.BEWARE
5,The best book!,"I used to really dislike Drew Barrymore. ( no offence if u DO read this) i was being forced to read a biography for my lang. arts class so i picked drew cuz she was the only 1 who seemed at least worth reading bout. i dont really want to read bout someone old dead guy. so i started liking her when i started not likeing Adam Sandler as much as i used to cuz thats really the only reason i hated her cuz she was always with adam. i mean now that im not screwed up with adam i c she wasnt always with him @ all. so i started reading it and in so many ways i wanted to b friends with her and help her. but not get high with her. :) its so awesome! now i want to buy it. if i had any advice to give, everyone who thinks their live is bad, read this book. evn if u dont everyone should read this. well i gtg bye this wonderful book bye! Carissa!"
5,This is the BEST book ever written!!!,"This book was AWESOME!!! Drew describes her feelings so well you feel like you went through it with her. When I finished reading this book I felt like I was her best friend. I stayed up all night reading this book. It was the best book I've ever read in my life! I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I recommend this book to everyone, especially teens."
5,Life IS stranger then fiction,"They say that money can't buy happiness, and Drew Barrymore proves it. This is one of the most heart-rending books I've ever read.Drew shows wisdom beyond her years as she invites the reader to look at her relationship with her mother, her non-relationship with her father, and her desent into drink and drugs. Follow Drew's sad real life drama as she goe's into and back out of rehab. What was the backlash on her career? Her relationships with her 'friends'? Her suicide attempt?This book is so good I had to buy copies for my friends. I just couldn't believe she wrote 'Little Girl Lost' when she was just 14 years old. Honestly, just trust me me and buy a copy. This book will give you the courage to face up to lifes trials."
5,The book was great!!!!!,If you are a teen you should read it!! I love it!! Her tale was really touching and everyone should read it!! She is better know and she is a great actress! So this young actress has grown and she is a great example!
4,Good pick!,"I am a fan of Drew, and the book really gives interesting insight into the courses of her life. It is mostly written by Drew herself, but there are also inputs of those who knew her and her loved ones. However, I feel bad for her for the drug addiction aspect of her story, but if you read the book, it really isn't anything too special, Unfortunately. There are many kids everyday everywhere in millions that succumb to the same behaviors and problems she does and worse. It really is too bad, but I wouldn't call it an outrageous hollywood story."
4,Good info,"Drew's Life is totally different now that she's an adult, but this was still an enjoyment to read for the avid Drew Barrymore fan. It shows a lot of where she's come from and was well writen. It would be cool if she'd write an update."
4,"Excellent, but sad book","Very interesting book. It took courage for Drew to tell the world about what she went through. At first I found the format distracting (flipping back and forth between Drew's writing and Todd Gold's writing), but I became used to it after a few chapters. Even though this book was very interesting, it was also terribly sad. Drew really had a rough life, some of it was of her own doing, but much of it was due to lack of guidance from adults and a predisposition to addiction acquired from her ancestors. I am happy that Drew is successful and seems to have things together now. She certainly had a rough childhood, so I hope she can find great happiness as an adult. In summary, a fascinating and sad story."
1,Not impressed with The Vitamin Shoppe,"My original order was Primadophilus for kids orange and cherry flavor. The vitamin Shoppe's standard shipping was 99cents. It took a couple of weeks to finally receive my order and it was only the orange flavor. On my receipt from the seller in said that the cherry was on back order and I saw that they doubled my shipping rate to $1.98 when it was supposed to be 99cents. When I emailed them twice about the shipping they ignored me both times and I also cancelled the back ordered item with the seller but still received it in the mail a few weeks later and still no comment from the seller. I know it is only 99cents but it is the principal of it and I don't trust ""The vitamin shoppe"". Plus when you cancel a back order item doesn't that mean for the seller to 'cancel it'! I will never order from them again."
5,"""Bone Apetit""","Angelo Moore is probably the most entertaining frontman since Dr. funkenstein himself. His spoken word is hilarious & thought provoking, though not as easily digestible as his music with Fishbone. Some will be put off by the raw recording & raw emotion presented here, but make no mistake his genius is evident. Here you witness the DNA of Fishbone eclectic emotional backdrop. Would recomend to only the real Fishbone fans."
3,little disappointed,"Since I love georgette heyer and some reviews said best regency ever, I guess I was expecting more. But it was an enjoyable regency"
4,Great Introduction to Ecuador,"Having spent almost 10 months travelling in Ecuador, I can say that this guide is extremely useful. While it doesn't have great recommendations about hotels, restaurants, transportation, etc., it definitely provides much needed background information and has incredible pictures. The maps are usually very good, but occasionally there are some mistakes. The culture sections--on food and customs-- are interesting and pertinent. Included are section about the Galapagos Islands and Amazonia. Although this guide is very informative, it is best used in conjunction with another guide that gives more specifics about dining, accomidations, shopping, etc. You should definitely read it BEFORE travelling; you will arrive in Ecuador informed and ready for an adventure."
4,If You`re Going to Ecuador...,"This book was very informative not only on the culture itself, but on the history behind the country and the people. I found this book very helpful in learning more about the country. Although it isn`t very informative as the Fodor`s travel books or other travel guides, it gives a great overview of the entire country. My only complaint is some of the wording in the book--it tended to be sarcastic at times."
2,a glossy no-starter,"A glossy book, tourist-type pictures, little practical information, and very limited sicussion of the Galapagos"
5,BarbR,"Threw out all my other top & base coats when I tried this. It's the best I've ever tried. I used to blame my chipped nail polish on the polish, but it was my old top coat. My polish lasts 2 weeks, would probably last longer, but I get bored with the color and like to change every week or two."
2,Salsa Chip,"I am sorry to say, I hate purchasing OUT OF DATE products. Especially when it comes from a FRESH CHIP. Sorry, but the chips were so stale, I threw all the bags out to the garbage. THEY SUCKED. Now, don't ask me to write something nice and lie about it. Sorry. DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER"
3,"Good, not great","First, I would like to state that the free shipping was very fast, it took about 3 days to arrive.The chips weren't as flavorful as I was hoping. The spices are pretty mild and lacked kick. It was a generic southwest flavor. It was hard to distinguish the avacado. After the reviews, I was expecting better. They are still good chips, but I wouldn't have bought a 12 case of them if I tried them before.Kudos for fast shipping, ho hum on the chips."
4,"Good chips, great value","Very good value from Amazon and a very addicting taste. Good chips to get if you don't want to mess with dips. The expiration date was 4 months away from purchase so no worries there. I managed to eat the entire case within one month anyhow :) A response to the single 1 star review earlier, the chips were not supposed to be cheesy like Nacho Cheese Doritos taste. These were very crispy and fresh. I may try their other popular flavor next. The only small negative was that one out of 12 of the bags had a small tear in the center bottom and leaked a bit and there were some crumbs inside the shipping box. The chips shipped directly from the El Sabroso factory in Los Angeles, 60 miles away."
1,Stopped working after 2 days,This will be a really short review as the unit stopped working only after 2 days. I liked it for that little while but wish it would last a bit more. It does have a nice uncluttered screen and a modern stainless steel look.This is going back to Amazon.
2,"Nice display, but....","I bought this thermometer because it had a large display and modern styling. Both of these are what I got. My complaint is that the accuracy of this thermometer around freezing is not very good. My kids have a couple weather stations I got them for last christmas and when they say 32 it is freezing out. Mine will say almost 35 even though it has clearly dipped below freezing. So if you just want a general idea of temperature with a nice large display, this is the one for you. Otherwise I would seek something more accurate."
2,Nice - But Didn't Last,"Purchased unit new in February 2009. Looks nice and worked as expected - but for less than 2 years. Replaced batteries October 2010 for winter use. Batteries in outside unit failed about three months later in January 2011. All batteries replaced with another brand. Then, after another 3 months, in April 2011, batteries in outside unit again fail. Too expensive and troublesome replacing batteries every 3 months. Cost to purchase another outside transmitter is about 50% of the cost of a new unit. Had this unit worked 5 years or more, I would have been happy with it. But, failure beginning at less than 2 years is ""not"" acceptable for a product like this."
1,Be Advised!,"Be advised. Despite what Amazon states here, this product Will Not Work on a HP 111 Designjet Printer. You need a HP 82 Black Ink cartridge. Unfortunately did not find this out till after package was opened. Which negates a return. Ended up calling HP, who confirmed that yes. The 82 is the proper black cartridge.Would like to add this is why I rated this a one star. Nothing was wrong with the packaging. And as always when dealing with Amazon the product arrived promptly."
2,"Best for your printer, Worst for your pocketbook",This is a great printer and the ink cartridge system is tops - but this item is available elsewhere for much less. Amazon should do better than this.
1,Beware of Amazon's package offer,"Amazon is offering the wrong print cartridge with the HP Designjet 111. When I bought it they offered paper and a black cartridge, but they are offering a HP 10 when it takes a HP 82. This cartridge will not fit in the plotter."
1,black replacement ink cartridge for davey wigley,"Hello, I bought a black replacement ink last week and was really depending on it for finishing a contracted project which is due on monday and I just got it today thursday, that leaves me with just 3 days to finish the project and now I start plotting the machine is now telling me that I should replace my black in, which is the ink cartridge that I bought from you guys.This is not good at all, and I don't think I'll ever be purchasing another cartridge from you guys ever again as I could have spent a bit more money to buy it somewhere else and complete my project on time, instead of being stuck here with this major problem that would obviously cost me a whole lot of money, as I would not be able to delivr my plans to my clients by monday."
5,"Great printer, great supplies","This printer family is wonderful if you do a lot of printing. The printers are pretty costly, but because you can replace each color of ink separately, and replace the printing jet heads for each color separately also, you can save a lot on replacement supplies. These ink cartridges hold a *lot* of ink.By comparison, with a lot of cheap printers, if the yellow runs out, or the holes in the magenta printing jet plug, you need a whole new cyan-yellow-magenta ink-and-jet cartridge -- and the cartridges usually hold very little ink.This type of ink has excellent darkness range, from very faint gray to very high-contrast black. The color cartridges have great color range. Together, the overall color range is almost as good as a specialty ""photo"" printer, but the ink doesn't cost nearly as much. While it really looks great on fancy paper, it works well even on cheap paper..."
4,HP 10 Black Ink Cartridge,"Product arrived within the time period. The packaging was in good condition when arrived. The expiration date that HP puts on some of their ink cartridges wasn't an issue with this particular delivery. Be careful with some of these cartridges, because the dates on them can be either expired or near expired and its a hassle to use the cartridges when they are expired. Depending on the printer/plotter, the printer/plotter will continue to use expired cartridges with some additional user input."
1,Serious problems with this camera,"1. What you see in the viewfinder is not what comes out in the photo. Photos where I center the image in the viewfinder consistently come out left of center in the image.2. All of my photos are dark in the corners. Some photos look like they're framed by this darkness, with a roundish image visible in the middle.This camera is unacceptable."
3,So far I have had no problems with this camera,I have had this camera approximately a year and a half and I have used it only a few times but on the times I have used the camera my pictures came out beautifully and I had no problems with the quality of the pictures or with using the camera itself.
1,Medicocre Chinese Olympus,"I bought a used Trip 500 at Goodwill to take to the Philippines and burn up 7 rolls of film I had lying around. Picture quality is not very good, Can't shut the flash off. Flash also seems to want to go off any time other than bright sun. I wouldn't recommend this model to anybody. Had some pretty blurry pictures even running 400 speed film. Oh well, I'm out of 35mm film and have a nice Nikon digital now..."
4,Great Book about S Club 7 in Miami!,This book is all about the show. It has lots of pictures. Even summeries of all the episodes with what songs were sung. This book is perfect for anyone who loved the series. Even comes with posters!
3,Not-So-Comfortable Star Wars Bedding Set,"My 8 year old son couldn't wait for this set to arrive. He loves the design. However, the sheets are on the ""rough"" side and after sleeping with this set for about a week he didn't want it anymore. He is somewhat getting used to it now (4 weeks later). If I new about the uncomfortableness (is this a word?) I would not have purchased it."
3,"Great visuals, less than great sheet quality","The design of this Lightsaber Duel comforter/sheet set is wonderful -- nice colors and great imagery for a kid who loves Star Wars and light sabers. The comforter is decent enough, since it doesn't touch the skin, but the sheets have a high polyester content and they feel stiff and not so comfortable to have next to the skin. We won't be using the sheets and pillowcase very much. I wish makers of kids' sheet sets would remember that kids' skin is more, not less, sensitive than adults' to rough textures."
3,Great Artwork - Super Cheap Sheets,"My Son loves it and the set is typical of a bed in a bag. We use real sheets instead of the sandpaper ones that were included, but if you have a staw wars kid in your house - I reccomend buying this and a good set of twin sheets."
1,Poor Quality,Purchased this for my little star wars fan as part of his bedroom remodel. Was very excited to find this particular pattern/graphics but when it arrived was very disappointed by the quality. The sheets and pillowcase were stiff and scratchy and we only use the comforter as a bedspread and only after I washed it in fabric softener 5 or six times. Would have been a great purchase if only the quality were better. Would not recommend!
4,Star Wars Sheets and Comforter,"I am very satisfied with these sheets.My child LOVES them.Yes the sheets are alittle thin,but mine child doesn't know or care about that.Make sure you wash them and the comforter in COLD WATER ONLY! They will last longer if you do this,after a couple of washes the sheets will get alittle softer.Just remember that you are buying this for your child,not you."
2,Cute but poor quality,"I bought the Galactic Heroes version of these sheets (also made by Dan River) for my toddler b/c they look so adorable, and they are. They're vibrant. But when I first openened the package, I was disappointed to feel how uncomfortable they were.Naturally, I hoped that they would soften up after a few washes...but after 5 washes, they still felt rough. And to add insult to injury, the elastic edge on the bottom sheet started to unravel and create a 4 inch hole.I'm no expert on thread count when it comes to sheets, but I would guess that these are around 100. The weave is so loose that you can see through the sheets and it reminds me of gauze.It's a shame that they are of such poor quality b/c I really do love the pattern. I ended up just making curtains out of the sheets.."
3,Star Wars Comforter and Sheet Set,"The comforter is fantastic and my son loves it. However, the sheets are stiff and thin. My son claims it is comfortable and looks cool; however, I don't think the sheets are nice for sleeping."
2,"Nice comforter, HORRIBLE sheets",I was SO disappointed when I opened the package. The sheets are literally see through and as rough as burlap. Horrible quality material on the sheets. The comforter is nice. My son loves it. I am going to end up spending more money on solid colored sheets that are softer and more comfortable. I would NEVER sleep on sheets like this and don't expect my child to. SO SAD because my son loves star wars so much. SHAME on whoever would manufacture such an uncomfortable product for children! I have yet to wash the comforter...I am afraid to. I DO NOT recommend this set to anyone unless you have another use for the sheets. It is not worth $60 by any means!
1,Not very durable or comfy!,I ordered this set for my son. The fabric felt rough. EVen after washing it a few times it never softened up. The fitted sheet also tore in the corner about a 4 inch tear when I was making the bed. Do not buy!
1,"Looks Great, Feels Lousy","The comforter has great colors and the lightsaber duel looks excellent. However, as many of the other reviewers noted, the materials used are lousy. As parents, we want things our children love, but we want them to be comfortable. These sheets are definitely not warm, cozy, and comfortable. I would prefer to pay a little extra for quality and comfort for my kids."
3,Pass,This item was purchased as gift for needy child per his request for Star Wars Bedding. Due to the poor quality I would not purchase this item for my family or recommend it for yours.
1,Star Wars Bedding,"Very cheaply made! The sheets are stiff & thin. I even washed them to see if they would soften up, but NO! I bought them because my son insisted on Star Wars. Otherwise, I would have sent them back. I will find other sheets to go with the comforter. The comforter isn't all the great either. Looks nice, but poorly made as well. If you child wants Star Wars, go to Sears or K-mart. They probably have better stuff."
1,cheap fabric,"I was very dissapointed with this product. It looked great until it got washed. Even though I followed the washing instructions the beautiful vibrant colors still faded away with the first wash. Amazon's service is excellent, the product was cheap and not worth the price."
3,Was definitely a hit with my son!!,"My 4 year old son is obsessed with Star Wars, so he loved the comforter!! The only complaint i have is with the sheets. They are not soft at all!! They are actually kind of scratchy. I find it uncomfortable to lay in them. But I guess he really doesn't care, because he now sleeps in his own bed all night long!!! I would recommend these for a young kid. If they are into Star Wars, they will love the comforter set!!"
5,A gold mine of enterprise application frameworks,"This book helps you to reduce the cost of framework development by providing 40 case studies, documenting the experiences framework builders and users at major corporations and research labs, world-wide. Throughout, the authors extract important lessons and highlight technical and organizational implementation practices that have been proven to yield the biggest pay off.This is why I choose this book."
5,Very well done indeed,"This book is a model for a relatively concise but thorough biography of an under-appreciated historical figure. The writing is skillful, and the text benefits immensely from extensive quotations from Wright's voluminous letters. Wright's voice is lively and witty and she makes very good company for the 7 or 8 hours required to read this book.In the eyes of history, Wright has been overshadowed by her older sister Lucretia Mott and her contemporaries Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. But her central participation in both the woman's rights and anti-slavery causes secures her a place as one of the giants of the mid-19th century. Wright believed strongly in the benefits of free expression and complete tolerance even of shocking views expressed by others. She thus anticipated many intellectual currents of the late 20th century.This book is very much worth reading."
4,Courage and Grace,"Fred Craver gave the reader the gracious gift of the story of his life filled with pain as well as renewal. Reading his book was like listening to a song. He went back and forth from pain to awareness. In this manner he found a pathway towards healing. His book is kind, and startling, raw and soothing."
3,Works great... for the first six months,"About a year ago I bought and installed four of these and I was thrilled with the even coverage (and the almost hypnotic stream motion). However, after about half a year, within a month of each other, the locking rings on two of the sprinklers developed splits causing water to gush out. After replacing them, a third sprinkler stopped rotating. I discovered that it will begin rotating again if I increase the spray radius from 15 feet to about 18 feet. For me, this causes a lot of water to go where I don't want it. So I give this three stars because it works beautifully when brand new, but seems to degrade rather quickly."
3,Toro 30-Foot MultiStream Adjustable Underground Sprinkler Rotor,Was disappointed that I could not use it. I did not have enough water pressure in my system to drive this particular sprinkler head. I have what I would consider medium water pressure.
1,Terrible,"The only good thing about this show is her crazy, schizo., friend'srole. But the rest is awful. I don't like Courtney Cox in this role at all. I won't be buying a second season...I cannot believe there will be a second season.Tokyo"
4,"betrayal, relationships, broken people","""Don, we never do what I want to do."" Here's another fine cable series to help us cope with the madness of our predicament here on planet earth.Some of the characters are a bit flat. But the writers have created so many fascinating moments I don't want to give it less than four stars.I completely agree with other reviewer that Don the pap is the real star of the series. His scenes tend to have the juice. He's played by a British actor with an impeccable American accent.The person who said that Holt McLaren's character is Tom Cruise-like is wrong. Holt is Sean Penn. Who else could he be?"
1,Please not another season of this!,Ok so I have always thought Courteney Cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it. It really is the most boring show Ive seen in a long time. If you thought she was bad in scream...and friends..dont watch this...there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it. Hopefully this show will be scraped.
2,Bunny boo hoo,"I bought this film around Easter for some yuks with friends.The cover photo, and trailer looked promising, BUT it was more a sad tragedythan a funny bunny comedy. There are some dark funny moments, butoverall its a long sad film about unemployed Easter bunnies, who failto find anything else they can do to make a living. Bunny boo hoo"
1,Really not sure if I liked it or not!,"This is definately a one-of-a-kind flick and I'm not sure if I really liked it. It had its moments (a few), but the relationship between Hank and Mike is really strange...not gay at all...they have their share of pretty women...but very strange. The humor was subtle...not something you would laugh out loud about. I guess the reason I gave it 1 star is that these two clowns wear their rabbit costumes throughout the entire film, even after they are fired from their jobs as Easter Bunnies. The plot is thin, the acting is thin, and the humor is marginal. Maybe this would be funny to the younger generation, but it just didn't have the fun or life I expected. 1 star...nothing more."
3,Sorry for them,"Sorry, I did not consume this low-budget stuff properly, perhaps.If there was humour there, it is really not in murdering a manager by throwing him from the skyscraper window down.The bunnies are so lazy they did not take off suits going sleep and making love.Movie is as nice as the lowest price of $0.44 indicates."
1,Very disappointing,"I bought this tape, expecting that a tape destined for seniors will be done with the utmost care and precision. Instead, I got a medley of short workouts, all suffering from bad cuing and too much talk. I tried to go through the aerobic and strength training, but it was unpleasant, boring and with too long intervals in between, not to mention the lack of coordination between the 2 participants and the awful setting.I did not try out the Pilates , but I did the Yaga dance, which was kind of strange.I am 65 and have been exercising for the last 8 years. I prefer the Prevention tapes and other beginner-intermediate workouts which enable different degrees of excertion for those days on which seniors may need less demanding workouts. I want to warn all prospective buyers: it sounds like a good bargain to have all the different workouts in one package, but it is a great disappointment."
5,A Must-Read,"This book is a must-read for anyone who is concerned about the direction in which our society is headed, and especially if you have children. I was amazed at how far-reaching the ACLU's influence has been, and will continue to be if not stopped."
5,Beyond Important Print,"This writing is bone chilling...rife with fact and reference. The ACLU is exposed indicting it's own self with it's own words within it's own doctrine, using it's own history. The way Alan Sears and Craig Osten present their outstanding research of the ACLU and it's interference with American culture promotes an incredible discussion. I have purchased many copys of this book over the many years it has been in print...each of them I gave away. Each of them put to good use. Amazingly this book is difficult to find in big book stores such as Borders and Hastings...they had it...but it was located in places that were...ummm...amazing."
4,Exposes the ACLU for what it is,"This book is aptly titled and does a fantastic job of exposing the ACLU for what it is. The quotes from ACLU representatives alone are priceless! They really condemn themselves. The director of the Louisiana ACLU recently compared school board members in Tangipahoa Parish who open meetings with prayer to the terrorists who bombarded the Twin Towers on 9/11. That's consistent with the stuff I've read in this book. I was amazed at the numerous ways in which the ACLU is trying to tear down America while wrapping itself in the flag. Lots of footnotes, and well documented, this book is an eye-opener and a great resource."
1,The real agenda,"The real agenda here is not of the ACLU, but of the writers, to impose their viewpoints on how we all should believe and behave. The book is an attack, not an argument. The writers say, among many other things, that children will no longer have the fond memories their elders have of school at Christmas time. Why should a lack of songs that purportedly teach me the ""true meaning of Christmas"" (p. 170, paperback edition) mean that the winter holiday season will be ""cold and impersonal""? Perhaps, rather, this time of year will be more inclusive without making those of us who do not celebrate Christmas feel like outcasts. All this book is a piece of promotional writing for the organization, the Alliance Defense Fund, ""dedicated to defend [sic] and protect [sic] the right to hear and speak the Truth"" (back cover). Note the capital T in Truth. Whose truth? Not mine."
2,Extreme right wing point of view,This book has some very good points in it if you can get past the extreme right wing religous agenda.
1,... or less...,"In a word, theocratic* agitprop** from a neo-fascist*** powermonger.* The belief in government by divine guidance.** agitational propaganda (QV).*** An adherent of ... right-wing authoritarian views."
5,Video,"[...]This item was sold by Amazon as ""minor blemish"". The blemish was marked with easily removable sticker. Blemish no big deal.. that seagull I nicked has a bigger blemish, LOL and just kidding.. no birds injured yet. Why do they love dive bombing with the Kite? Kinda like dolphins and ships at sea I guess.I purchase the last on Amazon had..Thanks Amazon, and Prism!"
5,Timeless appeal.,I loved these songs as a child. My children loved them too. I think their appeal is timeless.
2,Not Exactly Our Idea of Enjoyable Listening,"Always looking for music that our two-year old and we will enjoy, we thought that this Woody Gutherie might be it. I should have listened to the previews! Not for us, or as Chloe said, ""BAD!"" Repetitive, nasal-twang songs with no zip or much melody. I know Woody Guthrie is one of the greats, but this CD doesn't show us why."
1,You will not be shipped this item,"Customer service was excellent, I received a refund. However, the item that you will receive will not be this item. There is a labeling error from somewhere and you will get an ear bud. I tried ordering from three vendors and each time I received an item with a similar model number (HFLX-SAM225). Be ware."
5,Digi-Code Garage Door Control,"This product worked very well, it was easy to program to my quite old garage door opener code, and has good range and clipped easily to the visor of my car."
4,Very good!,"The product arrived on time, it's of great quality and at a very good price! I'm very satisfied!"
5,Digi-Code 5012 Garage Door Opener Transmitter,Great garage door opener. So easy to program. Much easier to use then my old one that came with my garage door. Was very reasonable priced. Would definitely refer to a friend.
5,Need a Copy,"It's Great!!! I'm An independant DJ and lost my copy of this one. Anyone have a lead on this. Please call 303-338-5441 Denver , CO USA"
3,Not worth the time,I can get it for same price at Wal-Mart or even cheaper at the end of the season. This is not one of the things that is a better deal on line.
1,Killed three of my plants within 72 hours - do not recommend,"I was drawn to using Osmocote branded outdoor/indoor release plant food since they had a $10 rebate but unfortunately, all three of my plants that received smaller quantities of the capsules(food) died within 72 hours of feeding.These plants were about a year older and healthy. I used only the amount that was recommended on the label and yet the plants died..Do not recommend this product!!!"
1,a terrible product.,"To start you don't get what the picture shows. Second when you actually open it, it looks cheap and bad finished. It's NOT a Sony product!!! I don't even what to plug my psp to it. I really don't recomend it and read carefully what it is cause you would be disapointed as I'm."
4,Good deal,"I decided to buy this assortment of cable ties after looking at several different options on Amazon. I liked the different colors and lengths, I liked that the set came with 200 ties, and I liked that it was relatively inexpensive (a little over $6.00 for 200 ties).After opening the package, I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more variation in the lengths of ties. I would have liked some ties that were longer than the orange/white/black ones but a little shorter than the very long black ones. But all in all, this was a very worthwhile purchase, and this is a great deal. The ties are easy to use and are sturdy. I've used them to tie up a lot of extra cables in the house, as well as to organize cables behind my tv/surround sound system.Definitely worth purchasing if you need ties."
5,great and easy!!,This product is a life saver i used it too tie up all my computer cords so it doesnt look like a tangled mess back there. And for the price you get tons of different sizes and colors its great!!!
2,not great,"im not thrilled with these. there dont seem to be enough in the tube thing, and the largest size is not very large.also, they are not adjustable-- there is no 'flip' thing in the plastic that would allow them to be un-cinched"
4,For Collectors of Sorayama,"This is simply a collection of Hajime Sorayama's work. High quality postcards. Would be a shame to actually post one. Missing from the card, is a title to the painting. If you want to frame these, I think that could work. This is more for the collector. I received exactly what I wanted. -Kevin"
5,what a bargain,"great price great product, would recommend this product to anyone, quick service and heaps cheaper than any retailers in my area"
2,lost sleeve,"Generally speaking, fluke products are surperb. But these, although made well, didn't perform as well as other clips I have. Inside, where you slip the probe tips into, there's a little sleeve. The sleeve will slide out unexpectedly, and get stuck on the probe. On mine, this happened, I didn't realize it, then found one side to be suddenly loose. I continued using the other side, until the same happened, and I noticed the sleeve stuck on the probe. After, the sleeve refused to stay in the clip. So, I switched the whole setup to removeable probe tips, so now the clips I use slide on in place of the probes. This makes available several different tips, such as what you would find in test lead kits available everywhere including fluke."
2,CLOSE BUT NO SOUP FOR YOU!,"The Pyle guys had a good idea, but left a few things out. Unit broadcasts audio to radio using an even frequency, Most vehicle radio recievers are on odd frequnecy. So we could not get reception on the radio and had to purchase exterior speaker. THEY NEED SEVERAL FREQUENCIES TO BROADCAST TO.The first unit they sent me would not recgonize the DVD, it took TWO weeks to get a return authorization, had to pay $70.00 to overnight new unit, which arrived late, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! NEW UNIT LOCKS UP AFTER IT HEATS UP, I have to cycle unit off and wait to cool.BE AWARE!!!!!!!!"
1,The Missions of California,"I was looking forward to sharing this video with my 4th grade classroom. Visually, the photos, both historic and current, are wonderful. The narrator of this video speaks very, very quickly, and it's difficult to follow the ton of information he is spouting constantly! I would not recommend this video."
5,Changed the way I think about high availability,"This book is a must read for anybody building safety-critical systems. It totally convinced me that we need to move from a ""detect and failover"" strategy to a ""replicate and isolate"" strategy to achieve unprecedented levels of availability in a very affordable and cost effective way. This book is making my life easier and improving the way our company does business. What more could you ask for?"
4,Good Book - Poor Grammar,"This book (and most others in the Heroes of History series)is chock full of good information and reads easily in a child-friendly format. There are some ""dry"" areas, but history can be rather dry at times. My greatest concern is the improper grammar that is scattered liberally throughout every book in the series that I have read. I would prefer to give this book 3 1/2 stars."
4,A Great Place to Start,I feel like this book gave me more professional training than a lot of the other books that I have read (This book has been used in a lot of cosmetology schools) I had already watched the video about 4 times before I bought the book. I don't know if the book would be confusing if you hadn't watched the video beforehand. I feel that between the book and the video this was a great place for me to start learning haircutting! The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that I feel it could have given us a lot more information on each page - the book didn't have to be that basic!
1,Not one of the better,"Not one of the better books out there... I should have sent it back, but I did not, I will donate it to the beauty school when I leave and get a tax credit I guess. disappointing, did not learn anything that was not in the standard already, you are better off observing than trying to understand this mess."
3,out-dated,"Of course the techniques still work, but the styles are definitely out-dated. It was written in the eighties."
4,haircutting basics,"i ordered this product for a gift list, and the recipient recieved it from another customer... the book was returned to Amazon and I have nor recieved credit for the order, I may have returned it under the wrong reason for shipping it back,agnes Capeci."
4,Accessible and Fluid,"This is probably the best grammar of Old English in current circulation (unless you can somehow get your hands on a copy of Bright's). Don't waste your time trying to find another one. It clearly arranges each section and provides a preface/introduction to each element of grammar. My only complaint would be its limited dictionary, but Clark & Hall have published a decent student dictionary for Old English."
4,Engrossing and at times sad view of Vietnamese gangs,Every American immigrant group has had its share of gangs that preyed upon new arrivals for their own interests. Asian immigrants have fared a lot worse in their history because they truly have needed their tongs to defend them from some of the worse elements of discrimination and a cultural distrust of government and law enforcement.T.J. English shows how BTK filled in this gap and exploited all elements of fear and cultural misunderstanding to tell the story of how BTK was so successful for the time it existed. He gives his usual sharp sociological view of criminology which makes the stories all the more compelling. He also explains why the gang life was so compelling to criminals while not excusing their behavior. This is a well written and enjoyable work!
3,True Crime,"This book, like many true crime books, is more a sociological tome than an entertaining read. English describes the people and crimes involved in the grand American tradition of immigrant criminal gangs.It is always interesting to be reminded how displaced kids with little percieved opportunity band together in their own societies with their own rules and how the collision of those societies with mainstream society, hurts both the victims of the criminal gangs and the criminals themselves.I would recommend the book for a good insight into the recurring theme of immigrant crime in America."
4,Born to Kill,"Interresting, but it get tedious with the details. However the research seems first class and the inside information gives us a good ubderstanding on how things got from bad to worse. If you are interrested in reality crime this is good"
3,Great! but be prepared to fix it...,"Works great, but when it came I had to re-bend it into working shape. Shouldn't have to do that."
3,Not for big clunky earrings...,"The other reviewer is right...you can only fit a limited amount of the big dangly hoopy earrings. More suitable for small ones such as studs. The holes are very close together, so you have to sort of skip a few to hang the next ones. It's sturdy, just don't be fooled by the pic, where it looks like you can fit a ton of earrings. =)"
2,not for me!,"the product arrived and the bottom ring was broken or bent. the columns are too close together and doesn't give adequate room in between for long earrings. It is great if you have a lot of small, short length earrings. allows for lots of them to be placed on the rack."
5,very nice.,"i decided to get some type of a jewelry tree when my old case was no longer capable of holding all my jewelry, so i went with this one. NOT dissapointed, has TONS of room to hold all types of earrings. i have dangly, studs, and hoop earrings hanging from mine and you can even hang a bracelett or 2 from the top swirls, but its too short to hold any necklaces, but thats alright with me i keep them separate. very nice looking can sit on top of a dresser or counter, not too big more on the medium scale of thing, and seems to be durable so far."
5,"Great gift for mom, now I want one!","My mom had asked for something to hold her jewelery in, and I thought this would be space efficient and pretty. It came already assembled and ready to go! My mom really liked it and it looks great with all the earrings, bracelets, and necklaces on it. Really good price too - I think I might have to get one for myself!"
4,this is awesome,"Has more than a hundred earring holding holes, its simply brilliant! I had been looking for a jewellery stand since a long time and unable to find something in the store which met my needs, I turned to Amazon. I wish I had looked here earlier. The product's quality is good, the paint is not worn off or something. The only reason I did not give it one extra star is because after holding my necklaces on both the sides, there's not enough space left for my bracelets, but that's okay. I was looking exclusively for a earring holder anyway."
4,"Solid, Sturdy Earring Holder","Bought this for my wife for Christmas. It's heavy, wrought iron. It's fairly big, and can hold a lot of earrings. It's base is very sturdy, and it won't tip over, which is what I was somewhat concerned about. The loops at the top can hold necklaces and such. I give it a 4 star because I wish it had more room for necklaces. But, I've seen a similar style-design with lots of stowage for necklaces, but it has a much larger footprint - I think I saw it on Amazon. My wife likes it, though, nuff said."
5,Great earring holder!,this product is very pretty and very useful too. It arrived quickly and I'm very pleased with it.
5,Fanastic earring holder,"I bought this earring tree several years ago and have been happy with it ever since. When I first bought it, I had read a review that suggested that one should cut the third and the sixth rung off of it to allow it to hold longer earring styles. I cut off the third rung with a little hack saw and will eventually cut off the sixth. It is perfect! Once I got this holder, I loved it so much I started really getting into buying earrings to help fill it up. Now I have a beautiful collection all neatly organized and nicely displayed. This is a great product."
3,Its alot bigger than you may think....,"This thing is cute dont get me wrong, but its a lot bigger than what i saw on the web. but its cute decoration, and another bummer is that is has odd numbers of holes so the earing dont match up with every hole."
5,Looks great,"Stand is very nice and doesn't have any balace problems. Holds plenty of earings, bracelets, and necklaces and keeps them visible."
4,Good quality,This earring holder is cute and practical. It seems really sturdy and displays jewelry nicely. The only thing that I would point out is that it doesn't really hold too many earrings. I where longer dangly stuff and I could only fit about 30 pair on there and they overlap each other.
4,product does the job,Earring holder holds around 80 pairs of earrings which is just what my mom needed for all her earrings. The only thing I would change about this holder would be to alter the distance between each row to accommodate different length earrings. But my mom is using it right now and loves it.
4,Does what is is made to do.,"I bought this to hang all of my earrings. It works fine. The holes could be a little further apart as I had to skip a hole between some of my larger earrings. Looks great in my closet and appears to be sturdy so far, even completely full."
2,Poor construction,"I returned this because the horizontal bars were not all straight, some of the earring holes were off center, and the horizontal bar connections to the frame were not flush. It may have just been that I got a defect."
5,Pretty and functional,I really like this earring display harp. Doesn't take up much space and saves me time in the morning...no more searching for the other earring! :) I would recommend this product to a friend.
5,Didn't know I needed this,"I was focused on a necklace holder and would not have considered the earring rack had it not been offered as a package deal. I am so glad it was! Now the tiny studs are in plain sight, not hiding in a tangle of necklaces. No more putting in one earring and not being able to find its match. If you love organization and efficiency, you need this!"
4,Does the Job Nicely,I have several jewelry armoires and two jewelry boxes. I could never keep track of all my earrings. This sits on my dresser sideways so that it does not take up a lot of space. I can see my earring selections at a glance and they are not tangled and separated. Great solution to my earring problem. I can now enjoy more of them without searching through the menagerie - esp. when I am in a hurry.
3,It's huge!,This thing is massive. Maybe I should have expected that but it was a lot bigger than I anticipated. Will have to reorganize my dresser top to use.
2,"Bormioli Rocco Frigoverre Jug with Hermetic Lid, 2-Liters","When I unpacked this pitcher I was pleased with the look of it. That all changed when I filled it with tea. It is quite heavy and the handle is on the small side. The lid fits and seals as advertised. The thing I detest most about this pitcher is that while pouring and after you stop pouring, it runs down the outside of the pitcher. The only defense is to hold a paper towel under the pouring lip to catch the leaking fluid.I would not recommend this pitcher."
2,Lid too loose,The shape is good. Easy to store but the Lid is too loose. Had to hold the lid when pouring liquid
4,Better than plastic,"I got this to replace my old plastic pitcher. I am happy I did. The handle is good for my petite hands. The lid seals tight. I have no problem opening it. It is a bit heavy, especially when full. And the pour spout could be more defined. It dribbles a bit down the front when poured. But I like it overall."
3,Has plastic top and it doesnt fit too tight.,"I bought this to stay away from plastic!!! But the lid is plastic :/ and it appears not to seal as tightly as I want it too but it does seal without drips. I wouldnt say its air tight, but I havent tested it's ablility to hold air."
2,Didn't love it,"I'll keep this short. I'm a grown man with grown man hands, and this handle was very tight against the base and short. Very uncomfortable to pour when full. You can't pour with the lid on. Liquid frequently ran down the side of the pitcher when it did pour due to the infinitesimal spout. And mine cracked within two days of putting tea into it to cool down in the fridge. I left the tea out for a good hour after it came to boil, so the liquid was warm but not excessively so. My cheap crappy $1 store pitchers can take it. But not this.I bought this pitcher to look nicer in my fridge for company, but nothing about this pitcher was fun for me. It's bulk in my fridge for it's size, tough to pour, and cracked where far cheaper pitchers held up. It is pretty though."
5,Functional and worth buying!,"I purchased this as part of my resolution to reduce the amount of plastic my food/beverages are stored within. Purchased 3 different glass pitchers for the fridge... functional benchmark would be volume of 2 liters and tight enough seal to shake juice concentrates. Of the three, this is the clear winner... it was the least expensive and most functional. I did not experience any of the problems with the lid that others have noticed... my only wish is that this was available in cobalt or another light inhibiting color/opaqueness. If you have children in the house, be aware that this is real glass and thick to boot... so fairly heavy."
4,Worth it,Pros:GlassMade in ItalyFits in the fridge doorCons:Lid must be removed to pour. A few times people have tried to pour with the lid on and it hasn't ended well.The space between the handle and container is pretty narrow. By doing this It fit's nicely in the door and doesn'ttake too much space. By doing this I can't wrap my hands all the way around the handle...Over all I'm happy with it.
4,Almost Great,"I make tea for the family by the gallon to put in the refrigerator and glass is the best for cold storage. When I ordered this pitcher I really wanted a gallon size but none are available on Amazon or elsewhere that I have found. So I bought two of these pitchers. So far it has worked out for the smaller size is easier to manage and fit into the refrig. The pitchers are not heat rated to pour boiling water into but a few minutes on the counter for steeping the tea seems to be enough. I would still like to have a gallon size that is heat treated, hence the 4 star rating."
4,Seal-able Glass Jug,This is a great thing to have if you need a glass pitcher with a lid that makes a good seal. There is a little handle in the middle of the lid which when turned expands the ring sealing the lid.
3,Still not quite it,"What's good about this pitcher:Holds quite a bit of liquid.It's heavy glass and the liddoes fit the mouth, althoughI always remove it when pouring.What I don't like about it:It is really heavy with liquid in it.While I can hold onto the handle I agreewith other reviewer that it's a strangelyshort handle, but probably would work formost people.The spout is NOT well designed for pouring.I find with this spout, you are better offpouring fast and purposely because otherwiseit will dribble. And/or get the glass rightunder the lip of the spout to try and avoidthe spillage. I think the spout needs to bemore defined or something."
2,Not good,"I bought this pitcher at William & Sonoma because it was glass and had a top. I wanted to be able to shake up lemonade before pouring. The top (at least on the one they sold at William & Sonoma) does not do a good job of keeping in liquid. What's worse, the pitcher's tiny spout makes it very difficult to pour without spilling. It's hard to believe that a simple pitcher could fall so short of my expectations, but this one has done just that."
4,sturdy work horse,"I have a fear of glass pitchers. I spent 4th of July two years ago in the ER having my foot stitched up because a friend's faulty pitcher came loose at the handle, crashed on the floor and sliced my foot. This pitcher is well made all around, I feel confident using it knowing that the connection between the handle and the body of the pitcher is fused together in a sturdy fashion. I like the air tight ability of lid, I make batches of cold brewed coffee that this pitcher keeps fresh in the fridge. My only complaint is that the opening is a touch too small for me to reach inside with a sponge while cleaning, but this is not a biggie. I like owning things that perform well, don't cost an arm & leg, and will last me through the years. This pitcher fits the bill."
2,Waste of money,This pitcher was smaller than I anticipated. The handle is not a comfortable grip; it's like it is too short for the weight of the glass. The pouring spout stinks; it doesn't pour exactly where you want. The lid is a very nice feature and I wish other glass pitchers had lids like this.
1,No stars,The lid did not seal - it was a waste of money and I threw it out rather than go through the hassle of returning it. The 1 litre bottle was only slightly better.
1,"Not guaranteed to last a long time, per their claim","Mine slipped in the sink during hand washing and broke, 5 days after the one-month returnable window.Otherwise, it was a good product although a bit too heavy for my 80 year old mom to lift."
1,Was nice for the month it lasted...,After exactly one month of using this jug a bottom corner chunk of glass chipped off and now it leaks from the bottom.
3,Nice pitcher except...,Except the handle was broken upon arrival!! I guess I will review it again after I buy another one!! Was only wrapped in bubble wrap and placed inside a huge box with other items!!
2,Clumsy design,"It fulfills its basic function of a lidded, airtight glass container but the design is absolutely ridiculous. The handle is absolutely the opposite of ergonomic (unless you have tiny hands) and the lid is a marvel of opaque function. Lots of reviews discussing how impossible the lid is to operate but these folks must not be very bright. The lid is simple to operate, just non-obvious. Even so, the lid operation design is terribly overwrought. I could think of a press button mechanism that would be much simpler (probably used on some Tupperware jugs).In summary, it's a work of art in some Italian designer's eye, just not very useful."
4,If only it...,"If only the pitcher arrived in good condition. The handle was broken otherwise I would give it 5 stars. I still love it and not returning it. It's still functional as only a piece was broken off. Bummer right?! I actually love this pitcher and have already made some lemonade and put it in the frig... Also, I'm not quite sure what the fuss is about the lid; it's actually simple to use. You must hold the cap while twisting the handle clockwise."
5,Love it,"Great little pitcher. Lid does not leak when you tighten it properly. Use it for tea, lemonade and juice. I want another one."
3,Good Pitcher but could use a larger handle,"I purchased this pitcher because I was sick of leaking milk containers and lids that wouldn't easily come off. Some people have complained about the lid but I've really not had problems. It creates an air tight barrier which is quite nice. After a couple of uses, I think most people will find it natural. My only big gripe is the tight clearance between the handle and the jug. They need to redesign it. It is uncomfortable, especially with a jug full of milk."
5,Just what I wanted.,"I had a smaller glass pitcher and was looking for something larger and found this. It is perfect - just what I needed. I read the reviews where some said it was hard to seal, it really isn't, just hold and twist. I agree, if I had larger hands, I could see where there might be a problem with space between the handle and the pitcher itself, but for me it is fine."
4,What I wanted,"I was looking for a glass pitcher with lid, this fits perfectly. The lid fits airtight, which is good. But it does not allow for pooring without taking the lit off. The pitcher fits nicely in the side of refrig."
5,Lid works fine. See: User Error. See also: The Truth Hurts.,"I got the 39oz. I use it to store milk and have no issues so far, lid or otherwise. To operate the lid, you read the instructions. Fairly intuitive, but then again, I can only guess as to how a full sheet of instructions and directions on the lid would be difficult to comprehend.The only thing that would make me knock a star off on this product is that the glass isn't tempered. Still, it's fairly thick and strong--I've knocked it into my marble counter, and it's fine. To keep my milk in a safe temperature zone, I stick the jug into the fridge after washing and drying, and then fill it with milk when it gets cold."
5,exactly what i wanted!,"I wanted a large, glass pitcher to make iced tea and iced coffee. I searched all over but didn't find anything that was shock resistant. This jug had excellent reviews but someone said it broke when they put hot liquids in it. But the product description did say it was shock resistant so I ordered it. I LOVE it! When I make tea or coffee I let it cool for 5 minutes and then pour it in the pitcher. I never pour hot liquids in it if it has recently been in the fridge or is has had something cold in it. Just don't be dumb about it and it won't break. The lid is super easy to seal on. No idea what these other people are talking about. I highly recommend this pitcher. It keeps things very cold, easy to clean, and is perfect for making big batches of iced tea or coffee."
5,Nice jugs!,"Did that get men's attention?! Hahahahaa! This is just what i was looking for in a water jug to sit on my counter. We have a water filtration system which dispenses very slowly so I keep a reserve out at all times. I didn't like the look of my plastic Tupperware and wanted the cleanliness of glass. This is perfect! It holds a bit more than a 1/2 gallon. The handle seems to be a concern for some but I like its sturdy feel being close to the jar. I have large hands and it's not a problem at all. The lid is nice as well. I agree with the one person who wrote that it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out. Unless you have only one hand, you should have no problem with the hold and twist design. It seals very nicely. Being square is nice too. It will fit into a cooler or refrigerator better. I am considering buying a second one just like it. Nothing negative to say about this one!"
2,Hard to pour without spilling,"It takes some patience and care to pour with this pitcher, without ending up with some spills on the table.However, my wife seems like this pitcher (mostly because it's glass).I found that if you hold the cup on one hand, pitcher on the other, and hold the cup up so the rim is touching the the pitcher below the lip, with the pitcher touching the rim of the cup, pour slowly and lift gently when finish, then it might not spill. Oh, keep a towel ready too. :-)Oh, it's on the heavy side too especially when filled with water."
5,Glass pitcher,"It is perfect for storing ice tea and doesn't take up much space in the refrigerator. However, I broke mine by filling it with boiling water to brew the tea. It is not Pyrex."
3,I really liked it at first,"I am a wildlife rehabilitator and I mix formula every day. Eight cups of water, four cups of formula fits perfectly in this pitcher. I love it for storage and mixing and pouring although sometimes for some reason, the formula runs down the side of the container and gets all over the counter. Wrong speed of pouring, wrong temperature? Very irritating and expensive to lose any of it.The reason I only gave it three stars is that it is not microwavable. This means I have to pour it into a pyrex mixing bowl to bring to the correct temperature so an extra bowl then needs washing.Two minutes of microwave caused one of the containers half full to split perfectly around its middle and ruin 4 cups of formula. Maybe I am just stupid for assuming such perfect glass would be microwavable, it does not say it is but it does not say it isn't either."
1,Breaks at high temperatures,"I bought this pitcher 4 years ago. It worked like a dream. I tend to make hot tea and at the time on a gas stove. Little did I know that on an electric stove I would have this problem but when I make tea, the temperature is so hot that it shatters the glass. I bought another one and the same thing happened this morning. Low temps it works great, higher temps it breaks be warned."
3,Poor handle for large hands.,"I bought this jug after reading many positive reviews here. Its best two characteristics are the positive sealing lid and the decent price. The lid has a large internal O-ring that expands to seal against the jar neck when you grip the lid edge and twist the center portion. The handle is small but that aspect alone is not at issue here. The problem is that the handle is positioned too close to the side of the jug. Just for reference, my hands require Men's glove size XL. When I try to grip it as you would a normal pitcher I can almost get my fingers around the handle. When I say almost, I mean that you can easily get your knuckles pinched in between the handle and the jug. Instead, you must hold the handle with your fingertips which is not ideal, especially if it is full."
5,Best pitcher ever,This pitcher is really nice. The lid closes tight. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their liquids fresh in the fridge.
5,"It works great, but is it lead free?","This pitcher works great, but I could not find any info about it on Bormioli Rocco website. It only mentions its crystal products are lead free. Does it anyone know?"
3,Good pitcher,"This is a very good pitcher and sturdy glass construction. The lid fits well and creates a very tight seal. The only problem is that you cannot pour with the lid on. I've tried turning the locking mechanism at differnt positions with no luck. Regardless of this, with the lid off, it was still easy to pour. Would have preferred to be able to pour with the lid on."
3,"Great Pitcher, but Lid Stopped Sealing","I love the pitcher, but the lid no longer seals well. I got about two years out of it before the lid stopped sealing."
5,Really worked for us,"the cap really seals and no leaking, fits in the fridge door, ordered another one. I would recommend this one."
5,Great...ordering another...,"Initially bought the 2L pitcher for making iced tea. Found it to be the perfect size for making OJ from frozen concentrate. So, I'm back for another. I didn't have problems with drips or leaking. The handle is a little awkward but manageable. Very durable. Washes up well in dishwasher."
5,Greatest pitchers we have ever purchased,We had been looking for something to remove some of the clutter that juice containers make (seems like the kids won't drink the last few drops and leave the containers in the fridge). We also needed a container to keep our herbal tea cold and fresh. These fit the bill exactly. We love the locking tops. They keep the juice/tea fresh and don't let the liquids absorb odors from anything else that happens to be in the fridge. Easy to use. Easy to clean. Very nice looking and extremely serviceable. Just the right size.
5,Practical and fuctional design,"I bought the glass pitcher to store homemade soy milk made from theSoyajoy G3 Soy Milk Maker. I'm very impressed. It holds two batches of milk. The design allows it to fit neatly in the fridge anb it's squat so it won't tip over. The tight seal protects the milk inside. I was concerned it may be hard to clean, or that the lid would be challenging to use. Neither of these concerns turned out to be valid. The wide opening and smooth interior makes it very easy to wash. The lid is trivial to use and the seal is air-tight. This is exactly what I hoped it would be."
4,Great product,"I love this product. After breaking the first one (Completely my fault -- I poured a hot liquid into the sink with the jug after pulling it from the refrigerator. Not my smartest idea.), I didn't hesitate to purchase another. It holds a lot of liquid and the seal on the jug keeps things fresh. The only downsides I've noticed is that the handle is a bit small compared to the rest of the container and it does get a bit heavy when filled."
3,"Heavy, but durable, lid is a pain","I bought this to make sun tea. It is very compact, but does fit 2 quarts of liquid in it. The pitcher is heavy itself, and once it's full of liquid, it is verrry heavy for my wife. The lid has some type of turn and suction technology to it. It is kind of a pain to work with...sometimes it is hard to get the lid to stay on. Also, when you pour, liquid will run down the pitcher."
5,Excellent pitcher for iced tea!,"This is an excellent little pitcher. I looks quite small, but holds more liquid than you would think (due to its square-ish shape). The product description say it is a 2-liter container, but I have observed that it comfortably holds a bit more than this. The glass it quite heavy, which is a plus from my point of view as it is sturdy and holds in the coldness of iced tea better. It is machine washable. I love the air-tight lid. It is a simple design than works quite well and doesn't require threading or grooves that can be difficult to clean. I liked mine so much that I got another as a gift for my parents. They also love theirs. They especially like its square profile, which fits nicely into their cramped fridge."
2,"I loved it, until it exploded","This is not a product made to handle sudden temperature changes. The glass is not safe for making tea. I have been using it for less than one week for tea, meaning, boil water put tea bags into pitcher, with spoon, pour in water, brew. This morning doing the same thing until it exploded shattering glass and pouring 1.7 liters of boiling water into my stovetop. Well, this won't work for my purposes."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,This is so small. You can only get 3 full glasses of water out of this. Save your money and get a bigger one!
5,great pitcher,"I wanted a glass beverage pitcher to replace my stained plastic container. This one is very good. The boxy shape allows it to fit nicely on a shelf in the door of the refrigerator.Others complained that the lid is loose- which it is, but I found that turning the handle on the lid tightens the lid nicely. The rubber seal on the lid a suitable for keeping out refrigerator odors.The only drawback I find is that after pouring the liquid and returning the pitcher to the upright position the liquid does drip down the side.Overall I am pleased with this product."
2,The lid really is annoying!,"When I read the reviews for this product, I was skeptical of the people who criticized the lid. But, it really is annoying to the point that I don't use the pitcher anymore. We figured out how it works - it is tricky because you kind of have to hold the outside ring of the lid in place while you turn the inside. I don't have a problem getting a tight seal (except that it can be hard to push in), but I struggle with getting it open. I still can't figure out if you're supposed to be able to pour with the lid on (obviously after opening the spout part of it) or if the lid has to come completely off in order to pour things. It seems to work differently every time we use it. If you tend to have issues with opening things (like pickle jars), this is definitely not for you. All things considered, while I can make this pitcher work, it really shouldn't be this difficult, so I am going to get rid of it and buy a new pitcher that I like better."
2,Looks nice but the lid doesnt fit,"Looks nice. I like the square shaped base. However, the lid does not fit. It's supposed to increase in diameter when twisted so that the rubber seal will push tightly around the mouth, but even at the widest setting it doesnt come close to fitting properly. So the lid is basically useless except for keeping bugs out."
3,At least it's glass,PROS: it is glass - not plastic so no yucky chemicals leaching into your drink.CONS: Pouring is tricky - it dribbles. The lid is a little tricky and I wish the jug was larger so it could hold more liquid.
1,Can't cram 78oz of water into this jug,"Glass appears ok, haven't tried it with hot water yet. However, the capacity listed at 78.2 oz is MIS-LEADING. Only 72oz can be placed into this jug. And, that volume brings the water to the bottom of the lid. I'm tired of company's ripping off consumers with false descriptions, they shouldn't be allowed on amazon, let 'em go over to ebay to sell their junk. Also, the handle is very close, narrow fingers might be needed to hold the pitcher, just before you return it!If you're looking for a true pitcher, capable of 78oz+ capacity, look elsewhere."
2,Functional pitcher with ugly cheap lid,"It's heavy with thick glass and an unwieldy handle, but what is truly remarkable is the lid. The lid is *hideous*. I uploaded a photo of it. They had the gall to call this plastic eyesore a ""frosted lid."" The o-ring also comes covered in grease with questionable brown smudges on it. I'm throwing the lid into the garbage. The pitcher itself is only slightly ugly, so I'm going to live with it, but I'm not remotely pleased."
1,Arrived Broken,"My order was fulfilled by Westview Traders. Unfortunately I cannot find any contact info for them because I would have liked to have given them a chance to correct my order. This pitcher arrived in a hundred broken glass pieces because it was not properly packaged. I'm having to ship it back to Amazon now in order to get a refund. I would have been happy with just a replacement but the option wasn't available for me since my order was originally fulfilled by Westview Traders. From all the other reviews, I honestly think this pitcher would have been great. Just don't buy it if it's being offered by Westview Traders."
4,"Good, but needs better lid to seal.",Ordered two of these for my juicer. Good heavy glass but with there was a screw lid or something to give a better seal. It would be great if they came with a strainer too for pulp.
1,Glass broke with boiling water,"This pitcher broke when I tried to make iced tea in it. I poured boiling water in it and the bottom and side split. It was very disappointing, I thought for sure it could handle boiled water to make iced- tea."
4,Great for fresh juice,Nicely constructed and sized for easy fit while not taking up more room. Works great with the juicer since the glass and air tight cap are required for freshness.
5,Good Pitcher,I like the pitcher! Use it every day. The lid works just fine for me. I haven't found a pitcher anywhere else that I like better.
3,hornet6,"The handle is not very ergonomic as the space between the pitcher and the handle is very slim. The way the seal in the lid works is kind of weird. I wouldn't buy this pitcher unless you really want to be able to completely seal it for some reason. If that's a priority for you and you don't mind the slightly uncomfortable handle, then it may be for you."
5,Amazing Jar,"This is an amazing jar. I use it to store my juice for my juice fast. Many of the reviews I read on Amazon are not fair to this amazing jar! They confuse the opening and closing process which is very simple: Once placing the top on the Jar you hold the outer part of the top while turning the center piece in the top clock wise toclose and lock the airtight jar, to open ityou do everything the same way except you turn the center piece in the top counter clock wise! It's that simple and because of this little jar I've bought a whole set of Bormioli jars ranging for 2 to 4 liters. Again, a great jar, ignore any review that tells you otherwise."
5,Seals very nicely,"The top creates a good, airtight seal. The jug appears well made. It is made of thick glass with a very sturdy handle."
5,Great Space Saver in Fridge,I love that I can have a compact pitcher to make orange juice in. The Hermetic Lid is just what I wanted to shake the juice up before serving. Great purchase.
4,Good Item,"Nice jug for mixing a 16oz can of OJ into 64 oz. If you put more that that into it, it will not pour properly. But even with 64 or less oz`s there still is a drop of drippage to contend with after each pour. The handle is to close to the body so it must be made for people with girly size fingers, but works fine ifin I`m careful. I modified the top by prying off the top of the bar part that you turn so I can seperate the 2 pieces and clean in between them."
1,I should have read more reviews....,"Glass needs to be properly tempered, which helps protect it from breakage, including when using it with hot or cold temperatures. From reading more of the reviews it appears that many people found that this product is not tempered well -- breaking all the time. And I should have read these.Instead when I opened the package, I got cut three times from a shard of glass, about the size of half a penny, that was hanging off the spout. Painful, but I thought it was just a left over piece of glass from the mold. But it turns out it was a piece that had pulled away from the spout leaving sharp edges. Yikes.Amazon came through and refunded me, but I won't buy from this manufacturer again, which is too bad since I was thinking of getting more jugs in this and other sizes."
5,I love this pitcher,"I love this pitcher! I recently decided that I was finished with plastic storage containers. I was concerned with how much plastic may have been leaching into my orange juice? So I searched for a glass pitcher that would fit into my refrig and cleanup easily either in the dishwasher or sink. When I got it in the mail I read the directions....but I don't remember reading about how the cover can totally be taken apart for cleaning. There is a narrow plastic piece that snaps on the top of the cover and holds it together. When I was cleaning it in the sink for the first time, I somehow unsnapped it and I thought I had broken the cover. What a delight to discover it wasn't broken the cover totally disassembles so you can clean it with ease. I am going to buy another one for my RV.Some have said that the handle is small....yes it is a little tight to the bottle but I don't have large hands so it's not a problem for me.Awesome product! Highly recommended."
5,quality piece,"I got this pitcher to store filtered water at room temp for mixing with baby formula and have been very satisfied with it. Other reviews are critical that it does not pour well but if you read the instructions, you'll see the lid makes a super-tight hermetic seal, so it's not supposed to be able to pour lidded. And again, with the instructions, you can get an airtight seal. Nice design and I love that I can clean it in the dishwasher."
3,nice but bulky,"I ordered 2 of these and was disappointed that they wouldn't fit on the door of my refrigerator. The ""Luminarc Quadro 2 Liter / 67.5 Ounce Jug/White Lid"" is much lighter and they fit side by side on the door taking up very little space."
2,"Not as tricky as everyone says, but not great","I bought two pitchers from amazon, this guy is the big loser. This isn't as complicated to use as everyone claims, and mine DID come with instructions. The problem is, the lid wasn't well designed, it doesn't work super well (especially when the rubber ring gets cold in the fridge). I like the shape, but sadly, I found this guy leaked on me fairly often. Not my fave."
2,Lid breaks easily,"I love everything about this pitcher except for the lid, which kind of ruins everything else. I like how it looks, I like the thick glass, I'm fine with the handle. THE LID: I understand it's supposed to seal and then you take it off to pour. Mine broke (something in it snapped) within the first two weeks of use, so there is no sealing anymore. Also, most people who are not used to using it (like guests) expect to pour it with the lid on, which creates a disaster (lots of spilled liquid) if someone besides yourself tries to serve themselves with it. If it had a different lid, I would buy this again. My spouse hates it, but I've learned to live with it."
2,Lid does not fit,"Jug is nice, heavy glass. Like the jug. Unfortunately I wanted one with lid, and this lid does not fit. Nice jar, cheap lid."
4,Small but good,"The only complaint I have about the jug is its kinda small. The lid fits tight and I like the shape of the jug. You have to know how to work the lid, but it fits good."
3,lid is a pain,"Nice water jars but the lid is troublesome. I pushed it down and turned it again and again only to have it come apart and fall into the water. I can get it to work if I'm careful but it's a poor design. You shouldn't have to figure this stuff out, it should just work."
3,Nice pitcher - weak handle.,"I purchased little pitcher as a gift for my teenage son who loves to make ice tea. Sadly, it arrived with the handle broken off. It was packed with ample amounts of burly bubble wrap but that was not enough to protect the handle. The body of the container itself seems solid and well made. Unfortunately, the handle is rather delicate by comparison. I returned this item and could not bring myself to reorder it. If the handle could not make it to my house there is no way it will survive more than a week in my house."
2,Loved it...for 3 months,"This pitcher was great. My wife and I used it for brewing green tea. Note, however the key word ""used."" The bottom cracked off cleanly after about 3 months. I didn't pay for that."
4,Handle is a little short,"It is comfortable, but I would prefer it if handle were longer. I'm a woman and the handle is shorter than my fist.I do like the square shape, for fitting into my fridge."
2,Arrived shattered twice,"I have a smaller sized one that works great for the kids to be able to pour their own milk. I wanted to get this larger size for iced tea. Unfortunately it arrived shattered in the box not once, but twice. I give up."
2,ITALIAN PITCHER,"I bought the 2L glass pitcher. Can't pick up by handle because fingers won't fit behind handle. On first use, the hermetic lid fell apart into three pieces. Have to remove lid to pour contents.Bormioli Rocco Frigoverre Jug with Hermetic Lid, 2-LitersDon't purchase it!"
5,Great for iced tea!,"I use this with my home iced tea maker all the time and it works great! I love the thick walls of glass - it is very durable. The lid works well enough but can be a little tricky to keep totally clean. Also the handle doesn't leave much room for fingers - I have big hands (men's large gloves) and it is a little tight for me. However at this price it seems like it will be hard to beat, and I do recommend it."
3,Mixed feelings.,"I really wanted to like this jug, but it couldn't withstand the cold temps in my fridge and cracked. I liked the design, and it worked fine until it cracked.I also have this http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VJQGHI/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8 which is holding up much better, but it does not come with a lid :/If I had to choose all over again, I would choose the 96oz style setter pitcher, as it's been more reliable."
1,Cracked after only 2 months of use!,"I ordered 2 pitchers in January and they arrived right on time. They were great for the first 2 months, then BOTH of them cracked within 2 weeks of each other. I enjoyed using them, but after both of them cracked I would not recommend purchasing these."
2,bad purchase,"Smaller than I thought it would be - short and squatty. Pitcher spills EVERYTIME you pour when over half full, and top will not seal, just sits on top and won't even let you pour around it, you have to remove it to pour from the pitcher."
4,Seems good overall,"The good... Nice thick glass, ingenious lid that creates a vacuum seal when turned tight. White rubber seal that is easy to remove and clean. Square shape makes better use of space in fridge.The not so good... As mentioned the handle needs about 1/4 inch more space in between. I have pretty average size hands and I can only get up to the second knuckle in there.The bad... Mine came with a very large bar code label attached, not the kind that just peels off, but the kind you must scrub off with soap and hot water. I would be washing it anyway, so not really a big deal.One last good thing... It is made in Italy and not China. American made would be better."
5,Bormioli Rocco Figoverre Jug with Lid,"Love this product!! I read the reviews and was worried about the lid but with one handyou hold the lid and with the other you twist - it's easy breezy. This time of yearwe drink a lot of ice tea, keeping it cold in the fridge in a plastic container is justnot the same as glass. Having the air tight lid keeps the tea fresh ... sssoo happywith the purchase."
5,Excellent value for price,Very sturdy; easy to open and seal lids; doesn't take a lot of space in the fridge. I'm very happy with these pitchers.
4,Good juice pitcher,This a good juice pitcher with a lid that can be tightened so that you can shake the juice before pouring if needed. The shape is a little short and fatter than desired for frig space but the lid is great.
2,Arrived Broken.,I had to send this back as it arrived broken and could not be replaced according to the seller. Return was easy. They did not package this correctly. Had no popcorn in it just a little bubble wrap around pitcher and it rolled around loose in box it was shipped in. I really wanted this but wasn't willing to reorder after seeing that they did not package correctly to see that it arrived safely.
2,disappointed,"I love the size and amount it holds. However, on only 3rd use, when I poured boiled water in it to make tea, it cracked. Not sure if I was not supposed to do this. Anyone??"
5,Superb Jug,"Beutiful design. Fits into my apartment-sized frig well without taking up too much space. Keeps my milk very well as it is so airtight. Much better then the plastic-coated paper cartons.No problems at all with the seal, easy-peasy."
5,great pitcher,"I keep water in the fridge with essential oils added to it, so I needed glass. these pitchers are wonderful. compact, so i can put them just about anywhere. the lid is tricky, but totally stays on tight...no leaks. I have two and am very pleased with my purchase. we use them daily."
4,Nice pitcher,"Nice, heavy pitcher. The lid forms a great seal when you follow the included instructions. I have to take the lid off to pour, but that's no biggie. I do wish I'd gotten the bigger one, though. Maybe that's my next purchase!"
5,plain and simple pitcher..,"I wanted something plain and functional. This is it! The cover is not dfficult to figure out, like some reviewers said. It closes tight, and is just perfect! I recommend this product! It was packed very well too."
5,Big fan of this guy!,"I just love this pitcher. It's the perfect size for my homemade lemonade, almond milk, etc. My favorite feature is the suction lid. By turning the dial at the top, you can suction the pitcher, Brilliant! Awesome purchase."
5,"I love this pitcher, I bought two!","I love this pitcher because of its size. I usually fill with ice water to keep by my bed at night. The top kept the cat from deciding it was his water to drink. However, my puppy somehow got hold of one of the lids and chewed it up, I sure would like to find a replacement."
3,It was a great jug while it lasted!,"I found this jug to be just as advertised for the last two years, but lost it today to shock. It was supposed to be shock-resistant, and perhaps it was as I made iced tea in it every time I used it, but it is definitely not shock- proof. The lid worked really well and the compact size meant it fit well in many places in the refrigerator. I like it enough to give it another try as far as being my iced tea pitcher. Any advice on avoiding shock will be helpful. (I didn't put the hot water in a cold pitcher or anything.)"
3,Handle,"Overall, I guess I am satisfied with this purchase. However, what makes me uncomfortable is the handle. I cannot grab it with all my fingers especially when it is full. I can only use my three fingers to hold it. I wish it was longer just to avoid accidental drop."
4,Good Size for the Frig,"This pitcher has a nice small footprint and short stature for the frig, but holds a full 2 liters. It's made out of good thick glass and feels like a quality product. The wide mouth makes it easy to clean and fill.Other reviewers commented that they had trouble with the lid--It's really no problem at all.The bad: The spout tends to dribble a bit. The handle is too close to the body of the pitcher for those with large hands.Overall, I would recommend to anyone who wants a glass pitcher that will last a long time and fits nicely into any area of the frig."
5,These Glass Containers are THE BEST!,I was a little concerned after reading the reviews that this product might not live up to my expectations- I purchased 1 of each size in November of 2011 and have been using all of them daily! The lid keeps the liquids airtight- does not spill and keeps juices and soups tasting fresh. Clean up is easy- and they are dishwasher safe if you decide to go that route. I have not found them to be difficult to handle in any way. I am thrilled with this purchase- and wish now I had ordered 2 of the 2-Liter size. It is the size I use the most - we are replacing our plastic containers with glass and Bormioli Rocco Frigoverre has done an excellent job with the design- both of the lid and the size and shape of the jars. The 2-litre is the size I reach for the most because we use it for soups and stews- I use the smallest one for homemade ranch dressing which keeps it tasting fresh - overall this purchase exceeded my expectations.
5,Excellent Product,"The glass used in this pitcher is superior in quality. The pitcher is durable and takes up very little space in the refrigerator. I have no issues with using the handle. I am a female with large hands. I know some have commented about the space between the handle and the pitcher, but you do not have to place your hands in that space you can simply hold the outside of the handle. It still offers a secure grip. My grown sons use it with no problem."
5,Buy this book if you want to improve your score at TWE,"I had to learn some grammar to take the TOEFL TWE, and this book was an excellent choice. It is very well written and edited. It is also very easy to read. It would be great if it had all the answers to the exercises, but it deserves five stars anyway."
5,Superb acting 101,"Like someone already commented and reviewed, who needs Special Fx, action sequences and CGI, when you can watch a nice little drama movie where the actors really can act and shine throughout the entire movie.Like I said Superb acting 101. Hurt doesn't get any better than here, Bello too. Eddie and Kristen are in a league of their own when it comes to young actors, they really know their craft.It's been so long since a movie has made me cry, and cry I did. I loved it. Highly recommend it."
3,Ok,The movie was ok. But mostly I could not get past the bad accents. I am from Louisiana myself and most ppl there do not sound like Kristen Stewarts character. She is a good actor and I love her movies but I don't think southern is really her strong point.
5,So cute and I love it !,This movie is so sad and romantic I love it Kristen Stewart was really cute and love the accent the actors had this movie is about love and it always finds its way if its meant to be :)
4,SOMETHING ELSE FOR A CHANGE,"Wow - here's a cool (independent) movie for a change which draws its strength from the characters and the landscape and not from some stupid cgi-action-wobbly-camera stuff. All the four main actors are great.By the way, there was a song in the sixties called ""Tie a Yellow Ribbon"" which may have triggered the plot a little bit ...PS It's definitely available on DVD, at least here in Germany."
5,Akin to the great films of the 1970's.,"""The Yellow Handkerchief"" is an exquisitely poetic film that takes everyday life and peels away the hard veneer of existence to show us the simple beauty all around us. It is superbly directed and acted with grace and stature. No film lover should miss this extraordinary masterpiece."
3,Yellow Handkerchief,The movie Yellow Handkerchief was ok..It was just not what I expected out of Kristen Stewart..although her acting was outstanding as always..just not a film I liked her in..that is all I can say is the movie is just ok..not much to it.
2,The loads need to be smaller than they say,"I just bought a cyclone washer and am disappointed with the size of load that it's capable of washing. All ads say that it can wash, ""Wash a shirt, slacks, shorts and a pair of socks in one load"". I have not found this to be true. It's great for socks and underwear, but groans if I try and put anything more than a couple of shirt or one pair of slacks/jeans in a one time. It's definitely better than hand washing, but hoped that it would hold a few more items."
4,cyclone washmate,"I am so pleased with my litte washing machine. It has improved the quality of my life many times over. I have washed a skirt, and even a dress as well as smaller items. This saves so many trips to the laudro-mat or to a relatives house. I wish it were UL listed, but I am careful with it... If you have a small space and need a compact washing machine, I recommend looking into this great little washer..."
2,Scratchy fabric,"This comforter was a Christmas gift for my son and he couldn't be happier with it. However I am very disappointed in the quality of the fabric used to manufacter the comforter. It is very scratchy and uncomfortable against the skin despite having been washed 3 times. I would not recommend this product and feel that it was overpriced for the quality of the fabric.I did give the product two stars however, as my son loves it."
5,sad story,it's a crazy story. almost seems fictional that this could happen!been following this case through other websites and it is just so outrageous that this could happen.
5,Stone has worked his magic once again,"How does Stone do it? In this book, he has taken a decent plot about a man attempting to sail around the world and filled it with so much philosophical reflection and relationship analysis that it becomes absolutely unforgettable. Anne is remarkably well-written, with honest human emotions and flaws, and Owen and Strickland both serve as great examples of various extremes of the human character. I particularly loved the aspects of the book dealing with Owen's relationship with his daughter and Anne's relationship with her father. While Outerbridge Reach is undeniably disturbing, it is an incredible tale that deserves to be read over and over."
2,Is the Human Race This Awful?,"Over a period of several years I had tried twice to read Robert Stone's ""Outerbridge Reach."" I just made a third try and this time got further than before --- to page 145, less than half way through. It's not that it's poorly written. Had it been, I'd have stopped with one try. No, my trouble with the book is that its every character is so incredibly unpleasant. Stone would appear to think the world is made up of nasty, self-absorbed, unhappy, manipulative people.I don't consider myself particularly optimistic about the human race, but if Stone sees his fellow humans in such an unremittingly negative light, I pity him."
5,great great writing,"I am a graduate of the General Program of Liberal arts, also known as the Great Books program at Notre Dame. We read a lot and diversely! This is a great book in every sense of the word and by anybody's standards except for those who disagree."
4,Oh my God thats me.,I first read this book 1990 It started me in the road to recovery from what I did not know then but now I do. 7 copies have been stolden by men looking to heal the hidden pain and shame. I know that you will find strength and ability to move on in your life staying stuck is no longer an option. This book also helped me understand the different way we were abused and how to start back to a healthy way of living. If you want understand someone that you know has been abused or suspected some abuse. This book will give you some understanding and a place to start healing yourself and others.
2,Not worth your time,"This is the worst book I have read in a long time. It has an intresting plot but doesn't live up to it's pontential. The author wastes far to much time blaming the Democrats and the liberals for all the problems in America. Rush Limbaugh fans would probaly love this book, but for me I read to get away from all the talking heads, on news shows, blaming each other for all the problems in the U.S.."
2,Overboard,What could have been a great series really went downhill. There are way too many overboard plot changes and details that don't follow each other.
1,What happened?,"I used to be a huge fan of the ""Ashes"" series, and I was disappointed with ""Flames in the Ashes"", but ""Treason"" is far worse. The book opens with a story that is totally different then the rest of the series and horribly jumps from one plot to the next. Anyone who is a fan of ""Out of the Ashes"" will be very upset after reading this novel because it is not what we've come to expect from WWJ."
3,"Decent reading for the ""Japanophile"".","In the follow-up to his very worthwhile book ""Autumn Lightning"", Dave Lowry takes the reader to a Japan from centuries ago in an effort to explore his own roots in the Japanese Martial Arts. He accomplishes this in a sometimes long-winded and meandering way, but by the end of the book you feel like you were right along with him, walking ancient paths, visiting temples, cemeteries, and traditional martial arts halls. This is a good book for a martial artist interested in a time past, or anyone fascinated by the culture and history of feudal Japan."
2,A bit disappointing,"I as a bit disappointed in this work verses Dave Lowry's other works. I was hoping for more of his experiences training and less history, which is available in many places."
1,"NOT ""Pure Matcha Green Tea""",The ingredients say Green Tea Matcha powder. There is no mention of sugar in the contents. This is a product that contains sugar. NOT GOOD FOR DIABETICS or people who can not have sugar. Also the color is not bright green but more of an olive/tan color. This product description is very misleading. I will return to the 100% organic Green Tea Matcha powder from Eden Foods which I have purchased in the past and was extremely happy. BUYERS BEWARE!
4,Not quite as disturbing as all that...,"Read the other reviews. You will get a good idea of the film. It is disturbing, and it is something that you can picture actually happening. The characters all seem ""real"", their reactions fitting the personality of each appropriately. But... if you have seen Kids, Bully, Requiem For A Dream, Eraserhead, Irreversible or any of the other reality horrors... this one won't be quite as disturbing as you might otherwise be led to believe. Personally, I find the Billboard top 200 much more distrubing than this. And the mall."
4,"Estes triumphs with ""Mean Creek""","Inevitably compared with Rob Reiner's 1986 classic ""Stand By Me"", Jacob Aaron Estes' ""Mean Creek"" stands up well to the comparison.Essentially, it is a simple story of young teenager Sam (Rory Culkin) whose older brother and friends plot revenge on George, a school bully (Josh Peck). Revenge is to take the form of a river trip where George is to be stripped and abandoned to find his own way home . . . but George, at close quarters, turns out to be rather different, if not actually likeable. Things go horribly wrong and the kids are left to deal with far more than bullying.Like ""Stand By Me"", this film has brought together a group of young actors whose performances are seamless. Each character is individual and utterly believable.Estes tells a moral tale without, even for a moment, becoming maudlin or sentimental. Beautifully filmed in an exquisite setting, it is a disturbing movie which makes its viewers re-examine their own adolescent behaviour."
3,When Plan B comes too late.,"Five teenagers stare solemnly at a fresh flow of rolling murky water, their minds fixed on a question, ""How exactly did we get here?"" Their decision to exact mild revenge on the town bully has reaped devastating consequences, and yet, even darker events lie ahead for all of them.Mean Creek is a depiction of what happens when the bottom falls out, as our carefully calculated plans take on a life of their own, leaving us as mere spectators while the actions around us take the wheel and drive drunken and headlong into the realm of unseen, maddening circumstances.An extremely dark film and you should be warned. This type of cinema is not for everyone. Even still, if you are an indy-hound, Mean Creek will likely serve as an ample offering to your unique taste. I enjoyed the premise, but some of the characters were a bit contrived. Overall, however, Mean Creek is solid entertainment and will keep you involved."
4,Mean Creek,"I respect a director who writes his own material. What Jacob Estes did here was to visualize half a dozen characters, find the right actors to portray them, and film an excellent story. I appreciate how he was able to pull the viewer right into the conflict, immediately, and how his story unfolded quite naturally from the characters themselves. This is definitely a film I'll watch a few more times.It turns out that some child actor named Rory Culkin is a damn fine actor. I promise not to dislike him based on his last name. Also, the initial antagonist in this film is mature beyond his years. Maybe there outta be a law against how he could make me flip-flop between like and dislike so quickly. Nah, probably not. He's great."
3,MARVELOUS CAST IN SO-SO MOVIE,"The young actors in MEAN CREEK are truly brilliant in this tale of a revenge plot that goes tragically awry. A group of friends decide to get revenge on the bully who has recently attacked one of the group. While on this boat trip, everyone but one personc changes their minds, and decides not to go through with the prank. But events lead to a tragic resolution and here's where the story falls into its predictable do the right thing scenario. But it is the performances of the youths that makes this a mesmerizing if somewhat unsatisfying film. Led by Rory Culkin as Sam, the bully's victim, these young performers are right on target in capturing the angst, guilt and sometimes perilous adventures of youth."
3,worth a look,"mean creek is a well-made movie. it kept me hooked the whole way through. it doesn't fall into dumb 2 dollar cliches that so many thrillers with teens do. the acting is swell, especially from the fat kid george. the people seem real. the colors are pretty. cool colors. it's also has good music (spoon and wilco!). this is one of those movies that is good the first time you see it but loses its intensity upon a second viewing. that's why i say, rent it. or buy it if one day you see it in the value section at target."
1,"Nice try, but it's called ""River's Edge"".","Terrible movie. Incredibly bad acting. The story was made to order, developing no character descriptions. The plot is introduced like an after-school special. If you've seen this, please tell me why the fellow whom did nothing wrong (didn't even touch the kid who drowned) takes his brother's car, robs a convenient store and heads for Mexico? What was he running from? He did nothing wrong so there was absolutely no reason for him to go on the run! This movie was very stupid. I couldn't even watch the last ten minutes (I was convinced it wasn't going to redeem itself)."
1,Slow,This was the slowest movie I've ever seen. All the action happened in the last 10 minutes.DONT SEE IT.
5,Great Movie,"This movie now is one of my favorites. If you've not seen it, do yourself a favor and rent or buy it. You want be disapointed."
4,"Lord of the Flies, Muted","This movie reminds me of The Lord of the Flies, in that it's about a group of young people, off on their own, who play out the spite, the frustration, and the anger, that has been building in them during their days pent up under school/parental supervision. However, this movie is not the broad, symbolic myth of Lord of the Flies. The teens drift toward an even greater tragedy than they had planned here, in a realistic nuanced manner.The acting is excellent. The photography captures the soft idyllic appearance of their outing - the clear, sunny weather, the gentle lapping of the stream they are navigating. But in the insect-humming heat, you can feel the tensions mount.Only the ending feels unconvincing. Somehow, I don't think real teens would be that anguished over the events of the day. Nor do I think the average teen would insist on taking responsibility in the way these individuals do, when it would have been so easy to deny or pass the blame. But see what you think."
5,Breathtaking,"It's movies like 'Mean Creek' that fuel my passion to become a director. This movie is amazing. When it finished I let out of a huge breath, and said to myself, ""wow"". It hits you hard, and is not a film you will easily forget.Simply astounding."
2,Frustrating,This is a wonderful book but this particular edition is printed in such small type that I can barely read it. I would have returned it but the book is so compelling that I'm reading despite the struggle.
4,The Little Flowers of St. Francis of Assisi,I always enjoy the stories about St. Francis. It just amazes me that he could live in such poverty and embrace as he did. He received such glory and joy from God by his way of life.
5,little flowers of st francis of assisi,"I feel inspired by the depth of spiritual experience of St. Francis and his friars. Whenever I pick up this book and begin reading I feel transported into a realm where God's love is so real and palpable. The 13th century language at first seemed awkward to follow, however, once I felt the spirit of the stories the language barrier disappeared"
4,Splendid,"Splendid effort here by old friends Peru Ubu. I was a big fan in the early days, saw them a couple of times in Boston, and would always listen to ""The Modern Dance"" and ""Dub Housing"" etc from time to time but never sought out newer material until I saw David Thomas on a NPR Music Show singing ""Wine Spoody Oody"" or something and he was in fine form, swigging off a flask and I was astonished at his singing voice (once again) he was magnificent.Any who, I gave ""Why I Hate Women"" a spin and was knocked out, I love it!"
2,Ok..,I was stationed in Germany for 6 years and this video brought back alot of fond memories. Color is poor but presentation is alright. NOT quite what I was expecting
3,An Intriguing Glimpse of Africa,"As an old fan of the Tintin adventure series, I was curious to see whether this was another adventure I had never heard of. It is actually part of a new series based on diaries Tintin may have kept during his travels.The ""diary"" provides interesting facts and beautiful photographs which give the reader an intriguing glimpse of a continent which remains a mystery to many people. It depicts another world, especially in this age of technological advances.The diary touches on the geography, culture, customs and the heritage of Africa. It also highlights the plight of Africa: poverty, famine, drought and political unrest.I liked this book because any child would find it a fascinating introduction to a great continent. The format is fun and the information concise. Adult readers will want to add it to their collection of Tintin adventures to pass on to their kids."
4,A second look,"After reading more I decided to keep the book. I changed my rating from two to four stars. I want to be fair to the book; It is much better than initially stated. In terms of the source code... it is not too much of an issue; the code is compact and to the point (still better if they provided the code).I did buy Practical UNIX Programming and are using both books. Along with UNIX System V Network Programming by Rago, I have the necessary stepping-stones into the Steven's Books (TCP 1-3, Advanced UNIX, UNIX Network Programming Vol1-2, etc)."
4,Good book,"A good technical book; A stepping-stone into Advanced UNIX Programming by Steven's.As an alternative... I purchased Practical UNIX Programming by Kay A. Robbins, Steven Robbins, Kay, Ret Robbins. It is better priced and hardcover. The Contents are compatible to the above book and full source-code is on the Web."
1,Disappointing & Unimaginative Party Book,"I was truly disappointed with this book. I was not inspired by any of the book's suggestions while looking for ideas for my daughter's upcoming birthday. There are few illustrations or photographs of actual parties, cakes, or crafts - the pages are filled with oversized clip art- for example a half page photo of Native Americans on the ""Native American party"" page, or drawings of zebras on the ""African party"" page. Ideas for the African party include hanging a poster of a monkey and serving hot dogs! How unique and unforgetable is that? The dinosaur party ideas include serving peanut butter sandwiches and having large inflatable dinosaurs for decoration. How boring. If you need unique ideas, look elsewhere."
5,Learn how God wants to forgive you and enjoy it.,"Ever wondered if God really forgave you for something? Have trouble forgiving yourself for something you did or didn't do yesterday or years ago? If you answer yes to any of the above, you must read this book. Joe, in an easy reading format, gives great insight into the subject of God's Grace, our need for it, and how to know it works for you."
2,Another toaster failure,"I bought this toaster because I was impressed with the performance of a Cuisinart ""Commercial"" toaster in a motel breakfast room. I like toast to be toasted, not warmed, and at first, this toaster really performed. But now, one year later, this toaster is just tepidly warming the bread. It's on its way to the charity bin, sadly."
4,Cool little toaster,"This little toaster has shown itself to be reliable, and good as new. Toasts evenly. We always like ""Texas toast"", and it handles the larger bread in good order. Inexpensive too, with rocket fast shipping."
3,"Arrived with permanent marks, but works great","We love the way our new toaster works and it looks quite stylish. There were some fingerprints and marks that we were unable to remove, but for the price it wasn't worth the time or postage to return. We love it but hide it in the corner of the kitchen."
1,Don't waste your time,"Cannot agree more with the first reviewer. I have seen better produced home movies. I wouldn't even bother giving it away to someone, unless you don't like them."
2,Website Does Work,"The website url given by ""Thinking Person"" does work, if you type it in correctly. I not only brought it up, I copied all of the book, plus the extras, to disk. To the reviewer who said it doesn't work - don't put www in front of it. Type the url in EXACTLY the way ""Thinking Person"" has it - http://johnkerrythenewsoldier.blogspot.com, then save it to your Favorites. And thanks to ""Thinking Person"" for the url."
1,At least leave your name...,"If you're going to leave a review here attempting to slam our (and your) president, at least have the courage to leave your public nickname. ""A reader from St. Louis, MO United States"" ... I doubt you've read much farther than your latest ""Take back our Country in 2004"" memo from the DNC. Enjoy enduring another 4 years of your own bitterness and rancor under ""W"". Remember, it's what makes our country great!"
1,The New Soldier? I Hope Not!,"If throwing your medals away and leading a Veterans Against the War movement sounds good to you, then this is your book. For that matter, if this doesn't sound like your definition of a patriot then this book by a potential president of the U.S. is definitely required reading. Just too bad that we can't get a copy anymore. What a coincidence. Maybe after the elections."
1,Give us a break....,"I gave one star because that is the minimum. I am so sick of his ""heroics"" that he uses in each speech...he is not representative of the Vietnam warrior, he is a professional veteran that has figured out a way to get to the top of the dung heap. I read perhaps 2 chapters before tossing it where it belongs."
1,The book Kerry used to smear Vietnam Vets!,No picture huh? What crap. Kerry used this book and his little episode in front of Congress to smear all American soldiers in Vietnam as baby killers.He leaves out how his heros the Kennedys (and LBJ) made a lot of money off JFK's Vietnam War.Kerry decided he wanted a piece of the money pie for himself.He hooked up with Hanoi Jane to smear Vietnam Vets thus ensuring him a career in the Democratic Party. The irony or hypocrisy was that his hero JFL started the Veitnam War.The book fails to mention how Kerry stabbed POWs & MIAs in the back when he became a Senator. He rushed through the normalization of relations with Vietnam so his cousin's realty company could get an exclusive from the Hanoi govt that is worth billions.
1,Expensive,"They have some on ebay, autographed too, however they are very expensive. Perhaps the Heinz's millions are driving up the prices by trying to buy them up."
3,A seminal work in Kerry's political milieu,Not only is this book a must-read if you want to understandKerry's political milieu; you must also see thepictures. Many images from the book are readily availableon the internet. (...)
1,Re: What's all the fuss.,"Hay ""A reader from california"" can't you read, the cover of the book says ""BY JOHN KERRY"". So what is up with the not by or about John Kerry statement. It's by John Kerry it's his book so therefore he approved the cover with the mocking of the marines at Iwo Jima, and the Stars and Stripes upside down. NOT VERY PATRIOTIC, THAT IS THE FUSS."
1,vvajk( vietnam vets against John Kerry),"This book depicts vietnam veterans as rapists and murderers. The larger majority of veterans including myself who served in Vietnam did not rape or murder civilians, nor did we commit any of the other atrocities claimed. In most of the accounts the veterans are commenting on what someone else did. John Kerry was an officer. If he saw these things happening why didn't he stop them.This book is a great disservice to all veterans who served proudly and with honor in Vietnam."
1,Wil The REAL JFK Please Stand Up?,"John Kerry wants to be both the poster-boy for the anti-American, hippie, grass-smokin' protestor, AND display his medals to whomever will look. While Kerriacs go ape over his ""heroism"" they won't comment on their own defense of Bill Clinton's outright draft dodging and escape to England. Kerry has nerve to call people like my husband, a vet, ""babykillers."" If Kerry did see atrocities in Vietnam, he is guilty of not saying anything to a commander. If he made it up, he's a traitor to his own people, spreading lies about Americans. This book will surface somewhere, and show him to be the two-faced person he is. Liberals usually don't vote for medal-wavers, Kerry."
1,read it; hated it,"I utilized my friendly neighborhood public librarian who found this book for me via interlibrary loan (a very useful tool). So, for any doubting Thomases--yes, I read the book!This thing is an atrocity in the world of literature. First of all, it is reminiscent of a bad Time/Life collection piece. If anything, Kerry's portion was probably written by an underpaid speechwriter for the political wannabe. It is biased propoganda, and except for those purchasing an oddity for their personal shelves, should only be read by those society misfits who would not be able to afford the $595 pricetag anyway. DEFINITELY NOT worth the money. The only reason for giving it one star is because zero was not an option."
1,"Once a flip-flopper, always a flip-flopper","Let's see, claim war hero status and then bad mouth your brethren and the military. This misguided, hippie-loving effort shows Kerry to have a total lack of moral compass. I wonder what was going through Kerry's mind when he falsely claimed to be throwing his own medals over the walls of the White House, while actually keeping them. Probably the same sort of flip-flopping that has marked his later years."
4,This is a great book,I really like this book a lot. The pictures of John Kerry are great. He looks so regal and distinguished. I truly feel that he would make a great president!Lets not make the same mistakeKerry in 2008!
1,Time to get copies of this book now!!!,"Why can't we get copies of this book? It would seem that during an election year, when one of the top contenders for the presidency, people should be able to see what Kerry published."
1,Gee I wonder why these aren't available?,"Isn't it obvious why you can't find this book? It's just like critics have said about the extreme liberal... if you knew what they were really thinking, we'd have them boiled in oil..."
2,Ketchup Kerry,"How does one win three purple hearts in three months without ever having seen the inside of a hospital, well you won't find the answer in this book. Indeed the first and third purple hearts required no medical treatment at all, the second one two stiches for a small cut. But, presto, three purple hearts and according to Navy regulations one is out of combat forever, and thus so was Kerry. Oh, and he also won the bronze and silver star during his recuperation from his multiple, well what shall we call it, ""wounds."" I read this book when it came out, I was in college and it was assigned for my Poly Sci class as it was called then. We were very impressed as only nineteen year olds could be, three decades later my B.S. detector is tripping off the scale."
1,Kerry is a weakling,"After reading this book you will know he's not the right man for the White House. I think the Bush-campaign should make it avaliable in the election campaign. Kerry would never stand a chance if people knew what a weakling he really is and how he hates his country. In these times of ""terro-war"" we don't need a man even weeker than Jimmy Carter."
1,"Read America's ""most banned"" book!","Since hard copies are rarer than a straight answer from Hanoi John (and nobody beneath his lofty income bracket can afford them), try www.kerryflipflop.net. At Ebay's going rate, you'll save about $800."
1,Merchant send me an incorrectly labeled product,"I had ordered two memory sticks. Amazon's product description matched those of the memory stick requirements I had. The product arrived on time and I inserted the two memory sticks. My server run great but a few weeks later started having a memory parity error message which would bring the server to a halt. When I researched the source of the error and checked on the two recently installed memory sticks, I discovered that one of them had two labels, one form the manufacturer and a second one from the merchant but none were consistent with the product specifications. On the other memory stick both the manufacturer and the merchant labels were consistent.I removed the incorrect memory stick and my server is not showing the parity error message anymore."
5,Triumph of Spirit,"A gripping, heart-wrenching tale of the triumph of the human spirit over tragedy. After viewing the world through Zubaida's eyes, you'll never look at life the same way."
5,A Lesson for All In Perseverance,"What an incredible story of real life perseverance through the life of this heroically strong willed child. In the world of problems and fighting, this is an amazing real life story about people from all around the world of different lifestyles and beliefs joining together for one little girl. That union has lead to changing so many lives and beliefs and has resulted in the beautiful must read of TINY DANCER. Read this book and share with your family and friends to uplift your spirits and life."
5,HOPE AND THE HUMAN SPIRIT,"From the moment nine and a half year old Zubaida Hasan accidentally fell into a kerosene fire while heating water for her bath,I could not put down TINY DANCER. Yes, this is a story filled with Zubaida's physical and mental pain, but this is also a marvelous, true story of hope and human caring ... from the American Green Beret soldier who by chance saw Zubaida and her father on a street in Afghanistan to Dr. Peter and his wife, Rebecca, Grossman in Los Angeles, CA. This is a story of hope, and the very best of human nature in difficult times. Zubaida's transformation back to normalcy thanks to Dr. Grossman's skill and the many individuals willing to become involved despite the possible repercussions to their own careers reinforced my belief in the inherent goodness of people. Bravo!"
5,Great Read,A true story that gives hope that cultural and political differences can be overcome. The book also provides great insight to how determination and acts of kindness go a long way. Well written and easy to read and follow.
4,Fictionalized writing style is not right for this story,"This is a very incredible and inspiring story of human generosity and perseverance that transcends cultures - and you have already read about the subject matter in the other reviews so I am not going to repeat that. What I did not like was the fictionalized style of prose. The author seems to go inside the heads of the main characters and describe exactly their feelings, thoughts, perceptions etc. and this gives the prose a fictionalized, exaggerated, and subjective feel which applied to a true story, did not somehow feel right. I would have preferred it if the people in this story could have been interviewed to find out exactly how they felt rather than the getting the author's imaginary versions of their reactions. Even though most readers here seem to like it, I feel that this fictionalized style wasn't the right choice for this true story."
5,A Powerful Movie,I had the pleasure of seeing an early screening of this film and only one word comes to mind.......magnificent! Everything from the cast and crew to the dialogue was brilliantly composed into a film that keeps you engaged from the beginning to the end.This is definitely a movie that sticks out and stays with you.
5,Incredible film!,This is a stunning film that once finished I immediately wanted to watch again. Never before have I been so captivated by a film from the very start. The cast is outstanding! The scenes between Rick Gomez and Frank John Hughes are mesmerizing. The story is incredible and made me feel like I was experiencing Henry's journey right along with him. This is what films are supposed to be.
5,A masterfully told film full of suspense and deeply moving,I had a chance to see this film at the Gasparilla Film festival - where it won both the audience award and best film! Robert Celestino is a master storyteller who grabs you in the opening minutes of this film and never lets you go. The movie is full of suspense and wonderful performances by all involved. This is a true indie gem that must be seen! It is an exciting and deeply moving film.
5,Great!,"It was a twisty mind-screw of a movie that kept me guessing. The story is captivating, the performances are flawless and the direction is above reproach. See for yourself!"
1,trouncing the dow,"While this book seems to have a technique for 'trouncing the dow', the vast majority of the book is just filler that gives very little insight into the methodology. The whole idea takes less than one small chapter, and leaves many questions unanswered. I was very disappointed."
3,Common Sense but....,"I found this book very thought provoking which is good. But, I checked out the test figures that he has in the back of the book with information found in the latest Value Line and the numbers don't jive. The author gives test figures for the reader to use so that they can make sure they are doing the math correctly. When I compared those figures with the actual figures in Value Line, they were inconsistent. For someone like myself who is not all that great at math to begin with, I need as much guidance and clarity as I can find. The author throws out terms but not all of them are clearly defined, this does not help when attemtpting to do complicated math equations. He would have been better off showing a copy of the Value Line pages that he mentions then highlight each area within that page as it relates to the terms he is using. Return on Equity, Book Value, Current Book Value, etc. mean nothing to me if I don't know where they are located on the Value Line page."
2,Save your money on this cut and paste job.,"Save yourself some money by taking a pen and pencil to the bookstore and write down the formula on pages 68 and 69. The rest of the book is pure cut and paste from other similar books and a bunch on charts and data tables to fill up space. This book has tons of contradictions, spelling mistakes and so on. BUT, I do think the formula for picking stocks is good and I intend to use it in my screening. I object to the ""fill"" text which is just used to pad the pages. As an author I know the drill - the publisher wants pages!"
3,Very informative book - great for a novice wanting to learn.,"I have always wanted to understand the business of stocks, etc. I grew up in a mildly educated family and, being the reserved girl, was afraid to voice my quest for this field. Due to personal situations afterwards, I still neglected this quest, until just recently when a friend of mine had this book lying on her desk. I immediately asked to see the book and was pleasantly surprized that I actually understood it! I'd expected it to be in terms I wouldn't understand and there is even a self test at the end to learn with. My first try was a distracted rough draft but the second time I was pleased. I have since tried to enlighten my own Mother to the book. And if she has good results it'll be well worth the mere cost of the book. Thank you Kenneth Lee"
5,Trouncing the Dow Big Time in 2000,"FYI...the benchmark investing strategy introduced in Trouncing the Dow is living up to its reputation thus far in 2000. While the Dow Jones Industrial average is under water, benchmark investing is up 18% including dividends year-to-date.Isn't it nice to see something that continues to live up to its promise? The hardest part of earning those gains this year would have been to invest in down-and-out ""value"" stocks while the high-fliers in the Nasdaq were enjoying such staggering gains. Oh yeah, the Nasdaq is under water in 2000, too."
3,The life of the Lady Lex.,"This story was written back in 1942, so it is rather dated as far as WWII history is concerned. The U.S.S. Lexington was a battle cruiser converted to an aircraft carrier while still in the shipbuilding process. This famous aircraft carrier was one of the handful the U.S. kept in the Pacific to hold back the Japanese onslaught at the beginning of World War II.Johnson details the life of the ship prior to her sinking. He interviews the crew and gets the feel for life aboard an aircraft carrier. Since he is writing in 1942, he details the force formation the Lex was sailing with, by saying Cruiser I, or Carrier II. Carrier II is obviously the Yorktown. References to the enemy are in a derogatory and rascist manner, so this sets the book back.This book gives a good feel to what is was like in 1942. The U.S. was battling for its life, and the enemy were evil. News was censored, so journalists couldn't not report everything. A nice read for a WWII era book."
4,how to live on an island,"Excellent little book for a gift....we are located on a small island in the Caribbean surrounded by beautiful, sandy, lovely beaches so this book is great for continuation of those thoughts of relaxing on the beach!!A bit expensive, but a good seller in this little store.."
2,"picture book, only!","my son is a huge byron barton fan; we read _machines at work_, _planes_, and _trucks_ several times a day. i was VERY disappointed to see that _tools_ is merely pictures with the name of the tool below/beside/above it. tools included: clippers, rake, electric drill, pliers, hammer, saw, hoe, shovel, screwdriver, monkey wrench, trowel & mallet and chisel. first of all, i wouldn't classify a rake as a tool. secondly, the pages feel flimsier than on his other board books.save yourself the trouble. this one's not worth getting."

1,"Poor fit, won't stay on","This ""universal"" item wouldn't fit on my hair dryer, so I bought a new one. After forcefully shoving it on, very little air was able to come through. Then the diffuser kept popping off the hair dryer. So the box is gone and now I'm stuck with it. A waste of money."
1,Not a satisfactory translation!,"Doniger is unable to see the context in which Laws of Manu were written. She takes them as representing the ancient laws of India, and that is not true. Indian tradition knows of several competing smritis. Furthermore, community law always held precedence over normative books such as Manu Smriti. She is also overly literal and this causes her to often miss the import of the verses."
1,Deeply flawed,"The shortcomings of Doniger's general Indological scholarship have been detailed by Michael Witzel and Rajiv Malhotra. This book suffers from the same flaws. The translations are idiosyncratic, and she is obsessed with finding sex, even in situations that none is called for."
1,Author does not know of manusmriti's(non)importance in India,"Manusmriti is not the ancient Indian lawbook as this claims it to be. It is just one of many smriti's written. This was popularised by the british who wanted to impose one single law ove India where none existed. And, so they could claim that they ruled India using Indian laws. In India community law is always more important then manusmriti or any of the other number of smritis. To assume that manusmriti is The ancient lawbook of India would be a folly."
5,The King of Reality TV,"I remember this video from when I was about 10 years old. My sister, cousins, and I would play this over and over. We knew EVERY dance step. Michael was better looking back then. We loved seeing the ""quirky"" moments on this video that showed his true character...I wonder if he's still the same????? It's a great video that is the ultimate of Behind the Scenes or The Making Of... type of videos. If you're interested in costume make-up or what goes into the making of videos this is a good tape. I don't listen to this type of music now, but this brings back a lot of my good childhood memories. It represents times when we were happy and songs were about simple things, not killing, fighting, and all of the crazy and obscene things that songs are being made about now."
5,THRILLER,"They need to make this on DVD and they also need to make Moonwalker on DVD too. They need to help Michael get back. The video ""Thriller"" did good back in the 80's. I would do good if it can back now. This is Michael's best video that he made and is the best video ever made to mankind. No one can match to Thriller. It's the best, nobody can beat the person who is the best. Also it is almost like he wrote how to make music videos and people follow that."
2,Disappointment,"I have read most of johanna lindsey`s books and I love most of them I was, however disappointed with this book. It is a very pathetic attempt at a sequel. I loved the story of Chandos and Courtenay, but the tory of threir daughter is weak and flawed at best. I though thre character of Damien was undeveloped and he was a hard character to love and therfore easily forgettable. Casey came across as a spoilt brat who hates it whn she doesn't get her way. Not to mention the storyline was wildy unbelievable."
4,All I Need is You,Nice to see a woman is more capable than the man. Was being to wonder now they were going to make him be less helpless. They did end up making him more helpful and less helpless which was good. Thought it was good story but a little slow or lacking in the beginning. Not much romance though. Had a hard time deciding between giving it a 3 and giving it a 4.
3,"Ok, not great","I have been rereading all the Johanna Lindsey books and just recently read 'A Heart So Wild' and then followed it up with this book. It was great to see Chandos and Courtney again and see how they turned out...kids, ranch, etc. So many of Lindsey's sequels are great, but this one was only so-so. Don't get me wrong, this book wasn't awful - it just wasn't terrific. 'A Heart so Wild' was a wonderful love story from start to finish with just great storytelling. 'All I Need is Love' was missing the depth of character and detailed storyline that 'A Heart so Wild' had. It felt very rushed and sloppy, as if Lindsey didn't take the time to really put her heart in it. I say read this book if you want to catch up with the characters from 'A Heart so Wild' but otherwise give it a miss."
3,"liked, not loved","it was a cute book, i like the setting and the plot, but it didn't captivate me. it was a book i could put down and just read whenever i was bored, as oppesed to all of JL other books, were i am so in to the book, i usually wind up reading it in one setting, but this bored one me. their wasnt enough spark if you ask me, but it wasnt a complete lost, had a bunch of good and funny parts, thats what kept me to see the end of this book. i did feel like i was with them and i kept wondering if casey and damianin would ever get together. hopefully you find a good book."
3,Okay,"I really enjoy reading books by Johanna Lindsey, but this one wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was nice to have a heroine instead of a hero, but I thought that Damien Rutledge III was a little too wimpy for my taste. I wished he had been a little bit stronger in order to make the romance a little more realistic. Most strong women don't want a weak man for a husband."
1,Worst Lindsey Ever,"I can't believe that THIS book was the follow-up to Lindsey's blockbuster ""A Heart So Wild."" Casey's dad Chandos was man to fall madly in love. Unfortunately, this story's ""hero"" (or ""zero"") is a WIMP. Casey is totally annoying. I also didn't like the way Casey got away with everything. If Lindsey had stayed true to Chandos' character, then he would NEVER have let her go bounty-hunting with some strange man. Overall, this is a major disappointment. If you see this book, run in the opposite direction!"
1,ya-wn!,"This is definitely the worst jl book ever. The couple had NO chemistry, and the plot was just plain boring. I love JL, but this one is a major ""thumbs down."""
3,"A ""Pass the time"" Book","This particular book had a very slow start up. In the previous novels I have read by Johanna Lindsey, by Chapter 3-4 I was wanting more. In this case, it was a task just picking up the book. It got exciting midway, then it got long and drawn out again. I just wanted to finish and get it over with. Not one of her best works. If your are home on a Sunday with nothing else better to do, this book will probably help you pass the time."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"j.l could have done much better, i liked the synopsis, but the dialect and, just the way it was written, i was very dissapionted, so i advise you to not buy this book"
1,Boring !!!,I have read many of Johanna Lindsey's romances and was very disappointed in this book. I found the characters boring along with the entire story. Definately not one of her best efforts.
2,Disappointing,"Thsi story was not good enough to follow the beautiful love story between Courtney and Chandos(Casey's mom and pop). Damian just was not sexy enough, and I liked Casey but there comes a point when she is just too headstrong and she stops focusing on her goals. Lindsey is one of my favorites, but I will stick with her older stuff."
1,"BORING, lindsey has disppointed me again!!","Lindsey's last two novels have both been published first in hardcover. What a rip-off!! I have totally enjoyed her previous books--both of these last works ""say you love me"" and this one work better than tranquilizers as far as putting an insomniac to sleep. Come on Ms Lindsey, you can do better than this. Please bring back the charisma associated with previous characters and the electricity between the hero and heroine."
2,Disappointed!,"Rarely am I ever disappointed with Johanna Lindsey's books, but this book is a rarity! The characters were shallow, never allowing me to get to know them or understand them. The subplot of Casey Stanton's parents relationship, and I am being very generous calling this a subplot, was the most interesting element. I thought I couldn't wait for this to be in paperback-I should have! After being thoroughly pleased with her last book, I have gone from one extreme to the other."
5,Johanna Lindsey wrote another fantastic book.,This another one of Ms. Lindsey work of arts. The characters of Casey and Damien really come to life. It really is a must read book.
4,Johanna writes you into the story.,"Johanna Lindsey is one of THE best dialog authors I have ever read. This novel is no exception. It moves from witty to sensual in the blink of an eye. Her writing style makes you feel as though you are right there on the range with Casey and Damian. I did not put the book down even once. With this, as withany Lindsey novel, it would have been an insult to do so."
2,Not up to her old standards,"I thought this book was going to be lots of fun. Unfortunately, the characters made big mistakes that distracted from the fun. The heroine comes across as childish. And the hero acts like a know-it-all, even though he's a tenderfoot.Even worse, the last part of the book is anticlimatic. After Casey and Damian solve their main problem, the book starts to drag.If you want to enjoy a Lindsey, reread one of your favorites instead of buying this one. I gave this one a D+ at All About Romance."
3,"Boring, a big disappointment.","I usually love to read Johanna Lindsey books, but this new book was a disgrace to the romance world. I think that she needs to write new Mallory books. They are my favorite books by Lindsey."
4,another Lindsey pleaser,"I loved this, but I love all of Johanna Lindsey's books. This was a great read. Casey is an amusing and thoroughly real heroine. Her struggles and minor character flaws endear her to you and create a believable atmosphere. The description of her travelling on her own as a bounty hunter give you a truly detailed glimpse into her nature."
2,Disappointing....a page skipper,"I always look forward to any new book written by Ms. Lindsey, and I have read all of her books. This book, and her last one were both slow, uninteresting, and completely out of character for her. I really miss the humor, excitement and well rounded characters of her older books."
4,I guess it was O.K.,"It wasn't as good as: ""Man of My Dreams"" or ""Once a Princess"", but it was much better than ""Say You Love Me""."
4,"Enjoyable, but not her best work.","In many of her sequel books, the storylines and characters are revisited in greater detail. This helps encourage interest in the previous books. I liked the way Lindsey made this book more of a heroine storyline instead of a hero. It shows people that just because a person is a woman does not mean that she isn't capable of doing anything she sets her mind to. I thought it was wonderful to have a tenderfoot (male) in the story, most of the time it is just the opposite. An intriging twist."
3,Eh... nice story,"Nice story... nothing breathtaking or amazing about it. I found Casey to be headstrong and spoiled... almost to the point of being a brat. She did improve near the end though and redeem herself a bit.What can I say about Damian? It took a long time for him to grow on me. Its like his character didn't really develop into much until the middle of the book. He seemed almost weak to me... with not much personality. But as with Casey, he redeemed himself near the end of the story.Their love story was sweet. They certainly didn't have the chemistry that Casey's parents had. And their developing relationship almost seemed secondary to their search for Damian's father's murderer.Slow start to the story, picked up in the middle and then slowed down again near the end. There were a couple great scenes, one including some fun in the river, which helped keep my interest. Overall a good book, but certainly not one I would read over and over again."
4,Good sequel to 'A Heart So Wild'!!!,"While I will admit to liking a Heart So Wild a little better than this one, I still found this book to be good. Not great, but good. Casey is kind of annoying, but, all in all I gave this book fours stars because I loved the storyline and Damien....need I say anything about this gorgeous hunk of man who can do anything!!!!! Read this book. You will like it, even if not as much as some of JL's other books."
2,Ho hum,"I agree with one of the other reviewers. Every time I pick up a Lindsey, in my heart I'm looking for another Captive Bride or Fires of Winter. This one was a VERY boring and vastly unbelievable story. But, when your're listening on cassette while driving to work, even marginal stories are OK. I was quite glad it was only 3 cassettes, however, so I can go on to better things."
2,"Not a keeper, that's for sure","I just finished this book and must say I'm glad I checked it out from the library instead of shelling out $22! This story was dry and uninteresting, and like another reviewer, I found myself skipping pages merely to get to the end faster. I have read better Lindsey books, and hope that her last couple of novels are not an indication that her good writing days are over."
3,It was okay.,"I had too much expectations for this book. I had hoped it would be as good as Chandos and Courtney's story, but alas, sequels are always just second rate. Anyhow, Lindsey is still the best and I'm looking forward on her forthcoming novels."
5,Crescent Shower Rod,"The crescent shower rod makes taking a shower a dream, because I no longer feel the shower curtain clinging to me. It makes your shower seem much bigger than it is. I love the new found space."
5,Live L.A. Forum Concert,"Picture this: early 70's a concert is advertised at the L.A. Forum for three groups, two lessor known bands called Yes and J. Geils to open for Ten Years After. By the time Ten Years After appeared to do the tracks on this album me and my mates were ready, OK maybe too ready, but what can I say. This is the album that Ten Years After just released and I'm telling you the album is great but in person, Ten Years After brought down what was left of the house after the opening acts. The Forum is still standing but what's holding it up, I can't say."
5,always 5 stars forTYA,"Not listed yet but when you see it ""Live at the Filmore East- 1970"" is a must buy. The mastering is absolutely unbelievable, sounds like it was live yesterday. Quite possibly the best I have heard. If you are into British Blues and Rock don't deny yourself the experience BUY."
4,More pop orientated,"This may have been there most successful album, due in part to the FM single ""i'd like to change the world"". I think TYA got away from their roots on this cd and became a little more mainstream. Good cd, but I think they made better."
4,Space is Timeless,"I agree with the favorable reviews here. I was an impressionable teen when this album came out, it made a deep impression, I'll tell you what. Not many albums come close and I've given them a lot of opportunity.What makes it different? It has a very clear tone. The bass and lead guitars carry the songs sparsely, like a virtuoso garage band. The band delivers in its prime, their confidence bursts through too. If you like Zepp's ""No Quarter"" with Page's eloquent solos, this LP may have inspired it."
5,"""TOTAL GENUINE AAA REMASTER""","All of us crazy ""music lovers"" are well aware of the constant availability of the ""Remastered"" discs. Many do not realize that a large amount of ""Remasters"" are just plain s**t. You could do MUCH better going for an original Japanese or German version. I'll tell ya from a lot of ""Listening Experience"" on ""A Space In Time"" that this BGO ""Genuine Remaster"" from Sound Recording Technology, Cambridge is just AMAZING. Super solid, smooth bass lines and crystaline highs. Nice clean high hat sound. Mids are great with a lot of keyboard presence and Alvin's licks are even MORE appreciated. VERY VERY good overall mix. I don't think I could have done any better. I've got a lot of spins with Alvin & Co. on this one, both Vinyl and regular Chrysalis production CD & THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT TO OWN. If you're trying to decide, DON'T bother on anything, but this BGO!!!!!!!! IMHO This CD belongs in the top 5 all time rock releases."
5,I love this album,Ten years after is a great band and their other albums are great too but this is my favorite album its great alvin lee is a great guitar player and leo lyons is a great bass player and the whole band is great also did you know leo lyons went on to produce the band UFO and what a great band they were anyways this albums rocks buy it while you can also buy undead shhh cricklewood green and watt all great albums and dont forget that ten years later played at woodstock in 1969 and played im going home alvin lee and the boys rocked that song great band check them out
1,This was their sellout album,You get old. You forget. This was the album where Ten Years After basically sold out to pop culture. They didn't go on much longer after this one. Any other Ten Years After album is better than this.
4,A solid showcase of Alvin Lee's talent,"This a great starter album for people looking to see what Ten Years After were all about. Alvin Lee's speed guitar on ""I'd Love to Change the World"" sends shivers down my spine every time I hear it and makes you consider if all that ""Clapton is God"" grafitti in London in the late 60's should have been changed to read ""Alvin is God."" Other noteworthy tracks on this album include the extended blues workout ""One of These Days,"" with its distorted, warbling harmonica, and ""Uncle Jam,"" a short swinging instrumental that displays Alvin Lee's jazz leanings. If you like this album, progress on to ""Cricklewood Green,"" TYA's other early 70's masterpiece."
5,Wistful reading,"This is one of those rare books where I felt genuinely sad to finish. As a bit of an armchair traveller whose never been all that attracted to packaged tours but too timid to engage in all out adventures, this is a humourous, wild, scary and easy to read way to partake in Ben and his mate's adventure in a tiny way.Fantastic read and glad Ben & Co made it out alive."
4,Special baby gift,Bought this for my niece during her first year of life. My sister loves nature & the ocean and I knew she would love this for her baby daughter.
3,Curioser and curioser!,"This is an unusual cd to say the least. Most of it sounds like an eight year old playing but then there are flashes of brilliance. So, sketchy quality wise but definitely interesting. You won't have anything else like it in your collection that's for sure, unless you have an eight year old child who plays the accordian and other assorted instruments!"
4,A good collection.,"Overall I liked this short story collection. Most of the stories are clever and well written.There are a couple of stories that consist of their authors getting up on a soap box and whining about how horrible the human race is, but for the most part the stories range from decent to excellent."
2,Quite Disappointing...,"I would just like to say that I am a huge fan of the Remote Control empire (Formly Media Ventures), so I was really looking forward to Steve Jablonsky's score for The Island. I had watched the simi-car chase on The Island website and I thought the music was great... I go to see the movie (not great) but the music was good... not Steamboy quality but good. I get the CD and nowhere on the CD is the awesome simi-car chase music!!!!! However, there is a ""Massive Vehicular Carnage"" track which is a hip-hop song with horrible lyrics that have nothing to do with MASSIVE VEHICULAR CARNAGE! The CD comes close to the music featured in the chase with the track ""Crazist Mess I've Ever Seen"" however it is edited heavily and doesn't match the music featured during the chase sequence. This CD is a great disappointment, however tracks like ""Renovatio"" and ""Starkweather"" helped things out. If your a fan of Jablonsky buy it, if not, save your money for something better."
2,Only one decent song,"There's only one coherent actual song on this CD. The rest is just a collection of sound effects and short music bits. If you want that one song, the nice one at the very end, fine, but it's too bad there aren't more like it. I think they could have done better. I remember liking the movie soundtrack a lot - I don't think it translates very well to CD, though."
3,does anyone know the name of the theme song in this moive?,throughout the movie the theme is played in the begining and towards the end when everyone comes out from under! does anyone know the name of the main soundtrack instrumental is? its kind of a hum with voices and great backround..if anyone knows please let me konw on this or my aim is [...]thanx~ Brian
4,Review -Friends of Old Time Music,"If you like folk music, bluegrass or blues, this is for you. A wide variety of this type of music is presented. All are the originals from 14 concerts that were presented in New York city from 1961-1965.The artists vary from Doc Watson to Mississippi John Hurt and include The New Lost city Ramblers, Bill Monroe and The Stanley Brothers.. Some of the recordings are now collectors items if you could find the originals.A great addition to any collection of old time music."
1,junk,MY DAUGHTER GOT THIS FOR HER BIRTHDAY! HALF THE MAGNETS WERE MISSING & THE REST FELL OUT THAT SAME DAY! SAVE YOUR MONEY! WE LOVE POLLY POCKET BUT FOR THE PRICE THINGS SHOULD BE MADE BETTER! THEY EITHER RIPE OR DON'T WORK RIGHT! WE ARE DONE BUYING POLLY POCKET.
5,Totally Cool to play with,"My daughter got this for Easter and we all love it!!! I read the other reviews and Im sorry theirs dont work properly, but ours works just like its supposed to.It is enginered so that you can only put the clothes on the thing one way....so that the front will always be in front, ect.So if they fall off, you know you put it on wrong. And then you lower the shute slowly and push Polly into the dressing room slowly till you hear a ""click"". That click is the clothes ""jumping"" onto the doll!!!! It is so Cool to watch!!!We took this to Grandmas house to show her and all the adults sat and played with it for hours.....our only disappointement was that we only had one Click-it Polly to play with!!!! But the regular polly's got to be the store owner, so we still got to play with them!This is probably the coolest Polly product out there. And we will definetly be buying more of the 'click-it' products to go with it."
4,My kids love it...,"Once we looked at the directions, we didn't have trouble getting the dressing room to work properly. My kids loved the magnetic clothing so much that we went out and bought two of the other playsets with some extra birthday money. From my perspective they are much easier than the regular Polly Pocket clothes - my kids can change the clothes themselves - without my having to do it for them. Now if only each piece came with some sort of GPS device so that I could locate all the little shoes, hair pieces, etc, that end up under furniture and in the couch cushions!!!"
2,watch out,"I bought my daughter the boutique one day and she loved it. It is really neat and she played with it all day long. When her daddy got home, she went to show him how it worked and he had discovered that the magnets had fallen out of some pieces. This was very upsetting since we just got it that day."
2,Fun... While It Lasts,"Our daughter enjoyed this toy very much, for a total of 4 days. Then, the mechanism that slides up and down (to do the ""magic"" of dressing the Polly Pocket) jammed in the ""down"" position... for good. Our daughter was quite distressed. She was using it VERY carefully (I was watching her when it died), so it did not fail due to misuse. I have worked on this thing for a couple of hours, without taking it apart (yet), all to no avail. There is no visible cause for why it's jammed, but at this point, it's nothing more than a frustrating piece of junk. If I get it fixed, or Mattel sends a replacement, I'll update my review if I can."
1,Dangerous tiny magnets!,"The tiny magnets embedded in many of the small accessories fall out! These magnets are small-very small. They are about the size of a small earing back. Now, if your idea of a safe toy is to let your 4 year old play with such things, then this toy is for you. Otherwise, steer clear of this unsafe product."
1,Sadly Disappointed,My daughter who is five saw the commercial for this toy and really wanted it so I bought it expecting it to work just as the commercial showed it. Well we were sadly disappointed. We put the doll into the dressing room and placed the clothes onto the spots where they belong. We pulled the thing to make the doll come out dressed and the clothes did not go onto her like they showed on the commercial. The dolls cannot stand up or bend. I wish this toy was made alot better. I must say on a positive note that the pieces to dress the dolls with are really cute and I love how they go onto the hangers. I would not have this toy around when small children are present because some of the pieces are REALLY TINY.
3,ummmm..i don't realy care,B-O-R-I-N-G-!-!-!MAN MAN MAN IT'S SO BAD THE CLOTHS DON'T STICK IT'S VERY VERY STIFFYOU CAN'T MOVE THE BODY! THE ONLY THING THATS COOL IS THE CLOTHS THAT WHEN YOU PUSH THE LITTLE TAB AND PUSH HER IN THE CLOTHS WILL STICK FOR ABOUT ABOUT.....49 SECONDS! DON'T WAST YOU MONEY!
2,Not fun,"Lots of problems. First, the dressing elevator doesn't work, for the Polly comes out undressed ever time, and her feet do not fit in the shoes. Second, the clothes rack can only hold three outfits, for if you put more on they stick together. Don't buy this toy, and just buy the basic pollys."
4,Cliking Cool,"This is a great toy!!! I got it for my 8th birthday and adored it!!! There are a few problems.You have to squeeze polly in the shoes, and you have to pull something, but other than that, it's awsome!!!!!!!!!!! It won't sit or move it's arms, but it is still cool!! You can't use it with normal polly, but you can use it with other Quik Clik polly!!! I would recemmend it for children over 5 or 6!!!! Have fun with it!!!! :)"
2,"Dressing Polly isn't exactly a ""snap""","I bought this for my Polly-crazy 7 year old. The kids were excited to try the toy out right away, but soon discovered that it was not as easy as the commercial makes it appear. (is anything?) Polly's clothes hang rather precariously from the ""changer"" by two very weak magnets. It can be difficult to keep the clothes in place long enough to push the changer into position. Polly has to be carefully adjusted into her shoes before pushing her into the changing room. Sometimes it takes a couple of tries before she comes out dressed. The kids didn't seem to mind the trial and error phase at first, but eventually gave up and just manually stuck Polly's clothes to her. Also, this toy doesn't work with the other Pollys you have at home. It requires the special magnetized doll.All in all, this seems like too much fuss and bother just to dress a doll."
1,yuck...,"This doll is a rip-off! My little sister got this for her birthday. There is only 1 doll that can wear the clothes and get them on. She cannot move! She can't sit in the car, stand up, or wear most of any of the other Polly clothes. The Quik Click thing is just stupid. It takes a less amount of time to just put the clothes on manually! And more than 3/4 of the time the clothes don't go on! The commercial is a lie. The clothes don't go on so fast and you have to reload-it doesn't do it itself. Worst of all, my little sister accidently dropped it and guess what? More than half of the clothes are broken! Do they EVER test toys anymore?"
2,"Cute Concept, but is dissapointing.","The set is cute, but you have to click the clothes on by hand. When I did the thing, Polly came out with the front of her dress on her head! I don't really recomend it unless you think the front of a dress on your head is a good look."
2,It's.........................ok.........,"This polly toy is b.o.r.i.n.g.. The doll is sooooooooooo stiff. You cant move her legs or arms if you do, they break! The clothes don't stay on, either!! The only cool thing about it is you roll the doll in the dressing room, pull her out, and the clothes are on her! I saw the commercials, and it does look cool! But, don't let those fool you, the toy stinks! Don't buy this toy!!!"
2,"Daughter wasn't able to get it to work, then it broke","My daughter was very excited about this toy but could not get it to work. Even I got very frustrated trying to line everything up and use just the right amount of pressure to get it to work. After just a few uses, the ramp jammed, and the toy now no longer works at all. And when we could get the doll dressed, my daughter was frustrated that the clothes pop off so easily, and she really couldn't play with her since she can't bend. Overall extremely frustrating for both of us."
3,My daughter likes it,"I bought this after my daughter's 7th Birthday. She likes Polly Pocket and had a previous set. It jammed the 1st day probably my 4 year olds fault as he can be rough. We had her 2 hours and her head fell off. The magnetic clotes fall off. Since jammed cannot close the toy properly. I keep all the clothes and accessories in container with lid(choking hazord for little sister). My daughter still likes to play with it does everything manually. I called the company the next day(1-800 number) and they sent me a replacement Polly for this set as well as sent me replacement for the Polly(who was smaller and magnetic as well, who also broke)from the previously purchased set. Great customer service so give them a call with problems. This is my 1st complaint with their products and I have lots of their products in my home. I am hesitant to purchase more sets though with Polly(my daughter wants them for Christmas)."
5,Reprint,"This 2002 ""edition"" appears to be a reprint of the 1995 revised edition.I did some spot checks between the two. The additional pages in the 2002 ""edition"" are due to a larger font that was used for printing.The usefulness of this work is not diminished by the 2002 reprint. I have been searching for a how-to for an English speaker and this is the best book I found."
1,A poorly researched genealogical guide for Swedish research,"I read this book from cover-to-cover and examined every sourceused. I donot recommend this book for use as a tool for finding Swedish ancestry. The card catalog at the Family History Library in Salt Lake City, Utah or at any of its branch libraries would be more helpful."
2,Very mediocre...,"I am amazed at the reader comments here. I picked this book up immediately after reading ""Gideon"", which was totally trashed by many reviewers, and couldn't even bring myself to go past the first 100 pages. Many ""cozy"" mysteries are written better than this. The characters are weak, the plot is non-existent, and the writing is just plain bad."
5,A stunning page turner!!,"Oh my gosh! This book was sooo good!!! Everyone told me not to start reading this book on a work night(we are all thriller addicts), but no, I wouldn't listen. It was two a.m. and I kept looking at the clock, thinking I have got to get some sleep, but I couldn't put Every Trace down. This is a great book with one of the best bad guys since Hannibal... Take this book with you on vacation; do not start it on Sunday night.Exhausted, Terrified, and Wrung Out in Texas"
3,their were stronger songs he could have used.,"i have all the david lee roth albums and was really expecting a new album out. it's been some time now since the release of ""your filthy little mouth"". as a collection, there were some songs i didn't agree on. oh well, even the best of van halen had the same problem. it's not bad. some of it was just a waste of space."
4,Cd old music,It was a nice Cd. I bought it for one song and the others were ok. I am glad that I got the cd and the music on it.
1,"once a hack, always a hack","David Lee Roth has always been a talentless hack. Putting together a ""best of"" compilation of his work is a little like trying to pick the best things about having a root canal. If you are even considering buying this recording, it shows you are probably in need of professional counselling."
3,Good collection of songs.,"This is a nice and listenable collection of songs from David Lee Roth. All of the tunes are in a straight-ahead rock musical direction. There is a total of twenty songs on this hits package. The lyrics to all of the tunes are included in the liner notes. The liner notes also include a few photographs. There's a song that is especially recorded for this compilation, too. The rest of the tracks are from his first five albums. The tunes that I like the most are ""Just like Paradise"" and ""Stand Up."" David Lee Roth is an entertaining and lively vocalist. This hits collection is enjoyable and worth a listen."
2,Poor quality product,"Both Mascara Flextencils were very dry. I am wondering if the products sent via Amazon.com are old products sent back by stores after the expiration date.Most likely, I will not order these again on Amazon.com."
2,overestimated,"Although the book gives many projects, most of the information on ""how to"" is vague. Many projects require using and mixing colorants rather than using latex paint. NOT for anyone without some professional training."
5,Great!,"The products recommended in this book are different, and easy to use. I have been able to use oil-painting techniques (transparency, longer drying time, etc.) using water-based paints, and the clean-up time is almost non-existent. Latex paint is a thing of the past!"
5,Great CD to introduce children to folk music!,"With all the mediocre or product-pandering commercial music for kids out there, this was such a relief. My 4-year-old loves it, thinks that sound Woody Guthrie makes in ""Riding in the Car"" is a scream, knows all the words to the songs, and it's introduced her (and me) to some great traditional folk songs. Highly recommended."
5,A Wonderful Sampling of Children's Music,"This cd samples several different styles of children's music, from lullabies to calypso beats and in between. This a wonderful way to engage your child in moving to rhythm and share a part of American History with them. Our infant music class dances and sings to some of the songs on this cd collection. To truly enjoy this cd get up and move with your children to the music. Pretend to drive a car when you hear ""Ridin' in the Car"" or pretend to be a big lumbering elephant while dancing to ""Mary Mack""."
1,Not fit for me,"I have a different style of spira walking shoes and they have worked good for me. They are comfortable and have nice lateral support. However, this style has a sort of bump at the toe area. I think the bump is supposed to fit under your toes. I had to re-order these three times because the bump kept hitting on the ball of my foot. Really uncomfortable. Gave me pain."
3,Mixed bag for mixed last foot,"I've had these for about 8 months. I have bad feet that are wide in the front, but no where else. I found that I needed to size up and still lace the bottom laces so they didn't pull at the front.For the first 5 months, with an added gel heel pad and orthodics, they were fine once I got used to walking in them - the sole is a bit strange. Now either my feet changed or the shoe stretched and my toes are sliding into the front/side of the shoe, causing a lot of pain. BTW, the rocker sole is supposed to reduce pressure on the forefoot, which I don't find to be the case at all.So, overall, I found that they ran narrow in front and I'm not sure what the spring does or doesn't do. However, my feet are so hard to fit that finding a shoe that works for a few months is really all I can hope for."
4,great for work,"I bought these shoes for a new job as a c.s. technician at a local hospital. I broke them in the first day at my old job at a salon. after 2 hours my feet started to ache. that lasted about another 2 or 3 hours, then I guess my feet got used to the shoe, because they havent hurt since. I bought them strictly for working at the hospital, and they really do help take the pressure off of my feet. but, If my new job would have allowed, I would have continued to wear my most comfey,clunky,ugly,roomy,old crocks. I gave these shoes a 4 because my feet get really hot working in them. overall Id say I think these shoes are one of the best to suit the feild of work im in now. but I really do miss my crocks!"
1,"So, Very Disappointed!","I wanted a pair of shoes that I could wear for extended period knowing that I would be doing alot of standing and walking. From time I put these shoes on I knew that I was going down hill. But the reviews from other customers was so wonderful, that I thought well maybe it's just me. So, I decided to were them to a day long festival. I would have walked barefoot back home,if i could have. These shoes are so very uncomfortable and they feel that like they were not properly made. However I did not return them in the 30 days and reading other customers complaints I realize that I am just out of luck. So, please if you do decide to order these shoes and feel that they are not right for you,listen to yourself and execise your right to return them before it is too late.Sadly, stuck with another pair of shoes!"
4,Very happy,"A good shoe...I'm happy with it. The iternal springs make it even more comfortable. A little pricey, but worth it."
5,Really pleased with these shoes,"I was very hesitant to invest this much money in a pair of shoes, but I'm glad I did. I work in the ER and I am sometimes on my feet a lot. I had tried New Balance for several years, but even those shoes that were designed for arch support were inadequate. With the Spiras I no longer have to use arch support insoles. While I can't say that all of my plantar fasciitis pain is gone, it is very much improved. Don't expect an improvement immediately, it's taken a month for my feet to adjust to the shoes and for my pain to improve. Also be aware that these shoes run a little wide. I ordered a wide width shoe, however Amazon mistakenly shipped me a regular width shoe. After a month, however, the shoe feels fine. Initially my right pinkie toe was feeling a little squished (apparently the right is my wider foot), however now the shoes fit very comfortably."
4,Very Comfy,These walking shoes are very comfortable. Like walking on a cloud. The only downfall is that my first two pair (purchased elsewhere)wore out on the bottom within a few months. I feel that the price was quite high for something that doesn't last very long.
2,not very durable,"I would think for the price, this shoe would have lasted longer than it did. I purchased this pair of shoes in January. Seeing as how I live in the Northeast and we get plenty of snow, they were not worn daily. Then spring and summer time arrived and sandles became prevalent. I have worn these shoes maybe about 5 months out of the 8 months I've owned them, and the material/cushion on the inside of the shoe has worn away in certain spots. I am not a person to hike, run (on the road or on a track), take fitness classes, etc... These shoes were not over worn. It's just the quality that lacks duribility. I will not spend this kind of money on a substandard shoe again~"
2,they don't flex at toes,"Great except for one very important problem: They don't flex at all in the toe region. I wore them around the house and my first MTP joints started smarting after about an hour. Toe flexibility is very important! I returned them without any problems there, and that's why I'm giving them two stars."
1,Defective Shoe,"I am an avid walker, 5-6 miles a day, and have worn many brands of walking and training shoes. I decided to purchase these Spira shoes based on online reviews in May 2010. My initial impression was very good and I rated the shoes this way. However, I was recently wearing the shoes and the left one became very noisy. I thought I picked up a little stone in the shoe. Kept walking. Then the shoe started a low pitched squeek. When I got home I discovered a 3"" x 1/4"" hole in the sole of the left shoe, exposing a metal plate. I have never experienced this problem after wearing walking shoes for such a short period of time, and have returned them for a full refund. Perhaps my shoe was defective and this is not a reflection on Spira. But I will not purchased this brand again."
2,Not what they're cracked up to be,"They are nothing more than any other shoe that I've bought at a local shoe store for half the money. They really aren't anything special to warrent the price. Although they fit my narrow feet well, I can't be truely happy with them. My knees still hurt after work every day and the inside isn't as comforting as they were promised to be. There is no spring action that I can feel, but I can surely hear the squeek with every step I take. My advice is save the money! These shoes are not worth this price!!!"
2,Not A Good Looking Shoe,I ordered this shoe for a trip to Ireland. I was disappointed because it didn't look like the picture. It had no heel and look like an orthopedic shoe. I'm sure it was comfortable but it wasn't appealing to me. I went to DSW and got a very good walking sneaker that suited my needs for comfort and attractiveness in a shoe.
3,Springs hurt,"When I first got these they were fine...but after a few months of almost daily use they have gotten so uncomfortable I can't wear them. First, the shoe comes up very high on the foot, resting right under the ankle bone. I was willing to tolerate this although this by itself was a bit uncomfortable. But oh, the springs in the forefoot area now feel like they are going to poke holes in my feet! Even placing additional padding over them did not help. I'll stop wearing them for awhile and maybe try in a few months to see if it was just my feet, but for now they are decomissioned."
1,Poor quality and bad service.,"I ordered a pair of the womens wavewalkers for work, since i had heard they were great shoes, they were somewhat comfortable but within just a few days started coming apart. and the customer service is horrible after 2 months I am still trying to get my money back!! Dont waste your time!! will only buy Saucony from now on!!"
3,Spira springs need more bounce,"A nice shoe with good spring when you first wear it. They run a little on the larger of your size when ordering a wide width. I am not sure that the spring makes that much difference compared to rocker type shoes, but they are okay. I found them to add a little stress to the ankle."
3,Not For Travel,"I bought these Spira Women's Classic Leather Walking Shoes to take with me on a trip to Europe last summer. I put them on in Brooklyn the night before we boarded the Queen Mary 2 to cross the Atlantic on July 6. They were my only pair of shoes during the entire ten-day voyage to Hamburg with a stopover in Southampton for a shore excursion to Stonehenge, Salisbury Cathedral, and the New Forest. They were also my only pair of shoes during our ten-day Germany/Austria car trip. I really put the shoes to the test with all the walking we did, especially in Weimar where we couldn't drive the car anywhere and had to walk everywhere (Think of Colonial Williamsburg in Germany).Then I wore them back across the Atlantic to New York. By then I had to get new shoes! The pair I wore to Europe lasted me only one month."
4,Good performance but mediocre recording.,"Drake's performance is very good, though I hesitate to say excellent since the recording was done poorly. There is so much reverberation that it is hard to hear some of the finer nuances of these works, many of which are workhorses of the harp repertoire."
2,OK read but not much insight into becoming a trader.,"By turns humorous, vulgar, scatological and even touching, I found that I learned more about the author and his love for his wife that I did about trading. An interesting read, but don't expect to learn much about how to trade the markets from the book."
4,A great read!,"As a professional trader I am always looking for the ""edge"". This book is weak on actual trading methodologies. But I really enjoyed hearing about his daily life and routines as a trader. Especially what it's like when things go against you as they eventually will if you are in this game long enough.I had trouble putting the book down. Highly recommended.Woops, just got a fill, gotta go!"
3,marty and the pitbull,Entertaining but short on helpful tips for traders. He has apparently taken great care not to give any methodological tips apart from broad guidelines. The guy is clearly very good. I would like to read a book where he gives specific methodologies with examples. Do his methods work in the current market ? How did he gain confidence in his methods since this was in the pre-system testing software days ! Since he has apparently taken 100 million out of the markets and his financial future and that of his family is secure. He should write the definitive book on short term trading...and upstage a similar book by Larry williams. How about it Mr Schwartz ?Summary An interesting read but only limited use to the budding trader. It falls short on trading specifics and the limited technical info is potentially misleading. I take off my hat to a master trader but write that ultimate trading book SO WE CAN TAKE OFF OUR HATS TO A MASTER TRADING AUTHOR
2,Difficult to Read,"A good way to describe this book might be to say that it is what /Reminiscence of a Stock Operator/ would have been like had Philip Roth written it.Many times while I was reading this, I had to look at the back cover and reread Ace Greenberg's quote: ""Buzzy Schwartz is a winner....All else is nonsense."" Because this book is so full of insipid nonsense, you might forget Schwartz is, in fact, a winner.I suggest checking it out at the library and reading only the last two chapters, which actually have something in them that could be called ""lessons"". (Please note the title of this book.) Forget the rest, it's nonsense. Like many other reviewers here have said, there is no system on a silver platter. Take what you can find and do your own research.Whatever you decide, realize that no great trader would ever ""need"" this book, certainly not for its ""psychological insights"". Buzzy wouldn't have, at least."
1,"A egotist says ""Look at me! I am great""","The title is deceiving. The book reveals little to the reader about how to be a better trader. It's a catchy title, but the real purpose of the book was to satisfy the immature ego of this admittedly great trader.For someone who had $ as his single target, he protests and cries aligator tears when the investors in his hedge fund pulled out because they were concerned about the safety of THEIR money. ""They abandoned me""... like we're supposed to have sympathy on him because an illness prevented him from achieving his fantasy of being ""the biggest and the best"". He compares himself with George Soros!I hated this book because I couldn't get past my revulsion of the self-aggrandizing author."
1,Pit Bull Lessons from Wall Street's Champion Day Trader,"Not funny as some reviews state. No real inside information on trading. Certainly , no comparison to ""Liar's Poker"". The trade in value last week was .61 cents. This week it's .52 cents. Short this book.Harper must be a vanity publisher. And to think three people collaborated on this book.Anyone wishing to read this can find a free copy in my recycle bin this week."
2,not worth more than 5 bucks,"This book was mildly entertaining. His story is akin to reading an autobiography written by a drunk sailor. This guy is not much of a writer, and his story is a common one. The book is about a trader finding out who he is. He's mostly writing to himself, not you. The book is like a journal. ""I just couldn't stop doubling up ! I...I...I was killing myself, oh no my wife wouldn't call to bail me out ! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH !!!! You must have discipline ! You need discipline !"" hahahaha....How many times have you (if you're a trader) heard crap like that ? Same old song and dance that you read in almost any trading book...nothing profound or enlightening, and you will not learn anything. You never learn much of anything in trading until you've lived as a trader."
5,Great read,"Martin ""Buzzy"" Schwartz bares his soul on the ups and downs he has encountered as a trader. Like the books ""Market Wizards"", I couldn't seem to put it down. If you are looking for the holy grail in technical analysis, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a very entertaining read about the trading life, this is the book for you. He gives you the emotions involved, along with some sound tidbits on money management. I trade in the markets for a living, and truly enjoyed his candor...you will too."
4,Entertaining and insightful,"This book pretty much tells the story of a trader named Marty Schwartz. It describes how he got started trading and evolved into what Barron's called a master trader. There was a lot of ""ego"" to read about and I almost stopped reading but the story got better. Instead of spending the whole book telling me how smart he was, he started talking about some trades that didn't go so well too. I actually learned from him as he described his errors and how he recovered. It helped me reduce my ""pig"" factor when I day trade. There was some humor in the book too which kept it fun to read.So, this book isn't a how to book but it does indirectly give you some good advice to use in your trading. Its worth reading, I enjoyed it."
5,It can be done!,"I found this book to be great. It does not provide any strategies, but I do not think it matters. I consider Martin to be a role model, he accomplished what I am trying to do right now. ""Pit Bull"" gives inspiration to traders and proves that it can be done."
5,What a fun book!,THe author just told his story (and what a great story it was). He just told us what he did and how it turned out. No claims that his way was the best way. No claim that everyone elses method stink. Just letting us know what worked (very well I must add) for him.Take a day and read this book.
3,"I think that ""Buzzy"" is a bit full of himself.","Although the anecdotes of Wall St. traders are interesting to those who follow the markets, Buzzy milks his pain for all that it's worth. After all, this is the life he chose, and I'm supposed to feel sorry for a guy who makes more in a day than most (including me) do in a year?He makes some excellent points about the discipline required to day trade the way he does and I think the book is definitely required reading (although maybe a bit down the list) for students of the market.I think Audrey deserves a medal for putting up with this guy. Yeah, they have all the money they need, but what kind of life do they lead? He minimizes the fights they must have over his lack of attention of his family in order to persue his goals."
3,a recreational read but a bit meandering,"This is a well written and fun book, but it's a little too meandering to add a lot of value to traders. It's short on application and long on story. Marty is profiled in Schwager's original Market Wizards text which is probably sufficient to grasp Marty's style. I would only recommend this as a light recreational read to a trader that has burned through most of the other texts on trader profiles or just needs a break from the more laborious texts that focus on application and methods in trading."
2,No Citations,"Overall, Conservatize Me was all right. I did enjoy John Moe's side of The Experiment and found it somewhat enlightening to see the what Moe portrays as the thoughts of a liberal. The humor was not always funny and many times acidic towards topics Moe strongly disagreed with (like religion). I did notice something important in regards to the integrity of the book. There are no citations. There are footnotes, but they are Moe's additional thoughts. There are mentions of media outlets and events, such as ""The Washington Post said blah blah"" or ""Dick Cheney was involved in blah blah,"" but no citations of any events, interviews, news articles, or anything. None. So in regards to being considered a valid source, Conservatize Me is not a valid source for anything. I recommend keeping that in mind when reading this book and before accepting anything in the book as truth.Due to the validity of the book I took a star off my rating."
3,"Cool Graphics, Disappointing quality","My son was so excited to choose this theme for his room and I was equally excited until I received the package. The graphics are very cool, without a doubt, and I knew the sheets would be thin, as are all his character sheet sets. The problem is that the fitted sheet in the packaging is a TWIN sized sheet and the rest of the items are correct as marked, for a full size bed . I returned the first set hoping it was just a mistake but my replacement arrived with a full size comforter, full size flat sheet, two pillowcases and a TWIN size fitted sheet. I had already promised my son this bedding as a treat for his new room in our new home. I'm keeping the set and will make a valance with the fitted sheet. Very disappointed."
4,Review,"This is another great supplement to the book the Infetility Cure. The book itself has a lot of information, but if you are not familiar with yoga and accupressure it is difficult to follow in the book. The video provides much more detail in where and how to apply the accupressure and the yoga is also very informative. I would recommend this to anyone following Randine Lewis' fertility plan. Good luck to you. I pray for all of the women struggling with infertility every day."
3,Thank you Rachel,"As a grateful fan of Rachel Carson I was a little underwhelmed by this biography. Paul Brooks was a close co-worker and friend and as such could offer some personal perspectives that others probably could not. However, my expectation was that I would learn a lot about her journey as a writer and activist, which was somewhat addressed, but it contained many, many excepts from her works before ""Silent Spring""."
4,Civil war brought to life,"The book is based on one of the quirks of history, that the civil war started on and ended on the property of a single man... even after he had moved over a hundred miles to get away from the war. While much of the specifics of the central family the book covers is fictional, its all based on historical realities and the book is DENSE with historical details not only of the civil war but of America in general during that period. It mentions pretty much everything, from the expansion of the railroads, the oppression of mill workers in the north, to Jenny Lind the opera singer.While Rinaldi is not the best writer by a long shot, her books do tend to be rich with historical detail"
5,Extremely well written! An extraordinary read!!,The book followed history extremely accurately and it was very good. The characters were well defined and Oscie Mason was an amazingly lively character. The book was VERY good and it is highly suggestedto anyone who likes historical fiction.
5,Ann Rinaldi is a great writer,Ann Rinaldi's books are perfect for me . She writes about the things I want to read about .This book is about a family in the Civil War . Ann Rinaldi's mixof real history and fiction is spectacular! I highly recommend any of her books !I have all of them and am looking forward to April 1st!
5,A Wonderful Civil War Saop Opera That Happens To Be True,"I absoultely loved this book! I am a great fan of Civil War Literature, fiction and non-fiction alike. I had this book for a long time before I actually decided to read it, and once I was done I wondered how I could have waited so long. The characters are so realistic that they seemed like dear friends. If you are an emotional person you will most likely find yourself bawling your eyes out in various places throughout the book. I had heard the basic story of the book before, but never has it portrayed in such a moving and entertaing way. Ann Rinaldi has done such wonderful research that it almost seems like you're actually there in those turbulent years."
4,An enjoyable read!,"In My Father&#65533;s House was a very enjoyable read. Oscie Mason is a headstrong young girl growing up around the time of the American Civil War. She lives in Manassas, Virginia. Her father has died and her mother is remarrying. Her new stepfather, Will McLean, and Oscie are constantly at battle. With the tension growing between the South and the North, this novel brings in a historical aspect to an exciting and gripping story. The characters are developed well, so the reader is drawn into the plot. I felt like I could relate with the characters. There are also personal conflicts as the characters struggle with themselves, what is right, and romance. A slave named Mary Ann causes many problems in the household, and Oscie is determined to get rid of her any way possible. With the oncoming war, Will McLean wants to move his family away from danger. They move to a quiet town called Appottomax. I found this book very pleasing and hard to put down!"
3,interesting if you like reading about the civil war,I personally thought this book was a bit confusing. The main character is Oscie and she matures during the war. The main plot is for her step father to safely put her family away from the war. There is a lot of moving about but that adds up to the main plot of the story. Many people show Oscie the way to mature and finally she finds someone who cares for her a lot.
2,A boring book,"I read this book, and I don't feel that it is very good. It drags through most of the story, with only a few interesting parts. The ending is okay. I didn't like it, and I won't be reading it again. I think this is one of Ann Rinaldi's boring books. If you want to read a good Ann Rinaldi book, read Time Enough for Drums, or The Fifth of March."
4,Compelling Novel,"This is one of Ann Rinaldi's best works. In My Father's House is a informational, yet exciting, hisotrical fiction novel. This novel is about a girl called Oscie. Oscie and her family are living during the Civil War. Many things have impacted Oscie's life, her father's death, her stepdad, and a woman named Mary Ann. Oscie doesn't realize it, however she is growing up during the war, in love and life. Oscie additionally doesn't realize that she is becoming a wise woman during this time of war. Oscie is learning when to state her opinion and when to hold her fire. In My Father's House is a excellent well-written manuscript. I recomend this to all mature readers.Jerry"
4,Begin Here1,"Irwin Schiff is forgotten by many, these days, but he was among the first in the recent era to call into the question the fundamental legitimacy of many governmental branches we all to casually now ""take for granted."" The analysis of the Social Security System presented here uses copies of the Agency's OWN enabeling legislation to CLEARLY demonstrate the much of what you think you know, ""Jusy ain't so!""Schiff must also be held up as an examplar of ""Walking your talk"" having done time in Federal Prison for sticking to his guns, and his positions. If you're a fan of Larken Rose, you'll find an idealogical ""ancestor"" here. His other works ""The Biggest Con"" and ""How An Economy Grows and Why It Doesn't"" are other eye-openers well worth finding. Good Hunting all!"
2,It's just not that good,"As other 2-star reviewers have mentioned, this book is extremely simple and basic in its treatment of scientific writing. Really, to write well you need: practice and correct English beaten into you.Does cover how editors handle your paper, and that's really the only detailed section, the whole book could then be around 30 pages. If you wrote a paper on the computer in high school with a graph or picture, circa 1998, you were more technologically advanced than several of the sections in the book, most scientists were ahead of that."
4,Warning to Engineering professionals,"I purchased this book to help improve my techincal writing skills. Something that engineering professionals should be aware of before purchasing this book is that it is quite geared towards scientific journals and NOT engineering journals. The formats presented within do not match the standards of the journals and conferences that we submit to in my research group. However, the general advice that is given about writing is extremely useful and the scientific world would be a better place if every single professional spent a few days studying it.I believe there is a separate edition available for Engineering disciplines."
4,Good shopping place for Books,Good Book for English scientific paper writing.Safe and good web-shop.International dilivery is not as quick as imagined.
5,The ultimate guide for scientists who want share ideas.,"I was acquainted with Robert Day's How to Write and Publish a Scientific Paper during my post graduate years. Only the fourth edition was available then. I have since continually recommended it to all people in my scientific circles. Now that I am involved in helping budding scientists take their first steps in research, I use Day's book as my bible. Most of the undergraduate students that have come by me have been exposed to this handy reference, and I believe that through Day's book third world science can actually level up to our first world counterparts."
2,too basic to be helpful,"It's good to know how an editor think about the scientific writing, but practically the book is not helpful if you want to learn writing rather than editing. The author has never written scientific papers by himself. He has no idea how to orgnize the data and make a convincing story.I have read many beautiful scientific papers in prestigeous journals. How come those authors have not written a book??Also Day's book is too old. Now day nobody would like to draw graphs if there is software available."
3,A little of everything,"This book gives some interesting background information and gives synopsis of several different types of toilet training. I like the way the author focuses on positive aspects. However, there doesn't seem to be much in the way of new content - it feels more like a longish magazine article than a ""Guide to Successful, Stress-Free Toilet Training."" All in all this book has not been a huge help, but contains enough tidbits that I've picked it up a couple of times."
3,Good phones but poor quality,"I recently bought the i5866 DSS Expandable Cordless Phone with Digital Answering System and six handsets. I have a 5 level split level home with only one servicable phone jack. I also run a standard G Wireless Lan in the home. The router for the lan is in the basement and the phone is situated on the next floor up.I don't really know if the router was the cause of the problem but all but one of the phones (located on every level of the house) transmitted garbled speech. The sound coming in to the phones was fine, but no-one could understand what we were saying back. Also one of the phones would not recharge it's batteries. I returned the lot."
3,Not good for wireless networks.,I rejected this phone because it uses both 5.8 ghz and 2.4 ghz frequencies and thus can interfere with 802.11 WIFI b and g type networks.
4,operates at both 2.4GHz and 5.8 Ghz,"I don't want to start a big argument here, but despite what Mr Rusty H. Hodge said previously, the VTech i5866 phone does apparently operate at both 2.4GHz and 5.8 Ghz, AT THE SAME TIME. The handset transmits on 2.4 GHz and receives on 5.8 GHz. The base unit is just the opposite. You'll find this info on page 44 of the owner's manual, which you can download from Amazon or VTech."
4,great for broad-minded people,"If you want your children to have exposure to other traditions, this CD is for them. Most of this CD (and many other Ella Jenkins) CDs sounds like it was recorded at an awesome library singalong for young children.There is a maudlin version of ""Holiday Times"" sung by a male voice. You can enjoy it because it's ""so bad it is good,"" but it seems out of place here. You can always skip it."
4,The Dangerous Skies by A.E Clouston,"This is a relation of mine of whom I don't know much about but after reading this book I have found that this Kiwi must have been one of, if not, the best pilot of his time.If you are into your combat aircraft, then this is a must book to read and have. By the time that you have finished this book you will be amazed at how great this man was.If you happen to know anyone that is realated to this man (A.E Clouston) can you please get hold of me via email (mental_pillock@hotmail.com)"
5,Guacamole flavored tortilla chips,"These chips taste just like the real thing. You used to be able to buy them at Sams Club, and various grocery stores, but it would seem this is the last place to get them. They are very tasty. You would love them if you love avocado."
2,My box was pretty stale.,"Originally got a full size bag of these at SAMS and they were very good. Unfortunately, these individual pkgs are not up to the same freshness. Taste stale and much harder. Look for something else."
4,My review after 1 year use,"I am doing master's in electrical eng., this book was good for me. But I think this is not a good starting point to understand the theory of the communication systems. I advice this book to at least master's degree people, since it gives all theory about a topic (e.g. Phase-Shift Keying) in one section including introduction, theory, implimentation and application. So, you are really expected to know some basics in communication theory already. It covers both analog and digital communication theory, but it's really good especially in digital. It uses generally analogy between analog and digital. Thus, it can't be used as a reference book easily. To understand this book, you must put a lot of effort and time to it. If you really wanna know these stuff (given in table of contents), it's worth to buy.Thanks for reading."
3,pieces,i thought it wood have been smaller but its pretty big the only thing is that they sent everthing except the bolts
3,"Pretty sweet ramp, but a few things could be better...","The Good:-Sturdy steel frame.-Durable ramp surface.-Fits in the back of any truck or SUV for easy transportation.-Easy to put together.The Bad:-My ramp only came with half of the parts needed to fully assemble, but after calling Mojo Rails, they immediately shipped out my parts with 2 day shipping.-The exposed allen head screws on top of the ramp rust immediately if exposed to moisture.-The ramp doesn't have any rubber grips on the bottom to prevent sliding.-The price is a bit steep."
3,"Solid Ramp - Size is 30"" by 45""","This is a solid ramp, and the polycarbonite surface is excellent.NOTE: As of March 10, 2009 the product description given stated the ramp was four feet by six feet. In fact, the ramp is 30 inches by 45 inches. I have contacted Amazon about this difference; hopefully, they have corrected this error. Thus, keep in mind that the ramp is substantially smaller than the description given (and thus may not be such a good value overall)."
1,Don't waste your money,"I had this shipped twice as the first one was the wrong size and the second when I started to assemble it, I stopped as it was smaller than I thought and didn't seemed to be built well at all."
1,More false than fact.,This book had more opinion and poorly researched material than any true crime book I've ever read. Weir is one of the few who believe that John Dillinger did not die that day at the Biograph and this is just one of many silly statements in this book.
4,Better than I expected,"Maybe it's because I wasn't expecting a whole lot when I bought this book. I picked it on a whim to read while traveling. I especially like being able to read one story, stop, pick the book up later and read another. Fewer interruptions are likely to happen when I read this way. The stories are in chronological order and unfold a bit of history. Some very interesting facts, and probably little known to the average person, are revealed. I truly enjoyed this book."
2,Not the original hits,"These are remakes! I wish they had advertised it as such, i wouldn't have bought it otherwise! I thought it might be too good to be true for the great price."
4,"OK, not KO","*****! When you gotta catch 'em all, you need this Book! By the way, my Meweye is doing great, and my Blastoize is at level 100!"
3,Galileo 7-21x25 Compact Zoom Binoculars,Easy to use but focus at mult. magnifications doesn't work to make a clear picture unless you use only one eye. Not recommended for the price.
2,OK somewhat,"I returned this item after trying it out for a few days. The construction quality of the item is good, but the optics are not up to par. There is quite a lot of optical distortion at all levels and, when zoomed, I can't get the thing focused clearly. I was very disappointed. I spent more and got the Nikon Eagleview and really like it. It's much much better."
3,Secret of the Andes,"Secret of the Andes is the story of Cusi, a young Incan boy who lives in a remote valley in the Andes. He has been raised and taught by Chuto in the traditional Inca manner to herd llamas. Set four hundred years after the Spanish conquest, Cusi is one of the few remaining of royal Inca blood. As Cusi grows, he discovers an Indian family living in the valley over. By watching them, he realizes his desire for a family of his own. Eventually, he leaves Chuto to find a family, only to discover that he already had what he wanted all along. The plotline moved a bit slowly and tended to be repetitious. Consequently, I believe it would be hard for a child to maintain interest throughout the entire book."
2,It was a little slow for me,"I read this book aloud to my children. It won the 1953 Newbery Medal.This story is about an Incan boy named Cusi, who lives in a hidden valley in the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is a lonely life for him, with only an older man named Chuto and the pack of llamas that they care for as companions. A wandering minstrel comes to the valley one day, and he notices the golden ""earplugs"" (a spool-shaped ornament that made of gold that is inserted into the earlobe to stretch it) in Cusi's ears and comments that the legends are true. Cusi has no idea what he is talking about, and he does not realize that his golden earplugs are a symbol of royal blood. Because he lives in seclusion on the mountain, he does not come into contact with other boys and does not realize that he is different.Cusi eventually learns more about his culture and heritage. I generally enjoy books of this nature, but this book was a little slow for me.MY RATING: 2 stars! Meh, it was just ""ok."""
4,beautifully written,"This book is gorgeously written, and if kids will sink into the pace, which is slow, they can get a great lesson in the power of language. I wouldn't recommend it much below 4th grade, and I found when I read to my 9 year old that it really helped having some pictures of Peru, the Andes, and llamas. The mid-section of the book gets downright mystical and it can be a little hard to follow; please stick it out. A fabulous addition to any story on the conquest of Peru, or for that matter any story about conquest. Brief side note: I found the best way to communicate the feelings of being a ""conquered"" people to my daughter was to have her imagine if aliens took over Earth. Why would it be important to preserve your culture in that situation? Give it a shot."
4,"Small, but lovely story","Secret of the Andes is a quiet story of an Inca boy growing up in the mountains of Peru, raising llamas. This boy, Cusi, knows little of his past, and has no home other than the mountains, no family outside his elderly mentor and his llamas.Time passes and Cusi knows he must leave the mountain, leave his llamas, leave his mentor, and go to the city to seek out his heart's desire. Will he find this heart's desire? And, if he does, will it be what he thought it would be?A wonderful little story of the seeking and finding of simple happiness in a big world."
3,Secret of the Andes,Secret of the Andes is an okay book some parts were really good but other parts are not so good. I liked reading it because even though the book was set in present time you still feel like it is set in the past.The story is about a boy who is looking for a family but does not realize he had one until the end of the book. My favourite part in the book was when Cusi found out about the truck.I did not like the ending because it did have alot of action if I was Ann I would have changed the ending by Chuto secretly giving Misti as a sacrifice then Cusi being so sad that he runs offto his dad and has a happy life with his reall dad.Clóda
4,An ancient treasure,"Others have summarized the plot of this book, but I have to add one thing. In 6th grade, while our class was studying the Incas, I found this book in the library. For some reason it absolutely captivated me. Perhaps it was just the evocative imagery and emotional tone of the writing. It made the tragic story of the Inca conquest come so alive to me. As a result I became obsessed with the Incas for 2 years as a young adolescent. I read everything about them that I could get my hands on, and wrote my own stories as well. Now that I'm an Old-olescent, I have had many other interests & obsessions in my life, but it doesn't take much to make this one come alive again. I just have a special place in my heart for the Incas, and I think it is time for me to order and re-read this ancient treasure."
1,Difficult to read,"This book which was written in 1952, has many difficult words and names from South America. It is also filled with poems which are difficult for someone my age to understand. The ""secret"" is told in one paragraph, so watch out and don't miss it. Look for something more modern. -- Zac L."
1,Really???,Most boring book i've read so far. Don't take my review away or else...¡¿('_')¡¿Don't report as inappropriate. Never buy this!!!
4,Excellent for Grade 5 and Higher,"This was an excellent book but certainly deep. The writing style was at times difficult for my daughter to grasp. She is in 4th grade (age 8 1/2) and I read this book out loud to her. What helped us a lot while reading this book was to also read from the encyclopedia about the Inca civilization. We also read more things about Incas which helped us to understand things like ""quipu"" which is a number of different colored and tied cords that Incans used to record events as they did not write. If you are already studying Incans I highly recommend this book. If you are not presently studying this culture this book just may lead you in that direction! 4 stars only because it is a difficult read for those under 10."
5,Best and cheapest Spanish-English grammar book,"I have bought over a 100 copies of this book for my ESL adult students so that they can understand English grammar. It especially useful in explaining the use of modal verbs, idiomatic verb-preposition combinations, and verb tenses -- like the present perfect. The verb chapters could be a little clearer but this is still the best out there. It is basically ""Master the Basics: English"" with a parallel Spanish text. Use it backwards or forwards. Just ordered 15 more."
5,Shockingly Enjoyable,"I typically lean towards much harder, darker, and more industrial music. However, this music has many layers, harmonizing like some of your more mainstream industrial metal, with a more up-beat, hookie element.The lead singers voice is beautiful, and the rythem gets everybody in the room nodding their heads and tapping their feet. Every time I'm listening to them and somebody hears it, I get an instant ""whoa, who is this?""They seem to trancend a large spectrum of musical tastes - from r&b; to rock to industrial to alternative-lovers everywhere I've played them. It's solid and just damned enjoyable to listen to."
1,Big let down,"I like Goldfrapp. I thought Black Cherry was a very enjoyable album, and then Felt Mountain came along and blew me away. Sadly, this rehashed Black Cherry makes a poor follow up to the smooth beauty and erie grace of FM. It probably deserves better than 1 star, but I feel obliged to bring the average rating down as 4 1/2 stars is WAY too much for what this album has to offer. It's okay, especially if you don't listen to it too closely, instead letting it serve as background music for... whatever part of your life you find most appropriate to do so with. Get the other two albums first."
3,Star (not quite) Struck,"A good movie, made that way by good performances, nonsentimentality, and dark comedy (the police raid on Eric Stoltz' house was especially funny). Good performance by Mark Rendall. The movie, overall, was uninvolving."
2,This Star Does Not Shine,"So-So story about a man's relationship with a less than pleasant child star and said child star's mother.Like that old Dickie Roberts movie, it tries to say something about the plight of former and soon to be former child stars, but does not do a good job of it.Mickey Rooney and Shirley Temple, where are you when we need you?"
2,Not what we remembered,"Much less zesty....may have lost its zip as it ages. Need to find new replacement, it's just not the same Viva."
5,Kraft (Seven Seas) Viva Italian Dressing,"I have used Viva Italian for years. It is hands-down the best ingrediant for creamy Italian dressing, spaghetti sauce, marinade, Bloody Marys and everything that you can think of that needs absolutely perfect seasoning. There's no need to keep adding salt, other spices, herbs, oils, sugar, vinegar - NOTHING! I was pretty devastated when I could no longer find Viva at any grocery store and equally delighted when I did find it on Amazon! I bought a case (6 bottles) which, if I'm feeling generous, I might give as individual Christmas gift! Thanks, Amazon."
1,Do Not Buy It.,"The book has too many problems. For example, the short descriptions of each scientist's life and accomplishments are not adequate - just a few short paragraphs. A person can get more details from an encyclopedia or an internet page. Second, the accompanying pictures are very low quality."
1,Cheap Stuff,"The picture shows something that looks good, but in real life the quality was poor and it looked cheap."
5,"If you are human and want to be more humane, read this book.","I last read this book a year ago, and it's teachings have stayed in my mind as have those in Alfred North Whitehead's Aims of Education. In my mind this is the value of a good book. In a review of this work Dr.LeeD. Carlson complains that Fromm offers too little scientific evidence for his findings. My intent is not to belittle science, but to elevate humanism, the philosophy of Fromm.If you like Erich Fromm you will enjoy this book; if you don't like him, don't waste your money or time; if you don't know Fromm, you owe it to yourself to try this book.I have given it 5 stars. You might too, but you must read it first."
5,Simply too good...,"The best from Fromm. I have had this book for the last ten years. Wanted a new one and was surprised to find it still in print. This speaks volumnes of the value of this book. From the first page to the last, vintage Fromm. We are also recommending this book as a text for our sophomore students at SUNY."
5,heavenly turquoise,Very quick and efficient transaction. Asked for the necklace to be longer and it was done (at a cost). Necklace was exactly as seen. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought these as an easy slip-on boot to take my puppy out (quite frequently). Perhaps it's the rubber or lining, but these are the foulest smelling boots I have ever owned. They smelled like musty mildew right out of the box. Leaving them on the screen porch and using odor neutralizer does no good. I attempted to wear them outside while shoveling snow - my feet were cold within an hour, and I had ski socks on. Perhaps the puppy can cut her teeth on them."
1,hideous,these were so hideous i returned them upon receiving them and they were not the ones in the picture. definitely do not buy these boots.
1,THIS GAME IS NOT MAC COMPATIBLE!!!!!,"This game is listed as being Mac compatible, but it only runs on mac OS 9!!!!! It is absurd to call it mac compatible when OS9 hasn't been sold in years. Only Myst III Exile can even run on OSX, and you have to install Rosetta Stone to do it. Extremely deceptive. I would be returning this product if my wife didn't happen to have an old PC to run it on.BOOO!!!!!"
1,riven,"myst 10th anniversary edition did work on my computer for the first game, but did not work on ""riven"" the 2nd game. I looked up various links to find out why and ended up erasing some stuff on my computer I didn't want to. I am not computer smart, but I guess that's what I get for purchasing a out of date game. So far #3, ""exile"" is working, but Iam really disappointed, so if you have and XP computer I would not recomend this edition,(dvd)."
5,Myst 10th Anniversary DVD Edition,"Excellent value, all on DVD so no CD swapping and the interface is enhanced from the earlier CD editions."
5,Bundle of gold.,"To me, this is probably the most important collection of a trilogy ever released. Each one of these games are breath taking, and tell a story that copy-cat producers cannot even begin to match. Having all three of the Myst games in one handy DVD collection is an honor. Every PC Game Enthuisist should own this box. We're all looking forward for Myst 4."
1,Another Colon Laparoscopy.,"Before purchasing the ""Myst 10th Anniversary DVD Edition"" I should have flushed my $[...] down the toilet. I would have had just as much fun.Myst was fun until I entered the clock tower. Then the game froze my PC and every other time I entered. When I tried to installed ""Exile and Riven"" my PC tells me uninstall the now and run a cleaning program ASAP.The plus in this adventure was the free shipping."
2,Does not work on Vista,I downloaded the Myst 10th Anniversary Edition only to find that it does not work on Vista - I wish that it would have said something on the ad for it.
4,been there - done that,"i played it once when it first came out about 10 yrs ago.....back then it was top of the line technology...if you never played the myst series , you should give it a whirl, just pay close attention to system compatibility , every computer is NOT the same. the myst series requires a moderate level of pataince and cleverness. it seems as the games evolved, so did the hint books....thats a shame. a game should stand alone WITHOUT the need for spoon fed directions."
3,Ubi Soft ruins Myst series once again,"Ubi Soft is slowly but surely destroying Cyan Worlds' reputation for the Myst series. The games included in this package are SPECTACULAR classics, but this DVD packaging is a disgrace. Supposedly redesigned for Windows XP, the originals work better than this DVD collection. Not only are the games hastily thrown together in an oversized and deceitful box, the three games include laughable snippets from the ""makings of"" the games. Ubi Soft is a lazy, worthless company undeserving of the Myst series to publish. It is almost if they tried to make this product rubbish.3 stars because MYST and Riven are classics alone by Cyan Worlds (Exile was not made by Cyan and it's very obvious). Cyan however should run screaming from Ubi Soft. I can't believe that this version in such a state was allowed to be released from Ubi Soft."
3,Not excatly what I was expecting in quality,"For one thing, I didn't even receive a box that looked like the one shown. The box i received it in is a lot smaller, incredibly beat up, and still with a price tag from Best Buy on it. Tacky. The CD's are in decent enough condition, but for a rating of ""like new"" i was kind of deceived. More or less it is what I was looking for at least."
2,disappointing,"I was unable to get Myst, the first game to run at all. It would go through the opening story, then lock up completely. Riven would begin to play, but after a few minutes, it too would lock up and no longer respond. After many disgusting attempts at these two, I uninstalled them from my computer. Myst lll Exile, would run, and play, but I was unable to get anywhere in the game, probably due to my own discouragement after the other two not so good times.I should tell you that I am running Vista, not the older versions, like XP or 98, so perhaps that would account for the first two versions not running. In any event, I can not recommend this game."
3,Myst on a Mac,"If you buy this for Myst only go for it.....the other 2 titles don't work well on a G5 Mac inspite of all the patches...fixes, etc."
3,Dust off the old computers,It might be great. It might not. I have not gotten it to work on Windows 7 or OS X10.6. I'm trying alternatives to make it work on Ubuntu but I'm not holding my breath.
2,Definitely not for Windows XP,"I was very disappointed with the fact that this was adverised as a Windows XP version. I already have Myst, which I played in Windows ME shortly before getting my new computer that runs Windows XP, and I have Myst Exile. I also have a copy of Riven at my parent's house and they aren't using it, so I could have retrieved that to play Riven. I bought this because I thought the idea was that it had been updated for newer platforms/machines, but I was wrong. I had to use Windows XP ""compatability mode"" at Windows 98 setting to get Riven to launch on this new computer. I could have done that with the old version of Riven. The movies played really choppy under compatibility mode. So what is the point of this 10th Anniversary DVD edition?"
1,yet another rip-off,"Advertising says compatible with MAC systemt X. NOT SO. You get the package and it says that only Myst III is compatible. Additionally, installation seems to be impossible for Myst III making it useless also."
1,Disappointed,"Before purchasing this product, do a quick web search on Riven to read about all the compatibility problems that people have had with this game. I followed the recommendations on the Ubisoft web page including: Changing the compatibility mode of the game; Uninstalling Quicktime 7 and installing an earlier version; and downloading the Riven patch (which was released before the game itself), and was never able to get this game to work at all. Very disappointing."
3,For those who can't get the game to work.,"You will need to use the Quick Time player that came with the game, version 6.3. Open Quick Time player, click the edit tab at the top, click preferences, select 'Quick Time preferences', choose 'sound out' from drop box, choose direct sound, and 48.000kHz. Now choose 'video settings' from the drop box, remove the check from the first box labeled []enable DCI, close quick time settings, leave quick time player open, run Myst or riven, game should work.If game doesn't work, go back to video settings and check the first box []enable DCI, and clear the last three boxes which have to do with []direct 3D, []direct draw acceleration, and []direct draw secondary monitor.If for some reason the game still doesn't work, go back in video settings of quick time settings, and choose the first option, []safe mode (GDI only)Game should run."
1,Doesn't Work On Vista,"Beware! Although Myst works on Vista (actually, it froze a couple of times,) Riven is a disaster. You cannot play Riven for more than 30 seconds without it freezing. So far, I have not been able to find a patch or other solution."
2,Too many technical problems running the game,"Played this game years ago and thought it was a lot of fun. I was really excited to see it at such a reasonable price on Amazon. I was disappointed as soon as I tried to play it however. It freezes up barely into the game. I just can't play it at all. Not worth the 15 dollars. If you have windows xp, I wouldn't bother with this game."
5,Myst,"It was about time to revisit the Myst series. What fantastic fun. I was not disappointed. Great mental challenge, although impossible without a few cheats."
3,Awesome to play but...,"first you have to configure your computer adequately. I ended up havingto re-install the OS (always a pleasure).Their help desk was on the ball.Once you start playing it you realize why the Myst series is a phenomenon.Hours of enjoyment and intuitive puzzles. A few times I had to go tothe Internet, but otherwise a joy."
1,Not XP Compatible,"I purchased this set today...because of the great reviews other had given all three games...and it would run on XP...but it doesn't! One won't run at all and another crashes every time I play. The third game did seem to be ok, but what wa the point after not being able to play the first two. Just be prepared to restart many times if you are playing with an XP system."
1,Do Not Buy!!,"I bought this set because I remembered how great the original Myst was...Big Mistake. Installation went fine, but the actual gameplay is horrendous. I am using a computer with resolution capabilities of up to 1600 X 1200, and at this setting, the game window is a box that can be covered up with my thumb. Ubi Soft made no effort to warn anyone of this, or provide a way of changing the resolution. Boo. Two Thumbs Down. This is a great game in theory, but in practicality, it is very poorly done. I consider this purchase a waste of twenty dollars. Consider these points, and research the game before you decide you truly want it."
2,This reveiw is about Myst and only Myst,"Well, since myst is only available in bundels with other games and with a whole lot of modifiactions, i want you to pretend that this the product I'm reveiwing is Myst. Well, now to talk about Myst. This game is hard, man! I've almost beatten Uru: Ages Beyond Myst which is the new one and I haven't accomplished a thing exept find some wierd thing that leads me nowhere and get the tower alighnment right. Thats after 10 hours of exploration. I don't know how you can beat the game without a hint guide."
2,not worth what i paid,i bought this under false pretenses. i thought it would come in better condition and i ended up not even being able to use it because of my system in my computer.
2,Only Exile works for me,"Myst seems to install okay, but then there is sound and no video. The screen is black. Wandering through the Ubi support pages did not yield a solution, although we tried many of their suggestions. We tried this game on two PCs (one desktop and one laptop) running XP and got the identical results. On a third PC we got error messages.Then we tried Riven and the game wouldn't even launch.Finally, we tried Exile, and my daughter is playing it right now. For the $30 we spend on the anniversary set, it's probably even cheaper than if we just bought Exile for the PC. Go figure."
3,"The games are great, but...",My rating of this product does not reflect the quality of the games as they are some of my favorite games of all time. The lower rating is due to the fact that Myst and Riven will not run on modern operating systems as they were never designed for such powerful computers and require a great deal of modification to run properly. Either that or a computer that runs Windows 95. Exile works great on XP though. You can't really beat the price though so I do recommend a purchase.
2,This version of Myst does not install for PC if you use Itunes,"I bought Myst Anniversary Edition for my son, who loves puzzles. Unfortunately, all I get is a black screen with a hand and no option but to kill the window. As it turns out, you have to downgrade Quicktime to an old version to make it work. If you do, you can't run Itunes.Don't buy the game. Sorry, there will be other games, this one's a ripoff."
3,Journeyman Project series is way better,I only played this because it was hyped when it came out and I played the Journeyman project series. Wouldn't pick up again and feel like I wasted my time playing this honestly.
3,compatible,"Misleading product information. This game doesn't play on my Mac Air XOS (version 10.6.8). I was very frustrated but didn't give up yet--I tried on my old toshiba. Although this operating system was compatible, the game freezes and closes with errors often."
3,Technical problems,"I love the idea, but I can't get Myst to run smoothly on my Windows XP machine. I am 2/3s through the puzzles, and the game freezes on a certain point every time. I had some other glitches too.Exile and Riven seem to run fine. Myst has problems though..."
2,Fooled me real good.,"Be warned if you think the games have actually been altered/rewritten to work with XP. Not at all -- they just rely on ""compatibility mode"" in XP. Also note that it says 98/XP. Not 2000. From the Ubisoft website:""Unfortunately, Windows NT and Windows 2000 are not supported Operating Systems for most Ubi Soft games.""And:""We are looking into supporting all newer versions of Windows as they become available. At this time we do not have plans to change our older titles to make them Windows 2000 compatible for the reasons above. We realize this may be a problem for some users. If you have Windows 2000 on your machine, your best course of action may be to return the game to the place of purchase.""To be honest, Myst and Myst III:Exile worked okay for me in Win2k, but it took some serious hoop-jumping to get Riven to run properly."
1,Wrecked my PC,"I had the PC reformatted, and the game still froze my machine. I had to reformay two times. Windows XP w SErvice Pack II"
4,MYST legend lives on,"I have only just started to play Myst , again. This compilation allows me to progress through the natural progression of the game itself and the changes in technology , both hardware and software.This will keep me enthralled and amused for weeks.I could not get this product in Australia. I knew I could get it through Amazon."
2,Not fully XP compatible,"The Myst series are such beautiful games and I was so excited that they were released on DVD specifically for XP. The excitement lasted about 15 minutes into my first playing. . .Despite the fact that it is supposed to be made for XP, I am still experiencing a LOT of trouble running it. In several different places in Myst, it crashes to desktop--bad thing when those places are pertinent to solving!As of this date, 16 May 2004, there is STILL no patch availble, or any signs that UbiSoft is working on the problem."
1,Compatibility Issues,"Like most of the other reviews, I also had issues with these games. I surprisingly ran Myst (the first game) totally fine with Vista Home Premium on my Dell Inspiron 1501, and Riven (the second game) kind of worked. It installed and played the game, but froze up constantly. I got to a point where it corrupted a save, and I gave up on it. Online forums contained many pages of issues with many different computer setups and troubleshooting, so clearly these games have issues. I should have read these reviews BEFORE I purchased this set, but oh well, maybe next time.The short and skinny: BUYER BEWARE, this product may not work."
2,Only for Mac OS 9 & OS 10 (you have to have both on your computer),"I purchased this product thinking that I could run the entire 3 CD set on my Mac OS 10 operating system. Unfortunately I had to buy it to find out that only Myst III (Exile) works w/OS 10. The other two CDs (Myst I - Masterpiece Edition & Myst II - Riven), will only work w/OS 9. I don't have OS 9 on my computer and it's no longer available.The description section for Myst 10th Anniversary DVD Edition is definitely lacking crucial information. It needs to say that it will work with Mac, but only if you have OS 9 AND OS 10 installed on your computer. This way no one else will waste their money."
3,HEY WHAT HAPPEND TO RIVEN THANX UBISOFT,"I purchased this with much antisapation, as i have a brand new computer with XP running. Surprise! Riven will not play:-( Myst and Exile work fine. I contacted Ubisoft tec support oh yeah we know about that problem alot of people have the same problem with just Riven thanx for writing us we are working on it.Wow this is suppposed to be reenginered for Win XP dvd big let down.So now i wait for a patch or a fix, Also i am glad i checked to see if URU would be compatiable with my video card nope big list of non-compatiable video cards. As you all know we can not return software if opened we just have to live with the programers mistakes :-("
1,May not run on XP systems !!,"The first two titles would install, but would NOT run on either of our current XPSP3 Pro systems. I'm an MCP, I know XP (and DX) backward and forward -- and I code mini-apps in my spare time ... so it's not like I don't understand compat mode, DX issues, or graphics issues.That said, from previous experience, the titles are great -- but this bundle disappoints in the extreme!"
2,Quicktime issues,"As much as I liked Myst from back in the day, this newer version has compatibility issues with Quicktime 7 and Win XP. In short, if you are running iTunes 8 and with QT 7+ (you must to have iTunes 8). It is unlikely that this DVD will work for you... Unless you downgrade QT 7 to QT 6. then the game works. BUT iTunes 8 will fail to open (errors on launch). So it boils down to what is more important iTunes or Myst. I could not any patches on the publisher's websites as of this writing, furthermore this is a known bug. :(FYI:dual core intel chip2 gigs of ramwin xp sp3iTunes 8 w/ QT 7off '03embedded video"
1,Gotcha,All I can say is if you don't have an older computer that will run graphics at 640x420 DON'T buy this set because you will NOT be able to play it at all.
4,"Great game, a few glitches!","The game play is the same as I remember. So far only played MYST I so I can't say much for the other two. There were a few places in the game where the game froze and just needed to be restarted to continue, or I would click on something that was to perform some action and the picture would not show the action being performed and the sound would lag behind. All in all I still enjoy the game."
3,Myst,I received the three dvd games and am unable to play the first two do to how hold of a system you must have.I am in the middle of the last dvd but was hoping to play from start to finish...maybe someday they will update it for us oldies who enjoy a good puzzle.
1,Switch to light for task,"I have a Homelite UT42002 string trimmer with a 5amp 125vac FA3-4 DPST on/off switch. I do not use the trimmer often but when I do, it gets a tough workout. The trimmer itself is great but the on/off switch is far too light for a tough job. I estimate I get about 20 hours on a switch before it burns out. After two burnouts, I plan to install a 15 amp 125VAC toggle switch which I will probably have to jury rig. I do not recommend this course of action unless you are familiar with the way switches work and are a pretty competient tinkerer."
1,too much handling,I wanted to order two of these switches but the cost for handling two is 150% of the cost of the switches. I mean really? does it take twice as much effort to pull two switches out of the box?
5,got trimmer working like new,"bought this to repair uncles ryobi line trimmer, it is only a few years old but he leaves it out in the weather, not a whole lot to say other than the old switch tested bad and amazon had a good deal on the replacement, it was shipped quickly, was as described and got us going again"
5,Repair it yourself,"The switch assembly was exactly as ordered by using the product code number. It arrived within 4 days and installation was quick and easy. Thanks to the prompt and reliable service and the reasonable shipping, I was back in business."
5,Ready Set Believe,"Wonderful book for teaching Bible passages.Would be nice to have cassette instructions, however, this may no longer be available. Without cassette use of this booklet may be a challenge."
5,Little Lame Prince,My Mother read me this book about 47 years ago and I just loved it. I felt so bad for this poor little boy who was held captive. Then the world opened up for him as he rode on his magic carpet. His adventures were so realistic I felt like I was with him. I reread this book recently because I had always remembered liking it as a child.
4,Little Lame Prince,This book is a must read for all preadolecent girls! It is a remarkably sweet and refreshing book that is perfect for bedtime reading!
5,The postcards are great.,I loved this postcard book. All the photos are great! I would NEVER actually send these postcards to anyone because the pictures are just too great!
4,Mata Ortiz is well represented by this book!,"This is a great book about the history of Mata Ortiz with many wonderful photos of the artists and their work. Not as complete as the 'many faces' book, but WELL worth the price. Some of the same pots from this book can be seen in 3D at www.ortizpots.com. Having lived in Mata Ortiz, i've seen many publications, few as well made as this one."
2,Portraits of Clay: Potters of Mata Ortíz,"This is a small little book, with a little bit of knowledge about the potters of Mata Ortiz, but hardly worth the freight to get it. Most of the other books available about Mata Ortiz are quite good.."
1,bad sizing,the hat is fine but size is not correct. the hat is too small and not the same size as advertised or labeled. will not buy from this supplier again and recommend against them
1,An adult woman wrote this book??????,"It's hard for me to believe anyone over the age of 15 wrote this book. And make that a 15 year old boy, at that. Too simplistic to be taken seriously .... when the two ""heros"" are not gorging themselves enough to make a sumo wrestler vomit, they are just acting stupid. This book is a waste of time. It is the first Evanovich book I've read...and it will be the last."
2,Did Evanovich write this???,"Janet Evanovich is my absolute all time favorite author, which is why I'm heartbroken over this book. I have never read an Evanovich book I didn't like until now. I literally finished the book only because Janet wrote it.The book pretty much goes like this: steal a hauler, Beans is kidnapped, follow people around, get Beans back, follow more people around, Gobbles is kidnapped, follow some more people around, Hooker is kidnapped(my favorite part, who likes a cheater!), follow even more people around, etc, etc... Wish I had a nickel for every car they tailed in this book. I also agree with the other reviewers, Beans the dog got on my nerves pretty quick.I'm still a huge fan of the Stephanie Plum series. I can't wait for the next Plum book in January. I just wish Janet would have spent her time working on the next Plum novel instead of wasting everyones time with Motor Mouth."
2,Very disappointing,"I like all the Stephanie Plum books (although the Stephanie, Joe Morelli, Ranger triangle is really getting old). But I found Motor Mouth to be just plain boring. I tried to stick with it but halfway through I just couldn't take it anymore. I figured why force myself to read it if it's just not enjoyable. Hopefully JE can still be creative and is not getting stagnant."
1,A real lemon,This clunker died about half way down the road. All readers should be warned that to read this book you are under the yellow caution flag. I actually threw it in the trash . Dreadful book.
4,Once Again,"Motor Mouth is funny, entertaining and still has a great story. Keeps the suspense needed for a great book."
3,Just One More Time,"""Motor Mouth"" begins with a great racing scene with Alex ""Barney"" Barnaby, serving as a spotter for Sam Hooker. The race doesn't go as planned and another wins. But did the winner have a little more help than usual from his sponsor?Sam has been a stinker as he drifted into other arms, but ""Barney"" still earns her pay when she discovers hidden computer signals on a rival car, takes off in a hauler with a shrink wrapped body, Sam and their dog, Beans.New characters enter the story to help may cling to your affection as Stephanie's grandmother.Moves fast, stays on track and delights fans while over indulging in the term ""Nascar Man."" After a while one gets the picture that Sam drives for Nascar.Nash Black, author of ""Qualifying Laps"" and ""Sins of the Fathers."""
2,Tried another,"Could wrap myself around this one either. I was hoping it would be a different great adventure. Someone else has to of loved it, but it wasn't my cup-of-coffee! (I don't drink tea)"
2,Not so plum...,"I was first introduced to janet evanovich in the book High Five, i loved it so much i went back and read the four books in the series and constantly looked forward to each release each proceeding year. When her rereleased novels started to appear, her romance and 'full' series with charlottle i basically came to the conclusion that for me her writing skills just improve every year and that is why i didn't like any of her pre-plum novels, and so when metro girl came out i ate it up like a good obedient fan and loved it.... Sad to say motor mouth, was just one dissapointment after another. And i actually recommend to everyone not to read it and be dissapointed. but then again, i am a die hard ranger fan and once evanovich finally chooses morelli, i will stop reading the plum novels. so it's everyone to themselves but i personally hated the book. an they're, how shall i say, not so good!!!"
3,I liked it but it was way over the top...,I really enjoyed the first book (Metro Girl) in this 2 book series & I enjoyed this one as well but not as much. Everybody in this book gave me so many laughs but I found much of the book to be way over the top. There were just too many killings & many of them strange. Barney & Hooker & everyone else involved were just way too calm & then the stuff they would do was just too much. Unrealistic.Overall I enjoyed this series & I'm glad that I read it. I would recommend this series.
4,"Fun to read, light-hearted romp or Life with Beans","If you enjoy reading the Plum series, you will find this book light and fun to read. The dialogue is not quite as snappy nor are the characters as colorful, but you can get carried away on the flow of the words and the changes of scenery. I could picture South Beach, the yacht, the luxury hotels and the concierge of ""The Pearl."" I loved Beans and Itzy-Poo. Actions involving the exploits of Beans are laugh-out-loud entertainment. Sure it isn't Stephanie Plum and LuLu and don't read it expecting it to be so. This is a diversion for Evanovich and I'm sure she enjoyed writing it as much as I enjoyed reading it. Spend a few quiet hours in your recliner with a Lite beer or iced tea and chill!"
1,Ho-Hum,"I'm a big Evanovich fan, or, I should say, a Stephanie Plum fan. However, the Barnaby/Hooker series is downright disappointing. After reading both books in the series, I still don't feel as if I know the main characters and at this point I'm not sure if I want to. I'm assuming Ms. Evanovich put Alex and Sam in the off-again"" part of their relationship at the beginning of the book in order to create sexual tension throughout the book. Unfortunately, it still wasn't enough to make me want to continue reading. I almost quit several times. However, NASCAR information was interesting even though I'm not a fan. I didn't care for the disrespectful manner in which dead bodies were treated. It was obviously supposed to be silly and slapstick, but I found it distasteful. Didn't have any LOL moments while reading this book, but I guess the really good jokes have to be set aside for Stephanie and the gang. Still a JE fan, but won't be reading any more of this series."
2,Forced my way through it,"I love many of Evanovich's books, but this one just wasn't very good. I love her dialogue, and the silly pranks throughout her stories, and this one had plenty of those. But the characters just aren't that interesting. And I agree that the NASCAR information was just over the top. A bit interesting if you're a fan, I'm sure, but I'm not. And, the characters are overly familiar as rewrites of characters from her other books. I'm sorry I bought this in hardcover -- I paid too much!"
2,It's a car wreck,"I love Janet Evanovich, so I was excited to read another of her books. But it was a disappointment. With the second book of the series I still have no sense of who Barney and Hooker are. Secondary characters ... Felicia and Rosa are more fleshed out. I simply didn't care if Barney and Hooker succeeded in their mission.Rather than NASCAR being a backdrop to the story, the book feels more like a NASCAR documentary with a fiction story behind it. Too much information about the inner workings of NASCAR racing felt forced and not really part of the story.I actually enjoyed Janet's released novels ""Back to the Bedroom"" and ""Man Hunt"" more.I agree with reviewer, Cherise, the first book in the series seemed rushed and this one does too. I'm not ready to give up on the series, but I hope book three focuses more on character than NASCAR fun facts."
2,"Oh, no!","Thank God I didn't actually buy this one. Characters were variations of the ""Plum"" series, and not as funny either. While Stephanie Plum's antics are hardly credible- ie, getting her cars blown up every other day- at least her characters are loveable and funny, and are enjoyable to read. This one didn't have much going for it, so I gave it back after a couple of chapters."
2,Yawn,"I'm getting tired of how formulaic Evanovich is getting. I really enjoy the Stephanie Plum series, but now in her Barney books we've got to have coy sex (seen it already), a big slobbery dog (yup, seen that too), and lots of come-here come-here, go-away go-away. It makes me sad because I really like Janet Evanovich's books and I'd hate to see them get to be all the same. There was a time when I liked Danielle Steele, but got so I couldn't stand the book after book cookie cutter heroine (5'1 or 5'2, blonde or red hair, blue or green eyes, beautiful with Daddy issues)."
2,Not Even in the Race,"As others have mentioned, this book pales in comparison to the more fleshed-out Plum series. I love the Plum series and I laugh out loud reading those novels. I didn't laugh once in this book, a couple of wry smiles was the best I could muster. Some of the reasons are: Barney is no Stephanie; and Hooker is no Morelli and definitely NO Ranger! He is portrayed as a real horn-dog with very little redeeming qualities other than being an animal lover, i.e. Beans the dog. Barney even beats up some guys for him, he's a loser. I would be happy if Janet continued to pour all her efforts into the Plum series and let this one dwindle off. I am not too much of a fan of the ""Tilt"" series either, boring!"
4,Another Evanovich Hit,"Although I am still not as ""into"" the Barnaby series as the Plum, I must admit, this one was pretty darn funny! Her books hold your interest, and they are really quick reads. I can't wait to read ""Plum Lovin""!"
5,Great Read!,"This book is really funny and a quick read. This would be a good book to take on vacation or lounge by the pool because it is light and funny. I like all of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books and also Metro Girl, so I felt this book was comparable to those. If you want a laugh, this book is for you!"
1,What!,"I ended up just skimming the rest of the book after getting half way through. I read Evanovich way back before Stephanie and have owned all of her books written solely by her. I suppose this book could be savored IF you are a NASCAR fan, which I am not. Most of the attention and detail went into that. I didn't laugh until after page 200 and I think it was a laugh of desperation. Much of the gags fell flat for me, they seemed too cartoonish. I like silly but too much was just dumb. Dog poop plays a major part in one. The violence in it bothered me too and it doesn't that much in the Plum books. I'm not sure why here, maybe because there's a reason in the Plum books - she's a bounty hunter. It just seemed to contain just a lot of surface writing with the two main charaters, and only got interesting when the minor characters showed up - the non grieving widow and the two friends from Florida. Finally some non-NASCAR color."
2,It crashes on lap 2,"I'm a fan of Janet Evanovich and her Stephanie Plum series, I think it's laugh out loud funny. I didn't care for this story at all, it seemed sloppily constructed and I agree with other reviewers, lacked a story line or believable characters. I left off a few chapters into it, there was no point in finishing."
2,disappointed,"after anticipating this book to be published. I rushed to the store as soon as it was out I bought it. It doesn't come near as interesting, funny, up to the usual standards of Janet's writing. It left me flat you ask yourself what happened to the interesting quick thinking brassy talking characters from metro girl? I would not reccomend this book. When I read Janet's books I usually laugh out loud. Nothing to laugh in this book all old dialogue."
1,Very poor narrator on the recorded book,"I liked the first book in this series but was unable to listen to more than a few minutes of the recorded version of Motor Mouth. The narrator was horrible, using a bizarre accent that would have been out of place in a cartoon for Hooker, and a bland cleaned-up standard accent for the New Jerseyite heroine."
2,How do you spell drivel?,"I am a diehard Stephanie Plum fan, and Janet Evanovich is a fantastic writer. Where, oh where do these airhead simplistic lightweight books come from and why? Such a waste of her talent! I don't know, maybe she is writing for a different audience, but I know there are Stephanie fans just like me, buying these other books of hers, just in case, like I do. My copy of this one is going on Ebay, where the last Barnaby dud went. I hope I get a buck for it."
2,Miami madness for the second time,"This is the second book in the Barnaby series. While I was greatly disappointed in the first book in the series, as I had been given the second book as well, I decided to go ahead and read it to see if the series improved. Taking place primarily in Miami, it involves a secret race car controller that can improve performance, a dead body wrapped in plastic, and a St. Bernard along with the main characters from the first book, Barnaby, an engineering graduate/gearhead who now works for NASCAR racer Hooker and is his on again/off again girlfriend, and Hooker himself. As in the first book, the plot and character actions not only strain, but completely burst any sense of credulity as the events cascade into kidnappings, hit men, and more murders. After this one, I will not go forward with this series."
3,almost satisfied my Evanovitch craving,"Cute story. Although there are many similarities with the Stephnie Plum series...this is definately inferior. It was a nice read between the Plum books and kept my Evanovitch craving somewhat satisfied, i would much rather see Evanovitch spend her time adding more numbers to Plum."
2,I would pass,I don't usually write a review on a book I didn't finish but something was missing in Janet's latest book. It went back to the Library today - thank goodness I didn't spend money on it...
2,Motor Mouth out of Gas,"I was so excited to get this book. Now let's face it these books arent The Kite Runner, but they are a fun fare for a plane or a beach--perfect for my recent trip to Hawaii. Halfway through the book I decided the easy Sudoku's were much more fun and amusing than this cast of characters. I rarely do not finish a book, especially an Evanovich--but when you could care less about the heroine, hero, dog, plot, story---well, time to motor into the sunset."
2,Once a cheater...,If you're like me and are completely repelled by men who cheat - pass this one by. In this book JE committed the ultimate taboo (in my romance reading opinion) and had Hooker cheat on Barney with another woman. Once I came to the first reference to his affair with someone else (in the first chapter) I could barely stand to finish the book (I skimmed). I liked Barney in the first book and tolerated Hooker but in this second book of the new series I couldn't get into it at all because I couldn't connect with Hooker's character at all. Buyer beware on this one - Evanovich missed the mark.
1,"Easy Reading, but not too good","I have never read this author before, and I don't think that I will read another, the story dragged, the characters are not smart, not at one time did I find it funny (although I had no idea what to expect). Someone lent me the book, and I read it and it kept me interested...sorta, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, go with Jayne Krentz or Nora Roberts, or even JR Ward....guess I don't like this genre?"
4,Interesting,"This was, I think, written in 1927 a year after Annie Oakley's death. It was released again a short time ago. I enjoyed the content and the writing style. The author was a friend and co-worker in show business. From all I have been able to find out Annie Oakley was a lady in the very best sense of the word...a capable woman worthy of your admiration. The book is worth a read."
2,Too many disappointments,"Others have written about this phone not holding the charge, and I agree! I can't tell you how many times a call has gone dead in the middle of a conversation, with no warning, no low battery message. I've only had the phone since November. There is not a quick, convenient way to redail numbers--you have to choose from a list of options, 1-plus number, or the area code without the 1, or no 1 and no area code. No easy way to speed dial. Range is disappointing. I'm looking for a new phone. Back to Uniden or Panasonic."
3,Not sure if this is charge problem.,"When I received the phone, I thought it was a great phone to use. The only problem is that the handset loses charge sometimes and I couldn't use the phone. I am not sure this is because I placed extra rechargeable batteries in the base so that the handset cannot be charged efficiently or not at all. It seems to work fine now after I removed the batteries from the base. But I am afraid it could happen again. Therefore, I am not sure if I should return the phone now. Any suggestions or similar problems?"
2,Run of the mill light suspense,"This is very very light reading. There isn't much but fluff here. The love angle was thankfully downplayed because it wasn't very believable anyway. There wasn't enough time for the characters to form any kind of relationship. In general, the story just seems dated (it is the early 70's I suppose)... I can hardly believe that some intrepid police inspector failed to notice key evidence that night putting the true murderess behind bars. Or surely forensic science would have solved the case preventing the mother from going to a mental institution.Readers would be better off reading something with a little more backbone... Agatha Christie or P.D. James."
4,good book for teens,His Greatest Challenge has an interesting plot. The story gets off to a quick start. It's blessed with good writing and realistic characters. It's a little to simple for adults and but most teens and older children will enjoy it.
1,Looks good Feels bad,"It is a great looking set. My grandson loves it, however, he slept over last night, first time since I bought it, and he would not sleep on the sheets. He said they were stiff and scratchy. He wasn't to happy with the feel of the comforter either. I had washed both and used Downey...and I will try again. If this does not help, then I am out $50+ because he cannot sleep on them. I will look for a new set, but this itme I will buy from a store...so I can feel the fabric. WHY would a company make such a nice product out of inferior material??Maybe you should consider not selling products from this maufacturer. Thank you."
1,Feels like burlap,"I wish I had paid more attention to other reviews. We won't even use the sheets on my son's bed because they are such poor quality. They are hard and scratchy. Had I not washed everything first, I would have returned it. Also, it looks as if the seams on the pillow case are pulling apart and to make it more obvious, they used white thread on black material."
2,Not Mature Yet,"After several attempts to really get into this progressive band, I have ultimately given up. Not a whole lot of melody in the songs, and the singer seems rather strained to make it all come together. If you're a fan of bands like Dream Theater or Kamelot, then look elsewhere. Thought Chamber and Atmosfear are more polished for newer bands, and I'd recommend them over this group. At the end of the day, I didn't encode a single track from the CD onto my computer. That's a first for me.On another note, the CD (when it arrived from Amazon) looked cheaply produced with poor printing quality on the label, and the whole feel of this album ultimately felt amateurish."
5,back to the good stuff,"If you are sick of all the boy band techno music out there these days, then this is the CD to have. Very talented group of musicians."
3,Grand Strand Beach Read,"Here it is Tracy. I am reviewing your book.Our book club said 50/50. Half loved have cute.It is a entertaining read if you like like lite reading.I personal like a little meat in the book. But I had to read it because the author was coming. But it wasn't bad for a a entertaining night. If you like lite reading you will like this especially if you are from the Grand Strand you will appreciate the local. Good Luck, with your next book."
1,Snooze...,"Snooze. One writer said this was fluff, but to say that would be unfair to the marshmallow cream Fluff that goes by that name. There are plenty of Southern writers out there who understand the terrain and can tell a good story. Um, she is not one of them. Not yet, anyway. Maybe if she sticks with it."
5,Perfect For Lead Singer in a Band,"I have been the lead singer in a band for about 6 years and I bought this wireless system about 5 years ago, it has yet to fail me. On stage it can become an annoyance to have mic cables all over the place, especially when you're a singer who likes to jump around or get the crowd into it. I have performed with the receiver about 50 yards away and didn't have any delay. For under $100 I would highly recommend this system. Although I go through great lengths to take care of my equipment, this mic has been dropped and beaten up yet performs like a pro. Also pretty good for recording too. No question, buy one."
2,There are issues...,My son got this for Christmas and hasn't been able to use it yet. The plywood with it isn't great...problems with screw holes and it doesn't sit level. We actually need to replace it! Box arrived severely trashed. There must be an easier way!
4,Hunan Harvest,This is a nice easy read that covers my Great Uncles time as a missionary in the Hunan Provence of China in the early 1900's please read and enjoy.
4,Great Book...,I loved this story from the beginning and found it hard to put down. It's an easy read and very satisfying!
2,Boooooooooring...,"The first 100 pages were ok, but then when they are in France, the book becomes so boring: ""...and then they drove through this town, and it was so beautiful, and then they stayed at this inn, and it was so beautiful, and then they drove through that town, and it was so beautiful, and then they ate here, and it was wonderful"" etc. etc. etc. Not worth wasting your time on. Also, too much was written in French, and it was very predictable."
2,When are we going to have strong women characters,"This was the same romantic dribble. Woman marries man when young, man cheats on woman when older, older woman finds solace in arms of younger man.Why do women need another man to get over the first man?Save your money and buy a tour guide book like Lonely Planet Paris if you want to read about Paris. And if you want romance where a great women meets a great man, read Jennifer Cruise"
1,Drivel,"This book was so cliche-ridden and trite that it isn't worth the paper it's printed on. The characters are predictable, the plot tedious, and the book entirely forgettable. Don't waste your time or your money."
2,My Review of The Last Time I saw Paris,I did not feel this book was up to her usually good standard. I am writing with regard to The Last Time I Saw Paris -- I was very disappointed.
4,My first Elizabeth Adler novel,I really enjoyed reading this book. The descriptions oftravel were my favorite part of the book.
1,"Read a travel guide or read a bodice-ripper, but not this!","While it was an easy read, as most romances are, I found the plot and the events happening therein extremely trite and redundant. A middle-aged woman escapes to Paris with a younger man after finding out her husband has been cheating on her (promising enough) but what ensues are repetitive descriptions of charming French inns, exotic food (if she mentions getting a ""grand crème"" one more time, I will scream!), and tepid, sentimental erotic encounters. Each chapter plays like the one before it: Lara loves the scenery, Lara loves Dan, Lara experiences self-doubt, Lara and Dan quibble, Lara goes shopping, Lara and Dan make love, Lara feels better. Ugh. Maybe a 7th grader would consider this marginally interesting, but I consider it something that would tire even the most bored, romantically-deprived reader. Check it out at your local library (at your own risk)."
5,Peace Makers Alert,"If peacemakers & activists are going to understand their history, then they would do well to read this book. It is an antidote to the miseducation which prevails."
5,A great new sound in jazz!,"Lindner, with a virtuosity that matches that of his elder brethren Corea and Jarrett, pushes improvisational piano-playing into a funkier, more laid-back direction. With the help of his like-minded small combo in a live setting - the drummer Marlon Browden is especially tasteful and unintrusive - they laid down some terrific tracks that tease the ear and the mind like expensive perfume. There are even echoes of modern composers like Philip Glass. (The only thing that takes away from the atmosphere is the faint applause in the middle of a couple of tunes). Plus the album flows beautifully from song to song. A winner!"
3,Blues theme,"Word!! This is very possibly what got me into surf music, when I heard ""blues theme"" in the background of a ny public access show called Magnanimous. Then I saw the movie, what a suprise. One of the most memorable opening scenes ever. I've been humming it for years when ever I ride my bike."
5,"Wow, this is great!","I have been searching for Davie Allan material for a long time. I'm glad I got to download some excerpts. It only makes me want to get the ""real thing."" The stuff sounds as good today as when I had it on a record (Remember those?) Can someone help me? Does Davie still perform with the Arrows? If so, I would really like to see him live. Is Davie in a chat room? What a ""trip"" it would be to talk to this legend in person!"
4,A good figure for Tink fans,I ordered this as a present for my Mom & she loves it.It's a well made figure & is a accurate representation of Tinkerbell.Any Tink fan should be happily satisfied with this figure.
1,BEWARE!! ____EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT,"I should have paid attention to the other comments regarding delivery of this item. I ordered this item on 12/6/07 as a gift for some very special out of area friends. I was just informed today 12/18/07 that this item will not be shipped until after 1/7/07!! What took them so long to figure this out I do not comprehend. Also, I paid for part of it with an Amazon 'earned coupon' which I disgarded after I used it so don't know how I would ever get that back. As a result I will just have to wait until the holidays are over for these folks to receive their gift. What a HUGE disappointment!!So --- can't even comment on the product or quality as I have no idea when it will finally arrive."
4,More than just a golf movie,An enjoyable documentary that shows the many challenges involved in chasing your dreams while also raising and supporting a family.
2,Where's Cinderella?,"Incredibly boring (the film too), Jon Fitzgerald fails to inspire. He generates little interest and, consequently, support in his quest to become a professional golfer. His is a story deliriously absent of adversity, intrigue and triumph. The film ends where it begins; a better than average golfer living a privileged but average life."
1,terrible movie,"This is the most boring, self-center, nonsense movie about a wimpy, self-absorbed, spoiled person.Where is the golf? Grow-up Fitzgerald!!!! This guy has major personal issues. All is does it talk about his personal problems. This is 100% self promotional. There is very little golf covered in the movie.DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY OR TIME WATCHING THIS MOVIE!!!!"
1,This guy should have quit after the first nine...,"Horrible waste of time. I absolutely loathed this guy by the end and so did everyone else I watched it with. Self-centered mooch spends a few years selfishly ""improving"" his game and enjoying coaches, trainers, experiences all paid for by anyone associated with the movie. He bemoans his relationships with his two dads but bolts to Scotland when his wife is due with their son to seek more enlightenment. Grow up dude. The preview was very misleading and this guy had no chance of ever making it on the tour. Wish I had that grueling hour and 45 minutes back. What a joke."
2,Oh the horror...,"This move is for YOU...If you love movies about 40 year old guys talking advantage of serious instructors i(im guessing in exchange for free pub) in a half assed attempt to make some amateur golf tour that nbody knows exists.In his first ever tourney the guy wins...shooting an 84? Iit goes downhill from thereProduction is pretty solid and earned that second star though.So, It seems the director has loaded the amazon reviews with shills. Anybody giving this sucker 5 stars is either a friend or stoned, very stoned."
5,Inspiring Adventure,"I really enjoyed this special documentary. I found it refreshing, inspiring and thankfully, real. Unlike many documentaries, the film is not preachy, or overwrought with politics. The story of Jon Fitzgerald's journey is so very relatable: Who hasn't considered mid 30's or 40's, what would happen if we allowed ourselves to set aside our ""real jobs"" and instead do what we really loved? It is a brave course, and I admire Jon for letting us in and sharing his experience. I think The Back Nine illustrates a common dilemma to modern man [and woman]; a quest for who we are, where we come from, and ultimately finding what makes us happy and whole. Weeks after seeing the movie I was still thinking about Jon and his journey, and of course, golf. Isn't the style in which we play the game an allegory for how we might like to move through life?"
1,Get Your Priorities Straight,Just horrendous. This guy does not have his priorities in line. It is certainly tough to sit through the whole documentary.
2,can't root for this guy,"Fitzgerald just seemed really selfish and deluded to me. I could not root for him. He talks about his childhood and his two fathers, etc., etc., yet he goes off to go on a golf tour in Europe leaving his pregnant wife and daughter at home. Robert Redford's comments about Fitzgerald starting his own film festival is very telling... the guy can't deal with rejection."
5,Inspirational,"The obvious storyline of going for it, whatever it is, is worthwhile by itself, and made this film great on its own. But what I really liked about it was the personal journey part where the main character reconnects with his dad and his childhood and family in general. I don't even play golf and I found it a rewarding watch. Anyone who plays golf will probably love it even more."
5,N~I~C~E~V~E~R~Y~N~I~C~E,"Although I have never heard of Larry McCray before, he and others on this CD are really something great.If you do not have this CD I would really advise you getting this one.It is a must have in your collection and believe me, you are not going to regret it,I promise you!"
2,A Mixture of History and Legend,"""When London Walked In Terror"" is very interesting and entertaining -- but it is much like a teledrama in its departure from history, and its presentation of some legends and rumors as fact. ""The Complete Jack The Ripper"" by Donald Rumbelow debunks several items reported by Cullen (even mentioning Cullen by name at one point, seemingly irked that Cullen bought some of the second-hand material ""When London Walked in Terror"" presented as fact).This book makes for a good story, but it's not a good history."
1,Bad quality,It says it can be used on thin sheet metal but it can't. I cut through very thin sheet and it destroyed the blade before it made it through one hole.
3,Old school game playing,"Plays on Win 7 : This a classic; some the newer Clancy games use DRM that seems to corrupt the Windows operating environment, but these older games don't use that type of DRM."
5,A fan of Goewin,"I have been an Elizabeth E. Wein fan since I discovered Winter Prince a few months ago, and I think this book is amazing. I really like the character of Goewin; she's tough and smart and she is not afraid to try things a woman in her time did not do. I admire that, and I also like her stubbornness. :) I enjoyed the plot, the dilemmas involved in the succession of kingship (especially for Goewin), though initially I had to keep looking up the Ethiopic terms in the back. But I found the whole book enjoyable, and I feel as if I know and care about all the characters at the end. I hope Ms. Wein continues this series for many more books, because I can assure you I will read them all!"
5,Fabulous!,"I just purchased this CD today, and song after song I just smile and think ""this is so beautiful"", and it's mostly original hard rock songs, it's like an oxymoron but it is wonderful. My 7 year old daughter doesn't know the songs originally, and she kept saying how the songs were bringing tears to her eyes. I got this CD after hearing him at the Galleria Mall in Roseville, Ca. because it was so awe inspiring as he played. I wanted to share it with my family, especially my 5 year old who can play music on the piano from ear, which aparently is how Scott started playing himself, and I wanted his music to be an influence to her. He is a true inspiration. Thank you, Scott, for sharing your talent with us."
5,"Great songs, love playing at work","Combines an impressive list of top rock songs with talented all-instrumental artists, which makes for a very enjoyable listen at work."
5,Good item,"Item is just as described. No issues. I had a problem with one of these blowing out fuses, but this one works great."
1,Old Version of Filter,"GE updated this filter at least three years ago so beware that this seller is shipping an old version of this filter. It would be helpful if the seller was up front with this information so the customer can decide if they are OK with an older model. The current version is FXULC (ver. 2). GE didn't help the situation by using the same part number -- with the ""ver. 2"" added afterwards. So if you want the latest version of this filter then purchase it elsewhere."
3,Drinking Water Filter,"Works as stated. I use it to filter my drinking and cooking water. Clears the ""off"" taste of my munincipal supply."
4,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"I thought that this book would be a bit more wordy. Knowing that some anthropology books tend to get very in depth. I was suprised to find that it related to the non practicing anthropologist in all of us. It was an easy read with very little technical terms, all of which were defined. I enjoyed the fact that Picchi began with a description of fieldwork, not just jumping into the book. I thought that chapter listings at the end of the book makes this book a tool in the classroom as well. Overall this book is a well documented account of a native american group few people know about"
2,Don't look for music videos here,"This is a few old Brits giving their views and versions of Frank's works. Mostly the Mother years. Ben Watson (the negative dialectics of poodle play) is among them.(that should give you some idea)This is about as exciting as a book on tape. Unless you are among the biggest of fans, you will be disapointed."
1,rip off,This is just some music writers talking about frank like they Knew him.I would not recomend buying this....
3,Bad day at the factory?,"It is what it is: a tube for mounting a PA speaker on a PA subwoofer. It's sturdy enough, fits, and does the job. However, it showed up covered in what looked like ""rust dust"" - very fine particles of dark brown metallic dirty stuff. Upon further investigation, the whole inside of the tube was full of this stuff, and it was leaking out all over the place - my hands, the carpet, etc. All is well now that I got it cleaned out and I didn't bother to try to figure out what this stuff was or how it got there."
3,icon of decorating,if you like Billy Baldwin you will like this book. He talks of his experience and the people of his day.
2,Terrible,PS2 USB Energy Metal Arcade 3 in 1 Dance Pad with Handle BarsThis pad is terrible. It has very low sensitivity and a lot of lag time when hooked up to a pc. If you want a decent pad go with a Cobalt Flux or a Blueshark if you can get one.
1,Phone clip,"Low quality product. Broke after one and a half month of using it. If you are looking for holster, I would recommend to try something else."
1,Loved the design - broke quickly!,"Loved the design of the product! It was better than the clip that came with the phone. The problem was that it broke almost exatly one week after I got it. WHile I was walking home, I hear a clunking sound behind me and I turned to find my phone on the ground. It broke just while I was walking! I wasn't putting any stress on it at all! I hope to find another one like it that lasts much longer!"
5,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,I Purchased this Holster for my son. He tells me that he likes it better than the original.
3,Large print or Small print ?,"To TYNDALESir,I bought a copy of New Living Translation Award Bible, International Edition from a shop in India. ( Ref: ISBN 0-8423-3649-4).The Bible has been wrapped in a transparent plastic cover' obviously packed from press. The buyer was not allowed to open the Bible to see the size of the script. Instead out side a "" Type Sample"" was displayed which was supposed to show a sample of the script's size and formatting. Seeing this adequate I bought it for my daughter. However after removing the wrapping and opening the Bible, to our surprise we found the script much smaller and formatted in narrower spaces. This is very unreadble; surely we would not have bought this if we had a chance to open the Bible before buying it.Kindly look in to this matter. Such overlooking should not happen to a Holy book like Bible.Thanks.Sincerely,George. ----------E-mail:tgpala@usa.net"
4,New Living Translation Bible,"The New Living Translation Bible is my choice for use when studying the Bible. It is much easier to understand. This particular Bible was an older version, but it was still helpful."
5,Awesome!,This is the first bible that I have found that I am able to apply to everday life. The index allows a quick reference for verses which offer guidance for life's situations.
3,I failed -- it didn't,"I bought this particular Bible, hoping that by reading and meditating on the wonderfully numerous calligraphic passages, I'd be inspired to read the surrounding passages ... until by the end, I would have covered much of the Bible. At least that was the plan. Well the calligraphy is beautiful, but the plan didn't work. It's hard for me to read a Bible that doesn't have references or a concordance. So this one gets 3 stars for looking pretty on the coffee table (if anyone has the needed room on his/her coffee table), but that's about it. Imagine the added beauty of a few well-selected references calligraphically done! Then it would have been 5 stars for sure. As it is, I think my copy will make a nice Christmas present for a friend."
4,"Shortcut to penetrate the phenomenon of ""Taiwan Miracle""","With the approaching of Taiwan presidential election which has been suffused with peculiarly the controversial issue of party assets ignited by KMT candidate, this book seemed to emerge at an interesting timing. Nevertheless, this piece of research presented by leading scolars in the field of IR renders an invaluable analysis of the intricate and complex political economy of my beloved country.It's an indispensable reading for those who have been aspired for the glory of the past to stare at some components of truth behind the mist of Taiwan history."
2,UGH!,"What happened to Tim Green? I use to love all of his book until the last one and, of course, this one.I agree with another reviewer who said that they could not like any of the lead characters in this story. I kept wanting to like the main lead, but he was written in such a nonchalant, I don't give a damn attitude, that I just could not get there. I actually did not care what happened to him and his precious wife.The story was boring and kept being entertwined between the past and the present in which our main character is talking to a shrink.Also, I realize this is a thriller, but the gruesome descriptions of killing of animals was not really necessary.Overall, this book was a little gross and a lot boring.On the positive side, I just took a look at the photo of the author and he is ""hot"". So, I should have just looked at the picture and insted of read the book."
2,I Can't Believe I Read the Whole Thing,"Normally, when I find a book to be as bad as this one was, I put it down. But somehow I kept holding onto the hope that there'd be a twist in the novel that would make my time worth spending. That twist never came. From the outset we know who the bad guy is and what he did. The rest of the novel is just him trying to explain why he perpetrated his misdeeds.Gluttony and greed.Save yourself the time and money, and go read something else."
1,Disappointed,I am a Tim Green avid reader...up to this point. I found Kingdom Come a total disappointment. From page one I disliked the book and could find not a single character likable. I found it hard to read and certainly not enjoyable. If I had read Kingdom Come as his first novel would not have read a second.
2,2 1/2 stars,"No I didn't care that much for this novel. Unlikable characters and a disturbing read. I usually expect more from Tim Green and I hope he makes up for it in his next novel.Pay heed to rave reviews. Because if this is the only book a reviewer has read, it generally means they know the author."
2,"No, No, No","I have to agree with the others who disliked this book, and disagree with those who liked it and called it the 'overused ""A Great Read.""I realize we all have different opinions, but mine was mostly disgust with this cast of characters. I also found it completely unreasonable that this man would turn on all his 'best friends' and SPOILER ALERT murder them. And why, for God's sake was he put in the Witness Protection program?The wife, well words fail me.If you really can't like any characters - except Ben and Bucky - why read about such people.Dumb plot, and not thrilling to me. I much prefer Green's later books on the law etc., but plan to avoid him the future."
5,Kingdom Come is Heaven,"Tim Green reaches a new level with this fast-paced, heart thumping, can't put it down novel that explores the dark side of seemingly good people. The main character, Thane Coder , will stay with you long after you've reached the last page. He's a character that you will love, hate, admire, and deplore....(think Tom Cruise in Collateral)......Kingdom Come grabs you from the first page and doesn't let go. By far this is the best of the best from Tim Green."
3,Silly fun.,"Definitely a movie that is cute and fluffy and fun, without much substance. To note is the cast full of rising stars, such as the two main characters. Koike Teppei has appeared in many dramas before, but it is Love Com that brings him to the big screen attention of international anime fans who don't watch Japanese dramas. Also in the film is Mizushima Hiro in one of his first roles in a film, and he's one to watch out for too, though neither boy gets anything particularly out of the formulaic character acting.This is not a hard movie to make, but somehow the director drags it out too long with too many subplots--I feel like the rival situation at the end was just unnecessary as we all know what will happen in the end anyway. Still though, the entire movie is pretty funny, and worth a couple of hours of your time for a few laughs."
3,"Not that great, but a nice bonus for fans of the manga","The manga series is one of my favorites, so I wanted to see what the movie was like. It was pretty much a disappointment. The acting was not very good (Risa in particular was painful to watch), a lot of things were changed (some for the better, some for the worse), and a lot of it was very silly.The film, however, did have its moments; the guy who plays Ohtani did a passable job, and when he kissed Risa at the end it was really cute, even though he didn't seem to be shy about it the way Ohtani in the manga would have been.My favorite thing about this movie was Maity-sensei. He was HILARIOUS, and they portrayed him perfectly with the sparkles and preening-but-kind perfection and all that. The final ""battle"" between him and Ohtani was over-the-top, but still funny.Overall, the movie wasn't great, but big fans of the manga or anime might want to see it anyway, and the movie's real saving grace was Maity-sensei."
2,Disappointing,Oh did we feel suckered. Out son loves Caillou so the game seemed like a natural. This game is really poorly done and clunky. It looks fine but it just doesn't work well and our son lost patience with how unclear things are. Bad directions. Poor execution. And more!
2,"Should have paid attention to the ""remastered"" descriptor","I've always loved ""Bette Davis Eyes,"" in spite of (or because of) the fact that it brings back memories both blissful and painful --from a transitional period in my life around 1980. I downloaded the mp3 of the ""remastered"" version a few minutes ago, and it is a wan, listless betrayal of a great song. The ragged edges on the voice are not there, the beat is too soft, and the urgency and energy of this interpretation are just ...blech. Based on this one cut, I'd stay FAR away from this entire re-recorded and re-mastered ""Best of"" collection."
1,"One star, One good song","One star for One good song, that's it folks. Betty Davis eyes is the first song,which is excellent. But from then on get out your pillow so you can fall asleep to the rest of the songs...hated it.ZZZzzzz"
2,"Better than J. Collins ""stoned-soul""","With all-Due-Respect to J. Collins ""stoned-soul"" I think that this person has it all wrong.Why does a performer have to have 20 years in to have, what they call, ""Greatest Hits"". How many performers have 20 years worth of hits ?Perry Como (30) ? Barry Manilow (20) ?The Beatles were'nt in for 20 years as a group but no-one will argue that they have ""Greatest Hits"".I think that the J. Collins review is wrong.A hit-is-a-hit-is-a-hit."
2,One hit wonder who is not Bonnie Tyler,"Not much to say about it: one good song, the rest is undifferentiated soup. One good song, but what a song.I bought this CD to prove a friend that ""Bette Davis' eyes"" was not from Bonnie Tyler, but, indeed, from Kim Carnes."
5,Great movie.,"I am not normally a fan of sci-fi but decided to give the indie filmGoliad Uprising a shot, well I wasn't disappointed. The plot is a verygood one, it is intriguing with a few twists which keeps you interested from start to finish.The acting of Aaron Weisinger and Shannon Lark was outstanding and they seemed to work well together. The entire cast was brilliant. Oustanding credit must go to Paul Bright for his acting/writing/production and directing of an outstanding film, one well worth watching.The behind the scenes section is definitely worth a watch too, a great insight into the film overall."
3,"Some good info, but wordy and self-serving","You have to keep in mind that this is written by a real estate agent, so he really has an agent's best interests in mind, not yours as a buyer or seller. That said, the book does contain a complete survey of buying/selling homes (mostly buying, actually), assisted by online websites. I found the text too verbose, and I wonder if the publisher or author gets paid for the sites they recommend, for a lot of other useful sites aren't mentioned at all."
3,Game is okay,"Game is okay, received it in a timely fashion. Got bored with it pretty quickly, though, not a lot of replay value."
1,A Bunch of Glitches....,"My husband gave me this game because I cater and thought I would find it fun. This game has a bunch of glitches. I've played many games in the past, Sims, etc., but this one loses saved games again and again. You can spend forty hours building your restaurant, save it, go back to it, save it again and the game acts as though it never existed. Then, the company's website is not yet up, so I can't even write them! This game is crap. Stay far, far, away!"
2,Don't waste your time or money,I bought this game from Iwin.com. The graphics were good. But it got really boring really fast plus it started freezing. If you have XP it won't work that good.
3,Restaurant Empire.... Play it now....Store it later....,"This game, Restaurant Empire is a really great game like most games when you purchase them for the first time. They are exciting and fun for the first few weeks, then end up on the shelf for future playability when you absolutely have nothing to do. If you like simulation games like ""The Sims"" for example, then you should buy this game. If you liked the Sims (past tense)when it first came out years ago but have now advanced beyond the continuous ""upgrades"" and expansion packs, then you better wait for Restaurant Empire 2."
3,"A good game, but....","I really did enjoy playing this game when I had it (my disk broke when *someone* stepped on it), and I definately want to buy it again, but...There are only two modes of play - a single scenario and sandbox mode. You can only compete in the cooking competitions (irritating mini-games, but still...) in the scenario. In sandbox, you have infinite money, can build restaurants in all 3 cities in the game, and all the recipes are unlocked. Now, I was enjoying the scenario very much, thank you, but occasionally I want to start up the game and actually have to build up a restaurant without being a multi-millionaire and without having to go through the tutorial part of the scenario. I think maybe I've been spoiled by games like Sim City and the like, where there are many scenarios, a separate tutorial, sandbox mode, and free play where you still have to unlock things. But, as I know of no better restaurant simulator, this is the game I will be buying again. Eventually."
1,Did not work on my PC,"I was so excited when i got this game b.c. i own every other tycoon game that exists. Although I have a pretty new computer with tons of space and great audio .. I did not have the required video card that is needed for this game to work :(I ended up installing this game in a neighbors house just to try it out. The gameplay was quick and all, but the game got quite old after a while. There are not a ton of furniture and menu choices. Also, you cannot customize your own entrees -- you have to pick from selected choices;rather than buying this game, I would recommend Fast Food Tycoon (the first version, not the second!)"
1,Great game but serious bugs,"I downloaded the demo for this game and was hooked! Some of the best graphics I've ever seen for a game. I couldn't wait to go out and buy it. I got the game home and could not install it. I checked all the system requirements. It took some time for Tech Support to call me. After about a week, I found out the copy protection program is not compatiable with my computer. Since that time, I've found that MANY other people are having the same problems and our only options are to mail the game to the company in HONG KONG to receive the disk that will work as the stores will not refund our money for an opened game. The game itself is GREAT and one of the best simulation games I've seen...however, it's got some serious bugs. It may or may not work on your computer. You'll just have to take a chance!"
1,A let down,"After playing Resturant Empire I found it to be confusing and a bit of a let down. Form the box itself it looks amazing. However, after playing it was anything but that. The graphics are ok but not spectacular, and i have to say the game is a little boring. after setting up your menu you just sit there and watch people eat. all and all i would not rank this game very highly."
2,restaurant empire computer game,"I got this game as I love the tycoon games like zoo tycoon, roller coaster tycoon, etc. also diner dash and that type. It loaded quickly but even after watching the tutorial I couldnt figure out how to play it.I got to the first place you added stuff to the restaurant wall, and was stuck. I seen no way to figure it out, so I ended up unloading it. The graphics were okay. They werent cartoonlike they were more realistic and you could watch the restaurant from different angles and inside and outside. Supposedly you can build other restaurants but since I couldnt get past the first one, I guess I never will. Definitely would not recommend it for kids."
3,"If your picky, don't but it-if not you could give it a shot","Restaurant Empire is a well developed game that has the potential if used correctly, which takes a lot of skill. I'm the type of player that doesn't like the tutorial, so this game wasn't one of my favorites. The graphics are bad, and for the most part the game is too. You just sit around waiting for customers to come to your restaurant. Once in a while you get a new recipe, but it isn't all that exciting. But for some reason it keeps you occupied. If you like trying new things and you arent a picky tycoon player you should buy this game. If you are a picky player, you'll find dozens of cons for this game."
3,This is an OK game.,"Don't get this game with 128 Ram. I did, and I have pretty slow gameplay, even after I changed the options. It is also tedious setting up menus, making money, and decorating your restaurant."
2,I've Played Better & I've Played Worse,"Being a huge fan of the tycoon game genre, I was thrilled when I saw a game that wasn't another theme park sim! The concept behind Restaurant Empire is somewhat original but I'm inclined to throw this one into the category of low-budget software titles just the same.The graphics aren't as sharp as Roller Coaster Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon, or The Sims but I can't say that I haven't seen worse. It was a facet of the game that I could overlook if only the rest of the game made up for it.When you get down to it, the game replay value just isn't there for me. While the first few scenarios were interesting, after a couple of hours, it just got pretty boring. Here I thought I would be in control of so much more than what I actually got from the game and whether or not you play with scenarios or in sandbox mode, it all looks the same after a while."
2,Bad,"It looks like it was made for an older people, however older people usualy don't play these kinds of games. I think it should be designed for teens or kids because those are the people who will buy this game."
5,Works Great!,My husband and I bought a trap thrower and we decided we wanted the wireless remote so that we could stand a good distance away from the thrower. The thrower works exactly as advertised. We purchased the foot pedal to go with it so this allows my husband and I both to shoot at the same Target verses one of us running the remote while the other one shoots.
4,"Like them, but they have fold marks",I wanted a cheap way to put 13x19 photos/posters up on the walls with some protection. The 13 x 9 picture frames add up quickly in cost. This is what I went with. So far I have order two packs (both from adorama)My only complaint is when the package is shipped the box size results in the item has to be folded in half. As a result there is a fold mark in the plastic. The only way around this is to ship in a larger but thinner box.
5,Amazing!!!!!!,"I am not gay but I was so in love with Rainbow Boys when I checked it out of the librarry 1 day that I read the book in a hour. Along with the first one, the second one is amazing, I have never read 2 such amazing books!"
2,No squeak!!,"The duck was great when it arrived. Then after 10 minutes the squeak has disappeared. My puppy was not interested at all, but before then the squeak had him jumping and barking and having a great time. Now I'm just really quite angry that I wasted my money. I would like to try another one, so I am hoping Amazon will refund the cost. But so far - not very impressed, and neither is the puppy!"
2,racoon,"Not as sturdy and duable at all. My puppy destroyed it, in a matter of 3 hours. was not happy at all with it."
5,Super Duck,"We've tried what feels like every squeaky toy, stuffed animal, etc. for your hard chewing Havanese. The only thing that survives more then a day or two is this duck. He's going on 3 months now with the last one and he's only managed to chew two toes off. We had the frog before and he chewed off the tongue in a week so I won't order that again. The duck is the one for us!"
1,Dangerous - should not be a dog toy,"My Newfoundland played with this toy. Unknown to me, the tail comes off easily (it might be glued on) and ended up lodged in her intestine. Surgery was required to remove the tail from her intestine and she is lucky to be alive. This duck should NOT be considered a safe toy for dogs, it is dangerous."
1,dangerous toy,The tail of this duck is detachable and can be swallowed whole by a large-ish dog. Friend's dog needed surgery to remove from his intestines. Don't buy this.
1,10 Minutes,"Bought this because of the reviews saying these toys were sooooo tough.Well,within 10 minutes my little dog had the tail and toes bitten off.Wasted my money."
2,Too Much Noise,"I have now listened to this disc on various players. Obviously the material and the pianist are great, but unfortunately there was a problem in the recording process and this was not cleaned up via a suppressor in the transfer process. As a result there is too much noise, primarily background air, On this disc."
5,"Awesome, awesome, awesome!!",This is an amazing book about the true life of Mary Magdalene. It starts with a contemporary story of Mary M. to help the reader understand what Mary M.'s life might have been like. The book identifies the mistakes that have been made over history to write an incorrect story about Mary M. It's a wonderful book to discover or re-discover Mary Magdalene. She's always been my favorite and now even more so. Great book!
3,"Not Bad, but Wise...","I found this book to be an interesting reflection on the most misaligned woman of the Bible. The author's assumption of Mary's age and class does not follow the typical party line of other books on Mary. The Sophia tradition of the Gnostic Church attests that since Mary Magdalen held a leadership position among the women of Yeshua's council that she must be of his mother's generation. I wonder why a woman must be at least middle aged to be wise, while a man in his prime can be endowed with the wisdom of the ages? Do we bleed out our wisdom during youth and only retain it after the menopause?LoveDance: Awakening the Divine Daughter"
2,Why so Many Typos?,"I have this book on Kindle and I am very curious to find out if there are different proofreaders/editors for print vs digital books. I am a new Kindle owner and for the most part I am loving it, but the Kindle version of this book is loaded with spelling and grammatical errors. Is this the case with the print version also? Mad Mary's last named is misspelled so many times one could wonder what her last name actually is. And some words are so jumbled that one has to guess what word the author intended to use. Also, the possesive apostrophe is omitted way too frequently.This is very off-putting to me and detracts from my enjoyment of the story, which is actually pretty good. This book deserves a better proofreader/editor. If the errors were corrected I would rate the book higher."
4,Very Funny Play with Brilliant Dialogue,I am currently doing a scene from this play at my school and think that it is just hilarious. I am sure that this play could easily be revitalized today and transfer to a hit on the stage or screen. Very funny tale about grad school.
1,Get R.E.A.L.,"I would spend your money more wisely. I suspect the ""truths"" that are outlined in this book and did not appreciate the crude language used by the authors."
4,Classy - perfect with the little black dress,I purchased this pair of shoes for my favorite little black dress and they are stunning. The only downside is that the straps on the back (at the heel) don't fit perfectly so there is a little gap.
4,Songs to remember!,"Not many people outside Brazil are familiar with Montenegro's music. In this cd he plays some of his best songs, filled with passion and and melody. His poem Metade is haunting and inspiring , and so are some songs like Leo e Bia and Condor. A must have for those who like good music, well-written lyrics,and the beauty of Portuguese."
4,Razor Eyes,"Imagine yourself in this memory: you are moving into a new house and you find some old letters from the war that you were in.I read the book Razor Eyes by: Richard Hough. This is a Historical Fiction book. I really like this book. It had alot of action in it. It also has some romace in it. The main characters name is Mike Boyde. This bok is about Mike who is a pilet that flys a plane over enemy territory and gets shot down. Because of this he was seperated from his wife.I think this book is for anyone who likes to read about World War II. ""We took off at dawn and before the spit fire."" I think predicted that he was going to get shot down and die."
4,"""Cute"" Concept but Worthwhile","Although the analogy used to organized the book was ""cute,"" it was useful in that the presentation was interesting, and at times, powerful and persuasive. The material was current and could be applied to events occurring today-foreign policy issues, the slow track for approval of judicial candidates, the continuing debate over the impact of majority minority districts, and the toll a negative media can take on an institution whose legitimacy depends upon the trust of the people."
5,The cutest vibrating watch - EVER!,"I have to take medication in the middle of the night and my alarm clock always woke up my husband, so I bought this watch. It works perfectly and it's so cute, I sometimes wear it all day too!"
3,A disappointment,"As a long time fan of Rosamund Pilcher, I eagerly awaited this new book by her son/heir apparent. Unfortunately An Ocean Apart is not up to snuff. The beginning starts out promising enough, but the story of David's recovery in America soon bogs down into a predictable mush -- trite characters such as the son ""Benji"" and the black housekeeper show David the way back to his heart. The unfulfilled mother with the erring husband completes the roster of American stereotypes. To say the ending is predictable is, ""erm"", an understatement."
3,An Ocean Apart,"I have read all of Rosamund Pilcher's book, so I quite frankly did buy the book because Robin is her son. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I had some problems with it. Sometimes the language was a bit self-conscious and stilted; for example, when the doctor's wife said something ""caringly,"" I winced. It sounded a bit syrupy. Also, I noticed the American characters often used words and phrasings that were much more British than American, which I think a good editor could have caught. The final problem I had was that the characters needed much more dimension. Rachel was an absolute saint and hard act to follow, and David was saved from sainthood because of his wallowing in self-pity and because he couldn't barbecue worth a darn! Having said all that, I will say that I read it from cover to cover, and once I was well into it, was interested enough in what happened that I was impatient to get back to it when called away. So he obviously has a gift; it just needs to be honed a bit."
2,Good story but a little unbelievable,"I just finished reading An Ocean Apart. Mr. Pilcher is a good story teller, but leans too much toward the unbelievable. Except for losing the love of his life, the main charachter, was touched with an incredibly charmed life. He was just too perfect to be true. In less than two weeks he manages to move to another country, find a job, a rent-free house in a very nice neighborhood, a (free) car, a dog, make several close friends, solve all the problems of a teenage boy, and find another love of his life. The biggest problem of the book was the offensive language. I doubt I will read another one of his books, for this reason alone."
5,An Ocean Apart,"The only disappointment at the end of An Ocean Apart by Robin Pilcher is that there is not yet a sequel! This reader yearns to hear what happened to David and Jennifer after the surprise at the House of Lords. The twist in the last hundred pages made me stop speaking to my family, give up food, and forget the laundry as I turned page after page. The tears fell, and I am now left with a sense of hope that there are more Davids in this world...men who are in touch with their sensitive sides while being able to command respect in the work place. The lovely sounds of the Scottish brogue written into this work supported and enhanced the text. THis is escape reading at its best."
1,Not what I expected,"I barely started this book. I was hoping for more of the style of writing of Robin's mom, Rosamunde. I was having a hard time staying with the book. He simply cannot write like she does and I was expecting too much. I was very turned off by the crudeness and swearing, which I have never encountered in her books. I should have expected that as a man, he would write differently, but I was still surprised. I am comparing this to his mom's writing, because that is why I bought the book. She makes every word count, but this was a blend that I just could not stay with."
1,Insulting,I have never read a book by the author's mother so this is a stand alone opinion based on the story itself. The premise of this novel is based on a man's wife dieing and him not being able to cope with this and withdrawing from his family and life. Luckily his family is rich enough that he does not need to go to work and can instead garden all day. I found this very insulting and demeaning to all the people who's spouse die and have to continue on after maybe a week of bereavement time from their jobs. My father passed away while my brother and I were in high school and my mother had no choice but to carry on. Does this mean her devastation was any less then the main characters? No. It is just that in real life people have to be stronger then the weak selfish main character presented here. If you can make it past this maybe you will find the novel entertaining.
2,How disappointing,"This is the third review I've written for this book. Although I have carefully followed all the rules, neither of my reviews have been printed. I suspect you only print favorable reviews because your job is to sell books, not serve the public. How disappointing. I will never read or write a review of a book again. My time is too valuable, and I have lost my respect for your review process."
1,What a waste of precious time and effort,This is one of the worst buys of my life. I thought I was purchasing a book of anecdotes and interesting short stories throughout history's greatest exits. This is a book that utilizes the same amount of space for Prince Humbert II as it does for great finales of General Custer or the Berlin Wall. Any person I can save from buying this book is all the better.
3,"fine journalism, unnecessarily wordy","Sabbag is an entertaining writer that takes the intricacies of the Marshal Service and makes them into a comprehensible and exciting read. To my eye, however, he seems to want very much for the reader to admire his command of language and to prove to the reader that he did, indeed, go to college. Here's one excerpt:""To suggest that such behavior, which was nothing short of routine, might give a moment of pause to those citizens looking for, say, the office of the Internal Revenue Service, is to indulge, one discovers, in the obvious.""There are others like it that require second reads and heavy sighs to get through. All in all, it's still a good read and the content is where it's really at, but Sabbag should pay more attention to the axiom, ""Don't use two words when one word will do""."
5,Great Book!,"What a great account of the nations oldest law enforcement agency. The book is full of information about the Marshals service, it's mission, and it's history. You'll also get to know some interesting personalities in the Marshals service along the way. I am a Deputy Sheriff myself, as well as a history buff. From that Perspective, I throughly enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down. Mr. Sabbag, thanks for a great look into the world of the U.S. Marshals. And as for Deputy U.S. Marshal Victor Oboyski - I'd be happy to ""do a door"" with you anytime."
3,Excellent Audio Production of a So-So Story!,"I really liked the audio version of this book. Different people voiced the characters, which made it seem more like an old time radio program than an audiobook. The story itself was so-so. There wasn't much of a backstory and I was sometimes confused as to which tribe was being referred to (there are two competing tribes). My favorite character was the lieutenant, probably because his character was the most highly developed. Overall, I'd give the audio version four stars and the story itself, two stars. Based on the story alone, I don't think I'd pick up another of Hubbard's books. However, the quality of the audio production would convince me to give him another try!"
1,What a tool,"I can't really add to the substantive critiques already made except of course to endorse them. It's just breathtaking how inane this pseudo-science nonsense is. Unfortunately, it serves its purpose to keep the faithful going in their anti-evolution delusions and mission to foist this garbage onto schoolchildren."
1,Waste of time,Are those questions prosed in the book really answered? NO! Save your time for something worthy.
1,"phlogiston theory, Flat Earth, Intelligent Design","A lot of very smart people have had some nutty ideas. (Newton was a devoted alchemist for instance) Intelligent Design is another example trying to make reality fit dogma.Perhaps there is/was a designer. BUT,Q: Who designed GOD? (and then, who designed that designer . . .ad infinitum.)"
4,Great Gift,This was purchased a s gift to help continue our ongoing discussions on this subject. Good book for ideas and conversation.
5,Another fine Dembski offering,"This book will be enjoyable and informative to anyone interested in the issue of intelligent design. Dembski covers a broad range of issues and objections related to his specialty in a question and answer format that makes it reasonably easy to follow, even for the lay reader.One reviewer below apparently felt that Dembski did not cover all the territory he needed to. Can it be that this individual does not understand the significance of the information question that is the focus of Dembski's work? Perhaps he expected a greater focus on nuts-and-bolts biology? At any rate, since the reviewer seemed to accuse the author of intellectual cowardice, he should have been more specific about Dembski's alleged problem areas at least. In my opinion, this book does a fine job of confronting the toughest objections to design head on. Buy and enjoy!"
5,Smooth and Chillin',I heard this album while in Australia as they play lots of Chill Down Under. I was luck enough to find a copy in a store there. I have been listening to it ever since. My two favorite tunes are: Walk on the Snow and Venice Beach...If you can buy it go for it as it is rare!
3,"OK for general reference, not adequate for CNE test","I bought this book in preparation for the CNE test, and found that it was not as useful as I had hoped. My main criticism of the book was the totally inadequate index. When studying for the CNE, one wants to be able to reference specific items such as acronyms quickly, and this is almost impossible with the index provided. The book claims to be geared toward studying for the CNE test, but many concepts covered in great detail in the book are not covered by the test. As a backup reference, the book is adequate, but not as a stand alone guide, in my humble opinion."
2,SALTY,"We actually ordered the Chile Limon Corn STICKS from another listing on Amazon and incorrectly received SIXTY single serving bags of these Chile Limon Corn CHIPS. The picture corresponding with the other item description was incorrect so that's how the mix-up occurred. Amazon did refund the full amount since it was their error.These chips are similar to Fritos but they are very, very salty with an overbearing lime flavor. I like salt and lime but these are way too powerful. None of my family or friends liked them either so we ended up giving them to our chickens who enjoyed them thoroughly. ;)"
4,Delicious and affordable,"This was a great deal and I'm glad I found it. I think Amazon charged me about $1.20 a bag. These are big bags, family size not lunchbox size. The flavor is best described as a barbecue/mesquite or slightly spicy hot corn chip with a splash of lime. They aren't too spicy (I'm not a big fan of spicy food), about the same heat of regular BBQ potato chips."
5,Olive wood crucifix,this item is so beautiful. I love the brilliant colors of the wood. It is just perfect for my sons room! I would recommend this to anyone.
5,Crucifix,This product was good quality and shipped promptly. I would recommend this vendor in the future. Would buy additional products
3,Karaoke Prep,"1992 collection of sheet music for Anne Murray's then greatest hits, plus some for the kids. Twenty-seven songs in all. Nice cover photo."
5,Exactly what I hoped for - just lovely,So lovely - bought for my 1 year old son and he adores them. Highly recommend you buy this now!
4,get one for everyone!,"We bought this for our 16 month old daughter after she fought with a friend over the cow. It is a really cute toy, and I want to to buy her some of the other sets.I am disappointed that the company decided to stop writing the name of the animal. It was one more way to reinforce what each one was called and what sounds go with which animals."
4,Cute for my farm theme nursery,"I don't know if my baby will like this or not, but it does look really cute in his farm themed nursery. Only thing, it is a little smaller than it looks like it will be when viewing it online, but it is still really really cute!"
5,Great toddler toy..........one year old's favorite,"My grandaughter received this toy at her first birthday party and it was an instant hit with her. It is very well made and durable. Her little hands can squeeze each animal to make the sounds, and she loves ducks, which this reenforced....""uck"", one of her first words. As a retired early childhood educator, I think this is an excellent value for a young toddler, rich in many language and cognitive development areas: teaching animal sounds, counting, colors, putting in and taking out, open and close, etc. I think it is something that would interest a young toddler for a long time. It's also very soft and would be a nice safe toy for car rides. I was happy to find this on Amazon, after seeing hers so I could purchase one as a gift."
5,Oil Cap,Exactly what was described in the description fits perfectly on my 1990 Nissan D21(Hardbody). Only thing negative thing which isn't a big deal is that it does have that little chrome or different color oil icon but as said not a big deal
5,Wow it's ugly,"I really love Puss in Boots and I can understand if it were just a demented version of him--but it looks nothing like him. I got him for my birthday--which is today actually! Anyway, he doesn't look anything like Puss, but the worst part is the voice--NOT EVEN kinda close to Antonio Banderas--I mean would it have been that hard to get someone to sound like him??? It sounds so awful. I gave it 5 stars for fun, because it's fun to laugh at. How can you make it not look like him? That has to be difficult.good lord these people, who hires them to design kids' toys? crying shame"
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed. It is very small, the quality of the fabric is very low. It wasn't even good for display, as a toy is; don't even think about it"
4,Nice!,This costume is well made for what I paid for it. Thank goodness my mom was able to adjust the jacket. This costume in a large was too tight for me and the plus size was to big. I was able to alter it and this costume looks amazing!
3,Nice school girl,"The costume is nice and it had a great price. I didnt like that the sizes runs very small, it is more like a XLarge."
3,costume,its ok looks good and served the purpose for the party... would order it again.. liked the colors.. and others liked it as well..
5,Super cute and great service!,Super cute and great service! I even had to return one because I bought the wrong size and they exchanged it promptly and with no hassle.
2,Bring This in For a Landing,"Okay, folks, here is the story. Suburban mom Jenny Meade spends a lot of time carpooling her 4-year-old Linnea and her Matthew, 10-year-old Patsy and her big mouthed friend Crista and 14-year-old Philip from school to swim meets to home. Jenny is a semi-retired pilot anxious to get back into the wild blue yonder. Berlie, Jenny's husband has some neo-Neanderthal ideas of what he expects of his wife -- he wants her to get a ghastly station wagon instead of keeping the spiffy 1979 Honda Accord (to her credit, Jenny keeps the Honda) and tries to ground her airplane aspirations. To her credit, Jenny gets back into the cockpit at the end of the story.To throw some adult themes into the mix, we have a suicide (actually it is a murder, but Jenny won't rest until she finds the killer), and her kids' doctor is an adulterer about town. It ain't great folks, but it'll entertain you when the computer is down and you finished all your other pleasure reading."
4,I must agree with the other reviewers.....,"I'm not much of an EP guy, but based off the full lenth LP this band did, i wanted/needed to give this a shot. I'm glad i did as the EP is a strong and solid album with different sorts of sounds which ended up being involved on the LP.The EP at times is a bit more rock than the LP and it serves it well. In addition, it's got some slower songs which melt your ears while listening via headphones. It's a wonderful companion piece to the LP and if you love the band, you should 100% grab this Ep."
2,A Lukewarm Magic novel at best,"Moons of Mirrodin falls drastically short of McDermotts previous work in Judgement, and even more drastically short of the preceding Onslaught cycle. While it deals with an interesting world it just doesn't ""feel"" like fantasy. For a long time Magic novels have proudly combined fantasy with scifi, but this clearly felt to much like scifi. In addition he got characteristics of the colors wrong, lacked much character development, and refused to give any sense of politics to it forgetting a long tradition of MTG politics involving many points of view that in this novel have been traded in for just Glissa's."
1,"beautiful prose, fascinating characters.","Too bad the author forgot to write a story. :(It's really too bad. The premise is wonderful and the writing is great. However the characters are so sterile that I simply don't care about them in the least. This book reminds me of fine crystal. Sharp, beautiful but cold and, in the end without meaning."
2,broke,This band broke after about 2 years of not very intense use. It always felt somewhat flimsy without good resistance.
3,Nice but a too flexible,"it is a good band but it is too flexible, i should have bought the strong (heavy) instead..."
3,Serves the purpose - but its too skinny,"For a cheap band, it was alright. It was really too skinny so when I looped it around my foot, it didn't stay flat, but more rolled up. It was an ok band, but I find that I don't use it anymore since I got annoyed with it."
2,well...,"Well seeing as I do like Destiny's child (Original first).. But this dvd/video was a waste of time and energy. Not to mention money. Everything that you see on it DVD/VHS.. if things you can record off the TV your darn self. lol. But if you like to see video from beginning to end maybe you'll like this... Oh yeah.. Ever notice that the ""platinums"" on the wall, on the video/dvd are all with the original members....I thought it was just me."
2,Even if you're a Destiny's child fan BEWARE of this DVD,"I'm a big Destiny's Child fan but in all honesty i am dissapointed with this DVD.For a start there seem to be some of the best videos missing,it's great to have the classic hits,but where is their second hit 'With Me' or the video to the duet they released in the UK with 'Mathew Marsden'.Also missing is the video to one of their best songs 'get on the Bus'(which is a bonus track on the UK edition of 'The writings on the wall' and as the DVD's called 'The Platinums on the wall' they could have included that at least.Also missing are the videos to 'Independant Women' and 'Survivor' no doubt on the NEXT DVD they try to rip us off with.there are no behind the scenes or interviews and Michelle is on the front when she doesn't even SING in any of the featured videos.What about LaTavia and LaToya(The original sassy members)A BIG let down."
4,Destiny's Child's brilliant sophomore album,"Destiny's Child's brilliant sophomore album, ""The Writing's On The Wall"" has sold over six million copies in the U.S. alone and yielded four Number One singles.Destiny's Child were introduced to the world with their debut single ""No, No, No"" and soon after it's release, the single jumped to the top of the charts worldwide and went Plantinum making way for the group that would soon be crowned the Top Selling Female Group. Hit by hit, ""Bills, Bills, Bills"", ""Bug A Boo"", ""Say My Name"" and ""Jumpin' Jumpin'"" all topped the singles charts and became the hottest jams in the clubs and the streets.If you love your R&B music then you're going to love ""Destiny's Child's - The Platinum's On The Wall"""
2,"Cute, But Not Worth The Price","I was disappointed to find out that thisdoesn't really ""clip"" to the bowl edge.It has a notch/groove that is supposedto snap over the edge. All my bowlshave lips on them, so when I try toput 'Yolky' on the bowl it sits at amajor slant (making it useless).With shipping costs the price was overseven dollars. Unless your really intocute, I'd pass on this item."
3,Innovative but not yet perfect,"I love the cool fun look of it. When a new girl stays over and I cook her breakfast the next morning for her services they always say how ""cute"" it is.But as a man I don't look for things that are cute I look for things that work. I wish this would hook on to cups so I don't have to break an egg with one hand and hold this thing over the cup on the other."
1,Technical view,In all my years of research I have never come across a more impractical book This book clearly states the person who wrote it has no real knowledge of digital or analogue encryption systems Most of the contents can be found in other books from the original authors This book is the greatest form of plagiarism I have ever come across It is eyewash to the technically skilled The only useful material in this book would be for enthusiastic World War 2 veterans who would be interested in ancient technology I have no doubt that mr mc cormac was a good TV technician or ham radio user but hacker?Professor Leo M Walsh
5,Glad to have this!!,"I just recently replaced this in my Library, I had both VHS and DVD, but they ended up getting lost in a move, so I had to buy again. This time it was better because I got through Amazon vers EBay and the quality is better. I grew up with this series and it has a special place in my life growing up."
4,Isis Video,"I remember this series when I was young. Joanna Cameron was a cool super hero! There was Isis and Shazzam, both were good shows to see on Saturday mornings. I liked them more than the cartoons because there were too many of them."
4,"ISIS Joanna, i love you","such a fun series. the 1970's, how fast it went & how i miss it ! j. cameron was very pretty. ****"
5,Blast from the Past!,"ISIS, along with her Filmation friends over on such series as SHAZAM!, ARK II, Space Academy and Jason of Star Command, were a staple of many kids of the 70s, including me. With the exception of SHAZAM! they have all been released to DVD, which enables us all to go back to a simpler time, and a much more innocent time.ISIS is a great series when you have the nostalgia to appreciate it. It is absolutely cheesy, and cheaply produced, but star Joanna Cameron always played her part with pride and nobility, and the stories contained morals and guidance for the young audience they were produced for.Superhero Captain Marvel also makes a few appearances.Recommended to fans of the 70s, and of superheroes!"
5,Brings back memories...,"...of Saturday mornings when Isis and Shazam were the best shows for young people to watch (and maybe a few adults just for Joanna Cameron in her Isis outfit). While made on a very low budget the shows were always entertaining and had a message for youngsters too. Sure beats watching what passes for entertainment for children these days. While it would have been nice to have had Joanna Cameron participate in the extras, there is an interview with her on the unofficial ISIS website that does the trick."
5,Excellent,I loved this series as little girl - so it was fabulous that I have been able to buy the series and relive my childhood! Very satisfied with quality of product and delivery. (be aware that you might have to unlock region codes on dvd player to enable it to read dvd - found these instructions on the Internet). RECOMMENDED PURCHASE.
5,Isis,"Absolutely fantastic!!!!!One of the best saturday morning super hero shows made.The music is great.The casting is great.Isis was created as a companion show to Filmation's Shazam! (which featured DC character Captain Marvel).The episodes were soon shown back to back as ""The Shazam/Isis Hour"".Now BCI owns the Isis series, and Warner Bros owns the Shazam! series.In 3 episodes, Isis calls on the help of Captain Marvel, creating a crossover. Subsequently, in episodes of Shazam, Isis guest stars occasionally. In the first of these Shazam! episodes, Billy Batson says (in reference to Isis's bird Tut), ""That's the bird that contacted Captain Marvel, when Isis needed help (a pretextual reference to a scene from the Isis series). So the continuity between both shows was well written in 1975.DOESN'T THIS MAKE YOU HOPE WARNER BROS WILL GET SHAZAM OUT OF THEIR VAULTS AND ONTO DVD?The Isis DVDs also have isolated music scores for some episodes, and other extras."
4,"Zephir winds that blow on high, left me up so I may fly!","Nothing beats the 70's first TV heroine like Isis. Before Wonder Woman this Saturday morning superhero was the first of it's kind. Teamed up with the live-action show Shazam!, Isis won in the ratings for Saturday mornings. With great morals and some of the first issues brought up on children's tv such as a death of a pet, this groundbreaking series is a must. Great for all ages."
2,"a great show, for its time.","this show was a great show for its time. the 1970's, plus it did not have a big budget so dont expect much in the way of special effects. but this show and shazam both teaches a lesson in each episode."
5,A pleasure to watch shows from the past...,"Although the shows had no violence but, they did show sexism and the battle of the sexes that exist today. Some guests on the series got their start on this show and starred on their own shows later on. This DVD was a pleasure to watch and I recommend it to all who grew up during the 1970's because ISIS will fly back into your heart's once again! Also, back then people didn't have to buckle up their seat belts or lock their vehicles. The states didn't force citizens back then to buckle up or be fined heavily for what is considered breaking the law today. Is that progress? Or socialism?"
3,Isis of today?,Fast delivery. This is a fun trip down memory lane. Wonder what the Isis of today would be like?
2,CLICHE is the word,"Isis originates way before the Arabian invasion of Egypt. I'm European and even I wouldn't mind seeing an African, or Arabian and African mixed adaption of this story. It's disrespectful if you think about it. An alright tale without an authentic cast. Imagin a latin Julius Ceaser story and you get where i'm coming from. Alright story though."
1,Oh was this garbage......,"This Saturday mourning series ran two seasons on CBS, I belive it was 1976 or early 1977. It has not been seen inalmost thirty years. Boy I wish it had stayed locked away somewhere because it's awful. Full of people who never worked again."
5,An excellent resource for experienced DBAs,"An excellent, must-read book on internal waits for experienced DBAs and performance engineers. Some reviewers gripe that a lot of the information can be found in MetaLink - that is true, but you have to weed through a lot of disconnected discussions. I found this book very useful because it has great depth, is well organized and is a great springing board to further research into other sources - including MetaLink. Excellent work Steve. I can't wait for any follow-on books."
4,An excellent base for advance tuning,"The first book i have read which explains the ""why"" part of the tuning, not just the ""do this to achieve that"" thing. This book makes you ready for the tuning adventure, cant wait for the next book by steve. One minus point is the lack of diagrams to help understand the memory structures better."
2,Superficial,"This book does not really go too deep into Oracle internals. More information on the subject is available anyway from metalink or white papers. Without access to Oracle's source code it is impossible to write a real book on Oracle internals and reading this book, it didn't seem likely that the author had access to such information."
2,A book on internals without access to internals,"This book misses the point on quite a lot of the Oracle internal structures. Obviously the author had little access to Oracle development and it is difficult to write a book on Oracle ""internals"" without access to Oracle ""inside"" information."
5,Great fun and lots of skill building,"My three year old really enjoyed this video. The video has fun music, and depicts preschool age children doing various tasks, including sweeping, cleaning up, learning to put on gloves, shucking corn, playing outdoor games and making french bread. The music has singable lyrics that follow each of the activities depicted. This was all my child wanted to watch for two solid weeks! I would definately recommend this to other parents of two to early four year olds."
3,When Jesus Returns he Will say the same thing I would say to,"you......"" I dont know you be gone from me you worker of iniquity"" You will say lord lord we did this and that for you ...and in your name..."
2,"It's Free, But Full of Holes","Written in 2004, and reads as such. Treats a holy subject subjectively. and often washes dogma and tradition under a bridge. Conjecture without scriptural or scientific reasoning. It is free, and worth every penny."
3,It was for my kid,My daughter had a copy she broke. This was the replacement for the broken C.D. I don't know why I have to write five more words.
5,Safety for little ones,My grandkids love it. The little ones dance to the music and my 4 yr old loves to learn. I am looking for more videos to purchase.
3,almost what I wanted,bought on the recommendation of a tweet from an experimenter to use as an off camera flash with my iPhone 4. Not getting consistant indoor firing. still putzing with it.
1,Follow Advice -- go to Jail,"Schiff himself spent time in jail after following his own advice and was forced to pay up his back taxes using money from his book sales. Follow his advice, and the same could happen to you.There are plenty of legitimate grievances against the tax system -- its too intrusive, too big etc. The best way to resolve them is to urge tax reform through your Congressman."
1,Have you succeeded?,"I have a friend who is in the early stages of disputing the IRS-Seems Scary. I believe that everything Mr. Schiff writes about is 100% true, but has anyone out there done this and succeeded? If so, how many years? We need to hear more success stories on these review forums. If people who succeed at this would get the word out, maybe a greater population would do it."
3,It worked for me!,"I met Mr. Schiff in 1996, purchased this book, and have practiced many of the researches he provided. I rank it a 3 star only because his new book the Federal Mafia would be a 10 star book in further research. The review by trader100 should rightfully be called TRAITOR100... because he is one of the sheeple thinking the government that has screwed all Americans since the illegal imposition of a constitutional amendment that was NEVER passed is going to FIX? a system they benefit and profit from! Big Brother will take care of him... hahahaha.. Mr. Schiff's time in jail was NOTHING more than being a political prisoner to shut him up...same as LaRouche...I highly recommend this book and Mr. Schiff's research to any true researcher of truth and facts. If we all continue to think as sheeple, like trader100, then we deserve being LIED to and SCREWED at every whim of our Big Brother Masters."
2,Disappointing,"If you yearn to discover more gorgeous single track in the Ozarks, you'll find this book falls a bit short. Riding on fire roads, to me, just isn't mountain biking.As much as I love Mr. Henry's book, ""The Best of Tent Camping, The Ozarks,"" I was very disappointed in this book on mountain biking. Many of the trails that are recommended here are merely gravel roads that a lover of single track won't enjoy. Mr. Henry is great at directing a lover of the outdoors to great camping and hiking, but, unfortunately, when it comes to why most of us ride, he just doesn't get it."
3,credit for guts,"You've to give this film some credit for guts. No style, no substance and zero star -power...And yet it carries a flamboyant flag for that frisky female fantasia known as The Wanton Woman."
3,Great for Kids,"These are funny little cups and my kids love them. They are a little large for normal US Large eggs as some of the eggs will settle down fully into the cup and depending on the fit may move around and make it difficult to spoon out the eggs. I will likely stick with more conventional (read ""grown up"") style cups.The spoons on the other hand are not very useful. The would be great for very small children and in fact they remind me of baby spoons. However the edges are just too rounded and do not dig into the flesh of the egg well. If you like your eggs anywhere close to medium or above you will not be able to use these spoons effectively."
1,Almost......,"These are darling!.....BUT none of my eggs ""fit"" into three of the cups....have tried Large, EXTRA Large, and Jumbo....all sink down into cup holder....so have to put scrunched up napkin in bottom to hold egg up. Strangest thing is one of the cup holders is OK....but other three are HUGE. Guess they need to work on their quality control!"
3,Cute but too small spoons to small even for school age child,"This is an adorable set - too cute! The egg cups are good size, however the spoons are soo small they are realy only suitable for very small child just learning to eat with a spoon through young todler. These would proprably be great snack cup set for very young children for custard, pudding, yogurt, etc. However due to the shape and size of the spoons, practicle for anyone much older than a pre-schooler."
5,Super cute and other uses too.,"These are adorable and my kids, who are getting a little older now (one in high school) still love them. FYI I use them even more often for a half of a kiwi."
2,Cute but not so useful.,"The cups hold the egg securely, it's not likely to fall out even with a child handling it. They hold the egg so well infact, getting the shells out of the holder is a pain. The spoons are too blunt to really pierce the egg with. They just make a big mess. I threw the spoons out."
3,Cute but not best material,"I like the design. But the material feels like cheap plastic, so not that really great. Also, the US large sized eggs fit almost completly inside the cups. I suppose it is designed for the european market, where the regular eggs are larger than in the US.But I guess for the price one shouldn't expect much better quality."
4,A replacement,This cd contained many if not all of the songs I owned on an lp that was out of print and could not purchase the same cd. The Animals were my group of choice during the English invasion. Must have if an Animals fan.
4,A good introduction to other Traditions and their Founders,"I am the HPS of a Coven. This is required reading for one of our Degrees. I feel that it is an invaluable resource to become familiar with the Founders of other Traditions. With that being said, some of the interviews are boring. Some of the interviews are down right freaky. I am a glad people are willing to talk openly about what it is they believe, and I feel this book got to the core of that in most of the interviews, however...there were a few that just made me go Whoa! No wonder people thing Pagans are nuts!I would recommend this book and not the new editionBeing a Pagan: Druids, Wiccans, and Witches Todaysimply because the new addition doesn't update any of the information and there are less interviews. If the new edition had updated interviews, then it would be my pick.The good: An EXCELLENT reference on the founders of some of the major Trads in Paganism.The bad: A bit dry and sometimes sounds a bit...nuts."
4,Amazing product for those with sun-sensitivity!,"I have spent years trying to find a sunscreen product that would allow me to spend time in the sun without burning or breaking out in a sun-related rash. I bought this product before going on a week-long vacation in Florida and I had more fun than ever on the beach without worrying about burning or rashes. When you first apply the lotion, it appears a whitish color, but it blends in fairly quickly and easily. It doesn't feel too thick or sticky on your skin either. Lasts a long time, too. The only reason I didn't give the product 5 stars is that it is not waterproof. As long as I stayed out of the water, I was fine. Great product for every day use."
3,Not sure yet about this product....,"I am hesitant to give 5 stars or 1 star on this product because after using it, my 9 month old still got super tan. He was not burnt (thankfully) but i did feel like i needed to apply, reapply and than reapply at least a couple more times. It seemed to run off with any water touching his skin so that is why I kept reapplying cause I did not feel confident that it was staying on. I have used Neutrogena 100 lately and he is not getting his farmers tan anymore, so i am thinking maybe this stuff is not as great at most say ?"
4,COOOOOOOOOOOOL,This is the best toy to buy for a kid that likes digimon.It is very easy to transform and it is fun its like havingtwo digimon in one.It can be gargomon or rapidmon.But I do confess the durableity isnt great but its sureFUN.
3,a pamphlet with some useful info,"This pamphlet is a combination propaganda tract, history lesson and how to manual. I read it mainly looking for tactical level guerilla combat theory and advice, of which there is some. I was disappointed in that it is somewhat vague and terse. However, I was pleasantly surprized by the included short history of the irish resistance with details from hundreds of years ago. All in all, it is worth the small investment of time and money."
1,Disappointing,"I had hoped to get some first-hand insight into the RA and its workings. Instead I got a cheap pamphlet contain recycled content. Any US Army FM on unconventional warfare or even Abby Hoffman's ""Steal This Book"" will deliver more than this."
4,Fighting the power since 1916.,"Although this book was shorter than I expected, it still offered some interesting information. It starts off with a brief lesson about the history of guerrilla warfare in Ireland and especially Ulster from before the 1798 rebellion up to the Easter Rising of 1916. It then goes on to explain in a clear, concise manner the way fighting should ideally be conducted in order to achieve certain goals. Coming from an ROTC standpoint, reading this book has improved my leadership skills, and when I become a commissioned officer in the US Army, I will remember this book and be better able to do my job."
1,FAKE!,"Serious doubt must be cast on the authenticity of this book. Other descriptions of the IRA 'Green Book' for initiates are inconsistant with this publication--the history of its publisher ('How to be a Hitman,' among other works) must also cast severe doubt on its credibility. Not for scholarly research."
1,The mindset that gave you Oklahoma City...,"The IRA must be the only ""army"" in history that has killed more of the people it purported to defend than the enemy. I put ""army"" in inverted commas because the IRA'c claim to the be the ""Irish army"" is an insult to the army of the Irish Republic, an entity established by the Constitution of the Republic of Ireland, and supported by the rule of law. The Irish people have rejected the IRA time after time , in election after election, yet it continues demanding to ride on our backs year after year. Read this, if you like, to lift a small corner of the veil on a criminal gang where thugs give each other high-sounding titles like 'Brigadier' and ""Quartermaster-General"" while sending naive young men out to cause needless slaughter. Then read Eamon Collins' ""Killing Rage"" to find out what the IRA is really about - the naked use of illicit power."
3,Cute,"If you're looking for a light and frothy quote (or one with a bit more bite), this is a great choice. If you're seeking one with weight, choose something else. The book includes a good range of contributors, with mostly familiar names (Rock Hudson, Truman Capote). Interestingly enough, it also includes quotes from 'zines and chat rooms. However, it focuses mainly on gay men and lesbians, and is fairly stereotypical in that content. If you want to enjoy some cute quips, and don't expect too much, this book should have you set!"
1,Height of Ridiculous,"This is the most ridiculous production of an opera I've seen yet. I don't love, but don't ""mind"" updates and remakes, but it helps when they have something to do with the plot. What movie crime figures and Jerusalem as theme park have to do with the Crusades escapes me. If it's a joke, it sure got by me, and definitely interfered with my enjoyment. I agree that the singing is very good, and that's what helped me listen as long as I did, but finishing it was not possible. I first bought Rodelinda by mistake, and, thank goodness for that. It was wonderful (and an update)! For Rinaldo, buy the CD."
1,Simply horrible and insulting,"After several attempts to disrespect and destroy the magic and grandeur of Handel's music (e.g. ENO's Ariodante) Mr. David Alden (stage director) has finally succeed in this German Production of Rinaldo. After watching such a pointless and ridiculous production of this beautiful opera I only can conclude that he should be in prison or in a mad house. He must have something personal against Handel. If I would be a singer of one of these operas or a Handel's heir I certainly sue Mr. Alden. Would someone explain to me what is the message in this horrible and insulting stage production? Poor David Daniels, it is pathetic to watch such a great countertenor playing as a bad clown in a even worse circus."
5,Sexy and colorful,"I love this version! Rinaldo probably isn't one of Handel's best operas - at least compared to Rodelinda and Gulio Cesare - but this is a wonderfully original, entertaining and sensuous performance. Deborah York is beautiful, full of humorous expression and feeling; from her impish Crusader entry exhorting Rinaldo, segueing to pom pom waving and flirtatious smiles, to her librarian-ish bewitchment, to her poignant and lovely imprisonment. I loved the colors, the furniture, the clothes, the sex and of course the music."
1,Handel turns over in his grave,"The only way to ""view"" this opera is with your eyes closed. Both the scenery and the acting distract from the beauty of the music. What a visual waste of David Daniels who sings magnificently. Get the CD instead."
2,contradictions on one page,".I read the sample pages. On page 6 of the book (sample page 7) the author writes: ""The things you don't get from your spouse, whatever they may be, you have to find elsewhere. And this is not, and should not seem threatening.""The advice is to be realistic and not feel threatened; 'you don't own the other person', she states.But if your partner decides to follow up on flirtations, she says on the same page, it means that something is `missing' which is a 'problem' that should be 'adressed'.While 'missing'something in the relationship wasn't at problem but something we should be realistic etc. about, it is all of a sudden a problem .Dear writer, what about: ""The things you don't get from your spouse, whatever they may be, you have to find elsewhere..?""You're advising the reader to fix something while at the same saying 'relax, nothing is broken'."
4,Excellent choice,We use the ATT E2562 Expandable base with a full compliment of 8 extra handsets. We use them in conjunction with our Vonage internet phone service which has two lines. The range is very good ... it goes all over the house and even into the neighbor's yard. It works great and gives us a lot of flexibility in putting phones where we want them.
5,At&T E252 Handset,"Received item in a timely manner. Wish product would have come with a side clip to carry around, but otherwise unit works great."
2,Expected better from AT&T,"I actually find the sound quality and range pretty good, but I think the system is designed poorly. I can't tell you how many times I have been on the phone and wanted to scroll through my caller ID to get a number for someone I was talking to. No dice, it won't do that. There are a number of issues like that. I can't program it to prefer line 2 to make calls. You may think this is a not a big deal, except I don't like to reveal the line 1 number to my clients via there caller ID. So there went my private line.Also the belt clip is worthless and after what seemed like hours on the customer support line they want to charge me $5.00 to replace it even though the phone is still under warranty. I'll try a different brand next time."
2,A Tribute to Nicolette Larson CD,"I have always loved Nicolette Larson's music. I thought I would love a CD made in her honor. I like the music of many of the people who came together to peform the concert that the CD was made from. But, the performers just didn't live up to my expectations. Jimmy Buffet gave the best performance and he is not even one of my favorite performers. CSN sounded terrible. Their harmonies were off and Stills sounded intoxicated throughout his performances. A disappointment all around."
5,Is the concert available on DVD?,Does anyone know if this concert is available on DVD? I think this is a fabulous CD and the DVD would be awesome as well. Where might I be able to find out if it exists?Thanks.
4,Great collection of 70's singer-songwriters!,"This CD has some of my favorite artists from the late 70's performing (Linda Ronstadt, Bonnie Raitt, CSN, Dan Fogelberg, Joe Walsh, Carole King, etc). Each person did a solo performance and then there were a couple 'group' numbers. The solo performances were great! The group numbers were a little rough but was still very enjoyable. This is great CD when you're in the mood for variety."
2,condition,AWESOME CD but it skips!! I played it and it did well until about the 4th song and then it started skipping the rest of the way thru it. Ruined the rest of the CD for me!!
3,good build but no data connection,"When I plug my mobile device into my computer using this cable, the computer does not recognize the device. With other cables it works fine. It does charge the device, so perhaps only some of the pins are wired through. This item is too cheap to bother with the hassle and expense of shipping it back for return or exchange. Buyer beware -- great for charging, and I'll be keeping it for emergency charging, but no data goes through it."
2,Something About it Was Missing...Chemistry,"When I read the description of this story, I was so anticipating reading it because it sounded like a really cute, funny romance. But something just didn't work. I've never not finished a book before, and I tried not to with this one by skimming ahead, but eventually, I gave up. The romance just had no chemistry, and I'm not sure how it missed, but it did. It was kind of corny, bland and cliche. I have never read this author before, but I was disappointed because the story line was cute. I was reminded of an old movie ""Housesitter"" with Goldie Hawn. I wouldn't recommend this book. Maybe it's meant for a younger reader."
4,Loved it!,"This was such a fun book to read, I didn't expect or try to predict the turn of events, I just eagerly read and enjoyed it. Lot of fun twists and turns."
1,Just so so...,I missed the other books the other review refers to. No wonder I was confused and really not interested in this book.To me it just did not have the sizzle. I honestly did not get the feeling there were sparks for love between the main characters.
2,Confusing film noir copying so many others,"""Somewhere in the Night"" is a confusing and verbose film noir, an early directorial effort by Joseph Mankiewicz. With uncharismatic John Hodiak in the lead as an amnesia victim, the film is a mishmash of confusion punctuated by some of the dumbest lines ever handed to a leading lady, starlet Nancy Guild, a Gene Tierney look alike. There are isolated good moments and some excellent supporting actors but the overall effect is tedium and disorder. This film needed stars like Bogart and Bacall and a director like Howard Hawks to pull it off! A ruthless editor would have helped too.The print of the film is excellent and since film noir has such a cult following, the DVD gets a commentary from noir expert Eddie Mueller. Mueller is realistic about the film's weaknesses."
3,Interesting Crime but Lacking in Background,"If you are a true crime reader who enjoys the twisted and sordid details of the crime and the crime only, this will be a perfect read for you. I, on the other hand, am most enticed by the ""what makes people tick"" syndrome; therefore, being that scarce information on Farah Fratta's background was provided and nothing at all was provided about Bob Fratta's background, I was disappointed.That aside, Bob Fratta is one of the most deranged individuals I have ever read about; and I've read about many. This book essentially follows the murder that was the result of a child custody battle between the Frattas after Farah revealed the sexual perversions of Bob in a deposition and he learned she would most likely receive custody and he would have to pay child support.It's an interesting read because readers see one more narcissistic, inflated ego ex-cop sentenced to death for what he thought was ""the perfect crime."""
1,A Travesty of Literature,"No Safe Place is one of the worst books that I have yet to read. The writing is clunky and sloppy and I rarely had any clue what was going on or why I should care about it. I never really got to know any of the people because there was no in-depth analysis of these people. The reader is only told that Farah is good and Robert is bad. The author gives the reader little credit for having a mind of his or her own.The saddest part about this book is that the poor woman who was murdered deserved better than Bill G. Cox could give her. This book could have been a testament to her bravery and to her life. Instead, it's a badly written, boring travesty of true crime literature."
1,Not the best book I've read,This is actually one true crime novel that I didn't finish! This book was very boring. The author gave me almost no insight into the victim's life and personality. I had a hard time getting involved because the book reads almost like a court testimony. It is a very dry book with redundant facts. How many times does the author have to tell us Mr. Fratta asked someone if they would kill his wife? Save your money.
1,The Worst Book I've Ever Read,"I'm writing this review to warn people to avoid this book like the plague. It's terrible! Actually, it's an interesting story, but the writer did nothing to dig deep into it. The second half of the book is basically court testimony that has not been put into any kind of context. A tale of a repulsive person not told particularly well. After reading it, I can honestly say it was the worst book I've ever read."
4,Bitter Sweet Receipt,"As many others have mentioned this product has a nice looking package etc etc. HOWEVER, content is lacking and i feel that the BBC sold a ""false billof goods"" in calling this DVD qualityWhere is the improved picture quality?Where is 5.1 or DTS sound track?Who got wild with the editing scissors?Luckily I am just replacing a lost DVD copy so am awaiting the 25th anniversary O2 arena on Blu Ray slated for a spring 2011 release in USA NTSC"
5,Just the Best,"There can be no other form on stage of Les Miserables. This is simply the best. Great score, huge talent and beautiful voices. I watch it again and again. This particular version will be a collectors item in the future."
5,Les Miz in Concert Rocks!,"I watched the original PBS presentation a few years back and loved it then. Recently, I rented it from Netflix and once again was captivated. I decided then and there that I would buy the disk so that I could watch it anytime I wanted. I have seen the stage production at least four times and is one of my favorite musicals of all time. I love that the concert version features all of the actor/singers who have played Valjean all around the world. The timelessness of Victor Hugo's immortal tale of the French revolution, and the story of Jean Valjean brings me to tears every time. The inclusion of Lea Solonga who plays Fantine is inspired. When she sings the haunting ""On My Own"" it is worth every penny spent on the DVD and makes this the perfect concert. My only disappointment is that LES MISERABLES is not available in Blu-ray. To anyone who loves musical theatre it is a must-own DVD."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,"In observing other reviews of this product, I must have received one of the recent editions after the problems had been corrected because I thought the performance, video and sound quality were outstanding. My equipment is of mid-range quality, so maybe the 2.0 Dolby doesn't get as critically exposed as with state-of-the art equipment. I often play my CD's on my TV player because the clarity often eclipses my Bose Wave Radio, so unless my hearing in my old age is worse than I thought, the product I received is of reputable quality. Additionally, I experienced no ""grainy video"" as others have reported. It was sharp and brilliant! And this cast with Quast and Wilkinson bearing the banner is by far my favorite overall ensemble!"
3,Who edited this show??,"The performances are unquestionably good.But...my expectations were set--perhaps unfairly--high due to the fact that I'd first received and listened to the symphonic version Les Miz cd. (Which contains every note and lyric from the play.)So, while I enjoyed what this dvd contained, I was equally disappointed by scenes and sequences which were omitted. As another reviewer mentioned, some of the omissions were particularly jarring, such as having the first third of ""Little People"" clumsily lopped off.I was somewhat mollified by the special features cd, which contains some nice clips from stage productions around the world."
5,FANTASTIC!!,"Saw this live years ago. Couldn't forget it, but this brought it all back in HiDef, up close and personal, with a Dream Cast!!! Could not have been better!!! At first I played it every day in the background of my housework. Also share it with others who love this musical. THE BEST EVER!!"
2,Unskippable Trailers on this disk,WARNING!!! UNSKIPPABLE TRAILERS AT BEGINNING OF DISKYou have been warned.I paid good money for this product. I own the disk. Why should I have to watch the same ads every time my family wants to watch the disk? The actual content was quite good after the trailers. Buy something else if you value your time.
4,10th Anniversary DVD,The DVD is awesome and the singers are incredible. Only negative I can see is that at times the sound quality isn't the best. It's definitely good enough and I highly recommend this DVD to all Les Miserables lovers.
2,Not a good idea,I think that the possibility of giving a critique on the Cd is not possible because The CD is on the American Sytstem and will therefore not play on my Pal system I am at the moment trying to find a system whereby I may be able to play CD.Regards Ed Kay.
3,Unexpected,"First off, I was happy to receive this item so quickly. It took less than a week to get it. The only real complaint I have is that it isn't the actual movie. This is Les Mis set on a stage with a row of microphones at the very front that the actors come up and sing into. I didn't understand this I guess. I thought that I was buying either the movie or a real stage production of the show. I LOVE Les Mis and it is a good quality but not what I was expecting at all."
3,un playabel,"The product on itself is fantastic. Just make shure if your ordering from Europe, that you buy a playable version of the product. I din't and i'm stuck with a dvd 'wrong region', only playable whit american DVD-players."
2,Les Miserables - The 10th Anniversary Dream Cast in Concert at London's Royal Albert Hall,"There is a few glitches in the DVD but I am not going to pay to send it back when it should have come to me in perfect, new condition. I was not very happy about it."
5,Les Miserables !0th Anniversary Concert,This is a great video you can learn alot about Le Miz by watching the special feature's. If you love this musical I recremend that you buy this video.
4,Not The Play!,"If you know the music of Les Mis, and want to appreciate the songs themselves, only, this is a superb buy. But it is NOT the play. I have made this mistake twice. I do think that the ""10th Anniversary Dream Cast in Concert"" could easily be taken to mean that this is a film of the play itself which it is NOT. Perhaps they should change the wording. I feel a bit duped, and now can't seem to find this performance on DVD anywhere; a pity, it's a long way to London for us!"
4,Very good,When I ordered the DVD I thought it was the play but instead it's a command performance of the actors singing the songs in order of the musical tho it was not what I was expecting I enjoyed it
1,DVD quality is poor,The best part of the DVD is the pre-view of BBC new drama. The quality of the main content of the DVD 'Les Miserable' was impossible to view. Lots of lags happened in the films. I could not watch at all.The DVD delivery and return process was smooth though.
5,Great Story in music,"The performance was wonderful and well produced and directed, the story line was very close to the novel by Hugo.."
5,Bravo!,I may be a bit biased coz LeMis is my favorite musical. But the actors selected for this concert are just awesome. Sound quality on this DVD is great!
5,thanks now i need ear plugs,My wife loves the movie. She plays it all darn day. Its driving me nuts. I think i'll paint the outside of the house.
3,A bit dissapointed,"Thank you AMAZON for sending me this DVD. I was disappointed as I expected a particular track to be on this dvd, the track where all the different Viljeans from all the different countries sing ""can you hear the people sing"" and end with ""one more day"". Perhaps someone could let me know exactly which Les Miserable dvd this features on?I'm keeping this dvd as it still is one of the best musicals ever!!!Rene Best"
1,Could not watch it ment to play in England,Would not play in the USA ment for England. Was sent back. Need to indicate the area it was made for!
1,Such A Shame!,"I have the original and this. I couldn't wait for this to come out thinking it would be greatly improved with todays technology. This is worse than the original DVD offered years ago. I thought for sure the picture would be sharper and it isn't. The sound is only acceptable. Listening to Dolby 2.0 in 2009 is like listening to a worn out 8 Track tape vs. digital surround sound. What's the point? Not offering this in 5.1 in this day and age is ridiculous. My daughter has Barney DVD's with better sound. It seems the only goal here was to get it back on the market to make more money, not a better product.Here is a suggestion. If your local library has DVD's, go there and see if you can find the original and check it out. You'll be glad you did and it's free. Or worse case you can view this one if they have it without wasting your hard earned money."
3,No commercials... please!!!,"I got the 10th Anniversary concert as a present for my dad, and although I have the same complaints as everyone else (pieces cut from the production), my main grievance is with the commercials at the beginning that you cannot skip over, no matter how hard you try. These commercials for other productions last several minutes, and each time you want to watch the DVD, you must sit through them. If you spend so much on a product, you should have the option of skipping the commercials. This is the first DVD where I have had absolutely no ability to do so."
5,It just doesn't get any better than this.,"How can you go wrong? The DREAM CAST of Les Mis... Victor Hugo in the hands of Cameron McIntosh, Colm Wilkinson, Phillip Quast, Michael Ball, etc. It just doesn't get any finer or more beautiful, powerful. This production continues to set the bar for great performances. God bless them all."
4,Les Miserables in London,"For fans of ""Les Miserables"" this is a wonderful production with outstanding performers and great insight into the making of this long-running stage production."
3,Missing parts,"Just finished watching my new purchase and was so disappointed. I could not believe how many parts were missing. I remember seeing the entire production on PPS and I am sure that all the songs and parts were in the original. Am I the only one who noticed all the missing sections??? Poor Lea Salonga was hardly featured. Aside from that, the sound and picture were great."
5,Truly a dream cast,"Got the DVD to replace our very old and worn VCR. Very pleased with the purchase, and speed of delivery. We'd highly recommend this to those who enjoy the best of Les Mis."
4,Fast Service!!,thank you for the swift service Amazon!What a wonderful dvd to watch on a rainy day with the family!
4,review les mis,"did have one problem the DVD does not play in our country so I can only play it on my apple computer. did not realise when I purchased buyer beware, but the quality of this production particularily the 10th aniversary is outstanding highly recomend, prompt delivery. all good."
4,Closest Thing to the Live Performance,"Having recently seen a live performance in London, I was excited to see this 10th Anniversary performance with the original cast members on DVD. The performances, backed by a full symphony orchestra and chorus were excellent and reminded me of how majestic and emotionally involving this play is. I especially appreciated the positive, for a change, image of Christianity presented and the themes of forgiveness and atonement that give emotional impact to the story. The video quality is a little less than current standards due to the age of the original recordings and those not familiar with the play may not be able to follow the story, since only the songs are performed. However, for those already familiar with the play, this is as good as it gets! Highly recommended."
3,Widescreen...finally!! But only in stereo??,"I have the previous DVD release of this concert, and I love the music and sound, but the picture quality was a big disappointment: it's quite poor on an HDTV since it's shown in 4:3 standard definition format. I was excited to see this widescreen release, but after reading that the audio is only in stereo, I'm going to have to pass.I have had the HD broadcast saved onto my DVR for the last two years, and it's sooo much better than the DVD. I long for a Blu-ray edition that will give this magnificent production the visual and audio treatment that it deserves."
2,En Francais?,"This is a travesty and not worth buying if you already have the original CD. Even the first DVD is better. For a REAL treat, track down the original recording in French. If you know the dialogue, you will follow the emotion of the original language for a truly superlative experience!"
1,I got ripped off,I will be returning this item - the disc skips on every CD player or computer I've tried it on. Unwatchable.
1,MISERABLE,"BOUGHT IT, PLAYED IT. AFTER THE INTERMISSION, DVD JERKED THROGH THE REST. AM RETURNING ASAP."
2,Not what I expected... at all,"I've seen Les Mis twice live. Once in London and once in NYC. It was the first play I ever went to and love every second of it.This DVD captures none of that. What it does capture is the music. However, since they are no longer have Les Mis on Broadway, I wanted to show my girlfriend the show and how wonderful it is. It is impossible using this DVD. It's all singing. While beautiful, it does nothing for storytelling. Unless you've seen the play, you will have NO idea what's going on here.That being the case, if you're just looking for the music, why not buy the Audio CD? Having the songs only as a DVD is pretty pointless. Big disappointment when I finally watched this."
1,Time took its toll on Colm Wilkinson,"I don't want to be overly harsh, but it's sadly true. Every time Colm Wilkinson opens his mouth, there's a sense of disappointment. It ruins the experience. I loved the play on Broadway. I love the CD. In the past, I felt joy and chills at the sound of Colm Wilkinson's voice. But time has taken its toll. His voice has no strength, no range, no resonance on this DVD. It's not my equipment, which is high quality. LG 47LW6500 HDTV. OPPO BDP-93 Blu-ray. Marantz SR7005 A/V receiver. Aperion 5T & 5C speakers & 10D subwoofer. It's not my personal taste. All the other performers are very enjoyable.I wish I could be more positive. I have very fond memories of what had been."
2,"Excellent Singing, Poor Format","Frankly, I found this product can do little but disappoint. The singing is, of course, superb; however, this is a CONCERT, not a real production. Seeing the actors standing on a stage in front of microphone can't possibly do the work justice (especially after having seen the musical on Broadway). Personally, I think purchasing a recording would be far more effective since it won't provide the negative imagery of the characters standing on stage not engaging each other in any meaningful way (not to mention the recordings of this performance can be found at far more reasonable prices)."
4,Where are the subtitles?,"I bought the DVD of ""Les Mis"" to replace a taped version. I am completely satisfied with the DVD except for the fact that, unlike the tape, the DVD has no subtitles to describe the events of the story being depicted by the music. For anyone who has not read the book or seen the actual musical, the subtitles are necessary to completely follow the story."
4,Hardcourt Upset,"Tre explains almost exactly how I feel about this book. Except for one subject, when Tre says that you should worry about your problems I think that in this situation you should help your friend out first. Because the two of them had been best friends since youth."
5,User-Friendly tours of the lunar surface,"Easy-going writing style and illustration format makes for easy tours of some of the most interesting lunar highlights from night-to-night. This is the easiest to follow of all the books on observing the moon, and even if you are using a refractor or cassegrain telescope (with reversed image viewing) you won't have any trouble navigating your way. Best introductory book."
3,Not bad for nickelback,"Interestingly enough, the chorus consists of a monumental 3 notes. Some kind of alternate version of Mary Had A Little Lamb or something."
3,Photograph,It shows a softer side in Nickelback. It is a ok CD too much screaming. That's saying something because I listen 2 Good Charlottle and Simple Plan and all the stuff.
4,Not Your Typical Ninja Book,"In feudal Japan twins are considered bad luck, something Koji would agree with whole-heartedly. His twin seems to always be just a little bit better, while Koji feels he can't seem to do anything right. When his twin saves a rich merchant's life, Koji is surprised when his parents choose him to become the apprentice. After failing with the merchant, Koji runs away only to be captured by Ninjas, or, as they call themselves, blades of grass. The book begins somewhat slowly and focuses heavily on the culture of Ninjas, so it will not appeal to readers who wish for constant action. It is however very strong historical fiction and will leave the reader knowing far more about the fascinating world of Ninjas."
4,A great book for all children,"This is a great book for children of all ages. It has action suspense and everything a good book needs. First of all you meet Koji and you learn that he is not as good at things as his brother, which in turn he loses some respect from his parents. All through the book Koji is met with challenges that he overcomes, which may help some in their real life. The action starts rather early in the book and continuers right in to the end. I really liked how they explained life around camp, I don't know much about ninjas but this stuff seems really believable. The author really gets detailed about the training and missions Koji faces. The only thing about this book that made me a little disappointed is how quickly it ended I felt the author could of added more or something. As I said before I recommend this book to anyone.S. Bricker"
5,off to real war,"The reviewer who was unhappy that no happy times were shown most likely never served. I spent a year in a different war zone with a different kind of soldier (draftees). While our experience was different, I thought this film captured the tedium and fright of the real thing. Military recruiters won't like this film but high schoolers contemplating enlistment would do well to watch this. And PS: very few citizen soldiers (as opposed to happy killers) find war much fun. Being in combat may have its moments of exhileration - survival or winning a fire fight - but it is not a happy experience."
5,Inside look,"I have greatly appreciated these DVDs. It has been very interesting, and surely moving (as far as I'm concerned) to take an inside look at the lives of these soldiers from Arkansas. The war in Iraq is not well understood here in Italy and it is hard to find such documents, excerpts from real life. I wish the Italian media would buy and write about what America really is and fights for.Thanks"
3,Should have mentioned you only had 3 episodes instead of all 10,only three episodes instead of ten... should have wrote that... idk still a good show i will purchase the rest from someone else
2,Overzealous publisher,"Being intimately familiar with the original publication of this trilogy, I can say with utmost disdain that whoever was responsible for taking the liberties of rewriting what was very nearly perfection must have a great fondness for soap operas and should stick with romance novels instead. Not only are there additional passages inserted that were never written by Conrad Richter, there are also altered meanings of existing passages that totally change the flavor and the original intent. There are so many instances in all three volumes that I don't even know where to begin with examples. This is by far the most appalling reprint of an award-winning piece of historical fiction I have ever witnessed. You would do better to find a used copy from the original publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc."
2,"Worst ""Rosenkavalier"" on Disc","Von Stade is probably the best Octavian among the fine sopranos who have recorded this role. Unfortunately, Evelyn Lear is so far past her prime that she may qualify as the worst of the Marschallins, and Ruth Welting is outclassed by every recorded Sophie (yes, I've heard them all). DeWaart's tempi are sometimes laborious, seemingly to accomodate Lear's vocal problems. The supporting cast is seldom more than adequate; the Marianne is a horror. Bastin's excellent Ochs gets rather lost in the noise. Von Karajan (Schwarzkopf) is still the best, with Solti (Crespin) a very close second. For the budget conscious, the live recording with Janowitz, Minton, and the superb Lucia Popp on Opera d'oro beats this recording by miles."
2,A nice choice (maybe) for von Stade's fans,"The blistering two-star review below has the facts right but may be too harsh in its judgments. Von Stade has countless fans who might want to hear her at her freshest in 1976 as Oktavian, and there's a passing glimpse of Jose Carreras as the Italian tenor. De Waart conducts deliberately; he wins good playing from his Rotterdam orchestra and warm sonics from Decca. But Bastin's voice is too lean for Baron Ochs, and his German pronunciation is stilted, as are his attempts to be Viennese. Welting is adequate as Sophie. The real question as to listenability is Lear's fragile Marschallin, whose fading voice actualy helps develop the image of a vulnerable, aging woman, too old for Strauss's conception but still touching.In the end, there's too much wrong to make this a good Rosenkavalier, but the intimate scenes between Von Stade and Lear have their moments."
4,Introductory Biotech text,"This is a decent and easy enough to follow introductory text to basic molecular biology techniques. It's used in my Biotech class, and I like how the protocols clearly give you every step as well as cite reference papers. However, this book would not be enough just on its own as a textbook. This should be treated as a lab manual. It provides a cursory introduction and background for each protocol listed, but the information is very brief. You'll need an actual molecular biology/biotechnology textbook to understand the principles if you are a beginning student."
4,Oxford-River English-Thai Dictionary plugs the gaps,"At last an excellent and truly comprehensive English Thai dictionary. Arguably its best feature is the wealth of common expressions it includes under most listed words, expressions that frequently have no literal construction or translation but are essential to easy and natural conversation. The alphebetically positioned special explanation panels - eg. forms of address in letter writing, the use numerals etc. - are a very worthwhile inclusion as well. One suggestion for the next edition would be a phonetic rendition of the primary Thai translation of the listed English word - given the implied vowels that feature in many Thai words this improvement would be warmly welcomed and at least for this reader would immediately propel his rating from four to five stars."
5,"Now, it makes sense!","Many times I've heard about the Zohar in my life, stories and contradicting concepts.Reading the Rav Berg's book made so much sense to me and put all the pieces of the puzzle . Now I know that It's not only about the Bible and religious matters, it's much more th a n that, it's really all that is around us, It's the ""Whys"" that I personally had in life.Rav Berg put it all in a language that everybody can understand and you the reader can decide how deep you want to go with it."
5,Actually Readable and Understandable,"Rav Berg has actually written a book on the Zohar that I can understand. So often books on the Zohar are cryptic and in the weeds so deeply that it is easy for me to become lost.For me, this was a good book to become acquainted with the Kabbalah, something that I have heard much about and was a mystery to me.I especially liked discovering that the Tree of Life is up side down: Its roots are in heaven and its branches are in this world.I also liked the idea of re-establishing connections to the highest, divine levels that once existed.And, finally, I liked the contrast of receiving for oneself alone versus receiving to share with others. What a simple and profound distinction. I find ways to use it everyday.Well done."
5,The most impactful book on kabbalah,This is the most clear and consise book that I have ever read on the Zohar. It is now very clear to me how and why to use the Zohar to better my life. I loved reading this book. I feel that it has changed my life in such a profound way. Something that I have been looking for for such a long time is now accessible. The invaluable wisdom of this book has already helped me to remove a lot of the chaos I have been experiencing until now. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who has any questions about life.
1,This book should be called Totally Un-essential Zohar,"There are many great books on Kabbalah and unfortunately this is not one of them. If you are interested in magic and red strings than Berg is the author for you. This book is a totally misinterpretation of the Zohar. If you are interested in Kabbalah for big kids, than check out The Complete Idiot's Guide to Kabbalah (Complete Idiot's Guide to) or other books by Kabbalist Rav Michael Laitman, Phd. It will lead you down a true path to Spirituality as opposed to Berg's path of Commercial Kabbalah."
3,A start to research,it is a good starting point for who doesn't know anything about Kabbalah and hebrew language. After it....
3,A curious but elementary chronolgical narrative,"This small book is a relatively quick read that provides a good, simplistic overview of the rise and development of public mass transit in the USA. There are enough factual tidbits and illustrations to assist the reader in digesting this basic treatment of how ever-changing transit vehicles helped to populate/expand many of our US cities. This particular book is what it is--and little more. Yet, it is worth a look! The good news is that this title can be found online in various conditions [from new and like new to good or fair] for reasonable cost. [ASIN:0195132297 Straphanging in the USA: Trolleys and Subways in American Life (Transportation in America)]]"
5,Very helpful,The book has full of important information and very easy to read. The instructions are also very easy to follow with lots of pictures.
2,so so,"While Failor's book has some very detailed instructions, she makes the process of hand crafted liquid soap more difficult than it needs to be."
3,Stop! This isn't a book for beginners!,"This is a very well written book but the making of liquid soaps should not be used as a group craft project. There are a number if ingredients used for ph neutralization that must be bought from reputable chemical supply houses; forget about the local craft store. And then you have to remember you are working with lye derivatives and heating alcohol over an open flame... Read this book carefully first before you try it out! There's also a lot of chemistry involved that, while not overly difficult to understand, may throw a lot of people. If you have experience with hot or cold process soap making (not that pre-made melt and pour stuff), then this is a decent book for you.The book has excellent visiual references and equally outstanding suggestions for packaging. While the visual aids are nice, they take up a huge percentage of the book as just filler making this a rather ""light"" book"
2,"Interesting, but not practical","After making cold process soap for several several years, and working in product development for a major soap company, I must say that this book is interesting, but not very practical and certainly confusing. I suppose I need more science to really understand this process. I found the soap to be very drying, with a ""fat"" smell that was really hard to cover. Also, the shelf life was not very long."
2,making natural liquid soaps,"I was very excited when I bought this book I couldn't wait to get home and start making my very own soap! Than I opened the book and was thoroughly confused! Terrible editing, Awful directions, that often have no rhyme or reason! I have ruined 3 batches of soap already. I have read the book from front to back 5 or 6 times and only after 2 of my friends and I sat down together and read the entire book together did we finally start putting together what the author is so poorly trying to teach you! I do not recommend this book unless you are prepared to spend hours trying to decipher it!"
2,The not so natural soap makeing,"I have read other books which don't use things like postassium hydroxide, sulfonated castor oil, and borax. Plus this book dosen't tell you that buying some of these items will get your name placed on a watch list."
3,Soap making and more,"After looking through this book, I do not have the time to make by own soap, shower gel & such. Pretty disappointed."
1,Rip-off,"This book is a rip-off. If you want simple, easy recipes to follow, don't buy this book. This book gives a lot of useless information and is poorly written."
1,Visually pleasing...but not much else!,"I am an experienced cold process soap maker (having made dozens of batches in the last 2 years), but wanted to add liquid soaps to my line of products. Because I wanted to do it from ""scratch"", I bought this book. It was so confusing! I couldn't follow it at all. I have to agree with the other person about Cavitch's directions--so much easier to understand!"
3,Making Natural Liquid Soaps,"This book was informative, and it has excellent visual aides but I found it to be very confusing in parts. There are two basic methods described and these methods have variations. One method actually takes two days to prepare the soap which was not clearly stated from the start.The explainations on discounting,oil sap rates and the basic mechanics of soap making were excellent, and while the information was useful, it certainly could have been grouped better to ease in the use of the book.I certainly hope the author will make a revised version of this book, but until that time, this is a great reference for liquid soap making. I would encourage you to read it through several times to make sure you have a full grasp of what you need to have on hand and to make notes so that you don't have to flip through the book to locate information while making your soap."
