5,This gripe water works!,We have tried others and it did not help our eight-months-old. My parents mentioned that they gave me Woodward's when I was a baby. We give our baby this and it helps him burp within minutes.
1,They look nice but...,"Don't work well. As at least a couple of others have suggested, do not waste your money on these lights. My issue: terrible, faulty motion detector. They seem to be ultra-sensitive. Mine will turn on when someone drives by with their sub-woofer cranked up...and it's worse in colder weather. I've had to leave them turned off so it doesn't look like I'm having a light show.I bought them because I needed some new lights, thought the extra security the montion detectors offered was great, AND the price was extremely low. Yet, again, I was reminded that you get what you pay for."
4,Pretty Ring,"What else can you say. It's a pretty ring, and it was inexpensive. The ring looked just like the one in the photo. Silverbin ships quickly and is OK in my book."
2,Would have been nicer if it lasted longer,"Bought and installed in May '11, stopped working Jan '12. The locking mechanism no longer locks. I now get a""check fuel cap"" warning indicator. Oh well."
4,ed,"What can one say, it locks, it locks the gas tank? I do not like the shape of the key head. I wish it said ""gas"" on it like the last one. It keeps the gas in and unwanted persons from taking the gas. It works fine. Thanks."
1,Stant 10507,Its wasn't what I thought it would be. The end of the cap isn't like the factories gas cap! Found the proper gas cap at Baxter auto part store. That is the one that fits a true Honda Civic as the factory.
3,New Testament Theology and Themes,"i think this book should be called a book on themes instead of theology. Marshall spends majority of his time on the thematic aspect of the New Testament and the words used by him are engrossed in his own theology of Arminianism. However, they are very insightful and he clearly illustrates the themes in such a way that helps you remember the books more easy"
1,Burned Out,I went through 6 of these in a Mazda5 in less than two years. Replaced with Philips with comparable light and no burnout in a year.
4,Better than the stock bulbs,"I installed a set for my 02 WRX. They look a little whiter and brighter than stock's. It is ok for this price. I also found out the stock bulbs in the WRX already had Sylvania bulbs when I installed this 9007ST. The Sylvania makes the OEM bulbs for WRX. This brand seems last very long. The old set was used in the past 4 years, and now I just keep them in the car as a back up."
5,Great lights,I purchased these for my car 36 dollars at walmart. Work great but I wish I would have looked on here first and got the Ultras (Next ones up) for the same price! These are still great lights at a good price.
5,"Laughing so hard, it's hard to hold your binoculars steady","Buy this book and laugh your head off or give it as a gift to any person you would wish to see with a laughed-off head. It's funny, actually... Plus, I can really recommend the one time magnification binoculars advertised in there, no more looking in the wrong side seeing everything so annoyingly small... Tea kettle tea kettle..."
4,Beyond Birdwatching,"I bought this book as a gift, but also had the chance to read it. Parts of it were pretty funny, however I felt that overall it was too long. I'd suggest to the authors that if they create another similar book, they consider focusing on only a few aspects of birdwatching. But none of that is a reflection on the seller. The purchase price, speed and shipping, which are within the control of the seller were all excellent."
3,"""missing links"" in logic","Just finished this book and found it to be interesting but also found that Hughes makes some huge jumps in logic. Pulling bits and pieces from the Bible, Greek mythology, and the Enuma elish (Sumerian creation story), he makes grand assumptions that certain proofs have been made without going through all the steps to tie them together.All and all Hughes does make an interesting case that has as much if not more validity than any other creation story."
3,You've been warned,"Debris, Inc. is, for all intents and purposes, a duo consisting of Saint Vitus leader Dave Chandler and ex-Trouble bassist Ron Holzner, along with help from some friends. If you haven't heard anything else about Debris, Inc. yet and you're expecting something along the lines of a ""Saint Trouble"" or Saint Vitus part 2, think again. Instead, what you've got here is an old-fashioned punk record. Included are covers of X's ""Nausea"" and Fear's ""I Love Living In The City"". There are some doom-ish moments, but not enough to satisfy anyone expecting a Doom super-group. That's ok by me. I gave this 3 stars because this album isn't mind-blowing, or even very original, but its definitely the sound of 2 friends having fun and playing music they enjoy. Plus, I love Chandler's guitar. The band rocks pretty well although the production is pretty raw. If you are a doom fan who likes punk, too (or vice versa), you'll probably find something to enjoy about this disc."
5,Fantastic resource for modern and historical names,"This book is well designed and well organized, offering a unique service. With its pronunciation guide, serves as a great introduction to Sanskrit, as well as mythology. Highly recommended!"
3,Dictionary is what it is,"Well, when I bought this book, I though it would help me find a name. But the name listings are not as many as I thought would be. What this book is...is a dictionary. If you know what the meaning of a name is, then use this book as a reference. I did not find it real helpful to find a baby name."
1,Poorly researched collection,It has many erroneous entries. Many names listed here are not of Sanskrit origin.
4,Another Maxie and Stretch mystery,"I waited anticipatorily for this book - love the ""older"" protagonist and her trusty sidekick. I was, however, disappointed at the end of the book as I found that the denouement was weakly done. I had to re-read the final chapters several times to figure it out (and I am a real estate lawyer!). It was just not sufficiently fleshed out. I still gave it four stars because of the wonderful character developemnt throughout the plot and the well-paced story until the thud of the ending."
2,wake me when something happens,almost as much fun as watching your own hemroidectomy ! I'reacd and enjoyed several Sue Henry novels--this was definately NOT one of them.
2,Confusing plot,"I have never read any of Wilcox's books before so I can't compare them. While he has an ear for dialogue, I kept getting lost in the plot and the relationship of the characters. I know this was supposed to be a funny book, but the protagonist was too much of a sad sack to invite any identification for the reader and the lines weren't snappy enough to get me laughing. Instead I felt sorry for ""Lou"" while not really liking her that much. I kept wanting to stop reading the book as it didn't seem to go anywhere in the plot. The ending confused me, as it did another reviewer. So my recommendation is pass on this one and try another of Wilcox, as the author seems to be quite popular."
3,Janis Joplin Final 24 Hours,"Janis Joplin - Final 24: Her Final Hours film is in a documentary format alternating biographical bullet-points, some stage footage and recreations of Janis behavior. It is sad to see that such talented person life was cut short by alcohol and drugs addition."
5,"Nice big handle, solid construct, lightweight but not flimsy","Nice big handle, solid construct, rounded edges but not as ergonomic as a Kupo.Overall great product that arrived on time.Not much else to add."
1,LIES,"More creationist rubbish. Dishonest arguments,shamefully distorting the truth by pretending to adhere to scientific principles."
1,"Amazon, get a life","Gish is an insult to the pulp industry.The prior review, calling this porno is too nice, it overstates the level of Gish's ""work""."
1,Continuation of real pornography.,"I reviewed one of D. Gish's books in 1972, and I hoped, even prayed that thispseudo-intellectual would obtain some grasp of reason, logic, and foremost - SCIENCE--\Over the years I have had the duty, and it has not be a pleasant one, to review for certainschool boards, books submitted by or on behalf of the ""christian right"" in their continued attemptto push the creationite dogma into the schools. Among these books D. Gish's diatribe and abuse ofscience, in reality, pseudo-science, is often submitted as some claim that this religious assertionhas some ""scientific basis"". If the written word can be so brutalized and the field of science somisstated and abused, the same can only be termed ""PORNOGRAPHY""/ It is my opinion that a childwould be better off viewing a Penthouse or even Hustler magazine than being subjected tothe anti-intellectual diatribe put out by the christian reich like Gish, the ICR and their ilk."
4,15 ft. USB cable,"It was exactly as expected. There really is not too much to say about a 15 ft. USB cable., is there?"
3,Could've Been Better,"I was really glad to be able to get this,but I would've enjoyed it more if the concert footage had focused more on him than the audience.The backstage footage was fun,but all the short clips of him singing made me want to see more and since I didn't get that I was left somewhat dissatisfied with the whole thing.I'm still glad I got it,although I wish I'd known more about what I was getting beforehand.This guy is incredible to see and hear.I've never seen anyone put more energy into a performance and still have that kind of vocal power."
4,Intense,"The Tomasz Stanko Quartet comprises Marcin Wasilewski on piano, Slawomir Kurkiewicz on bass, Michal Miskiewicz on drums, and of course, Tomasz Stanko on trumpet. This is a tight group that has played and toured together often, a group that is not afraid to take some chances in improvising, yet who seem to love spinning entrancing webs of melody and rhythm. The cuts on Lontano vary in tempo and style, but consistent throughout is the sheer intensity of the playing. That is not to say the music is relentless and loud and pounding; indeed, the playing is often soft and tender--but it is an intense softness, an intense tenderness, deep and smoldering and soulful. If you are a jazz fan who has not yet picked up on Stanko's sound, Lontano is a great place to start."
5,imagine the most beautiful ghosts,the most hauntingly beautiful music i've ever heard. it reaches deep into your soul and makes you weep with joy as well as sadness. every one should hear this music.
2,Do Not Buy Without Listening First ..,"i think tomasz stanko and this quartet are fantastic and the last two albums - soul & night - are great, great, great. stanko is my favorite trumpet player the the trio esp piano are hot and original. they are now defining jazz because the american musicians have not done anything in recent years. ecm is the hottest jazz label ever.with that - i bought this in pre-release and just got it and i have listened to it only twice and i just don't like it. it feels like no structure - like warm up material and there really is no tempo.so - if you like this then theoretically you should melt when you listen to sould & night. enjoy your music"
1,Junk DO NOT BUY THESE CAMERAS,I bought one these from ebay. The batteries do not hold a charge more than 10 minutes and then they will not recharge.I went to the manufacturers website and contacted tech support. They did send me two batteries. One will not charge at all and the one that did charge did not hold t more than a few minutes. I can not find these batteries in any local store or battery stores online. SO I have a dead camera.
1,Crappy product and equally crappy service,"Purchased the item in Oct 2007 as a gift for my nephew who lives in Trinidad. Camera lasted for about a month then just could not come on (similar to the experience of other reviews seen). Notified adamsworld (amazon seller) about the problem but was told that return period for refund was passed. I was given instructions on where to send camera for repair/replacement which I forwarded to my nephew by email. My nephew did not want to risk mailing the item from abroard and was waiting for someone travelling to US to bring over and mail within US.That is happening next week. Nephew however lost instructions on where to send the camera and now that I have requested information again from seller, cannot get any response. Surely ther must be some product guarantee for this item!This camera and service from seller seems a terribleMPEG 4 Digital Video Camcorder Digital Video Camerachoice."
2,Volly Ball opinion,"Net supports are great; however, net was described as fitting pools up to 20 foot. My pool is only 18 foot wide and actual net covered 2/3 of pool width, with the balance of space just air between the ties."
5,Water Volleyball game,"Order came on time. Product was great for what I wanted. Pleasure doing business with this company!I don't have anything to compare this product with, but will enjoy it with friends."
5,A parents keepsake,"This is the sweetest thing I've ever seen. I love Anne Geddes work, and I don't have children yet, but I thought I would buy this so when that special time comes I will have the cutest keepsake journal around."
1,"I'm not a kid, I just haven't got an account",I was quite hopeful for this song because the intro is good but then she starts talking about rubbish! This really shouldn't be childrens music. Buy her first single but not this!
1,Proof that the industry is brainwashing us with rubbish..,"Come on guys.. ""you make me want to la la?""WOW !! how insightful!!!This single and its awful lyrics bring a newlevel of stupidity to music....STOP LISTENING TO WHAT ""THE MAN"" SHOVES DOWNYOUR THROATS AND LISTEN TO SOMETHING DECENT..YES!!! There is music out there that isnt heardon the radio or seen on Mtv...!!!"
3,You gotta check this one!!!!!,"The opening sequence is super awesome & fast paced! After that, you gotta find things in the movie to laugh about & stay entertained! If you are a die hard Kung fu fan....you'll find sonething enjoyable here! Happy viewing! Keep it ""celestial""!!!!"
5,best reference around,"My daughter found this book at the library, and we HAD to buy one to keep! Where else but Amazon could we get such a treasure, hardcover, for under $2????The thing I like best about this book is the way the designs are organized. There are multiple items under each category (like animals or professions or vehicles or household items, etc.) It is simple to find ideas to personalize a project for anyone. We were able to easily use the designs and even modify them a bit to match the person we were sewing for (like changing the color of the uniform and adding a beard to depict my mailman husband...)"
2,Alzheimers Clock,"I had this clock for my brother who is in a nursing home. The clock works okay, but the numbers do stick. I recently ordered one from the Alzheimer website. It is a little more expensive, but it is fully digital and works great. It has the giant day & date, plus a large time display."
1,Save youyr money!,"Ordered for father-in-law and received broken, was returned and credit and etc. worked out fine. Don't waste your money, read a review that they also received one broken, so must be a common problem!"
5,terrific clock calender,"this is one great clock for any office or home. It gives you the day, date and time. It even gives you the AM or PM. Great for the office where people write checks and ask what the date is. You have the big clock right there to just look up and tell them. I have another one right by my desk where I can just look up and see what day it is because I am always forgetting what day of the week it is. It is visible from a pretty big distance. I really like this clock. Worth every penny."
2,um not really my style,"um what can i say about it, it smells a bit strong, its a very mature scent and a bit flowery, personally i find it has me smelling like a 50yr old man, a nice 50yr old but i'd rather smell a little less old >_>. i guess its one of those scents that you may not like but women will LOVE on you kinda thing. i say give it a test run if you get the responses you looking for then by all means, if you like stuff like cool water and hugo boss energise then this may not be for you. =("
2,Tobacco like,I don't have like it and I don't recommend to anyone. You wear this for a date with a non-smoker female you will regret it.
5,all one senior review,I've used this product for several years and love it. I have never found a better quality powdered vitamin and mineral on the market. The person who said it had a bad smell to it must have something wrong with their nose. It is pretty much odorless.
3,Better to Join Weight Watchers,"I personally think the book was just merely ok. If you are not already on a diet plan of some sort, I doubt if it will be helpful. I say just join weight watchers."
4,Love this book!,"I joined Weight Watchers for the first time in February 2011. I have lost 21 lbs so far! This book, written by a physcian, is so helpful. Even though the book was written in 2005 the principles still apply to the new Points Plus system. I highly recommend it for those looking for a lifestyle change....not just another diet!"
1,Disappointing,"This book offers scientific knowledge, but does not contain any at all. It is written by a physician, anybody could have done a better job, with explaining facts. Instead of information, explanation on ascientific level you find pages over pages over pages only about weight loss in generell, things everyone knows by himself already anyway."
3,blah,"I hated this book. I'm giving it three stars because it might be me hating self-help stuff, but this was not really what i expected. It's a feel good book and doesn't really give you specific tips or anything really weight watchers related. waste of money in my opinion."
5,Country Perfect,John Michael Montgomery has the best sense of classic country videos. He has a variety of videos from an auction to a little cafe and the The Little Girl is a heartwarming video. John like many artist have a way of making you laugh and cry with a video collection.
5,STUNNED & AMAZED,"This is a book of poems that you will call your own. Bogen was there with you and she proves it. If there was a day you wish you had saved somehow.. ""a day you forgot your camera..."" This book is a mandatory read, and re-read. Bogen will recall & re-live what you forgot, what you miss, and why you miss it. ..then she'll take you somewhere you've never been! HANG ON!! SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!!!!!"
2,Terrible,"This text is beyond awful. Useless as a college preparatory text and not even good material for a sermon. Misquotes, mistakes of fact and a misrepresentation of the scientific method and even of the definition of science are on almost every page. Students who are subjected to a course based on this material are guaranteed to be at a disadvantage in gaining admission to any serious post-graduate program from Masters Biology to Dental Hygenics. Does no service to science and even less to the holy Book. I would recommend it as an interesting and somewhat humorous example of pseudoscience and poor editing for a comparative literature survey..... but not to be taken seriously."
1,Disappointingly Labeled,"I bought this book with the intention of teaching my young but growing brood the glories of the allfather Odin and the might of Yggdrassil, the world tree. Unfortunately, the book focuses solely on the Christian story of religion. If that is your cup of tee, then ok, I guess. I just wish that the publisher had been more thoughtful in their presentation. If I am going to teach my children iron-age mythology, I want to ensure that they only receive the most accurate information. Buyer beware."
1,Let your kid's learn real science.,"Stop contributing to bad science people. This national phenomena has got to stop. Of course real science is hard, science isn't supposed to be easy and casting the ""Goddoneit"" stone for your child sets them on a path of apathy toward scientific literacy they may not return from.If you are a real Christian then you will have no problem with teaching your kids real biology which describes God's creation. Real Christians shouldn't be purchasing books like this, which have literally-- lies written in them."
1,Garbage,"Creationist propaganda, nothing more. If you're trying to actually, ya know, learn anything, get a real textbook. One without the logical fallacies and general misinformation."
1,wow,"I mean seriously.....C'mon...how? I guess the people who do believe in this garbage claim to have little ""faith"" in Science. Well, explain how you are reading my words right now? The internet was not created by prayer, it was achieved through scientific pursuits and experimentation. Why do you put blind ""faith"" in Science when it comes to medicine or computers or automobiles, but then claim Science is wrong on Evolution?"
1,Terrible.,The author does not even have a degree in BIOLOGY. It is absolute negligence to use this text as a basis for a proper education.
3,Used with my Palm Treo 700p,"Works well when the Treo recognizes the unit.Have to often reset the Treo in order for it to be picked up.When it is picked up, works perfectly.Not sure if it is more of an issue with the Treo or the Nokia"
2,Liked it while it worked,"The headset worked at first, then it started to disconnect from my phone frequently without my doing so. I actually had my phone in my hand so I was not out of range. Then it just wouldn't turn on even after charging for a long time. I tried to get a replacement but Amazon no longer had any to sell. I am weary of purchasing the headset from a seller for $25 as it is normally priced at like $70."
4,Good piece,"I found this item useful, it is handy and its connectivity is good. I gave four stars to this product because I feel its price should have been little less."
4,Nokia BH200,"If you're looking for a headset to use while sitting in your cubicle, this is the one to choose. It doesn't blink blue where everyone can see. It has a light that blinks on the inside and no one will ever know if you're on the phone or just listen. I absolutely love it. I recommend this ear piece to all my friends and family, so its is worth a buy for you."
3,"Not bad, shame about the delay","There is quite a long delay when an incoming call is received, which is annoying as you find yourself repeatedly saying ""hello, hello"" before establishing a connection with your caller. Pairs very well with my Sony Ericsson and works fine with Skype. The earhook is weird at first but is very stable once you get used to it, even though it does look a bit Star Trekkie it is fairly comfortable, overall not a bad BT, but not great."
2,"low-cost, poor fit, and too quiet","knowing that i would soon lose something as small as a bluetooth headset, i pick up the bh-200 because it was the cheapest thing in the store.it's small and easy to put on, but the problem is that the design of the clip means that the speaker in not *in* your ear, but floats just outside your ear. because of this i could hardly hear it sometimes and it was impossible to reposition it for a better angle into my ear canal.in addition the volume control wheel sticks out too far and is very easy to accidently push. so when pulling this out of a bag or pocket the volume was almost always set to less than the max, which was already to low.on a positive note the clip is very easy to slip over your t-shirt collar or belt making it very easy to store it when not in use.oh, and it took me three months to lose it, but i did."
4,Doesn't work with Treo 700p!,"This is a GREAT headset but it didn't work with my Treo 700p! It's got a very innovatuive ear clip that catches both sides of your ear for the most stable and comfortable headset I've found. With the Treo, I could get it to connect and handle phone calls while connected, but after idle, it wouldn't stay connected. Otherwise, I would highly recommend it to users of the 650, with which I know it works very well."
2,Uncomfortable,"The biggest problem with this headset is that the elastic ear hook becomes very uncomfotable very quickly. It functions fine, with a lot less ""echo"" than other headsets. The only annoying thing on the functionality side is that it's very slow to answer from the headset. There is a noticeable delay between the time you hear your phone ring to the time you hear the little Nokia song in your headset. Then, after you hear the Nokia song and press the button to answer, there is an infuriating wait of about 2 seconds when you can hear the caller but they can't hear you. I recommend you look elsewhere for a headset."
3,nrseneedles549,"This is a good product for the price. The only thing that is a detractant that the prongs that hold the headset on are too fragile, & crack easily.. Still, was the only headset I could find that would actually connect with my cell phone.."
2,okay,This headset works ok. It doesn't hold up to everday use as some others have. Had problems losing connection at times as well. I used it with a Nokia 6165i. It's not great just ok.
1,Absolute garbage,"The design is nice and it fits and stays on pretty firmly once in place, but it's not the most comfortable for long uses (meaning over 30 minutes or so).however, it's rare I use this for more than a few minutes since the person on the other end keeps asking me to repeat myself or talk louder. the microphone performance is abysmal, the other person simply cannot hear what I'm saying. Today I finally had enough and threw this in the trash can."
2,Pairing Nightmare,"I really like the design of the earpiece and the quality for the price. My only problem, which is a biggie, is that I can not get it to pair with my phone. It will not flicker long enough for the phone to pick up the signal. I have tried pressing every button to no avail. Please help."
1,"Broke after two months, Kenneth Cole repair never fixed it","I bought this watch only to see it break two months later. Thinking it was just a dead battery we took it in for a change, and they couldn't fix it. We called Kenneth Cole and they instructed us to send it in for repair. We never saw it again.$70 down the drain.I have another Kenneth Cole watch that still works after 3 years, but it's no longer waterproof. After all this, I would stay away from this brand even if you like the style."
2,Beginning of new series...,"Kirk finds love...again. This is the first book in a series that are written by Shatner. But eventually as is usual with Kirk's love life, tragedy looms. How can any one man lose so many deep loves to death? Thank goodness he has the Reeves-Stevens help him, otherwise this would be tripe."
1,A real snoozer,"I rarely read a Star Trek book, but I was bored one day and this one at least looked interesting. Boy, was I wrong! Supposedly penned by William Shatner, this book was nothing more than ""the Captain Kirk is great"" show. Kirk (Shatner) was the hero whom everyone worshiped, and the supporting cast of Star Trek characters were reduced to little more than the Captain Kirk cheering gallery. Thanks to this piece of tripe, I'll never even consider a Start Trek novel again."
3,Has one of the things I hate most about Star Trek books.,"I haven't read this book in a while, so I can't really give much of a review about it. One thing I do remember about it is a great inconsistancy. In this book William Shatner says Admiral Cartwright was the C-in-C. In THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY a white man (named Bill Smithie in the book) is the C-in-C. William Shatner was in the movie, in scenes with the C-in-C. To me, this is like Mark Hamill writing a STAR WARS book and saying Darth Vader was the emperor! It is things like this that have made me prefer STAR WARS and BABYLON 5 books"
1,nothing like Avenger,"After reading Avenger I decided to move on to Shatner's other books. Boy, did I make a mistake! 60-year old Kirk falls in love with 20-year old Teilani and they call it a great love affair! I like it better in Avenger when Teilani is old and scarred and then Kirk still loves her. This one is nothing but sex."
1,Shun it like the plague!,"William Shatner thinks he knows Star Trek but this book serves merely to boost his ego. A 62 year old Kirk falls in love with 20 year old woman. This is the worst Trek novel I have read. I'm shunning all of Shatner's novels now,"
3,"Kirk worship, but okay for what it is","This is well-written, very readable and in places quite exciting. The plot is sound, and there are even attempts to tackle the subject of the aging hero, which might have provided a pleasant dash of seriousness. The main drawback is the painfully obvious fact that Shatner is his own character's biggest fan. The supporting characters keep extolling Kirk's superhuman qualities, and Kirk himself emerges as a demigod, even his virility revived by the passionate attentions of a stunning Klingon-Romulan a third of his age. In short, a novel with a decent premise and some fine moments but somewhat spoiled by the authors's uninhibited self-glorification. Still: the best of the bunch, by far."
4,"Shatner writes kirk good, but this is a little bumpy","I saw this book and knew I had to read it. It has an excellent plot and good story ideas but he needs to make it run a little smoother, like The Return."
5,Best book I ever read!,William Shatner is a great author. I read most all his books but this one is the greatest! I love how he protraed Kirk in this excellent novel. I just hope that he keeps on writing Star Trek novels.
4,Excelent Audio,"Although sometimes sometimes over diecriptive of some non important issues, I find Mr.Shatners book to be interesting and involving. The plot is good, and he narates well. Although I would not purchace this book (or series) in paperback format, after listening to this I have set about obtaining the sequels in CD Audio format aswell.I would certainly recomend this title if you want to go home, put your feet up, and anjoy a good trek story which comes from the mouth of one of trek's greatest icons."
4,An above average novel which surprised me.,"An above average Star Trek novel that that surprised me and had me looking forward to his next. William Shatner and his co writers Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens (of ""Star Trek - Prime Directive"" fame)! have certainly got inside the mind of one of Starfleet's greatest legends Captain James Tiberius Kirk and fleshed him out the way that no other Star Trek Novel has."
3,One last hurrah for the one and only Captain James T. Kirk,"Well Shatner certainly delivers when it comes to glorifying his character.We see here Kirk trying to recapture his youth and be the Kirk of his glory days. Rather than settling down with Carol Marcus, he decides to ride off on some crazy adventure with a strange half Klingon, half romulan girl. Typical Kirk, but you know he's ready for retirement when he shaves his sideburns. Didn't like the friction between Sulu and Chekov these guys are supposed to be friends."
3,A good present.....,"If you can think of anything else to buy for a Trekkie, buy this book. It's paperback, and doesn't use much wrapping paper"
4,despite shatner's ego it's still agood book.,"I wondered as i read this book how much of it did the captain himself really write? This book had the reeves stevens thumb print all over it. this of course means that it contains the the adictive page turning excitement. The story set in the movie era seems very much like one of the flims.The main complaint i have is that shatner's most obvious imput was in the ego department. Kirk runs off with a beautiful woman half his age,chehov facing death asks himself ""what would the captin do"", and sulu an accomplished starfleet captain could even save the day with out saying ""captain kirk had always wanted to do that"". despite shatner's ego ashes of eden is a above average trek novel"
2,Cut-n-pasted from 2004,"Unfortunately, this book is mostly a cut and paste job from the '04 edition, and a very bad one at that. For example, on several pages 'last year' refers to '03, on others it refers to '04. On page 105 Richard Virenque had won 6 polka-dot jerseys, on page 117 he won 7. I gave it a second star only because I'm a big Bob Roll fan.C'mon Bobke, you can do better than this."
4,Tour de France book--a great companion,This book really added to my enjoyment and understanding in following the 2005 tour!
2,not 100 % wool!,"This is NOT 100% WOOL as described! Smelled like smoke when arrived. When a piece of its fiber was burnt with a match - it melted and rolled into a dark little ball !!! Seller said - ""no, this is pure wool"", ""while some people think the quality can be checked by burning the fiber, the experts disagree"". The seller had no idea why it smelled like smoke, but I couldn't return the item now, since I had already washed it."
4,All in All a good blanket,The blanket is really soft and really warm and a good size the only problem I have with it is that it feels thin. All in all a good blanket.
1,I could never get this light to work,"I could not get this light to pereform, I found a used one in a garage sale made by craftmans and that is what I use. I'm not a professional and maybe I'm doing something wrong but my others lights have worked without me being a genious."
3,body glue,"This glue is great for small things like a fake nose or scare. It doesn't work on this that have any weight. If you want clown noses or fake beards, mustashes it will do just fine."
5,Marvelous,"This recording is simply a marvel. Ormandy conducts the Philadelphia Orchestra with incredible pathos. The concept is hugely romantic, the melodies and passion really come through. But there is more to this performance than emotional accents; Ormandy keeps a Bach-like eye for the big structure of the symphony. Each section is beautifully molded, equally the lilting balletic movement next to the big fanfare of the 3rd movement. The last movement is pathetic but with a grandeur and integrity that is heart wrenching.The sound is good for a 1960 recording. The fillers are also excellently played."
4,Ormandy's Tchaikovsky No.6 - well worth hearing,"This recording by Eugene Ormandy of Tchaikovsky's 6th, in my opinion, is inferior only to Furtwangler's great one from 1938. While the two conductors do it in vastly differing styles, they both get their point across quite effectively. The Philadelphia strings are, as always, beyond reproach and the sound is fine for the era."
5,Handy for SH2 players and Kriegsmarine buffs,"If you are planning to play the computer game Silent Hunter 2 (whenever it finally comes out...), you will find this little book most helpful in hunting convoys of English merchant ships... It gives a brief shakedown on the tactics used by U-Boat Captains during the Battle of the Atlantic.-Tom"
5,A Valueable 1st Hand Account,"Vaid's account of her experiences in the gay movement is invaluable for the insights and lessons it offers. Should be required reading not only for activists and gays, but for everyone everywhere."
1,Waste of Paper and Ink,"This book is a polemic by an author with a narrow mind. As a gay man, I resent mightily her insistence that if you don't see issues HER way, you have no place in the Gay movement.On the one hand, Vaid expresses a ""sincere"" desire to reach out to others in the Gay Lesbian movement. On the other hand, she silences those, like the great Bruce Bower, who disagree with her."
3,KN Intake Kit,It was relatively easy to install except that they should have provided larger clamps. I went to an auto part store and bought some because the ones they gave were impossible to put on. It gives a decent rumble but nothing to brag about. It increased my gas mileage by about 1-2 mpg. Not sure it was worth the money to put on just to say my truck has one on. Its a good product but not sure if it is necessary. Probably wouldn't buy another if I get a second truck.
2,Its good for the sound.,"I bought it for my 07 Tacoma and it was easy to install. It gave the truck a nice sound when passing. It said to give 10 more HP at 4900 rpm's, but Im never that high into my rpm's.After having it on my truck for a week and reading more about it on some tacoma forums I decided to return it. Paying $200 for sound was just a little to much for me. So if you are buying it to have little rumble when you pass then its great, but dont buy it for anything other than sound.A little side note, while reading about my truck on Toyota forums technically Toyota's come stock with a Cold Air Intake system, you just need to replace the paper filter with a cloth one."
1,Not so great!,"So glad to see Richard and Elizabeth together in a movie but it wasn't great.Kind of like a bad drug trip, with bad acting and set and props.But still love Richard Burton & Elizabeth Taylor ."
2,Lackluster - should have been so much better!,"If it was not for the stellar performance of Richard Burton this movie would be worthless. He rants and raves and practically chews up the scenery while the support cast is boring and dull. If the cast was working up to Burton's level this movie would be STUNNING! If the cast was as exciting as Taylor's bust - prominently displayed on her every entrance - the movie would be spectacular! Unfortunately, it has all the spontaneity of a bad senior class play."
2,His bias is showing,"I got this book from the library on a strong recommendation. Myheart sank when I saw the foreward was by ex-Pres Bush pere. I did get through the whole thing, but became increasingly disenchanted.Author is strongly biased in favor of what may be loosely called ""the right wing"" (not that those terms have any meaning these days!). He waxes lyrical about Cheney and Rumsfeld --writing even after their iniquities have become public. He skids lightly over misdeeds of the Cold War, especially those of the U.S. The only fairly readable parts were his thumbnail sketches of the military men he encountered during his career. As far as I'm concerned, reading this book was a waste of time."
4,One Good Read!,"I have read this book a couple of times now and purchased it for a number of friends. Not just once have people mentioned they knew or have met many of the people in the book. The people in this book did not just have a passing influence on world events, they influenced it in ways that we will be dealing with for eternity both good and bad. The ""Cold War"" as a battle between capitalism and communism is over and the capitalists won. Even in China and especially in China capitalism has lifted hundreds of millions of people into an unheard of middle class. Yet the authoritarian governmenments that remain hostile to freedom still rule a vast amount of the earth's surface and as such multiple hot and smouldering wars will remain."
2,Not very interesting,I couldn't really enjoy the book and gave up on it by chapter 5. The author seem to keep repeating certaing topics over and over and dull in telling the story. The book mostly seem like an autobiography of his life in the air force with a lot of his opinions. The book covers the Cold War but he presents it in a very tedious and slow manner. Could be better.
2,informative but self-congratulatory,"This book contained a lot of information about the Cold War, but the tone was unrelentingly self-congratulatory and put me off the book."
4,Thought provoking,At the Abyss is a quick read. I was left with the impression of how grateful we should all be for the ability of many people on both sides of the cold war to restrain themselves from creating a nuclear holocaust.
5,Very Useful!!!,I now have two of there Avenger Super Clamps. I use them quite a bit on location shoots to mount my flashes in places a stand will not fit or in small offices. Very solid and quality build. Fast shipping. If you need to hang anything in unusual places this product is for you..
1,unhappy with purchase,"unhappy with purchase, unable to use and needed to purchase locally, not a deal at all. very disappointed."
4,fine stethoscope for the price,The stethoscope works fine. I like that it came in lots of colors. The delivery was punctual.
2,Scratches...,"I like the idea of this safety blanket and the material does keep the baby warm. However, my baby girl woke up with scratches all over her beautiful cheeks from the shoulder tabs. It's a design problem and unfortunately, I will not be using this product agin."
2,Would be great...if not for the velcro,"I love sleep sacks and feel great about my son's warmth and safety while wearing them. These from Kiddopotamus are soft and roomy, BUT there are two problems with the velcro closures on the shoulders: 1. Opening the velcro is LOUD and right next to little ears; and 2. It scratches his cheeks, no matter how we try to cover the roughest part. We got rid of the Kiddopotamus ones and found others that have worked better (especially the Lullabags, except that they run small)."
5,Don't waste your $$ on those high priced cables in stores,A cable is a cable is a cable. The computer stores charge a fortune for the same thing you are getting here. This cable worked perfectly to connect my printer to my laptop.
5,It Works,I was about to buy a similar product elesewhere for much more money. This cable works just as well and costs next to nothing!
1,Startech review,"Sometimes you get what you pay for. Caveat emptor with this product. The same or a substantially similar product cost 10 times more in retail stores such as Best Buy and Circuit City. So I searched the web for discounts. I was sold after reading reviews of this product. Then I got the product after waiting for more than a week for delivery and plugged it into my computer. I got an error message indicating ""device not recognized"" or words to that effect. Apparently, it was not electronics compliant or something. I had to find a brick and mortar discount electronic store to find the same product that cost about $5 bucks more, but it was worth every additional penny that this product was not."
2,OK at best,Interesting book but very incomplete coverage of items actually produced by this exceptional company. Nice photography. Includes verbiage about designers for whom not a single image is shown.
2,Book Description is Misleading,"The book jacket description listed here is misleading. This book sheds very little light on any of the individual Maryland families mentioned in the title. Its focus is on wealthy colonists as a class with little emphasis on the individual families. Furthermore, it is not really a study of the 'Maryland' elite as the title says, because it primarily limits itself to only two counties in Maryland. The book might be interesting to historical sociologists but I doubt that anyone wishing to learn details of old Maryland families would be satisfied with this purchase."
3,Exner Workbook,"The workbook provides a good introduction to scoring and structural summary construction. It is, however, already outdated because it does not include some of the indices on the current structural summary forms. It provides a number of good scoring examples. However, some of the scoring does not adhere to Exner's rules for scoring, which has been quite confusing for my students. He explicitly states that determinants should not be scored unless they are clearly articulated by the respondent, but proceeds to occasionally ignore this guideline. This certainly does not help to develop solid interrater reliabilities."
4,Very helpful,The workbook is much clearer than the text. It goes step by step through the coding process. The best part is included in the back are over 250 responses and their coding. This really helps to understand
4,GOOD DOCUMENT OF 1985 TOUR SETLIST,"Buyers beware - the volume dynamics on this recording vary somewhat. Right in the middle of a tune the volume will noticeably drop then pick back up a few seconds later. Doesn't happen on every tune, but it occurs on more than one. Otherwise,an excellent document of the 1985 tour with Clive Gregson and Christine Collister supplying supporting vocals. I had the extreme pleasure of seeing RT and this lineup in Pittsburgh at the Graffiti Lounge in 1985. 'Twas my first time seeing RTand I was very impressed with the band, the tunes, and his guitar mastery."
4,Duplicate release with a new cover,I already own this CD but didn't recognize the new cover. It's worth 5 stars if you don't already own it but it's not worth 5 when you already have it. So now I have two - worse things have happened.
2,"Life's too short for ""solid"" performances","Having heard good things about this interpretation, and normally liking Ormandy a lot, I was terribly disappointed in his 1964 Petrushka. The music very seldom ""dances"". The whole affair seems leaden (and, if you're up for that sort of Petrushka, you'd be better off with Klemperer's weighty but interesting account on Testament). ""Bloated"" is what I'd say about this one -- the Philadelphia virtuosos can't rescue it from Ormandy. One feels Ormandy probably only liked The Firebird of Stravinsky's compositions. The ugly spot-miking of the Columbia engineers doesn't help; it's terribly obtrusive. Good luck, too, with Szell's Firebird and Daphnis; I thought they were heartless."
5,Wish I had This Book 40 years ago,I found this book to be a wonderful help. I wish I had this book 40 years ago when I was having a rough time in school. This book is GREAT for a refresher and actually for learning if you have never had a good math foundation.
5,Well organized,This little item really helps with cleaning up my desk. I can set my planner on it and write in it any time I need to add something to my schedule. It has really helped me out with keeping organized and viewing my planner. I'm planning on getting another one for at home.
3,Lots of mistakes but good book,"Good book available through publisher, I should know, i am the author's grandson."
4,Champlin is the best,"For us Australians who up until February 2004 had been deprived of seeing Chicago live for 25 years this dvd is a ripper.Not as good sound wise as the Soundstage concert but hey it does have 'Old Days on it and that has to be a plus.Oh and by the way Bill Champlin is just a breath of fresh air every song he sings he adds a new nuance too. I defy anyone to say his versions of ""Make Me Smile' and Free' are inferior to what has gone before.How about listening without prejudice for a change people.I also love the way all the guys seem to be having a great time and after what 37 odd years still give the fans what they want.Buy this and the 'Soundstage concert'DVD and as 'Letterman' would say 'That's all you need right there'"
3,a rational Chicago fan,"The musicianship is fantastic. Robert Lamm still sounds great, but the lack of Peter Cetera and Terry Kath drag these songs down. It's nobody's fault that it is what it is (Terry Kath has been dead for 26 years and Cetera seems to be happy with his solo music). One of the main reasons why this band sounded the way they did was the sound of Lamm, Kath, and Cetera's alternating lead vocals, with 2/3 of that missing, they sound like a really great cover band. When they've done newer stuff like the Christmas album it's great because they don't have to compete with their past. The ghost of the original Chicago lineup is too much for even them to live up to."
5,Make Me Smile,"Someone downgraded this performance in another review. Having watched this band from the start, meeting them and having other videos they did, this is a darn good performance. I am a drummer of 45 yrs so I am well qualified to say this concert on A&E is as good as anything else they have done. I totally disagree with the person who gave them a bad review. Buy it if you like the group!"
3,"Not bad, but Chicago can do better. Will fill the void ...","Chicago is a band that desperately needs a good performance mixed in 5.1 sound by a professional sound engineer. With 3 horns, 3 lead vocals and a million things going on at once, this is a band that would benefit heavily from the new sound medium.The problem is that neither this DVD nor the previous (horrific) RAW DVD capture and properly mix Chicago in 5.1 sound. RAW was so horrible that the instruments over-powered the vocals. This DVD is marginally better - but still sounds like it was recorded in a tin can. Hardly befitting of a group with Chicago's talents.I didn't find this to be the band's strongest performance either, but the casual Chicago fan who hasn't listened to a lot of Chicago performances will probably think it's terrific.That said, it did fill my fix for a Chicago DVD, even if I am a bit underwhelmed."
3,Chicago:Live By Request,"I love Chicago and was very pleased with the song selection on this DVD but was very surprised that more people didn't complain about the voice track which was mixed considerably lower than the instruments (which were done well). I even bought a second copy thinking I might just had gotten a bad copy but the 2nd copy played the same as the first with a poorly mixed voice track. I have a Sony Dream System which plays all other music DVDs just fine(I have nearly a hundred). If anyone owns this DVD and experienced this problem, please come forward and add your review."
2,Chicago live by request,"on 5.1 surround it sounds like your listening in a cave or tin can. Real disapointed in sound quality. Hard to hear vocals. Save your money and wait for the soundstage recording and hope it,s better"
3,Entertaining,"A great Chicago TV request show. The band and the music is great. I would give this 5 stars if it were a straight through concert without the in between requests etc. The visual is great , although I found the audio mix not at its very best probably due to the TV studio set up, and Peter Cetera is most definitely missed."
4,great songs - pity about 5.1,"The songs and format are great and the musicianship is awesome. Unlike many older groups the vocals are close to the original - in fact Peter Cetera is hardly missed. The only problem is the 5.1 sound - who ever mixed it has no idea what he was doing - it sounds as if the vocals are recorded in a toilet , while the band is in your lounge. Do the producers / engineers even listen to the sound , or just dont care ? In stereo or dolby pro-logic sound is great , but if you are into 5.1 , give it a miss. I personally love this dvd for the songs / memories and the sheer quality of the groups playing."
4,"GOOD SHOW, BUT MORE OPTIONS NEEDED","THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS DVD IS THAT YOU CANT WATCH THE SHOW WITHOUT THE BETWEEN SONG TALKING FROM THE ORIGINAL A&E BROADCAST. IT'S FUN TO SEE ONCE, BUT AFTER THAT, I JUST WANT TO HEAR THE SONGS. THERE SHOULD BE THE OPTION TO JUST PLAY THE CONCERT. I HAVE OTHER DVD'S WITH THIS FEATURE. I ALSO DONT UNDERSTAND THE OTHER REVEIWERS PROBLEM WITH THE SOUND. IT SOUNDS GREAT ON MY SYSTEM. DID YOU TRY ALL THE AUDIO OPTIONS? ALL IN ALL, IT'S A GOOD SHOW."
3,"Awsome Band, Great Show, Great Performance...Bad DVD","I'll keep this short and sweet...Chicago has written (in my book, anyway) some of the greatest songs of all time. They are an incredible band made up of outstanding musicians, songwriters and vocalists. A&E has a great thing going with it's ""Live By Request"" shows, and the Chicago performance on the program was good - but this DVD is just not up to par. As an audio engineer, I know that things go wrong during a live performance. I also know that, if recorded correctly, there is no excuse for the audio on this DVD to sound as bad as it does. I own the DVD, I like the DVD...it's still a great band performing a great set. I am extremely disappointed with the quality of the audio program."
5,The band so great a city was named for them....,"This is a GREAT preformance from AMERICA'S GREATEST BAND! What I like best about this DVD is the interaction between the host, the callers, and the band members, and all the wonderful stories and comments the band members have to share with us.The songs are great...the only musical complaint I have is that the whole Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon is not on here...but you can't have everything....Mr. Walt Parazaider's solos are quite musical and beautiful, might I add..."
5,Really worth the $$,"Wow, that last reviewer thought this was awful? It's absolutely a great DVD. If you're a fan of Chicago, you'll love it. If you're not, I can't see how you won't become one. They play the you-know-what out of this stuff. By far the best Chicago DVD out."
5,Good Carrier - Slightly Off Measurements,"I bought this for my cat and was pleased at the ease of getting her in and out. You can put your pet in through the top or the front.Solid materials and quality construction make it surprisingly easy to transport your pet (an insert in the bottom turns the carrier rigid for transport).Only drawback - the description is off. The dimensions are 18"" L x 10.5 H and it only supports 20lbs."
4,Pretty heavy stuff,"I assume they are named after a Melvins song, and the tribute is apt. Played at any volume, you can appreciate that when these songs were recorded, the volume was cranked at 11 throughout. Some is slow, some is fairly fast, none of it at a speed-metal pace. Actually reminds me of the best Black Flag, the way their clear enthusiasm for volume and ugly noise competes with simple, good song structure. I would imagine they're quite a good live show."
2,Brahms for the faint-hearted,"Brahms 2nd is one of my favourite classical pieces, a symphony which pulls it's listener in every direction, from the nostalgia driven first and second movements to the exciting and uplifting finale. This however is my opinion - and clearly not the opinion of George Szell. Szell sacrifices any passion and intensity for a purely clinical and cold approach. Sure the playing is first rate with great precision - and provides some nice moments - but stick this in you hi-fi, go and read a book or some amazon reviews, and you will forget it's on. Sorry but I happen to like the 'thick textured' whole-hearted approach of Solti."
3,Symponic dissapointment,"Generally speaking Szell tends to convice through his ear for balance rather then seeking warmth...the Cleveland orchestra for the most part are given a recording that is dry and dessicated. Woodwind solos are generally good but with little or not inflection and nuance. I was very dissapointed with the slow movement of Symphony no. 2...it was rather plodding and too straighforward. William Steinberg in Pittsburgh was much more involving and committed.I have found too many people quick to find the right set of Brahms records...Sanderling is my first choice in terms of warmth of phasing and passion. Although his tempos are a bit slower...he doesn't allow the Dresden Statskappelle to gloss over the Brahms symphonies like Cleveland does here....Don't get me wrong, I think Szell is good, but as I get older I realize the well-oiled Cleveland machine under Szell is a bit like kissing the chrome plating on the bumper of a Cadillac!!!"
3,"Nice pictures, good info.","It looks good, has great pictures, but the serious soapmaker will find their money better spent elsewhere.Milling (or rebatching) soaps is a tricky process and even following these instructions exactly will not ensure good soap.If you're curious about this book, check it out a t the library first"
2,Vegans Beware!,"Con: There are only 2 recipes that feature strictly non-animal based products. In-depth instructions on 'rendering' While you *can* change the oils, the lye calculations must be reformulated to compensate for the differing SAP levels. That, combined with the fact that the recipes are a bit lye heavy is, in my opinion, too much hassle.Pro: The rebatch section has beautiful (triple lemon) and unusual (lettuce!) soap.Pro: Very nice photos. Excellent wrapping/presentation ideas.Recommendation: consider the library before making purchase.Recommendation: ""The Soapmaker's Companion"" by Cavitch is more suited for (and leans toward) vegetarian/vegan soapmakers."
1,Too intimidating for the the soap newbie,"I found this book very intimidating, it was the first info I had bought and read about soap making,and the whole way it is written seemed to make soap making a scary prospect especially if you are afraid of lye, then add on top of that the rendering your own fat section! Ahhhhhhh------------! I bought it a year ago, read it put it on the shelf and said "" I guess soap making is too hard, it's not for me! Now that I have access to the internet I have found other info about soapmaking and am finally ready to try it! Whew! It now doesn't seem so scary when I read other's directions and techniqes!I don't feel this is a good book for the soapmaking illiterate! Not for beginners!"
3,The Complete Soapmaker,"Being completely new to soapmaking I used this book as my reference tool and have been pouring water into lye, as instructed, which I now understand (many batches later) is a huge mistake! I don't understand why this book has not been recalled if this is the case. With that said, I love the pictures, I love the recipes. However, I find the stove top method of rebatching with water to be a completely frustrating and messy experience. Now that I have several batches of soap under my belt, I will not handmill soap again. I find it to NOT be worth the effort involved. As far as the soapmaking kit itself; I threw away the glycerin soap base as I simply could not stomach the smell!!! It gave me a headache and upset my stomach. There was also a written contradiction as to whether it was essential oil or fragrance oil included (I believe it was fragrance oil)."
1,Misleading and poor value,"Superficially this looks like a good book, however the appearance is misleading. The recipes do not produce good soap and the instructions for re-batching produce rather unpleasant-textured soap that takes months to harden up and become useable. The author recommends the use of fabric dyes, many of which are highly toxic and should never be applied to the skin. Slightly less serious, she recommends using pot-pourri fragrance oils which are not approved for cosmetic use and can cause major problems in the soap manufacture. There are far better books on soapmaking around, don't waste your time and money on this one."
2,"pretty pictures provide inspiration, but little substance","This is a very pretty soapmaking book, and one that is good for inspiration, but little else. That is not a fatal drawback; I have many books the sole purpose of which is to provide inspiration. However, the book is seriously lacking basic information (such as lye-fat tables, sources, or a real trouble-shooting guide), and I find the rebatching recipes call for too much water. (In addition, her lye handling instructions are contrary to good safety practice.) All in all, this would be best bought with another book, such as The Soapmaker's Companion, which gives much more solid information, but lacks the slick, glossy photos."
3,Great Pictures! Rebatching techniques...?,"I have rebatched using her methods a few times and ended up with some truly ugly soap. I don't know, maybe I'm doing something wrong, but other soapers I have talked to say her method uses too much water. Other than that, this book is to drool over!!!!!"
2,Nice pictures but!!,"Being my first soapmaking book, it was very impressive to see the beautiful pictures it contained. I tried the vegetarian basic soap recipe in order to mill it and make the fabulous soaps displayed. The milled soap never melted. It was like a waxy consistence but I placed it in the molds anyway fighting the air bubbles. I told myself"" maybe if I try the Castille soap basic recipe it would melt(and olive oil is expensive) well it did not melt either and what a shoulder,arm and back workout it was to mix the paste. We need more trouble shooting included in the book I'm sure we can get those nice looking soaps some day!!"
2,Great photos. Bad instructions!,"Ihonestly don't understand this book, though I am grateful since the excellent pictures inspired me to continue the quest. I tried to mill as a beginner and then again as an experienced soapmaker. Both times I got the samething, warped and shrunken bars, though I did use the same basic recipe.I've heard you need to start with a good base and her base did not work. I'd love to try again, but only if someone else has had success. Have you? email me. Wendy"
1,DANGEROUS INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!,I used a library copy to make my very first batch of soap. This book should be RECALLED!! It states to add water to the lye AND I DID! VERY DANGEROUS! I thank GOD it did not explode in my face!! Now I know that you should ALWAYS ADD LYE TO THE WATER!!! Still thanking God I didnt get burned!! Please read the other comments warning about this book. Really a soap makers nightmare!
3,"Great for the hand-milling recipes, but . . .",". . . a little off-the-mark when it comes to basic soap. I made the Basic White Soap and, when I unmolded the primary mold, the soap was so brittle, it couldn't even be cut.When it came time to grate and hand-mill, however, the soap turned out decently. I have used Sandy Maine's excellent book, but had to decrease the batch substantially, and I wanted a gentler soap, anyway. I think I will try Susan Cavitch's book next (saw it in the bookstore, but never got it. I will hark back to Coney's book when it comes time to handmill, though. I can't wait to try those recipes!"
1,"Deceptive title, minimum value","I've been making soap for years and this is the least helpful of all the many soap making books I own. It bills itself as the ""Complete Soapmaker"" however it is not this at all. The entire focus of the book is on rebatching. As most any experienced soapmaker will tell you, rebatching is time consuming, unpredictable, and often unnecessary. If someone wants to learn rebatching then this is an OK resource (although I think the pictures and recipes do not emphasize the challenges of rebatching). However, as a ""complete"" resource on soapmaking...I don't think this book fits the bill."
3,A mixed bag,"There is a serious and potentially extremely dangerous mistake in this book. Ms Coney instructs the soapmaker to add water to the lye crystals and makes a particular point of empohasising this, however this is counter to all laboratory safety procuedures and is actively dangerous.Having said that, there are some excellent ideas and the book is beautifully presented and produced. The instructions call for rather too much water in the rebatching process but the basic recipes seem to be good."
1,You've got to be KIDDDING me!,"Wow! What a terrible book! Who is comfortable handling lye (which the author admits can ruin metal, wood, clothes, etc., and she advises you to wear goggles and rubber gloves to handle); can find obscure ingredients like finely ground pumice, sweet almond oil, powdered kelp, frankincense powder and vitamin E oil at their local supermarket; wants to give up an enamel or stainless steel cooking pot and two plastic pitchers forever (you can't use it for anything else after you put lye in it); and has two spare candy thermometers handy? Not I. I will find another soap book. Thank goodness I borrowed this one from the library first. Sheesh."
1,Doesn't work,"This book has beautiful photos and cover, but that is about it. I bought it years ago, when I first started making soap. What I wanted was something about hand milling soaps, this book is about rebatching. I did not try her basic soap recipe, but I did try her rebatching techniques. None of them worked, it took the grated soap forever to melt and forever to harden. Finally I gave up, and the book has sat on the shelf unused for years. There is much better information to be found on the internet."
4,"Good condition, good book",I recived the Soapmaker book in good state and I am satisfied with provided informations about the book itself. It has a lot of recipies for handmilled soaps and that is what I was looking for. I am a little dissapointed that all the recepies are simple but ts a good begginers book.
1,Inaccurate and misleading ESPECIALLY dangerous for beginners,"One of many soapmaking books I purchased when beginning soapmaking. Thankfully, it isn't the first one I actually used. She warns on page 34-- ""don't make the mistake of adding the lye to the water"" when the correct method is EXACTLY the opposite --or a SERIOUS explosion/reaction can happen. The recipes are also very ""lye heavy"" and she confuses ""handmilling"" with what soapmakers term ""rebatching"". I'm very concerned that this book comes highly recommended on many web sites for beginners to soapmaking. There are many better books out there that are much more informative AND accurate!! Hot and cold process soapmaking isn't teribly difficult and very rewarding, but when working with caustic chemicals, one should be well-informed. This book could seriously mislead someone."
1,BS,It's a filter for a camera as old as the stone age but it doesn't say that anywhere on the product description. You realize it until you get the damn thing.
3,Good but out of subject,"With this book,I expect to have a complete coverage of the games between Army & Navy in the last hundred years.In place I have the complete story of both colleges with some highlights of Army-Navy games.The book is divise in two part,one chapter on Army story the next on Navy story.You have one chapter about Army-Navy games and the two or three next chapters talk about games against Notre Dame or Boston college or the problems with players discipline at West Point,etc.That a very good book,I recomend it to everyone who want to learn about Army or Navy story but if like me you want a complete coverage of Army-Navy games tradition it's better for you to look somewhere else.I don't give only three stars cause the book is bad,that a very good book but they pass too much time to talk about things that have nothing to see with Army-Navy games."
5,Should be required reading for every athelete.,"Maybe if the pampered pros were to read this book and find out what REAL players go through for the love of the game (and not the next endorsement deal,) there would be fewer stories about them driving drunk, snorting coke, or hitting their wives/girlfriends. Anyone who loves sports or the military should read this book. For those of us who love both, it's even better. Kudos to Mr. Feinstein and the boys at Army and Navy. Our country is in good hands."
5,A link to the past,"Well, I am a cadet, and a starter on the football team. I first read the book when I was at the prep school a few years ago. This is an excellent book for more than just good writing. It is a good book because it is a great link to the past I met JD otherwise know as Joel Davis at the prep school. He is huge. I talk to Ed Stover every now and then as well. My roomate, also a ball player came here because of his relationship with Ron Leshinski. I have met one of the other players wives interviewed in the book. The 1995 season is so pivitol to me because it is a large part of the reason that I came to the point. I saw the Notre Dame game when I was on JV for my HS and all I could think was how great it would be to play for a school like that. Seeing the cadets rushing out of the stands to do pushups on every score and the foot from glory Leshinski suffered is forever etched in my mind. This book puts me in their shoes for a while. It is a must read."
5,More than just a sports story,"John Feinstein is, with the possible exception of George Plimpton, the most pompous sportwriter in America. Having said that, he has written the best sports book of the late 1990s. ""A Civil War,"" is about much more than just the Army-Navy game. It is about life in the service academies and how a special group of recruits truly do play just for the love of the game. Feinstein lucked out a chose a (very) rare season in which both Army and Navy made it to bowl games. The Army-Navy game itself that year was also a heartbreaker. There are so many good individual stories among the players that you will swear he made some of them up. This is sportswriting at its absolute best."
5,Must Buy,Best book I have read in a long time. Great tradition. Very well written. I applaud Feinstein. He put a lot of time and work into this book and it payed off.
2,"Lots of stories, little useful advice","Book was disappointing. Lots of stories but didn't offer any concrete advice on how to deal with controlling people other than saying ""what"" to them."
3,"Too simplistic for me, but may be helpful for others...","This may benefit someone who is first acknowledging that they need help with a difficult person, hopefully with the assistance of a competent counselor. People who have a tough time initially recognizing manipulators will probably appreciate Patricia Evan's congenial writing style.If one is more interested in an analytical analysis about what motivates controllers, or how to defuse the complex verbal tactics of advanced controllers, this isn't the source. I agree with another reviewer who thought the ""what?"" or ""nonsense!"" tactic could potentially backfire, especially when used by a novice. However, the genuinely nice people out there who have a tough time sticking up for themselves for whatever reason may find this a supportive introduction."
3,Women can be controlling too,"I would have given this book 5 stars, except that it almost seems to be a male-bashing book. I am sure that the majority of controllers are male and there aren't enough examples to be found where the controller is female. Also, most men would never read this book because it's not ""manly"" to read these kinds of books. I understand the business end of this book. That is, most controllers are men and ""macho"" men don't read books like this, so to sell the book, let's write it to sell to the female side"
1,Not for me,"I borrowed this book for free from the Kindle owner's lending library. I come from a family where I have been put down by both of my parents on a constant basis. Believing that there is something wrong with me is the story of my life.I want to break free of their put downs and reassure myself that the problem isn't me. I thought this book was going to provide me with something to run with, but I got nothing.I failed to connect with this book. I got tired of the dialogue, the ""for examples"", the many pages of what people have told her, and craved to read something that applied to me. Something that I could do or say or just anything really. Nothing clicked for me.I don't recommend this book, there has to be another read available that provides direction and helpful suggestions."
3,Controlling People,"The book was purchased new, so the condition was excellent, of course. The content is interesting, but the author indulges in almost laughable hyberpole. She discusses well known psychological concepts, either dismissing them or disguising them with her own terminology. If you can get past her claims to change your life and save the world, you may find some useful information."
4,"Catch this lifeline before the ship sinks, with you still aboard!","After 8 months of a roller coaster relationship and one month in therapy, this book gave me back my sanity. Ms Evans exposes the mysteries about controlling people and the secrets that they struggle to hide, at your expense.I now understand that it was not me, and there is not much to be done about it. Read this book before you drive yourself crazy trying to understand, or be understood. She delves into the core of the disconnected individual, frankly and with great insight.Controlling people exsist, they can ruin your life and they are oblivious. Save yourself with this read, before you are tempted to ""help"" that controlling person that is creating havoc with your life."
1,"Great topic, very poor book","I was quite excited when I read about this book, and quickly read it when it was delivered. What a disappointment! The author takes what could have been easily condensed into a magazine article into 300 page book, teasing out some general advice into a mishmash of poorly written tripe.Want to save money? Here's the secret for ""breaking the spell"" of the controlling person in your life: when they say something controlling, such as thinking they know better than you what you are thinking or feeling, say ""What?"" or ""Nonsense."" That's it, and it took 250 pages to get to this ""gem"", and sixteen pages to explain it.I had definitely hoped for more useful information both on how to improve myself so that I am less ""controllable"" and how to effectively deal with people who seek to control me. Perhaps that book has yet to be written."
3,repetitive and simplistic,"disappointing - not a very helpful book for some circumstances, clunky writing style - very repetitive"
5,"Not knowing ""WHY"" is driving you NUTS: Read THIS!","Reading this book took a thousand pounds of pain off my heart and soul. It finally told me WHY I was abused, by people who claimed to ""love"" me. It did what no therapist had been able to do, and took away grief that no anti-depressant could touch. It gave me back my sanity, my energy, my belief in myself and in life. If someone is constantly critical of you, cold to you for no reason, ordering you around and calling you ugly names... and, all you do is try to get along with them and try to figure out why you can't ""reach"" them.. READ THIS.Then, send an email to everyone you know, telling them to pass along the information about this book to everyone in their address book, without regard to whether it seems to be needed... just keep passing it along. You will never know how many other people are suffering in silence.....Just pass along the information, as your good deed for the world,and let those who need it, find it. You will literally save lives."
3,"Very Academic, but good information","I liked this book, however, if it's the first that you read on the subject of Controlling personalities, I think that it would be too academic and dry. It does provide a broad perspective on the issue, and do feel it was worthwhile, I just realize that if you are looking for practical information on this that you can use to understand a relationship you are in you might want to read something that isn't so dry."
4,"Controlling People: How to Recognize, Understand, and Deal with People Who Try To Control You","Once I started reading this book, I could not stop it was so dead on when it came to the description of Controlling People it made me shake, it reminded me of my husband (who has since moved out). I was not aware of controlling people until my encounter. But this book is just amazing in assisting you to understand what is on the controlling persons mind and why they do what they do. I would highly recommend this book."
4,"An Important Book, Poorly Written","Ms Evans has made a ground-breaking stand in helping people identify a controlling relationship. The behaviours of ""controlling people"" are made clear and unmistakeable, which will definitely be a comfort to people who may have felt that they could not put their finger on precisely what is wrong in their relationship with a controller. As has been previously noted, the rather fluffy terms Evans uses throughout the work (Teddy, Spellbreakers, etc.) do tend to grate after a while, and Evans does not go on to give much advice on how to cope with a controller once s/he is identified. If the author is leading up to something, I'd love to see it. As it stands, it's spot-on for identifying the problem, but lacking in how to solve it."
3,Define the concepts,"I like Patrica Evans's book and am on my third reading but she really does not define her concepts well enough and I find it difficult to know what on earth she means by this ""Teddy"" idea and the ""Witness"" idea.The Bubble analogy is useful as one can begin to see controlling people inside the bubble. In fact, a psychic took it to put oneself inside a bubble for protection. Nevertheless I would ask her to make a glossary and define her concepts. Does she mean Teddy bears and people like religious witnesses? Or are they like legal witnesses?"
3,"Painful to read, but enlightening","This book has a different perspective on controlling people, and it helps the person who is controlling to understand what they do and why they do it. It also gives suggestions on how to respond for those being controlled by others. I ran out of steam a bit after about 2/3rds of the way through the book."
5,Get This Book!,"Fantastic book! A complete explanation of the inexplicable. Why some people behave in such strange ways, particularly in close relationships. ""The Verbally Abusive Relationship"" and ""Verbal Abuse Survivors Speak Out"" explained what verbal abuse was and how to (and more importantly, how not to) respond to it. This book goes a step further and outlines the psychology of the verbally abusive person.So now, you not only know what to do about it, you can understand why they are like they are. If you've ever experienced a verbally abusive relationship (and probably most of have, at some time), then you need this information. Get it now!"
3,Good Theories,"The author has good theories to explain why other people may try to control others. I wish her standard response to such people was not: ""What?"" For example, when she described a stranger coming up to her and commanding her to smile, she kept repeating: ""What?"" and the stranger responded by telling her to smile again and again. A better response to the smile command (to nip it in the bud) might have been to get up and move away without saying a word. Or just ignore the person if you can't get away immediately. To repeat ""What?"" over and over again only encourages the person making the controlling statement, in my opinion, to keep making that statement."
4,Exposition Repeat Omitted but otherwise splendid,"This Mahler 6th presents something of a quandry for CD buyers and Mahlerites. Szell, like Leinsdorf before him, omits the extremely important first movement exposition repeat. I am not a purist when it comes to repeats. In my humble opinion, some work, others make no sense. This one works because the development is very long and without the repeat, the movement seems to be out of balance. However, if you can tolerate the repeat omission, the performance is a great one with some of the finest orchestral playing you will ever hear, especially in the finale."
3,Szell ignores composer's intentions,"For all of the acclaim this recording receives, people are ignoring the typical Szell trademark that is found in even his Beethoven recordings: the decision that the composer didn't really ""mean it"" when he marked an exposition repeat in a sonata-form movement. With Szell, who even ignores Beethoven's repeats, surely we couldn't expect him to take the huge repeat in the first movement of this symphony. But in omiting it, Szell tells us at once that he has no understanding of the symphony at all. When Mahler, of all people, indicates an exposition repeat, you had better darn well take it! The repeat is necessary to balance the first movement against the huge finale, and Mahler is making a statement about the ""classical"" structure of the symphony by including the repeat. By no means should this ever be your only Sixth because you are missing out on a lot of the meaning of the symphony if you don't have that repeat."
5,a fabulous bargain,"Even if you already own one or more complete sets of the Mahler symphonies, I would still recommend adding this CD to your collection. I would rank it alongside Michael Gielen's live recording of the 8th as among the best budget priced performances of one symphony in the entire catalogue. This effort has all the fine qualities that marked Szell's best work in Cleveland, with immaculate and precise playing, and dramatic but unexaggerated conducting. The tempo is convincing and the playing has great rhythmic control, particularly in the 2nd movement. The CD has well balanced sound and adequate range. The entire work has been fitted onto one CD without compromising the interpretation, or the sound quality, in any way. This performance is equal in quality to his fine 4th Symphony. Strongest recommendation."
2,good idea-doesnt work,"derive your pleasure from this by looking at it, because if you try to use it you will be vastly dissapointed. the doughnuts dont fall in homers mouth, you have to turn a little crank and it slips out of gear all the time, very sad-but the toy itself looks pretty cool."
2,A One Time Read,"Overall not a bad book, but nothing that I feel compelled to keep for rereading at a later date. I do believe very strongly though that a bit more research should have gone into this book. A line from the book goes:""But Nature's healing processes had eased her sadness and the two reddish-brown eggs beneath her gave her a joy to match her sorrow"" Robin's eggs are a light blue. Sounds petty I know but . . . I do believe you should atleast know the basic backround of the creature you are making the hero."
1,"One: sorrowful, two: joyless...","This book is not worth half the media-hype it was given. The writing should have befited such an interesting premise, but, sadly it did not. The vocabulary is poor, the characters (albeit furry and bird-like) are miserably one-dimensional, and the plot unveils in a way that, should the reader be naive enough to continue to the second part, he'll have no hesitation to simply move on to a second, better book. This book, as you can see from most other reviews, is not worth the read."
2,Now what I expected,I expected this video to have more music on it! I think I should have researched it better! You do get the message that Kenny loved football as a kid and has a great respect for the game as an adult!
5,Boys of Fall,"As another Kenny Chesney song goes ""I go back"". If you have ever played a sport or been a member of a team you must see this! This video should be required for every kid to see before he goes out for football."
5,birthday gift,got this for my brother's 60th b-day. he played from CYO to college. and remains a die hard fan. said it is the BEST documentary he has ever seen. he couldn't have been more surprised or happy with this gift. delivery was within 2 days of purchase.
3,Error 41,"I can tell you what this mysterious ""error 41"" message is at least. The printheads put into this series of printers will cause this error if they fail - either by a hairline fracture on the head itself or if the voltage flickers from high to low causing a small short (or something - as per Brother themselves) I'm in the UK and deal with Brother every day - the service they have here is second to none and upon the Error 41 appearing they usually have an engineer out to replace the printhead within 48 hours, which resolves the problem 9 times out of 10. The constant cleaning cycle can again be remedied by a factory reset, and I find it such a shame that the support you get over there doesn't sound as good as it is over here. I still recommend Brother to most people, even with the problems on this series, which has been addressed and resolved in their latest range."
2,Not Durable,"I liked this printer at first because I was able to insert my CF card from my digital camera right into the front of the printer. It would then download all my pictures.Soon I found the ink clogs so easily that after about 5 pages printed the black ink was only half there. It was very light and smudged. I would have to get it to run a cleaning cycle. Sometimes it had to clean 3 times or so before the black would work. It also happened with the colors several times.The photo printing was so-so.Then I got an ""error 41."" This says to unplug the printer and call brother. Great. Its a generic catch all error I've found and it can mean your printer is now useless. This happened to me after only having the printer 5 or 6 months."
1,MFC-4420c (MalFunctioningCrap),"You know, today my wife and I were discussing how this scanner/fax was the worst piece of garbage we have ever purchased. Notice, I left off the word ""printer."" That is because it's spent more time performing the print-head cleaning than it has actually printing anything.But alas, it was done in by the very act it seemed to enjoy so much. After a few months where we only used it as an outgoing fax, I took it to my office. Once there, I performed the head-cleaning ritual 8-10 times before the printer would deign to lay down some ink. After the 12th head cleaning the MFC-4420c committed printercide; the message ""Machine error 41 - unplug and call Brother"" scrolls incessantly across it's LCD display.I believe the only remedy is to ship this rubbish back to Brother. Unfortunately, the 4420c is not worth the cost of shipping."
1,Another error 41,"I also bought a Brother MFC multi-function printer in this case MFC-3420C. Just 13 months after buying it it started getting Error 41. Brother said the warentee is only good for a year, and so we need to spend $200 to fix it. Same price as a new one. I will never buy a Brother multifunction printer again!!!!!"
1,Boycott all brother products,At about 18 months i got an ERROR 41. It means a $150 service call on a $200 printer. What a crock.
1,Coming soon to a dumpster near you.. Mal-Functioning Crap,"Like some of the other reviewers here, my MFC (Mal-Functioning Crapper) popped up with the ""Machine Error 41.. Unplug Unit then call Brother"" after just a few months of use. So I guess this is how it's going to work with Multi-Function printers, you pay $150 or so, and it lasts a year to 18 months, if you're lucky."
1,Junk,"This is the only and I stress, LAST Brother Printer I will ever own. It was causing me problems from Day 1. Sent back after a few months, took a couple months to get it back, got it back still wasnt working, sent it back again. Got it back after 3 months...... warranty has expired......total pages I've printed, about 30. 2 sets of ink cartriges gone through.... Brother service???? non-existant.....Customer satisfaction,???NONE.They should have recalled these printers and given everyone their money back, or replaced with a different printer...."
1,Piece of Crap,"I have had print head problems with this since day one. Brother support is horrible, ink cartridges dry out when still 90% full. Constant and repeated cleaning makes it worse. There are reams of complaints about this product. Do not buy it."
1,Kick it to the Curb,"I purchased this printer in July 2004. As others have mentioned, it continually goes into cleaning cycles but can't seem to keep itself unclogged. After less than 2 years of use, I had the dreaded ""error 41"" indicating a bad print head which Brother replaced under extended warranty. Less than 18 months later, same error but this time the cost of replacement came out of my own pocket. I was told that using off brand ink was a cause of failure. I stuck to the Brother brand of ink and just over 2 years after the second print head replacement, I'm getting ""error 41"" again. I will never buy another Brother product again."
1,"Looks great, prints badly","I have had this printer for a little more than 2 years now. Its a great looker as others have mentioned, and its low profile is perhaps the best in the all-in-one segment. It will fax well. The included software is OK. But it is a dog at printing. I've replaced the black cartridge numerous times, and I only print perhaps 15 pages a month! Sometimes, I replaced the cartridge twice in a month; and even then it has streaking issues.The real cost of ownership of this printer is unaffordably high. I'd say stay cvlear of it until a better one comes out of Brother's design team."
1,LOOK UP REVIEWS B4 you even think about buying this,"1. I had a lot of trouble putting this unit into use.2. ATE ATE ATE Ink.3. Cleaned itslef nearly constantly.4. Like numerous other users/Complainers got an ""ERROR 41"" Message after maybe 1000 sheets printed(or less)- I am a very very light user.5. Service center is 1.5 hours away.6. Complaints about this unit are all over the Internet.7. Beware.8. Something should be properly done like total reimbursement by Brother for the problems this unit has caused consumers.9. DO Not buy this unit until checking out the complaints."
4,Good read,Burke is a very good writer and it shows in this tale of the Texas battle for independence. Yada yada.
1,"There are no more ""new"" 625 Receivers.","For some reason my first review disappeared. This is factual information that can be verified with the manufacturer.I purchased a ""new"" 625 from a seller here on Amazon and they sent me a remanufactured unit instead. When I talked to Dish Network they told me that they have not made any new 625 receivers in over 2 years and that retailers know that they are ordering remanufactured units. Also, if a retailer still has new 625 receivers in their inventory they will not work as the internal smartcards are the previous generation and expired. The rep at Dish Network did not speak well of retailers selling this model as ""new"".There are no more ""new"" 625 receivers, so don't waste your time or money trying to get a new one as they will send you either a defective unit or a reman. If you want a working 625 you will need to purchase a reman."
5,"Excellent DVR, much better than TIVO","Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Feature loaded! The dual tuner works great. Now, I can be watching one show in the basment, while my wife watches another upstairs, both using all of the DVR functions from the same receiver. Plus, countless times I have recorded two shows at once while watching another on DVR --- which used to be unheard of with Satellite TV."
2,Not good customer service,"Service rep simply rude, was not helpful at all. I do not recomend this company. Dish network is not so great either."
2,Does expect it to last,"I have been a Dish subscriber for over 4 years. After about 2 years, the hard drive on the new 625 model died. It started making awful sounding noises. Dish replaced the receiver, but all recorded programs were lost.Dish replaced receiver with a refurbished model. After two years, now the receiver will play back recordings that are pixelated and the picture/sound with start and stop. At least I could watch some live tv. Then a day later the receiver rapidly died. It would constantly cycle on and off trying to find a satellite. It will let you watch 1 minute of tv then cycle on/off."
1,What to do with an old DVR 625 without a dish network subscription,"Without a Dish Network subscription there are still a few things you can do with an old DVR 625. I found that you can watch the videos stored on the DVR without a service card. It cannot be used to record, watch TV inputs or USB memory stick. You can take the 235 G hard drive out and copy all the recorded shows to your own PC. Just remove the hard drive from the DVR and connect it to a desktop computer. The Dish Network uses a Linux hard disk format called Ext. (Dish Network uses Linux to run its unit if that helps.) You will have to Mount the three unnamed partitions to see them with Windows. Just use the Windows disk manager to see the DVR hard disk. A special program like Ext2fsd can be used to label the partitions. As far as I know the rest of the DVR 625 unit is useless without a subscription. I just kept the 235 gig HD in my desktop computer and trashed the rest of the DVR 625 unit."
4,Classic cowboy poet but dated,"Fletcher is one of the original cowboy poets and his verse is recited and especially sung all over the world. He was an old rodeo cowboy with a ton of talent who turned Hollywood cowboy. Probably his best known poem is Strawberry Roan which has become a folk song that is often not even credited to Fletcher.This collection does not include Fletcher's obscene verse which is also known and recited worldwide. Fletcher's wicked sense of humor is less evident in this collection.Some of his verse is dated and stilted but it still has the flavor of horses and sagebrush running deeply through it.Overall, give this book a shot if you like cowboy poetry and you'll be glad you did."
5,This book is ideal for teaching TI DSP!,"For the classroom, this is an ideal way to teach the TMS320C6000 DSP platform. With its lab examples and common DSP operations, it is a great resource."
5,quick cheap functional,The service was quickThe product was well pricedThe product is fully functional
4,printer cable,"Printer cable was sold separately from the hp3180 all in one printer/scanner/copier. The printer works fine with this cable. My only minor gripe is that the shipping charge cost more than the actual cable which was shipped separately, but needed it and it's so much easier to shop all at once, purchase the right item, without the hassle of driving to go get it and then not being certain if you purchased the proper fitting item."
5,Great quality for a good price,I have been using it for several months and it works great. No difference from the $30 cable bought in big stores out there.
5,It works!,I bought this when I ordered the HP C3180 All in One from Amazon in October. My grand total with shipping was only $80. You don't need to spend a lot of money on a USB cable. This one does the job.
1,Interesting Situation,"They sent me a 2-inch USB for an iPod instead of the 6-ft cord I needed for my printer (to connect it to the computer.) Then they asked me to delete my bad review of their company and the situation (They wanted to refund my money, minus shipping costs) and then they would refund the cost of the item. Granted, I paid more in shipping and confirmation than I did the first time around. I will not buy from them again."
5,Exactly what I needed and awesome price!,"I got a new desk and the distance from tower and printer location doubled. The 6ft cord just reaches and works perfectly. I print color and black and white pages with no delay and no issues. The price was soo awesome that I worried about function, but don't worry. This is a great product at a great price.It was shipped to me quickly too."
5,Works perfectly,Works perfectly as promised (and was very cheap). Great for printers and any other products that need the square USB connector.
4,I'm satisfied.,I bought this cable to connect my printer to my computer. Does the job & price was reasonable.
5,Excellent product - use it for USB printing,"This is the second time I purchased a cable from an Amazon affiliate for 1 / 10th of the price you find in stores. It works perfectly transferring information from my Mac to a Canon printer. I'm not sure why it costs so much less than at the store, but I appreciate it!"
5,Startech 6ft Premium USB 2.0 Hihg Speen Device Cable,The stores wanted $25 for a brand new shorter version of the cable! Product works perfectly and is longer than others. Received product within 5 days! I would reccommend this product ot anyone!
1,Shipping and Product Problems,"Ordered a 6 ft. USB A-B cable on August 1st. The estimated delivery date was 8/7- 8/12. I was on vacation until the 15th and still didnt receive it by that time. It finally came the following Monday on the 18th. The deal-breaker however was the fact that I paid more in shipping than for the product itself and they weren't able to deliver on-time. Also, the brand listed on Amazon was Startech, this cable was some generic flimsy made from China bs."
4,Amusingly Relaxing,"Listened to this CD many times. The words are good, the beat is great and it is totally relaxing. It puts you a in good mood and frame of mind. It is was even more enjoyable, especially after a few rum punches"
3,A very good book,"I like poems very much! In this book there were quite a lot. The story is exciting, romantic and sometimes also funny. Of course I also see the tragic side of the novel. It shows a good way to live on's life: Carpe Diem!"
2,Disappointing Book to a great Movie,"Yes, I admit, I loved the movie and it's definitely one of the two best movies in the world. And that's the reason I can't tell you how disappointed I was about this book. The author seemed to have watched the movie and while he did that, he wrote just down what he saw. Hardly any emotions, feelings or thoughts of the characters are mentioned, and I think that's what a book is about, that's what makes it something other than just a long review of the movie. Sure, the story and the message are still great - and that's the only thing that makes give it two stars instead of one. My advice: Watch the movie another time instead of reading this plain book."
4,Daed poets society ---- by Carsten & Michael ----10b,"This book really impressed me. It shows in a wonderful way, how young people can be influenced in a positive way and have a big developement. The main figure Mr. Keating is a teacher which every pupil wants to have. I think he is a real hero of the book!Nice greatings to our english-teacher Mrs. Stiefermann!Michael & Carsten"
4,Good read,"I found it a good book. It is not very difficult to read. In fact it is rather quite easy to understand. It is na interesting book and good entertainment.The story shows that we should do what we want and that we shouldn't listen to other people. People should hear what their hearts tell them and fight for that. Make your dream come true! But the book shows us, too that there are people who haven't the character to fight for their dreams..."
4,A very emotional novel,"It's a very emotional novel, which makes you think about a lot of things. There are many different characters and in one of those you can perhaps see yourself. The message of it is, that you have to be an individual and that you have to do what you want. It shows you how life is like with all the injuries and despair. It's very well written so you can easily understand this message."
5,"""Dead Poets Society"" -> a great movie!!!","We watched the movie ""Dead Poets Society"" in school. The language used is simple and not too heavy. ""Dead Poets Society"" is an interesting movie because you can associate the boys with the pupils nowadays. The characters of the members from ""Dead Poets Society"" are great because they are very different. The movie is exciting from the beginning to the end. Robin Williams is the main actor and he does his work good. ""Dead Poets Society"" is lovely, interesting and exciting but on the other hand it is very dramatic. The message and the story are still great and makes you feel inspired for your future, you will enjoy life more. The story shows how you can make your life extraordinary and that it is good to seize the day."
5,Shakespeare mixed with E.A.Poe and Spielberg,"This is one of the most important books for young people at all. I've read it 20 times, 100 times to go... The charachters and the poems match perfectly, a lovely story that changes life! Carpe Diem!"
4,"Carpe Diem, a really good book!","I enjoyed reading ""Dead Poets Society"", because I think it's a very special book. The topic is not usual though.Sometimes the story was a bit boring. But when I had finished the book I was very thoughtful. I couldn't understand the reaction of Mr. Nolan and Mr. Perry because I liked Mr. Keating and his style of teaching. His ideas of enjoying life and trying to be extraordinary were very interesting. He could also make me think about my own life and how to live it. He showed his students that they had only one life and that they had to bear responsibility for it. And I think that's right.The novel can also show parents what can happen if they tell their children how to live. They shouldn't decide about their children's life."
3,Good novel,"I have found it a very good book. It shows the life of some American students in a private school, about their problems and their dreams.The book is written with a lot of emotions and it deals the conflict between the parents, the school administration and the dreams of the students."
4,Good book!,"**** Good book!I find it a very good book. It's interesting to read. The book goes about a school. And the four pillars of the school are: ""Tradition! Honor! Discipline! Excellence!"" But there's a teacher, whose name is Mr. Keating, and he taught his students that every one should care about himself and that they should size life (carpe diem) I think the book shows that if we want something really bad then we have to fight for that with all our might."
3,Not so good in winter.,"The shoulder strap works well as long as the clothing it is sitting on is not very smooth, for example it keeps slipping off of my shoulder when I am wearing a smooth winter coat. It needs more friction material, like rubber, to make it grip more."
2,Doesn't stay on shoulder,"This is a high-quality strap with a rather glaring flaw: it doesn't stay on your shoulder. The very first bullet point in the product description states: ""Anti-slip surface prevents strap from sliding off shoulder"". Unfortunately, the ""anti-slip surface"" is actually relatively smooth and slippery. If they fixed this issue, it would be a five star product.I ended up purchasing the strap made by Lowepro:Lowepro Deluxe - Shoulder strap - black. It's not as stylish as the Victorinox strap, but it's comfortable and nice and grippy.Hope that helps."
5,Great guided journal,"This is a great guided journal for any woman hoping to uncover God's plan for their life. It really makes you reflect on yourself and your relationship with God. The exercises contained are the basis of the journal, so if you are expecting to read alot of material, you have the wrong book. I really enjoyed it!"
3,Bad shipping practice!,The doll was a gift for my wife on Christmas. When she opened the box she was very disappointed to find the box partially crushed in many places. A barbie collector knows that this will greatly reduce the value of a doll.The reason for the crushing was obvious. The barbie doll was placed in a tight fitting cardbord box with no packing materials to protect the doll and shipped to me. We are not happy.
4,2007 Holiday Barbie,"As has become a custom, I ordered the Holiday Barbie for my daughter. She now has a collection of 10 Holiday Barbies and really enjoys receiving them each year and proudly displays them in her room. I think this year's Barbie was a lovely addition to her collection. The pictures just didn't do her justice."
2,condition of doll,"Nothing wrong with the doll. Since we collect these Holiday Barbie dolls, we were disappointed that the case was cracked. Seller did not disclose this in the description."
5,What I hear...,"...is a very interesting, swinging pianist - reminds me of Herbie Hancock's sound from his awesome Blue Note recordings of the 60s - we can always use more of that- I call it New York City Nightclub Blues Music."
5,Wonderful product.,"I too grew up in England, where Dettol was a house hold staple. I now live on a horse farm in Oregon, and we take in rescues to heal and re-hab. Some of these horses have appalling wounds and illness's, so I have quite a challenge to keep everything clean and up to par.We use Dettol for cleaning wounds, stables, blankets and rugs...you name it, we use it. SO glad we can get it here now. Thanks.."
3,Too many personal anecdotes,"Lots of good points in this book, but each is illustrated with too many personal anecdotes of people who were victims in different ways. I get the point without all the hard luck stories going on for page after page.This book is an important read, but could have been a lot shorter."
1,There is plenty wrong --- but,"I work in healthcare. I know there are many wrongs. The key to correcting them, however, is not factless raving. There is very little factual data, and flat out mis-statements and mis-leading galore. This is a feel-good book for those who have already come to pre-concieved conclusions about how evil our system is--and I agree that there are numerous wrongs--but books like this, that don;t bother to learn about all sides of an issue and prints half-truths?? this harms more than helps"
3,Better late than never!,"'Surviving a Successful Heart Attack' left the author and me with many unanswered questions - 'Critical Condition' gives some valid answers and valuable insight on the real reason that we are prescribed many of the medicines that we take today. I have eliminated my coffee habit with the help of a wonderful coffee substitute made from soya beans called ""Soyffee"", I'm feeling so much better. My doctor recommended it to help lower my cholesterol and promote strong bones. It's available online at www.S o y c o f f e e.com to find it. This book contains a bounty of research and facts from several sources that show the systematic failure of our 'for profit' healthcare system and how big companies have spent 100's of millions to hide the facts from us."
1,"Great research, woeful wisdom","If you think healthcare is expensive now, wait until its FREE.I thought these guys were famous and brilliant.It used to be, ""give people a chicken for every pot."" Now its, ""... give liver transplants to every alcoholic, give a lung transplant to every smoker, give free healthcare to every fat slob who gets diabetes from his loathsomeness and give every citizen preventative care; don't make the poor souls be responsible for their own health (and while we are at it, let's sue McDonalds for serving too large a portion).This whole book is a political diatribe that can be summarized by their last sentence: "" ... we can do what every other civilized nation on earth does - take care of our citizens."" Yeah, great idea. Which civilized nations would those be? EVERY, they claim. It is that tone, found in every chapter, that weakens this book.This subject matter needs balanced description and analysis. This book doesn't do it."
5,Wish I'd had this Book in 2003!,"Boy! Do I wish I'd had this book and the information inside in 2003! My father was stuck very deep in the mud of the HMO system and trying to fight lung cancer. The doctors were overworked and understaffed, and we had to be his advocate every step of the way. We asked a lot of questions much to their obvious consternation. This book would have helped us to aim our questions with precision, to the appropriate topics, which is hard to do when you're overwelmed with emotions.So much was explained in this must have handbook, that I have a new clarity of the situation in hindsite.Thank you Ms. Ehrenclou for your insight! Brillant!J. Bertolus, Los Angeles"
3,Important but Unsatisfying,"I agree with the authors on the big picture: the state of health care in the U.S. is a scandal that should lead the news most nights. But the authors are able to describe only the tip of this iceberg, the part most exposed to the public. By this I mean that most of the book is a series of incidents along the lines of ""Mr. X tried to get procedure Y but was denied for crappy reason Z."" Or ""HealthShysters, Inc. went under and left a million people without medical care.""I was hoping for an analysis which would examine more closely the economic and politcal roots of the current predicament. The subtitle of the book, after all, is ""How Health Car in America Became Big Business and Bad Medicine""-- but I felt that precisely ""how"" is too often elided.On the other hand, the current one is an easy read and a reasonable introduction to an important issue."
3,"Many scary examples, little on a solution","I won't give an exhaustive review as others have done so well. I just wanted to add my voice to those that note this book contains many well-researched examples of just how bad things have become. What the book does not do, however, is give a thorough and balanced look at possible solutions. One must wait until the last chapter, which is quite short, to read about one possible solution - and even this one possibility is not covered in great detail. So, I would recommend you read the book just so you see that, even if your experience has not been bad, it definitely has been very much so for others. But you really will not find ""what we should do about it."""
2,lame,"Lame plot & story. I usually like anything Star Trek.Captain Sulu Adventures were a good idea, but the stories are just bad."
3,Too little...,"The hat looks good for the price...didn't realize that the braid trim is multi-colored in between the gold...would prefer just gold. The main problem is that it's pretty small and cannot be worn with the wig, as shown, too...unless the guy has a really small head. It's snug even without a wig. I hoped he could wear the wig + the hat."
1,Not for me,I just did not like it. I guess others will like it but this video was not for me. I threw it away after one viewing.
4,good choice of orchestra background,"I picked this cd based on the ratings and after reading his website. As a first time listener to his music I was shocked that I never fell upon his greatness before. With the orchestra backing him the songs came out very mature and crisp. From the popular ""Once Bitten Twice Shy"" to ""Rest In Peace"" and on this album is a great companion for those evenings when a dark room and a great whisky come together! Strongly reccomend..."
1,Does not fit 1990 DEodge Dakota.,Item will not fit 1990 Dakota Pickup by Dodge. The shaft hole is too large for the motor shaft and the blade arms will not rotate.
4,GOT TO READ THIS BOOK,I read Mayhem on Mackinaw Island. I gave it four stars because it is a good book.I liked the book because it is very exciting. A part that I liked was when Sandy and Tim got stuck in a very scary version on Mackinaw Island.There is unusual monsters out to get them. Tim and Sandy need to get out of this island. Will they?
5,Author knows how to get kids reading.,"This author knows how to keep a reader interested from beginning until end. Great book for kids, and listening tomy grandson read it kept me interested as well!"
5,Hilarious!,"This movie is some of Brandon Dicamillo's, Bam Margera's and Ryan Dunn's best work. The movie was completely entertaining and had me laughing almost nonstop. But be warned, if you watch it everyday for three weeks straight, it gets a bit boring. ^_^"
4,Very Useful Book,"PACKED with information. Sometimes a lot to sift through to find exactly what I need, but so far, everything I've really needed has been in this book. Rolling along in middle age, I find reading complicated or lengthy material difficult on-line--so this hard copy works really well for me.I've even impressed my (young adult) children with things gleaned from this book--how sweet is that!"
5,LET'S GET THIS CLASSIC ON DVD NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The only thing I can add to the fine reviews already listed is this: WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD WAITING FOR ???????????? GET THIS CLASSIC FILM ON DVD NOW!!! IT, LIKE 99% OF GREGORY PECK MOVIES SHOULD ALL BE ON DVD, SO GO MAN (OR WOMAN) GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Capt. Newman - Excellent rendition!,"I was surprised, particularly because this is only a standard play copy, but this disc renders a very fine visual."
5,Capt Newman on DvD,Finally on DVD and the quality is excellent indeed. I'm surprized how well this came out. A timeless classic. Timeless performances too !! A must have.I love this old story. Its wonderfull to see all the old faces as they started their film careers in this flick and went on to bigger and better things.For the deaf and hard of hearing this film has optional subtitles.
5,Captain Neuman M.D.,To me this was one of Gregory Pecks best movies ever! It had an all star cast and not a swear word or explesid sex scenes in it. Just an enjoyable movie for the whole family. Its to bad that movies today have to ruin them by throwing in the trash that they do. They could learn a lesson from walt disney movies. They just play them over and over for the new gererations of kids and they never get old. I'd watch them before I'll watch the trash hollywood produces nowdays!
5,"Gregory Peck's Captain Newman, M.D.","I've reviewed Gregory Peck's Twelve O'Clock High (see that in Amazon.com), which I argue was really based on Viscount Air Marshall T. Harris (""Bomber"" Harris) - see my review of the latter. Gregory Peck has a habit of doing only Class Act movies, which for the benefit of the ""Cool Alpha-Wave"" generation means Only the Best. Not many people recall now that Captain Newman, M.D. was based on a real story - the story of Beaumont Military Hospital in Beaumont, Texas (near El Paso). I've argued in many of my reviews for greater public funding for the U.S. Veterans Administration, and Captain Newman, M.D. is better than all of my arguments. There really were and are devoted Army Psychiatrists like Captain Newman - a true Man for All Seasons, and devoted and ingenious assistants like his, and perhaps most important, Veterans in and out of the hospitals who gave their lives and their health for us."
4,Just what the doctor ordered,"This is a really enjoyable movie with good performances. I don't think they could get a cast like this together nowadays withount conflict on the set. Gregory Peck is as good as ever playing the title role. Tony Curtis is hilarious in a suuporting part. Angie Dickinson never looked better. Bobby Darin was up for an Oscar for his protrayal of a deeply trouble airman. I think the best performance goes to Eddie Albert as the troubled military staffer. Also, Robert Duvall puts in a fine show. It is fun and serious and extremely watchable."
5,Much more than we thought!,"We were about to have a baby and my wife and I realized that having a simple camcorder would be nice thing to have. I wasn't shopping for anything fancy, and I certainly wasn't in the market to make films, however, for the price, this little Hi-8 camcorder does a great jop. In fact, its taping quality is fantistic.The only thing that I wish that it had was image stablization. A tri-pod fixes that problem. It has many features that we would never use, but is still nice to see them there. My wife and I were impressed with the quality of the picture the very first time we watched a video.Also, one thing to look out for, Samsung camcorder batteries are hard to find. For some reason, other than Samsung, Rayovac is the only company that makes a backup battery for this camcorder.But enjoy, you won't be disapointed."
5,"You might have most of this already, but there's new stitches, too.","I wondered what this would include, as I had Walker's First and Second Treasury of Knitting Patterns, Charted Knitting Designs (now known as The Third Treasury of Knitting Patterns) as well as a couple of smaller books with additional patterns devised by Ms. Walker. I knew this Fourth Treasury was primarily made up of those smaller books, but there are also several new stitches that Ms. Walker has added. If you are a knitter, you want this book on your shelf."
1,Fourth Treasury of Knitting Patterns,"This fourth book in the series was a disappointment. There were some patterns from the previous ""Treasuries"" and the new patterns seemed to me to be leftovers and not very interesting. I returned the book."
2,Diasappointing,"Compared to her other masterworks, this volume of Barbara Walker's is an ""I want my money back"" disappointment."
2,way down,"[...]. Patterns are not very interesting, charts are a horror, and high concentration of cables makes it totally boring, at least for me. One of the last patterns looks as if the author attempted to knit bi-color brioche honeycomb and failed, and so she surrendered the result to the readers as a ""fancy stitch"". I recall producing such and more fanciful stitches by pure chance, while learning to knit correctly something else.I still give it two stars because photography is good and because someone else may find the stitches interesting. Buy it if you wish, but a must-have it is not."
3,A bit disappointing,"Not as good as the first two. I don't care for any of the mosaic patterns, but there are a lot of very nice lace stitches. The book would be better without the inclusion of most of the Sampler Knitting as well as the ""patterns"". I don't think this Treasury warrants a $30 price tag. I wish I would have been able to look at this first, because I probably would have spent the money on a different knitting book."
5,Best new fantacy series yet!,"I think this book, as the others, were Awesome! I've been really into Unicorns and this just tops the cake. It's got fantacy, adventure and a little comedy also. I exceede the reading age, but these books have such a good story line I'm excited for the rest of the series to get printed."
1,Simply Junk.,"My mother received this as a gift, but since she already had a coffee pot, I quickly acted at the opportunity to take it off her hands. After one use, I knew I needed a different coffee maker. This coffee maker doesn't take normal accordion sided filters like every other maker... NO, it uses these wacky wedge style ones that most convince stores don't carry. The water reservoir is only one inch wide and in the shape of a banana... good luck pouring any water without spilling. After a cup of coffee has brewed, condensation collects on the top lid, so when you open it to brew another pot, the water runs down the back and spills all over the counter. The brushed steel buttons and front cover attract finger prints quickly, as if magnets. It brews coffee, but barely. Do yourself a favor and buy anything else but this."
1,Coffee Pot has problems,"We got the coffee pot for free, but of course, we had to buy $40 in coffee and join the club. However, the glass coffee pot broke in the dishwasher after the first 3 months. We put it in the dishwasher as usual, but when we pulled it out, a chunk of the side was missing. We can only assume that it couldn't take the heat.There are two other problems with this coffee pot One is that the area to pour the water in is very narrow. No matter how many ways you tried to pour the water in, it would always pour over the side. The second is, if you are making a fresh pot of coffee using filtered refrigerator water, it doesn't heat the water properly. It heats it as if it is room temperature to begin with, so we have to use tap water when making fresh pots of coffee on Saturdays and Sundays."
2,water & coffee spills all the time.,"Coffee spills every time you try to pour coffee into cup, if you try to pour the coffee by lifting the lid with your thumb you get a steam burn on your hand & thumb. Then there is the issue when you lift the lid to start a pot of coffee. When the lid is lifted condensate water from the previous pot pours down the backside of the pot and on to the countertop. You can't pour or brew a pot a coffee with this unless you have a towel at the ready. We got it when we bought the gevalia to get the reduced cost price. We have found that the coffee itself is way over priced. $35. for 2 bearly one pound bags plus S&H!!! We are stuck in this coffee purchase program for another 20 some weeks then we will get out of it. We would not recommend this product stick to the local department store brewers."
2,"Don't waste time on this machine, even if it's free!","I just receieved this exact coffeemaker from Gevelia. First of all, the coffemaker is designed like a tripod, with the weight concentrated in the front. When you add the glass pot, it's a disaster waiting to happen. Secondly, after two uses, the water level indicator ball quit working. I would not purchase this coffeemaker again. I actually found this coffeemaker while looking for a replacement on Amazon. I'm giving the unit 2 stars because it brewed coffee. Not well, but it was coffee."
3,"Works great, but the Carafe breaks to easily...",I love the coffeemaker but the carafe cracks and breaks for no reason at all. I feel that the company should ship out everyone who has one at least two to three replacement carafe's for the cracking issue.
1,Customer Service,"Over 3 months ago in early January, 2009, I ordered a replacement carafe for the ""free"" coffee maker they sent me. The wrong one was sent. I called and was assured they would send me a return address label. After a month, I called again and was told the same thing. The third time I asked for a supervisor and was told it would be handled. The forth time, I threatened to put up a youtube video and promised results. This was Andy employee number 643113 on April 2. Still nothing in the mail. On April 20 I called again and was told that my credit card had been refunded, but to get the proper carafe I had to re-order and be charged. I said, ""You have got to be kidding. After 3 months of hell?"" I still have not heard from them, nor do I expect to. I am stuck with the wrong carafe cluttering my house. I sent this review to Gevalia and they simply repeated their new song: your account was refunded to get the correct carafe, re-order. Fat chance!"
3,Debra's Dance is Dazzling!,"Lang's penultimate film[s] is not his best effort, but this DVD does it justice with its brilliant color and sharp image. The single best scene is Debra Paget's near-nude dance in the second film. In my opinion, she was hotter than Marilyn Monroe and should have been better known back in the 50s. Originally a dancer, she showed she could act in a number of 50s releases. A must for Paget fans."
4,A Fast-Paced Swedish Thriller,"In Stockholm, on St. Lucy's feast day, a bandit daringly robs a crowded post office. Within a fortnight, two witnesses are dead. Two cops from vice squad, Johansson and Jarnebring, who were the first to the crime scene, pursue all leads and identify a suspect, an arrogant member of the elite secret police, a man assigned to guard the Minister of Justice. Just when the beat cops think they've tightened the noose around the suspect, loose ends begin to appear, witnesses lose their certainty, alibis crop up, and even the cops doubt what they've seen. Who is hiding the suspect and why? This is a fast-paced modern thriller, in stark contrast to the darker, more deliberate Widerberg work The Man on The Roof (1976). Viewers are treated to high-speed chases and panoramas of Stockholm, great cinematography and plot twists."
5,Great hair dye!,I have been using this product for years. It really does cover the gray completely and it gives my hair a healthy natural look and texture. I love it since it does not contain harsh peroxides or ammonia. It is easy on my lungs and skin (I get a skin rash with other products). I recommend Water Works Hair Color highly!
5,Hot!,"These cats are hot. Every track is different but still a banger. There's not too much that's pop on this album, but who cares? Hip-hop is for the underground, Soul Arc keeps it there. Hopefully Big Money and Wize Dome will do solo albums! Some of the artists could have used more time to shine but they held their own. All together a nice compilation."
2,Warning to Parents,"Music is upbeat but content is deceiving. It appears to be a Christian tape, but some songs were disturbing. ""Lady Bug"" is about a little boy that fries bugs with a magnifying glass. The majority of the song focuses on gross details with a brief tag that the boy is a thug. (Little boys are more likely to pick up on the how too's of bug incineration.) Very concerned with ""My own Church"". It encourages the mindset that corporate worship is on the same level as going to a circus. It is disrespectful and in poor taste. The artists are talented, but trying to appear not to take their faith too seriously so they appeal to secular market as well. Dissappointing at best, if you were looking for a good Christian cd."
4,Good toy for girl or boy,"This is an adorable toy for toddlers, it sings and says many different things when you use the blocks to drive down the ramp and drive them thru the car wash. My daughter also has the Happy Home set which inspired me to buy this Wash & Wax set. She loves them!"
3,An amiable read,"Despite the potentially controversial subject matter -- an African-American athlete accused of rape -- Stockley has written another amiable, charming page turner. Lots of Southern atmosphere, agreeable characters, plot twists that are only semi-predictable. If I didn't fly so much, no doubt I would be reading more serious stuff (Proust? Mann? Musil? In my dreams), But there are times when only undemanding fare will do. And Stockley's a reliable fellow when the need arises. You won't read it with fevered excitement, but you won't be sorry you plucked it off the wire racks, either."
2,weak,"Easy to read, but not worth the effort. The story plods along for 350 pages with almost no action, then finally we get to the trial. But with only a couple of pages left, the jury returns a verdict with practically no explanation of how they could have arrived at it. Very disappointing."
1,poor design and numbers fade,"do not buy this product, the case is terrible, the digital numbers on the screen sometimes fades and the sound is not th quality you would expect, please consider another option"
2,Weak,"This item is weak. The prime problem is that it does not have 87.9 FM which is the best freq to transmit on in most markets. Second problem is it cycles by single digit increments (IE 88.1, 88.2, 88.3). When is the last time you rocked out on 99.2 FM? Chances are never. Even on open frequencies, of which there are not may of unless you are out in the stix, it has a hard time locking in. Overall, not the best option I have seen. I found 1 station that this thing will work on which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1."
5,Excellent shampoo,"This is an excellent shampoo to get hair clean without stripping it of essential oils and leaving it dry. Once you use this product, you will never want to use any other shampoo."
5,"Three Delightful Episodes from ""Lassie""","You won't be disappointed with these episodes! Two episodes are from 1958 and the third from 1960. All episodes feature June Lockhart, Jon Provost, and Hugh Reilly. All episodes are b/w.In the first episode (1958), Lassie falls in love with an old rocking chair. When the Martins send the chair to an auction, Lassie finds a way to get it back!In episode two (1958), Timmy's Peace Patrol funds are stolen and Lassie uses her tracking skills to capture the thief. The Lone Ranger appears in the finale to congratulate Timmy for his success. Yippee!In episode three (1960), Timmy and his mother visit the Grand Canyon. Timmy ventures onto a dangerous ledge alone but Lassie and a blind musician guide Timmy to safety.The dvd is of excellent quality. The third episode includes wonderful location shots of the Grand Canyon. These are warm, wonderful stories that will delight all viewers."
4,Defacing the Readers Digest,"I bought this because I can't find a copy of the film,my third generation video is in poor repair. I was not disappointed in this recording. First class use of words so seldom found these days and you will notice something new each listening. Classic lines of the ""so inbred even the bulldogs got a club foot"" nature make for pleasing car journeys and the consumption of cheap red wine heightens the enjoyment. Splendid."
3,Changing times?,"Setting the hounds on Jehovah's witnesses and shooting at a hang-glider are still funny, but referring to Africans as ""Jungle Bunnies"" wasn't ever funny."
1,MANAGE MODE!!!!!!!!!,"Lousy manager mode!!Playing in manager mode is just a full screen graphic. Quite honestly, playing on my commodore 64 was more fun. I remember Apple computer released a game in the 80s that had a manager mode that had GRAPHICS. And today's game makers can't achieve this?Graphics average. Pitching is fairly accurate... when your pitcher gets tired or rattled, the aim gets shakey and harder to hit your mark... I like that. This also allows for pitches to be balls, which leads to the ""ever so rare"" BASE ON BALLS.Hitting is done by pulling back on the R3 stick and releasing to swing. You can't aim WHERE to swing. Ultimately, it's too easy.Also, controls, at times, are WAY TOO CONFUSING. I was batting one time, bumped something ???? and my RIGHT HANDED batter switched to a LEFTY!!??This game is a mess. Not to mention, after playing 4 games of a 5 game series, while loading up game 5, it locked up on me.BOO HISS! AND GIVE US A MANAGER MODE WITH GRAPHICS!!"
1,Worse Thing To Happen To Baseball Since Steroids,"This game is awful. I rarely write reviews, but when something blows this bad I'm left with no choice. Most people have the same complaint; the pitching is the worst ever and the fielding leaves a lot to be desired. If you want to buy a baseball game, don't buy this one."
1,A Mess,"I was pretty excited about getting this game based on all the pre-hype. As I waited for it I also puchased MLB 06 - The Show. Bottom line buy MLB 2006 The Show. 2K6 has bad graphics, non-intuitive controls and rosters that are not updated. Situations are unrealistic and it is as if people who have never seen a baseball game built this thing. A tremendous disappointment for something that took unti April 10 to be delivered."
1,Waste of money,"I'm not going to provide a long-winded review of this game. Save that for other reviewers who have already given great insight into the problems associated with this title. Simply, this is the worst baseball game I have played - EVER. I go back to the days of Bases Loaded, RBI Baseball, and others on NES -- and this game is so badly made it's almost comical. The graphics look like they were designed for the original Playstation, the controls are tedious, the action is boring, the commentary is flawed, the players don't look ""natural,"" and the load times take forever. AVOID. I just traded mine in..."
1,I want my money back,This is just a rip off. What were they thinking? I rather play baseball on a Coleco Vision than this lame game.
1,Absolutely horrible STAY FAR AWAY,"Absolutely the worst baseball game I have ever played. HORRID graphics, choppy animations, poor player animations, player faces that look like zombies. Don't even get me started on the game play. Players not tagging up, people not covering the base, fielders not chasing the ball, pitchers batting cleanup in the lineup. What an absolute mess. There's literally nothing good about this game. If you have a PS2, get MLB 06 The Show (which happens to be excellent), if you don't have a PS2, don't buy a MLB game this year because there are no good ones. Complete and utter disappointement!"
3,"not bad, but rosters are horrible","the gameplay was fine, but the rosters were wrong. alot of the players that were included in mlb 06:the show were simply not in this game.kenji johjima and kevin millar are both in the show but not in 2k6.and i'm sick of games changing the names of players they can't use in the games.if you're not gonna put their real name and likeness,don't even include them in the game at all.2k6 had players on the rosters that got released or retired last year,or 2 years ago.overall, it was just a ok game.the show is alot better.and that's not saying much, because i only gave the show barely 4."
2,Not worth the wait,"The graphics seem cluttered, like they tried to put too much in. Gameplay is not all that realistic. Also, the commentary has bugs in it. For example, I was in the 2nd inning and after my pitcher got the final out of the inning, the coomentary said ""he's through 7, only 2 more to go"". Not a good experience at all."
2,Fun but gets old fast,"I was hoping to get a bargain when I bought this for 30 dollars. WORST choice of my life.Graphics:1/10Batters have faces and a body.Horrid lag between batters, innings, good play highlights, and after strike outs.Sound:3/10Music is ok until you hear the same song again in a 5 minute spanAnnouncers get annoying....FASTControls:6/10One you get used to them it isn't so badPlayability:ModerateOverall:3.5/10Outdated quicklyMy recommendation:Don't get 2k7 unless you plan to use it as a coaster."
1,This game sucks!,"The graphics are horrible! The faces of the players are smushed on their bodies to make it look like they just got ran over by a truck! The pitching is very confusing to figure out. It all depends on when you release the ball when the yellow circle is a certain size. It's so stupid. I got MLB O6 :The Show and let me tell ya, the graphics are awesome and everything is much better. Save yourself from buying another crappy 2K baseball game and get SONY'S game. MLB 06: The Show. You'll thank me later."
1,Q: how do you spell joke? ANS: MLB 2K6,"i did'nt think it was possible to make a game worst than MLB 06 ''the show'' but they did. EA sports please come back and make the game fun again, MLB 2K6 is a complete joke, the graphics are horrible and the game play is sluggish. do not waste your money on either, these games were thrown together because the systems ( platstation 2 ) and (x-box) are on their way out.........."
1,ps2 Major League Baseball 2K6,"Like many I waited with long anticipation for this games release.I was very disappointed. If you are like me and enjoy controlling each team in the season mode, you are out of luck. They changed it to where you can only control four teams. Also its not updated. For example the St. Louis Cardinals play in a brand new ballpark this year. But the game has them still playing in the old one. Also the graphics are not at all better then last years. Its a giant step backwards. My advice is save your money and replay 2K5 by updating the rosters yourself and create new players. All MLB teams have current rosters posted on their Web Sites. Last years game was much better."
2,Not as good as 2k5,"It's not nearly as good as 2k5. But that is just my first impression. With time, and adjusting to the new and more advanced controller system, it might have potential. Graphics are a step down from last year too. My suggestion, rent it first and play a couple of games of it. You'll probably want to change the default camera settings"
2,Not good....Really not good.,"I agree with the other reviewers who have expressed disappointment after buying this game after MLB '06 the Show. If you have niether and you're gonna choose one, get The Show. NO DOUBT; HANDS DOWN.2K6's graphics are lame; MVP '05 was way better. The game play is okay. Just okay. Hitting is less challenging than The Show at a similar skill level. The rosters are just horrible. It looks like they finished reseraching and settled on the rosters in December!The only edge I'd give to 2K6 over The Show is the audio. This is also the only thing that I dislike about The Show. In 2K6, the commentators are ESPN's John Miller and Joe Morgan. The Show has three pretty lame homers. 2K6 did a really good job getting the audio to fit the context of the game. Not so for The Show.Overall, though, 2K6 is really not much fun, and it doesn't look very good at all."
1,Flush your money down the toilet...,"I bought mbl:the show and 2k6, figuring I would compare the two and keep the better one. While ""the show"" isn't perfect, it will be the one I'm keeping. 2k6 is awful. The announcers are not at all relevant, and the gameplay is horrid. I had two straight games where in the 9th inning, with a one run lead, a shallow fly ball was hit. As I am standing under it, another outfielder comes running into the play. I press the ""call off"" button, butit doesn't matter. Ball drops on the ground, my guy can't pick it up once he gets to it, inside the park home run, game over. The second time this happened to me, I pulled the game out and put it on Ebay. Right now it's $.99 and if it sells for that, I would still be getting a bargain. If you want baseball, the best MLB action you can get is ""the show"" (unfortunately)... can't someone remake ""baseball stars"" for the old NES?"
3,A general book on monolithics,"This is a general reference on refractories. Not being an expert in this area, this book covers a wide range of material. The book covers monolithic refractories (powder which is then generally combined with water before application by spraying, casting or gunning - not bricks).Sections cover the raw materials and each individual sub-class within monolithics. There are sections on wear mechanisms and manufacturing techniques.The book has a lot of information which is quite useful, but working in a research setting, I am not too sure how useful this would be to the professional working in the area. There is little information on the practical installation of refractories, rather more about the raw materials and the different properties about each class within monolithics."
3,"Good laptop, but....","I bought this laptop 2 days ago and it came OVER LOADED with 3rd party software like Vongo, AOl and more. The laptop performs well under ""normal"" usage, but under stress, it lags a lot, making it very uncomfortable to work on. The main reason why I rated this laptop with a 3 stars is because the computer gets WAYYYYYYY to hot. It seems that HP didn't create a proper heat dissipation system because on the left hand side (where you rest you left wrist) gets way too hot, it even radiates through the keyboard.Aside from that, the laptop is very tempting for the price, and the remote is just beautiful, you can even turn you computer on with it.Bottom line is, I couldn't stand the heat, so I ended up returning this machine... but if you don't care a little heat on you wrist.... then go for it."
1,DV6458SE - pile of junk,"I bought this computer with high hopes. So far, it's been nothing but a disappointment. I've had nothing but trouble with the wireless card, as well as the ethernet card. After 2 months of frustration, I've finally shipped the unit back to HP for repairs. I am giving the thing to my nephew. I am getting another Sony."
4,My new pc,"Me gusto mucho mi nueva pc... Estoy muy contenta con ella. Tan solo tengo como queja un sonido que emite un poco fuerte cuando no esta conectada a la electricidad, pero de resto es una muy buena maquina, muy completa a un precio bastante razonable."
5,Good stuff,"Awesome Piece of equipment.The buttons on the touchpad seem a bit dodgey, but the rest of it is very sleek and sexy. Very decent laptop for a very decent price. I find the remote very cool, fits in nicely and pops out just as simply.Lots of unecessary software installed on this little beauty tho. Nothing a trip to control panel wont fix tho :). I know its not optimal, but iv set mine up and am using it as a development pc, its running quite well, so its all good :)The clincher however should be the 20x15 cm notebook cleaning cloth that comes along with it. Ultimate dust domination. GG, well played."
2,Dissappointed,The battery falls out of this laptop whenever you pick it up. I took the first one back thinking it was broken but come to find out it is the way they are made. Since I had purchased this one specificaly for the portibility I am not happy about this feature which seems to me would have been very easy to prevent. I have to duck tape the battery in in order to move from place to place. Doesn't that look nice? Our previous laptop was a tobisha and I wish now I had purchased a new tobisha instead
1,Fatal flaw,"I have to agree with another reviewer who said his/her laptop worked great until 1 1/2 years after purchase. The same thing happened to mine. It just died yesterday and it's been about 1 1/2 years.... The same thing (booting for 1 second then the laptop shuts itself off on its own with a single beep) happened 2 months ago then it resurrected itself without any intervention. Then it happened yesterday and now it's long gone... The hp service reps are completely useless; they just try to get money from you by charing you for diagnosis then wanting to charge more if repair is needed. (I talked to them on the phone and I'm not shipping my laptop) I definitely don't want to do that so now I have to buy another laptop. I've never had any problem with hp laptops before (I owned 2 other than the current one, and both are still running well) and I kinda feel ""betrayed"" by hp... The laptop was indeed working well until it died. But 1 1/2 years of service isn't enough for having spent $1000."
4,"Nice, good price, thin and light","Everything top drawer with this notebook. 'Neat package' is the best way to put it. The only reason I cannot give this 5 stars is that the WXGA screen (standard in all corners of the 15.4"" notebook world) is a real drag. It's just fine for my 84 year old mother who does e-mail every day and edits books for publication (that's who I bought it for to upgrade her 5 year old notebook), but I'm spoiled by my 17"" VAIO 1920x1200 screen."
1,Customer service? Forget it.,"If you want a good computer, forget HP, especially on their customer service. My laptop was under warranty, and when the charger went bad, after a couple of months, I had to call them several times, and it took two months for the replacement to arrive. So, if your thinking of an HP, forget about it. Go for Dell, Sony, Gateway. They know how to treat their customers."
2,Problems,My dog is still able to lower it with his nose to get to the wound. Their is also no directions.
3,Not my favorite math book,"I used this book for an undergraduate algebraic geometry class. Most of the class absolutely hated it; I didn't feel quite as strongly. The organization is not bad, and while most beginning problems are trivial, latter ones are interesting but not unreachable.I like parsimonious texts, but at times the author goes too far, using unexplained notation (sorry I forget where.) More seriously, there's a lot of cases where the author trades providing intuition for parsimony; for example, writing that ""prime implies irreducible, but the other way round is false in general"". In my opinion, a simple example here would be worth the fraction of a page.Sorry I don't have a good reference to go to; I like the style of Lang's Algebra and Eisenbud's Commutative Algebra, but they may not be great introductory material. I've heard Dummit and Foote or Fraleigh are good; maybe check math.stackexchange for recommendations [...]"
3,Helpful to a point,"It could have been because my teacher asked us very ambiguous questions, but this book was not very helpful when trying to apply its basic examples to broader concepts. It spent too little time on important topics (how doctors and hospitals force a nursing shortage, etc.) and too much time on special topics. I'd recommend purchasing the old version over the newer version though. It's just the same."
5,Satisfied customer,This chuck key replaced the original chuck key to my Makita angle drill. Good quality. It engages the chuck better than the original key. Couldn't beat the price either.
5,chuck key,"This is a hard to find chuck key for a discontinued HP1030 drill. I received the key in a timely manner,for a great price and it worked perfectly."
5,"Smooth, jazzy, stylish Sting","I am a tremendous Sting fan for years...and for years I was wainting for some material, that really leaves an impresion. This is it. What a great material you find in every of the 15 tracks that the DVD has. Every song, and every arragement is stylish, elegant, not loud, but not boring. The musicians are superb, Dominic, Jason, Kipper, Chris and so on; such a great asembly of artists. Good image quality and sound complete a good final product.Sting fanatic or not, this is a piece of music that is well worth it to have, and enjoy."
4,Sting coasting,"Although I am a tremendous fan of Sting, I feel he has ""coasted"" the past several years. This huge band of his can play beautiful music no doubt, but he has a tendancy to not work as hard in a big band. Sting really comes out in a smaller band - the Broken Music tour was MUCH better. The songs on Sacred Love were okay - not my favorite CD. Having said that, this DVD is really enjoyable. It's great to see Sting at his home here in LA just playing music, surrounded by his friends and family. The live footage at the Mayan sounds great, and there are a couple of songs on this DVD that cannot be found elsewhere."
4,Talks too much!,"Great if not outstanding musically! However, if your looking for a concert followed by his thoughts and inspirations - not! Sting thinks he must interlace his music with the spoken word - which greatly takes away from this otherwise incredible work. You begin to drift into that magical place and then the concert cuts away - in the middle of the song - to listen to his thoughts on the tune!Had it been any other musician - I would have shut the damn thing off and asked for my money back."
5,LaVyrle Spencer,"Spencer never lets the reader down. Her characters are people you know from your own real-live experience. Their emotions and actions are as familiar as those of your own familie members and neighbors. I, for one, was sad to see Ms. Spencer retire."
4,I enjoyed this book,I enjoyed reading about the Curran's as Lisa manipulates Bess and Michael into getting back together. Good read! Gwen
2,Predictable from the beginning.,"I recently discovered Spencer's great gift of writing by reading several of her great books, however, if I discovered her through this book, I would have passed her by."
3,a matter of taste,"I am a great fan of Sibelius' violin concerto and have a few recordings.After hearing the much appraised performance by David Ostriach, I still count Joshua Bell's my favourite one for the following reason:The predominant mood of Sibelius' concerto is that of a melancholic mind, therefore, the passion that comes out of it is not the one of the heart, as Ostriach performs it, but of the mind, as Bell so masterfully perfects it in his performance.Ostriach's barely containable passion is more suitable for Russian composers."
1,"Junk. Find it in another brand, if you can.","Used it 3 times within 3 months, before I noticed that it had cracked at every corner of the hex. Would've sent it in for warranty, but it would've cost as much as the tool did to ship it to the manufacturer. Quality 4mm nut drivers are hard to come by, but don't waste your time or money on this one."
5,Only fragrance I wear!,"Tentations by Paloma Picasso for Women, 1 oz Eau De Parfum SprayThis fragrance is difficult to find in retail stores. Really happy I could get it and no longer have to run all over town. Been my fragrance of choice for years and I don't intend to change."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,"Okay this stupid book is cheaply made. The text is small, the diagrams are poorly drawn, and the most important is that the binding is incredibly cheap. As soon as i opened the book the binding cracked and the first pages started to fall out.Since i am a designer and need a reference book, this one will be worthless since it will fall apart and not last. Buy the Mindshare book.I want a refund...."
1,These cables are JUNK!,Don't buy this unit unless you're going to use it for a clothsline. That's all it's good for. The connections are loose and it turned my video display into a bunch of scrambled lines. I only gave it one star because zero stars was not on the drop down list.And because it comes from Office/Tech-Depot it's not as easy to return. To bad I couldn't give it negative stars because of this.
1,Whoops,Blue Ray player - would not playDvd Players - 2 - Would not play on either oneComputer - DVD - PlayedListed as working on home theatre system.... will have to rip and convert to play on HD TV.
2,oh well... :/,"Well Nickelodeon really let me down on this one... and it sadens me to say that, bbut it's the truth. It is a LOT like Disney's High School Musical! and that really stinks because Nickelodeon is FAR BETTER than Disney!!!! ... and they don't need to copy them! Actually the movie itself wasn't so bad, it just makes me mad that Nick did that. shame on Nickelodeon, that was a bad move in the wrong direction for them..."
5,Love it !,"Spectacular is now my all time favorite movie Nolan Funk, Tamin Sursosk, Victoria Justice, and Simon Curtis are the lead characters. I own the Book, Movie, and the Soundtrack, and I never got bored watchin, listening, or reading any of them. This movie is chucked full of singing, Jazz hands, some romance, and backstabbing friends (who Simon Curtis and Victoria Justice play). IT IS GREAT !!!!!!!!!I'm 12 that is why I think it is great (not really because it is halarious!!)=}"
5,Great,Santa brought this for our 4yr old daughter that likes to sleep in her closet...she loves it and something she wont out grow anytime soon.
3,Softer than expected...,"The bag came on time, was softer than I expected, roomy for me (5'2""), but the stitching at the base of the zipper is very poor. It's white (contrasting), is a pretty loose stitch (almost like when you're tacking or basting a seam) and has loose threads sticking out. It looks like repeated zipping and unzipping might cause it to open up. Also, I'm not sure how the stitching will hold up on the quick cord after repeated opening and closing. It's pretty, good for infrequent use, and did I mention that it was soft? I also ordered a junior bag for my daughter (Coleman Catnap) and the outside of the bag is not nearly as smooth and soft as the ""Sleeping Diva."" Would rate it higher, but it doesn't seem that well made, and you can't zip it together with another bag to make a big one."
2,"Cute, but flawed","I chose this sleeping bag because it had a center zipper, plus the pink is cute. Unfortunately, the unbalanced design of this zipper can make it hard to close when you're in the bag (though easy to open). Also, the white fur trim at the top (near your head) seems to be a compelling magnet for dust, dirt and everything that you wouldn't want being drawn toward your face while you're sleeping. Wish I had chosen something else."
5,Worked like a charm,"I couldn't find a gasket for an old, old carburetor. I made one using this product and it works perfectly."
1,A Terrible Camera and piece of junk,This camera needs to go back to the drawing board. The motion sensing does not work when I used the IPview Lite program. I upgraded the firmware and used the latest version of the IPview Lite program(version 5). The ipview lite constantly freezes up after I activate the motion sensing. The quality of the picture is no better than the DCS 900W. I wasted my money and the camera is in storage with the rest of my junk.
2,Not with Vista!,"I am pretty sure that having Vista caused some problems, but I am not really sure. Technical Support was no help and even suggested I return it. Went with a Lynksis instead and it works a lot better and smoother."
1,Save your money!! Don't buy this camera,This camera is a piece of junk. I have upgraded to the latest firmware (1.07) and still can't get the audio to work. You'll be better off buying a trendnet or panasonic IP camera.
1,"sucks. dont get it , believe me","i used this for 6 months since i got it from costco. when you need it to work, it usually does not. it ONLY WORKS ON PC's Internet Explorer. Even its software doesnt work on anything but a PC windows machine. The manual is terrible. it has software in there that doesnt come with the unit. I dont know what the heck they are talking about. Service by phone is in indonesia. And the online software in their help section doesnt come with any manuals or instructions. Its terrible.stay away from dlink."
4,Seller Was quick,"Seller shipped ASAP and even with the ""slow boat"" super saver shipping I had the item in 2 days. Excellent!"
1,Not up to spec.,"I have had nothing but problems with this camera. Every change I make using its IPViewLight program locks the camera up, and I have to cycle power in order to connect again. Secondly the auto record function does not work. I have spent hours on the phone with 4 different tech support agents, 3 of which spoke very good Indian, and could not resolve the problem. Over all the camera is useless to me without the recording function."
1,Horrible Cam for the purpose purchased.,"I bought this cam with the purpose of sending snapshots to me during a day for security reasons. It would nopt work. I changed the settings and modified it to try to trigger better but even if I walked in front of the cam it would not send an email. It would send me emails of ""green screens"" and an occasional actual picture of what I was pointing it at but never did it actually catch motion as far as I am was able to see. After I was having these issues I started looking around at reviews and anyone whom bought this wrote a horrible review. I should have read the reviews before I bought it. I have sent the cam back to Amazon. This camera does not work as advertised at all. Stay away from this camera if you want to do snapshots sent to your email."
3,950G still needs work,"The first one bricked during setup using the CD. The second one setup fine just using a browser, and I installed latest firmware immediately. Also, whenever I have recording started, the unit will lock up after a few hours and require a hard reset, which entails dragging a 100 ft. CAT5 cable across the house. I keep hoping a newer firmware will fix the issues eventually.The 950 does have a good picture, and all the features are great when it's working correctly. Hope this helps."
2,Great Idea but big issues...,Camera will not stay up on wireless network with Dlink router! Firmware has some serious issues. Dlink support was worthless. I returned the camera and bought a Panasonic and never looked back!
1,Installation Software does NOT WORK!,"I just received this security camera for my business and went to install the software (installation wizard) and it errors out. The installation CD is MISSING key files required for the installation to complete. I called D-Link tech support twice and was obviously speaking to Indians half way across the world who could only direct me to the support website and ""keep dowloading files and installing them until it works"". They have no clue! I can't believe D-Link would ship a product where you can't even install the damn software to get past STEP 1."
4,Good Product for the price,This wireless web cam works well for the price. The only thing that needs improvement is the motion sensor using e-mail notification. It send many false motion detection.
1,Lots of headaches with this one...,"The first DCS-950G camera that I received would not connect to the wired network for configuration. I had already thrown the packaging away, so the return became a real headache. The Amazon re-seller made me purchase a new camera (at a higher price) and then I sent back the old camera in that packaging (at the lower price), so I got hit with a $40 mark-up.The replacement camera worked for a couple of weeks, but is now no longer connecting to my wireless network. I have it screwed to a wall and mounted up high, so working on the camera is a real hassle. If I had to do it over again I would not purchase this camera. When it does work, the picture is nice, and the motion detection features are cool, but only when the camera is working!"
5,The Samsung Scl610 Hi8 Camcorder,"This camcorder is one of the best camcoders I have ever seen for it's price. It's one of the lowest priced camcorder that has a screen, also this camcorder is small and light weight. I would highly recomend buying this item, the stylish look shows it all. If you are looking for a good priced small, stylish, and a lightwieght camcorder. Then look no further the Samsung SCL610 Camcorder has everything you need and much much more!"
1,dissapointing too short reads like a childs book .,"this book has no detail to it,way too short only 30 or so pages. reads like child book. big waste of money!im dissapointed amazon yhat you didnt describe this book in some detail! i expected an elaborate book of many facts,not this!"
3,Is too expensive for just 1 cotton bib,I bought this in March 2007. I am a bit disappointed that it is just one very basic cotton bib which cost that much. The quality is acceptable. The pattern is nice.
3,Good flavor but very expensive,This is good beef jerky. Keep in mind however that you paying almost $15 for 3.75 ounce bag. Somehow I failed to notice this when I bought it. I am not quite sure why less than 4 ounces of something costs $8.50 to ship.
4,Decent security,"Well, it is a deterrent but obviously not bulletproof. A good deal, and a fair price. Like the plastic coating which helps prevent scratching the surface of whatever you don't want stolen. 15' is a flexible length to work with, too."
3,Appears to be quality.,"It's thick and pretty stiff. I had to put Velcro on it to keep it all neat and tidy like in the picture, else it would unravel..."
1,Useless gesture,"If you are buying this for anything but ""show"", save yourself the price !Used it to secure my bicycle, Worked for one day, Next morning, no bike, some Pore, disadvantaged, entitled person cut the cable and stole the bike !"
3,I always wondered,"Having seen the Hittites mentioned here and there in the Bible's Old Testament, it was good to finally learn a little more about them. The book was enlightening and interesting to read."
1,Labels Do Not Stick,The labels simply don't stick. After a couple days (at best) the labels will begin to peel away. Definitely sub-standard adhesive.
1,Deceiving.....,"I was about to switch from Brother to Dymo labelmaker, because I thought I'd get twice better deal with this tape, since it costs about the same price for two tapes as for one tape for my brother labelmaker. I then noticed that each tape is exactly twice as short as my brother's So in the end I just end up replacing the tape at twice the rate ! And who enjoys running out of tape in the middle of an word ? So why create the illusion that customers get a deal with this tape ! They don't. They just get more hassle. So while I hate paying so much for Brother's tape, I'd stick with them, since at least they don't unnecessarily waste tape packaging for marketing reasons !"
3,Nice labeling tape,"I like this tape. It's great as long as it's used on a smooth, hard surface. I use it mainly for labeling bins for storage or toys, so it works well for me. I wish it was a little more useful on other surfaces, but for the price and my needs, it works. I only gave it three stars because its stickiness is really dependent upon what you put it on."
2,Mis-leading,This Dymo product is advertised as including two tapes but there is actually only one in the package. I am unhappy with the false advertising.
4,First Album is My Favorite,"Although I think November is an excellent choice for Celtic music, my favorite album so far is ""In A Land So Far Away"". I understand that they not only have changed one of the members of the original group but also have release atleast 2 more albums and would be interested in hearing about them."
5,Great Photographs,"For photographs of Sid, this book is great. All pictures are in black and white.The writing is good as well, peering back to young John Beverly, and his care by drug addicted mother."
3,A short but turbulent life,"Sid Vicious: Rock 'n' Roll Star is a good little overview of the short but turbulent life of a strange and enigmatic figure. It's brevity does not compensate for quality, however and is suitable for dealing with such a short amount of time. The book paints Sid Vicious as a confused, paradoxical kid (I don't know if it is appropriate to refer to him as a man) who was trying to live up to his imagined ideal of what it was to be a 'Sex Pistol'. Along with his drug-fuelled union with Nancy Spungen, it was upholding this reputation that ultimately brought him to his end. This book gives you the required details & images to gain a better understanding of Sid Vicious and his time here on Earth."
2,intresting 'facts',"I find this book as not being a good source of information of Sid Vicious (especially since,from the writings/words of John Lydon,it seems to contradict some things in this book)."
2,Way too Repetitive,"This story chronicled the romances of 4 office friends/coworkers. Although I can honestly say I enjoyed the first short story, the otehr three seemed to be all the same. The writers, didn't have unique ideas for each character, and thus by the last short story I found myself putting the book down and not wanting to finish it."
1,same story 4 times,"The first story was not so bad, but being that there are 4 different authors, you would think that the 4 stories would each be a little bit different. Here is the recap - 4 independent business women, all of which have a dating handicap for one reason or another, meet the men of their dreams within the first few pages of each story. The man changes how they feel about men and then they live happily ever after. BORING!! Not to mention the constant references to designer duds such as Manolos, Hermes, etc. just doesn't bring any value to this book. It worked for Sex and the City because Sarah Jessica Parker is a style icon. This book is a whole lotta ""been there done that"" and is not worth the time it took to read."
2,"Great start, but didn't hold my interest...","I liked the premise of this book. It promised an interesting mix of chick-lit, romance and some very light erotica. The Lipstick Chronicles is a fun book with four stories about four friends and colleagues who meet the loves of their lives in unexpected ways. I liked the first story about an independent CEO and the handsome investor who steals her heart. This book was fun to read at first, but it became tiresome after the third story. The stories were too similar and the characters became tedious after a while. Each story is written by a different author, but there isn't a single thing that differentiates the writers -- it's almost as though one person wrote them. I guess what I'm trying to say is that The Lipstick Chronicles had a good premise, but it didn't hold my interest for long. It just didn't do it for me..."
3,entertaining..yet perdictable,"It was cute, funny and entertaining to go through each stage of the five womens lives. However, the stories were extremely predictable and could have used a few more twist to their stories. I enjoyed it."
1,Now that I've got your attention...,"I am reviewing the not the material on either fomat of this release...I am merely issuing an advisory to future purchasers on this site.I ordered this item after reading a few reviews that were regarding both the CD and the DVD...when I received my item, all I got was the DVD.Please ask the seller whether or not they are offering the DVD AND the CD or one or the other.Every review refers to them as a collective, and sites with information on the original release state that they were released together...HOWEVER, this could be a problem.As for the DVD I did get, it has a lot of music videos for quality songs off of all their albums, and some relatively interesting older tidbits that would rate it 3 stars by itself...but buyer beware."
2,New Primus should not try to act like old Primus,"The DVD is an obvious fan treat, but a supplementary EP does not play in the same memorable key. If this is still the original lineup it certainly does not sound like it. A blatant, superficial attempt to create the old glory days perhaps, but nary an inspirational passage is heard amongst Claypool's constant shallow exercises. For sheer instrumental competency alone our players deserve a tad credit, but throughout this brief, vacant side order of c-rate songwriting, Primus offer extremely little of that distinct chemistry which gave all their off-kilter, funk-fueled musical rantings a lasting depth."
5,If I only had brain?,"Great! A DVD worthy of being a DVD. Rarely does a band put out a video with so much crap on it. Live performances both bootleg and studio quality, all the videos, and any thing else they could throw in. I walked into my local music shop with money burning a hole in my sock wanting something good. My mind had forgotten the joy of a Primus album due to the fact that the last time the trio put anything out was last millenium (see how i make that sound like a longer span of time than it actually is). I'm looking through the haze of album covers when I spot a Primus cover that is unfamiliar. My heart skipped a beat. Then two, then three. Next thing I know i'm on the floor having a heartattack. Anyway, the CD was a good as I expected, although I prefer Brain over Tim anyday (the drums from the Brown album accompany my daily activities since '97). Definitely worth owning from the hardcore Primus/Claypool fan to the passive Music DVD buff."
5,Precious Christmas Story,"This book is an old favorite that my mom read to my siblings and I every Christmas Eve for years. It is a wonderful tale of a young man who finds peace, joy and comfort making baby Jesus smile with his juggling act on Christmas day. Tommy De Paola's illustrations are magnificent. A delightful gift for children (and adults) of all ages. I highly reccommend you start reading it to your own children as I will to mine."
5,Great story,"An inspiring and satisfying book to read with your family. My 16, 7, and 4 year old children loved the story, and asked for it again. And ofcourse, it made mom and dad cry. Great addition to your library."
2,ironing,"This item has be ironed after washing. It is not wrinkle free. Fits good, looks good, I hate to iron."
3,"For God, Queen & Country","This was the second time I viewed this movie. For some inexplicable reason it did not hold my attention as did the first viewing. Sorry, this is the best I can do for this item. I, as all my movies are purchased through Amazon.com."
2,Soldier of Orange,"I ordered a VHS tape of an older movie which was advertised as ""very good condition"". It was not in good condition and some parts of it were almost unviewable. I will never order a tape from Amazon again."
5,Snow White Board Book,This is a cute little board book that my niece (4yrs old) really enjoyed. I like that she can't tear the pages and appreciate the thickness and compactability of this book.
3,Smaller than I thoought,"I should have read measurements better, but is still a nice little book. I especially like the board pages, harder for babies to tear."
1,Too much at once without enough review,"Jillina is a beautiful and talented bellydancer. I have taken enough beginning bellydancing classes to know the basics and thought I would continue on with this DVD set. However, I found it to not be ""beginner-friendly"" in that she does carefully and thoroughly demonstrate each dance move but it is quickly mixed with others and then there are only 2 reps of the quickly put-together routine. Then at the end there is a huge dance routine that is very hard to follow -- and this was just the 1st DVD in the set! It is difficult to repeat/rewind to the correct place in each choreography set to make sure I had it down properly. This is definitely not for ""beginners."""
3,good and bad,"Don't get me wrong, Jillina is a great dancer and has good teaching skills. It is just overwhelmingly apparent that she is a Jazz dancer doing Belly Dance, that it looks not authentic at all. I know this is a problem for American dancers trying to learn the dance from another culture, but I wish there was just one video/dvd out there with a real representation of Middle Eastern Dance. At least this dvd should say describe itself as fusion or American Bellydance. Instead, it claims to be authentic and it is not.It would make a nice gift for a beginner, and it did have some nice combinations/choreography, I just wish they would have told me it was a jazz/fusion thing."
3,pretty good,"There were good and bad points about this series. I was glad that it was a real dance class and not mixed into a workout, but it is hard to get over Jillina's plastic look: fake hair, fake breasts, nose job, plastered on smile, and all the jazz mixed in with her belly dance movements. I got the feeling it was a Hollywood marketing idea or something. There were some good moves, explanation, combinations, but if you buy this, I recommend supplementing your education with videos from some of the real authentic dancers, such as Nourhan Sharif, Amira Mor, Rania, or Susanna Del Vecchio or Suhaila Salimpou."
5,American Cabaret,"Jillina,a Southern California dancer is a dance artist coming from a western jazz and ballet background with training in ME dance. Like many American Oriental dancers Jillina's western dance training shows through very strongly in her style and her performances are designed to please American audiences and their preferences. I think its time we stopped penalizing American Oriental dancers for being what they are- American Oriental Dancers!So, if you are looking for authentic Egyptian Raqs Sharqi, this is not it. However, that does not diminish the fact that this DVD set contains some excellent instruction and combinations. It is fun, well presented and easy to follow for an advanced beginner and higher dancer. If you enjoy performing to Arabic pop you will find value also."
3,Inside look at Polynesian philosophy of life,"Renee Denis came from a fascinatingand unusual family, which no doubt explains her choice of a lifestyle for herself. Her book helps one to understand why the Polynesian extended family overcomes the problems you might think would exist with so many single mothers (including the author). An amazingingly interesting life!"
5,BUY THIS BOOK =),"This was a very good book! I strongly recommend it. I have many books on miscarriage but none touched me liked this one does! The author is very strong for sharing her story. After going thru 5 miscarriages myself so far, I often felt as though she was telling my story too, that she really knew what I felt. I cried at the end of the book, and the ending really gave me hope for my life too. The only bad thing that I can say is that there were some small grammatical errors through out the book FYI."
3,"A decent story worth your time, but not necessarily worth your money.","This graphic novel tells the story of 3 pets who are turned into robotically enhanced killing machines by the government. After their termination is ordered they are allowed to escape by a compassionate doctor. They then set out to find their home while the government tries to hunt them down.The storytelling isn't entirely unique (Homeward Bound meets Robocop?) and it is a fairly short and quick read that is pretty low on dialogue. Still, it's decently entertaining while it lasts.Is it worth $15? If you're really into collecting comics then i'd say yes. The illustrations are pretty good. Otherwise, see if your library has it."
4,"good, dark comic","""We3"", although called a graphic novel, is really more like a graphic short story. A dark, intriguing story of the military-industrial complex's biological experiments and their effects on ordinary living creatures is created efficiently in a few short pages with great art."
5,"We are home, thank you Morrison & Quitely","Loved the art, and as ever, Morrison adds humanity to the strangeness of the world. Quitely 's art is crisp and engrossing, and you're always given something beautiful, if not tragic."
5,Wonderful Graphic Novel,"I loved this story when it first came out. I am so happy with the deluxe edition! The story telling style and the art are perfect together. Highly recommended read. But warning, it is sad in parts."
3,"Great art, and a moving story but...","for a guy like me that loves mature graphic novels, We3 not so great compare to graphic novels like Ex Machina, Y the Last Man or Criminal. It's a fun read, don't get me wrong but the comic is all about how cruel humans are and the humans are the actual beasts in this world. The three animals don't really have that much character to them, they are just poor little things that are scared and wanting to go back ""home"". After reading it once, I never picked it up again.But defiantly check it out, great detailed art, not a bad story and the price is right."
5,fantastic,"I read this and it is such a beautiful, interesting, and overall wonderful comic. It is also very tragic but still badass. fully recommend it!"
5,Morrison and Quitely's best work.,"Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely have done some great work together, this, along with All-Star Superman, stands out on top. The book features Quitely's most detailed work, deserving of the Eisner award it won."
5,We3,"gud book 2 and 3 gud 1 stinkkk boss gud gud boss. 4 stink.The book was creative and graphically very impressive, I am sure 99.9% of the readers can agree in wishing it was longer or had more content, but it was a great read."
4,Dogs of War,"excellent with mind blowing illustrations that should change how comics are translated from the page to the mind. a short story that leaves you wanting more, but a thriller nonetheless."
5,Unbelievably accurate!,"I bought this just for fun, but I found out that there is real truth in it. The book gives very detailed descriptions about the different types of palms. I never had any idea but when I started applying what I learned in the book to friends and family, OMG!!! This stuff is true. I started with my own palms and the information freaked me out. It really makes you think hard. Not only is this fun reading, but it's a real eye-opener."
5,great game,"i just want to say this is a great game. to the guy who said it was bad because of the 1 cart multiplayer: what can you expect? this is the first time anything like this has been done before! if you want all the tracks and cars, you have to use more than 1 cart. be thankful it is there at all.BTW, if you wnat complete 1 cart multiplayer, wait for mario kart: they pushed the launch back to work mor eon the multiplayer"
4,Blueprint for racers to come on the GBA,"The speedy F-ZERO for the Super Nintendo was a lot of fun, but this GBA edition isn't quite as fast. However, there are still reasons to play this game. Maximum Velocity has 21 new tracks with sharp turns, jumps, and road obstacles. Of all the racers that were launched with the GBA (of which there are three) this one is the fastest and has the most difficult aspects of speed, therefore making it the best. The game is smooth and the controls are responsive. The AI is quite good. You can also race with 1-3 friends using the Game Link feature. No matter how you play, this game is quite a rush and you will need this if you like racing games."
4,Meh,This game is alright. There are many cars and tracks but they are very difficult to get. Here is what I rate everythingSound 4.5 (out of 5) the sound is cool but the music is kinda annoyingGraphics 5.0 graphics are great even compared to other games on GBAFun Factor 5.0 this game is fun even though its very frustratingcontrols 4.5 Controls are good but they take awhile to get the hang of but once you do get them down you will be amazed at yourself.There really isn't much else to say about this game.
5,My first GBA game,"This was my first GBA game and I was stunned by the amazing graphics this game featured. It has the best control set-up out of any GameBoy game I've ever played. The race cars are cool and the tracks are amazing. The have obstacles but not too much. The snow tracks can sometimes be tough when you end up slipping on the ice. The key to getting the best turns is to press the ""A"" button repetatively while turning instead of holding it down. FOr more hits about racing, press the SELECT button at the title screen to access the secret tutorial. I would recommend this game because it is the best racing game I've played on the GBA."
4,Great racing game for experts or beginners!,"My sister got this for her 9th birthday, and it's one of the best games i've played since I got my first GameBoy! This is the first racing game I have played so i'm not an expert on the best racing games, but this is perfect if you're a beginner (challenging for experts too!). There are three options:BegginerStandardExpertMaster (Master shows up when you complete the first three in the grand prix)You can choose either multipack racing or singlepack racing so you can race with a friend, all you need are two GBAs,a GBA link cable, and 1 F-Zero cartridge!!!It is hard at first, but it'll get easier as you progress."
1,Dont Like It At All,I did not like this game at all. The graphics [stunk] and so did the tracks. I thought it was so bad i took it back and got my money back. It may just be me but its not worth it.
2,WORST MULTIPLAYER EVER!!,WOW i said at first when i saw the incredibly speeds of F-Zero max velocity and then i hooked up with some of my friends who imported it and the the GBA system and it turns out that you can only choose one car and play on ONE track and all you are is a different color so i advise if you buy the GBA buy the other games and oh yeah mario doesnt... it just takes skill which all the import people dont have!
1,DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!,"This game is the worst game i've ever played, Don't buy it or you will be boared to death.Also i'ts multiplayer(whitch is the only other thing the game offers) needs every one to have a game pack, which is a big waste of money. If your aiming to get this game I suggest you get something different like advance wars or even super mario.Now the average costermer will ask why is this game so bad or you have no proof that it's bad well i'll tell you why. See what you got to do is compleate races and get cars, whats the point? then when youv'e beaten it, what then? any way it's just going to waste you time and money.The unearther strikes agian saveing people time and money tata!"
4,COOOOLLL,This reveiw corresponds to the SNES version of F Zero however I have heard from reliable sources that this is prety much a strait port.This game is a futreristic space racing game.Its very fun(and adictive)the sound and graphics are great(especially for handheld system)Now dont get me wrong this definately improves with no real sign of anything changeing for the worst.
2,WARNING!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this game and I thought it would be the coolest game ever, but little did I know that this game stinks. For one you can barely steer and when you make the tinyest turn you go sliding and hit the edge and get 'zapped'. If you get 'zapped' to many times you run out of 'power'. It does have pretty good graphics though. I would deffinately reconsider getting Golden Sun instead."
2,Offers little over its SNES counterpart,"This is almost a perfect port of the SNES version of this game that surfaced in the late 80's as a launch title for the SNES/Super Famicom.It gets old quick and tracks all begin to look the same. The ability to do 2-player link off a single cart is the best feature this offers.Mario Kart Advance (also a SNES title) represents a 3rd generation SNES title and was more advanced than FZero in it's day, as a result it's port for the GBA (also a perfect port) is much better than FZero, so if you want a game like this, I would recommend Mario Kart Advance."
5,awesome,"this is a game u dont get tired of esily. its fast and fun. there are 3 difficulty levels : beginner,standard -must beet this to earn a secret character-and expert -also beat this to ern a secret character. There are also three series: pawn,knight,and bishop. Beat those 3 on standard difficulty to earn a secret character. also beat them on expert to ern another secret character. there are 10 racers in all. expert is hard because all the other racers are twice as fast and u r still regular speed, but if u look over this little pain this is a great game. it will keep u occupied 4 a long time and u will never get tired of it. it has multiplayer& u can hook up with other people with just one game-thats cool although there is no music and the game picks u'r racer-but not when everyone has their own game. like i said this is a great game-the graphics are wat u would expect 4 a gameboy but a little better & the music is good :overall its a good game & i highly recommend it ."
4,Not as cool as the first but still awesome.,The first F Zero is just classic cause you can play the first really fast racer of all time its a classic just like Star Fox and Super Mario World.Its almost impossible to resist the temptation to play as anyone other than Captain Falcon.
5,Game Playing Advance,"This is one of the best GBA launch titles out there. Even though it is difficult to play, you get used to it easily. The coolest part is that you only need one game pak to play multiplayer but they all need a GBA. Don't hesitate buying this item. If you put it on a big screen, people would think it's a SNES Game. But puting it on GBA it will make there jaws drop! I hope this reveiw was helpful."
4,Good Racing Game!,"I bought this hoping for the best and it was just about what I thought. It is a very fast paced game, the controls take some practice. Good graphics and descent sound effects. You better excercise your thumb if you dont want to cramp up."
3,In the middle,I don'tlike this game as much as super mario advance because it doesn't let you have powers to shoot your opponents. the graphics are great but I don't like this game that much.
1,F-Zero a speedy failure...,"The first game i bought and it was disapointing.....The grapichs are not very good and the controls aren't very nice to. I think this a funny race game but that's it: 1. it's ugly 2.the controls are weird 3. don't buy, buy another race game like gt advance Championship!"
2,SO SO game,this was my second game i got and its okay its just you run out of fuel too quick and you can only get it back in one place but for all of it to come back you need to just wait there for about 7 secs and thats enough time for the other people to pull in front of you by this game if you like really fast racing games but for me i don't that much i mean the graphics and control are good but the game just goes way! to fast
5,F-zero rules!!!!!!!!!,This game is much better than the 64 version! Its hard but you can work your way up by playing different difficulty levels. A tip for you is use shoulder buttons when you turn and the best part of this game is its cheaper than the rest. this is one game you do not want to miss!
3,"Super game, fantastic graphics, poor turning, few hovercars","This game is sooo cool for several reasons:1.The graphics are cool and exactly the same as the super nes version.2.It's fun to do multiplayer, but you can only do one race with the same vehicles with different colors IF you only have one game cartridge. You probably won't find someone else with the same game though.3. The game is fast, which is exciting in 3-D for GBA.The down part is there are only 4 hovercars to choose from, and only one, the J-B Crystal, has the best turning and speed. It is really frustrating to use all the other cars because none of them are nearly as good as J-b Crystal.Overall, you probably would want this game, but consider what I said."
5,Wingshooter's Guide to Arizona,I would strongly recommend this book to anyone going to AZ to hunt quail. Web Parton does an excellent job in writing this book...he's entertaining as well as informative.
3,an analysis of the popularity of Notre Dame sports,"I read this hoping for an indepth analysis of all facets of the growth of college sports. But Sperber devotes at least half of the book to an analysis of Notre Dame (perhaps because it was easy research - driving from IU to South Bend). Every facet of his ND examples are covered in too much depth while his coverage of the incidents which publicity leads one to believe the book is really about, are cursory at best with little depth in the research behind the topics. I found myself skimming over all the ND examples while reading other topics - an easy one day read over all."
3,Don't rely only on this book,"The Player's guide to the Sabbat is an insightful view into the Sabbat clans, if you own the Revised Masquerade book. Many paths are confusing, and most of the Serpents of Light info was simply left out. This book is useful if you have another $20 to spend."
3,Vampire,Jeff explores a slightly different approach..nice. Technique is just about oil painting perfection. Use of light is much better.
2,Not exactly what I expected,I was disappointed when the mechanic that installed this window regulator told me that the motor was about 1/2 the HP of the part being replaced and that the wiring was reversed (I need to press up for the window to go down and vice versa). The window is now working but at about 1/2 the speed.
5,1 1/2 qt CorningWare French White Dish,"I bought this for my sister-in-law for Christmas. I could not find this item sold alone at any retail stores. It's nice to know you can buy items seperately instead of the sets the stores sell. It was a great price, the shipping was very reasonable and I received it quickly. I will definately buy more products in the future."
3,needs improvement,"I got this dish primarily for heating sides (usually steaming vegetables) in the microwave. It is a nice size, and works well in terms of getting the vegetables cooked and then to the table but has a few problems.First the lid will not stay on! I am moved to write this after it finally bit the dust and shattered all over my kitchen, a day we knew was coming. It simply does not sit well in the lip of the dish. Secondly, when the dish it hot it is really hard to pick it up without burning yourself unless you wrap it in a towel (also keeps the lid from sliding off; pot holders did not give enough control for this). These ""features"" make the dish super inconvenient. You can tell by the fact they offer a warranty on the lids that they must die all the time...I think now that ours broke, I'll be looking for a different replacement."
2,Pahleena,"My hair is so damaged it doesn't hold color very well, but this product was the only one that washed out almost IMMEDIATELY...within the first shampoo...Clairol professional reds last alot longer..."
4,good collection,"In 1998 Tim Murphy's first collection, The Deed of Gift, was published. And it is a brilliant collection. This year Murphy's second collection, Very Far North, has arrived. Murphy still writes mostly short poems with short lines (dimeter and trimeter). And he does it well. He has a tremendous wit, and even more impressive is the seriousness and quality of his verse that you don't normally see in lines and poems this short. Murphy is a regional poet (much like our greatest regional poet, Robert Frost) who speaks of local and global concerns. This collection isn't quite as good as his first (which would be hard to top), and like the first collection it does get a little weaker towards the end, but this is a marvelous work and one I highly recommend."
2,queen in a bar full of breeders,"My Gay Studies' professor, (...) recommended that I read this book. I'll come straight out and say, that I found it somewhat disappointing. There must be a dozen poems in it about dogs, all of which are meticulously rhymed and metered, but all lacking verve and high seriousness.Others deal with bird hunting, and business failures, but only a few have ""gay"" themes, among them a few man-boy poems, which I found very erotic, though somewhat over the top, even for my tastes.I suppose my biggest problem with the poems are their forced rhymes, paddiness of diction, and artificial tone. Murphy never comes off as sincere. He knows his meters, but he sings like a queen in a bar full of breeders.He should write solely for his own kind on topics such as gay pride and gay love."
1,Extreme Amateurism,"This book lacks any sense of musicality and reeks of extreme amateurism, its sentiments are trite and its allusions to boyhood homosexuality are not very subtle, indeed I would say this is the epitome of the state of modern poetry today, JUST PLAIN BAD"
2,"On the heels of Blackhawk Down, this one was a snoozer","If you are aching to understand every acronym the military has to offer, yearning to read through countless missions whose climaxes are putting roofs on buildings, or if you want to know how the military systematically cordoned off city after city in Somalia, then perhaps this book is for you. It details the minutia with which the military deals but there is little in the way of ops or hard-core action if you will. As a writer, Stanton makes a great soldier. This book sets the stage for Blackhawk Down but comparing the two books is akin to comparing a knitting group to a SWAT team."
5,Thank You,My colleagues gave me this book after the sudden death of my 6 year old Murray... for which I am very grateful. Beautiful images.
5,A Touching Book for Anyone Who Loves Dogs,"If you have ever loved and lost a dog this book will touch your heart. Written in such simplicity that a child would easily grasp the concept, yet an adult can hardly ignore the meaning of the book. A beautiful, must have book for any dog owner."
4,Dogs enjoy Heaven,"When my two young friends, boys aged 6 and 10 lost their lifetime friend, Charlie-the beagle, to illnes, I purchased several books to help them formulate their own feelings and perhaps talk about their loss.This book stimulated the most conversation. The idea of 'Charlie' going to a special, dog-friendly, place in Heaven brought a few smiles as they read. This was a good 'read together' book for those under 7 years of age."
5,I keep giving my copy away!,"Cynthia Rylant writes an amazing book that helps people of all ages with the loss of a beloved dog. I gave this book to my 78 year old grandmother who was having a difficult time dealing with the loss of 2 dogs in 3 months. She found parts of it comforting, especially the part about the dogs occasionally returning to their backyards to check-up on their owners. I have read this to children who have lost a dog, and given it to friends. Everyone feels that although it is difficult to read while grieving, something in the text refers to their dog alone. Cynthia Rylant wrote it with their dog in mind."
1,not what I expected!,"There was A LOT of writing and was very personalized inside the book. I was disappointed to see this because the add was not clear how extensive the writing was. For a picture book, I would not buy again."
1,Do you believe?,"I do not believe that dogs/cats/animals go to heaven. I found that this book is somewhat offensive to my religion. I you are a strict person who believes deeply about your religion and you want your kids to be like you do not buy this book. It goes against many things is religion, for instance, their is a separate heaven for animals and that god is watching over them more than the people. I don't like it!"
5,Dog Heaven,I buy this comforting book for all of my friends when they have lost a beloved pet. Children's books are for everybody!
5,I lost my best friend.,"This book is amazing my friend keeps this book in her library for her clients that have to deal with death. Human or dog/pet it helped me deal with the loss of my best friend/dog named Dixie the pom. This is the cutest book ever, it makes my cry with joy. I read it now and then when I start to miss her again."
5,AMAZING!!!!,"My beloved dog Bailey was 12 years old when she passed away just 3 days ago...I ordered this book that day and received it today...I have been crying since Sunday morning, but the tears really flowed when I read this beautiful book. If I could have put into words exactly what I hope heaven is like for my Bailey, this is what I would have said. If she cannot be here with me, I hope & pray that this is where she is right now, eating squirrel-shaped biscuits and sleeping on a cloud...what a comforting story for dog-lovers who have lost their best friend."
4,Great book!,This book is a great way to show someone you care about them when they have lost a dog. I have given copies of this book numerous times.
5,A terrific book for all ages!,"We don't own a dog but my five year old and I just love Dog Heaven. This is a great book to cuddle with a loved one...parent/child, grandparent/grandchild. Even though the content deals with the subject matter of dogs going to heaven it is a great bedtime story. For those readers who've lost a dog it gives you the opportunity to rememeber your pet and some of the cute things that dogs do. Also look into getting the same author's ""Cat Heaven"" another great read."
3,Dog Heaven,"It was sweet, but I had expected and hoped for more. We just lost a dog after over 11 1/2 years and were looking for a book to really help the children cope. It was just alright."
5,"Wonderful book to help all, especially children, deal with loss","Dog HeavenI have ordered copies of this book for friends whose beloved dogs have gone over the rainbow bridge. This is a wonderful and touching book that will be especially helpful to children, but adults love it too."
1,Disappointed,"I was hoping for more, and thought the book had a few questionable/disappointing sections which might actually be more frightening than comforting."
5,This sweet book is comforting and joyful.,I have purchased this book (after it brought me to tears when I discovered it at a school book fair) for at least 6 friends who have lost a beloved dog. Now they are buying it to comfort their friends. It's a treasure! Joanne Turk
3,How do you explain Angel Children?,"I bought this book to help my 4.5 year old grieve for our 17 year old lab who died a couple of weeks ago. The illustrations are beautiful and the tone is soothing; but, I found myself at an uncomfortable loss to explain where the angel children came from--my daughter wanted to know if they were there because they had died too. This is was much more than I thought needed to be explained at this point. Our family is spiritual but not religious and haven't had long discussions with our daughter about God, other than to explain the existence of different religions and the need for understanding and tolerance of all beliefs. Had I known that God was going to be such a centerpiece of the story, I probably would not have purchased the book. I think for the right family, it is a wonderful story. Unfortunately, it didn't work for us.We also read Forever Dog which was recommended by my daughter's school and it was perfect for our needs."
5,Reminding me of Gretchen...,"When I was 6 years old, my German Sheperd, Gretchen died. So at my school library I found this book. I read it with my mom. For weeks I would check out that book, just to remind me of Gretchen. She had been very sick and had a stroke. The doctors could do nothing, but put her to sleep. It was a hard and difficult time for me. But it was nice to think that she was safe and sound in Heaven."
4,Sweet book,We chose this book to help explain the loss of our 17yo dog to our 3yo son. He loves the book and talks about our doggie going to heaven. Hard to read without crying when the loss is recent but it's been an invaluable tool to help our son learn about loss.
5,we should buy these in bulk,we give this book anytime a friend with a dog passes. I think we have probably bought 6+ copies so far. We should stock up to have on hand. This latest made my buddy bawl but he loved it.
5,Mission accomplished,"We ordered this for a friend who had lost her best friend and pet after 15 years. This particular animal had been through making major moves with her and through the death of her husband so while all pets are a big loss, this one hit hard. After receiving this book, she took it home and read it. A couple of days later she sent me a message stating that she can't stop reading it and that it just makes her smile and smile every time she does. Mission accomplished :-). Very heartwarming response to a hard loss."
5,changed my life,"This is an essential book to send to anyone who has lost a dog. Dog heaven is sweet and poignant for adults, and informative for children. I have sent this book to many friends and family and recommend it highly. The companion book ""cat heaven"" is a book that I gave to my neice and nephews when there grandmothers cat Emerson passed away. These are two of the sweetest, best books that deal with gentle dying and death of a pet on such a simple basic level."
5,Rylant's comfort could only be rivaled by our beloved dog,"We were given this book by our vet's office when we made the painful, but necessary decision to euthanise our Buddy. It has been a comfort to both my husband and myself, but especially to our two children, ages 7 and 9. This book is written with everyone's own dog and experiences in mind. And at the same time celebrates the special place in the reader's heart that dog has. A must read for anyone of any age who loses their dog."
4,"Cozy evening with Alison, Spike & friends.","This low-key live recording (11 & 14 December 1994 in Tokyo) exudes a quirky, jazzy pop intimacy that is deservedly back in vogue. Alison Statton (Young Marble Giants, Weekend, Devine & Statton) is front and center in this 14-track set, backed by longtime collaborators Spike, Andrew Moxham and Philip Moxham. Perfect music for Sunday mornings, late nights and rainy days."
5,My fave Sweet Dreams book,"I havent read all the Sweet Dreams books but this one i definitely remember... and thats after 17-18 years has passed since I first read it. i lost the book and now, i want it back!Ms Acosta's review is pretty accurate. i like hate-at-first-sight meetings as well.the chemistry of the characters is explosive, making it a very exciting read althru out. The kind of book that makes you want to fall in love!"
4,Pretty Cool For There Time,When I bought The TAMI SHOW on dvd and saw this group The Barbarians I thought this is kind of weird but the more I watched them they seemed like a rock-Hippy movement band of the sixties and really have there own charm.They actually stand out more that the other acts on the show sometime.With the right Management they could have went alot further.
2,A rare disappointment,"Few actors have such a glowing record of fine films to his credit as Alec Guinness. Here, he is again excellent, but even he was unable to overcome such a weak script. The story involves the Communist tactic of arresting and breaking down a man mentally. The script is pretentious, inconclusive, wordy, and unpersuasive. The production itself is low budget but competent. Hawkins overacts at times, but that's nothing new. One comes away from the film with perplexity and disappointment. Yes, the Cardinal confessed everything. And his inquisitor is apparently ready to commit suicide--for having succeeded. Who cares? There is nothing inspirational or even informative here. It's like an acting school, with two veterans of stage and film displaying their prowess. A film best forgotten."
3,"Good, but not as good as Missing Person's League","This book was enjoyable. The characters didn't excite me as much as The Missing Person's League.Both books have similar themes. In this book, lives have been extended. People get old and bored. They don't have anything to live for. Nor are there resources left for them.A boy who was cryogenically frozen is re-animated because his memory contains the forever formula - a better life extension drug that promises to keep people healthier longer.A group of people don't want this formula released. What will happen?"
5,Joyful silliness!,"My 5-year-old son read this book at a friend's house and truly loved it. He is still talking about it several days later. The book consists of ""dutch door"" pages that allow you to turn the top & bottom independently creating belly-laugh-evoking combinations. This is sure to entertain any preschooler or early reader."
1,A Disappointment,"I suppose it may be helpful for some mothers to simply know that they're not the only moms whose daughters are gay; however, I was disappointed that not one of the essays actually went into exactly why these women were all so initially distraught. Most wrote about how they came to terms with ""the myths and misconceptions,"" but nobody actually says what they are and how they delt with them! Overall, I didn't find this book to be helpful at all."
1,Islam is a religion of love not the one of hate,How can someone profess to be the torch bearer of the believe system which he himself oppose in letter and spirit. We all know that Elijah Muhammad was not advocating to crush the root cause of disease but that of sympton. Islam is a religion of peace it does deamonise a person because of his colour. Rather it is the other way round. Western civilization does have all the signs of decay but the root cause is not the inherent evil nature of its people rather their acts which have made them follow the wrong path. Allah Himself have said repeated in Quran that those who repent will be blessed with his mercy. To understand true Islam one should read Quran the actual and true source of all the knowledge. A book which showed the right path to people like Malcolm X!
2,Not Honeywell,"I purchased this product for the Honeywell name but it is actually ""Plastiflex."" It should not be advertised using the Honeywell brand - very misleading."
4,Sweaters from Camp,Haven't had a chance to read this but flipping through the patterns they are quite stunning. Lots of excellent photos and color choices. A real asset to my book collection.
5,the most beautiful song i'v ever heard,when i firt heard this song i really liked it .he'z cute too.xo
2,Jipped,"It is a good compilation of works; however, if is a ""greatest hits"", then make it one and play the songs that made him the superstar he is........"
5,Long Live Country Music,"I have always been a George Strait fan but what makes this album just a little extra special from his others is his duet, Murder on Music Row, with Alan Jackson. These two guys are out-of-this-world awesome together on this song and the lyrics will chill you to the bone, just knowing that the two greatest traditional country singers had the guts to tell it like it really is. Great stuff on here of course by George also; they just don't make 'em any more country than George or Alan."
3,Contemporary Strait,"George Strait is the finest country singer there is. Most of the songs on here are great -- Adalida, Blue Clear Sky, etc. Some of them, though, seem custom made for today's pop radio -- One Night at A Time, True, etc. That's not saying they're not good; George has an incredible ear for picking a pleasant sounding tune. It's just not the stuff of Amarillo By Morning or Ocean Front Property. We Really Shouldn't Be Doing This does sort of remind me of the raging fiddle of The Fireman, though, albeit not as cool.As for the new tracks, I could take or leave Best Day. It's a nice song with country styling and gives you a nice feeling if you can identify with it I guess, but nothing outstanding. Murder on Music Row is awesome though. It's the truest and most sincere song that's been on the top 40 country radio stations in a while. George and Alan sing it with integrity."
3,Great duet with Alan Jackson,"If for no other reason, this is a good CD because of the duet with Alan Jackson called ""Murder on Music Row."" If you're like me and feel like Nashville systematically snuffed the life out of real country music in the last 10 years, you'll love this song. If you think Shania and Garth are what country music is all about, you won't get the message at all."
5,Worth Every Penny,"I wanted a CD that contained ""The Best Day"" and ""Murder on Music Row"" but I didn't really want to buy the greatest hits. I already own most of the original CDs that these songs come from. But I went ahead and bought it for the 2 new tracks. It was worth every penny. It's great to have all the songs together on one CD. I can sing along to every song on there. I only wish ""Easy Come, Easy Go"" was included. But it's a great buy nonetheless. George Strait remains the King of Country Music."
3,"Fun, but Ball mishaped","We are overall pleased with this toy, however when we blew our ball up- it came up egg shaped and not round. Therefore, it's difficult to get the ball through the hoop and also it hooks when thrown. I would like a new ball sent to me, but cannot find any other form of contact for this particular order. I would appreciate if someone from Amazon could contact us or ship a new ball."
5,So much fun,"I just bought this book last night because it looked very beautiful and interesting. I love Quentin Blake's style and made no mistake in buying it. It's a lot of fun to own, read and work on, I can't keep my hands off it!Drawing can be frustrating but this book, although encouraging, also shows how relaxed and and joyful it can be, never making it tedious. If my nieces were old enough, I'd buy one for each. Can't wait to be done with it so I can move to some of other KLUTZ' works."
5,Fantastic technique!,I love the technique presented by this author. He shows that your drawings don't have to be good to be great! My 10 year old loves it!
5,Had it since early 2000,"And this is still my favorite sketch book. I normally don't like Klutz stuff (except for the juggling one) but for some reason, this really works for me - I'm NOT an artist. It makes me *want* to draw. I didn't realize it was by the same author that does the Ronald Dahl books until just recently."
5,Terrific book,"Terrific book, which I try to keep on hand to give to depressed bed-ridden people. It really seems to help people keep their minds off their worries. I ordered two copies on 1 May and have just cancelled my order on 23 May because the total $100+ order hasn't arrived and nobody at Amazon seems to care. Now I'll have to start all over again from a different seller, because I can't trust Amazon again with an order. Too bad."
3,Great product arrived broken - twice!,I love these casseroles. They are the perfect . My husband broke my 10+ year old set in the same day - this is the replacement product. BUT it was so poorly packaged by Amazon that it arrived broken - twice! So I recommend you purchase it from somewhere else.
3,Satisfied .. product is as advertisedd,"The product is exactly as advertised and was available at a reasonable price. I do miss the ""old"" style of CorningWare that was rectangle in shape, instead of oval."
3,. Please enter a title for your review,"Vaguely pleasant, but lacking hooks, substancial chord progressions, and melodies. It's not drone music it's pop-rock but it just kinda drones. It's not giving me much to get into. Reminds me of early Curve, which is a change from their last album which was somewhat more organic but equally patchy, although it had a couple truly great songs and this album seems to be lacking any. I don't suppose this band will ever make an album that reaches the potential they hinted at during those best moments."
1,Night of The Worst Movie Ever,"Geez Louise. What can I say about this sorry excuse for a movie? I've seen better acting from strung out porn stars. To give any of the ""actors"" a razzy would be insulting to the razzies. They would flub their lines but keep going and the director- if there was one- wouldn't cut. Not that a second take would've been any better if the first was any indication. And by the way, in a movie, a naked annoying chick is just as bad, if not worse, than a fully clothed one. Nudity and fake blood alone does not a good horror movie make."
2,Night of the Idiots,"If you like Bill Zebubs movies, you have a problem to begin with. However this is probably one HIS best movies. But the victims in the story are so idiotic, that I found myself rooting for the Pumpkin man!! Lots of Nudity (Typical Zebub) and some gratuidous violence. Very Poor Special effects. You'll find yourself watching the entire movie not for entertainment, but just to see if it could possibly get any more idiotic and it does. The Special feature commentary by Bill Zebub was better than the movie. It has some funny moments and it's definately campy. It's like watching the old sexploitation films of the 70's at the Drive-in. If you like this type of movie, you'll love this one. If you are plot oriented, don't waste your time with this one. It is what it is...a Typical Bill Zebub flic with a not so typical ending. Pure Idiocy!!"
3,Average,The car itself has a pretty generic body and there's nothing special about building it. If anything some of the parts wouldn't stick or broke easily due to their cheapness. Decals seemed a bit off too because they were off size...one to big another to small...A lot of these mistakes could just be me but this would be my 5th model car. Overall its decent/average and i would rather buy a different model if your not specifically looking for this one.
3,As an experienced hiker I was disappointed,"I recently returned from a trip to the Canadian Rockies with other experienced hikers. We are all in very good shape, but we found the level reviews way off the mark. Hikes rated easy or moderate winded most of us. Hikes rated as 'missable' were at least as impressive as some of the top-rated hikes. While some of the opinions were valid, overall we were all disappointed in the mixed and inaccurate messages."
3,"Nice, but not necessary","I bought this book and ""The Candian Rockies Trail Guide"" in preparation for two weeks for backpacking and dayhiking in the Mountain Parks, from which I just returned.I went on many of the hikes described in the book and found that they mostly coincided with my personal impression, but most of the time I would have been able form that opinion from reading the more factual ""Trail Guide"" description only, together with the respective Gemtrek map, which you will need anyway. So, basically, this is a nice addition to the ""Trail Guide"", which itself is indespensable."
1,Not worth the money,"While this CD does have a number of songs sang by members (or possibly former members) of the listed bands, the renditions are awful (sounded like cover bands doing tribute versions). The singing misses the crispness that the original versions have. If you are a fan of the genre, this CD is not for you."
4,"""HEY JOE"" correction","Contrary to popular belief, The Leaves neither wrote nor performed ""Hey Joe"" first. The band asked Johnny Echols of the band ""LOVE"" for the lyrics to the tune and he gave them the wrong words, which explains their ""version."" Billy Roberts actually wrote the song and the Leaves, upon hearing both The Byrds and Love's live-stage versions at clubs like The Whiskey-a-go-go and Bido Lido's in L.A., grabbed their arrangements and quickly released the track as a single, thus making theirs the ""first original recorded rendition."" The song is almost always accredited to Dino Valenti, but that is also a myth.Great old band, though."
4,hard edged folk rock,"The Review by DJ, just below gets it right. If you like mid sixties rock 'n' roll, and the idea of shaking and stirring the Byrds with the Rolling Stones sounds like a good idea, (and it is), then this is for you.The single version of ""Too Many People"" is a great record, as is ""Hey Joe"", needless to say.DJ is also quite right about their second LP on Capitol.The Leaves were a good but not a great band. If you're looking for a good CD from a mid sixties group and you've got the Beatles, Kinks, Stones, etc. - give The Leaves a try. You won't be sorry."
3,"hummm, hey joe,,,no es para tanto!!!!!!!!","Conocidos por su versión de Hey joe!, intentan desgarrar la típica actitud ""byrds"" con sonido garagero, pero la verdad que no es gran cosa! Sucesión de temas crudos, armónica y folk rabioso, carente de dirección...me quedo mil veces con la versión de Love del tema de dino valente...lo que es excelente como siempre que se trate de sundazed es el booklet y todo lo que es la gráfica del cd. En definitiva no es más que un típico cd ""garage"" sin muchas pretenciones."
4,Oh i wish it was a 96 impala even thought it looks alike,Overall toy is cool. Sucks it never came with actual polish or color and tools to paint her. But for those who do this all the time it wouldnt be a problem to find a paint for this ride.
4,Great for the Price!,"I love this item. I looked at many sd card mp3 players and this seemed to offer what I wanted. It has a fm radio, mic, and plays mp3's. Last a long time on a single battery and plays great.It doesn't seem to be able to bookmark where you left off though. Also it can't skip folders, which I can deal with.Great item overall."
2,errata,"The author is clearly struggling with the materialleading to significant mistakes throughout (e.g.whole numbers are confused with rationals, the fourcolor ""solution"" is muddled, history is garbled--not to mention B.C.E. and A.D. being juxtaposed onthe time line). It's a shame because a diligenteditor could have caught these in time for revision."
5,Das Wilde Leben,"Its a must see, and must have movie. And if you are very resourceful, she is a must have too!!! A very entertaining story, a very strong performance, and a very beautiful Natalia Avelon."
1,What kind of film is this?,"It's a very boring film, boring and slow. I know it should be an artsy, semi-documentary film, but please there should be some good moments in the movie and there are not. DO NOT BUY, this should be a rental if nothing else."
2,Grim and poorly written,"I loved the idea of this book, and the cover was gorgeous. But the actual contents are exceptionally grim and are written in horrible ""poetry,"" each told from the point of view of a child ruminating about his or her gruesome circumstances. The result is writing that is both depressing and static, and the ""stories"" aren't stories at all but the stream-of-consciousness thoughts of a child over the span of about five minutes.Unfortunately, the only attractive picture is the one on the cover, so not even the illustrations can save it.Alternative:Esther's Story by by Diane WolksteinTruly jaw-dropping pictures and a fabulous retelling of the story."
3,Good except for pole,"The clip itself works well. The pole is a normal cheap tent pole, (which has connecting pieces) - which is not strong enough to hold the clip with a rope connected. If you make the pole longer than around 4 feet, it will bend over and will not reach any higher. I'd recommend getting the clip by itself and building your own extendable pole."
5,"Flavorful, stores well, very low sodium","Because this is in a can and not an aseptic box, it stacks better, stores better and lasts longer. It tastes great, mixes beautifully with rice, veggies, makes great gravies and soups. When I was recovering from 3 (!) root canals in one month, I would pop the top of the can (pop-top: another bonus), stick a straw in the can and drink my meals.And when one of my cats was very ill, as part of her recovery, she slurped up her saucers of Campbell's Low Sodium chicken broth, much to her betterment (and my happiness).And last but definitely not least, I've been a Campbell's consumer since I was a little kid - Campbells makes great products."
4,"Solid, Dated Look at World in 1950's","Journalist-Author William L. Shirer wrote this surprisingly accurate look at Europe and the Western World at mid-century point (early 1950's). Readers see Europe as it recovered from devastating conflict (with help from the Marshall Plan), Germany was divided, and the Cold War was reality. Also, the U.S. was the undisputed economic engine, heavily influencing Europe and striving to contain communism. As these pages were being published, the first moves towards the common market (and later European Union) were in effect, and the Warsaw Pact and dearth of European Colonialism were coming. Shirer couldn't see the future, but his analysis was generally on target.This book didn¡t join the author's eyewitness accounts of Nazi Germany on the best-seller list, but Shirer's ability is evident in these pages."
5,Just right,"What I love about this quartet's approach to Beethoven is that it is passionate without being over-sentimental. For instance, there is no excessive vibrato, no ""Oh, see how passionate am I!"". Instead of bringing attention to themselves what comes through is the incredible music of Ludwig Van. Also, as mentioned by others, the recording is similiarly dry : no echo or reverb tricks to muck up the sound or hide intonation slips. This makes each line of the music so much clearer.All in all an atypical performance that is both more ""modern"" than others, including numerous newer sets, and more true to this music.The price listed here is way too high as these are normally bargain disks when sold seperatly. Why is that?"
3,"Nice and very useful, but overpriced.","These binders and their cases are very good to store past year time management records. However, paying almost $10 dollars (near or the retail) for what is simply a specially sized binder and some $10 for the case, is really a bit too much -especially when the material is basically corrugated carton encased in colored paper. Useful, but will look more into moving into electronic records as paying for these every year is a bit too much."
5,Masterpiece,The best version I have heard of one of my all time favorite pieces of music. I listened to this recording practically every day in 1999.
4,Parking Lot lights,"We use this switch at our church to regulate the parking lot lights. The switch went out recently after a storm (maybe lightning - not sure). So this was a replacment. Slightly different than original, but fit in same box made it easier to swap out.Switch is good, but programing is not intuitive. Much prefer to be able to select individual days and set time for each, than 5 day 2 day mode that lots of these switches use.All in all, it works good, so no real complaints."
3,Works OK,Not exactly the product I ordered. This one will allow different time settings but not for different days. The one I ordered was a 7 day 24 hour timer. The one I received is only a 24 hour timer.
5,review of music cd,The product that I received was in perfect condition. There was a double bonus cd included that happily surprised me. The cd did not take long to arrive in the mail at all.
1,Did not get the item shown!,"The model is right, the box was right, the Outback Chair brand was right, and the included directions do say ""C Frame"".However I did NOT get the item pictured, so I uploaded some of my own to share. My chair as assembled was 73"" wide, 60"" deep, and 94"" tall!! I think this frame takes up more space than my car AND IT IS TOO TALL TO FIT INDOORS!!!So now I have $380 worth of scrap steel in my living room since I bought TWO!! ""Return"" shipping on top of the previous shipping charge would make this a ridiculous loss even if I managed to return them.I have no idea how this ""right box/wrong item"" could have happened. Outback Chair doesn't show anything like this on their site. No word back yet from the seller/Amazon on how to correct this situation yet."
1,Doesn't fit a standard trailer!,"This is useless to me because it doesn't fit a standard trailer. (Its actually the same exact diameter as the shaft its supposed to fit on, whereas it should be larger so the shaft can fit into it)"
5,A GIFT FOR A GRANDCHILD,"WEBKINZ IS A WINNER AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, YOU JUST CAN'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM.....KIDS LOVE THEM AND I'M A GRAMMA WHO LOVES TO BUY THEM."
5,Good casserole dish,"It arrived quickly and intact. The lid seems fine although it's not a tight fit it works fine. A very pretty dish, it serves my purposes well. I intend to buy more in different sizes to round out my serving collection. I can't afford a more expensive crockery serving set and the French White Corelle serving dishes are both pretty and inexpensive."
5,caserole dish,"I haven't used it yet, but everything came as advertised. Product was well packaged and came very fast in the mail"
1,Disappointing. Follow up nil.,It was broken in transit. Received email from company much later. I requested another and I have not received any further communication from company. I will never order again from this company.
3,Item defective,"Knob on glass lid askew and obviously must be a second. Sent complaint along with photo to Amazon customer service and have not heard back. Prefer not to return entire casserole, just need replacement lid."
3,Casserole,Purchased to replace a large casserole dish that had handles. I do not like this one as much. It is not as easy to handle without handles.
2,Made in China,I was glad to find this 2 1/2 qt round Casserole on the internet. I live only a few hours from the Corning Factory and wanted to purchase this name brand to help the local economy. I was dissapointed when I took the bowl out of the box and discovered it was made in China! It isn't mentioned on the Website or on the box.It's a pretty good Casserole dish if you don't mind supporting China's economy.
5,I am in love with the entire French White Line...,These are the best casserole dishes. A wonderful friend gave me a set as a wedding present over 5 years ago and I haven't broken even one of these wonderful dishes yet! They clean up easily and are perfect for soufflés or meat casseroles.This one in particular is great for using for a cheese soufflé. Look for the oval dishes for lasagna and dinner casseroles.Dishwasher safe and can be put in the freezer and microwave!What more could you ask for? I am so pleased Amazon started to carry these items and just found them today!~The Rebecca Review2009 - P.S. See comments about changes.
3,Do NOT use on stovetop.,"I also bought this Corningware because the description said ""Durable stoneware material designed for use in oven, microwave, refrigerator, and freezer"". I just assumed that meant on the stove also. It was just the right size, looked nice, and I have other Corningware that IS OK to use on the stove. It broke during the second or third time I had it on the stove. Unfortunately, I had it for a few months and assumed it was not returnable since I read on the bottom, AFTER it broke, that it was not for stove-top use. It would be fine for baking, which I seldom do, but if I can only use it in the microwave or oven it would not serve my purpose."
5,gift for niece,You can always count on Corning. Useful shape with or without cover. Nice to have option of casserole type thing or souffle.
4,Beach Music,"We didn't get to review this cd for you during the summer. Our bad...'cause it is perfect beach music. Sorry, we were at the beach. Instead, you will just have to use this to heat up your winter. Bebel's music is a balm. (We said ""a balm"" not ""the bomb"". We already exhausted our `hip quota' when we said ""Our bad""). Gilberto's honeyed voice, alternately flowing from Portuguese to English, casually rides these gentle melodies and their enchanting arrangements. Marius de Vries, who did such a magnificent job producing Rufus Wainwright's most recent `Want One', employs dramatically more restraint here with similarly brilliant results. The layering of voices, like Enya on `ludes, is an irresistible element, as is the magical blend of instruments-many indigenous to Gilberto's Brazil. Don't be scared off by all the English. There is still enough `oohing', `aahing', and `shush, shush, shush, shushing' to generate a warm summer breeze any time you need one."
4,"Candles, a glass of wine, this CD and the love of your life - a perfect combo!","My husband bought us a copy of this CD some time ago and we play it quite often! The songs are rich, melodic and so lushly sensuous, you can't help but be swept away! This is a perfect CD to listen to while in the tub relaxing, for quiet evenings or as we sometimes do; enjoy while partaking of some spicy Brazillian food!"
3,Stay Wood!,"That cute thought to Pinnochio should be true here. Tanto Tempo is a piece of art work..this new self titled CD is lost in some idea of what they think Joao's descendant should produce. It is not! Buy the first CD and hope the next one will be kinder and gentler. Tom Jobim and Babel's dad could get away with English lyrics but they had rough ""edges"".. she is too polished at the vernacular. Stay Brazilian, Portugese and maybe a little Felicidade! This CD is dull!"
3,"Oh Bebel, English does you no justice!",I was very disappointed to discover that most of the tracks on this new CD were in English. Portuguese is such a beautiful language full of nuance and emotion than cannot be translated into English. This new CD fails to exhibit Bebel's talent--buy her debut CD (Tanto Tempo) instead.
5,It ain't easy...........,"......being the child of a legend, but Bebel Gilberto manages just fine. The daughter of Latin Jazz superstar Joao Gilberto has done quite well making her own fame. A parent's name can, sometimes, be a burden...though, sometimes, it can also provide a key to open the door. Still, once the door is open, the child has to rely on their own talent, not the parent's. Happily, Bebel has all the talent one could ever want.This is a great, thoroughly enjoyable, upbeat album. No point in discussing individual tracks; you'll like them all. Beautiful girl, great music, you'll get hooked in a hurry. Promise.By the way, no connection with Latin legend Astrud Gilberto; she's just Bebel's Dad's ex-wife."
3,English bossa nova,"I agree with several comments regarding Bebel's sweet voice and the musicians working on her CD. The sound is brilliant.Unfortunately I chose to give this CD 3 (and a half) stars because I prefer the English language choices she made in Tanto tempo.""Baby"", the opening track, has a tinge of light sarcasm in it in Portuguese that is essential to the song. It is much more than a love song, and I even ask myself if in Portuguese it was intended to be a love song indeed.This subtility does not translate well into the English version. I find this sad.Happily Aganju is in Porutguese. I feel neither Caetano's nor Carlinhos Brown's lyrics translate well into English !Anyway, thank you Bebel for a cool CD."
1,Only For Beginners Who Have Never Worked Out,"From the reviews of the other Firm videos, I thought this would be a five-star video, too. However, for someone who needs any sort of a challenge, this will be a joke. I kept waiting for a challenging exercise. What I got was more stretching. I couldn't figure out if I bought a yoga video by accident. If you have never worked out before, this video is great start. However, if you are even a beginner, the four exercises they do for abs will not give you any results. At a beginner level, this will bore you."
2,Very dissapointing,"I had high hopes for this kit. My daughter had bought it for me at x-mas so I said why not do it! I usually buy military kits but I love the 69' Charger so I was excited to built this kit. Well I gave up at the interior (step 3). Nothing fits right, inacurate to the real car and just plain bad! Anyone want to buy it cheap?Steve Caldon"
2,Defect model,"i recieved it in perfect condition, but upon assembly i realized that there were no tires! how can there be no tires with a model car, its probably a defect but still, no tires!"
4,"Great purchase but beware, you need glue and paint.",I bought this for my brother's birthday since he loved doing these types of model cars when he was a kid. I was unaware till my husband pointed out that that we needed paint and glue in order for him to be able to put this together. I guess this is a common thing but just wanted to point it out in case someone thought it was a complete kit. I went to Hobby Lobby and another $30 later I had everything he needed to do a great job on this car. Overall happy with this purchase.
3,Pleasant romp through a range of styles,"Some tracks work far better than others on this release. Highlights for me are the title track RHYTHM WITHIN with a fine solo by Mr Faddis on flugelhorn (on FUNKY -T I find his trumpet solo much too piercing), excellent contribution by Mr Sanders and Mr Hancock. TWILIGHT DREAMS is an effective and evocative sound picture of the jungle, whilst AFRICAN SHUFFLE works especially well with a great solo by Mr Lacy. Overall, I found the album pleasant enough and very well orchestrated and performed but nothing much to get excited about."
3,"sturdy, lightweight, uncomfortable for ladies...","It is a simple folding camp stool. As the other reviewers mention, it is lightweight and strong. But it is uncomfortable to sit on if you want to keep your legs closed when you are sitting. Closed legs = cross bar digging into underside of legs. Legs wide open, almost straddling the stool is quite comfortable, but not so lady like. Guys will have no problem with this product I am sure."
4,Very solid 60's pop album,"From beginning to end, Cry Like A Baby, is a top shelf 60's pop album. Alex Chilton had a world weary voice as a teenager and it lends a lot of integrity to songs such as ""Cry Like A Baby"", ""Deep In Kentucky"", and ""Good Morning Dear"". The songs are definitely American and you can hear some of the midwestern St.Louis/Memphis sound coming through, but just under that is a hint of the British Invasion sound that was popular at the time. On more than once occasion you can hear the Beatles influence in the heart of the instrumentation.I recommend this to music lovers who share my affinity for pop music that has intelligence and sensibility."
3,"Interesting, needs more proofreading","I enjoyed sitting and browsing through these volumes. However, when reading about people I already knew much about, I found far more errors than one would normally expect in a published work. E.g., In classical music, they have the number of Symphonies, Quartets, and Cello Concertos written by Shostakovich wrong; they have the number of Hanson's Romantic Symphony wrong, and they imply Tchaikovsky wrote only one Piano Concerto. There are also people I think should be included but are not: Alan Hovhaness, Nicholas Roerich."
5,Must Have Biography Set,Plain and simple this set contains the most up to date biographies and is crammed full of great photographs to boot! Very informative with good bibliographic referencing all at a low price (especially for 17 volumes).
1,"No signal, bad wiring, terrible quality.","When pairing this cable with my Blue microphone and Pro Tools interface, I received no signal. After inspecting both connectors on the cord, I noticed that the wiring leaving the male end of the cable was very loose and quite shoddy. I understand this is a ""value"" cable, but it couldn't keep up in a studio where it would remain untouched. I can only imaging how short it's lifespan would be on stage."
5,great product,"i used to connet 2 speakers to sound at the same time , and it work excellent, i recomend to every one this prodect, great price , tks"
2,It seems like a good idea,"I bought this backpack when I was pregnant with my second child. I rarely used it as a sling backpack because with two kids I found that I didn't have the time to put it over my shoulder. And if, by chance, that I did have the time, the shoulder strap was very uncomfortable. It was constantly rubbing the side of my neck. The other times I just threw it over one shoulder and the problem with that was it always flew down and sometimes hit my 3 year old in the head! This would be good for someone with only one child, otherwise it's too much of a pain to deal with in my opinion."
3,I'm too small for this bag!,"Overall I like this bag. It has just the right amount of room to fit what I need. If it was bigger I think I would throw in more unneccssary things and end up with too heavy of a bag. I don't like that it doesn't have enough seperate compartments. Everything just kind of gets thrown in the big pouch. Second,there is only room for one bottle in the insulated part so I have to carry a seperate cooler. Third, and this is my biggest complaint, it doens't stay on me. I guess my shoulders are too narrow because it always slides right off my shoulder. I like that it goes across my back so i don't have to struggle carrying it and my purse at the same time. It's also easier to carry my daughter with this kind of bag. This is a good bag for short trips or for the father to carry because it's not girly or babyish."
3,"Not the best, but will do the trick","A little uncomfortable to reach inside, and not much space. Best suited for very short trips. But beats the looks of any other bag."
2,"Great Idea, POOR quality","I am a loyal ""baby (california) innovations"" customer. My first diaper bag 2 years ago was by them and I loved it but now that I have two children I needed one that would not slip off my shoulder as most diaper bags do. I purchased this diaper bag because a few other mom friends had and raved about it. I LOVED IT and still do except after 5 days of proper use, the strap completely came apart at the seam. I assumed it was a one time manufacturing malfunction and returned it the next day because I very well couldn't use a broken diaper bag. I received a brand new one and it is happening again!!! The strap is slowly breaking and it has only been 7 days! In addition, as mentioned in another review, the zippers are poor quality and are difficult to close. I do love the design but due to my now double complications with the strap I am not impressed and will be contacting the company as soon as I am done writing this review. Thank you."
3,Great in the beginning,"I initially loved this bag. The style is very comfortable to wear especially when carrying an infant carrier, etc. However, after using it once the lining to the bottle compartment ripped apart! Now, after having it only for only seven weeks, the zipper of the main compartment has ripped too. I can no longer zip it shut. Long story short...great design, but lousy quality. I am going to look for another bag of the same style."
3,great bag but too many pieces broke,Loved the bag at first. Great style and made it so I didnt have to worry about it sliding off my shoulder like the other bags. I have 2 children under 2 years old and needed the space for all of their gear. But the zippers were hard to close and they broke. Also the mesh pouch in the back ripped within the first month.
1,Zipper issues!,"I was so happy when I received this bag at my shower...and was so happy with it for the first two months of use. Then the zipper (for the main compartment) started to be a bit fussy...and now it won't close at all. I'm very dissappointed. The size of the bag was great, and I loved all of the compartments...but it's useless if I can't get the main zipper to stay closed. I was careful not to overload the bag, since I know that overloading can damage the zipper!"
3,Great Bag but the mesh didn't last,I loved the idea of the diaper bag on my back & out of the way. I wish I had this type of bag from day one. My only negative comment would be that the mesh compartment that holds the changing pad started tearing after only a month or so. We really only use it on the weekends so its not as if it was used everyday. That was disappointing.
2,Works Better for the Dad,"My biggest complaint about the bag is aesthetic. Since it crosses the front of your body-shoulder to hip-it really accentuates a breastfeeding mom's breasts in a not so flattering way. Basically is makes them look HUGE. The bag itself is great, and works well for my husband. I'm going to look for a regular bag for myself."
4,Good bag,"Thus far the bag has been quite useful - diapers and wipes in the flat pouch at the bottom, a detachable changing table tucked in the back, and the main middle compartment is big enough to hold a blanket, extra outfit, etc. It is also stylish enough for guys to feel comfortable with. As others have mentioned, our only complaint would be that the zippers can be difficult to open and close."
2,Not enough hands for this bag!,"The opening for this bag is impossible to manage while holding a baby! The zipper is hefty, but stiff and once the bag is open, the opening is sooooooooo narrow! Once I get the changing pad out, I can hardly get it back in when I'm finished. I love the meshy outside and zippered pockets; however, there are no guts to this bag for the baby essentials. Once you have the too large changing pad inside, there isn't much room for diapers, wipes and a wardrobe change - forget about food and toys! Boo hiss. I'm still looking for the perfect diaper bag."
2,Cheap construction; counter-intuitive donning process,"Although the sling design seems ergonomic, it's counterintuitive for me, a right-handed person, to get the bag over my head--it's hard to describe, but it's not a thought-less process. I struggle each time to figure out just how to get it on. Once on, it's comfortable and the cell phone pocket is convenient. On the other hand, once on, you can't really access any other pocket. My biggest complaint is the zippers--crapola. One of them broke after two uses and now it's completely busted. The others catch and seem ready to go at any moment. It seems to me that one could just as easily wear a courier bag slung across the chest."
3,Not bad but has weaknesses,"I loved the style of this bag. I still use it and like it a lot. However, the mesh on the back that holds the changing pad ripped rather quickly in at least 2 places. The only other complaint I have is the zipper for the section on the bottom and the zipper above the pocket on the front. Both are wide-tooth zippers and were pretty difficult to open and/or close using only one hand (which is all you have with a screaming baby in the other arm). If some improvements were made, I wouldn't mind having a bag like this again, but as is, I wouldn't get another one."
3,Only for little use,"We bought this 2 years ago for use with our son, and it lasted about 8 months. The main zipper broke right off, leaving the bag useless.There are many good features of the bag, including the changing pad that pops into a mesh external pocket and has 2 built in ziploc-style dirty-diaper pouches. There is also another dirty-diaper zip pouch inclded, but of these 3 pouches, 2 lost their zip, rendering them useless.The inner pockets and small outer pocket are all good. The best feature of this is that a man can carry it and not feel foolish. You can swing it and put it across your back quickly and one-handed.Due to the nature of the bag, it only holds the basics. That is why I would recommend this bag only for short trips, or specific planned outings where you know you need something portable and can hold what you need. This is -not- your everyday bag. enjoy!"
4,great bag overall,love this bag for everyday use. it doesnt hold enough for a weekend but it holds everything i need for for going out during the day. i like the two external pockets for my wallet/keys and the pocket on the strap for my cell phone. it rides comfortably across my body and is easy to carry when i've also got the baby to hold. i haven't had any wear issues or breakage issues either. i love that it doesn't look like a diaper bag.
4,very pleased,"I like this bag very much. It does hold a lot of stuff, although sometimes if you try to put too much in the bag you have to pack in an organized fashion. It is small on the top so I put something small or squishable on the top in order to utilize all of the availble space. My favorite thing about this bag, that no one has mentioned, is that if I want to get anything out of it I only have to pull it around my body a little to reach the zipper and pull want I need out and then zip it up and spin it back around to my back. If you have a backpack style diaper bag you have to take it all the way off to get into it for anything.The only drawback is that sometimes when I lean over it falls around my body to the front and I have to push it back.One other thing. My changing pad started to smell mildewy right away and I can't seem to get rid of it. Has anyone else had that problem? What do I do about it?"
2,Not Enough Room,"I got this from our registry and had to return it because there was not enough room for all the stuff that babies needs. It also only has one compartment to fit one very small bottle. This would be great for a quick outting to the super market but definitely not good for a long day out with the baby. It also didn't feel as comfortable as what other reviewers wrote about. I'm 5'4"" and about 125 pounds and it just kept slipping to the side and didn't hold still."
2,Terrible Zippers,"This bag had all the features that i was looking for. insulated bottle holder, side pocket big enough for a sippy cup, place for my wallet, keys and cell phone, convenient place for diapers and wipes (easily accessible). This bag was perfect except for the defective zippers. They get stuck and that is really annoying when you are trying to change a baby or do whatever else with one hand and the baby in the other. My grandmother suggested rubbing candle wax on them so that they will slide easier, i tried this trick and they still got stuck so i bought a new bag."
5,I love this bag!,"I think it holds everything I would need (although I do breastfeed and don't have to lug around bottles/formula as well). It is great that you can throw it over your shoulder and go---everything zips in too, so you dont have to worry about things falling out of the bag. And---it doesn't LOOK like a diaper bag---a definite plus for me! (and for my husband!)"
4,Bradley examines the effects of patriarchy on the individual,"Marion Zimmer Bradley uses her fantasy world of Darkover as a backdrop for her close and brilliant analysis of any patriarchal civilization (fantastic or actual) and its affects upon the citizens who live under its sway. The three main female characters each holds and defends a unique position in a culture which forces them to choose in a manner which proves detrimental to the human soul. Her characters are well-drawn, her setting is beautifully creative, and the issues are shockingly relevant to every reader, female or male. With a carefully drawn plot, Ms. Zimmer-Bradley's fantasy novel addresses generation gaps, identity crisis, personal politics, spritual growth, and cultural conflicts which provide distance from and insight into the plight of Terra, circa 20th century."
4,Get chained to reading it!,"The Darkover series is an excellent blend of Science Fiction and Fantasy. Plus, Bradley describes action scenes with a flair that even men could appreciate, while never sacrificing the sensitivity and feeling that marks female writing. You get a good buy with this one."
4,Fun for your Star Wars fan,"My eight yr old gives this two thumbs up. Any little Star Wars fan will love it. Not as educational as I had hoped, would recommend a less expensive used copy."
2,pontiac firbird,how can a Pontiac firebird have a Dodge 440 engine?? in 1968 and 1969 the Firebird had a 400 ci engine or it came with the 455 big block but it never came with a mopar engine
4,Brock 'n' Roll,"There are stacks of live Hawkwind albums out there. Some are the greatest of all time (Space Ritual, 1999 Party)and some are just really good (none are bad, despite dodgy recording quality). This one falls in the really good group. It is a recording of a complete concert from 2001 and the band is ON. The music is in the forefront, with the odd poetry secondary. A bit of improvisation here and there, lots of good and old songs. A perfect blend. The closest album to this is 'Palace Springs' from 1991, which was quite underrated. Highly recommended. These guys are not Dead. Good thing!"
3,From a violist's point of view...,"This CD is by no means ""stellar"". I've heard countless recordings, and I've played both solo parts (preferring the viola, of course). The orchestra is not together in a few places; in particular, the opening section of the first movement where the horns have a couple of notes that are supposed to be played in unison --- and they're not. The viola, as is almost always the case, is under-miked most of the time, and there are at least two places in the solo parts where the viola and violin should be tighter than they are.The recording is OK - but not more. I would buy it if it was on sale, but not at full price. If you want a REAL 5-star performance, pick up the one with Perlman and Zuckerman. It would be hard to argue that it's not the best - because it is."
2,choral music,I was very disappointed in this cd. Particularly when I came to 'How Great Thou Art' and found it was sung to a tune I didn't know. Very disappointed indeed. I don't think I'll risk buying anymore of these cd's.
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"Lame. Oh sure, the first movement is a most welcome addition to Elgar's catalogue, it's a strongly argued piece of music, with a great ""hook"". The rest unfortunately shows Mr. Elgar at his worst. Boring, overlong, discursive, without interesting melodies or rhythms. The recording by Naxos and Paul Daniels is fine, but outside of historical pursuance, and the admittedly wonderful first allegro, it's not a symphony to return to again and again (and I've tried!)."
4,Over in the Meadow,"I have a two year old son and twin girls 10 who all enjoy this story with me (the girls love to read it to their brother). This isn't the version I was looking for, there seem to be quite a few, but we are enjoying it anyway."
5,Another Great Dish From Corningware,"Another great Corningware dish, at a great price, for many culinary purposes. The protrusions on each end, serve well as handles and make this 9"" X 13"" a very safe item to handle when it is hot. Do NOT place the newly designed vented plastic cover on the dish when it comes hot out of the oven, cool the dish first, before covering. This dish has become a regular in my kitchen ... KHS 'The Old Stove'"
2,Average but a little too anti-Catholic,"I'm headed to Rome soon and was looking for a book that would provide some history as well as be a decent guidebook. This book was billed as precisely that. However, I was annoyed that the author seemed to go out of his way to scorn the papacy and almost universally presented the Popes and the Church of Rome in a negative light. As a Catholic, I found this tendency annoying and distracting from the book's true purpose. I wouldn't recommend it as either a history or a guide book."
1,"Awful. Really, really awful!","There's a reason why none of the songs are listed for this album; that's because, other than the title ""Teddy Bears Picnic,"" you probably haven't ever heard of any of them, nor would you want to. But the worst thing about this album isn't the song selection: It is the high, screechy voice of the child vocalist, which is bad enough to make every dog in the neighborhood run in the opposite direction, howling in pain.If you want a charming CD with children's songs, keep looking."
2,"Remember ""No School Today"" on the radio?","Long ago and far away, as a child in the 1950's, I listened on the radio to a children's program on Saturday mornings called ""No School Today."" It was hosted by ""Big Jon and Sparky."" The themesong was ""Teddy Bears' Picnic."" One day Big Jon identified the singer as ""little Ann Stephens."" For many years, off and on, I searched for a recording and some information about the girl who sang the song. A few years ago I finally found this CD at Amazon and bought it. The version of ""Teddy Bears' Picnic"" is to my ears as delightful as when I heard it years ago. It remains one of my favorites. But I can't honestly say that the other tracks on the CD are as charming or enjoyable. I recommend this CD for those who liked the themesong from the old radio program and would like to hear it again. It's also for those like me who are curious about the song artist and want to know more about her and her life."
1,not worth your money!,"You may be thinking ""oh I only need something cheap for anyone who wants to come out climbing for a day"". Seriously, just spend the extra 10 bucks on a decent harness. This one takes forever to figure out and when we finally did get it together, I'm pretty sure it still was not on correctly. It is extremely uncomfortable and is designed in such a way so that the leg straps (which are very long) become the part that goes around your waist. This means that when weight is put on the harness, the legs are constricted very tightly and the waist is left loose. Then when weight is taken back off, you are left with a waist strap that hangs around below your hips. I never actually had any accidents happen, but I definitely think that a harness with a design like this poses serious risks. Youre better off getting a nice black diamond and saving your friends the hassle."
4,Not bad.,I found this cleaner for 25.99 at Walmart. I had to cycle my jewelry a couple times the first time I used it as my earings were really bad. I had to do minimal scrubing but overall I was pleased with the product. I used the gold/diamond mix for added effect. Over all I was pleased with the machine just wish that it was bigger.
1,CHEAP JUNK,This is the cheapest piece of junk I've ever had the pleasure of getting as a gift. My daughter gave me this for Christmas and spent her own money on it and I felt so bad I gave her her money back. Unfortunately we bought it from another online source and the cost to return it isn't worth the hassle. It DOES NOT CLEAN. It loosens dirt .... same effect could be had by just soaking your jewelry in a liquid jewelry cleaner. You still have to manually brush behind stones and in crevices to get your items clean. Waste of cheap plastic. Waste of time. Waste of MONEY !! I don't care how cheap you can buy one of these for .... DON'T !!! If it was at all possible to give it NEGATIVE STARS I would have.
2,Poorly written high-level content.,"In my opinion, this book is really feeding the buzzwords frenzy of Identity management domain . It certainly ""talks the talk"", but can it ""walk the talk""? - Full of google-able content and no meat. I can think of numerous glaring examples where the book falls short. To name a few: SAML (huh? where is SAML 2.0), XACML, Liberty, WS-FederationI think the book does a below average job of providing practical information. Even the content does not flow very smoothly and coherently.I wasted mu money, now this book going to be on my shelf collecting dust."
2,Confusing technology with delivery management,"Though this book covers some basic issues surrounding identity management, the architecture part is very weak. What I felt is that the author is confusing delivery management with the technology itself. Major sections of the book (under the guise of governance) are devoted to people and expectation management and politics rather than technology. Majority of what is discussed is applicable universally to execution of any project in any decent sized organization. Not that this books has nothing to offer on IMA itself - but it is too generic and very little on actual technology."
5,Great Cd!! 5 Stars All the way!,"This Cd is Amazing, Its some good ole christain rock, if you like older school rock you gotta have this cd 5 Stars all the way!!!"
2,Kinda let down...,"This product was sent from Neca so I wasn't too surprised that the quality kind of sucks. They are just two fabric dice hanging on by a thin crappy thread. They are not at all ""fuzzy"" as they claim to be. The dice holes are just iron on pictures of Jack Skellington. Cheap quality, but with Neca, you can't ask for much more. They'll serve the purpose of hanging around the review mirror."
3,Disappointed,"I am personally disappointed with this book for the following reasons:1) Most math books have the answers in the back for nearly all of the odd programs; this book does not. In fact, there's little rhyme or reason for the answers listed in the back. In short, most odd problem answers are not listed yet some of the even answers are given. Go figure..2) I don't care for the chapter and section layouts. In my calculus text, everything is more developed. In some of the better texts, definitions are given before the explanations are given, which in turn precedes the examples given. This book does not of that. There is not a comprehensive list of definitions at the end of the chapter, the in-chapter definitions are weak, and they fail to fully develop the material before jumping into examples, etc.But, it is a textbook and it costs > $100, so by publisher standards, it is a home run."
1,Hands down the WORST Textbook I have ever used!,This book explains NOTHING!! It gives a bunch of examples that do not show the concept or clearly explain it. I have taken Multi-variable calculus and physical chemistry and this book makes statistics impossible. AVOID THIS BOOK!
1,Useless,Way overpriced for a cheap thinly paperback 68 page solutions manual that only further explains what the already given answers in the back of the book. For the high price i expected getting all the solutions and explanations. lazy authors. WASTE OF MY MONEY!! Returning right away.
2,Not worth it,"I couldn't find a review saying whether or not this book had all the answers for all the problems, so I took a chance and got it. Of course, it ended up only having the worked-out solutions to the answered problems in the back of the actual book. Really disappointing, seeing as how most of the problems my teacher assigns are not given solutions in the back, so it's not too much help. Frustrating and not worth it."
2,"Okay, not the best solutions manual.",This solutions manual is horrible. I thought it would all of the answers to the book to help me review for the test but it only shows how to do the ones the textbook gives. Only buy if it you want less than 1/2 the solutions to the textbook.
1,not worth it,This little thing is about 30 pages thick and has solutions to only select problems. I was so upset paying $30 for a few pages that didn't even have the problems or explanations worked out that I returned it right away.
4,Funny Movie,"Max (Til Schweiger) dreams of becoming a great Magician in Vegas. So he blackmails Hugo (Fabrizio Bentivoglio) a gifted pick pocket to become his partner. They enlist the help of a professional(Alan Arkin) to help them get their act together and recruit a waitress (Claire Forlani) to be their assistant.What ensues is a trip to vegas. But on the way they must practice and hone their act in the most unlikely of venues. Misshaps and laughs abound as they draw closer to the ""Holy Grail""....VEGAS!4 Stars. If it wasnt for a somewhat slow drawn out begining I would have given it a 5.This movie is unrated apparently. I would rate it at R for language."
1,highly disappointed,Highly disapointed with this product. First the basteball itself had a small puncture hole. Then the basketball stand itself was cheaply made and the pole kept moving with just a small amount of wind. The hoop kept falling off. We only used it one day and am already going to have to buy another one. I would NOT recommend this product.
5,Excellent Book!,"I have this book and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to have a key reference to using herbal products safely. It is not the only reference book I consult when looking up the safety of herbal products, but it is one of my main ones. I simply wouldn't think of being without it.I congratulate the American Herbal Products Association for publishing this book and being on the forefront of wanting consumers to have access to accurate information about the safety of herbs when looking to purchase Herbal Products."
5,Best CD Storage System,"These boxes are the most efficient way to organize and store a large collection of CD's. I own several of these boxes and I recommend them highly. You can fit a large number of CD's in about 30% of the space you would need if you kept them in their original ""crystal cases"". The only downside is the time you need to spend breaking down the crystal cases and transferring the CD's and booklets to the plastic sleeves that come with this storage system. But once you make that investment of time, you will have much faster & more organized access to your CD's."
5,Excellen Product,If you want to or need to save space and keep your CDs and DVDs in perfect condition there is no better solution....
5,Quality contruction/Great Functionality,After looking at many potential solutions for my disc storage problem I settled on this unit by Fellowes. The case itself is very sturdy and not at all what you would call cheaply made. It was a pleasant surprise. The double sided plastic disc sleeves are ingenious. They include a keyhole type slot on each side for easy disc removal by simply putting your finger in the disc hole and sliding it out of the envelope. GREAT! Also included are adhesive tags to label each sleeve and two hard plastic disc dividers to keep them standing up when the unit isn't filled.I am very pleased with my purchase and plan to buy a few more. Excellent value for the money!
2,Read by someone who doesn't know children,The stories are the basic fairy tales - nothing cutesy or unexpected. But the reader reads very fast and my three-year-old doesn't catch a word. I would recommend Frog and Toad are Friends or Lilly's Big Day over this. Both can be found on Amazon.
1,Childrens stories,"Within 10 minutes of the start of the disk, I heard the word pregnant three times. If I wanted my children to hear this word before age 6 I would have spoken it to them. I put the disk up until they reach the age of 10.Barbara Terry"
5,"Had enough of Britainy, Madona, Jacko and his sister?","I recently discovered an alternative in Sara, Maybelle, and `Doc'. Carter family songs have become an art form from an era when our country and its culture were great. Their music is familiar, simple, direct, down-home and unpretentious without a trace of immorality. Probably not for everybody and certainly a hard-sell to contemporary mainstream America, but I play the Carter Family continuously at work and home.The recordings on this CD are from their latter years, mid-1930's, and are superlative; among their best. The tempo is slower than their first records, and Sara's (lead singer's) natural pitch has dropped to alto; both very suitable to the music.The recording quality wasn't great in 1930, but the `78-record effect', quickly becomes unnoticeable. Sara's got The Voice, and Maybelle, of course, the guitar Style. Pure diamond from southwest Virginia!"
1,dissapointed,"I am very dissapointed after recieving this product, i paid the Fanci-full Haircolor Stain Remover in bottle and paid more than 10 including the shipment.But what i got is 1 pc. towelette after long time waiting.Fanci-Full Haircolor Stain Remover Towelette"
4,Worth more than the price,"I purchased this book because I was looking for some new whirligig plans. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was that and more. The author shows you some good plans, but also gives you enough information to come up with your own designs. If you enjoy making whirligigs and how they work, this book is a good buy"
3,Whirligigs,Not for a complete novice. You need to have the basics of woodworking. The book doesn't explain how to do things - it assumes you know already.
4,JUST RIGHT,It was exactly what I needed and exactly what it was advertised as. I will be using it regularly. Les
2,A poor book with good title,"This book was very attractive to me by its title, so I bought it with a non-low price. However, the contents are neither rich and entensive nor systematic, and the robot systems are not novel at all. So after read it, I found nothing, but waiste of my time, energy and money. The book does really not match its title and price."
1,Rip off!!,This book was a photo copied book from the 50s! It was about 2 pages long and not at all what I expected. Save your money.
3,"Charming, but inconsistent","Red Rubber Ball has some great tracks, including one of my favourite Cyrkle recordings: We Had A Good Thing Goin'. This was an interesting, and for the time, innovative treatment of Neil Sedaka's song. But I am so disappointed my all-time favourite Cyrkle song [the flipside of We Had A Good Thing Goin'] was not included. Two Rooms, which was on the now-unavailable Neon album, is a song of only 1'20"" but it is so sweet and so sad, that I am sorry it was not made available.If you like the music of Lovin' Spoonful, I think you'll love some of these tracks, but there are also quite a few duds."
4,A Good Cyrkle collection,"When this CD first came out I was exstatic. All seven releases (some forget Reading Her Paper, the last one) were lost during moving.The collection fit the bill nicely. It was good to see some tracks on this that were not on the original two albums. To a collector that just wants the releases this is a good buy.Obviously the Sundazed releases include more. This is still a good buy and an enjoyable CD."
3,"Good music, but shame on Sony for the package itself","Way back in 1966, the Cyrkle released an album called Red Rubber Ball. Naturally, when I saw the title of this collection I assumed it was that album now being made available on CD. This disc does have some nice tunes, but I was looking forward to being able to hear the Cyrkle's unique take on Bony Maronie (among other tracks) that was not included in this collection. Shame on Sony for deliberately confusing the issue by giving this collection the same name as the original album.Also, the documentation of the tracks themselves leaves much to be desired. Although having the original catalog numbers is interesting, actual recording and release dates would have been more helpful."
3,An OK Collection,"I knew all the hits, however, the remaining songs were not my cup of tea. The Collection should have been shortened to reflect the pallatable songs."
4,Easy 60's POP,These guys were unique for there sound and had several hits but not consistent with selections...too few good songs to fit there voicing harmonies.
3,Period Piece,"Great album for nostalgia drenched sixties. Not all the tracks stand the test of time, but worth it for those that do."
5,Worth EVERY penny!,"Wow... ""Little Water Song"" is worth the price of this album! I bought PUNISHING KISS only because it has ""Streets of Berlin"" on it (you should hear Mick Jagger's version from the movie BENT), but every track is great. ""Scope J"" is rather cerebral... ""Purple Avenue"" is touching... ""Split"" is full of sarcasm... ""Tango Ballad"" (from THE THREEPENNY OPERA) is funny and witty... BUT... ""Little Water Song"" takes the cake: it is at once sad and beautiful... the orchestral background compliments the lyrics perfectly. Buy this album. Buy the London cast recording of CHICAGO. Buy ANYTHING that boasts the many talents of this remarkable woman!"
3,Pop goes the Ute,"Perfectly reasonable cd, but for those of us who just love her German cabaret, this may disappoint."
5,SEE HER LIVE!,"I just saw her on Friday night, and she completely floored the whole audience! I'm so glad I bought this cd before I went to see her, I was able to appreciate the songs a lot more. She has a tremendous love for her audience, and it comes through with her every breath. There just isn't anybody else like her, anywhere. Kudos to Nick Cave ant Tom Waits, some of my favorite songwriters."
2,A disappointment,"I am going to go against the prevailing trend here and describe this album as a disappointing foray into contemporary music. I have long been a fan of Ms Lemper's singing, but detached from the in-built drama of Weill, Brecht and the Chanson transition she sounds adrift, uncertain and bland - as if she's not sure what the lyrics even mean. She brings nothing new to Waits' ""Purple Avenue,"" one of my favourites. In fact, it sounds a little lazy and lacking in subtlety."
5,Saw this Album LIVE,"Saw Ute live last night at Royce Hall in Los Angeles, she did all the selections from Punishing Kiss...they all are written especially for her by the international and ecclectic group of writers...theses songs really take you away, enveloped in the meaning, emotion and the power of her voice...a must buy"
2,Left me cold,Not up to the level of earlier works. At about the 3/4 of the way in flipped to the end to confirm suspicion and gratefully ended the effort. Characters could not hold our interest and the mystery was TV grade.
2,Overweight...needs an editor,"I dunno, I am always suspicious when people gush endlessly about how great an author is...then tell me that the book I read was not his best...even though everyone gives it 4 or 5 stars.This book just became more and more complicated with individual plot threads added on every 30 pages or so. Half way through, I was expecting some kind of advance in the plot, but then he adds a whole drug sub-plot in Tijuana...I just didn't care anymore.The author is no James Ellroy, where the plot becomes a web of complexity and everything is eventually related....nope, this is more a two-lane highway, that becomes, 6-lane, then 8, then 16...and after a while you just lose track.On the positive side, his writing is good and the characters were interesting...I just wish he could have provided one solid plot instead of enough plots and background for 4 novels."
2,The usual SoCal fare,"Typical southern Calif. murder procedural. Wealthy powerful man is murdered. Who stood to benefit, who to lose.... How is his big pie gonna be sliced.Parker, T. Jefferson writes better than most but it's still a typical southern Calif. murder procedural. Wealthy powerful man is murdered.........Also the ending was insanely irresponsible. I mean the shoot out at the Mex/Cal border. I don't think the real cops etc. would have done it that way. Or at least I hope not! They, I hope!, would of waited until the beach transfer then made their move, having filmed the whole trip along the way, making for a nice neat wrap up.I recommend Newton Thornburg's 'To Die in California'"
2,Boring!!!!,"Although I tried mightily, I could not get interested in this book. Storyline was not exciting and it moved at a snails pace!"
3,Not so scary,"I do believe that this story might be just a little scary, but it isn't the scariest I've ever read. I mean, if this story happen to someone, it could be scary, sure. But as a book, I was actually pretty much laughing at the beginning. So I am willing to buy the next two volumes of this book. But unfortunately, I cannot find any site that I can order the next two in. I think I have found the third volume, but not the second."
1,"R.L. Stine, the master of horror?!?!","Dont make me laugh. If this (...) scares you, then you must be scared by Barney and Mr. Rogers! Stephen King is the TRUE master of horror, and unlike Stine, can write more than Horror."
3,"Great architect, disappointing presentation","It is wonderful to see a book devoted to the houses that John Lautner designed. However, the small format (8.2 x 6.5) doesn't do justice to the details of his designs."
4,Decent Product,Bought this as a gift to replace a similar flag that had worn out. The recipient was very happy with it.
2,Ditto other reviews!,"I am so grateful for the first review. I had no idea I had ordered the African-American doll! And thankfully, I caught it based on that review.Actually, I thought she was prettier than the blonde, but when I looked at the close-up pictures, I did see her features. I will have to return her, but I have ordered the blonde one, and I do have time to get it before Christmas. As others have said BE CAREFUL!"
4,",","So punchy it'll break a rib.As a collection of short stories some are better than others but unlike other books, none left me wanting. The added charm is that each story takes about the same amount of time to read that a healthy bowel movement takes to drop so it's perfect for le toilette."
4,Great intro for non-bizarro readers!,"An action packed punched to the gut. Alyssa really embodies the phrase, ""All Killer and No Filler"" in this collection of stories. I mean seriously how many people do you know, or authors, can cram 24 little vignettes/stories into 1 book under 100 pages? ONE - Alyssa Sturgill.A great little amalgamation of great stories you can read during any short breaks of your day. Standouts to me being: No.5 Simian Place, Beware of Kittens, Love Samurai, We Twins, etc. But they were all great, not a dud in the mix. There was funny, BIZARRE, gross, poetic, sleazy, and so much more.Great little snippets and glimpses into the authors bizarro mind, a great introduction to the genre for non-bizarro readers. 4.5 Stars!"
4,Quite a surprising album,I bought this in a sale in Tower Records ( 5 ) and when I first listened to it I thought it was diabolical. Half the tracks were horrible and half were really weird. I promptly didn't play this for a long time and it was only a couple of weeks ago I played this again and surprisingly enough it really gelled as an album on a whole. It's got some good things going. It can be irritating sometimes but generally the album's a pleasure to listen to. Pity that this album got turned up on first release but then on first listen I could understand why. A surprising rare treasure that should be enjoyed
1,This item is a piece of trash,"The Royal PF110 picture keychain manual provided is one of the worst I have seen since the Apple II computer arrived upon the scene 30 some odd years ago. Every word & phrase is in English, but the meaning is in Chinese. The software provided will not run on Windows Vista. After talking to technical support I downloaded the Vista Upgrade software. The upgrade software is worse than that provided on the CD. All I can say is that the device does charge the battery & turns on & off. Other than that I have no experience because the device does not operate with the software provided. I am going to trash the device & go do something more pleasant."
1,Quick crash,"I purchased one of these as a Christmas ornament. I do have a PC not a mac but before I could use it the thing crashed, I cannot even reformat it. If you do get one make sure you are getting it cheap. Good luck.Daryl Stewart"
2,Not bad,"It's a clever and fun idea, but unless you carry a magnifying glass, the pictures are pretty hard to see. It's a cute little gizmo for a reasonable price."
3,Cycling World Tour from 20 Years in the Past,"I liked this book. The author and three partners tackled the World Tour for Hope (medical charity organization) back in the early '80s. Although it's a fairly brief account of the 380-day bicycle expedition, he does give you a good picture of the poverty and extreme living conditions in Africa and Asia, and some insight into the tribulations of riding a bike for that long. I got a kick out of the problems they dealt with that would probably not be the case today with cel phones & laptop PCs. The whirlwind wrap-up of the San Francisco-to-D.C. leg of the trip was a bit of a letdown, but all in all an enjoyable story."
5,A+ Story,"My 3yr old daughter and I enjoyed the story line as well as the vivid colors. It is difficult to keep her interested but this book does the trick. Some words in the book have to be explained but the growing mind of a child has nothing but to prosper from this. Keep them coming Jean, Thank you."
5,Great for camping,"I received this as a xmas gift from my husband, and I absolutely love it. We are frequent campers, and until this stove I have used a hand-me-down from my in-laws that must be at least 20 years old. Cooking on this stove makes me feel like I am at home, in my kitchen. The cooking space is much larger than most, and the flame seems more adjustable than others (not just HI or LO heat). The push-start is A MUST. I highly recommend this stove for any outdoor cooking use."
5,Watch for the best price,This is a great product and you'll enjoy it even more if you wait for the price to drop to Amazon's August 2008 price of $39.25.
3,review of recent purchase of privacy screen,Quite satisfied however would have preferred a blackout type of privacy screen vs blurred screem image.
4,Use it on sunny days,Use this on my camcorder and makes the skies more saturated while bringing back details. Its definitely a high quality filter and I own alot of b+w products due to their reputation. I like also the fact that you could rotate the ring that it changes the amount of blue sky and contrast. I had one without the ring and that was from b+w and that I didn't like at all.
4,Fine farewell from the Box Tops,"A strong r&b/pop farewell album from the Box Tops. Good songs and performances all around. The bonus tracks are a nice addition, too. Well recommended for fans of Box Tops and Big Star/Alex Chilton."
5,Idiots DeLuxe!,"Here we see the Stooges in jail for suspicion of murder. Three beautiful women meet them and propose marriage. The Stooges are about to be executed but are freed after the real murderer(s) confessed. Moe is court,being tried for mayhem. Curly with Larry alongside him in the audience,shouts to the judge,""You mean murder!"" Moe is acquitted and continues with the behavior that brought him into the courtroom. The Stooges even find a bonanza which is stolen money(the crooks buried it underground). The Stooges become artists and later go to war with wet clay! Also a beautiful girl named Nell promises to marry Curly,a newly appointed sheriff,if he saved her father's life and bring Blackie,an armed villain,to justice. In POP GOES THE EASEL,the artist film,the real-life daughters of Moe Howard and Larry Fine,then small children,appear in the scene where they play hopscotch and they both chuckle when their dads and Curly play. A must for all Three Stooges fans."
1,The text was corrupted,I bought the Kindle edition of this title. The text was corrupted and was nearly impossible to read. At times I was able to decipher what the words were supposed to be by the context of the sentence but other times I had no clue. I would advise others to stay away from the Kindle edition and purchase the printed version instead at least until Amazon corrects the problem.
2,Why not just ....,....skip these bootlegs andbuy the crystal clear versionsof your favorite Shaw Brothers moviesfrom IVL/Celestial.
4,Networking A Scanner,"The Visioneer NetScan 2000 worked just as it was supposed to work. The Documate 632 (office scanner) should have come with a network card in it but the manufacturer decided that an ""office scanner"" didn't need a network card. STUPID !!!! The Visioneer NetScan 2000 solved the problem nicely."
2,Disappearing act,"The top disappeared withing 10 minutes of me putting it in. The belly ring is still cute, but now worthless"
2,"One broken, otherwise okay.","When they arrived I could hear that one or more were broken inside, and I was very right. One is broken and one is cracked down the bottom. I called Amazon and sure, they were nice, but this isn't the first time I've recieved a broken item from them.I am currently waiting for the 12-piece corningware set and I am pretty uneasy about receiving them. Hope they're not all broken too.Other than the fact that they're broken, the two that are still whole are quite nice. Smaller than I thought, but they tell you how big they are so I should have expected it."
5,"great for child's ""heat up"" foods at daycare","Our child's daycare doesn't want ""glass"" dishes, and we're not crazy about microwaving plastic containers. These CorningWare dishes are great!"
5,Super cute ramekins,"Prices are satistfying compared to other shops, and they are so lightand cute!I love it :)"
5,Curse of the Narrows: The Halifax Disaster of 1917,"This book was a very detailed, thoroughly researched account of the Halifax explosion in 1917. A great read - I felt I knew many of the people and learned a great deal about disaster recovery and the will of people to survive."
5,"The ""September 11"" of the 1900's","This is an account of what resulted when a ship, heavily-laden with explosives for the WWI war effort, collides with another ship in Halifax harbor. It is a gripping moment-by-moment story of people in the town and on the ships as they react to the moments leading up to the explosion (which would be unrivaled in size until Hiroshima) and the recovery efforts that begin after. Individual survivors must recover and scramble to save themselves and others, doing the best they can, while a long-distance relief train, filled with medical workers, is sent from Boston. In the meantime, we continue to see the ongoing experience of the survivors ""making do"" as a blizzard bears down on the stricken city.I thought this whole story was very fascinating, and reminded me strongly of 9/11. Only in this account, modern advances in technology, medicine, and communications are absent."
3,Good B&W Guide,Good practical guide with excellent black and white photos. If you want color you need something else.
1,Trees of Texas: An Easy Guideto Leaf ID,W E L L- It would be real good if I could get it. I have yet to receive it.As your note showed it was ordered a month ago and I had forgotten about theorder. Now I want the book or credit to my credit card. Now it is next to impossibe to get in contact w/ Amazon. I actually bought two of the same book.One for me and the other for gift....Oh. well.
4,Easy and fun,"I built this model in about a day. It only had three pages of instructions, and was quite easy to build. With a little custom painting, it is still a beautiful finished product."
5,Hemi Cuda,I got this for my son-in-law for Christmas. I was very happy when it got here in time. He loves it and can not wait to put it together. I would buy from this seller again.
3,Nice but not the right price,"I like this model and was hoping to get a better price than local hobby store. Unfortunately, they carry it at same price so I will probably buy from them. Wish I could rank it higher but as I do not own the kit yet I would just be making up a response."
3,"Good, yes, Efficient, No",It seems this ink doesnt last longer than the ink of my previous printer.I like my printer though because it has miltiple functions...printing can be expensive though
1,HTC HSS-10 Heavy Duty Adjustable Roller Stand,"HTC HSS-10 Heavy Duty Adjustable 26-Inch to 43-Inch Tall Roller Stand with 16-Inch Roller:This is a run-of-the-mill stand that lacks a fine adjustment that would make life in the shop so much easier. I thought the turn handle was a fine adjustment, but it's just a lock release. The four leg pedestal is hard to store as the legs are not movable. This is a disappointing purchase, and there are better brands available."
3,Inexpensive and attractive but ...,"My experience with my remote is that it must be reprogrammed on a regular basis. Read: often. It ""forgets"" that it is programmed and we have to go through the very tedious process of resetting it. Daily. Also, we paid $9.99 for this model at Target -- that's quite a markup! The positive points are that it does work when it is set (and remembers); it is inexpensive; and the backlighting is a very nice feature. Perhaps we just picked up a defective one ...."
4,"Good cases, nice layout but slanted towards SBM positively.",The cases are very good & a nice change of pace from the usual dry textbook reading. The color layout helps direct the reader towards points of interest and it is broken up into sections that are extremely readable. There is a definite slant toward the positive side of Small Business entrepreneuralship-not much is mentioned on the negative aspects.
3,SBM: Book,"This book was decent. It was a very easy read but almost to the point where the information being 'taught' is common sense for most people. If you are looking for an idiots guide to business management, here you go. It was somewhat helpful. For the price though(around $2 for me), why wouldn't you purchase it? Makes for great, cheap kindling now that winter is here."
5,Good Book,"Bought it used, it was such a steal. It came within a week and was just as it was advertised. Very satisfied."
2,No CD rom included,"I am giving this a fair rating because the book came with no CD rom. The seller did not include this in the product details.It would have been helpful to know that. Therefore, it was misleading information that I was given. I am highly disappointed."
4,Delicious,"The price was tariffic and the product tasts great. What more could I ask?Oh yes, the shipping was free."
2,Incredibly Deceptive,"This CD case only has sleeves to accommodate 24 discs, NOT 48. The build quality is alright, but if you're looking to hold more than 24 you should probably look elsewhere."
3,Chorus is excellent,"If you can somehow get used to the lacklustre sound quality, this is an excellent performance, particularly the choral parts. The chorus has a fresh sound and they sing with much attention to detail and dynamics. The playing and conducting are all vintage Ormandy/Philadelphians, but the snag is the sound. The sound doesn't jump out at you like some of the more modern, digital versions. Then again, this is at budget price. A full price option with spectacular sound and a fine performance is the San Francisco Symphony led by Blomstedt on Decca."
3,good wrist rest,"I liked this wrist rest.its durable , comfortable, and long lasting. the only 2 problems I had with it is it covers up the lights and/or switches/ ports of certain models, and the shipping is pretty expensive( alot more than the product itself) which kind of fools you if you are not careful. still. i recommend it for anyone with carpal tunnel and owning a laptop (FYI it may be a little too big for netbook owners)"
3,It's ok...,"This is ok. I was looking for a wrist rest that would fit over my laptop because of how the keyboard is set back. This fits and is made of flexible plastic, so that's good. The part where you put your wrists is pretty hard, not all that comfortable. And I have to consciously make an effort to position my hands in such a way that the base of my palm is sitting on it, rather than my wrist. (It doesn't naturally guide your hands into the right position or anything like that.) But that position is more comfortable with this product than without it."
3,It's OK.,My laptop is one of the larger ones with a 17 inch screen so it does not work very well with it. ALthough I think if my laptop was smaller it would work better.
4,Good for ThinkpadR61,I have a Thinkpad R61 and the wrist rest fits quite fine. The shape with sharp angles of the Thinkpad can be uncomfortable if you work with your laptop all day. After some time I started feeling pain on my wrists and lower arm. The wrist arm helped to alleviate the pain and the effects could be felt after a couple of weeks. It also acts as a reminder for keeping the wrists in a better position while working.
5,Love this toy,My daughter received as a gift and loves it. She has had it for a week and has not put it down. I love the fact that Barbie's ballet shoes are painted on and I do not have to put them on every 5 minutes. You can position barbie in many dance poses. Kelly is very cute. My daughter pretends Barbie is the dance teacher and Kelly is the student. I would recommend to any barbie fan who loves to dance.
4,A Role-Play Specific Doll - Great for the Ballerina Baby Girl,"This was another Christmas gift for our 3-year-old daughter, who began taking ballet lessons this past fall. She was very specific about the Barbie she wanted, and it was this one.The Barbie is very articulated (knee and foot positions) which is probably better enjoyed by the older ballet and Barbie fan. Our daughter is younger and has more fun with Kelly spinning to the music, and the fact that one can hold Barbie by the crown on top and spin her as well. The ballet barre and bag haven't caught her eye; it's the dancing Kelly. Because the ballet shoes are molded onto both dolls' legs, these cannot be dressed up like other Barbie and Kelly dolls. These two beautiful dolls are specific to the ballet role-play."
2,Fit is great but quality is poor.,"Read my review about the passenger side mirror Dorman product number 51622.This mirror fits perfectly as it should into the plastic base that they old mirror was removed from. However, the edges of the mirror backing film have come up or are rubbed off in a few places which almost makes the glass looked chipped.[...]The mirror is glued to a piece of cardboard when it arrives and needs to be heated before the adhesive will let loose.Dorman customer service (the one time I have ever needed to contact them) was horrible."
1,"Returned, not as expected. Shipping not refunded to or from.",It was bigger than I expected and therefore not what I wanted. Return took some time to process and none of the shipping (original or return) was refunded.
5,Awsome,This totally rocks! i just cant wait until they make a movie out of this now. its great how they kept the spirit and changed the story line
2,Interesting but ultimately empty,"The Legend of Korra was an interesting attempt to continue the Real Avatar World. They introduced Korra as the new Avatar in training. She was not well presented initially but as the story went on she got better. She was sadly outdone by the great characters that they put around her, at least until the last episode. It would have been nicer though if they had continued the story with Prince Zuko descendants so that we could have finally learned what happened to his mother. By the last episode you're looking for this story to finally pick up steam but instead it ends with a thump. Too bad for Korra and the Avatar world."
3,This may be the start of the series going down the hill!,"This episode was not the best,the romance seemed rushed. In the first avatar, it took about three seasons to get to kissing, and admitting feelings of love for each other. But this happened in just the fifth episode! I hope the next episode is better!This is the only TV show I watch, because there are a bunch of other crude, crass, ugly TV shows in the world. And number two, I am GETTING SICK of every one in the world getting so obsessed of the new series my little pony! I hate now because people treat it like a god, and even guys like it! which they proudly call them self's Bronys.OK, back to the subject! Overall, the legend of korra series is really spectacular, no wonder it took nickelodeon three years to plan and make it. And I think it is better than the first Avatar series."
1,Disappointing.,"Absolutely atrocious video quality when viewing from a downloaded HD file. Jaggies everywhere. Not to mention the terrible system Amazon has in place for their instant video. No simple way to download and play where ever I want to like with AmazonMP3. Oh no no no. You have to download an entirely different program, and are unable to watch your videos outside of this program. These sorts of things should be prominently stated on the page, not buried in help links and terms of service.At least I only bought the first episode instead of wasting money on the whole season. Amazon, you will NOT be getting my business in the future."
5,"best show, great continuation from the original avatar","Great show! for all ages.me and my family enjoy it, and being able to stream it from amazon! even better great quality and no streaming lag that you get from other services, amazon video rocks!"
5,so far a great sequel.,we loved the original avatar the last airbender and we were excited to see a sequel. we don't have cable and being able to watch on our PS3 through neflix i just wonderful.
5,Pretty good,"It takes awhile to get going, but a good continuation of tha Avatar universe. The 1920's theme is cool, upgraded animation and excellent score. Definatly thematically different than Avatar, but still amazing."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"Beautiful animation doesn't make up for poor characterization and disappointing plot. The first few episodes are amazing, but sadly, it doesn't live up to its promise, rushes far too quickly to make any of the romance or plot believable or engaging, and ultimately just left me disappointed with the whole season."
4,Avatar the next gen,Mostly a rehash or the originals characters but still a great series. Story line is more unique and they introduce bender sports! Worth a watch if you liked the original!
5,Fantastic,"I totally fell in love with this show. Gorgeous animation, beautiful music, great action sequences and characters I also fell in love with hard and fast. Totally amazing follow up to Airbender--can't wait for more!"
5,my love for bolin!!,Yes I do agree that the episode felt rushed though I do admit that this episode was one of the most entertaining....My favorite character Bolin practically stole the show in this episode. Overall I found the episode funny and so 5 STARS FOR ME
3,GREAT SERIES but DVD HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED!,Since the DVD Set has not come out yet. I was just curious to see how many episodes will be included on it. Will there be special features commentary by the creators.By the way I love the original Avatar: The Last Airbender not to be confused with life action movie.What I don't get is why people are reviewing a DVD set that has not come out yet?Wait until is is available and then write reviews....!!!
3,"Disappointing follow up to ""The Last Airbender""","Loved the original series and downloaded this but was disappointed to find that the writers seemed to rewrite the original again. Interesting storyline, but it was rushed. Disliked the ending and lack of character growth. Animation was smooth and beautiful, good voice acting."
5,Great series,"The Legend of Korra is a visually stunning series. The script and dialogue has its missteps, but as a whole, it is compelling and draws the viewer in. The main drawback is that the story feels rushed, to fit in the 12 episodes. A true treat for Avatar: The Last Airbender fans, and those unfamiliar with that previous series."
2,Shyamalan bested!,Shyamalan was at some point being credited with murdering this franchise. Looks like that honor may actually belong to the Korra series. This story line is popular because it is still better than the other c*** that passes off as entertainment.
3,"Not bad, but Amazon video services.","The Legend of Korra begins after Avatar Ang has passed. It has moments where you see the wit and charm of the original series, but let's be honest the first series is a tough act to follow. It is better than the live action movie... rofl.With all that said, it needs to be stated that the Amazon video service is absolutely terrible, and if you can get it via another mechanism, I would recommend doing so. :("
4,Not as good as Aang- could be better with a little,Could be better with a little more development of the story line with a little more depth. Lack of new stories leaves you hanging.
4,this was awesome!!!,This new series of Korra was awesome! Even my 6 year old daughter loved it! Almost at the end was when it was getting suspenseful! I thought that everything was over for Korra and that a new Avatar would have to be born but whoa to my surprise all turned out well!! Great job! Hope to see more Avatar series but make it last a little longer like the first Avatar series that had a few shows for each element.
4,Pretty Good,"It isn't as good as the previous series (so far). Definitely still worthy of never missing an episode! For having ""mastered"" three elements, she doesn't seem as capable as you'd expect. I understand her skill will develop throughout the seasons, but it's left a little to be desired (probably on purpose). The characters are good, but the main characters are older than last season. The more modern city atmosphere, as opposed to for example, the Ba Sing Se city of last season, is kind of boring, seeing as every action cartoon takes place in a city. I'm sure things will change and pick up. Like I said, it is still very worthy - but so mare mostly because of the nastalgia of last season popping up here and there."
3,The Legend of Korra,"For fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender this series is not a worthy successor. The setting is more contemporary, darker, grittier, and less interesting than Airbender. The characters are more shallow, less lovable, and infinitely less fun. No transport to a different world here. It's all too depressingly familiar. Alas, the sequel is again so much less than the original."
5,"A recommended ""how-to"" primer, reference, and resource guide","Authoritatively written by Eric Gagon (President of GAA, a successful marketing, product development, and professional development consulting firm), The Marketing Manager's Handbook presents practical and proven marketing techniques for business-to-business, trade, industrial, and high technology markets. Step-by-step guidelines, extensive examples and illustrations, warnings of common pitfalls, and more, fill the pages of this exhaustive and very highly recommended ""how-to"" primer, reference, and resource guide for anyone charged with sales and marketing managerial duties and responsibilities for operation ranging from a small localized operation right up to an international conglomerate."
5,The Gift recipient is happy with the sconce.,The Gift recipient is happy with the sconce. The Gift recipient is happy with the sconce. The Gift recipient is happy with the sconce.
3,"Pretty, but...","I don't have the round ones, but I have the 2.5 and 1.5 oval ones. Ok, they're corningware, so you'll know they work great, but if I was buying them again, I'd find ones with handles. When you have 2.5 quarts of casserole, that's a heavy dish. Now try to pick it up out of the oven when it has no handles! It's difficult and awkward. On the other hand, they do look great sitting on the table."
1,Not the real McCoy,"When I ordered this, I thought it was CorningWare. NOT. It is stoneware. A world of difference...stoneware is heavier and susceptible to temperature shock breakage. This may be made by ""CorningWare"" but it is not the original CorningWare ceramic; which, it turns out, is no longer available. The casserole is a nice size, but not the real McCoy."
5,for every household,Every household should have this oval casserole dish. It comes in handy so very often. It makes a great Shower or Wedding gift. The couple will have this dish to use even after 25 years plus of marriage.
1,Not up to corning standard,This product was smaller than I had antisipated and the lid doesn't fit as securely as other's I have. One thing I don't like about it is there are no type of handles and makes it very difficult and dangerous when removing from the oven when it is extremely hot.
1,Corningware 2-1/2 Qt dish,"The dish was packaged in tons of bubble wrap so I was so disappointing when I got all of the wrapping off and noticed the small chip in the lid. The lid was the most important, I already had the dish but needed a new lid after a friend dropped mine on cement at an outdoor party. I did not make the attempt to repack and send back. I hope the crack doesn't worsen."
2,Great Music - Poor Quality,"The Number Twelve Looks Like You was in incredible band with a lot of intensity and energy. The audio CD was very poor quality and a real let down. Their live DVD that accompanies the album shows the band as quite a crazy bunch of dudes on stage and mellow and intelligent musicians off it. Overall, a real let down from a great band."
5,"So, where do the rails go?","I very much looked forward to getting this product as I love to explore coal towns in Southern WV. HOWEVER, I knew jack squat about the rails. This book has changed that and will help me in my reaecrh efforts further. NOTE: READ the KEY before looking at the maps within the Atlas. Sounds like a novice suggestion, but its literally the real way to learn more about where you go"
4,It is a very good product,Tussy Cream Deodorant is hard to find at stores in this area of Arizona and glad this area had it.
4,Oldie but goodie!,Have used for years but find it more & more difficult to find in the local stores. Thank heavens for Amazon.
1,The lot was garbage.,The lot I received of this item ( Tussy ) was complete garbage. It was not as I remember It to be. Save your hard earned cash.
3,Tussy Cream Deodorant Fresh Spice,"Doesn't hole as well as it use to, and it makes you itch under you arms. The regular Tussy was much better. Please go back to the original ingratiates for this deodorant."
5,Recommended by SONY,"By using this double-sided miniDVD media, I save space for it case. Just need one case instead two. Usually Sony DVDcam showing warning if it detect DVD media unless SONY product. I have try Verbatim's, Memorex's, Melody's, that the message always shown-up. With this JVC products, the message never appear as like SONY DVD media."
3,O.K product,"i bought 2 . first one gave reading error after recording about 10 times, the other still ok."
2,had a problem,in that the disc only recorded on both sides for a short time. an error message appeared that the second said could not be use to record after about 4 or 5 uses.
3,cannot play on XBOX or other DVD players,I am disappointed that XBOX 360 or other DVD players cannot read the video clips I took. I have a Sony Handycam DCR-DVD 403.
1,DVD RW,I HAD VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THE PRODUCT.1) I was not supplied what they advertised.2) The single item the one I received was totally damaged.3) The Amazon had NO Phone contact number of the sender.4) I am working towards returning the product and close my Amazon Account.
4,Kind Of A Drag- still great,One of my top 5 songs of all time is Kind Of a Drag and it sounds great on the Buckinghams Greatest hits- I highly reccommend it.
3,Buckinghams Offer Their Top Hits - And Many That Weren't,"I'm a fan of the Buckinghams, but their number of hit records is just too limited for a large greatest hits collection. This creates a package loaded down by filler material. Kind of a Drag and Mercy,Mercy,Mercy are certainly worth the price of admission for me. Lawdy Miss Clawdy, Susan, Hey Baby (They're Playin Our Song), Don't You Care and Back in Love Again may be the only music in the collection that will sound familiar to you. Filler material is very common in ""best of"" collections. Take that into consideration before buying this set. Diehard Buckinghams fans will have no problem with it."
3,NOT ENOOUGH HIT'S,This cd does not have enough of there hit's too much filler 3 Star's may be pushing it !
4,Absolutely fantastic cd!,"I recently attended a concert in Savannah, Georgia, where I got to listen to The Buckinghams sing all their greatest hits. They were absolutely great! And, man, did the memories of yester-year come rushing back! This prompted me to try to find a ""greatest hits"" cd. This is it. The ultimate collection of The Buckingham's original recordings. They sound as great today as they ever did in the 60's. Mercy, Mercy, Mercy is an absolute ""must"" for any Buckingham's fan."
5,Great anthology,"The Buckinghams recorded a bunch of Top 40 hits in the late sixties.They recorded on two labels, so this CD brings their entire catalog on one disc with the best songs. Great version of ""Mercy Mercy Mercy""and ""Susan""(with the psychedelic bridge)"
4,Nice Compilation,"Excellent collections of oldies by the Buckinghams, such as Kind of a Drag, I'll Go Crazy, Hey Baby (They're Playing Our Song), Susan, and Mercy, Mercy, Mercy. Recommended if you're a fan of 60's Pop/Rock, and you should remember these as radio hits or popular 45 single records (remember those?)."
3,Good collection for a Rabid Fan,"I would have been better off buying only the tracks I really wanted than buying the whole album. Quality of mp3s was fine, buying on Amazon was fine."
3,Buckinghams,Great album from a great pop musical group from the 1960's. Songs bring back precious memories from my youth. Would recommend it. Good price too.
4,A Donuthead Review,"Dounut head is the story of a boy who is anything but normal. He is the only boy he knows without a father, and with a name just asking to be made fun of. He seems to have an ubsesive compultion when it comes to being clean, and he isnt into getting down and dirty. He can always find a way to get out of playing sports or anything that could be unsafe. But then he meets the dirty faced Sarah Kervick, who is new to his school and is quickly rejected by everyone including donuthead. He soon befriends her and shows her the ture meaning of clean."
2,Paul Hollingsworth the Ba..Headed..Far.. from Cheech and Chong Fame?,"Isn't W. Paul Hollingsworth that bal*-hea*ed flat**s that used to live in Va Beach? I wonder how credible his writing is regarding this material. He was a Trekky, no doubt. And a Mashy. But does that give him credibiiity? I think the book says ""No."""
4,Excellent introduction to the art of making teddy bears.,"Having made teddy bears as a hobby for several years, I wish this book had been available when I was first struggling through my first teddy bear pattern. This book explains it all! It is an excellent introduction to the world of teddy bears, both for those who wish to use the patterns provided and for those who wish to create their own designs."
3,Great book but terrible condition,"I am absolutely in love with this book,pity it's missing the entirevsection on making miniature bears.The rest is very helpful though!"
4,Very good picture quality. It is great to see them on DVD.,"The picture quality of the disc is very good considering the fact that the material is so old. The selections could have been better, because there are some better shorts with Curly that I have enjoyed more. I have waited for Columbia to release the stooges on DVD. Beware of other no-name companies that are releasing the Stooges on DVD, because the quality will not be as good. I did not like the fact that after every short on the DVD, the disc goes back to the menu. I hope on future releases that the disc just plays through all the shorts continuosly without stopping."
1,I Wish I Could Get My Curly Classics To Play,"I bought the three stooges curley classics and couldn't get it to play at all. The dvd player keeps telling me there is NO Disc in player. So i went out and Bought the Three Stooges Collection with Spook Louder,All The Worlds A Stooge and Curly Classics in it and guess what Spook louder and All The Worlds A Stooge play great and the Curly Classics one don't play at all the player is saying NO Disc in player just like the first one i bought i think they better look in to this matter.I would like to know if anybody else is having this problem."
1,I've never truly liked the Three Stooges...,"I have always disliked the 3 Stooges for a number of reasons. First, their comedy gets very old, fast. Five minutes in to a short and I'm ready for it to be over. Okay, Moe slaps Curly, that's funny once, but not 12,000 times! Don't get me wrong, I have a good sense of humor, but I just can't see these guys as funny. The shorts are often tedious and drawn-out, the routines get extremely old after a while, and the acting is well, not exactly Oscar material. Let's just say that the 3 Stooges are funny for maybe five minutes, then after that the steam wears thin and you'll go absolutely crazy if you hear Woob-woob-woob-woob-woob one more time. I don't recommend the 3 Stooges at all."
4,Classic Stooges,Has some very early films -- including the very first (women haters). You can see how their routine changed overtime. Enjoyable.
3,Nostalgia recall,"I bought this for my two grandchildren. The nine year old thought it was just ""silly"". The four year old thought it was ""too funny"".I felt the same way, some of the short stories were funny, but some were just too silly."
3,"Well, they're all classics really...","It's great to see an uncut, crystal clear momument to the genuises of comedy, but again the choices could have been better. How about '3 Little Beers' (my favorite), or 'Uncivil Warriors'. Hopefully very soon..."
2,"Not ""Classics"" at all","I was very disappointed in the episodes selected. The only decent classic was ""A Plumbing We Will Go."" The other 5 episodes were very weak. Unless you don't have any Curly episodes in your house, buy this....the video is excellent, considering the age of these. I hope there is a sequel where there are truly classics, not just episodes picked out of a hat."
4,Classic cut-ups,"A good collection of comedy only the way the 3 Stooges can provide. Samefunny slapstick humor that I remember laughing at as a child. 3 Stooges humor isn't for everyone, or for all the time. But, you can't beat it after a really long, really bad day--a very good alternative to kicking the cat."
3,Don't Hope for La La!,"Actually, La La itself is not a great rock single forAshlee at all, but (yeah....) it still work.... I buy this Single because the Endless Summer and 29 Palms Remix are really good! These are the scores:1. La La 6/10 rocks, but stupid, kiddo. Ehmmm, the lyrics more stupid!2. Endless Summer 8.5/10 Wow, the lyrics really great, the tune really slow and great! I LOOOOVVEEEE this song!!!!!!3. 29 Palms Remix Vocal Mix 7/10 The tune is good even a little bit boring, but still great4. Video 5.5/10 I think it's not really ""suitable"" for Ashlee. Too much light and 20's crazy scenes!"
4,I like this song,"I think ""La La"" by Ashlee Simpson is a pretty good. Not the best by Ashlee Simpson, but very good."
3,Shell Art Handbook,First published in 1965 it is very lean on diagrams or pictures but does give good instructions for multiple projects: including sailor's valentines. A good basic book to learn about crafting with shells.
4,Funny and entertaining!,"Here our hero Nick finds himself in a juvenile detention center with a teenage Gangster. Nick is set up by the police to get the name of a fence from his jail-mate, what follows are incidents of high-velocity octane driven prose and funny punches. Not very good but quite readable - which is quite a miracle, anyway!"
5,krups flf2-j4,"Great kettle. Tidy, fits ANYWHERE: kitchen counter or island, desktop at work, basement workbench, etc etc etc etc."
2,Loved it until it sprung a leak.,I purchased this kettle just over 1 year ago. I really liked the speed with which it boiled water. Being able to remove it from the base with ease made pouring fuss free. Unfortunately my kettle sprung a leak near the bottom of the handle causing the water to seep out slowly onto my counter. I sent it in for warranty repair in the hopes that they would fix it even though it was beyond the 1 year warranty window. Unfortunately they were unable to fix it so it became landfill.
2,Dead in 4 years - water leak,I received my kettle as a replacement to another FLF2 that failed to power up after a few uses. One day we went to use this kettle and found it sitting in pool of water on the counter of our kitchen. It worked well when it did work but the quality and longevity of the product is extremely poor. They do not service this model in the USA. If it is under warranty they will only replace it. Out of warranty and you are out of luck. Leaking is apparently an issue with this model. I don't expect something to work forever but it shouldn't fail completely with light use.
2,Plasticy,"I just received this kettle and was immediately disappointed. It is made of hard, shiny plastic including the interior of the pot. I have an older kettle that looked similar but was much nicer with a metal interior. This felt cheap, but the price did not. Probably will send it back. Ugg."
1,"High hopes, big let down.",We purchased this kettle twice- the first time the power didn't work at all. The heating element didn't turn on even though we heard the distinctive click. Amazon graciously allowed us to return the product for replacement ( though we had to pay for the second one until they received the first one in return and then were refunded). The second kettle was fine for six months until last week when it began leaking from the handle. We will be returning this kettle as well and will not purchase this brand again.
4,"Cord Is A bit Too Short, But Kettle is GREAT","The water heats up in very little time and it is a very well made and well designed kettle except for the shortness of the electrical cord... it is just too short. If they could have added another 4 inches or so, it would have gotten 5 stars."
1,Couldn't give it a lower rating.,"I work for an engineering design company, so when our kettle failed we took it apart to see what went wrong. What we found out was startling! THE UNIT IS ACTUALLY DESIGNED FOR FAILURE!!! It will certainly work for several months, but after that it cannot possibly continue to function. The bottom base is pressed into the plastic shell with a cheap rubber seal between the heating element and the plastic case. After a limited number of uses the rubber seal will begin to leak and you will have water all over your counter. Even more so, if someone inadvertently heats the unit with too little water you will likely have instant failure (but then they can say it is your fault- good one!). Do yourself a favor and AVOID THIS PRODUCT."
1,Unsafe Product,"The product looks good with performance when it is not leaking.Imagine the the safety issue with water leakage from the base when is plugged into the main to boil water. I have couple of the same kettle but having the same problem.I wrote and called customer service for their unsafe product, their answer is read from the book. Send it back for inspection, repair or replacement. I questioned this should not be their first time having this unsafe product compliant, they were silent!Any idea from our other buyers to get them working to resolve this issue to our satisfaction."
1,unpredictable,"We had a Braun Aquaexpress for a couple of years before it failed. When it did we went out to Bed Bath & Beyond to purchase a new kettle. We decided to try the Krups. The water tasted fine, but I noticed that I needed to click the ""on"" button several times before it would start to heat the water. Sometimes it worked right away. It was a bit frustrating to think that your water was ready when it didn't even begin to heat up yet. After several weeks of living with the malfunctioning button, we decided we paid too much for it not to work all the time. Also the whole kettle felt flimsier than the Braun we had. Now we are searching for a new kettle. Maybe we'll go back to the Braun."
1,Water smells like plastic,"Bought this a week ago from Bed, Bath and Beyond. Any water boiled in it smells and tastes like plastic even after days of usage, not just 2 boiling cycles like in the manual. Will definitely return it. My previous Krups kettle was manufactured in France, served me for 8 years with no issues until it broke. This one is made in China, I wonder if the plastics they used are safe."
2,Won't buy Krups products anymore,"Usualy i don't write reviews but this time i have to. Let's start with kettle. I bought it 3 month ago in Bed Bath & Beyond. After on week i start having problems to start boilng water - the ON/OFF buton wouldn't stay at ON position. I went to BB&B and they replace it for new one. Now after 2 months ne one wont shut OFF. The water keeps boiling until i switch buton manualy, plus it seems like there is a water leak on top of the handle. While ago i my firend and i we both bought Krups KM7000 at the same time. Mine came broken, but was replaced by Krups. Both coffe makers died within 1 month after warranty. Krups use to be a good barnd - not anymore i guess... :-("
1,Krups Cordless - a piece of junk,"Despite the higher cost, this kettle turned out to be a cheaply made (made in China) piece of junk. It lasted 3 uses before the switch failed. Unfortunately I bought it elsewhere before I read the very useful reviews on Amazon. As the other reviewers described, the switch just doesn't work -- it cuts off before the water boils, despite numerous attempts at turning it on again (or even holding the switch down to override the cutoff) but it won't boil water. I'm thoroughly disgusted with Krups, which I used to believe was a quality manufacturer. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
3,Krups Water kettle leaking,we own one since last Christmas. Cool device. I love it to make really quickly hot water for tea or soups.....but now it starts leaking out on the back where the handle starts....sad....so sad....thinking to buy a new one on Amazon. I do not have a receipt - it was a gift.
2,Defective Krups kettle,"We got this kettle as a gift on Christmas. Nice,light and excellent looking kettle but the on/off switch is bad design. The switch keeps turning off so you have to hold it down for about 2 minutes and then it works. I am going to throw it away and get another brand."
1,Leaking twice,We had to replace the first one because it started leaking at the base after 9 months. The replacement now does the same exactly after another 9 months. I will not give this kettle another chance.
1,Don't Buy - Leaks - Replaced and Still Leaks,The first one leaked so we got another one and within 8 months it also leaks. Save your money and find another manufacturer. The problem is inconsistent manufacturing so you can easily get a lemon. BEWARE!
1,disappointing,I had it for less than a year and it started leaking water from the bottom. So disappointed. I would not recommend it.
1,Shoddy piece of junk,"I bought two of these, for home and work. Seemed great at first: heats fast and shuts off reliably at boil. After less than a year within a few weeks of each other, both began leaking through a seam in bottom and had to be replaced. Neither was ever dropped or abused, used 2 to 3 times per day.Don't let the German brand name or high price fool you. These are cheap Chinese-made junk sold with a grossly inflated profit margin. Get a cheap kettle with a better rating that doesn't pretend to be a premium product. Krupps has ruined their brand for me with their greedy decision to hire someone to manufacture this garbage and put their name on it."
1,produces toxic smelling water,"This product is attractive and works efficiently; however, my unit produced toxic smelling water the first 5 times I tested it out. I will try a metal electric kettle next."
1,Don't buy this Krups kettle,"I had the same problem with the on/off switch except when mine broke (after only 3 months) it never went back on. Don't buy on-line. Buy where you can replace it and SAVE your receipt. Otherwise I loved it, if it only would work."
1,"Nice kettle, but broke fast","I read this review: ""I bought this kettle 2 1/2 years ago. It looked great, heated water fast, and was easy to clean. We only used it once a day for our morning tea. Two days ago I filled it and turned it on. Within minutes the entire counter was in a puddle of water that had leaked out where the bottom of the handle attached to the pot. The entire heating element was sitting in water."" The exact thing happend to ours. I fully agree with the reviewer I quoted: a $60 small appliance should last longer."
2,Does not turn on,"I have to push the on/off switch at least ten times to get the kettle to stay on. This happened from the first time I used it. I wish I returned it, but I thought the problem might go away with usage. It did not, and the customer service is completely useless. I do not give it one star as the kettle does turn on after many attempts, usually after trying for a few minutes to get it going."
1,In a word...plastic,"Smelled and tasted of plastic. Cheap thin plastic seems to be the reason. I sent back and purchased the Braun in black. Lived in England for years and only electric kettles used there, never had that problem."
1,Water + Electricity = DANGER,"Two of these failed previously - they just stopped working within the warranty period, but we couldn't find the receipts. We bought two new ones (one for each house) because, when they work, they are extremely handy. I know it's abhorrent to true coffee lovers, but I drink instant coffee. They do boil water fairly quickly, when they work. After just a few months, BOTH of the new ones now leak vast quantities of water onto the counter. Fortunately, both kitchens have ground fault interrupters. Although the idea of the design is valid, the manufacturers must have brought in ""value engineers"" to manufacture them even more cheaply. These things are not just overpriced garbage which suffer early failure, they are extremely dangerous. Obviously, the two ""new"" ones are no longer in use. This product should not be sold. My next spare hour will be spent filing a report with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, not that anything will happen."
2,Hate to dislike it!,"This is a great pot. DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING ONE!!!!! It is easy to use, nice looking, functional in every way. But it was not engineered well. The design of the tank to heater pan seal is too tight when the pot is at temperature and so the plastic tank stress fractures at the warmest/weakest point. Usually radiating out from one of the handle mount holes. They all leak after some time but averaging about 6 months.My wife and I have bought 6 of these terrific pots over the last few years and we like them.There is no repair possible short of replacing the whole outer shell so it is not worth repairing the units. We figure it is time to look for something else. If at first you don't succeed, lower your expectations!?"
4,"Good Value, Insulated","This kettle is insulated so when it is hot, you do not burn yourself. It is easy to use and efficient."
4,Works Just Fine,"I bought this kettle recently and have had no issues with it. I followed the instructions by rinsing the entire kettle, then boiling 2 full pots of water. There has been no toxic or other bad odor coming from the water. Perhaps the people who've experienced this problem live in areas such as Dallas with well known problems that have resulted from water shortages and the subsequent build up of algae.The kettle boils water quickly which is very handy when cooking. So far, everything about the kettle works fine. No complaints at all.The only reason for not giving the product 5 stars is that it boils water.. what's 5 star about that? :-)"
2,Unable to function properly,We use this water kettle everyday. The previous one worked for a couple of years broke down and water started to leak whenever the kettle was filled more than 1/2 way (still would not reach the Max level). We thought it broke down because we over-used it and purchased the new one. This one started to leak water after less than 3 mos of usage..we have not been filling it with water that's above the max level - but we have been filling it with more water than before and it cannot handle it! Now we realize that probably this product just fail to function properly. I am very disappointed.
1,Leaks after 1 Year,"I bought this kettle primarily for teas then it became a great idea for boiling water quickly to offer my newborn warm milk at each feeding. So you can say, I use the kettle anywhere from 5-12 times a day. After 1 year, it began leaking badly at the bottom of the handle making it very hard to repair on my own so I called Krups customer service to see if they had a suggestion or a warranty for me to use. It turns out, the reference code at the bottom of the unit makes a huge difference. So buyer beware when you go to BBB to purchase this item in a hurry. Not only do you pay more for it but if you are not aware of the date imbedded in the code then you may be buying a kettle that is already out of warranty. I purchased mine in 2010, but the code had ""0409"" in it making the item out of warranty. I am going to replace my unit with an Aroma kettle. It is more affordable, has great Amazon reviews, and will be shipped for free."
1,leak-tastic,"Yes, it's true. Sooner or later, this will start leaking. For me it took a mere 5 months. So buy something else."
1,Works great till it quits!,"No problem as long as you don't mind replacing it every six months or less.Purchased this kettle about six months ago, it was perfect until last week when it started to leak from the bottom leaving a little puddle of water on the counter each time it was used.I contacted Krups, sure I can send it back at my expense as long as I have the receipt (I don't) and I guess they'll send me another one that will last less than a year also. Should have read the reviews before I purchased this POS. To Krup's credit they said I can send it back without the receipt and if they decide it's under warranty they'll fix or replace it and send it back, if they decide it's not covered they'll let me know the cost to fix it.Two lessons learned: 1: Save the receipt and put it with the users manual 2: Don't buy another product from Krups"
1,lasted 18 months due to design,"I bought this at a Bed Bath and Beyond for about $30 -- it is overpriced at $50 or above, especially as the body is plastic. At that price you can get glass or metal. It lasted about 18 months of moderate use and then started to leak through a crack in the plastic. Quick boiler, but not worth the money given the lack of longevity."
1,Good design...Poor construction,"I have been a reliable Krups customer for many years and thought this was a no brainer. The unit has lasted approximately 2-3 months before water started to leak out of the unit at the joint of the handle base where it attaches to the main cylinder base.KRUPS FLF2J4 Cordless Electric Kettle,?Black"
2,poorly made product,"on off switch breaks easily, seems of flimsy construction. mine lasted 6 months and then the switch broke so I would recommend another brand"
1,Worst Kettle Ever,"DO NOT PURCHASE! we received this as a gift and it worked for about 2 months. we relied on it to boil water for our newborn. when it broke, we contacted Krups and paid to have it repaired, they sent it back exactly the way we sent it in and WE paid for the shipping. Krups is a TERRIBLE product and I would not recommend them ever. We were reliant on this for our newborn and it was expensive to replace, these don't come cheap. I'm extremely disappointed."
2,"Fast boil, but leaky","Like other reviewers, my Krups kettle leaks around the base of the handle. this is the second one in several years that leaked, so unfortunately I will be ordering another brand.It does heat water quickly (has the most wattage of any of the kettles I've seen), but the leaking is really annoying (and is going to damage my kitchen floor soon, where the leakage runs off the counter). If they can fix the leak problem, this is a five-star kettle, but a kettle that doesn't even hold water is a bust."
1,breaks every 5 months,"I bought one that after 5 months started to leak. Still under warranty so replaced with a new one, which then also broke in 5 months in exactly the same way--leaking where the handle met the body. Won't replace with the same lemon. Not worth the postage to send it back again."
2,Not so good,"Like others, my first kettle had a power switch which didn't work. Same for the second, but we just live with it. Now it is leaking between the metal bottom plate and the plastic side. Overall it works, but I expected better from Krups."
3,Great kettle shame about the on button,"I bought this stylish kettle after lots of searching. We have lived in Europe many years and only use electric kettles. After 12 months of faithful use, efficient heating and absolutely no residual taste- the on button wouldn't work. Did online search and Oh My Gosh there are so many unfavourable posts. $55 is a lot to pay for this model. Unless they make this more reliable don't waste your money!"
1,Do Not Purchase This Kettle,"This seems to be a common problem with this kettle. The power button keeps shutting off, right from the start. I have had to hold it down until the water starts to boil and then it will stay on. I replaced it with another new one and the same thing happened. I don't know how this company is getting away with selling a product with such a wide spread defect! Buyer beware!!!!"
2,breaks easily,"I am now having to throw out my second one of these. After having it for a year both times, it stopped working properly."
2,Beware: Started to leak within months,It worked well until it began to leak where the bottom of the handle joins the body of the kettle. There were no preceding falls or trauma of any sort.
2,Leaky,"I had the same problem some of the other reviewers had. My kettle worked great for about a year, but then began to leak near the bottom of the handle. It's very dangerous. This is happening to a lot of people, so it's some sort of a design flaw. I've just junked it and bought another brand. Too bad, because I liked how this one looked and functioned before this happened."
2,"Great Features, Short Life","I love the features of this kettle. However, after 10 months of use, it began to leak around the seam just where the bottom of the handle joins the body of the kettle. Disappointing."
1,It has an odor---,"We bought this Krups FLF2-J4 with anticipation of and excelent machine for our needs. It is a nice looking unit light weight and fast at heating a full load of water. However, an odor is created in the unit and after two weeks of usage it still remains. It hadn't diminished during that time. It smells like burnt plastic and it transfers that to the water for our tea or fresh ground coffee. Not pleasant. We felt it just wasn't safe. I've repacked it and will return it if possible. Krups know of this as they mentioned it in their manual."
1,faulty on/off switch,"It has never worked, from the beginning. If I had time, I'd take it back. We have to hit the on switch anywhere from 4-9x every morning to get it to go to boiling. It just switches off. I'm buying a different one."
2,"I loved it, until today...","I've had this kettle for two years, and I loved it. But today, I came downstairs to water all over my counter and realized that it was leaking from the seam where the bottom of the handle joins the body. I intended to buy another kettle just like it, so I came back to Amazon, but then I read some of the reviews. It appears that this is a recurrent issue that Krups has never chosen to fix. So I'll be going to Bed, Bath & Beyond tonight to look at their kettles. Too bad; I really liked it...."
2,Leaking after three months of use,"Krups FLF2-J4 Cordless Electric 54-Ounce Water Kettle, BlackFor the first three months this tea kettle worked fine, although I do not like the design of the lid, sometimes it stacks in a such position that I can not turn it to open or close position. But the biggest problem that it started to leak in three months. I do not have a receipt, so not sure can return it. I had Braun wk200 tea kettle for about 10 year and it worked great until something was weared off and I could not turn it on. I have bought this model and it did not last very long. I think I will go with newer model of Braun tea kettle also it is expensive."
3,worked well until started to leak,"It was working well for about 2 years, then started to leak around the bottom of the handle as others have mentioned. Too bad it has such a short life-span, particularly because of the price. Along with the other reviews of problems associated with this model, it would appear that there are some serious quality control issues with this Krups product...reluctant to buy another one and will probably try another brand."
2,broke right after 1 year of use,"broke right after 1 year of use, worked just previous load and 5 min later it's dead. try to fix it myself however its bottom lid is hard to open. looks good for 60 bucks though. I then bought a GE for $30."
1,Faulty switch and poor service,"Oh dear...I wish I had noted other reviews of the Krups electric kettle before buying. Like others before me, my kettle has a switch that malfunctions....The switch certainly switches...It switches off and off and off half a dozen times whenever I finally baby water to boil. The consumer people at Krups (1-800-526-5377) were singularly UNhelpful. The nice lady readily acknowledged that the kettle was under warranty but the best she could do was to direct me to a fix-it place in far-away New York where I could expect repair in four to six weeks.Do read the other reviews and do NOT buy this awful product!"
2,FAILED SEAL,"I first owned one in Germany and because Germany runs off 220 the kettle we had heated way faster than any U.S. electric kettle. However moving back to the US we needed to buy one that runs off 110. We purchased this one about 6 months ago and at first it seemed to be a good buy. Then one day I was heating up water and when I came back water was all over the counter. At first I thought I had over filled it, but when I picked it up I noticed that water was running out between the handle and the kettle. Not sure what happen or how it lost its seal, it wasn't like we played football with it or did anything out of the ordinary. In conclusion when it did work the kettle was fast in boiling water but for dependability and durability I would have to give it 2 stars."
2,Disappointing design flaw,"The kettle looked fine; it heated water very quickly - its 1750W power was the reason we chose it in the first place - and we didn't have big issues with plasticky taste. However, after less than a year of daily use, we found the dreaded puddle on the counter under it: the kettle was leaking from the area where the handle joins the body.Krups replaced that kettle, and we hoped it was just that particular kettle and not a design flaw. We've had the replacement kettle less than 6 months, and there is a puddle on our counter again. Plainly this is a design issue; I see from earlier reviews that I'm by no means the only person to have found it out to my cost.Can't recommend this kettle. For the price, and from this maker, we had somehow expected better. We're shopping for a replacement...from a different manufacturer."
2,not impressed,"ln less than 6 months this kettle was leaking and kept turning itself off. l was really disappointed, l was the owner of a Krups coffee maker and thought it would be nice to have the kettle and the coffee maker match. Shortly after l purchased the kettle the coffee maker stopped working, (just 13 months old) l was not impressed with the $10 voucher that l was offered by Krups. Needless to say l did not replace the coffee maker with another Krups.l liked the design of the Krups, however l did find the lid was not that easy take on and off.l have now replaced the kettle with a stainless steel one at half the price from another company."
2,LOVED KETTLE - BUT....,I purchased my Krups electric kettle about a year ago and loved it right from the start. Ditto with the positive features in other reviews. But it just died - won't turn on after only a year or less of use only two or three times a week!! NOT good for Krups reputation. I would like to buy another one just like it but $60 for one year's use seems outrageous to me! I would think Krups could easily improve the switch and stop the leaking problems and wonder why they haven't since this model is so obviously defective.
2,Good design but horribly shoddy construction,"Our previous kettle (Krups AC 17) withstood over 8 years of daily use, so we had high expectations for this one. On initial use, we liked that it boils water very rapidly but doesn't get really hot on the outside, in contrast with its stainless steel competitors. We also liked the easily readable fill gauge on the sides - much better than the ones with the gauge in-line with the handle.HOWEVER, it started leaking from the bottom after only a few months of use (pretty much right after the warranty ran out), and based on the number of similar reviews here, it's clearly not a fluke. Clearly, Krups quality is not what it was - we'll be trying another brand next time around."
2,Quality control is lacking,"At first I LOVED this water kettle. It was so easy to heat up water quickly and safely. I used it all the time. However, after only a year of use the connection between the base and the kettle unit has stopped working. I have to press down on the kettle with brute force to get the unit to work. My husband fixed it so the connectore would touch again, and it only worked once before it shorted out again. Everything else is in perfection condition, but the critical component isn't made to last. I am really disappointed, especially after only a year of use, and a one year warranty of course! Not worth the money!"
2,That faulty switch drives me nuts,"A very handsome product, I was attracted by the Krups name, but within two months it started to switch itself off just after I'd switch it on. So now it's a constant battle between me switching it on and the kettle switching itself off. This seems a familiar complaint. I'm shocked that Krups seems oblivious to these complaints and several consumer websites report its customer service being very unresponsive."
1,leaky non-starter,I bought this because it's stylish-looking and doesn't take up much space and because German products have a good reputation (where is it actually manufactured?) The on/off switch never worked properly and it began to leak early on. I'd lost the receipt so couldn't return it. Bad buy...
1,Faulty handle,Bought mine from Amazon.com and after a year the water began to leak from the handle. Poor construction! Don't waste your money!
3,defective,"The kettle leaks. We expect more out of the Krups brand and it does not live up to the good engineering standards of European brands we have come to love. Other than having a daily flood of water to clean up every day, the lid is difficult to replace properly and sometimes takes two heatings to ""boil""."
1,don't buy this- it leaks!,This is my 3rd electric kettle and the only one that has ever leaked!Don't buy this- this apparently is a common problem with this kettle according to other reviews.
2,Suddenly stopped working after 6 months,"When I first purchased this item I was very happy with it. It boils water very quickly, and I like that the interior is stainless steel (except for the plastic water-level window). I continued to be happy with the purchase for 6 months, when it suddenly stopped working entirely!For the price, I expected a longer life-span -"
2,loved the kettle but it is not well made,"The first one we got was a gift and it quit working after 75 days. It was replaced under warranty and the second one we got worked for almost a year and a half before it started leaking right at the bottom of the handle. I really liked this kettle but for the price, it should have lasted several years. I wouldn't buy another one."
3,A Fair Guide for Bridge finding in Pennsylvania,"This book gives a good bit of detail and history about Covered Bridges in Pennsylvania. The types of structures is very well covered. However, the directions to finding the bridges are difficult to follow. The authors rely heavily on township designations and township route numbers to pinpoint locations. I recently used this book to find several bridges and found the directions here could get me close but township route markers are not always available, it is difficult to get township maps for every township in the state. I had to rely on road markings such as: Low weight limit signs, narrow bridge signs, and low speed limit signs on the roads the bridges were located"
5,Wonderful collection,My autistic grandson is enamoured with covered bridges. This is a wonderful collection of photos and information about covered bridges. Well worth the purchase.
2,Good but not what I was looking for.,"I ordered this book for a annual trip. We toured covered bridges in 4 states. This book was a nice size for travel but mainly had information about what the writers saw. I also purchased Covered Bridges - Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia. This book was much more interesting as it contained information on the history of the bridge, not just the state of the bridge when seen."
4,Very Nice Large Casserole!,"This is a terrific size casserole in French white. My sister needed this size, since it didn't come with her set. I was pleased to find it on Amazon.com. She was very pleased with her Christmas present. Since then this is one of her most used pieces."
2,Not Sure What Happened,"I am sure that when this book left the seller it was in greaat condition, however the way it was packed or handled, the book was bent and the cover was broken. I am hoping this is not how all of their books are sent out, and this accident should be seen as such."
2,Save your money,"I wouldn't say there are any secrets in this book. I'm an experienced product and marketing manager in the high tech industry. There was some interesting information that pertained to licensing terms and some breakouts of budgets, that was it.Definitely not worth $32. Maybe half the price."
1,STOP!!!!!! Don't buy this!!!,"Seriously thrown together and full of issues including video skipping ,total game freezing, horrble AI, custom soundtracks not working again! Some of the worst controls and stiffness to them. Total Garbage I bought this sight unseen because old version was so good I figured even if it was the same on the 360 it would look nicer,nope all garbage.!!! definitely not next gen gaming. Take the $60 you would have spent on this and buy an extra controller or some faceplates or more important start saving for the PS3 because as of yet 360 and all its games are not exciting and not worth it."
1,"This game freezes, unplayable","We bought it April 11, returned it April 12, new one froze up right away just like first one. Gamestop said some other people had same problem. How can they ship a game that won't play for even ten minutes?M.T.,Red Hook,Bklyn"
1,HORRIBLE,Wow this game is just pain bad. Sega came up with a way to make the worst batting interface ever!!!!! 0 stars is what it deserves
2,AVOID THIS GAME,"This game is hard, but it is also just so stupid that even after you figure out how to play it you still don't have fun. I wish I still had my Xbox so I could play MVP baseball. This goes down as the only game ever to make me cry and vomit."
1,Major league Depression,"To start off, just a heads up, you can get this game at Best Buy for $19.99. Which I did. And i still feel ripped off. God what an awful game. If you set some settings say in Franchise mode, they will not be saved no matter how hard you try and will have to set them again everytime you play the game. As someone else said, the only good thing is the pitching. Oh awful awful batting camera. Its not so bad if you have a 42 inch plasma but if you have something like a regular 19 inch TV, you can't see squat. Awful fielding and fielding cam. Bad interface throughout. Truly a bad, bad game."
3,Good but not Worth the Cover Charge,This is an altogether OK game. The presentation is not that great. The graphics are of the 360 'ish level. The price is a little high for a game that for all its features just dosn't feel like that great a game. So if you really want to get a baseball game save some money and buy the O-Xbox copy. The only real diffrence is the graphics.
2,WINNER: Worst Game of the Year,"PROS:- Audio commentary by Jon Miller and Joe MorganCONS:- Like all 2K games, the controls are so overly complex that you can't pickup and play the game. Even when you DO understand the controls, they're so awkward that it isn't even fun.- There's no feel to pitching or hitting. A homerun feels the same as a single. Pitching is a disaster.- Graphics look the same as a PS2 game from 4 years ago. Why does this game warrant a higher price tag???- Game freezes.- Messy interface, difficult to navigate.====================I can't imagine a worse baseball game. Couple this with the freeze issues many people are having, and this is without question one of the worst games for the 360."
1,what the !@$$,"I have been waiting 3 months for this game, what a joke. MLB the show for PSP blows this game away. All i kept hearing about was how good the graphics are going to be. None of the players look like real players, the hitting controls are a joke, and the fielding anamations are horrible. Please MLB, give back the money 2k sports gave you for the rights to make the game so real players like EA sports and other software companys can make a MLB game."
1,WOW! What a disapointment,"Just plain terrible. The Graphics are very poor, especially for the 360, and they are so bad they begin to distract from the game right from the begining. But the real problem is that the gameplay is even worse. Fielding is terrible, player controls are terrible, and baserunning is a joke. The pitching and hitting controls are the only savior. The designers took a fresh approach to the sport and I did actually like their ideas. However, they just can not make up for the rest of the flaws. This title just looks and plays as though it was rushed to the shelves. On top of all of this, player ratings are a complete joke. Anyone with any knowledge of the sport could have done a better job here.All and All do yourself a favor and pass on this game. Maybe next year we can get a little competition and maybe multiple baseball titles to choose from."
1,This game sucks so much!!!!!!!!,"MLB 2K6 its the worst baseball game i have ever played. I was happy with MLB 2K5, last year the graphics looked awesome and the gameplay was great. When i bought 2K6 and played it for just 2 innings the game stoped, the game kept freezen every single time i restarted the machine, i thought it was the xbox 360 that it wasn't working correctly but when i went to the store to change my xbox 360 i told the owner what happened and he told me that it wasn't the xbox it was the game and i wasn't the only one taking the game back to the store. So dont buy this game!!!!! go to the xbox web site and check out the list of xbox game that can be played on the xbox 360."
2,This is an April fool joke right?,I thought this game was going to be the best baseball game ever if they would have just upgraded the rosters on 2k5 it would have been better. Sometimes change isn't good they change all this gameplay and didn't have the decency 2 have a tutorial. The graphics suck and games are not all about the graphics but 2k5 looks better. I'm a EA sports tan and ppl were downgrading their games at least they were realistic I notice on all the 2k sport titles that they have a habbit of putting in all these game modes and extras but they don't do anything 2 the graphics yal need to step yal game up 2k sports cuz all the graphics in your games suck this is definetly trade in bait. Vote 4 EA sports.
1,very dissapointed,"The overall gameplay for this new baseball game is absolutely terrible. I would rather hook up my nintendo and play rbi baseball, do not buy this game you will be nothing but dissapointed....."
1,"The ""WHY 2K"" Everyone Expected!","I don't think I can even type anything good about this game. The gameplay sucks, the Artificial Intelligence is horrible, and the game keeps freezing and skipping randomly to frustrate people even more.The game is also not very user friendly. I often find myself searching to see where I need to go to change game options. Some of the ""improvements"" they made, are the same stuff that EA sports already had with MVP baseball.As for the rosters, they aren't even up to date (even after the online download) and they hardly is any minor league system at all. This game was just thrown together, and is a complete waste of money.Spend your money elsewhere, or you too will be as unsatisfied as I am."
1,AWFUL,"I really wanted to like this game, but the gameplay is boring and stupid and the graphics do not look any better than something you'd see on a PS2 or XBOX. I can't decide what's worse: pitching or hitting. Even after you get used to it, the hitting is boring and frustrating. As far as pitching, it is nothing new except that the catcher regularly misses the ball and then when you send him after it, the controls get screwy and he often runs right past the ball (sometimes even runs circles around it, does anything but actually pick it up) while anyone on base can probably make it all the way to 3rd, if not home. Don't even bother renting it."
2,this game is terrible,2K6 ruined baseball games. EA's MVP will be sorley missed. This game is awful.
3,Pass,"Pass on this book. Although not everyone can tour Yankee Stadium and ask any question they like (and get very good answers), I expected a lot when I looked at the table of contents for the first section. Unfortunately, the answers are skimpy and insufficient, especially considering that the subtitle claims to be ""the total encyclopedia of the team"". Not hardly. The latter section of statistics may be useless, dated or just good for historical purposes. I would pass."
1,Don't bother,"Although there are some solid tips I'd be reluctant to recommend this product. If you're looking for a step by step journey thru a long and interesting 3d model lesson you are going to me like me, Massively disappointed. As a level 2 product it feels very level 1 still and at times a little insulting. You never really get into any serious tutorials at least nothing that I didn't know already. If you think that you're going to be doing the project that's on the cover of the disk case, well hold on to your pants because you're NOT! There's really nothing here that I couldn't of gotten off of some random Youtube videos. To be honest I never even copied the projects off the disk because they were that uninteresting. I also had trouble playing this disk on several Mac machines so beware. So do yourself a favor and save your money and shame on you go-to-school.com. This is a subpar product. It looks like you spent more time on the interface than you did on the content."
1,"Great mixer, but look out","This mixer, like most Behringer products, has great features at a great price. It would make a good mixer for a private studio, but NEVER depend on any Behringer product for a live performance unless you have a full backup quickly available. Behringer power supplies stink, and will poop out on you when it is least convenient - more than once for me. I'll never buy another Behringer product. You get what you pay for."
2,Didn't last more than 3 uses!!,This thing snapped after using it 3 times. it does not fold up that easy and it snapped on the third use and wouldn't stand up correctly after that. Not worth the money
2,lasted one summer,"The design is not that bad, although one has to place something heavy inside (other than a baby) in windy weather. The poles snapped at the beginning of our second summer, which would have concluded the short life of this sun-dome, had my husband not been so keen to fix it with rolled up soda-can sheets, tape and a sewing kit.If you are into fixing things that are not really worth your time, it's an excellent challenge. Otherwise, I would not recommend this product."
3,"Roomy, but hard to fold","Roomy, but hard to fold. Has pockets to fill with sand which helps in the wind. Poles are cheap and broke in two spots. Fixed with some zipties and tape."
1,Horrible product,"I bought this product for my baby to play outside in our yard. It is very difficult to fold into its case so unless you have lots of time on your hands, do not buy this sun dome. The poles that hold it up break very easily and are impossible to repair. Save yourself time and money by buying something else."
1,WASTED MONEY,"The Kel-Gar Kid's Sun Dome was a total failure. We were looking for something that we could bring on the beach for our little sun. Here's what didn't work:- it gets pretty hot, and provide not much shadow- it blows away even if you feel the two side pockets- it breaks at any time you try to fold it back- the instruction aren't clear on how to fold itI would give a ZERO to this product. we barely used it three times. The structural folding rings broke in several pieces and we weren't able to use it again."
1,Please save yourself the hassle!,"I bought this tent dispute the numerous bad reviews, and it turned out to be as bad as they said! Please save yourself the hassle. This tent broke before I was even able to use it. I was so mad at myself, but even more mad at the manufacturer for making such a horrible product! Please please please don't purchase!"
3,Needs instructions,"Length:: 0:36 MinsKel Gar would be wise to include instructions for folding the tent with the product. For those who, like me, struggled putting it away for the first time I've included a video. (It's surprisingly difficult to explain in words) The tent worked fine on a calm day but a modest breeze caused it to fold. The zipper on the bag failed after a couple of uses."
1,Awful product,I live near the beach and thought that this would be a great thing to have for my daughter. The first time I used it the dome was so flimsy it completely blew over my daughter while she slept in it. The second time the pole snapped rendering it useless. The customer service at Kelgar was unhelpful and unapologetic.
1,Hazardous!!,"DANGER!! We've been through two of these in two summers and both times a rod snapped, cutting through the fabric, making the product dangerous. The first time my son was an infant and we caught it right away. This time my son was injured! I also gave one as a gift my sister in law around the time we initially purchased the product for our son and she had the same problem. After 3 uses she had to throw it away. I was able to exchange mine the first time, but this time I was told to contact Kel-Gar directly. Kel-Gar claims there is nothing they can do and will not work with us. Very frustrated and would encourage buyers to look at different companies and products."
2,difficult to fold,"we purchased this last year for our new baby. it took a couple of tries to get it folded the right way. once we got it in the bag, we put it away until needed again. I took it to the beach a few weeks ago and found that the tubular pieces inside were broken. we are very disappointed in this sun dome. i don't think this is worth $40 at all. the only good thing is that it has adequate space inside."
1,Perfect except it breaks into pieces,"Perfect, matched exactly what I was looking for. Folded up nicely and quick. Of course, I followed those directions, folds up like the sun shades for your car's windshield, no problem, I can do that. Opened it up for its third use, one totally broke pole and two kinked poles. Poor baby has a saggy, dilapidated sun dome now:( Wrote company with complaint today and we will see what they say/do."
1,Worthless unless no wind or sun,"I purchased this tent to protect my babies from the sun at the beach, but upon using it today, I found it utterly worthless. If there is any wind at all the tent blows down so that it covers the babies inside, and there are so many see-through screen areas that it hardly blocks the sun at all. If there is sun and wind the you would be better off not having the tent at all. If there is no sun and wind, then this would be a great product."
2,Too slow and never arrives where it was headed....disingenuous actually.,"A movie like this didn't need to move fast or have action. But it still moved far too slow. Some good ideas, and the main characters are very likeable until they aren't. The background tune for the first half of the movie is mind numbingly insipid. Looks very nice despite the low budget. But the interesting ideas, and viewpoints of a couple quirky people start off and then don't get anywhere. Too much promised, not enough delivered.I was glad I watched it, it was different than mainstream movie fare these days. But I just can't give it more than a couple stars. In the end it was quite shallow and incomplete. Then to make it worse, the ending was quite disingenuous. Almost enough to make me take away another star. But I will leave it at two."
2,If...the middle word of life,"and lifeless is the best word to describe this film. Encyclopedia of obsolete things...interesting premise...if only there was an intriguing narrative. Brilliant scientist that has prophetic vision...if only there was life and character in the script. Boring actors...if they only had a clue. If only there was one word other word to describe the sum of it all...there is, banal."
4,Dance in the Sun,"A beautiful movie. I don't know much about cinema, but this one is worth seeing for just a few bucks. I especially loved the old photography, silhouette scenes, and George listing encyclopedia entries. It wouldn't be rated higher than PG."
4,Fine Orfeo,This set of Orfeo ed Euridice offers a lovely memento of RiseStevens even if she is a trifle past her best - she has a warmand velvety voice but is a little unsteady at times - howeverher undeniable artistry is still in evidence and she portraysa vibrant Orfeo. Lisa della Casa is a radiant Euridice - hercrystalline voice at its most attractive. The very young Rober-ta Peters is a delighful Amore singing with precision and musi-cality. Chorus and orchestra are a bit rough for Gluck and Maes-tro Monteux is occasionally sluggish in his tempos. Good earlystereo sound and including all the ballet music. A fine set.
5,London Fog,"The dreary London fog creates an excellent setting for this tale of espionage. Stolen submarine plans along with a dead body are just what the doctor ordered for this ""somber stage"". Another successful re-enactment of a Doyle classic. Does anyone know of a bad one? I surely don't."
5,Refreshing,"This is a wonderfully refresshing CD that appeals to everyone in the family. I have four sons ranging in age from 17 to 3 and all of us have found a track on this CD that we call our favorite. It is really nice to be able to ""sneak"" in some inspirational music and not have my teenagers beg me not to change the music. Keep up the great work!!!"
4,Glycerin based Skullcap,"As a skullcap elixir, Nature's Answer Skullcap Herb, 1-Ounce works, and it's a good price here at Amazon, but be advised that it's glycerine based. I've found that I need to take more drops on the tongue (how I take the stuff) than other products without glycerin, so the cost per effective dose becomes higher. As with other products, it's important to consider the dosage, so this is not my Skullcap of choice after all. If you like a glycerin based Skullcap, then this one is a very good option."
3,Not for me - causes IC flares,"It was recommended that I try this for herbal assistance for the stress associated with IC. While I've heard it works for many, it gave me terrible, days long flares. I gave it to a friend and it is working very well for her (she has IBS)."
4,Nice,"Nice light, it was purchased for a customer of ours and they were very pleased with the appearance of the light"
2,Tedium long before the excitement finally begins.,"I have often heard of Zane Grey, the ""Father of the modern Western novel."" And I have heard of this book. I finally got around to read it, to my dismay. Surprisingly, at least to me, it appears to be mostly a treatise against the Mormon religion and it's treatment of women. Secondly, it is a travelogue with ongoing, over-the-top, boring descriptions of the countryside. I challenge anyone to draw a sketch or a map from the word pictures of the area that Grey concocts. In a way, I am glad I stuck with the book - although I was very tempted to quit at several junctures - because the last 30 pages or so have the thrill of adventure I would expect from a Western. With so many other authors to explore, it will probably be a long time, if ever, before I return to Zane Grey."
3,ok,have purchased before and would buy again i love this product. packaged well and arrived on time with good delivery.
4,Give yourself time for this one,"Grey is beautifully descriptive and the pace is slow moving, so the story takes a while to develop. Once I relaxed into the book and became accustomed to Grey's writing style, I really enjoyed this book."
3,A classic,"Zane Gray was a favorite of my grandmother's. She would read his novels as a child. When I discovered this in some of her writings recently, I found myself wanting to read a few of his novels."
4,No Tracking,"I never received the book, which was a great disappointment. It evidently is lost in the mail somewhere. It was sent without any tracking or delivery confirmation so it has been impossible to try to locate it.I really wanted the book because it is an unedited version different from the popular press editions--containing much more adult material. It is a hard book to find.I wish all sellers would take on the added expense of tracking and delivery confirmation. As a buyer I would welcome any extra shipping charges."
2,A Classic,"It was a good read but took too long to really get going. Still, Mr. Grey can weave a fine yarn and his powers of description are stunning."
2,Not my cup o' tea!,"I tried very hard to get into into.......just couldn't get past the forty foot deep colorful FLUFFRead ""Wildfire"" first and it was fairly entertaining.....tried another....nope."
2,Good book,At times I find it hard to follow. Too much repeating of the same description of the sage. Not sure who I would recommend this book to.
4,Good fun read,"Classic western,felt as if I was there. Fun,good guy wins girl and game. Will read more Zane grey books soon."
4,Riders of the Purple Sage,"Riders of the Purple Sage was very good, I don't really know why I just gave it a four star rating."
3,Not a huge Zane Grey fan,"Its a pretty good story, but it seems as the reader I'm am on the outside looking in through a screen door - not directly involved in the story. On top of that I had to stumble over the wordy prose to get to the story. Beautifully written, but I read for pleasure, not to interpret art.An example of the writing style is that there are pages of poetic prose about the lay of the land and details of a trek, but a very importtant shootout is described in summary after the fact. Late in the story, Lassiter rescues a kidnapped girl and in a matter of 3 sentences described the battle, after the fact. So I read for 30 minutes about the color of the trees and the angle of the walls in the canyon and I get 10 seconds of one of the most important shootouts in the book.I am a huge Louis Lamour fan and prefer his style. Each to his own. Obviously Zane Grey has millions of readers, so its just me."
2,Too much,I am an avid fan of western novels but could barely get through this one... Too much detail where it wasn't needed... Too much about characters that didn't need to be told....too much story...just too long...
1,"magnifier, please","I have never, ever seen a book printed in such miniscule type as this one. There is no way for me to read this without a very strong magnifier, and I doubt anyone else could either. The unusual size type should have been noted somewhere in the book's description. I am very annoyed that now I have to go to the trouble and expense of returning this book, or just consider it a total loss. Fool me once......."
4,Riders of the Purple Sage,Read this book years ago. Now I had to have it..No wonder there was a music group by this name. A great classic
3,I had forgotten how cruel this story was,"I re-read this story after many, many years. It was remembered as a good story, but, as I went through it again, I was disgusted by the cruelty of the people toward one of their own. Over and over this theme is replayed and overshadows the beauty of the scenery. I won't be reading it again."
3,Unusal,This was a gift to my husband. He read it as it was a required book in school - he is 84 and finally got around to it. His opinion was there was too much killing! I can't say as I did not read it.
4,Romantic comedy gem,"Tabloid reporter Hope Spencer has fled to the mountains of Idaho for a little R&R; after being stalked by one of her subjects. She wants to keep her identity a secret, but finds herself attracted to Dylan, the sexy town sheriff who seems just as attracted, but is keeping secrets of his own. As she enjoys her days spending time with Dylan and his son Adam, her reporters instincts kick in when she discovers that Dylan shares a past with an infamous actress who Hope has crossed paths with, and finds herself having to make a decision between love and the advancement of her career. Which will she choose?Set in Truly, Idaho, Gibson's fictional town populated with eclectic and endearing citizens, this is one of her shining moments as a novelist, as plot, character development, romance, and humor collide to make a near-perfect story."
4,Light Casual Read,I love this author and have read most of her books. This one is one of her best. It's quirky characters are hilarious. I want to meet all of them.
4,enjoy and suspend belief,"best i have seen from the author. i am an avid reader and while it is light reading her grammar, spelling and storyline didn't detract from the pleasure of the read. fun and escape worthy!"
4,Tabloid love,"I love reading Rachel Gibson, her stories are light and easy. This one ended a little too soon and I would have liked for the characters to develop a little more.This was a good book and what you expect from Rachel Gibson. I like to read her books before bed, they make for happy dreams.Hope and Dylan are fun characters and I would have liked to gotten to know Adam a little better."
5,Great read. Witty and sexy!Sandy (SC),"I just happened to pick up this book while looking for something to read. I had never read anything from Rachel Gibson, so I didn't know what to expect. I have to say I was hooked right from the beginning. I have, since this book, read every book that Rachel Gibson has written except for ""See Jane Score"" (Only because I haven't been able to find it anywhere). I have enjoyed each and every one of her books and can't wait until the next one comes out.Please keep writing Rachel Gibson so I can keep on reading."
1,You will be dumber for reading this book,"Sorry, but this is a BIG letdown by Rachel Gibson. The story is ridiculous and far-fetched. And I did not like either the hero or heroine.How can any self-respecting woman make a career out of conning people with hocus-pocus stories about Aliens, Midgets and Cross-dressing sheriffs? And how can the sheriff in question, shown to be egomaniacal, take this nonsense lying down?You will get a sense of deja vu if you have read this author before.Try ""Simply Irresistible"" instead and save your sanity."
2,Think Twice Before Buying This One,"I must confess this book wasn't one of Rachel Gibson best. The whole story line was real dorky. The tabloid thing got old real fast. The charactors were very low key. Hope Spencer's ""BIG"" was like ""HUH"" and your problem is. And the ""BIG"" story of the ex-sheriff was like watching pasta cooking. So many things got started in the book, but nothing ever develope."
5,True Confessions,This book was fabulous - it's the type that just gets your mind off of everyday things - all of Rachel Gibsons books are great
1,Not a quick read.,"All I can say is burnt toast is not this dry.The story is the same as the last few, big city girl moves to small town and falls in love with local stud. If you have read any other Rachel Gibson books than you will be disappointed in this one. You have read this story before. However, the last time you read it the love scenes were hotter and the characters were more interesting."
5,I Must Confess - I Loved It!!,"This book was fun and fast paced. I started it in the afternoon and stayed up until 2:00 am to finish. Hope is a great herione. She's independent, outspoken, witty and I think it's great that she writes for a fictional tabloid(Something new and different for once). Dylan is fabuolus! He is smart, sexy and a great father. The relationship between Hope & Dylan is entertaining and has lots of sexual tension. I would highly recommend this book."
5,Fun read,"I stayed up half the night reading this book - it was funny and sensual. I loved the characters, Hope & Dylan and they were HOT. I love books like this but I only wish there were real guys like Dylan. Rachel Gibson is great and I always enjoy her books. Keep them coming!"
2,Sadly...not the original!,"After watching a Magoo short tacked onto our Mr. Magoo's A Christmas Carol disk, my kids were in love with Mr. Magoo! I shied away from the box-set because reviews complained of censorship that ruined their nostalgia surrounding the cartoon, so I purchased several of these titles, not realizing they were a re-made series from the 70s. Unfortunately, not funny...not clever...not sharp like the original series. Boo. Disappointing!!!"
4,Coincidence,I enjoyed watching this series of shows featuring Mr. Magoo and his pet. Somehow I could not help but notice the similarities between the voices of Mr. Magoo and his dog. For a moment I thought that their voices were identical.
4,Good old cartoons,Mr. Magoo: Come Back Little McBarkerI loved Mr. Magoo as a child and wanted to share it with my grandchildren. It is nice to sit down with them and watch some good old cartoons. I was glad I could find it on Amazon.com
4,A great forgotten melodrama,"It was the best-selling novel of the nineteenth century and with its hypnotic descriptions and delicious dramatic irony; it's easy to see why. This Faustian tale of a man's corruption by wealth, society and his own vanity under the guidance of a devilish temptor while common enough has a unique twist in that the devil himself hates his job of temptation as it divides him from heaven. The reader can delight in the double meanings of the novel, knowing what the hero cannot see in his ""benefactor"".The book is melodramatic, and at times longwinded, and sadly occassionally whiny, but it is strangely absorbing even when it descends into silliness, and the characters can be understood and to some extent sympathized with. It is not one of the great works, but it is a work of great conception."
1,Dog Christmas Stocking,"Unfortunately, my English Springer enjoys chewing. All toys were finished in under 15 minutes. Going forward, I will make my own stocking."
5,A hit,I have a chi/dachsund and the toys in this stockingare perfect for small dogs. He loves all of them speciallythe rope.
5,Pica's Christmas Toys,"Just the right size for her little mouth, She loves them, plays with them all the time, Good buy for the price"
5,Franklins Halloween,Franklin's Halloween is a pleasant story that shows the value of being a good friend .
5,To Squeal or not to Squeal,"This was an order in desperation... I had replace the blower motor three time with two local autoparts stores. The expense was almost twice as much. I found this as such a low price I had to give it a try and was so happy that I did. When I installed it and was able to drive my vehicle without any anoying whine or squeal, just the sound of blowing air. deliver was quick and spot on. Thanks again."
5,Dodge Front blower motor,"Item arrived on time, It has been installed quieter than origanal motor, easy install so far so goodI would recommened to any one needing this blower motor"
1,Might be good but.....,This might be a good product but. What size is it? Are the selves adjustable? What is it made of? This and many more questions I would have before I would buy it.
5,"Great Keychain, Nice product.","This is a very nice keychain. The artistic detail is very well done. Good for collecting. Small enough for the pocket, and large enough to be noticable."
3,not our favorite,"We love Sandra boynton in this house. However this one isnt very popular. Nothing wrong with it, i just dont think it's as catchy as her others."
5,most have,"So cute. My son things this book is so funny, I think its lots of fun for your little ones, My son is 2 years old and love all her books, must have"
3,It's okay,This book is cute but it is not as fun as other books offered by this author. My son doesn't show much interest in it.
5,Great book.,Bought this as a gift for my soon-to-be niece. My kids love this book and they were excited to give it as a gift to their aunt.
5,Great Book!!!,"Great Quality and Great service! Would use them again, and recommend them to all of my friends. Just great overall experience!!! Great Book"
4,Amusing and cute,"Although I love this book, my granddaughter likes it, preferring other Boynton books. Of course that may change over time. Boynton books never disappoint."
3,Amazon.com used book purchase,"Cute book! Too bad it came pretty well worn, and took a while to get to me, luckily I wasn't in a hurry. . I don't remember them warning me about that, though."
2,Disappointed,"Wasn't the best Boynton board book I've read. I find that with Boynton, you need to read the book in the bookstore to see if it's a good one. There actually quite a few that are not that great."
2,Not the best Boyton book.,I was disapointed with this Boynton book. It is not a cute and clever as some of her others. My son seems to like it well enough but it is not as enjoyable as The Going to Bed Book or Barnyard Dance. I would skip buying this one.
4,Cute and funny...,"This book makes me smile and laugh every time I read it to my daughter. The only criticism I have is that the hippos wear ""bathing suits too little"" and ""don't do much throughout the day"". The hippos are not indecent in any way but these aren't values I want to instill. Other than that, it is cute with sing-song rhythms and fun pictures of hippos."
2,Strange Book,"A book titled the ""Belly Button Book"" sounds silly, cute, or funny. This book is just down-right strange. The verses are awkward, and the story seems meaningless. (Not that one should expect great plot development in 20 cardboard pages) Boynton's other books make this one pale in comparison."
2,Lacking the Boynton magic,"I am a big fan of several of Boynton's books including""Barnyard Dance"", ""A is for Angry"", ""Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaurs"" and ""The Going to Bed Book"".Those all have charm, wit and a resonance with me. The Belly Button book had a lot of potential but just didn't come across. The prose is stitled and awkward in its phrasing and rhyming and doesn't always make much sense. For instance, there are some hippos at the beach and the text says ""We don't do much throughout the day. That's how we like it best. We nibble grapes and watch the waves. We take a little rest."" Maybe I'm missing something.... What does this have to do with belly buttons and why are they eating grapes?Oh well. I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because her drawings are still warm and friendly."
5,The World's most perfect book in the eyes of a 16-month-old,"My son picked this book out at our last trip to the library. That was over three weeks ago. Since then, he has insisted on us reading it at least once every day and gets quite upset when I try to suggest another book. Sometimes we read it twice in a row! Obviously, before this book is returned to the library we will have to purchase our own copy. My son has two favorite parts to this book: The first is when the hippopotomus is explaining what ""bee bo"" means (BELLY BUTTON!!!); my son breaks out in a huge grin there. The second is for the belly button song. I'm not sure what the tune to the song is so we just made something up but there's no avoiding having to sing the song repeatedly. My son won't let me turn the page until I've sung several rounds. This was a surprise hit for us and I highly recommend it for anyone in this age group."
5,I am addicted!,"I know that this book was supposed to be for my daughter, but I am usually the one who giggles the most at 'bee-boo' and other cute parts of the book."
5,Another great Boynton book,"Let's face it Sandra Boyton rocks. Her books are fabulous, her illustrations distinct and catchy and cute. This one, about how much Hippos love their belly buttons, was an immediate hit with my three daughters (ages 1, 3 and 3).add it to your Boynton collection!"
5,Hippos are huge!,"All of Sandra Boynton's books are terrific and highly recommended. As far as the hippos being 'immodest' - come on where are you going to find clothes big enough for a hippo? I'm sure that when a child looks at pictures of a hippo (do they really wear clothes?!!!), that they are going to see more than a hippo who is half-dressed and being immodest. It's supposed to be funny - if that is what the parent sees - then maybe that is what the child will see. I think her books are wonderful, funny, and my 2 1/2 yo loves them, as well as my 10 mo old."
5,Belly Button Book,"My first Boynton. Now I'm collecting them all for my great niece. I even shared ""beebo"" with my co-workers. Outstanding author for very young children."
1,Lasted less that week.,Bracelet is strung together on strecthy band type string. Found it to be very bothersome to wear due to it expanding on wrist with any kind of arm movement. Finally on about 3-4 time wearing while at work and moving arms it stretched too far and broke and the piecec went flying and some shattered. I wouldn't buy this again. I recommend something more strung together with wire type string.
1,One empty cartridge = printer shutdown,"The cartridges for Brother printers tend to dry out. When one cartridge drys out, the printer stops, even when the others are all that is needed."
4,"Great moments; inconsistent, however","Ghost Train starts off promisingly, with some really good frights and mayhem; the dream parts are truly creepy; however, I found the basic premises underlying all the events (as explained immediately prior to the final section of the book) hard to swallow, and I was not satisfied with the ending. He is an undeniably good writer, and since this was his first book, he has a good excuse for not being in top form, but I simply can't give this book 5 stars because his other books may be great, so I would give it four stars overall, the first 2/3 would get 5 stars."
4,"Ghost Train, A Journey you never want to make!","Yet another master creation from arguably the best horror writer on the block. Laws's fluid style ensures you just can't put this book down. The number of people who can, convincingly, create believable horror stories can be counted on the fingers of one hand. With GHOST TRAIN, Stephen Laws enters the rank and could, judging by this truly frightening debut, become number one. If you like a well-written supernatural novel and think you can survive 300 pulse-pounding pages of sheer terror, don't miss GHOST TRAIN. The train of the title doesn't even fully reveal its palpably evil nature until deep into the book. Long before this time, the reader is fully in the grip of Stephen Laws' witches brew of calculated creepiness. Stand aside Stephen King, James Herbert and Clive Barker and let through a new heir to the horror throne!"
4,found a hot pack source,"Like others, the hot/cold pack opened up in the microwave and is not useable.I found a company named Roshgo Corporation that makes temperature control products. They sell an item called REACTRO that is a reuable hot gel pack. They also sell one called FREEZEZE which is a gel ice pack refrigerant. You can call toll free- 1-888-4-ROSHGO. They are out of Alpharetta, GA. The product is great if you can get the packs to work."
3,Hot over the Hot Pack,"I would have given it a five-star rating if I could find the Hot Pack Replacement. There are several women at my church who would like to know where to purchase these. One woman has bought 3 complete portables because she can't find a replacement hot pack. There used to be a Corning Ware Outlet store in our area which sold them, but it closed and I can't even find where one is on the internet. Please provide information as to how all of us upset Pyrex Portable users are because of one accessory which we have been unable to purchase separately."
1,Hot Pack? Phoey!,"Great idea, however, there is no place to order extra hot packs.Mine blew up in the micro and now I have nothing very special."
3,Pyrex Portable,I really checked this out. I thought I was getting a 9 X 13 size pyrex pan and I did not. I got a 7x11. Will not order from this site again. Ebay gives better discription of products I've purchased.
5,"Excellent, the best general purpose hardware out there","I have owned the Winn L. Rosch Hardware Bible 3rd edition for 2 years now and I have not managed to find another book as complete, readable, and as close to the kind of hardware book one could wish for in order to learn everything there is to know in this field (as opposed to hardware programming books such as PC Intern) as it. Other books mainly concentrate on upgrades and repair, that meaning there is a lot of overhead for discussing computer design rather than it's concepts and technical parameters. The ""Bible"" does not limit itself for comprehensiveness and is THE definitive book to get for beginners and experts alike (hence it's all around user level). My life changed with the ""bible"", enough to make hardware my religion!"
3,"Incomplete, Mispelled, and opinionated.","Unrivaled amounts of knowledge are combined with incomplete blurbs about the knowledge, and disappointing mistypes that pass even the best spell-check.For example, in the Display Adapters section, under the heading ""MMX Technology"" at top of page 744, the Advanced Graphics port is given three different names. AGI, ACP, and finally AGP. All this in less than a quarter of one page! In the same chapter, a UMA graphics port is ""completely"" covered- in three sentences! (a little more information, please?)There exist entirely too many bad ""jokes"" to list this book as a reputable reference book as well.It's too bad all this information had to be sabotaged!"
2,adequate,I've owned the Mueller and Minasi books previously. Recnetly I decided to go for a change of heart and try Rosch's but I was severely disappointed in the comparison: Rosch does not have the depth of the other two nor is it as well written. This could be a really good book for a beginner BUT I don't think with this book you will progress beyond that stage.Get Mueller's Upgrading and Repairing or Minasi's gold standard instead. Minasi's is the best on the subject for a beginner to an advanced hardward engineer who needs to keep up on the ever changing hardware environment; Mueller's fills in some technician gaps; Rosch is a distant third.
4,A nice book...but a lot to read...and more on CD-ROM,"A very complete discussion of computer hardware especially on the PC side. The size of it makes it formidable, but a good reference. The price is reasonable considering the abundance of information in it."
5,Perfect professional's reference book,"As a computer professional I have found the Hardware Bible an invaluable resource both as a reference work and as an aid to keeping up with the latest technologies in the ever changing computer field. Everything is explained in a straightforward and easy to understand manner, including the latest innovations such as SDRAM and AGP with just enough detail to be useful but not so deep as to be incomprehensible.The book is geared towards people who have some basic knowledge of computers but is not too technical for a casual tinkerer. If you have a curiosity about what everything in a computer is and does then this is the perfect book for you."
1,Dont get this.,The game was much like a more sophisticated form of zelda. The overall game play was not very good. Its confusing most of the time. Not a very good play.
1,ehh,this game is just ok.. I played it for about an hour or so hoping it would get better but to say it in short.. it is gone
2,not worth 60 bucks,I rented this game and played it for a bit. and found it to be very boring. they could have made it a lot better.the graphics are ok and the controls are easy. it seems like the weapons were useless. the vampires are so fast you relly don't have time to do anything.that's why i gave it 2 stars. if you are looking for a good new release to play try the darkness it's a great game.
2,"Syphon Filter, with vampires thrown in there","Yeah this game really sucked, no pun intended but I can't really name too many highlights. I know there's an argument saying ""it's not a terrible game,"" but this is definitely not nex-gen material. I know that's becoming a new trend now, people putting down games that they feel are not up to next-gen standards, but this game REALLY isn't. My roommate reserved this, mainly cause the preview looked awesome, long story short major disappointment. This would actually be a pretty cool title on the PS2 I think. The controls really don't fit right with the 360 controller, and I think for the stealth games, the PS2 controller has its advantages. (i.e. Metal Gear Solid) The graphics look well polished but you can tell they didn't make any effort to place it with the rest of the current 360 titles. If you're still not convinced, I can only urge that you rent before you splurge."
4,Must-have auto tool!,"I bought an Emergency Tool for my own vehicle about three years ago on clearance at TJ Maxx for about $5. Well, my son just got his driver's license, and I wanted one of these for him as well. We spend a great deal of time in Jacksonville, FL, and if you've ever been there then you know they don't call it the River City for nothing. There are lots of bridges. I couldn't find one of these tools in a store anywhere! So, I started looking online and found several, just like this one for up to $80! I came back to Amazon, found several different ones to choose from and settled on this one for my boy. I've never had to use mine, and I pray that he never has to use his, but I feel better knowing he's got it in his truck."
5,nice,more sturdy than I expected. I would recommend it to a friend. I got one for both of our vehicles.
2,Uninspired photos of colored diamonds,"This is a rather thin, over-sized, hardcover book. My first impression was ""This is it? This is all there is?"" The text is intersting but I was looking for good photos of the individual or groups of diamonds. What you get are pages of uninspired face-on photos (256 in all, I think) of the diamonds in the collection, cropped to the shapes of the stones, with nothing else to make them look remotely interesting. Next to each small (less than an inch) photo is a brief description. The book is mainly a catalog color names with an occasional colorful description or story about a particular diamond. Two stars because it is somewhat interesting to read and the pictures and descriptions are somewhat informative. But if you are looking for nice photos, look elsewhere."
5,LOVED IT!!,"What a great way to stain...DRIP FREE!! I bought some stain sponges and dipped the sponge, squeezed out the excess and let loose on everything! My dingy doors that were sun faded and we were going to replace look nearly new. Best thing yet, we got the throw away Nitrile gloves and when I was done, gloves and stain sponge went right in the trash! NO CLEANUP!! Best buy I've ever made."
3,Not on Butcher Block,"I purchased this stain for use on maple butch block. I also used the pre stain by minwax but unfortunately the results were less than desirable. Even with pre stain it does not penetrate well. I purchased the regular thin stain and the block stained beautifully. I was however able to use this on some of the trim in my home and it worked Ok. I could see that this would be a good option for vertical or difficult to stain surfaces, Doors ect"
4,Buy local to save a few dollars,"Our local stores discontinued stocking this item, so we resorted to Amazon. A little pricer, so buy locally if you can. We were in need for it quickly."
4,What I was looking for,"Our local stores discontinued stocking this item, so we resorted to Amazon. A little pricer, but we needed it."
5,Excellent reference source,"Stiller has created a fabulous reference source for the contemporary composer. He accurately covers information on almost every instrument and gives both detailed information as well as quick chart summaries. He spends a great deal of time dealing with modern and experimental techniques for many instruments, something which is not often dealt with in these kind of volumes. Its easy to use indexing system also makes it a wonderful ""quick reference"" source for when you might quickly need to know a piece of information like instrumental ranges. In my opinion, this is one of the best books of its kind available today."
1,Vindictive attempt to capitalize on a name,"When I first read the former Mrs. Tritt describe how she thought she was better then Travis, when they first met... I should have known how this book would end. This is a one-sided and ""it's all his fault"" type of recounting of a life story. And a very bad one. I'm glad I bought this book used, so I didn't waste so much money on it. If you want to read how a bitter female can be very vindictive, buy this. But I'd suggest you don't waste your money. Read between the lines though, at what she doesn't say. That's very revealing as well."
5,A Beautifully written book about a first love...TRAVIS TRITT,"Karen Tritt Ryon tells her story that we can all relate to so well about our first loves....But unfortunately she has to watch her first love go on to fame. And her first love is not so easy to push to the back of her memories. He becomes the famous and sexy TRAVIS TRITT. A bittersweet, well written love story."
2,Poorly Sized Shirt,"All of my T-shirts are Large, and this is NOT a large! I ordered the Ladies Large and this is a small. I will not order from here again, as the $7 shipping charge is enough of a lesson for me. If the shirts run small in certain styles, the seller should clearly state it somewhere in their description of the product."
5,"Gene Watson, country music from the heart.","Gene Watson is a balladeer of country and honky tonk music. Gene has always personally selected the songs he records. Lyrics are brought to life with the beautiful voice of a man who truely is, a singer of ballads. Let Gene sing from his heart to yours."
5,ratchet,"I have a small black cat who absolutely loves his KITTYWALK SYSTEM AND KABANA. Most of the people who live in the community walk around every afternoon just to see if he is outside.Once I moved to the city, I thought the cats would have to stay in, but with the KITTYWALK SYSTEM, they spend most of the day outside SAFELY!!"
2,Great idea. POOR execution,I bought the unit to put in my car so that I could stream music wirelessly utilizing the AUX port in my center console. All was well for the first couple of weeks then I began getting occasional drop outs that would last maybe :30 then the music would come back. As time progressed the frequency of the drop outs increased dramatically as well as the length of the drop. I finally returned the product. I will try something else. Maybe I got a defective unit because I bought it refurbished/used. Who knows
1,Losing faith in Motorola,"Despite successfully pairing and configuring the device with my computer, I wasn't able to actually connect to it and use it. A call to their support line only added to my frustration after their automated system only asks for voice prompts but doesn't understand them. After my second attempt at calling them (I was disconnected the first time), the person insisted it was the computer and didn't want to help.Quite a disappointment. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this."
3,Decent enough,"Item operates pretty well once its configured but configuration was a bit more complex than what was described in the setup guide. Overall its a good product for what I wanted to do, which was to connect by Bluetooth headphones to my tv."
4,My Review,"Works as expected. It is small, stands upright with ease and is easy to operate. The only issue that I am experiencing is my Bluetooth RocketFish headset has to be linked almost every time I use it. Good for the price, no range issues, works great."
3,So-so product.,I guess I expected more from Pyrex as I've never had any complaints with one of their products before. These are okay but I wouldn't buy them again. The lids are awkward to get off and the largest lid doesn't fit well at all.
3,lids for pyrex products,"Another review mentioned dissatisfaction with the lids.I too, find the lids difficult to work with. In fact, over the years I have had many bowls with lids and really like the bowls but the lids always were of poorer quality and lasted much shorter periods of time - making the accompanying bowls no longer utile as storage media."
4,devils and nuns,"this is an incredibly fun show, even in its darker later episodes, its impossible not to love these guys, (we especially love greg ayres performance with his oh so manly devil voice), violent nuns, wimpy devil, and the comical pervy scientist with all the answers. theres sooooo much more to this show it's well worth the watch!"
3,Merely an introduction to Networking concepts,"This book mostly explains networking concepts from a point of view of MIS people. I did not find this very useful from a programming concepts point of view, For example book does not explains the fundamental of distributed transactions, concurrency and replication of distributed data. To me it feels like networking concepts and database concepts were merged in one single book. Book in general attempts to covers a wide variety of topics. It is not very useful if you are a serious programmer in Corba or transaction management."
5,A great aid in your computing.,I really love this stand/docking station for my laptop. It has extra USB ports so that you can just leave everything connected when you disconnect the laptop for mobile use.It is an inexpensive way to address the need for both a laptop and a desk top computer. One simple hook-up and the conversion is complete.
2,Not a desk space saver...and it's a hassle,"I bought this item because I wanted my laptop to be off the desk so that my laptop had plenty of air flow which the docking station seemed to do a good job with. I also thought it would save some space on my desk, but it didn't. It seemed to just create more clutter to me and since I was using a desktop keyboard to type on it just seemed to push back my laptop further away from me, which I didn't like. I have a 17"" widescreen Dell Inspirion 9300, and though it did stick out the sides a bit, it wasn't a real bother. Getting the laptop in and out of the thing, was a bit slow..since I was trying to be careful I didn't damage the laptop keys or anything. And though this may be a great tool for others, in the end... I packed the docking station back into its box and just placed my laptop back on the desk. I actually like it better that way now."
2,Don't buy it!,"Well in my case, the USB hub wasn't working. Design is fine but your laptop's temperature will go up (depending on the model)."
3,Great Idea - Improve the USB,"I bought one of these and one without the USB ports. I wish I had purchased two without the USB ports. The ports keep losing my devices, which are a keyboard, a mouse, a printer, and a flash drive. The only way to get them to re-recognize my devices is to unplug them all and rearrange the ports they were in (sometimes several times). The other Kensington laptop holder came as simply a holder. I bought a 4-port USB splitter ($10)to go with it and it works fantastic."
4,Almost as a stationary computer,"Being stiff in my neck after a couple of months using my labtop on a daily basis, I decided to try this docking station - and it really helped! I now manage to have a good and ergonomic posture, combined with the benefits of an extended keyboard. On the negative side, I would prefer a shorter distance to the screen (you have a minimum distance because of the angle needed to have the screen in right position). On my laptop (a powerbook G4), the CD/DCD station is in front, which means that I have to release the labtop from the docking station when I use CDs and DVDs - inconvenient!Though; overall, I am very pleased with this product."
4,Pretty helpful,"A lot cheaper than model-specific docking stations, and 'does what it says on the tin'. Quite stylish too, as docking stations go."
3,Welch's Fruit Snacks - Fruit Punch...,"1. Lest you think I'm biased, I also ordered the BOX of Welch's Fruit Snacks - Mixed Fruit, and loved it!2. I found Welch's Fruit Snacks - Fruit Punch, merely edible. Each package was seemingly 'dry' and 'flat', I won't go as far to say 'stale' (but it does come to mind!).3. It's safe to say that I WON'T order ""Welch's Fruit Snacks - Fruit Punch"" again.I rate this product: 3 stars!"
1,"Very annoying, not worth the money","Its not so much that it was poorly written as it was poorly formatted. Pretty much the whole thing is based on her assumptions of what Scott Petersons personality WAS like at the time or what he might have been like when he was growning up. She supports her facts with some junk about him always being a control freak, yet we never see any real proof of this until he murders his wife? I think I need some hard facts to prove something is real. Whether or not she really wrote each day while it was going on, like she claims, I cant be sure. She seems to repeat a lot of things we already knew. I was so irritated I couldnt even finish. I went back to Amazon and ordered the one Laci Petersons mother wrote. that one is supposed to be the best one. If you are looking for a good read, dont look here"
1,A joke,"The author claims to chat with Laci's ghost while sitting at an apartment complex pool. Laci's ghost, of course, agrees with everything the author says and hates everyone the author hates. Does that apply to the hurricane victims Dillon called cockroaches, hoping that a Biblical flood would kill them all?On top of that, Dillon thinks good writing means cramming every last word from a thesaurus into a single sentence. One cliche after another, and nary a fact to back up any of her fevered imagination.Reading this book was like listening to a drunk, witless boor who has cornered you at a party go on and on about the Peterson case. Dillon's just as tiresome and equally unqualified in any of the areas she tries to write about. She didn't even attend the entire trial. Or interview a single person associated with the case. No wonder she had to self-publish it."
1,Not what I thought it would be,This book is nothing like I thought it would be. It took me a week to get past the 3rd chapter. I'm sure many would like her style but It did nothing for me. I have never seen so many adjectives stuck in a sentence like you will see in this book. It gets extremely annoying.I was hoping for something new and exciting in the book but it left alot to be desired. I guess you never know when it comes to purchasing self published books what you might end up with.
1,I didn't get it,I didn't care for the authors style or her sad attempt at satire humor. I gained no new insight on this murder. It looked just like alot of jibberish. Thanks Julie for letting me borrow it.
5,Sweet Victory!,"The negative reviews from ""readers"" who did not read the book shows that the battle between good and evil is still going on with regard to this case! And what a battle it was!Stone Cold Guilty doesn't just cover the trial and court actions, but it outlines the spiritual warfare between the good guys and the bad guys. The good guys were the prosecution, the Rochas, some of the journalists and the talking heads who told the truth about the trial and didn't bash the People.The bad guys were Scott, Geragos, some of the Peterson family, some of the talking heads, some of the journalists, and an army of anonymous liars who posted on message boards.To read about the great VICTORY of good vs. evil - read Stone Cold Guilty!"
1,"Mulligan not approved, Dillon.","This blook should have a DNR order in the preface, because whoever finds you after you've attempted to read it will need to know your final wishes. Reading this blook put me in a near comatose state due to the wordy and jumbled run on sentences, and overall arrogant tone of the ""author"". I always pass my books on via the unique Book Crossing site drop off service, but I refuse to inflict this horrid blook on anyone else. Mulligan not approved, Dillon."
4,Recommended,"My husband and I were sitting at our kitchen table in San Diego drinking coffee Christmas morning 2002 when we heard about Laci Peterson's disappearance. We both looked at each other and knew something terrible had happened to her.A young wife and mother had died before her time and we wanted justice.Almost two yeas later, we were sitting at a different kitchen table in Texas watching updates of the trial. This case was one that we followed through moves, new jobs and disruption and we missed a lot.I am extremely pleased that this book is available to fill in the blanks. I don't really want to spoil it for others by mentioning all the material here, but this is an amazing body of work. Ms. Dillon has a tendency to be sarcastic and opinionated, but the blog format is a refreshing change from usual true crime layouts. Highly recommended for people interested in the case who had no time to follow it."
1,Horrible,"It is a horrible book it's pretty much just excerts from tv etc it jumps around, I didn't even read it thru don't buy it!"
4,Bettie often fought in heels....,"I followed the Peterson trial on and off, I simply did not have the time to immerse myself in the daily trial proceedings.(...)I have just finished reading Stone Cold Guilty and was blown away by the depth and analysis - It is an EXCELLENT read, especially for those who were a little lost with all the legal wranglings.I recommend it to everyone, and must say the negative reviews here astound me - they can only be people who have not actually read the book and have an issue with the author.Bettie Page"
2,Two stars,Didn't finish it. OK for some I guess. Better than Amber's but that's not saying much. Preferred Crier's by far for interesting detail. This one just wasn't my thing.
1,This is a vanity press offering,"'the whole truth' would be that a publisher wouldn't buy it. This offering isn't fact checked or had benefit of an editor. Much of what is offered here as evidence just isn't evidence. The sonar search and most of what is included as affidavits, interviews or testimony just didn't come into play for the investigation or the trial. It has no relevance to the investigation, the trial or the outcome. Crier's book is the better read for behind the scenes information - that mattered and was taken into consideration at the trial."
1,boo,My opinion of this book is not good. I was offended at her attempt of trying to make light of a dark situation.
1,This is a ghastly book,As much as I tried I could not get passed the 2nd chapter. I think it was written too fast. I will wait for Sharon Rocha's book. I know that will be worth it! And her money will go to a good cause! Not her wallet!
1,Pretty bad,This author I felt was over confident in her writing. I too shared this book. I am glad I did not invest any money in it.I wasted time reading this piece of junk. I wish Amazon had more taste in their books.
1,Disrespectful to the victim,"Another 5 Star reviewer wrote about this book that ""some parts are funny"". This is about a homicide. A beloved daughter, sister and friend brutally taken from this Earth with her unborn baby devastating many lives. This author finds humor, parody and creating 'songs' in this book which I find repulsive. This is a murder and that kind of light treatment of it is completely disrespectful to the memory of Laci Denise Rocha Peterson."
5,A unique perspective on this story,"STONE COLD GUILTY is my first ""blook"" and delivered everything I hoped it would. I may not be the book's intended audience, being perhaps the only reader who didn't follow the case at the time -- though I had trouble keeping names and dates straight in the first few blog entries, I was swept in by the author's style of exposition which includes reflections and daily musings as well as key details absent from the mainstream media reports -- all skillfully supported by exhaustive research. I particularly enjoyed experiencing the saga in the voice of the present-tense; this genre lends itself well to the ""blook"" format. My favorite page was the last, Dillon's impactful poem ""Day of Reckoning."" I'll be keeping an eye out for more of her work in print!"
1,NOT what I'd hoped for,"Having been an avid follower of the trial of Scott Peterson as well as having read all of the books regarding this case that have to date been released, I was thrilled to find this one. This new author is no doubt intelligent. However, I found that Ms. Dillon's book offered much less insight than the others that I have read. Perhaps it was her writing style, but the over use of adjectives and adverbs made for a tedious and at times, boring read. Ms. Dillon's adament attitude of ""having been right"" from the onset and the humor that she attempted to incorporate into the book towards such a tragic subject left me with a less than favorable opinion of her. For verification purposes I shall also add that I am not familiar with her weblog as so many of the reviewers here seem to be.Perhaps some people may find ""Stone Cold Guilty"" a great read but I did not and I regret having purchased and read this book."
2,Unappealing,"A book consisting, in the main, of acerbic commentary from an author who lists no apparent qualifications other than interested observer. There is no meat in this book for the consumer, only acidic fluff. Acidic fluff is best served in small portions with time for the acid to dissipate between bites."
1,Two Thumbs Down,"I was an avid watcher of the Peterson case, and have purchased every book published about it. I sincerely regret wasting so much money and time on this book. It was a very difficult read because it contained many run on sentences and grammatical errors, not to mention many inaccurate statements. I felt compelled to read the entire book because I had spent so much money on it, and kept thinking that it had to get better. Much to my dismay, it only got worse as each chapter passed. I should have listened to the prior reviews of this book, instead of opting to give the book a chance just because it was about the Peterson case. This book did not become part of my permanent collection of Peterson books, and I literally placed it in the green bin with the rest of the recycling the day after I finished reading it. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on this book. If you really feel you must read it, wait to find it at a yard sale or thrift store for a nickel."
5,Stone Cold Guilty is Stone Cold Right ON!,"I have followed this case from the early stages. This is a wonderful chronicling of the events in ""real time"", as they occurred for the general public. The unfolding of this horrific crime was followed closely by media, lawyers, online groups, and the general population. Taking a step back to read all the information, news leaks, hype, gossip, hyperbole, rumor, innuendo (I think I'm running out of adjectives) and see what came to be true, is covered in this tome. Ms. Dillon also added the water search, which was neglected in the trial. It's a great read, and I highly recommend it."
4,Great Book!,"This blogger's point of view is passionate, scathing, and immensely readable. Dillon cuts through the media hype and defense smokescreens with objective clarity. Few of the people involved emerge unbruised. A refreshing, lone voice in the wilderness. Her observations and comments about lawyer incompetence, the media, the justice system, and society in general are bound to ruffle some feathers.Dillon offers an effective comparison of the characteristics of ""narcissists"" with those of Peterson. She gives the reader a pretty convincing portrait that remains consistent when compared to his behavior and ultimate lack of remorse. Super book, highly recommended."
3,Interesting but....,"I found this book to be interesting, while providing additional information regarding the trial and all of the players involved. Having said that, I think a ghost writer would come in handy for Ms. Dillon, the next time she decides to write a book. Besides her obvious hatred of Mark Geragos and his ""grandstanding"", which she mentions on just about every other page, the book is riddled with grammar and punctuation errors. This made the book extremely frustrating to read at times. If you followed the trial and find this case riveting, then you will probably enjoy this book....if you can put aside all the grammar and punctuation problems and keep reading."
1,I fell asleep,I have read Amber and Anne Bird's book on the case and found them a good easy read. This book is not an easy read and rather dull. I am glad I got it shared with me. It also costs way too much for a paperback. I will get Keith Albows. That one sounds pretty good.
4,Short-Listed Best,"Stone Cold Guilty is an in-depth analysis of the Peterson trial and events surrounding the case. The author covers all the issues with candid frankness and sharp wit that eclipses the overblown media and other books on the case.Here the author lays out a compelling two-trip theory supported by the underwater investigation and the computer evidence that was never fleshed out in the trial.Inside you will find a convincing legal, analytical, investigative, and imaginative book that began as a hugely popular web log and has been short-listed for the 2006 ""Blooker Award.""Kudos to the author and I look forward to more from her."
1,The author misleads and speculates,"After reading this blog book filled with the author's rambling erroneous wording and poor sentance structure style, I was ready to demand a refund. She does not inform you upfront that this is a book of her opinions and not just factual case information. She provides no documentation, or other proof when she does state something as factual. I found this book to be a waste of my money and time. There is nothing in it that wasn't all over the news or on the internet. Anyone who followed the case who is looking for anything new will be sorely disappointed.I recommend they keep their money and just browse the internet, or wait for Laci's mother's book which is due out this December."
1,Extremely disappointing,"Fortunately, I bought this book very cheap at a book resale shop for only $1. It actually wasn't even worth that. Some of her facts are wrong, and I think she is completely wrong for ""cashing in"" on this case when she was only an avid follower of the case like so many other thousands of people. Anyone can keep a blog on this case and then incorporate the blog into a book. Since the author is a ""nobody"", I have a low opinion of someone who is an ""average Joe"" trying to make money on a case that was none of her concern personally.I wouldn't waste my time or money on this book. It was very boring to read."
4,Very Satisfying,"Dillon's book was the most satisfying of all. Early books on the case ended at Peterson's arrest where Stone Cold Guilty covers all the courtroom drama from the preliminary hearing, pretrial, trial and sentencing.Less repetition (granted, it was a journal and new information came up) and less arm-chair psychology would have made for a tigher read, but the research was very thorough.Dillon gives Laci Peterson a personal and comassionate treatment.After reading this book nobody would ever question why Peterson was convicted. Stone Cold Guilty and a satisfying read."
1,bait and switch,Wish I could have trudged thru this entire book but it was just too dreary. Have read the other books on this subject so was curious on this one but this bit proved simply too hard to pick up versus put down. Nothing such as described.Many more interesting case books available for half this ridiculous fee.
1,syonr cold gulity,"This book gives a in depth look into scott peterson ., how sad that now one around him could see the real scott, this book takes you to the investigation, and explains how he thought and acted , truly the best in depth book on this case."
1,Save your money,"Don't be fooled by the author's 'bio' - she spent only a single day at the Scott Peterson trial, getting in via public lottery like everyone else.There's no new information or research here. She read the trial transcripts, then posted on her blog throughout the trial. This 'book' is a printout of her blog entries.Dillon is neither a psychologist, criminologist, lawyer or good writer, for that matter, unless you consider the writing on Hallmark cards to be Shakespearean.Also, consider her thoughts on Hurricane Katrina, although she's now deleted them from her blog:""LORETTA DILLON commented:""Unfortunately, I can't see the future. I do know that bad things happen to bad people, and I do wish that the scum of New Orleans had all drowned in the flood, like an Old Testament purge.I expect most of them survived. Like cockroaches.And they are coming to a city near you.""Posted by loretta at September 8, 2005 09:38 AM """
5,Excellent Read!,"I have read every book published on the Peterson case, and this is the best of the bunch. I like the ""as it's happening"" format-it reads like a diary. The writing is excellent, and the author's style flows well. Since I have followed this case closely, errors present in the other books annoyed me- that was not the case here. This book was well researched, well written, and worth every penny. It is the only one on the case that has joined my permanent library."
1,Dull,This book was the most boring EVER! The writer is such a novice. I have seen 8th graders with better term papers.-0
2,Hoped For More,"While I appreciate the effort put into this book, it missed the mark. As the market is saturated with so many different books on this much discussed topic, I was hoping a blogger would come through with something refreshing and innovative. Unfortunately I found the writing style cumbersome at best, and the material was nothing noteworthy."
3,"Where! Oh, Where! are you?","This would be a great book if they told you how to get to these places. You see something you like and don't have a clue how to get there--if you are welcome when you get there, or if it is place that requires admission fees or advance reservations. I really was disappointed.If you just want to read about interesting places, it is fine--but if you want to go there--forget it!"
2,Fossil watch,I received the dead battery edition too.Not a bargain when not in working condition.Better to get one at the mall that works.
3,Also had battery issues; Date feature warning,"Well, I also got a watch that had a battery issue. It wasn't dead but then I realized that it was about to as it started to get slower and slower and then it was hours behind. Amazon was good in giving me a replacement right away.As for the product itself, the date on the bottom is sort of annoying because if it is a month that only has 30 days, you have to remember to move the 31 to 1. It seems to not have a way of knowing what month it is so there are always 31 days in a month on the watch. Otherwise, it is a good looking watch although the strap quality isn't that great. I already have a dark spot on it and I cannot get it off.EDIT: Please don't get this watch. After less than six months, my replacement watch is OFFICIALLY dead. My last watch lasted me 5 years + so this seems to be one defective watch."
3,Oxo Good Grips Wooden Pasta Server,"Not so in love with this one. It does the job, but the prongs are a bit short if you are trying to serve a lot of pasta at once. Still, better than no pasta spoon at all."
3,It Cracks!,"I wanted a wood/bamboo pasta fork and after checking out the reviews for this one and other comparable forks from Mario Batali, Simply Bamboo, Totally Bamboo, and Natural Home, I bought Oxo because no one has mentioned a problem with cracking. Well, there is one now, I'm reporting it. I even conditioned the fork with wood oil twice in two days before I used it. I've had it for about a month and used it no more than 5 times and I noticed the other day that on the side of one of the tines, there is a crack and that tine is separated, however slightly, from the body. The crack extends down the side to the middle of the center, near the hole. What a disappointment this is. I'm still conditioning it with oil in hope of preventing further damage. It's still usable but if the crack continues to extend or there are more cracks appearing, I'm going to complain to Oxo.As for its usability, it's all right. The ""cup"" could be deeper and the tines pointier."
5,Perfect!,I bought this to replace a plastic one that I had come to dread using...the plastic utensil was so difficult to clean! This wooden pasta scoop is sturdy and looks handsome in my utensil holder.
4,Good non-plastic option,"Over the past few years I have made a conscious effort to stop using plastic in the kitchen. I bought this pasta server recently to replace my plastic one. It's great to have a wood option for a pasta spoon since they are so frequently dunked into boiling water... who knows if the plastic ones are safe? Anyway, this spoon is built very sturdy, and I think it will last a long time with good care. My only complaint is that the ""fingers"" are a bit short and wide, so it's not as good at grabbing pasta as my plastic model was. Nevertheless a good choice."
1,????,"This is crap. I thought this was gonna be good because a sticker on the case said it had the ex-drummer from Venom, but that doesn't matter because this is just loud, obnoxious industrial crap. And who would name one of their songs ""White N***** Trash""? I'd even pick Manson over this garbage. Avoid this CD at all costs. 0/10"
5,Unique!,"Dr. Oh's book does provide basic concepts that every pathologist and neurologist should know about nerve biopsy. In fact, this is the only color atlas book available with up-to-date informations regarding nerve biopsy, nerve teasing and semithin sections. It provides comprehensive understanding of the various topics from the nerve biopsy procedure to the interpretation.There is also a clinico-pathological correlation of cases commonly encountered in the clinical practice, which is rarely observed in other books. Language is easy to read. Dr. Oh, with his wide experience, was able to collect hundreds of pictures with varying examples from normal biopsies to the most interesting diseases.Among the various books which attempted to address the same issues, I found Dr Oh's book most informative and clinically oriented. I enjoyed reading it and learned many caveats on the nerve pathology. I strongly recommend it.Laís Regina Rocha de Carvalho,MD Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil"
5,Great Speaker for the right room,"This is a monster of speaker, and I mean that in many ways. First of course is its size, and second of course is its sound, and lastly is its history! This speaker has been in production for 60 years and it as respected today as when it first came out of Hope AK so many years ago.The sound is open, powerful, subtle, moving... in a word...involving. And this can be accomplished with very little power as the speaker is very efficient. If you want loud... look no futher. If you want concert realism look no further...if you have a small room and cant utilize the corners...look elsewhere... sounds best with a very clean signal, so amp and source choice is important, but amp power is not so important.Great for Rock, home theater, and dance music, and very good for everything else. I love to hear Pink Floyd through them as they really bring out the dynamics and energy of the music.The speakers hold up well over time and you can still get parts to rebuild them."
1,uuggghh!,"I remember enjoying campbells manhatten clam chowder when there were clams in it. This current soup had a few little flecks of clams and the rest was a thickened tomato base with mostly potatoes.Oh well,one more product to avoid. With the recent increase in food prices this is not worth one star!"
2,Badly dented cans,"All of the 12 cans had some dents. Several were minor, but fully six of the cans were dented very badly near the bottom seam, and therefore they may not be safe to use. I have noticed dents in several cans from a previous order, but not this many and not this severe. Are the Campbells soup cans that are shipped through Amazon actually retail rejects?"
4,"Sometimes a little too technical, but an effective analysis","Qureshi offers an in-depth analysis of Qawwali music, without ever referring to the ever-popular Nusrat Fateh Ali-Khan. Truly a provokative look at the context, meaning, and structure of Qawwali music and dance performances. At times, however, I felt that the analysis was unnecessarily complicated, constantly referring to the author's complicated (musical notation) field notes, but who am I to criticize the work of an ethnomusicologist. Besides, the only thing I wanted to get out of the book was the context of Qawwali performances, not the precise musical structures of Sufi music.g_money@hotmail.com"
5,The first true feminist reading of the Talmud,"There seems to be a great deal of antagonism between feminists and talmudists. It's refreshing to read a book by someone who is both. The talmud isn't the Misogynistic text some make it out to be, and feminism isn't sacreligious. the two can reside together, and both gain from the proximity. Talmudic study is enlightened by feminist methodolgy and crtique. Feminist studies can learn from the talmud how to deal with a real-politik that is far from perfect. The book is a must for anyone who cares about Judasim in the real-world."
4,A solid survey of astrology,"This book is for you if you want to know more ""nitty-gritty"" information about the chart. There are good, positive descriptions of the 12 signs, houses, and 10 planets. She shows you how a chart is set up and how the planets move around the sky. She gives good, positive descriptions of planetary energy in each sign, and of aspects between planets.I really like her section on the phases of the Moon and the Part of Fortune. She helped me understand how the two are related.My only criticism is of the way this book is arranged. Planets and houses are mixed in with signs, so that Mars goes first (with Aries) and Venus appears in the Taurus section and so on. It can be difficult to quickly find what you're looking for."
3,A fresh approach to astrology,"This book offers an in-depth look at how astrology can enrich our spiritual lives. Lofthus provides a comprehensive study of each sign, ruler and house, as well an a good scientific description of the physical properties of each planet. I found the most valuable part of the book was her summary of the spiritual and karmic aspects in a chart, which offered more specific detail than the average book on astrology. But a warning: Lofthus displays an unpleasantly homophobic streak in characterizing the Plutonian aspects of regeneration: she states that only ""heterosexual sex"" counts as truly regenerative. I'm not gay, but I found this to be highly offensive and bigoted. If you can ignore this one flaw, this is a worthwhile addition to an astrological library."
5,brilliant,"This collection of Haugeland's work just brilliant. The range of topics is amazing, from AI and cognitive science to constitution and existential committment.As usual, Haugeland is both insightful and rigorous, philosophically deep and also humorous. He combines what's best in both the analytical and the phenomenological traditions. This is what a lot more philosophy ought to look like in the coming decades. (Now he needs to give us a book on Heidegger.)"
4,This is not a book to read.,"This is not a book to read, it is really a book to study. Unlike Haugeland`s great ""AI: the very idea"" or ""mind design"", this book carries a deep philosophical tone, and will not be readily understood by the same audience.If you're in for a deep dive down the philosophy of mind, go for it."
1,Stravinsky's revised Soldier's Tale,"For anyone who is familiar with the original version of the suite, this new version with narration will be a major disappointment. Unlike the narration many of us are familiar with in Prokofiev's ""Peter and the Wolf"" which tells the story without significantly interrupting the flow of the music, the narration in this version of ""Soldier's Tale"" is extensive, lengthy and significantly interferes with one's ability to appreciate the music. The original version which is approximately 24 minutes in duration is over 55 minutes with the narration. If I could have returned this, I would have (after the plastic wrap is removed items cannot be returned). This CD is now in my ""do not play"" section."
3,Set your expectation.,"I bought this toy with an educational expectation to my 11 year old daughter, wishing it could stimulate her response and widen her scope of knowledge. This toy was the birthday present to her.It's a competing game that requires extensive knowledge gained as you grow older. So, never mix children with different ages competing in the same game. My elder daughter, aged turning 13, won every time and it frustrated my younger daughter.After the first winner won the game by scoring 10 points, we turned the game set off. The second time we turned the unit back on and played, at least five questions out of 20 were repeated, though not in the same sequence. I was wondering how the 7,200 challenges (as written on the package)could be repeating so soon!The toy chellenges the players' knowledge limited from an American's perspective. There should be an ""International"" version, or localized version for European and Asian countries. It displays English only however."
4,Happy-ish,I find myself using the hammer head alot more than the actual pick end. The hammer is nice for checking structual soundness of rock and really banging nuts out of cracks
4,Wider focus than advertised,"This book does an excellent job at looking at how and why the Navajo Code Talkers were created, but the greater part of the book was descriptions of the battles in which they took part, rather than how the code talkers experienced the battles. I recognize that some description of the battles was necessary for context, but I felt that it overshadowed her emphasis on the code talkers. Despite this, the author's reliance on interviews with code talkers and others who worked with them and her use of first person memories made the book a glimpse into the code talkers view of the war and their part in it. The epilogue, with its look at what happened for the code talkers on their return home and later recognition by the soldiers they served with, was a wonderful wrap up to an important story."
4,Loose on Facts,"This is a fascinating book, reads easily, and is a good introduction to the Navajocode talker program of WWII portrayed by the movie ""The Windtalkers.""Don't take all the facts to the bank. For example, Ms McClain has the""Enola Gay"" and ""Bocks"" Car leaving fron Saipan rather than Tinian and Istill have not found corroboration on her claim of a 1600-B29 firestorm raid onTokyo on August, 13 1945 that she suggests tipped the balance on endingthe war. So read it, enjoy it, but don't use it to set up a bar bet."
5,Great respect and admiration for the Code Talkers.,"Great book, I have met one of the men mentioned in the book, Richard Bonham, he lives about 20 miles from me."
5,"Accessible, entertaining and thought-provoking.","Having no background in philosophy, I found the book to be a fantastic introduction to many concepts and philosophers that had previously intimidated me.Now I can carry on a cocktail party conversation about philosophy!"
3,Make SURE you really want this one,This switch is for only a small incandescent light bulb. The item description is false. If you need a switch for a fan or halogen lights or anything other than a regular old fashioned light bulb get the 20 amp switch 6215M.
5,Great quality that is hard to find from anywere else.,I just love this storage set from Pyrex. The thickness of the glass makes it hard to break. The quality of the lid will never let you food or soup leaks. Nothing will stick to the surface of the container which makes it easy to clean and wash without leaving odors behind. Great for curry storage since it will not leave any smell or color like plastic. Will definitely get another set from Pyrex with bigger size.
3,Whoops! Child-sized storage capacity,"Bought this in a rush off slickdeals.net and didn't take the time to read the dimensions of each piece. This is a very small single-serving sized set. Don't plan on storing much.Quality-wise, it's an excellent product and even had a extra lid. I'd like a more grown-up sized set next time though."
4,Glass beats plastic!,"We've been replacing our plastic storage containers as they wear out, and we're happy to be replacing with glass. Glass lasts longer, doesn't stain, is microwavable and is easily recycled should it ever break. We bought the 10-piece set, and then added a larger rectangle, and additional sets of the small rounds and small rectangles. We use them for storing leftovers in the refrigerator, microwave (you can even microwave with the lid loosely fit if you're heating something that spatters) and in our lunch bags. The lids snap tight, but are reasonably easy to remove. The only negatives are that they're heavy, and you have to be careful with them when they're hot - in particular, don't set them on a cold or wet surface right out of the microwave. This is a great change from the plastic containers we've been using, and we expect they'll last for years!"
2,"good price, but liquid leaks 100%.","very hard to open and close the rubber lid. YET, liquid just leaks like crazy.you just have to think of it as healthy OPEN glass container.works o.k. if only use for solid foods.want to return it, but due to its weight, i think i'll be paying more shipping fee than the original price.glass lock is way better than this.perfect!! seal. and so easy to open and close."
3,ok,the containers are small it would be nice to have al least 1 size bigger then the rest. Kohls had the 16 pz on salle for 27.99 with my 30% off coupon that is a better deal.
4,Great alternative to plastic,"I bought these so I could throw away all of my plastic containers to avoid the chemical leeching into my food and I love them. They get hot when you microwave them and are obviously heavier than plastic would be but if they keep my food safe, that is worth while to me. They are a bargain at this price. I think I will order another set of Pyrex but this time with more circles, the rectangles aren't really that useful to me as most of my leftovers are side dishes instead of full meals. I don't think the lids are really leak proof, I had homemade ice cream in the long rectangle and when it tipped on its side, some of the melted portion ran down the side of the container."
3,Lids lose their seal quickly,"I received two of these as a gift and the lids lost their seal after a year of regular use. I love the bases, though, which are going strong. I store non-liquid leftovers in them and I use them for serving. I use them in the oven too. I don't use them to take leftovers to work for lunch, as the lids come off too easily in my bag."
4,Keep the lids from warping,Great set though smaller in size than I'd have imagined from reading the product page. Very well made and should last a lifetime if you keep the lids out of the microwave and just use plastic wrap in it. The lids of course are'nt as durable as glass and should only be used for storage.Dos'nt stain or smell like plastic and go from freezer to oven to table. Great value.
5,Great stuff!,"Why didn't they come up with these glass storage containers sooner, or if they have been out there a while, why didn't I know about them sooner? All I can say is they work wonderfully. No residual smells or stains, and they clean up very easily. Dumped all my Tupp-Stuff, and went out and bought another set of the Pyrex at my local Tar-Jay.These really do work exactly as advertised...great product!!!"
3,I had to struggle with the lids.,I am really strong and I had to struggle with the lids. Once that hurdle was conquered - the product was okay. But no one should have to waste 20 minutes on a few [stupid] too tight lids on glass bowls. I didn't expect the bowls to be heavy glass by the way. The lids were a nightmare considering the fact that I am VERY HANDY.
3,Very small,I like pyrex for the advantages that glass has over plastic containers. But if you are considering this set please get out a ruler and make sure you are aware how small these are. I bought these as a gift for my mother-in-law and I have to say it was a little embarassing just how small they were when she pulled them out of the box.
5,great for one or two,"these containers are great for one or two people, which suits me fine. in case anyone can't picture the cup sizes i just thought i'd add that the large rectangle is 8.25 X 6.25 X 2"", the smaller rectangle is 7.12 X 5.12 X 1.5"", the larger round is 5.62 X 2.5"" and the smaller round is 4.5 X 2""."
2,Don't put liquid in them!,"I decided it was time to clear out all my mismatched storage containers and bought a few sets of Pyrex...and immediately wished I hadn't! The first thing I used it for was cut veggies and I put some water in with them to keep them fresh. I went to put it in the fridge and the water started pouring out the side! I thought maybe I hadn't closed it right, but sure enough I had and it is just NOT sealed tight! And they are ALL like that!Fine if you want something to just store overnight, but don't expect these to keep food fresh or airtight and certainly don't expect them to hold liquids in!!!"
3,Nice,The containers are great quality. The glass is super thick and sturdy however the covers are almost impossible to fit on top of the containers. I prefer the containers with clip covers. Good for the price.
3,Bummed,I expected them to be a bit larger. I feel as if I didn't get my monies worth. I'm to blame for not studying the measurements but I'm still disappointed in how small they all are.
2,Pyrex storage 10-piece set,"Again, I was so disappointed in the shipping of this product. The one quart bowl had a chip taken out of it on the rim of the bowl. Again, this bowl had to be damaged before it was mailed, because there was no broken glass in the paper that it was wrapped it. Why, someone would ship it in the condition it was in. I didn't mail the package back, it would be more trouble than it was worth. i just threw the bowl out. But I know I won't order any other glass products."
2,hard to get the covers off,"These are very sturdy containers meant to last, but I hate the covers, too hard for my hands to pull off. Opening leftovers becomes a physical battle, Would not order again."
1,shattered pieces,"the containers are nice, however, amazon packed the box poorly and the package came shattered in pieces."
1,Not For Christmas,"Ordered item on Nov 16, 2007. It was in stock then. It is still in stock now. Why is Amazon showing this item will not be delivered until after Christmas? I hate buying anything from Amazon after October. You never know if it will come on time for Christmas or not!"
3,"Bowls are small, can be used to serve to 2 persons MAX",The bowls arrived in a Pyrex cartoon and were very well packed.The bowls themselves are very small and IMO can be used to serve two adults max for one meal.[...]
4,"Nice containers, but bad lids","The glass containers are really good, but the lids became deformed after the first heating."
5,Loved it!,I love pyrex any way buth these containers are great for the left over or carry to work dish!
2,Lids Were Very Poor Quality,"I purchased this Pyrex set thinking they would be similar to an older set of Pyrex I own, and I was wrong. While the glass parts were the same, the lids are much thinner and half of the lids came deformed. I was able to snap the rectangular lids on just fine, but have yet to actually be able to use any of the circular lids.In the future I will purchase any Pyrex physically so I can make sure the lids aren't unusably bad."
4,Glass is so much better,"Made the switch from traditional plastic containers to glass. I got tired of worrying about staining and lingering flavours/smells in my plastic containers. My one little quip about these is that the lids are a little difficult to get on. Once they're on, though, they provide a nice, tight seal."
