1,WARNING: Blu-ray no better picture quality than DVD!,"I actually like this film and have the DVD. I bought the Blu-ray hoping for a nice, high-res transfer, but I compared them side by side and there is NO improvement in picture quality over the DVD! Don't waste your money buying this title on Blu-ray. What a rip!"
2,not so good,"this movie is stupid, why make a movies so dumb like this, oh well can't be perfect at everything."
4,Hartnett is good,"I liked Josh Hartnett in this picture, because he manages to convey his pain at having to be celibate for 40 days so well--he basically looks almost excruciatingly miserable the entire movie. He also projects a certain vulnerability that is sort of appealing, and the way all the hot girls in the office keep throwing themselves at him to try to sabotage his vow of celibacy is pretty funny and of course just puts him in even more pain. His best friend in the movie, unfortunately I don't know the actor's name, but he's the guy with the shock of curly brown hair, from whom Josh keeps finding out all the ways people are trying to sabotage his celibacy vigil/quest, is also pretty good. Good for a bargain matinee at least."
3,Funny...nothing more to it,"If you have nothing else to do, then maybe you can spend some spare time watching this film. This film reinforces the notion how preoccupied men are with sex. Good thing the film was generally funny otherwise all those betting, sex jokes & tempting female co-workers (talk about the devil's temptation)are simply sick & disgusting.I haven't seen Josh Hartnett in Pearl Harbor so I cannot say how good an actor he is. But by judging in this film, he's just an average. He sometimes reminds me of Sylvester Stallone when he speaks. As for Shannyn Sossamon, she's not outstanding either. Nothing in this film required her or allowed her to show off her acting skills. She's just another 'love interest'like in the Knight's Tale."
4,Good Movie,"This movie is definitely worth a watch. The premise and the execution can be corny at times, but the lessons that get through are very interesting and heartfelt. Also, the realism of the movie makes sure that this isn't just a hilarious romp through the idea of sex withdrawal, but actually deals with relationships and problems therein. Overall, the movie definitely hits the intended mark, as long as you can stomach all of the innuendo and sexuality in the piece."
2,Streaming issues,Loved the movie but had problems with the streaming. The movie kept starting and stoping on me was very frustrating.
4,Funny movie,I caught a TV edited version of this on the tube and figured the orginal would be much fiunnier and better.This is a good movie for some entertainment that is funny. Plot may be thin but it was fun to watch.
3,Movie Is Okay,I have to admit I didnt see this film the way some of these reviews' authors saw it. I thought it was relatively funny. Though a good point is made... mentally manipulated into feeling guilty for being raped while asleep... subsequently causing him to apologize. Is rather sickening.
1,Rape!,"What an awful movie. It had an interesting premise that I was eager to enjoy; however the plot was terrible, the characters unlikable, and the rape was ridiculous. Who the hell makes a movie with such horrible people and expects people to like it? The best friend was trash and I was hoping somebody would actually be on Matt's side in all this but no, even Erica the girl he liked was a bitch to him. In the end the movie was just a crude excuse to make sex jokes and went over the top with the rape of the hero who is too stupid to even know he's been violated. What piece of trash! Did I mention there is a rape?"
1,Lame,"Now granted this movie had some very funny parts in it, but the overall picture in my opinion was a giant letdown...To me a good picture has everything, good storyline, ending, etc., and while this movie did a wonderful job of getting you to root for the main character it loses a lot of fizzle at the end. When I got done watching the movie I was rather irritated with the ending (enough to write this review). So, in my opinion save the 2 hours of your time you would spend watching this movie and do something else, anything else. It would have to be better than this movie."
2,Gross Movie,"If you are into gross humar or humar about sex then this movie is for you. I found this movie very weird and gross.Josh Hartnet and Shannyn Sossmen could have done a whole lot better acting jobs than the ones they gave in this movie and from a Knights Tale I expected more from her.If you want a good Josh Hartnet or Shannyn Sossmen film this is not it, you would be better off getting Pearl Harber or a Knights Tale. They are 100% better than this movie"
1,A one-joke movie,"Josh Harnett leads an ensemble cast in this finely nuanced exploration of sexual mores set against the spectacular urban scenery of San Francisco... Harnett gamely mugs through two hours of a single joke: What happens when you practice celibacy for 40 days. The answer is: Not much. The plot has to string this single joke out for an entire movie by predictable gags ... While the exterior shots of San Francisco are lovely, the interiors are some Hollywood designer's idea of what San Francisco looks like--not at all convincing.Anyone over 13 would find this movie sophomoric, and anyone less than 13 shouldn't watch it because of its ""highly sexual themes"" (although there's no nudity and as you would imagine, not much action.) Think ""Week-end at Bernies"" meets ""American Pie"" and you pretty much have the level."
3,Josh Hartnett...,okay...this movie was okay...Josh was SOOOOOOO hot in this movie...the movie was not very good..there were a lot of naked girls...but if u like josh hartnett...he was really fine in this movie...
3,Funny but somewhat of a tired concept,Ok I admit I watched this only because it was set in San Francisco. The premise is good but I really doubt anyone could be that heartbroken that they won't give someone else a chance for an extended period of time. Physical comedy aside the formula is great for the late teens/early 20's set but it fails to have a clear message other than make celibacy one big joke. the acting isn't bad but the story doesn't transition past much else other than cheap jokes.
1,Bad,"Bad flick. It is such a degrading movie, I could puke. I am sick and tired of movies that degrade women! I am absolutely sick of it! Also, this movie is totally racist. The only colored person in the ENTIRE film is Erica, and the Laundry Lady, who is (of course) Asian. It is such a played out, stereotypical, product of a Self-absorbed, patriarchal, Blood-sucking, [caucausian] Dominated, film company!! I am fed up with all this obscenity!"
4,not what i expected,"the movie was good but it was just missing something. i thought they could have made it alot funnier, and i was expecting it to be a lot funnier. its still a fun movie, its just really not funny. its more of a girls movie cuz of josh harnett. if ur not a big josh fan dont expect much from this movie."
5,Josh Hartnett is sooooooooooo hot!,this movie rocked! i loved every minute of it. buy this dvd. NOW! the plot is amazing and funny. it's a great movie all around.
2,Has not helped in getting rid of squirrels in attic:(,"Has not helped in getting rid of squirrels in attic:(. money wasted, reports were false, just a marketing ploy, where has trust & honesty gone?"
3,A renewed mind = A clean heart,"As we prepare ourselves to meet with God through His, word it forces out the old heart patterns/behaviors. This is when the battle between the new & old heart begins. Prophetess Bynum's message gives us additional hope that reinforces the Word.Juanita Bynum's theology is this once you are saved, continue renewing your heart by reading the scripture until the new messages replace the old. At times Dr. Bynum's message comes across as preachy, which I believe is her intent. One of the reasons this avid reader chooses ""Matters of the Heart"" was for its ministry. Open-heart surgery might just be what you need to jump-start your walk of faith.Missy"
5,Want to get rid of the old and look for something new !!!,"In Matters of the Heart. This book alone brings new meaning to heart issues. God allowed this book to minister to me where I was with him and in. It brought new revelation to where my relationship really really was with God. It took so long for me to get out of the first couple of chapters. I promise you - if you are looking to have a changed heart and are looking at having the heart of God please please please read this book, only if this is your season for it. Ask God if this is your season for you to read this book. Be Blessed readers"
1,BOOK CLUB CHOICE,The cost of the product was just right...I bought it for a book club...someone in my family chose the book..I did not read the book I PASSED the book on to ANOTHER person ....It arrived in a timely manner...It looked to be in good shape..but again I personally did not read the book.. I just gave it to another person in the same book club..I will be unavailable for that meeting.. So again I just PASSED it onto another person to READ...Thanks for asking..bye..
2,Power Speaker; but not a Author,"Prophetess Bynum is a powerful woman of God. However, the content of this book was not what I expected. When reading spiritual material, one expects to use the principles learned to apply to their everyday life. There was nothing I could take from this book to help me in my spiritual walk. There were no personal examples that I could learn from or to say, hey...I'm going through this situation now so I know ""This too shall Pass.""She is an excellent speaker but she's not a writer."
3,Very Informative book concerning the spiritual heart,"Juaniita Bynum does an excellent job of linking the physical qualities of the human heart to the spiritual heart. She makes a convincing case that our hearts from the inside out matter. The book is heavy on spiritual matters of the heart, however I did find it difficult at times to understand but her analogies about the problems with the human heart is often most simular to the spiritual heart we battle everyday. If you want to know the root of the matter, get this book for every matter that concerns your heart."
3,This book has some dumb mistakes.,"As climatologists, these guys may very well be brilliant computer scientists and economists. But when they tell me that temperature doesn't measure anything physical, and that the average temperature of two bodies doesn't mean anything, they betray a gross lack of familiarity with basic physics. I DO have a physics degree and thus can see where these guys are talking nonsense, but a lot of lay people will miss it because the writing is so smooth. Take this book with a big grain of salt. Hell, take it with six pounds of rock halite."
4,Full of emotion....a rare find,"When I first opened this book, I was shocked by the images of a bloody nose and a cut eye. But as I perused this book, I relized that all of these photographs showed different sides of childhood. The pain, the joy, and the unadulterated innocence. Sally Mann is truely talented in the art of photography. This book touched my heart like it has never been touched before."
4,"controversial,good photography,a bit disturbing","this is an interesting book of photographs which have been deemed controversial by modern society.mann photographs her children sensitively and you really get to know them through these photographs,in saying that i was surprised the photograph of the wet bed is legal,as it clearly shows the genitals of the child,this is the one photograph i found disturbing.a good book for any art/photography fan."
4,"Beautiful, nostalgic, startlingly honest","Sally Mann's ""Immediate Family"" is startling when you first open it. Not because the children who are so often her subjects are nude much of the time, but because the scenes immediately draw you in and hold you like a feather gripped by a dirty-faced wild child. I grew up in rural Tennessee, and though I didn't have the freedom of the Mann children in some ways,I feel an affinity with them unlike any other children I've seen in these kinds of collections and was instantly transported back to my early years. My favorite pictures are ""Crossed Sticks"", which perfectly depicts the energy and vitality of childhood, and ""Virginia at 3"", which inspires both curiosity and empathy in me whenever I see it. I'm glad someone like Sally Mann is out there to portray childhood honestly and fearlessly, and I will treasure this book."
1,Disturbing,Great photography - bad ethics. Some artists don't think they have a duty to society. I think we do. Art has the power to transform...
1,"Low quality, mulfunction","I bought Waterproof Gyro-G Spot Hydra Vibe Vibrator of this company.The batteries inside the product are old - vibrator hardly vibrates - i was need to install a new batteries. The additional 4 spare butteries inside the package are swollen - out of use.Also I bought Impulse 7X Power because of 3 butteries for 1 motor - it have to be extremely powerful, and 7 vibration modes.I am very DISAPPOINTED of this device - it IS FAULTY. Only 3 vibration modes are working out of 7 and they turned on in random way without pushing the control buttons. The device is DEFECTIVE, this is in its electronics. I already red a review, where customer wrote the same things about another model of such a vibration bullet called Exotics Impulse Pocket Paks.I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN PRODUCTS FROM THIS COMPANY."
2,Another probable boot-leg with no info about tracks or genre,"Why no track listings? Why no information about the musical genre? Is this the genuine label these artists used? Having a serious lack of product info, who would want to buy this? Give us something we can work with here. For any real Moodies fan, it would be a total let down to buy this CD expecting to hear Moody Blues music. It takes a die-hard, hard-core Moody Blues fan to buy something simply based on loving what they did as a group, without any idea of what they were into musically as separate individuals. With no samples to listen to and no track listings on which to base a decision prior to purchase, I will pass. So far, all there is to recommend this is some album art that is nice."
2,"""That don't impress me much.""","I originally purchased this item because I thought it might help with a gut issue and perhaps allergies, as my nose had started running profusely at the time. Admittedly, it did not help with the gut issue because I needed to follow a manufacturer-prescribed regimen, which I was unwilling to. Sorry, feeding my system with that much silver per day was not for me. However, my nose kept running, even after I'd finished the bottle and now I have the first real cold I've had in probably three years. Coincidence? Who cares? It's supposed to be this immune-support hottie and, to repeat, I now have the first real cold I've had in nearly three years. I probably would've been better off not taking it in the first place. To all of those who think this product is the second coming of sliced bread -- woo-hoo for you. Not me."
2,Stick to the original MGM version!!,"All I have to say is, it's a waste of money! The additional new tunes are corny and annoying. Also, the tight, out of control vibrato Broadway voices are nothing compared to Judy Garland. Plus, some of the original songs were cut! I say, take the MGM version, and you won't be disappointed!"
3,Not Like the Current Show,"If you are planning on using this for a source for a staged production, they have changed so many songs from this CD you won't recognize it. It is still lovely music, but many songs in the currently available staged show are not on this."
2,NOODLES HOT AND SPICY,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH IT SOMETHING THATS CHEAP AND LIGHT WEIGHT THE SHIPPING AND HANDLING WAS VERY VERY HIGH. FOR EACH ONE OF THESE EACH. NOW FOR BULK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY FOR HOW MUCH THEY CHARGED. ITS NOT WORTH IT THATS WHY I GAVE IT 2 STARS THE PRODUCT ALONE WAS SO SO BUT TO CHARGE THAT MUCH FOR EACH ONE TO SHIP ITS JUST NOT WORTH IT I COULD HAVE SENT IT IN THE MAIL A HELL OF A LOT CHEAPER. I MEAN THEY DONT WEIGH THAT MUCH.SORRY I WILL NOT BOTHER GETTING ANY MORETHESE WERE A PRESENT I KEPT ONE AND GAVE HIM THE REST HE DID NOT LIKE THEM. SO NO I WILL NOT BE BUYING MORE. THANK YOU
5,Cobalt Peppermill,A kitchen necessity that is beautiful to use and admire. Color is just right for our decor. Thanks.
2,Cheaper just to go to Wegman's or something.,"If you have a nostalgia store (or other shop that might have nostalgia candy), go there. For $18, you don't get a whole lot of candy. Yeah, some of it is really fantastic and delicious, but it seems to have just been repackaged from recent productions of the candy. The box is also somewhat small and contains that crinkle paper confetti stuff for effect (I guess?), but it takes up a lot of space in the box.In all: I wish there was enough candy to justify paying $18 for it, but there really wasn't."
4,Continuing saga of Fiddler and Fiora,"This is one of eight books in the Fiddler and Fiora series. I have just read them all in sequence- and I like every one of them.These are early books by Lowell under her Ann Maxwell pen name, written in conjunction with he husband. Read in sequence, they describe the on again - off again relationship between Fiddler and his ex-wife (but still lover) Fiora. They have the complication of Fiddler's borderline-legal attempts to help peolpe out of trouble, especially in dealing with both white-collar and drug-related criminals.These are very enjoyable short reads."
3,Worth seeing but not worth buying!,"This video should in a lot of senses be revised. It is for the super religious types that just need a tap on the shell. It has some intresting facts but the resources should be shared with the viewer. This video is comprised of taking religious stories from around the globe for centuries and comparing them.How the pieces fit so closely together is a miracle.. (ironic) This video is facts. Nothing more. Yes, its not super quality picture or sound, but the information and resources are excellent(except they don't tell you where to find themselves!) If you look for them you will find them though by doing your own research. I have researched religion for over 5 years. What the NAKED TRUTH says is nothing new, but put into a format the can not be refuted. This video tape puts it on such a low level that even a fourth grader could understand it. Bottom line... I personally have studied and found where the facts have come from, but it is true that the movie does not."
1,Amateurish at best,"I am an atheist interested in the documented history of ancient religions. I thought this presentation might help, but it provides very little.This video is very poorly done. Too much amateurish narration and not enough substantive information about documented evidence. No way of knowing where any of the very limited information comes from, so it's impossible to research. And the title is also misleading. I really didn't need the boring ""sermon"" on the need for me to perfect my spiritual self into a decent human being in relation to ""the creator"", whoever that is.This video provides some explanation for some of the ""evidence"" it portrays instead of allowing the informed viewer to think for him/herself. Isn't that what ""free-thinking"" is all about?And there is a rather lengthy commercial at the end denoting some of the producers other products.I would have given this video Zero stars but I didn't have that option. Save your money on this one."
2,I really like this movie until....,"I really like this movie, until afterward I was researching on Buddhism. And cannot find anywhere that Buddhism makes those claims of Buddha. Nor do they treat him as a god. Buddha isn't at all like how they describe in in this documentary. They do not claim he was born of a virgin, nor do they claim any of the other ""Jesus like"" things. So the lack of understanding of Buddhism really makes me doubt the similarities of other gods and Jesus. With the exception of Horus. As I have read many similarities between Jesus and Horus before watching this documentary. But even then they seemed to be misinformed. As I have read the Ra and Horus were two different gods. But they eventually joined together and became one. I think the documentary is good in that the Bible does take stories that were told before. But it seems to exaggerate on the amount and how similar Jesus was to other gods."
3,"This product provides great information, but useful as a gift","I was a bit disappointed in how this video tends to degrade believers. If it did not do that, then I would buy more and give them to my Christian friends and family. Unfortunately, I would be embarrassed to do that as it is. It has good information and you will likely enjoy it is you are not a Christian."
3,"Haven't read the book, but the Reviews are edifying:",It's interesting to me that the two screaming cultists who dismiss the book can't spell.
1,religious bigotry,"This video could be described the same as many other attempts like it- a vicious diatribe which is severally lacking in scholarship and even containing some outright falsehoods. There are often no citations given and therefore no supposed proof for many contentions. If one is familiar with the subjects presented, one can also know that many of these myths have been refuted long ago. These same attacks have been made for thousands of years now, but the religions it claims to refute are still around strong as ever.It is a shame that people will beleive without question material like this, and assume it is accurate scholarship, and also not realize the authors may have an agenda in mind, i.e. to mask their religious bigotry and rationalize their rejection of religious truth. The world would be better off if you saved the money you would spend on this and give it to a religious charity!"
1,Ordered in November still haven't received in FEB!,I ordered this book to do therapy with my students and now I am over half way through the school year and I have yet to receive this book. I am VERY unhappy with this service.
5,I totally agree with Donald L Graham's review,"I spontaneously enrolled in a Tai Chi Sword class excitedly waiting for the first instruction and when it came it was in Chinese ... ""oops"". It was too beautiful to pass up so I stayed. I frantically looked for instruction, written or otherwise, and when I gambled on this video I was blessed. I was able to keep up with the class because the video was very similar to my instructors' 32 steps except for one additional move. Although I prefer my instructors' style and grace because she looked like she was floating on air, this video helped me complete the course with confidence and most of all - joy."
3,Good Solid book,This book in not bad. It has a solid well written structure to it. The chapters are sequentialy based. But; you can dive into ANY chapter at a moments notice and glean LOTS of information.American readers might get lost with British language & grammar but that is minor.The ONLY drawback is the section on computer graphics. Its obvious this book was written about 4 years ago so the technology HAS changed.Can't wait to read his NEW book on making comics digitally!!!
2,Okay,"This book is helpful for composing scenes and writing a graphic novel, but has almost no helpful information on coloring, drawing, inking, or anything related to the illustration. The author describes styles and methods of coloring, but really doesn't help you at all if you are trying to illustrate your comic. You'll need a different book if you are troubleshooting your drawings or need help to draw.However, it's very useful for pacing, dialogue, exposition, and layout."
3,Not Very Clear,Just bought these phones. Everyone that I have talked to so far has told me that the phone sounds muffled or like I'm talking inside a tunnel or under water. Was surprised to see the good reviews here after my experience. Maybe my phone has newer cheaper electronics? Both handsets on my system are distorted. Will not in basement either.
2,Good company had a bad day,"We bought 2 sets, each for a separate phone line. On about half the calls, we could barely be heard, although we could hear the other party fine. This happened on both lines, all 4 phones.Support was highly accessible (that's why I did not have the heart to give only 1 star) but they could not solve the problem. We followed their advice to eliminate ""interference"", but to no avail.We had to return the units and we installed Panasonic KX-TG2314 units instead. They work great in the same configuration as the Unidens. The Panasonics are much larger but actually more comfortable to handle.Our previous experience with Uniden has been excellent and my guess is that this was just the result of a bad day on the production line. Since we ordered both units together they probably both came from one bad lot."
4,Generally good multiline cordless phone,We have the base and two extension handsets. Sound quality and volume is generally good but still can be distinguished from a basic wired set.My kids like the wide selection of ring tones. Extension-to-extension calling is nice. The speaker phone works well enough for monitoring calls but is not a replacement for a basic speaker phone.One annoyance is that other phones continue to ring for a bit when you answer an extension. Calls without caller ID aren't logged in the call log.
5,Excellent phone.,I have been using this phone for some time now. The reception is great and there is no interference with other 2.4 GHz devices. Sound is excellent and adjustable volume and back light (orange) is additional plus. I love this phone (dual headset).
2,Muffled Sound,I LOVE the features of this phone but everyone I have spoken to have stated I sound like I am speaking under water although I could hear them loud and clear. So I will be returning the phone and my search for a good cordless phone continues.
1,Battery low indicator does not work.,"I would have rated this a 4 until I realized that all three handsets have a flaw. None of the battery level indicators work. That is, they let you know when it's full after first charge but do not lower as the battery power goes down. Also, there is no indication at all prior to the phone going dead during a call. This is a problem on all three of my handsets so it's an issue with all of them or at least a batch. This is very disappointing to me. I'm debating on sending these back but that's such a hassle.. The only way to see the battery level is to unplug the battery and plug it back in. It will then give you and accurate battery level at that instant in time. If you buy these, plan on keeping the handsets on the base to make sure you are always at a good charge before making or taking a call."
4,Excellent-an unprecedented perspective of the unknown.,"David Jinks presents a most fascinating perspective of the potential connections between Mars, UFO's, Physics, Geometry, and strange phenomena which many brush aside. At times, Jinks presents a theory described in overly complicated justification although his concepts may be sound. This is not another quick read, mass paperback on UFO's. Too many other publications have brought skepticism and ridicule.Jinks has authored a piece that is scientific while still addressing commonly known ""events"" such as Roswell, crop circles, and the mystery of the pyramids. A credible work by Jinks, this deserves to be read by those interested or fascinated by the unexplained as well as by stoic scientists who search for truth but only under a microscope. To those encountering difficulty with the geometry and physics - skip over it - and continue to read the Monkey and the Terahedron with unbias."
5,turbulance on the ground,"What a delightful and entertaining book with heart and love for people, Panam and those that gave their best to the international air travel public. Ed was a fellow employee and loved Panam, as did I, and many thousands of other Panamers. Humerous,yet at times, quite profound with excellent psychological insight into human relations, Ed understands the wider importance of air travel, which has brought many people from all over the world together for better understanding and appreciation, but makes no excuses for those who violate these principals. Read it and love it! You can finish it over a long flight and a delay or two!"
5,A nostalgic flight out of the past!,"Having been in the airline industry myself many years ago, reading this book gave me a lot of humorous moments recalling life in the air and on the ground. This is well written and I enjoyed it very much!"
3,Puff piece or investment primer?,"While this certainly isn't the worst book I've come across about investing, it didn't blow me away either. I call it a ""puff piece"" because each investment topic is treated to a single page of commentary, sometimes two. This is a nice book for the novice investor, but for someone who has already read dozens of books and gone into depth with investment theories from various successful investors, this one has no teeth. However, since this book covers all markets and not just stocks, I did find some useful tidbits of information, such as the author's guidance on buying bonds. Not being very well versed in the bond market, I found his guidance helpful. In summary, I would recommend this to someone who needs a general primer for investing, or who would like an overall perspective on the markets (currency, bond, commodities, options, and stocks) in general."
5,"Stock market wisdom, in a nutshell","If I were to own only one stock investment book, I would choose this one."
4,Things To Be Learned,"This is a book on the stock market told from an insiders view. It covers many different subjects on the overall stock market. It is a book of wisdom from someone who has been there and made it on the street. You will not learn how to read charts or figure out how to calculate moving averages by reading this book, but there are lessons to be learned. It could take years before the lessons are understood."
1,"Bulls/Bears make money, the authors should not have","Read instead Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, ISBN: 0471059706"
3,Good documentary of Saturn program,"I'm an apollo nut and very much into the technical details of the program. This book is a good overview of the Saturn project and an excellent place to start if you are just beginning your adventure into history.However I found the book to be lacking in detail when it comes to specific technological problems and how they were solved. One has to go to the more detailed sources (NASA press kits, 1st-person accounts, etc.) for the good stuff.The book is written in dry, documentary fashion. It is factual (a NASA publication) but not an entertaining read.Again, an excellent source for facts, figures and an complete overview of the massive project that is Saturn."
5,Excellant documentary,Not for the light reader. A very well done complete guide to the development of the world's most powerful launch vehicle.
2,Unreadably boring,"I've enjoyed dozens of fine books on the Apollo program. Murray's ""Apollo"" was my favorite, for all of its inside technical info. I had hoped this would be more of the same, including expanding on the fascinating technology of the Saturn engines, and the obstacles the engineers overcame.Instead, it reads like a boring engineering document dump, with no narrative. I found myself skipping chunks of text, hoping to find the ""interesting"" stuff. It never materialized.As a degreed engineer, I can handle geeky tech talk, and I reveled in it when fascinatingly delivered by Murray. I also enjoyed the Gene Kranz book, which gave insights (especially project management and personnel issues) I had not learned in countless other books on the topic.Unless you are looking for dry, exhaustive archives of facts without any real context or narrative, skip this one."
4,Gives One an Idea of The Scope of This Program,"This is the best attempt I've seen for an accounting of the Saturn Program(s). The enormity of planning, building and deploying the Saturn series was so great that one could make a career as a historian on this program alone. This not light reading and some base knowledge of rocketry helps.The author does a great job of delivering the technical and program management side of Saturn and gives us enough juice on some of the key players to add some entertainment value. The selection of graphics and photos could be improved - there are a lot better ones available in the public domain. I struggled a bit with his technical description of the F1 engine and referenced schematic until I pulled a photo off of Nasa's Web site that made it much clearer.If your a fan of the US effort to put man on the moon buy this book and add it to you collection."
1,"Loud static, unrecognizable voices, bulky handset","For starters, I have no hearing impairment. I purchased this for my mother-in-law who has very poor hearing. I tested it before giving it to her, and promptly returned it to Amazon.There are loud, cyclical static blasts when the phone is in use, even without using the DEAFENING burst feature. I tried (unsuccessfully) changing channels and adjusting the tone and volume to correct this issue. Voices, including my own, sounded tinny and barely recognizable. There is a faint echo of my own voice, and sometimes of the person whom I have called. Very unpleasant to use....The phone is very bulky and heavy.The good things: the ability to change tones for different frequency losses is nice, the numbers are HUGE and brightly illuminated, and when it rings, the handset and base have very obvious strobing red lights.Save your money. Buy something else."
2,Too bad!,"Deborah Coleman is a great guitarist. Whatever people like Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Albert Collins or Albert King had that made then great blues guitarists, Deborah Coleman has. I could listen to her guitar licks all day, and her guitar licks on this CD are great. Unfortunately the rest of it is very pedestrian. Coleman has a great voice, but the musicality of the vocals is very ordinary commercial pop style.The songs are mostly what sounds to me like a trendy jazzy style. The bass line is particularly annoying throughout; it is loud and it is irritating. I don't want to hear the bass line, I want to hear the lead guitar!"
3,Vintage Guitar Magazine Says...,"Deborah Coleman just may be the hottest thing going in the blues world today. Her first Blind Pig CD, I Can't Lose, was chock full of refined guitarwork, emotional vocals, and well-crafted songs written by Coleman herself. Where Blue Begins is more of a good thing. On this new CD, Coleman is backed by the James Solberg Band, Luther Allison's former U.S. touring and recording group. As might be expected, Coleman's sound on this disc is thus even rougher and tougher, streaked with a rock'n'roll edge. Joanna Connor adds her typical brand of raucous slide guitar on one cut. The majority of the cuts here are Coleman originals, and these songs shine above the handful of covers. Coleman can craft a fine blues tune---and then back it up with sweet guitar playing. Crown her the new queen of the blues."
4,Great self-help book,"This book helps couples get along without their inner selves being buried. It helps couples show their emotions without being angry or ashamed. Quizzes and such are included to help you learn and practice ways to improve yourself and your relationship.Even though the relationship between me and my husband is great, this book helped me realize I could enrich it. Just by taking the quizzes, I learned a lot about myself. The author gave me good ideas about dealing with stress and how to release my anger. If you do not think you need advice about your relationship, this book could still help you make the most of it!"
3,Newcomer,"I gave this 3 stars because I needed a game to get my son started on games on the computer and I feel at this price I can't lose. He wanted a game on racing and after I saw this one I felt I found one he would enjoy. Who knows, it may deserve 5 stars. Thank you."
4,"Excellent Lunchbox, Not-So-Excellent Thermos","This lunchbox is sturdy and is the standard lunchbox size (not a trinket or ""treasure"" box). My 8-year-old daughter takes this to school everyday and it has held up great. She loves the graphics and we have never seen another lunchbox like this in a store. However, the thermos leaks so we do not use it. Other than the shoddy thermos, we love this lunchbox."
2,Not compatible with all V-series phones,"I purchased the Technocel Antenna hoping to get better receiption when using my Motorola V600 cellphone. Unfortunately, they don't mention that this antenna *is not* compatible with the V600 phone. If you purchase this for a V-series phone, be prepared to roll the dice if it'll truly be compatible with your phone or not."
4,Good Album,"These guys have superior Christian lyrics, and their music is really interesting. It is kind of a mix between ska and punk and even a little rap. It's definitely worth listening to. 4 stars."
1,Okay seriously....,"This CD really is terrible. I bought their second album ""VEGAS CAR CHASERS"" and I really enjoyed it, it was genuinely good, had a really unique sound, so I figured maybe their first album was as good...They sound like a local ska band, and nothing is special about it. Unless you enjoy crappy ska music, or you like songs just cause they have funny lyrics (meaning they don't actually have to sound good) this is the CD for you. If you enjoy a CD where they sound like a real band, and not like everyone else, pick up VEGAS CAR CHASERS."
1,THIS CD STINKS!,"I'm sorry, but i think that this cd is awful. i cant believe someone would even release a debut cd this bad. almost every song sounds the same as the last one and there is no point of understanding for majority of the songs on this disc. if anything, buy this cd used!"
4,A good one for sure,"If your a strategy lover, this is a game you should put on your shelves. Featuring three balanced races, colonies you can both capture and use, and a great storyline, its a must have.Its a bit tricky to learn the ropes, but once you get the hang of it, it can be one of the best experiences youve ever had. The races are balanced, and the campaign isnt too hard (but not obnoxiously easy, either)Plenty of units (both race specific and neutrals). I strongly urge you to give this game a shot. And nowadays, its not entirely expensive either."
5,No one can use words like Kahlil Gibran,"Kahlil Gibran leaves me breathless with every book I've ever read from his collection of poetry, love letters, short stories.. etc. I have absolutely fallen in love with him, and am sure that he is one of the greatest men to have ever lived. His mind will boggle yours with his words of love, encouragement, many other things (read The Prophet). I really don't know what much else to say other than there is nothing better than a good Kahlil Gibran book, because all his books are good. Better than good, they are the best. Enjoy him! I have, and will forever more."
4,Not by Gibran,"I found this book a fascinating history of the life of Gibran. It talks about his early youth in Lebanon, his immigrating to New York and of the writings he did in both English and Lebanese. While I found the book an interesting read, liberally sprinkled with quotes from his works, it was not at all what I expected when I ordered it. The Amazon page implies this is a book written by Gibran, which it is not."
3,"2 Discs, Same Tracks",Very strange. I purchased a used copy and I put in the disc labled DISC 1 and it has the 8 tracks from DISC 2. DISC 2 has the correct tracks. Anyone else get this?
3,"Okay, It's Not THAT Great!","I honestly didn't think this album was that good. I'm usually a tough critic when starting with a new band, but I just didn't really like this album. Not much more I can say. I bought ""In Between Then and Now,"" and THAT is a great CD. Stick with that one, especially if you're new to this band."
5,"Pure Music, Pure Sound, Pure Genius","I love live albums. There's nothing better than listening to your favorite band play your favorite songs, and be accompanied with thousands of screaming fans. Lately, I haven't been able to find a good live album, until now. O.A.R.'s music is undeniabley great, and this live album captivates all of it. From the opening lyrics of ""City On Down,"" to the yells of emotion in ""I Feel Home,"" this album will definately touch you in one way or another. A definite recommendation to any O.A.R. fan, or anyone who just likes good music."
4,O.A.R. on a Solid Jam,"I heard several songs from this live collection in a clothing store, and the tunes were extremely upbeat and captivating. Based on that feeling, I ordered this CD set from Amazon, and my actions were well vindicated. The band is excellent in the live environment, offering a wide variety of songs. Their presentation and music style is somewhat reminiscent of the Dave Matthews Band, and yet just different enough in a raw, hungrier, and new way. They are definitely in ther element as a solid jam band, and I could not help but feeling that I would really like to catch them in concert when they come around. The CD is a big hit at my parties, and elevates all into the good fellin' groove. I recommend this CD collection 100%."
3,Not enough Lone Star,"This band seems to be a big hit with the college frat crowd, who can sing most of the words while sloshing around a few cases of Lone Star. Personally, I found most of it repetitive and the sax work very plodding and predictable."
3,This Is NOT 5 Stars(and not on the level of DMB),"These guys try hard but really dissapointed me. They pretty much rip off DMB a lot throughout the CD( the beginning of Get Away, all of the sax, and at times the drums). The lyrics sound like a bunch of catch phrases thrown together with too much emphasis on rhyme. The reggae attempts are also pretty weak and especially the ""reggae"" lyrics. Also what is the ""revolution""(since their name stands for Of a Revolution)? It's not in the music. They sort of go back and forth between a DmB rip off and a local bar reggae attempt. Again, they try hard, so let's give them credit for that. I'm sorry if I ripped your band but I'm just being honest. It's not right to give them 5Stars just because you really like them and they were your first concert and you had your first beer and all that stuff. Let's be realistic. And if you're thinking of buying it, don't expect a lot."
1,"Uh, hello? O.A.Rrrrrrr. Duhhh...","You people that are all dissing OAR just don't get it. I mean, gah, you just DON'T GET IT. These guys names's are Of A Revolution, not like the boating instrument. And they write a song about their friend who killed himself, I mean, that's deep. You have to realize that these guys are writing about deep things like their friends, and their hypnotic grooves and mesmerizing freak-out jams are what attract their massive audience. Dammit, I just wish you people held under the sway of corporate radio rock, in your suits and ties, and briefcases would just take a second to look out of your cubicle and see O.A.R. rocking your hearts. AGGH!"
5,O.A.R.,"I'd only heard O.A.R. a few times before I went and saw them in concert... but as soon as I heard them I loved them. I bought this live cd at the concert. All my friends wanted it too. Everyone who has listened to the cd has loved it. ""that was a crazy game of poker"" gets stuck in people's heads. We listened to that song the entire way back from the concert. I recommend this cd to everyone. After you hear it once or twice, you'll have it on repeat for weeks. O.A.R. is great in concert and this CD captures that. You'll be singing ""poker"" for weeks... This CD is great for anyone looking for a new sound, b/c O.A.R. definatly has a different sound than all those other bands."
1,Definitely NOT worthy of Wilbur Smith or the actors,"I'm a Wilbur Smith fan, so I bought this DVD thinking it would be interesting...silly me...are movies EVER comparable to the books? Despite the excellent cast, the acting was third rate and the movie came across as sort of Danielle Steelish, not Wilbur Smith. Given the talent involved in the film, the film makers could have done MUCH better!"
2,Ok for a rainy day,Bought DVD mainly cos am a Alyssa Milano fan but to be honest she was completely wasted in this film. Quite a good story but seemed to have a really rushed ending. Probably an ok television movie to watch on a rainy day and worth getting just to have a laugh at the acting from the guy who plays Benedict. If your an Alyssa fan stick with Charmed.
1,Nap Time,"It has been years since I fell asleep while while watching a movie for the first time, but I found ""The Diamond Hunters"" a very pleasant nap. I enjoyed my dreams much more than the movie."
3,Hit and Miss for the D.E.,"I am a really big fan of First Degree but I gotta say: This album is very uneven. Some of the tracks (Watching My Life Go, The Jabberwalky) are really good. On par with some of his best. But others are throw away tracks. I would still recommend purchasing because the D.E. is so unique, you aren't gonna hear anything like this anywhere else. With that said, I still like the album. A must buy for fans of the D.E. but those coming in fresh might want to start with something else like ""Planet Zero"" or ""Damn That D.E."" All praise to the Fahrenheit Shlangz!"
4,Caribbean Steeldrums>20 most popular melodies,"Steeldrums are one of the most original things in the Caribbean Islands. The melodies were well chosen. Unfortunately these instruments are not well known around the world, the sound is refreshing and nice to listen to"
5,Take me to the Virgin Islands!,Every time I hear this album I start checking my winter calender for a visit to the Virgin Islands. Briing out the planter's punch and bring on Caribbean Steeldrums!
1,Where's My Order ?,"I ordered this May 20, 2005 and even at June 14, I still have not received it.I'm wondering about the reliability of this shipper."
5,CARRIBEAN STEEL DRUMS:20 MOST POPULAR MELODIES,"Do you want to relax and just take your mind off things,then just listen to this CD, It will just blow you away,GUARANTEED--you will get addicted,you won't regret it,just make sure you have a good STEREO,Otherwise you won't hear those reverberating sounds of those steel drums--this CD Deserves TEN STARS PLUS----"
4,A pleasant escape,"This disc is a lot of fun, and a bit of a lark. Is it serious music? No -- but you're not buying it for seriousness! It's maybe a bit more background music than I'd like, but it certainly whisks you away and sets a fun mood. The song selection is a hoot -- everything from what you'd expect to covers of the Gypsy Kings. The musicianship is top-notch, and the one-man-band approach doesn't provide much spark, but it's also not a detriment."
5,Caribbean Steeldrums: 20 Most Popular Melodies,"This CD was very interesting and enjoyable to listen. I would not have found it locally, but was able to purchase it on Amazon with little effort. The sounds of the steel drums brought back many Caribbean memories."
3,Boring,"Is this beginning steel drum? Where's the passion, soul and sophistication of blood stirring steel drum? This is steel drum elevator music."
3,Music is a Little Muddled,"Some very nice songs and beautiful sounds. Music is basically very nice but the background steel drum (drums?) seem to wander around. Instead of harmony or counterpoint, quite often it just sounds like some kind of improvisation that just muddies up the beauty of the musical performance. Not really exciting party type music but some good music."
4,FOBUS LEG RIG,"Love the Leg Rig, right now looking for another Fobus BRV body so I don't have to keep taking my hip holster apart.NOTE: I most likely will change out Thigh Strap to a wider or may have to Custom make the strap for better rigidity.Over all great Idea Love the product"
2,The Gods of Mars,The production and reading of this book are not good. There are frequent unexplained pauses. The reader attempting various voices is frequently difficult to understand.
5,Emergency!: Season 6,I have got season 1 right through to season 6.Number 6 is great. Can not wait for the final season (Season 7) to come out & make my collection.Amazon you are doing a good job of getting my orders to me (Australia) in record time.Keep up with the great work. Peter Stubbs.
5,Went out with a bang,"Okay, perhaps not technically the last season, as there were some TV movies later on. But still, this was basically the last full season and in a lot of ways, it's the best.No, probably not in the rescues and action. Indeed, they seem to have run out of ideas, repeating some things from earlier episodes.But there is just a sense of fun. Most of the focus on this season is with the firemen, not the Hospital. So with the added time and emphasis, you get more about them. Including the captain's descent into paranoia about the new Fire Chief (which doesn't sound funny, but is hilarious in practice), to a episode where much of it is about the guys playing in a basketball game (again, amusingly, Chet turns out to be their secret weapon).It's probably not for people who aren't fans of the show, but if you ever loved this show, then this season is a must buy."
5,emergency,"another super program ahead of its time.Great acting,very real,the charactors Gage and De soto,kept this show alive and worth watching for years,they should of made more of them.JL"
5,Awesome,It is wonderful to be able to watch my favorite show from when I was growing up I will be watching it for years to come.
4,Emergency Season Six.,"This is my least favorite season. I still liked the chemistry between Randy and Kevin and the show still lured me back every Saturday night but, viewing the DVD's now, I see that both actors seemed to be running out of steam and just seemed tired. Randy needed ro comb his hair and Kevin just looked like he wanted to be somewhere else. But it still had some good episodes, especially Fair Fight and Welcome to Santa Rosa County. I still recommend it because the magic, while showing it's age, was still there."
5,Good price,I bought these as soon as the price went down. I am very pleased with my purchase. I would recommend to friends and family.
4,Jonesing for Tom,"Well, after the pop heaven of Mr. Jones on RELOAD, here we go again! Some of the best in R&B get the Jonesy treatment. If it were not for the fact that the songs were so good, we might think that Mr. Jones was in Love with his own celebrity. I guess it's a good thing he's a real artist and knows what his audiences want--more Tom Jones, no matter the material."
1,Grateful Dud,This is the most pathetic excuse for a piece of jewellery I think I've ever seen. The blurb says it's a good size for men. What kind? 3 feet tall pygmies? I tried it on and only just got it on my little finger. The photo that accompanies the Amazon blurb does not show that the skull is completely hollow. This gets my vote in the Bernie Maddof Awards for Integrity in Product Credibility. Minus 10 stars. Junk.
1,Poorly scanned copy of a public library score,"I was very disappointed to see that this score was a poorly scanned copy of a library score.Shame on the ""seller"". I expected better oversight of third party vendors from Amazon."
5,"Mm heh, heh heh heh..... ummmm...... good.. mm heh","I liked this book. It combines two great things (huh huh huh, you said things), Science Fiction, and Beavis and Butt-head."
5,Unavailable locally so I tried Amazon,"My wife and I had been enjoying these noodles for years but they had become increasingly difficult to find. One after another the sources dried up so we tried Amazon. Lo and behold there they were. Even the manufacturer couldn't figure out how to allow us to get some through the mail. A little high for shipping but cheaper than a 200 mile round trip to Los Angeles at $4.00 a gallon + for gas. Thanks Amazon. Oh by the way the noodles are very tasty, good with chicken broth, crispy chunks of pork, halved hard boiled eggs and soy sauce to taste. Yum!"
4,Weird collection of songs,"It looks like someone got the order to put together rock music with women in it. Preferably music they had rights to. And then tossed this little thing together. Sounds grim, right? But somehow the result is better than anyone would predict. Good songs, randomly arranged, and I found a couple of new bands (well, new to me) to explore further. A great example of an inexpensive sampler being successful. Heck, ignore the ""Grrrl Power"" and embarrassing covers and be happy with the music."
4,A Sparkler for all Seasons!,"""The Fantasticks"" remains fantastic. This is the simplest of musical plays and continues to play somewhere on the globe every day of the year....for very good reason: it radiates joy. This 1993 recording captures all the fizz and zest and tenderness and metaphor of the original cast recording and magnifies everything so that the piece holds even more joy. A thoroughly refreshing revisit with an old friend. It keeps us young!"
3,"Nice, But With Problems","I agree with those who complain of the casting in this particular production....El Gallo particularly. But what seriously harms the production is the change of the original libretto. In ""Rape,"" for example, the word ""rape"" is almost always changed, as sung here, to ""abduction."" It sounds weird. And this, from a musical which has more pure poetic imagery than any other. What can be lovlier than: ""...try to see it. Not with your eyes, for they are wise; but see it with your ears - the cool green breathing of the leaves. And hear it with the inside of your hand. The soundless sound of shadows flicking light...?"" What happened to Jones and Schmidt? ""Colette Collage"" is barely worth a listen. Same for ""I do! I Do!."" ""Roadside"" tries, but fails. Only ""110 In The Shade"" comes close to the excellence of ""Fantasticks."""
2,"Lazy, standard treatments","What an uber-genius idea: Kraftwerk comes out of retirement to record the theme music for Expo 2000 in Germany. Alas, the inspired commission yeilds lame-o results. No matter. Let's give it to cool producers/DJ's and watch how they make everything better! Can you imagine getting the call? Kraftwerk! The grampas of electronica-techno-dance, etc., asked ME to remix their single! You'd think these guys might have a sense of occasion. Judging by the results--nope. Lazy, standard treatments are applied across the board. Did anyone slave over these? Old-school nod Orbital churns out a happy ditty that goes nowhere fast. Rolando tosses off an FM Radio dud. FK + RR start out on a sea of mellow-cool only sink off the shores of Dullsville. How did this happen? A very disappointing effort. I'd like to say you need this CD from an athropological point of view, but I'm not so sure."
3,I expected more...,"from a band I have followed since I was in junior high school. The song is OK, but as stated before, I find the remixes uninspired and disappointing. I guess I expected too much after 15 years. I can stomach it more now, but when I first listened to this disk all the way though the words ""this sucks"" entered my mind. I couldn't believe the equivalent of electronic noodling would be put on a disk. I give this disk 3 stars only because of who they are and out of respect. I am also a completist. I would not recommend this disk to the casual fan, but only for the true die hards."
3,A deserving companion for the expo2000 single,"The best thing about this release is that it achieves enhancing the listening experience by creating more dynamics for the original version.This single serves for the most part a platform for Underground Resistance lable, fans of minimal or even IDM may get the most enjoment out of this release, however the rest of us may find the majority of this single difficult and too challenging although it is a deserving companion to the expo2000 single. The real winner here is the Francois K. and Rob's club/dance rendering whilst Orbital provides us with the most accessible standard fair to the casual listener the remaining mixes besides the last track in my opinion often seem to be missing texture, it would have great to hear more remixes from different remixers, this is far from being Kraftwerk's most accomplish material but it's nice hear something after a 13 year hiatus even if it is a little dissappointing."
2,Two short stories,"The paperback is actually two short stories. The first short story is ""Guns of Fury"" (originally written in 1933 as ""The Hour of Fury""). The second short story is ""Night Raid"" (originally written in 1929). Both stories were flowery prose without alot of substance."
1,Not a unique style,"He plays well, but nothing that sends chills like the legends. Not a Musselwhite, Walter, Lester, Reed, Pryor. He probably was OK in his day, but nothing great. Buy a Jason Ricci and crank it up."
1,Extremely low quality,"I have had this fixture on my ceiling for 18 months now. For the first 9 months or so it seemed fine. Then the shades starting slipping off because the threads holding them on are shoddy. Then the lights started to sizzle (yep, sizzle, as if they are about to burst into flame). Then, lights started to go out. Then come back on. Then dim. Then brighten. Then die completely. Out of six lamps, two are completely dead, two will work only when aimed directly at the wall (I'm trying to light a desk, so that's sub-optimal), and two seem to be holding out so far. I will never buy another Kovacs fixture again."
3,Decent but not as shown,"Keyboard was supposed to have the extended piece for the bottom of your hand to rest on but didnt. Others said their keyboard had IBM on it, mine didnt have the brand in the picture or IBM so it looks like they are just shipping random cheap keyboards.Dont trust AMAZON with this product unless you just need it for a CLI linux box like me!"
5,The Silent Type,"No problems here, except in purchasing from Amazon affiliated vendors in other transactions, I find the sellers very communication proactive.I never heard a peep from this vendor and really, in the most basic sense, had no idea as to whether the order had even been confirmed. Only Amazon's order status page assured me this was at least in the system.However, the item arrived in perfect condition under the time allotment so technically I have no complaint. I will say I have been spoiled by other Amazon vendors."
2,"Blue Blood, True Blood; Conflict & Creation",First hundred and twenty five pages were great. The rest of the book was just filler.
3,Falling Short,"The radical subject becomes believable under this author's pen, even though not much is new except for some detail on subjects found in other writings. However, midway through his work, the author loses his way and meanders, without apparent rhyme or reason, into misadventures with a nefarious female who is his nemesis, a demon, karma, or more. This aside may be pertinent, but the author does not demonstrate its pertinence and the digression spoils much of my initial favorable impression. I wish I knew what the author was trying to say about this involvement. The excerpts at the back of the book were enlightening and well-reasoned. This author thinks clearly. Overall, the book did not live up to expectations but may direct me to the secondary author's work."
4,Trying to understand,"I just finished reading this book. I already had read several books from Sylvia Browne about some of the same similar events. So it was fascinating to learn there is more than one person who has the same theories. Since this is so, it helped me to believe even more. I am new to this ""demension"". I have lived under this happy vail of a cartoon world. Now things are starting to make sense. I also do wish Stewart would elaborated more and was a better writer but he got the point across even if it was crass. I am still not sure if that afair was due to the ""drugs and programming"" or an excuse to fool around. Hahaa!! Doesn't matter, I loved the book. I am excited to read more."
5,Incredible True Story,"In my opinion, Stewart Swerdlow is one of the most brilliant men on earth at this time. What a great man, and a brave man, to tell his story and spend his life trying to help others defeat the evil men who are attempting to bring in the NWO.His story is fascinating and at times unbelievable, but so much of it is coming to pass just as he was told it would.A must read!!!"
4,Sweet and Fun,"There are four short stories in this Dav Pilkey book. The stories have winter and Christmas themes, and the book would be a good choice for reading aloud during book-time, or for practice reading for those reading above grade. (The writing is at the 3rd grade level.)(spoilers)In the first story sweet Dragon find the perfect tree but can't bring himself to cut it down. While the second and third stories deal with mittens and a delicious candy wreath.The final story is about the true spirit of Christmas. Dragon goes out to purchase himself all sorts of goodies, but by the time he gets home, he has nothing. You see, he found all sorts of people who needed them more.(if you need it, there's more info at my 'lists' site)Pam T~"
5,Adorable and joyful!,"I might have been tempted to give this book 4 1/2 stars, simply because there wasn't as much of a thread running through the chapters as I would have liked - but, it was so gosh darn cute that I didn't really care! (Okay, and I was thinking it was a dinosaur, for some reason, instead of a dragon, but that's really minor ;> )I completely enjoyed this adorable story about a sweet dragon preparing for Christmas. If the last page/illustration does just warm your heart, I'm not sure what will. :)A very easy reader broken into ""chapters,"" our Dragon goes through various events which demonstrate: the beauty of living things, the side-effects of greed, the issues with forgetfulness, and the joy of sharing. These ""messages"" all done in a funny or sweet way and are quite subtle and simply unfold with the story.The illustrations are delightful and perfectly complementary to the text! I definitely give this a huge recommendation!! :D"
1,Good job of exploitation Mr Berg!!,"I came accross Scott Berg's book several years ago on the bargin table at Walmart. I should have left it there. Katharine Hepburn could not possibly be less than interesting, but I had to really work to finish this book. The book was more about the author and his agenda than the woman he called his friend. I found a man with a very big ego giving a less than flattering portrait of someone who he said was his friend. My impression of the author based on this book is that he was very good at exploiting his friend Katharine Hepburn. I hope I never have a friend like Scott Berg. Where I come from, friends protect and emphasize the positive qualities. For a loving look at Katherine Hepburn I would recommendAt Home with Kate: Growing up in Katharine Hepburn's HouseholdIt was written with love."
2,Yawn,Kate Remembered is more of the autobiography of interviewer A. Scott Berg than it is a biography of Katharine Hepburn. I get the impression that she gave him the run around in their so-called interviews and he didn't have enough to write a proper biography. Rather than strain himself with research he chose to write the book about his many travels to Hepburn's house and of course his glorious career as a writer and his life long love of the actress.
4,A special book about a special lady,"In the preface to this book, Scott Berg makes it very clear that this is not a biography in the true sense of the word. Certainly it's not a biography when you compare it with his incredible book about Charles Lindbergh. But it does deal (in brief) with the life of Katharine Hepburn, one of the most remarkable women in show business - or anything else, for that matter. And in that respect, there is no other way to categorize this book except as a biography.In addition to his relationship with the lady, Berg does give a brief background of her life story, but that's really incidental when you read the whole book and realize that unlike ""Lindbergh"", he does not stand apart from his subject - indeed, he celebrates his relationship with Hepburn.I don't think I've ever read a book that worships its subject more - but considering who the book is about I don't mind at all."
1,A. Scott Berg Remembered,"I purchased this book in the hope of getting some insight into Katharine Hepburn. What I received instead was a self-aggrandizing book that was more about the author than his subject. This book spends much too much time talking about A. Scott Berg, his background, his acquaintances among the monied classes, his life partners, and his previous works.A very disappointing work."
4,A great read,"I enjoyed this warm and respectful book detailing the author's friendship with Katharine Hepburn. It's the only book I've read about her so far, and I felt I received not only a satisfying glimpse of her personality but enough background to get a handle on the important moments of her career and private life (such as her relationships with Howard Hughes and Spencer Tracy). There were also fascinating glimpses of Michael Jackson (who has dinner with her, in one anecdote) and the monumentally egotistical Warren Beatty (who has the author convince her to appear in ""Love Affair""). The only thing I found a bit strange about this book is that the author wrote a biography of an editor and mentions publishing and editing quite a bit - and this book has more than a few spelling and punctuation errors. I don't think it was a good idea to rush it to market. Otherwise, it's great. It was a refreshing and pleasant read."
2,Title should be- ME; OTHERS TRASHED; KATE REMEMBERED,"If I edited the book down to the parts about Katharine Hepburn that I bought the book for, at least a third would have ended up on the cutting room floor.An alternate title might be: ""I'm tired of writing about me, here's what Hepburn had to say.""A. Scott Berg has used Katharine Hepburn's unique life to relaunch himself and spread dirt using Miss Hepburn as his foil . I find Berg a gossip of the worst kind seeking the largest audience he can find. Most of the people trashed are dead and can't tell their side of the story. The others know that responding will only bring more attention to matters best left between the parties themselves.And all of it written in sheeps clothing as a ""dear friend."" Save us all from friends like that. Shame on you, Mr. Berg."
2,If you want a book about Kate-this Ain't It,"I found this book a self-aggrandizement of Mr. Berg rather than a revealing memoir about the Great Kate Hepburn. He does talk on and on about others he's known and speculates on why Spencer Tracy drank. Hepburn theoretically told him to write his spectulation down, hence it appears in this book. All in all, the Barbara Leaming book is 100x better and more interesting. Or for gossip about Kate as a friend, read Garson Kanin's Tracey and Hepburn. I really didn't need (nor do I think Hepburn really would've wanted us) to know how feeble she was in the last 10 years, with her memory gone, being depressed and lonely, etc.Mr. Berg should've taken a year or so to think it over and reread this which he supposedly really wrote in 1999 just waiting for 'the end'. She comes off well but he doesn't."
2,Where are the photos?,"I've just leafed through ""Kate Remembered"" and I must admit that for a biography that was drawn from a 20 year friendship there are amazingly few photos that provide evidence for such a relationship, or indeed evidence of Kate's interactions with the world she lived in.Hopefully once I've read the text I'll be more impressed with what I was hoping would be a ground breaking biography."
4,If Eric Holk understood the English language as he thinks he,"does, he would know that the word 'anxiously' is not the same as 'eagerly'. 'Anxious' indicates 'anxiety filled anticipation'. Perhaps he would not have been so ready to defame Scott Berg's words regarding the publication of this book."
4,great biography,"If you want to know about Kate & her work, beginning to end, this will give you the facts. A compelling read. Not really a story, but rather, a running diary of Kate and Scott's relationship as friends, as well as alot of Kate's secrets that she entrusts to the author. Made me feel as if I was sitting there in the room, listenning to her speak and reminisce. I learned alot about Katherine Hepburn in this book, which made me want to go back and review all her old movies again, to see all the things she refers to.....Addicting & a great book!!"
1,This...is Katharine Hepburn? Not according to her Auto-bio,"Berg's book was well written, but wasn't a REAL biography-just an idiot wanting to brag of his ""friendship"" with such an amazing star. I feel that Berg knows next to nothing about Kate because he took all false facts from Leaming and Edwards-both authors THINK they are talking about the actress Katharine Hepburn, but really they aren't."
2,Self Serving,"I give this book two stars because I am a fan of Katharine Hepburn. The only thing I learned in this book is that the author wanted to make sure everyone knew how much Ms. Hepburn adored him and how witty he was with her, and how much influence he had on her later on in life; and I found that kind of creepy. If you want to hear her voice without Berg's slant, just read ""Me""."
4,A quick and interesting read,"I read this book in two nights and enjoyed every minute of it, especially since it gives a lot of personal insight into Miss Hepburn's life. It tends to jump around a bit, but that is understandable given that it is based on the author's many visits with Miss Hepburn. My only complaint is that it needs better editing -- there were several grammar and spelling errors."
3,Kate Remembered,"I have just finished ""Kate Remembered"" and I really believe the author was writing about HIM. It had nothing new about the lady herself. I did take a trip several months ago to Old Saybrook and so reading about driving around Fenwich and Old Saybrook was something I did enjoy in the book. I was disappointed that he mentioned over and over about her drinking, his drinking, their drinking....it wasn't necessary. We will all miss Miss Hepburn, but I won't be reading anymore of this authors work. thank you"
2,disappointed,"As a previous reviewer posted: ""He comes across as self-centered and self-serving."" This was my view as well. Although there were some interesting excerpts from actual conversations and the stories about M. Jackson and W. Beatty were hilarious, there were some passages that caused eyes to roll. For example, Berg's mention of Kevin McCormick (and his recently becoming an executive at Twentieth Century Fox) did not add any substance to the text but was included only to stroke the ego of his partner. This was really in bad taste considering the classy subject of the book. I found her 1991 autobiography *much* more satisfying."
2,Only random bits of Hepburn's life,"Save your money and buy a more complete biography of Katherin Hepburn. The Berg book only gives you very brief and very random bits of her life story, with most of it centered around her later, rather mundane, years when Berg met her. You will not come away from the book with any added understanding of Hepburn the person or the actress. It was a very disappointing book. It's hard to understand how someone like Berg who knew Hepburn so long could have come away with so little insight about her. Also, much of the book is about Berg's life--not Hepburn's--so take what Berg says himself to heart--it's not a full biography of Hepburn."
3,"Of interest, but....","This book answers a number of questions I had about Hepburn's final years, and I'm glad for that, but I come away from the reading experience feeling that the book's publication within days of Hepburn's death borders on exploitation. And, I've seen Berg interviewed on TV (as well as heard him interviewed on NPR). He comes across as really cheerful and chatty, like he's having the time of his life. I certainly wouldn't feel that way if MY great friend of twenty years had just passed away. Throughout the book, the reader gets the impression that Berg feels he is oh-so-special because of his access to Hepburn for all those years. So, in the end, Berg presents himself in a none-too-flattering light, but Hepburn comes off well, and I admire her as much as I ever did."
4,Enjoyable,"In many ways, the tale of a young Scott Berg's friendship with Katharine Hepburn is similar to many May-December friendships. She was remarkable and fascinating on the subject of Hollywood and movies. But for me the best bit in this book is Berg's encounter with Warren Beatty ""the movie star""--hilarious story and alone worth the price of admission."
3,A Good Book that Needs an Index,"I picked up the book one afternoon and started reading; I read until the wee hours of the morning. The book is that captivating. The book reveals that Katharine Hepburn lives up to her image as a strong individual.My one major criticism of the book is that it lacks an index. When I wanted to read a paragraph to a friend, I flipped to the back of the book for the index. There wasn't one. I had to search and search to find the incident in Ms. Hepburn's life. The lack of an index so hurts this book that I would have rated it one star lower than I would have if it had included a good index."
5,A great book,"I knew very little about Katharine Hepburn before reading this book. Only movie I remember her being in is ""On Golden Pond"". I had seen her on TV a few times and heard a bit about her.Mr. Berg does a good job of giving us an overview of Hepburn's life. This is not a gossipy type biography nor one just full of dates and facts. Knowing some of the incidents that happened between Berg and Hepburn help in understanding Berg's view while writing this book. I felt the stories about Irene S. did not add much to the book. Even though we get to know some about Hepburn's personal life, I feel that we are still being kept at arm's length from really knowing who Katharine Hepburn was inside. Mr. Berg does a great job of writing a captivating story about a unique woman."
1,Very Disappointing,"Hepburn fans (like me) won't be able to resist reading this book, but it is truly disappointing. It's as much about Berg as Hepburn. Biographers should not inject themselves into the stories of those that they're writing about. I found the fact that Berg himself was a big part of the book extremely distracting and downright annoying. He comes across as self-centered and self-serving."
1,A. Scott Berg Remembered,"I purchased this book in the hope of getting some insight into Katharine Hepburn. What I received instead was a self-aggrandizing book that was more about the author than his subject. This book spends much too much time talking about A. Scott Berg, his education, his acquaintances among the monied classes, his life partners, and his previous works.A very disappointing work."
1,Huge disappointment,"I rarely buy a newly published book, but I've admired Katharine Hepburn for so long and the hype for this book was so strong that I got it. I wish I hadn't. It seemed like a perfect mating of author, subject, and timing, but something went wrong. The writing is amateurish and tedious, and Hepburn comes across as self-absorbed and shallow. I never would have imagined this book would be so boring."
1,Just an idiot bragging about his relationsip with a star,"A. Scott Berg's book KATE REMEMBERED, is well-written, but shows false facts used by other authors (such as Anne Edwards, who THINKS she knows how to write a Hepburn Biography, but can't seem to get her facts straight), and jsut tells what his experience was with Kate. If he were going to write a book on Kate, and keep it a huge secret (it's been said that even Heburn's survivors were surprised, and appalled by this novel), thne relase it that they should at least give fans what they expect of a novel like that- a tell all book. Like KH had some huge secret she NEEDED to share with fans after her death."
3,katharine with an a!,"when i got this book i thought that it was going to be a charming read about a man sharing his memories of his friend, it's not quite like that, although that was the writers intention, there is something about reading this book that makes the reader feel ucomfortable, almost like listening in on a phone call without the other person knowing, the book is rather bland and only livens when irene selznick enters she was clearly a riot!if you get this book just be prepared to feel as though your envading an old womans privacy!"
2,"just an opportunist selling his supposedly best ""friend"".","As a KH fan I couldn't be more disappointed.This book is just another way to serve Mr. Berg's career. He talks more about himself than KH. He uses weird excuses to end up talking about his Pulitzer price and his dull career (who cares about Mr.Berg???).The book won't give you any new information about KH!!! I don't need to know about dull intimacies that have no interest whatsoever for any true KH fan. It is just pure bragging of Mr.Berg.After reading this book I don't know KH any better (all info is already known by real fans) but instead I definitively know that Mr.Berg is not the kind of person I would invite for tea time.Had Mr. Berg wanted to pay a homage to KH, he could have done it writing other things about her that might have been more interesting.I suggest not to waste your money."
3,A half/half affair **1/2.,"(1991) ""Strange Affair"", the 16th studio album by Wishbone Ash. The title track is amazing, as is ""Renegade"" and ""Standing In The Rain"". Not the most memorable Ash album, but it had some good moments. Last album with Martin Turner and Ted Turner, first album with drummer Ray Weston. 5 years would pass before their next studio release ""Illuminations""."
4,"A ""Must Read"" for Buckeye Fans!","This is a great read, filled with interesting stories and insights. I especially liked the recollections of the players and coaches, and the author's personal accounts. It took me deep inside the program, with the perfect blend of history, reporting on the big games and events of the last few years.A ""must read"" for Buckeye fans of all generations."
5,Does it get any better than this?,"Great to get this in CD, since my orginal Vinyl of this seems to have disappeared. Great music, great musicians."
2,Mediocre Battle-of-the-Horns,"Although a few of the tracks seem inspired, it's mainly Mulligan going through the motions with Getz, with very little chemistry between them. ""Anything Goes"" and ""Scrapple From the Apple"" are nice enough but beyond that it's weak. Mulligan himself didn't speak very highly of the recording session, saying that he enjoyed his other dates with Desmond, Webster, and Hodges, but mentioning that ""Granz wanted that session a lot more than I did."" Of course, it would be quite out of the ordinary to hear anything but negative remarks about Stan Getz and his sparkling personality. Save your money and go buy the 2-disk reissue of ""Meets Ben Webster"". Or, if you don't have it already, the seminal Pacific recordings with Chet Baker."
4,Stegner at His Best,"Superb. So well written. Needless to say, Stegner writes of areas he has known first hand, rivers he has navigated and the depth of times and places only he seems capable of knitting together. A must-read for Western American historians and those having just general interest. Reminds one of Bechloss' Undaunted Courage, although slightly different considering the time written and the base purposes of the journeys.Sandy Greenblat"
4,The Last Explorer,"If you are interesting in the history of the American west, this is required reading. John Wesley Powell was one of the last explorers of the American west and one of the first American scientific bureaucrats. He failed to correct the federal government policy in the West during the period of rapid settlement at the end of the 19th century, but he did succeed at establishing a tradition of federal support for science that has has a profound influence over the course of U.S. history."
4,Absorbing History,Wallace Stegner writes wonderful descriptions. I think the description of the first Colorado trip is much better than Powell's. I felt right there. I have been down most of the Colorado In fact was on a reenactment of Powell's trip with dories built like his several years ago with Holiday Expeditions and Oars.The old dories spilled in most of the rapids and were not at all like our present day dories. Those men were a breed apart. We do this for fun with good food and equipment. They did it with inadequate everything. They were amazing adventurers. The rest of the book about the development of the west was llso interesting and absorbing
4,God Is Good!,This was just a wonderful cd this cd helped me when I was going through a rough time in my life. It is full of glory.
2,Warning! All parts may not be available,Frustrating to say the least. We needed half-inch cross or X fittings for the copper arbors. Sounds easy. I have even called long distance to a hardware that says they sell millions of products. They can't get the part. We are going to have to retrofit with PVC plastic fittings or perhaps brass. I wish this lack of needed parts had been checked out before the authors had written the book. I had no idea we would have this problem so we have 6 copper pipes sitting waiting to be used.
3,This CD is 36 and 1/2 minutes long.,"I assume if you are reading this page you are either about to review The Shining or are considering purchasing it. I will tell you what I wish someone had told me: this cd is extremely short. If you think Jay Dee was an incredible producer (which I do) and enjoy the artists that appear on here (another affirmative), then this CD is worth getting. However $13 for 36 minutes seems fairly steep, and a lot of the material seems thrown together. I realize that the majority of this project was completed after his death, but a man with a huge library of unreleased work should have had more to offer here (no random SV cuts?). If you are looking for an introduction to Dilla I would recommend Jaylib, if you are looking to hear his better work I would say Donuts (or even Fantastic Vol. 2 or Like Water For Chocolate). If you are looking to round out your collection, then this is a CD for you."
2,Pretty lame,I was hoping this would be based on the classic micronauts comic from the 80's however it was based on some lame reworking of the story. So bad I couldn't even finish it.
3,"ok, but not for young children","I enjoyed micronauts in the 70s and saw this as a potential way to introduce the kids. However, this has a few curse words in it, ones that I'd rather not have kids the age to play with the toys learn. The images at times are a bit too graphic for kids too. For those who enjoyed the toys as a child or are old enough for a little language and images then this DVD will be fine, though it is a bit shorter than I'd like."
3,I will finish it,"I'm on chapter 3 as of now. I must say, this is not for the lay person! I'm kind of frustrated because I don't really understand a lot of what I'm reading. It's not the author's fault, however. I am very new to virology and want to educate myself on the subject. I was going to throw the book away, but I decided that I am going to finish it (and just because it's difficult, doesn't mean I should give up, right?) Unfortunately, since I am new, I can't recommend any other virus books. What I can recommend is to finish something you start, even if it is difficult."
4,Fabulous stocking stuffer,Bought this as a joke for a friend -- and then she said she really liked it! I read a few of the stories myself and was actually surprised that they were well written and even delightful. Sexy and smart.
2,Very disappointing,"Laugh out loud funny, yes, erotic, no. The writing is awful, especially the ""erotic"" scenes, which are hysterically funny because they are so poorly written. This isn't so bad it's good, it's just plain bad. The only reasons I gave this 2 stars is for Karin Kallmaker's and Andrea Dale's stories. Buy it used, if you must. Judging how many are for sale right now, that shouldn't be difficult."
1,Save your money!,"The eye-catching ""Official Strategy Guide"" and Maxis-style front cover promise much, but this book is a grave disappointment. While it may be of use to those who have never used SimCity before, anyone looking for the in-depth information which is alluded to will be left wanting.The few titbits of useful information which are provided, such as the land value calculation on p68, are poorly explained and make one wonder how much the author actually understands his subject.Chapter 3 is pure padding - it just lists Maxis' own table of differences between SC2000 and SC3000. A useful-sounding appendix giving a list of power consumption values (p94) and ""specific consumption figures"" (p132) is alas missing from the book entirely. The number of fundamental errors which should have been caught by even trivial proofreading is _awful_: 3x3=16 (p57); 5x4500=4500 (p58).Put these things together and you have a complete waste of money..."
3,"Good info, but errors make it confusing","This is better than the other SC3k guides out there, but it's hardly great. Some of the charts such as NIMBY and land value effects are great, but they can also be contradictory, probably due to stupid mistakes that should've been caught in editing. They really should fix all the problems with this guide and re-release it. A game this good deserves a better guide and a game this difficult warrants one."
2,Prima Scores a Failing Grade!,"Okay, Prima is one of the a respectable company that produces great game guides. While reading this guide I discovered that Prima is perfect either. This book was lacking in the accuracy department and should be improved, though we all know that will never happen, D---!"
1,Without worth,"Like many Prima strategy guides, this one was released not because the writer has any great insight into SimCity, but because they want your money. It's full of typos, the charts contain totally inaccurate information, and half of the things promised on the back of the book (""suggestions for exciting landscapes!"") aren't actually covered. The actual advice in the book is awful hack-work -- though if you search carefully through the $19.95 book you ought to be able to find about one or two hints."
2,All it really does is repeat what was in the manual!,"This help guide states it the begining that it will not repeat many of the objectives that the manual has gone over, however with the exception of a few helpful charts this book really isn't worth the money, because it does repeat a lot of things, there are not any cheat codes either."
3,It is pretty good!,even though the game didn't live up to what the company said it is still a good guide.
5,First Rate Action from the Master Storyteller!,"I would just like to say that for my money, the Shane Skully series by master storyteller Stephen Cannell shows us once more that this author is truly a genius. Nothing he produces is less than exciting, gripping, intelligent and highly entertaining. The Skully tales would rival James Bond for sheer excitement and drama if made into a motion picture series. In the ""Vertical Coffin"", I particularly enjoyed the passages which take place in the ""Chocolate Mountains"", since I live only minutes away in Palm Springs.Bravo Mr. Cannell....another winner here!"
4,4 1/2 stars,"With his crisp dialogue and his 'pull you in' writing style, Cannell, once again, provides a suspenseful reading experience while keeping the pace brisk. Cannell's experience as a writer definitely shows, for each new novel seems better than the last.Highly recommended."
1,Not As Advertised,"I read the book several years ago and was intrigued by the writing. The author conveyed the emotional journey of her protagonist very skillfully and with much more depth than one expects in books of this genre. Frankly I couldn't believe it would be possible to turn the book into a watchable movie so I gambled a few dollars just to see.I was expecting poor film making, but I wasn't expecting the atrocious bootleg quality DVD that arrived. The aspect ratio is 3:4 (old fashioned TV screen stuff) and there are no subtitles. The film quality is grainy and looks as if it was ripped off a very old VHS tape. In short, I've seen Russian bootleg DVDs whose quality was infinitely superior to this product. It's worth perhaps $1.50 at the very most, so long as you don't mind the migrane you'd get if you actually tried to watch it for more than three or four minutes before ejecting it from your system and throwing it into the trash."
5,Uniden Cordless Phone,"The Uniden phone that I actually received was a Uniden DCT 746 - an upgrade from what I ordered. It was compatible with the Uniden DCT 646 phones that I already were using in my home, a good thing. I don't think the 646 is being made any more, but at least I was able to add another line because of the upgrade compatibility. It is easy to use, easy to add to our existing system. The Uniden DCT phones seem to be durable, long battery life, good all-around equipment."
1,I thought Uniden was a good name for phones...my mistake,"This phone is awful! I had been previously using a Siemens cordless, which was exceptionally good for 4 years until my wife dropped it in the toilet one last time (it survived other such incedents). I was looking for a phone with speaker on the handset and found this one. I don't know much about the power of the phone, but I do know that this phone produces a terrible signal most of the time. Our relatives are always complaining that the signal is broken and choppy. When I call to speak to my wife I can barely make out what she's saying. It isn't like that all the time, but probably 80% of the time. I do run wireless internet from a router and don't know if that has anything to do with it. The phone is small and light, which is good. I need this phone for basic needs and it doesn't fulfill me what-so-ever. I will not buy a Uniden again."
4,For the price...,"Nothing bad to say. It's inexpensive, and it works well. The personal ring tones are a nice feature. The flashing red status light can be a dagger if used in an entertainment room. Compared to other low cost wireless, it's a good deal."
5,Review of Uniden DCT 646 2.4 Cordless Phone,"I have used Uniden products for many years and have always been pleased. This product is no different, the quality and ease of use is wonderful. I would recommend anyone to purchase this product."
1,"Good Bye 6400, Hello HP","After reading the reviews here I realize that Epson appears to have a problem with these same clogged heads. My black ink was printing sparadically so I decided to replace the cartdridge with a new one, but not before running the clean heads feature 10 plus times. (more ink cartridge money wasted $$$) I loaded the new cartridge and to my surprise, nothing. I removed it, there was ink there but it would not print. Finally, I removed the cartidge and tried to manually clean the head. Nothing. The slightly over one year old printer now sits next to my garbage ready for a trip to the dump and I have a new HP that runs like a champ. I will never own another Epson product, very disappointing and expensive lesson."
1,worst printer,This is the worst printer ever! The ease of use is zero. I used to have a HP that would print at the touch of a button. This Epson simply doesn't print at one touch. I'm going back to HP.
3,Not for online auctioners,"I purchased this unit to open up space. I use Epson at work so I had some knowledge of the brand. If you are looking for a copier and printer, this is a good unit. But if you are looking for something to scan ""not perfectly flat objects"" this isn't the one. I tried to scan something that had a slight raise in the middle and could not get a clear image. I contacted Epson and was told that the scanners on these units were not designed for anything except flat paper, etc..., in fact they were just a extra bonus,(add on)for the printer/copier. Also be prepared for the ink usage, it uses a lot of ink for photos, compared to other printers. So I'm going back to my Canon D660U scanner and HP printer and sending this back until I can find something else with the quality as my current scanner."
1,Another dead CX6400,"As stated by many many people who bought this printer. The print head is rubbish. I've owned this printer for a little less than 2yrs now. And, while it printed fantastically when new, it has now fallen victim to the clogged print head problem that is well documented on the internet. I recently changed ink cartridges and performed the head cleaning multiple times, but the printer will not longer print black at all, and yellow and cyan are spotty at best.Do not buy this printer, find something better. I don't think this is necessarily inherent of all Epson printers, but I would definitely not buy this one again."
1,Don't buy unless you want problems,"I was very satisfied with my CX6400 when I first bought it. After having to constantly buy ink, and get these continuous pop up messages reminding me to buy more ink, and then finally buy more ink just to have the printer quit printing !!! I am fed up with Epson. There was a class action lawsuit about Epson's not printing and forcing you to buy more ink when the ink tanks were low (not even out of ink). The resolution? They would give you $20 worth of ink. I'm done with Epson. Just bought a HP laserjet printer because of all the good reviews."
1,Good until warrantee period ends!,"Same as the others! Mine died at just past the end of the warrantee period, too! I can't say I'll ever buy another Epson.........."
2,Great for a little while and then nothing,This product starts out great and then quickly does nothing. Without any warning our product stopped working at 13 months. This is just one month after the warranty is up. We had just purchased new ink cartridges and now that is more money that can't be replaced. Nothing will work on this printer except the on and off button. Buy something else.
3,Dead after first birthday,"I had purchased this all-in-one back in December of 2003. During the past year I mainly used it for general use. Setup was easy enough, and the quality was adequate for what I needed.At the beginning of this month, the printer started printing in lines and was not legible. I had purchased all new color and black cartridges, thinking that perhaps on of them had clogged up. After installing the new cartridges, I had the same problem. So, I would run the head cleaning utility, print a test page, run the utility again, print a test page again...you get the picture. The ink levels are now down to 30% and the printer is still not working correctly. I tried to clean out any clogged ink within the printer with no luck.The printer was good for the time it lasted, but I will not be purchasing an Epson again."
3,"Nice printer, but some drawbacks","Ok, I got this printer after much pressure for printing photos. Got a little patience? Good...because this will push your buttons to oblivion. Im not saying this multifunction is bad, it just has a little kinks to be worked out. (Ok Epson?)Printing: nice and quiet, and fast. Nothing wrong there.Scanner: ok too, but it takes a while to get the commands to the scanner. (Or maybe that was my computer, who knows?) The first time I used it, I scanned the same photo twice, because I didnt think it was already scanned. However, I think their software should have a little more umph to it, Im not thinking Adobe Photoshop, but close.Copy: well, its ok, if you are only copying paper to paper, but if magazine to paper, this is where they get you. I copied an article but the print came out so small, I was very unhappy. So I scanned, zoomed, cropped and printed. Then I felt satisfied.Card Print: Havent used it yet, waiting for a digital camera...hint hint."
1,BUY AT OWN RISK!!!!,"I bought this printer because of the good reviews BUT the paper feeder has the WORST quality. After using it for a few weeks, it broke down, printing/ scanning pictures or text with no top margins and very wide bottom margins. I called up EPSON and they exchanged my NEW printer with a REFURBISHED one AND as soon as I got it, there's soemthing wrong again with the feeder. It could not ""sense"" the papers. So I called them up again & they again sent me a REFURBISHED unit AND THERE'S SOEMTHING WRONG STILL WITH THE FEEDER. This, by far is the worst printer and WORST warranty coverage EVER!!!! I emailed their customer service to file a complaint and they did not even respond!"
2,3 out of 5 bad in 20 months,"I purchased 5 of these printers about 20 months ago. 3 of these printers had issue with the nozzle heads drying up. The first one that went bad, Epson advised that you need to keep the equipment off when you are not using. So I did that for the others, but to no avail. The printer heads still dried up.My recommendation, we replaced these models with the Canon Pixma MP 780. These are great printers! The scanning feature is lightning FAST compared to this EPSON and the print speed and quality is definitely way better HANDS DOWN. For the money, you may as well get a good product."
2,programmed for you to buy ink,"This is an annoying piece of equipment designed solely to force you to buy more ink catridges. Point being, even though you want to just make a black and white copy, or print black and white, if one of the color cartridges is empty the whole machine shuts down until you get the new color cartridge you really don't need. Ha ha! I'm sure some VP of marketing got a bonus for this idea."
3,"worked great for a few months, now its dead","Same experience expressed elsewhere - it works great out of the box, until the print head dries up and now it's useless. Don't buy this."
3,Similar experience to others here...,"I bought this printer 5/23/2004. It worked flawlessly until this week. The problem? Clogged printhead. I am actually going to go ahead and repair the printer. The scanner portion still works perfectly, as does the rest of the printer. I'm not so sure I didn't cause the problem myself... I have always used Epson ink, until this last time.For me, the printer hasn't been near as bad as everyone elses experiences."
1,Piece of crap.....run away from Epson printers,"You go to an electronics to store to buy a printer.. instead you find a multifunction printer that can scan and copy too at around the same price! Viola .. it should be EPSON peice of crap!! You buy the crap thinking you got a great deal.The crap will shows its ugly head within couple of months with misaligned prints and there its starts the story of repeated head cleaning and nozzle checks.Withing few months you pay another $60 bucks to buy ink and it still continues to drain with wasted ink due to misaligned prints and nozzle checks/alignment checks.Epson customer service first sucks the remaining ink tring to run nozle checks and head cleaning. Then dodges any request to replace the product(well...the crap conveniently stopped working completely on 12th month, just past the warranty time).I'll never buy an Epson product again. However great it was w.r.t features and price. Run away from Epson printers!!"
1,don't buy it,"I owned this printer for only 5 months before it stopped printing clearly. Now I have to clean the printer heads several times before even printing one page or it is smudged or too faint to read. Cleaning the heads sucks the printer cartridges dry, so I have to buy a new one every week almost. I will give up on this printer and buy a laser printer. It is such a piece of junk that I wanted to write this review to warn others. I've never written a review of any product before this. I would give it no stars if they offered that option."
2,"Nice Hardware, Poor software (on MacOSX)","I am very satisfied with the print quality, borderless on photo paper is just stunning.As a scanner the printer is really hampered, on Mac OSX, by the supplied drivers: The installer crashed a number of times, the ""Smart controller"" often unexpectedly quits.Also, the screens in the ""scan and save"" function have many field that I just can't edit, for example the Format where you could choose between PDF, JPEG is stuck at JPEG, a real bummer. The resolution field is also unmodifiable.The software is obviously a bad port from windows, as it does not obey the most basic keyboard shortcuts (cmd-W to close a window does not work, cannot tab between fields etc). The ""Smart panel"" is laughable, especialy its ""advanced settings"" that's totally useless.If I had known this I would not have bought the printer.And yes, I went to Epson site to get the latest drivers&software."
4,Great Value,"I bought this printer a little over a month ago, and I am completely satisfied. I used the card reader for photo prints for the first time last week and I really liked the process. Prints came out very nice. Comparable to an HP photosmart printer, but I feel like the epson prints were much nicer because you don't have to wait for ink to dry. Colors are just as vivid as an HP photo printer. But I do suggest that you buy DuraBrite Photo paper. This optimizes the photos appearance.The printer is very easy to set up, Nice speed and very quiet. This is a great value for anyone looking for a quality multi-function printer. Especially with the great rebate Amazon is offering at the moment. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is a little bulky. But that is expected from a multi-function printer. I would LOVE for these to shrink a tad bit!"
1,Won't print without 4 full cartrisges,"DON'T BUY IT! It won't print, including in black and white, without four full cartidges. What moron thought of that?!"
4,The Right Word,We need more brain stimulators like this book. I understand they rarely make the bestseller lists.
5,Buckley's Glorious Narcissism On Display,"Buckley once again demonstrates his mastery of the art of pseudo-intellectual gibberish in his narcissistic essay ""the right word."" Buckley begins with the premise that he is the world's greatest living writer, then proceeds to spew his awkward, mutilated ""english"" in a masturbatory frenzy of classic Buckley bibble-di-babble.The book loses something without the constant stammering and ""...ah, ah, ah, ah..""s that Buckley enhances his oral presentations with. The book is nonetheless a must-read for delusionary individuals who consider themselves to be intellectuals or scholars of the english language."
5,"Bravo Bill, and to your editor too.","No politics (? ) and great penmanship. Even a few tips on wordprocessing, writing fast, foreign words, reading Fowler, and on how to remain civil when virulent letters are in hand. Email hacks: see what a real correspondence can be <grin>; the generous excerpts are funny, enlightening, polite beyond words. Right again, Bill."
5,"As well, eye-catching title, beautiful content...","As was the case for another of your reviewers, this book caught my eye because of its title. However, glancing through it, I got an inkling that there was something special about it, so I bought it. Well, it's a BEAUTIFUL book. If your tastes don't include books that require a measure of intellect, perhaps you should stay away, as it is a book geared towards the intelligent reader...but otherwise get it if you possibly can. The prose is lovely, imaginative, rich and heartbreaking. Raymo writes with admirable understatement and pathos. It's not absolutely perfect, but there's an ineffable magic about the book that supersedes slight and transient rough spots. Anyone of a romantic or idealistic bent ought to read this one if their wellsprings of hope for beauty need renewing. It's gentle, vivid, and wonderful."
4,"imaginative story, great read","i enjoyed this novel alot, but did not find the dork to be particularly sympathetic. there was too much emphasis on his need and desire for beauty in life and no real empathy for those who are less fortunate as was he."
5,The Dork of Cork,"I just keep buying more copies and giving them to friends... EVERYONE loves this book. It is written so exquisitely beautiful, and alarmingly funny.. Hysterical characters, so human .... Chet Raymo-- What a man, what a writer...... buy it, you will be happy you did."
5,Vonnegutesque,"Raymo continues the Kurt Vonnegut/Tom Robins traditions of a little science, a little philosophy, a little absurdity and a fair helping of sex."
1,Not a animated movie,"This is not an animated movie, it's just picture after picture take out of a comic book with a guy reading, that's it! Huge disappointment!"
1,"Got ""in exile"" ordered ""cookin in old grease"". Disappointing.",Ordered this cd from Hastings entertainment and received in exile. Bummed. Supposed to be an Xmas present... Too late to do anything about it now.
1,"Too much opinion, and too little fact.","I am dropping my Intercultural Communications class based on the poor design of this book. It was too much like reading a philosophical essay, rather than a college textbook. Within the first 2 chapters, they introduced no less than five definitions of culture, none of them matching what sociology defines it as. The entire textbook is largely based on writing and theory works, and ignores many of the basic principles that have been well defined and accepted as valid through sociology."
2,Intercultural communication,"This is a really boring book, it is hard to read. The first couple of chapters are over 50 pages long. Hardly any illustrations. The only thing I did like about it was all of the examples. Hopefully your instructor picks a more interesting book than this one."

Then JBL is hitting Booker T with the belt. Then Undertaker is chokeslamming JBL to win. Smackdown after AGD The Undertaker is defeating JBL in a Hardcore match.

3,Pretty good,"ok, before i start i want to no why every1 is talking about armagedden? who fricken cares right now anyway. Anyway survivor series was great i got it on PPV. the best match was either the crusierweight match or the raw elimination match. i missed the womens match though, i went to get some chips and the next thing i no its over. i would recomend this PPV to undertaker fans because he killed hedienriech( or how ever u spell it) dishing out the last ride, a chokeslam, and the tombstone. anyway it was pretty good i rate it 7/10"

I mean, watching it on tv is cool, but when you are there live, there is just something different about things. Butt anyway i dont remember everything blow for blow, so just let me say this was a good ppv i like the classic elmination matches, but i coulda picked a better opponent for jbl other than booker, (he did put up a good show though) final rating 7.5/10"

4,very good ppv,"really good ppv the raw 8 man elimination match was the best... not much blood in the whole ppv but aslong as the is two or mor people that bleed its a good ppv and two people did maven and , gene snitzky. well thats what i thought of the ppv:-)"
2,"Still ""trying"" to like this...not a good sign","I think it's his voice--whiney and nasaly and, well, not sure what he's singing about. Sounds like he's straining for every note.Musically, the band plays well -- especially the bass. But I think the lead vocalist is the problem, for me.I've listened to it four times but the only song I can listen through all the way (and enjoy, a bit) is THE PRETENDER. The rest I find I skip about half way through them."
4,Keep in mind you need to lose the cat,great...worked well but you have to have a rich mix in your motor and no cat on your ex.
5,music,"This is a good cd has the good songs by the Intrudrs. I reccomend buy it becauseit is good music, real music."
1,NO GOOD,TOOK A CHANCE ON THIS ONE. NO DIAMETER OR LENGTH LISTED SO IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW IF IT WILL FIT.....IT DIDN'T.
3,Lacks detail but is up-to-date,"I purchased this book after being extremely happy with ""Time Out Amsterdam"" but was disappointed. The Milan version lacks detail and has limited restaraunt and hotel listings. It is the most recent Milan book available (at least when I bought it) but I thought Time Out could have done better."
3,"Best available, but out of date.","Of the three books I have on newspaper syndication this is the most useful. However much content is dated.John CulletonColumnist, Carroll County Times & Eldersburg Eagle."
2,Pale Writer,I write a column for a newspaper; so this book's to help you syndicate things was welcome. But the author mentions nothing about the legal side of this adventure. Who owns what? What protections does each side want/need?
2,cool hook but that's it,It looks neat and makes a beeping noise near metal objects but only if you hold it at the right angle and distance from the metal. It's very fancy for a hook and my son likes to play with it. It is a cool hook for dress up and priced right.
2,not a lot of beep for your buck,"I got this for my 5 yr pirate lover for his birtday. It has this awful noise that comes out of it almost all of the time you turn it on. You have to adjust the the dial until it stops that noise then go ""treasure hunting"". Everything seems to set it off except the things he's hunting for. stupid toy. lol. Well, in the end, it's just a cool hook he uses when he's dressing up as a pirate. Kinda expensive hook. Oh... and the little ""treasures"" that came with it... lasted about 3 days until they were lost. They were about the size of nickles."
4,"doesn't ""fit all models""... but still works great","My BK3 Triple Blower Fan is installed now and working great but not without a few challenges.The main gripe I have is that the listing says something like ""fits all FMI models"". Unfortunately this is not true. I have a 36"" FMI fireplace from the early 90's. In the end I got it to ""fit"" but none of the mounts, screw holes, or anything else was as described in the diagrams. I had to come up with a completely custom rig to install the blower fan.Other details you may want to know... (1) It's a little noisier than I had hoped for but we got used to it. On the other hand we are very happy with the amount of heat our fireplace now kicks off. (2) When I purchased this unit the image on amazon showed the wrong model. The image that is there as I write this review is corrected (a metal frame with 3 separate black plastic propellers). (3) I found it interesting to know that the fan unit draws about 70-90 watts."
2,Should last longer,"I purchased the AT&T 2320 phone system with three expansion phones (AT&T 2300 2.4 GHz DSS) approximately two years ago. The system worked great for the first year with good sound quality and easy conferencing. However, over the last several months we have noticed that several of the number pads on the phones are difficult to press or simply don't work at all. As an adult-only home we expected the phones to last longer since we weren't using them excessively or treating them roughly. We are down to only one workable handset in which the numbers do not stick. I would not purchase this product again."
5,the MOST underated band ever,"a strange hybrid of bluesy barroom rock and roll ala the stones and glam rock savvy, comparable to hanoi rocks, early guns and roses, and even the great and lovely new york dolls. lead singer tyla is a sad poet that begs to be heard. jason from rollins band loves this band, and so do i..."
5,Festive & Stylish Girly Shoes!,"My daughter loves these shoes - she's 10 and a blossoming fashionista. Problem is - finding age-appropriate fashion items. These are little girl enough for me (no heels, please) while having the sparkly bling all girls her age love! She wore these through the holiday season and the pretty bronze color were different from the usual black holiday shoes. A great buy - we highly recommend!"
2,"Dr, Sears comes off as a quack doctor with ulterior motives to buy his products","These books are vague, they don't go into a good plan that can easily and healithy be useful. Want more help? buy more of his products. Buy his supplements. Join his group (which i didn't do because i heard so many problems with it). Is it any wonder he doesn't sell many of these books and goes instead to direct marketing with booklets of misleading information to get to you purchase this and more. I'm very suspicious of him and this book. I don't know about his other books right now but am not going to try them.I would not waste any money on anything from this man again."
2,excellent book for total novices,"if you have never even heard of interval training, then this is a good book for you.But if you even know the definition of interval training you will probably learn nothing new here"
5,Great chair,"Definitely the best so far I've owned & primarily used on beach trips. Mesh is the way to go. Have to disagree with a couple reviews in that it's too ""low"" or ""heavy"" - unless you're over 6 ft and under 80lbs, neither stand true. Cupholder is just that...a CUP HOLDER. On one trip I had a problem with a friend forcing the footrest to close & broke it so contacted the vendor who sent a replacement out immediately which was easily put on. Great transaction/customer service from Welcom products."
4,very comfy and very practical beach chair,"We had beach envy last year seeing the expensive rental chairs with attached footrests. We bought these for this summer for way less than the rental fee and we get to keep them. They are very comfortable to sit in. And they are very light to carry with built in backpack straps and a big pouch to hold a bunch of stuff and keep it off the sand. Our first footrest snapped right off because I was pushing it to stretch my legs. Since we got the replacement, I am careful to only use it as a rest and not push it out. My husband, kids and I all love the chairs."
3,Decent quality but lacks in comfort.,Perhaps my wife and I are a bit to critical on chairs since ours will probably be the lowest rating in the list. We received the chairs as a christmas gift (which was very thoughtful as we needed new chairs). We were very excited to see the features these chairs provided and the quality at which they were made. However the true test was using them. We opened them later that night and sat in them to watch a movie. Almost the whole time both of us squirmed around trying to get comfortable. After two hours of that we both decided these chairs need to go back and be replaced by something different.
2,Eh...,"This looked like a great idea for when I go watch outdoor movies/picnic with my family. But in reality, the chair isnt that comfortable. It doesnt sit far enough up so that you can comfortably eat. The 'table' feature is virtually useless as there is no way to stablize it. It kind of just swings around - and you cant sit up far enough to keep it stable so you cant really use it for anything. As a foot rest, it works fine. All in all, definitely not worth the price. I bought two and I figure and would return at least one of them if I didnt think the return process would be such a hassle."
2,I can't believe this many people like this chair.,"When you put your feet up, the bar in front of the chair, that the fabric attaches to, pushes up on your legs something awful.The only problem is, who else makes a high back foldable chair with a foot rest? So I try and make this chair work. 2 things I did.First was I cut the tube that attaches the footrest to the chair and placed a piece of aluminum inside, to make it telescope, so I can extend the footrest away from the chair. This can be done really easy. But a pipe cutter for like 8 bucks and buy a piece of pipe, dowel rod, etc... and put it in the middle. (Takes literally like 30 seconds for the entire process).Second, I place a cushion on the chair to elevate my legs off of the bar. The only problem is, this places upir head and arms higher in relation to head rest and chair arms.Oh yeah, I removed the cushion in the head rest and placed a smaller one in.I still am looking for another chair though,"
4,Tasty blues from an all star band,"Sherman Robertson has made himself one excellent blues album. His guitar work is exemplary and his voice is in fine form. The thing that makes the album really stand out is the group of musicians Sherman chose to make this essentially live album with. Bill Payne (of Little Feat fame) on keyboards, definitely one of the greatest keyboardists around shows he can also play the blues. Richie Hayward (Also one of the founding members of Little Feat) shows why many consider him to be the best drummer around today. Bob Glaub (famous session bassist) lays down the perfect blues beat along with Mr. Hayward. Joe Sublett (of the Texicali Horns) fills in with numerous tasty and well done horn fills. If you love the blues this album is a must for your collection."
5,One of the Best X-Villians Yet,"Omega Red has always been one of my favorite X-Baddies, and I've been rooting for him to be on the big screen ever since the X-Men movie. Alack and alas, that has not yet come to pass. We can still hold out hope for the Wolverine spin off movie.Speaking of Wolverine, Wolverine is Red's arch-nemesis, so it is great to see Red in scale with the other legends figures, like the Series 12 Astonishing X-Men Wolverine. And by in scale, I mean true to comic scale, as in towering over.This is the best Omega Red I've ever seen. The articultion is great and the tenticles, wich are identicle to the ones that the Sentinel come with, allow for many exciting posing possibilities.Aa I said, Omega Red is one of my favorite baddies, so that makes me a little biased, but this is still a great action figure."
3,Warning!,"Unfortunately, I ordered this without really reading the description. I was attempting to get a Jack and Sally set, and when I saw the picture, I thought that I was getting a real deal. The picture is actually deceiving, this product is JUST the Jack doll. However, the plush was pretty good quality so I rated it at 3 stars."
4,Okay. Not fabulous. But okay.,"A cute and witty story of women who join a self-help group, some of these songs are beautiful, some upbeat and others purely hilarious. I recommend this to women, teens and comic broadway fans."
4,A useful compilation,"A compilation of 12 articles first published in the MIT Sloan Management Review between 1993 and 2002, arranged in three parts:Innovating from the InsideInnovating with the OutsideNew Dimensions for InnovationThe articles are all of good quality and collectively cover most of the core issues of successful innovation other than a specific focus on the culture of the organization (culture is discussed within many of the articles but not as an issue in itself)."
5,satisfied,Arrived in timely manner and in good condition. I like the design and it's comfortable to wear. I like the color also
3,Aground,"Aground is about a girl named Tracy James who is trying to figure out a mystery. She leaves her home in Florida to find the reason behind why her old friends are acting so strangely. The lobsterman and his son Davey are acting odd. The lobsterman loses his business and his son Davey runs away from home. Tracy is just trying to get everything back to normal. This is a great suspense book. I recommend this book to children grades 6-9. The author Constance Leonard, has many other books which I suggest you read first before reading this book. The others books are The Marina Mystery and Stowaway."
2,Disappointed in the quality,"I was disappointed in the quality of this bench. It was put together as directions stated and it is not sturdy. It wobbles when you sit or lay on it. I would have returned it, but I threw out the box right away and didn't know how to send it back without the packaging."
5,Recommended,"I received this item within three days and I am extremely pleased with the weight bench. One negative is that it did not come with with assembly instructions, however it was not difficult at all to put together. I just enlarged the picture on here and used that for reference. I have given it 5 stars because of the quality and function of this piece of equipment. It looks great too and I love the fact that it folds up. Nicki PA"
5,Empower em20 Weight Bench,Love this bench. Small and made for a women to use. Very easy to adjust the inclines and decline.I recommend this bench to anyone with limited space. Folds up very easily (only bench I've ever seen that does that)
4,Great product for the price!,"Not too hard to assemble, the directions aren't real clear but it's fairly self-explanatory. The use of the product is great and the DVD is so easy to follow and I love that it is only a 20 min work-out, easy to do every day."
2,No assembly instructions!,I received this in a box with several pieces and lots of hardware but no assembly instructions. I ended up returning it and ordering a totally different and fully assembled bench by another company through Amazon.
2,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this phone as a primary answering machine in my home based on my two previous Unidens that I loved and have come to regret it. It's a flimsy machine with poor audio quality. What drives me nuts is the volume - I can barely hear others, but when I speak I feel like my own voice is blasting my eardrum. If I decrease the volume I have a hard time hearing the person on the other end - increase it and I have to hold the phone away from my head when I speak. Nowhere near the quality of the other (more expensive) Unidens. It was so cheap I didn't get around to returning it to Amazon. Oh well, lesson learned. Now I'm going to buy a Panasonic."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Shame on Uniden for making this piece of junk. I bought it October 4th and the unit died completely on Christmas eve... under 3 months later. While I haven't tried contacting Uniden (I'm writing this on Christmas day), it's really not worth the hassle of having it fixed. It was only $25, but for even that much it shoud have lasted longer than 2.5 months. I've loved Uniden in the past, but those have always been their more expensive models which all have great sound quality and have lasted years. This model was purchased merely because I am living away from home for several months and decided my cell phone just wasn't cutting it so I decided to get a home line and an inexpensive phone with an answering machine. Guess I should have just spent another $25 to get something that would actually last. :\"
3,Cordless Phone,"This phone works well and is, in every way but one, what I needed. My one problem is that I couldn't get proper reception in my kitchen. I switched it with one in my bedroom and that allows it to function well. Unfortunately, this leaves me with a phone in my kitchen without an answering machine; and I have to go to a different floor for my messages."
1,STAY AWAY!!!!,"I purchased this phone back in January of this year. I died in June!!! The company wanted me to pay for shipping to have it repaired. Since it only cost around 25 dollars, I just went and purchased a different phone. It is pretty bad that it did not even last a year!!! I have had Vtech phones before, and they have worked pretty well for me. Stay away from this one...it's a lemon!"
3,Rhythm Hunter,"I can't compare Rhythm Hunter to other Lewis works as a whole, but I seem to remember his music being more compelling when I heard him about 15 years ago. My CD has some skips towards the end so I can't comment about it in its entirety, but the CD in general lacked a certain level novelty and ""creative infusion"". However, that said, I'm not sure there's a bad Brent Lewis album and it's great music to have around in the background at the very least."
4,Good Manual,Good reloading manual. Very clear table layout. Lots of good data. One of the better manuals I have used. I would certainly recommend it to others.
4,Great source of information.,I've been reloading for a little over three years now. This book is a great source of information on load data. Make sure to buy several relaoding books because the data tends to differ among them due to the different calibers and powders they use.
4,Lee 2nd Edition,Just starting to build my library of loading manuals and wanted to add this one. A good place to start. It has a lot of information and will be a good reference book for a long time to come.
5,Very informative,"This manual covers practically every bullet and powder produced. Reason I purchased it was because I have a Hornady 8th edition and it didn't have info on some powders for use with their own bullets. Hard to cover all but a .40 S&W and a 10mm is the same bullet, Hornadys manual covered the 10mm with Alliants Unique but not the .40 But the Lee 2nd edition had it listed. This will be my go to 1st manual since all others are well...lacking."
1,Don't buy this book without looking at one first,I bought this book because I mistakenly assumed that since it was Lee they would have load data for their products. They don't. In fact they only have 31 reloads for lead bullets. I also like to use Unique powder which is probably one of the most popular powders on the market and they only list about 3 loads using Unique (all xtp). Why they left out one of the most popular powders baffles me and why they didn't include their own products baffles me. I consider this purchase a total waste of money since it doesn't contain any reload data that I will ever need. Of course this is just my opinion and If I can keep anyone else that uses Unique exclusively like I do from wasting their hard earned money then that's a good thing. I would like to add that I used only Lee products for reloading and except for this book I've been very happy.
2,"Good data tables, but reads like an advertisement for Lee.","The first quarter of the book reads like an advertisement for Lee reloading equipment. It's shoved down your throat to a point where it's difficult to glean any information from all the marketing garbage. I don't think you can find 3 consecutive sentences which don't tout the superiority of Lee equipment or suggest you buy a specific Lee product. If you're looking for a good, unbiased intro to reloading, this isn't it. If you're looking for a good, comprehensive set of data tables on cartridge loads, or if you're a huge Lee fan and never plan on buying a piece of equipment made by a manufacturer other than Lee, this book is for you."
1,Do not buy for relaoding data!,"I bought this book for reloading data, and they don;t even list the ubiquitous ""Unique""WTF? A total waster of money. Not of any use to me what soever.If you use Lee Dies and equipment you may want it for that info."
3,Modern Reloading 2nd Edition Review,"I have to agree with others that this is clearly an advertisement for Lee products. Had they left out the advertising I would have given it 4 stars (5 stars if spending less time advertising meant more time explaining in better detail).You're sure to get sick of reading the word ""Lee"" over and over, but if you get this book just for the reloading data, it's a good book."
4,Lee 2nd Edition Reloading Manual,"I bought this and a few others to replace manuals that were ""lost"" during our last move. I use this and all of my handloading manuals primarily to cross check data, especially when loading for a cartridge that is new to me. Although there is a lot of data about Lee products in this book, there is also a tremendous amount of information explaining how things work. This is presented in an easily understood format that should be very helpful to a beginning handloader.I'd hoped that the 2009 reprint would have included some of the newer rifle cartridges like the 204 Ruger, 6.5 Grendel and the 6.5 Creedmoor. They've been around long enough that data is available from several sources that could have been verified for this version."
5,Reloaders Bible,"If you load your own ammo, this book is a must-own.Full of more than 40 years of experience for Richard Lee, founder of Lee Precision, Inc.While this book is really keyed for users of Lee equipment, the wisdom contained within the pages, as well as the most comprehensive load data available in bound form, makes this CHEAP book worthwhile for all reloading enthusiasts."
4,excellent,"This is Coltrane in 1960, between bands and about to move from Atlantic to Impulse.This is a hard bop album, with a few ballads. The music here is not as advanced as Giant Steps, and certianly nothing like what he was about to undertake. But hearing Trane manouver so niblely around this straightforward matertal is still a joy--you can hear the brillance of his soloing""Harmonesque"" has a dissonent half step base, perhaps the first hint at adventuring into the avant gaurde. I wonder if Trane knew just how far out he was about to go."
5,Amazon's track listing is wrong!,Great album! There are 8 tracks on the audio cassette:1. Little Old Lady2. Village Blues3. My Shining Hour4. Fifth House5. Harmonique6. Like Sonny7. I'll Wait and Pray8. Some Other Blues
4,Trane in a Traditional Setting - Pretty Good,"He's playing in a traditional quartet setting, with Miles' rhythm section behind him, and it sounds nice. It's a good record, if not the most adventurous (to be honest the best track is the one that looks forward, with Jones on drums and Tyner on piano - ""Village Blues"")."
1,This C.D. was a sorry excuse for Rockabilie.,This was a bland taste of what Rockabilie has to offer. I thought it was awfull.
2,"Okay, but too large","It works fine, but is much larger than other options...even other options from iGo."
5,A True confession of Enlightenment,"This book is simply not to be missed by anyone.It is so powerful, it will surely change your life in many ways.""The Knee of Listening"" is a clearly expressed description of an incomparable spiritual journey.Buy it, find it, Read it without delay !"
1,BOOTLEG DVD,"If you are a fan of the band, be warned. By buying this (and other unauthorized so-called Eagles product), you are supporting bootleggers who have illegally reproduced poor quality footage and previously released content that is actually owned by other companies, including the Eagles. The band is not involved in any way with this or the other products and has no control over the content or its quality. The band receives no compensation for the pirated use of the content. If you are unhappy with the quality of DVD, return it to Amazon, and get your money back. Amazon is responsible for allowing its site to host traffickers of pirated and counterfeit product. Complain to them. Maybe then they would cease the practice and protect you and your dollars from being wasted by the rip-offs."
4,Work great,"I had this kind of Steamer before and like it very much, but accidentally burned it completely. Bed&Bath; (where I originally purchased the steamer from) does not carry this type any more, instead they only carry those bigger in shape with long handles which could be locked together. I do not like the new type because the locked handles are easy to be pushed back into my food after I put on the pot lid.I am happy that I could purchase the same steamer on line and resume the happiness. It shipped fast and functions right as expected. The only drawback is that this new steamer is not perfectly round shaped: a small slice (3cm * 2mm) is missing from the edge, which somehow looks like being cut off intentionally."
5,Great Steamer,"I love the silicone steamer. Because of the flexible material, it is easy to fit into many size pots. The handles are nice for grabbing to remove once finished steaming. Also...for a quick weeknight meal, this can be used in the microwave, unlike the stainless one I have."
2,Still mystified...,"Ok gang, maybe someone can help me with this one. After seeing the steamer at a friends, I ordered one as soon as I could.Wonderfully steamed vegetables, no funky tastes, YET! I have yet to be able to remove the steamer without the contents spilling back into the pot, or on the counter. After numerous tries.When I try to remove the steamer using the two loops, it creates a roll effect that wedges itself into any pot I own, and eventually while tugging, one end slips out, and the contents roll out the other end.I guess I have to use a stock pot to be able to steam a few sprigs of broccoli. Color me confused..."
1,Smells Like Perfume,"I bought this device and was excited about microwaving veggies using it. Well, it imparted a perfumy smell into my broccoli. OK. I accepted the blame. I washed it more thoroughly. I soaked it. I wrapped it in newspaper. I sprinkled it with baking soda. Nothing worked. Still smells like perfume.At this point, I don't know what I'm going to do with it. I put it in the cabinet to see if the smell will go away. Cross your fingers for me.Think about this before you buy."
4,did have an odd taste,"I tried my veggie steamer today for the first time, and like the one bad review, my vegetables did have a strange taste to them. However, the strange taste was very much like what Bed Bath and Beyond (where I bought the steamer) smells like when you walk in.. it's hard to describe. However, I have high hopes. It probably just needs a thorough boiling or run through the dishwasher before use to get rid of any odors it absorbed. I had only washed it by hand with soap before using it."
1,Do NOT buy this,"When I first saw this steamer, I loved it. How colorful and versatile it is!I tried to check where it was made because I usually don't buy something made in China (especially if it's food or something for cooking). But, Amazon does not provide this type of information.Anyway, I ordered it since it looks so good and many people wrote good reviews.First of all, you should aware that it is MADE IN CHINA.Second, it stinks, literally.I hoped the smell goes away after I washed it thoroughly and boiled it in water for a while.I even used it a few times to steam vegetables and dumplings.But, guess what? It still stinks. I don't think it's safe to eat something steamed in this steamer.Do not buy this unless you want to use it for decoration.I finally got a stainless steamer and threw this silicone steamer away."
3,Memories of St. Lucia,"I worked as the sound engineer for Club Med in St. Lucia during the summer of '99 and this was quite a popular song. Although I find it a little generic for the genre, it was a real crowd pleaser at the disco. The groove and overall feel of this track make it perfect for patio and pooside gatherings, setting a tone of tropical escapism."
4,size doesn't matter(trust me),"well when i got this book i couldn't believe that this little booklet actually had any effective information but when i read it i changed my opinion, this book is a complete guide to the evocation of spirits into a black mirror, however some of the instructions are not very clear for example place the mirror in the triangle & then position the candles in such a way that the seer can see her/him self how can this be accomplished if the mirror is facing upwards & the seer is in a circle??? other that this the booklet is very good & i highly recommend it. one more thing, the seer can be both male or female and this kind of evocation can be practiced by a single person too, contrary to what the book says. keep practicing until you succeed."
5,Highly Enjoyable.,"This book is a great visual experience. The flower arrangements are very pretty, the instructions are top notch, being step by step on the inside flap of the fold out pages. This is a highly creative learning experience. I definately reccomend this book for those looking for elegant simplicity. I am very happy with my purchase of this book."
3,Won't work on Western Digital external drives,"I bought this hoping it would allow me to use my Western Digital My Book SE on my Asus A8N-SLI, but it does not work. The Western Digital requires a true eSATA connection from the motherboard. What this does is convert SATA to eSATA and that won't cut it for the WD drive."
2,would not recommend!~.........,Stiff uncomfortable runs small pointy everything I don't like in a bra....would not recommend buying this one!~ No thanks!~ I will try another brand!~
4,Writing for Publication,This book came as described in the add. I very much appreciated the speed in which it arrived. So far it has been very useful in my class.
1,Cannibal,"Awful movie...never should have bought it but I was curious about what cannibalism was all about. I couldn't watch certain scenes...as they were too graphic. The actors and acting did not appeal to me at all. The movie was so bad...I landed up tossing it out after viewing it. Ugly, trashy, disturbing...these are just some of the adjectives I would use to describe it...if you want to learn more about cannibalism, Grimm Story is a better movie to view...with better actors, an interesting story line and better script. Do not waste your money on this disgusting movie. The plot and everything about it sucks!"
1,"Interesting for perverted people, but rates very poor from a filmlovers point of view.","Marian Dora for sure is not a gifted cinematographer.I don't like to see puppets hanging around in trees. Some awkward scenes even made me burst out in laughter. (These particular scenes unfortunatelywere meant seriously, it appears.)I found my purchase to be a waste of money. But if you're a really sick individual, and a really lonely homosexual person with cannibalistictendencies and looking forward to what must be one of the worstmelodramatic and cliché-ridden pieces of perverted pellicular crap,this one for sure is a must-see for you."
2,waste of money,I bought this movie because i have seen the original movie (Grimm Love) this one is really bad and cheap and boring don't go 4 it the original is way much better.
5,I personally look for the most disturbing horror movies I can watch,"This one, too this date...is it!and to realize, it is a TRUE story.I hope they soon re-release this movie due to the ridiculousresale for the first and out of print edition.I am keeping this review completly simpleso watch it!!!"
1,THIS MOVIE IS SO BAD THE PRODUCER SHOULD BE ARRESTED,"I thought that ""Showgirls"" was the worst movie ever made until I paid twenty bucks on Amazon for this clunker. A German movie dubbed with British accents did nothing to enhance this movie. Childish tricks done with cranberry juice and raspberry jello were so disgusting that I almost vomited. The strange part is that I was actually aroused for the first part of this movie and then became totally impotant for the remainder. I should have taken my money and threw it down the toilet!! dennisthemenace48 on ebay........Dennis"
1,this is not a horror movie...it's a love story,"I was under the impression that this is a horror movie; but it isn't. This movie is actually a love story. The men meet when one places an ad looking for someone to be his victim so to speak. The two men meet and discover that one wants to eat and the other wants to be eaten. The first part of the movie is about the men getting to know eachother then having sex. The other half is about the one man trying to eat the other. I am not offended by the gore or nature of the film....the reason for the sad review is that this film is BORING!! There is only a few minutes of dialogue in the entire film so you don't get a feel for the characters, the few words that are spoken seem rather cardboard and it would have been nice for the film to include a few facts about the court case considering this is German's first case of cannibalism and since the victim was willing the courts could not charge him with murder."
2,ok,one of the rings works as intended but the package makes no sense. it's crazy to purchase 3 rings that are different sizes. each time u buy the package u have to throw away 2 out of 3 rings. it would make much more sense if they sold 3 of the same rings in each package. i would then rate the product with 5 stars.
4,"Hey, it works","While not the most elegant solution, it does work, and it lasts. Which makes it a whole lot cheaper than Viagra, after the second time you use it."
5,Yukino Hana,"I came to know Nakashima Mika after listening to Youtube video of her hit ""Yukino Hana."" This DVD is a good orientation session for me to know more about her musical talent and style. Mika is really a great singer with some mysterious charm in her voice. She has Britney Spear's photogenic look, but has more powerful and attractive voice color. Now I like her songs even better. Money well spent! The seller in Korea is very fast in shipping this DVD. Absolutely satisfied."
2,my kids are not impressed,"My son (6)loves music, and this book does not hold his interest at all.I was disappointed to hear the word stupid or ugly ( I forgot which right now). I don't see why it had to be included in such a quality product from such a great company."
1,Defect delivery,"I ordered this item because my daughter, almost 5, loves music and i want to teach her a lot about classical music. unfortunately the delivery (cartridge) was defect and i can't return as i am living in switzerland. i got the money back but i am still disappointed."
5,Great introduction to Music!,"Based on the reviews here I decided to buy this for my 3 year old and see what he thought. Although designed for older kids, he LOVES this book. He's able to recognize intruments in contemporary music and really enjoys the different music styles he's exploring in this book. He tells me if a song he selects is scary or funny or silly. This book is allowing him to appreciate the many forms of music and I see its impact when we listen to music on the stereo or radio. A great buy!"
2,Not as Fun as others,"I got this book for my son with his Quantum Pad at Christmas. He got several others and likes most of them. The music one, however is his least favorite. I had been told that this was one of the best, so was surprised and looked at it myself. The problem is that many of the 'game' segments are quite similar and my son got tired of doing the same thing over and over. The info. is good but kids can get bored with this one."
5,Excellent product,This is the best of the LeapPad books I have seen. My four-year old has spent hours on it. It's very interactive and covers a lot of ground for that age. Highly recommended.
5,Look ma...no leaks!,"We bought this last year before going on a cruise. Follow the simple instructions. Lightly grease the O-ring (with the included tube of silicone grease) before each use and you're good to go. So far it has been perfect for swimming, snorkeling, boating, rainy day hiking, and keeping the sand and salt spray out of the camera on the beach. We always wait until we get back to fresh clean water, rise, and blot dry, before opening it and have never had a problem. Also, ALL of the camera controls are remoted thru the case so the is no loss of function with your camera.One peripheral consideration is that we have experimented with a wide variety of batteries for our electronics and will never use anything other than the Energizer E2's. the have over double the life of any other battery we have tried in our electronics."
5,Caesar revisited,"What can I say? I was impressed. Suetonius was a Hadrian historian with an eye to the scandalous. Throughout his writing, he paints a consise history while insinuating certain rumors via the elusive ablative absolute. He is the source of many famous stories such as Nero singing as Rome burns in his Life of Divus Nero or Caesar's final words to Brutus in Divus Julius: ""kai soi teknon;"". Butler and Cary's commentary in this volume offers great historical background. If you want grammatical help though, you should seek out the Westcott commentary. Overall though, I have enjoyed this account of the first Caesar's life greatly. Vini Vidi Vici!"
1,You Get What You Pay For ... Be Warned,This recording is of such poor quality that you'll regret ever buying it. Sounds like it was done on a portable tape deck. I have many Hawkwind recordings and love most of them ... but this one was so bad I had to get rid of it.Buy ... In Search of Space || Doremi Fasol Latido || Warrior at the Edge of Time || Hall of the Mountain GrillAnd the most important of all ....A SPACE RITUAL (2 CD)
1,Incomplete Copies of 4? Titles,"At first I got excited that I got CD versions of not 3, but 4 live releases for a very low price, at least at face value. But... the Text of Festival is incomplete, leaving out the enire Sides 3 and 4, extended jams, the main reason for having Text of Festival. Also, the Masters of the Universe is an exact copy of the incomplete Text of Festival disc. So, either they made a mistake and printed the Masters disc twice, or it's from France. The cover does say three discs; the back track lists the four mentioned above. Go figure. Still you end up with Bring Me the Head of Yuri Gagoran (bootleg quality), a true copy of Space Ritual 2, and this incomplete Text of Festival. (See others' reviews of these seperately.) I feel cheated on this one. The only worse Hawkwind buy is Codename Hawkwind-2000 a similar butchering of original official(?) bootleg versions. Even (if not especially) Hawkwind fans should stay away from this one."
2,Hawkwind-'Entire&Infinite Universe Of...' (Dressed To Kill),"The only reason I've giving this 4-CD box set release a two-star rating instead of just one,is that 'Entire...' has the 'Text Of Festivals' CD(see my review of that disc)within it's 4-CD box set.I believe that MAY be the title that 'Entire...' ends up having two(2) copies of.One major downside about 'Entire...' is that since it is,in fact a 4-CD box set,it takes up entirely to MUCH room on anyone's music rack,shelf,etc.It could've easily been edited down to a 2-CD release.Some advise for the people at the Dressed To Kill label,LOOK/LISTEN...check out the material more closely the NEXT time you want to put out a release like this.Their 'In Search Of Space:'60's To '70's' 3-CD box set,now that's an interesting collection of music.Has a wide variety of artists.Two thirds of the tunes on that box set are actually good."
2,A poorly done biography of a blues legend.,"There are so many poorly researched segments in this biography, that to list them would be too lengthy. Half of the book is biography, the other half academic deconstructions of Minnie's songs. The first 30 years of her life is nearly absent; questions remain unanswered even after that. The one good thing about this work, is that there's all sorts of room left for someone to write a definitive--or even near definitive--biography of this great blues singer and song writer."
1,A reason to turn on the TV,"The writing is pallid. The illustrations are numbingly bad. This is an excellent example of what a children's book should not be -condescending, smarmy, hollow and hokey. If it weren't for Julie Andrews Edwards' name on the cover, this book would be a hard sell at a vanity press. Julie, Julie, Julie! This regrettable foray is to children's literature what your topless scene in ""Victor, Victoria!"" was to drama. Only the topless scene made more sense.Please, spare the lives of future trees and brain cells. Let Dumpy be pulped.(...)"
3,A bit verbose. Have to sift out the essentials.,"I bought a few books simultaneously. I started reading this one first. I'm sure it's thorough, but there seems to be a lot of superfluous information in here that really is not needed but appears to be ""filler"". I'm looking forward to finishing the book (so I can start the next one). Still, for this price, a good collection to the library."
4,Essential Wilderness Navigator Book,"The book is well organized and informative. Although I have not yet finished reading the entire book, the parts I have read were well written. There were numerous illustrations to help explain the text. The appendix lists other books and sources of related information."
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"Vendetta Red is a band that does have some potential and shows signs of it on this album. It seems to me, however, they are too concerned with trying to use big words in their songs rather than making good music. I do think lyrics are important, but it sounds like the lead singer tried to put words in at random where they don't really fit to sound smart and profound. Sometimes simplicity is a good thing, especially when singing about topics this band sings about. I also can't stand when the lead singer screams. It is probably the most annoying sound I've ever heard. It may even surpass the sound Jim Carrey made in Dumb and Dumber. This group does have potential so keep an eye on them, download Shatterday, and hope the next album is better. I don't recommend buying this album."
5,yay,"Vendetta Red has great lyrics, great tunes, and great energy. These guys are awesome live, and a lot of that spirit is captured in this kickinCD."
5,Amazing New Band,I recomend Between The Never And The Now. I purcashed this cd a month ago and I havent been able to stop listening to it. Their sound is just very unique. I highly believe they are going to break through the New Wave scence on top. Pick up the cd and check them out on warped tour this year. You wont regret it
5,Between The Never And The Now,WOW!! Vendetta Red does it again. What a great album! I saw them live in the Seattle area and can't wait for them to come back. But this great new album will defintiley do until then. Buy this one now!
2,Dissapointed once again,"Why only two? Because of the incoherent screaming placed unstrategically where it just isn't mean to go. But on the plus side, not every song on this album has screaming, therefore not every song sucks. I liked ""There Only Is"" until the middle 15 seconds of screaming, then I was laughing my ass off again. Good lyrics, good music, even good singing. I think these ""emo"" bands should be engineering their songs to allow the screaming to either;A. Make sense in the placement within the song (Or ask yourselves, ""Does it make sense to scream at this point? Or are we screaming just for the sake of trying to identify with teen angst?""B. Why are we screaming? Don't have a great song running along the tracks and all of a sudden put a H-bomb where ever you like.In other words, try crafting your song to make sense.Shatterday was a great example of that. Perfect anthem song. I'm going to keep my ears on this band. Potential for stronger albums in the future."
5,Promising major label debut for an awesome band,"this album is a great addition to any rock lovers' cd collection. every song is great from beginning to end. the guitars roar, circle and sweep, the drums pound and sooth, and the bass pops and bounces and to top it off are zach davidsons' abstract, surreal, lyrics adding up to one sweet sound. the opener is emo-ish, while ""Opiate Summer"", ""Caught you like a cold"" and ""Por Vida"" are rockers that grind and burn ""Shatterday"" is a huge singalong anthem, ""Accident sex"" and ""Ambulance Chaser"" are slow, building up before exploding. ""Suicide party"" and ""Lipstick tourniquets"" remind me of the late At The Drive-in. the worst song in my opinion is the last one, but it's real easy to skip"
4,New Fave. Band,"Vendetta Red, the Seattle-based rock band has just released Between The Never And The Now, their first world-wide release. This CD fits with the styles and likings of the Warped Tour crowd, who listen to The Used and The Ataris. The whole album has a unique style and sound that is very distinguishable. ""Shatterday"" is the quintessential first single, that appeals to everyone. The surprise hit will most definitely be ""Opiate Summer,"" the rock world's version of a love song; regardless the song will end up on repeat. The college world meets Seattle sound on this CD, which creates a completely unique feel. This will not be the last heard from Vendetta Red."
3,depends on what you are looking for,"this album is good, if you know what you are getting yourself into. on this site, vendetta red is associated with mars volta, one of my all time favorite bands. if you like bands like them, cave in, autumn to ashes, this is the wrong cd--run. iwas very dissapointed--esp.by shatterday, which everyone seems to think is soo good. if you love every band you saw at the warped tour (including good charlotte) this is a good buy."
1,You've got to be kidding me...,"If these jerks ripped At the Drive-In off any more with their stage show, they'd be liable to get sued... oh wait, that already HAPPENED. And the music is godawfully boring and derivative... get into something with some kind of substance... this is the worst record ever made by anyone, i think. There's not really much else to say that, since it's terrible, it figures that tons of stupid American Teenagers will eat this audiopoop up..."
3,hmmm,"i have to say the same thing as the last guy that wrote a review of this album. i use to see these guys around town and watch there other bands. i recognized ""Por Vida"" as a Plebian Cry song (it was my fav Plebian Cry song when they were around, and Plebian Cry did a better job with it). i have the first Vendetta Red 6 song demo, its got some of these songs, and the demo was better than this. i guess if i was a first time listener of Vendetta Red this album would be a 10, but since i was a fan of early Vendetta Red, Plebian Cry, Only You, and Farewell Spacecadet, i saw how they sounded before they went a little more poppy. they are still a great band though. so its almost hard to rate this."
1,Sick,"When the cookware arrived, I think someone had used it or returned it, because it had some cooked on food still in the bottom. Sick."
2,The Game of Repackaging,"Released in 2002, it is yet another in what has become a long list of compilation albums posthumously released after Miles Davis passed away in 1991.The terrain covered is typical - the pre-electric years of 1956-1968, with a later cover of Time After Time tossed onto the album - with only the most meticulous collector wanting this for a digital remix of Fran-Dance (Putting Your Little Right Foot Out).This is a game of repackaging which can be viewed as a sampler for the uninitiated or a crass means for a major label to keep churning out ""new"" releases from an iconic artist. If you decide upon the latter, the mood is for green...not blue."
4,Pure power pop fun!,"Whatever happened to this band? I was a teenager when I stumbled across this album. I do not think they made it very big, (like The Knack). I never got rid of my records, but I did get rid of my turntable-until TODAY! After 15 years without a record player I bought one today. I put this record on and it sounds as fresh as it ever did! Power pop in the line of The Records,The Ramones, The Jags, you got it right? If you are a little younger, think the Hives, with a little less attitude and a little more pop. Every song on this is a catchy pop tune that will stick in your head and have you humming happy thoughts!If you are a young band, I would cover some of these songs. they were overlooked 24 years ago, but I can easily see these songs gaining popularity! ""Rock n' Roll Girl"" and ""I don't fit In"" are two of the best teen angst pop songs written form those times!"
5,A great resource for those active in robotics,"This book is an excellent addition to the scientific literature. It includes an extensive discussion of scholarly and practical robotic topics ranging from kinematics and programming to practical application areas and economic concerns. The editor has complied 66 chapters of information from 120 contributors. As one who has edited books and journals, I can appreciate the task in getting over 100 contributors to commit to this undertaking.The handbook is over 1300 pages long and includes a CD which allows one to see many of the operations described in the printed matter in a very visual fashion. The book is divided into 12 parts with the section on terminology containing over 800 terms. I personally was delighted to see chapters included on micro and nanorobotics reflecting the developments and interest in miniaturization. This book is highly recommened."
5,An excellent book!,This book is exceptionally inspiring. It is wonderful to be able to hear the ideas and experiences of these incredible Production Designers. The interviews bring light to the important role these accomplished men and women played in the world of moviemaking. If you are interested in the art of film making this book is the real thing. You will learn a lot. I love this book!
4,Very Good Game,"This game is the same as Riven, but instead of 5 CDs, there is only 1 DVD, which makes the games much more playable, as you don't have to switch CDs ever. As for gameplay, this game is great. Fun puzzles, great graphics, and its one of the only games I've played that makes you think. The only reason I gave this game 4 stars is because it doesn't run in Windows 2000, and tech support wouldn't even give me 1 word of advice on how to make it work."
3,"A good game, but terrible replay value","I enjoy playing the Myst games once through, they are fun and challenging. However my computer would not allow me to hit a certain switch for some reason, and I was therefore never able to get to the location on the cover. Even if I had, I would never play the game again, I would know how to do everything, and therefore, what would be the point? At least it is better then Myst in which you can win within about 15 minutes of starting the game, but still... Any 60 dollar game (as it was when it was released) should last longer than this. With the detail put in, the game itself is rather short, with puzzle solving accounting for much of your time. Also some puzzles can be so frustrating when you know what to do, but can't (the stopping the scopes thing, the puzzle at the top of the dome on the first island). I thought it was a beautiful game, but I wouldn't get it unless it is below 20 dollars, otherwise I don't really think it's worth it."
1,Riven,"I enjoyed playing Myst. I was so excited that Riven was a sequel. Boy was I disappointed. I felt as if I just went around in circles. In Myst, you searched for pages. In Riven, it seems as if you are searching for something unknown. Gave the game away."
4,A Unique Musical,"The thing about Falsettos as a whole is that it's completely different from most other musicals. There are songs in several styles, from heart wrenching ballads to big and brassy to a random conga line. And talk about touching! ""I Never Wanted to Love You"" is amazing! The story is really Marvin's, a man who ""discovers"" that he's gay; about his relationships with his ex-wife, his lover, and, most importantly, his son."
3,Worse than the other volumes,"Briefly, this particular volume of TTF (generally a great series) has a lot of weak tracks and is not worth getting. I recommend that you look at some of the earlier releases, especially Vol. 12. Also don't think that just because they're older they're not worth getting, because the best trance anthems were actually written around '99-'00, in the era of Epic and Uplifting Trance."
2,NOT a Kid's Review,"The sound quality of this CD is unbelievably bad. It sounds muffled, and it's full of hisses and pops.Half the CD is work from The Hassles, and if you don't like them you might as well just buy Cold Spring Harbor, which has all of Billy's songs with 10x better quality.This CD is a dud for everybody but the die-hard Joel fans."
2,Not Satisfied,"It wasn't a week before a string broke. This guitar is cheaper, but I guess you get what you pay for. I bought it to see if my daughter would like it to take lessons and now I have to buy strings and pegs to make that possible."
2,Out of date information regarding accessible gardening,"I was disappointed in the content of this book. It merely covers basic gardening. I was hoping it would cover some tips on accessible gardening for people with disabilities. It does mention some ideas on how to achieve that but the techniques they offer is outdated. The techniques they mention usually require costly physical modifications which can be somewhat frustrating to pursue. If you are really interested in gardening but have some physical limitations, there are products out there that are already adapted to your needs. There are many gardening tools that have extended and ergonomically desinged handles at Home Depot. There are also products that are ergonomically desinged if you have arthritis. Its better to do an internet search for these up to date products that spending a dollar on this book. Buy yourself a real gardening book and do an internet search on how to modify your garden and your tools."
1,Not brilliant at all!,"I am in the process of reading all 17 or 18 Rona Jaffe novels in chronological order from the first (The Best of Everything) until the last (Room-mating Season).After I was so disappointed from ""The Other Woman"", I was expecting more from ""The Fame Game"".However, Gerry's experiences didn't interest me.I must say that authors like Jacqueline Susann (Valley of the Dolls) and Grace Metalious (Return to Peyton Place) have covered this topic much much better than Miss Jaffe.One star is the most I can rate for this book.I'm hoping that ""Family Secrets"" will be a lot better in comparison.""Class Reunion"" is without any doubt Jaffe's master piece and I'm not expecting to find another novel that will compel me as much, but I'm now hoping for a novel that will be a lot better than ""The Best of Everything"", ""The Other Woman"", ""The Fame Game"" and ""Mazes and Monsters"".I can only agree with the other reviewer Tawn Tawn that this is not a brilliant book at all. Too bad!"
4,WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR...,"This is simply a trashy, enjoyable novel about the entertainment industry, with its preoccupation with money, sex, and drugs. The author tells a cautionary tale about life in the fast lane, and the things that can happen when one falls prey to the call of the fame game.The characters are diverse, as are the storylines that bind them. I can't say that any one of the characters is particularly compelling or likable, but their stories will most certainly keep the reader turning the pages to see what happens to them. The book is definitely a guilty pleasure. Fans of Jacqueline Susann and Jackie Collins will, undoubtedly, enjoy this book."
4,VERY GOOD BOOK,"Very good book, basically two major problems for Africa are aid and cooperation, that should be eliminated completely and have given this fantastic continent a donor depending mentality; where his people for hundred of years have seen the white man and the rich countries as someone to extort money to and the world is also complicit to it. The second problem is the extended family mentality that causes nepotism and corruption, as i personally saw also in my own country italy. Generally excellent book, a bit too long and complex, maybe mr Hollaway need to be a bit more to the point. This book could have been written using half the pages.Paolo Genovesi"
3,nice introduction to Goblin,"DRG have given a nice intro to the works of Goblin and as the series progesses, you see more outtakes and examples from other, more obscure albums."
4,dance with the devils,"awesome horror prog from the italian masters! all the ""hits"" are here, the themes from Profundo Russo, Suspiria, Tenebre. Goblin's songs are full of haunting atmosphere and creepy hooks, but also plenty of songs feature romantic ambience and even some funky disco influence creeps in on a few numbers. now that is scary."
1,incorrect answers,"Just to give an idea of a major problem with this book, I'd like to point out Game 52. In this game, three piano players must learn exactly three of six pieces. In the instructions it says, ""Each piece is learned by at least one, but not more than two of the students...""For the first question pertaining to game 52, it asks ""Which of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the pieces learned by the three students?""The answer key indicates that the correct response is (A) Ali: 2,3,5; Ben: 3,4,6; Claire: 2,5,6.Does anyone see the problem with this answer supposedly being the correct choice? It doesn't have any of the students learning piece #1, despite the fact the rules stated, ""each piece is learned by at least one, but not more than two of the students...""Obviously this is a clear mistake. It also leaves me with very little confidence in the book as a whole. If it has one mistake, who's to say it doesn't have numerous other mistakes?"
1,Trust me-much better books are out there!,"A few weeks before the LSAT, I was desperate for different prep material and logic games were still making me nervous, so I bought this book. BIG mistake. First of all, it doesn't contain real LSAT material, so it makes no sense to spend your precious time on it (real LSAT questions are expensive to use, so this author tried to recreate them--and did a terrible job. Not only are there lots of mistakes which just confuse you more when trying to prepare, ""none of the above"" is never even an answer choice on the LSAT!!). Its explanations of how to diagram and set up the games are also really bad. Many are clunky and others lack proper explanations. Definitely choose the Logic Games Bible (Powerscore) over this one. I really regret spending this money!"
2,error-filled yet challenging,"as other say, full of errors. I am only on game 12 and have found a number of incorrect answers on the logic games. Though, I just sent emails to the company and do not know of their responsiveness. Still, I do not recommend this book to anyone."
1,"Waste of Money, Waste of Time","This book is a rip off, and you should avoid it like the plague.The problems aren't from actual LSATs, they're created by the REA. This means you'll spend a lot of time working through problem types that won't appear on the test, and you won't cover a lot that will. They also just feel different than actual LSAT problems, and are substantially more difficult, though not in an educational way.This book is riddled with errors. Some of the rules for the games directly contradict, making entire problem sets worthless. Some of the answers are incorrect, too, although it's impossible to tell because they don't diagram any of the problems out. Instead, enormous blocks of text attempt to walk you through the problem but ultimately just make it more confusing.I'd give this a zero if Amazon let me, there's no reason to buy it."
1,Nothing like real LSAT problems,"I've done all the games on the 58 released LSATs.With that said, I can conclusively say that the games in this book are NOTHING and I mean, *nothing* like those you will find on today's LSATs.However, if you like puzzles and brain teasers, are the kind of person to play Sudoku on your commute, then this book might be a nice source of entertainment. But as LSAT prep, your time and money are better spent elsewhere.By the way, I didn't find many typos. Maybe one. That was really it."
1,"Worst Edit on Record/Want to be Frustrated, buy this book","I am currently working on puzzle 59 of 100. Multiple mistakes have been made in the book, sometimes in the questions, sometimes in the answers. Common sense allows you to solve some of the discrepancies, but... I bought the book to solve these problems, not create more.I've used multiple tools for LSAT preparation, and while this is still a fun book of games, I need it for LSAT prep, not to play sodoku better. As far as prep materials, this is one of the worst. An absolute MUST NOT PURCHASE.REA, GET SOME EDITORS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Filled with errors, ZERO customer support","The structure of the book seems promising as the explanation for each logic game gives an initial ""set-up"" description to guide your approach and then the complete solution.However, this book is chock-full of errors. This alone wouldn't be fatal if the book had an errata sheet or responsive customer support. I sent multiple emails in an attempt to contact customer support about the errors I continued to encounter, but never heard back once. Contrast this to Kaplan and Curvebreakers, both of which had errata sheets as well as responsive customer support teams.I would not recommend the REA book to anybody. If you're in doubt, try a few games for 15-20 minutes in the bookstore before you buy to see for yourself."
4,"Flawed, yet it's a must have for LSAT preparation","This book has been helpful for 2 reasons:1. The problems are the same style as the ones on the LSAT, but MUCH harder. The scenarios and rules are more convoluted. Therefore they are great practice material.2. There's 100 of them. You won't find more problems in any other single book.I would recommend reading the Logic Games Bible first, then using this as practice. And DO NOT WORRY ABOUT TIME on these games, since they are way harder than real LSAT logic games.BTW, there are some errors, but I don't think as many as other people have suggested. Specifically the answers of Game 15 I believe are wrong, but I haven't found other mistakes so far. But what you really need to get better at logic games is hard practice through deep thinking, and this book will provide that."
2,Could be great with better editing,"The layout of the book is good: problems, setup and solutions separated so that you can work each set out, then get solution hints before checking for the answers. The problem-solving guidance is well-founded, and the general premise is strong; committed practice yields stronger scores.However, the problem-solving instruction is wordy and vague, with poorly written instructional steps and explanations. The instructions also suffer when the text describes the use of specific diagrams which are never drawn out.Even so, I only decided to return this book when I found substantial errors in three of the first 15 puzzles I tried. Because of these errors, some of the questions had more than one correct answer, or the answer listed as correct violated at least one of the rules.I do not recommend purchasing this book before corrections are issued."
2,Go with Logitech,"I'm paying the price for buying a ""cheap"" wireless combo. Definitely stick to Logitech for input devices.First of all, the keyboard is a little too sensitive, so if you type quickly, you end up making lots of errors. I would prefer a slightly stiffer feel to the keys. Battery life for the keyboard is fine.However, I have to agree with Brian's review. The mouse's battery life is horrible. Not only do they use AAA batteries instead of AA, they go through a set in about two weeks. That's utterly ridiculous.All in all, I'm thinking about returning this set and buying a Logitech combo instead. Stay away from Kensington products, or at least this one. Don't be fooled by the price."
2,Mouse eats batteries,"The keys are stiff, but ok. I'm hoping they losen up with more use. The mouse, however is horrible. Despite the keyboard still being on the fist set of batteries, I have to replace the batteries on the mouse at least every two weeks. I have rechargables, so it's not that big a deal, but this is really inefficient. It's also really heavy and the mouse tracking resolution/speed is not very good either. Spend the money and get Microsoft or Logitech."
2,The mouse is horrible,"I do hate the mouse, for the following reasons:(1) It's too heavy, feel pretty bad for my hand. Logitechs are much better.(2) Very un-sensitive for my hand's movement. It let me feel I need to use ""power"" to move(3) The driver is awful. Sometime the mouse pointer will be locked in the right corner of the screen and the restart of the machine is the only way I can find to make it work.(4) For the same price, I would go for Logitech or M$.Final word: Try to test a real one before buying."
4,Where is the button??,"The price is right. I hooked it up and hit the connect button on the mouse and that worked right away. I could not find the connect button on the keyboard and there is no user manual and there is no information on this model on their website. Luckily I read one of the other reviews here and the person said the button is in a obscure place and they were right. It is on the bottom of the keyboard. You have to flip up the keyboard stand tab and the button is under there. Once I found it, I hit the button and both the keyboard and mouse are working fine. I just hooked it up today so I can't speak to battery life yet, but it came with batteries so that was also a plus. Good luck!"
1,Hopeless Keyboard,"This should be avoided by every means. My XP wouldnt see the Keyboard at all. Neither the USB nor the PS2 version worked. I fell for the ceap price, you should not."
1,Junk,I bought this for the price. You get what you pay for. The mouse is not smooth moving at all and the battery life is real bad. Also loses connection. Spend the extra money for something better.
4,I am Happy with this one,"I got this key board and mouse and tried to plug it, Had a scare initially but, finally when I called the Techsupport for Kensington, they cleared my problem in a minute. I felt that the product is worth a lot more than it costs, but it would have been helpful if there was a product manual with instructions to use this. The connect button on the keyboard is obscure, so I had to call the Tecsupport. But I amnow quite happy that I got this wireless combo for so cheap. I suggest to call Techsupport if you have problems and no panic."
5,Makes a great food for pet starlings,"My 13 year old starling eats this, supplemented with healthy meat-based treats. He's healthy, happy, and there's little waste. And best of all, it's available on Amazon!"
1,Un-deserving,This film made me realize how Philadelphia fans dont deserve prefessional sports teams(Foles-got what u wished for-just theow something at him.....)
3,dislocated,"One very important aspect of this game that I missed was feeling the part. The pointer system is not my style. After playing Siberia 1 an 2 I felt I was that character, seeing the character as I moved it. If anyone can let me know of any games similar to siberia plese email me. Thanks![...]"
3,You get what you pay for,"The graphics were so dissappointing when I opened it, I closed it again and almost didn't play it. The puzzles were simple enough for even an inexperienced gamer, so I liked that part but totally lacked complexity and was more appropriate for a 9-year-old thatn an adult."
4,"Nicely done, except a few annoyances","My 9 year old got quite caught up in it, as did my spouse (who is an artist) as expert assistant. I, being tech support in the house, noticed the annoyances more: 1) wanted to be run as an Administrator, 2) crashed fairly often. The 1st was gotten around by determining what files needed access granted for Builtin\Users, exporting registry key for ""The Adventure Company"" (from Admin acct, then massaging to change HKU to HKCU, and importing from the intended acct). It then runs fine under a Limited User account. Not entirely sure about the cause of the 2nd annoyance, as it seemed to be fairly random..."
3,"Unique setting, decent execution","Kudos for the developer dedicating themselves to putting the player into the role of a prehistoric cave painter, and keeping it realisitc and entertaining at the same time..Obviously this game does play the myst school of gaming style, providing the usual item huntin, puzzle clicken blues, but whereas most games of this type seem generic in their mechanics, this game uses the same old mechanics in a different setting giving players a pretty unique experience..."
2,This game is going right back to J&R Music,"This game caused all kinds of havoc with my PC. Norton was constantly giving me low risk messages, and my PC ran Windows check disk on reboot. Never saw that before! I also had problems printing before I uninstalled this game."
2,Echo:-(,doesn't exactly grab your interest plus even with the cheat I am stuck something isn't working....
2,Boring.....,"This game was SO boring! The puzzles were stupid. The setting was interesting and could be a learning experience but the game itself was just SO bad and very short. Certainly not worth the money.If you like games such as Black Mirror, Myst, Atlantis etc you will be very disappointed with this game."
3,Interesting and fun but not for Klutzes,"I really enjoyed this game. The scenery is stunning. The characterizations were good to great. The puzzles were satisfying. Everything was fine until I got to a cave with a bear; a puzzle that must be solved with speed and reflexes - two things I do not possess, which is why I play adventure games rather than role-playing games. After about 200 unsuccessful attempts (over several days), I gave up. I was always a split-second too slow. I put the game aside with real regret. I can recommend this game without hesitation to anyone possessing just a tad of ""shoot-em-up"" skill."
2,"The Kids Are the Same, but still didn't care","After almost 3 years, Paul Collins' Beat had both their name and sound homogenized. They now had more in common with the likes of Eddie Money than their smart pop of the first album, and the similarity between ""The Kids Are The Same"" and Bryan Adams' ""The Kids Wanna Rock"" is kind of sad. Another case of corporate record company takes another promising band and blands them out before dismissing them....Sigh"
1,Superficial,"In looking through the discussions of rotary-wing aircraft, the author's clearly superficial understanding of the subject mitigates against taking this book seriously. This book is not authoritative and thus not usable as a reliable reference or springboard for further study."
3,The Unabashedly Simple Slow-Mo Flow,"""Lookin' At Me"" steps away from the Harlem representing emcee's uptempo party-rap sound - the dense, funky style. The number features Mase in complete slow-mo mode and showcases his flat, slow delivery that catapulted him to superstar status. The single is structured around a well chosen sample and razor sharp production by The Neptunes. ""Lookin' AT Me"" is focused around pedestrian rhymes at best and Mase's monotone can become rather wearying since he rarely changes cadences - features Puff Daddy who isn't exactly a preposessing rapper himself. The subject matter is simple - ""tough guys"" acting hard and the simple question asked by Mase, ""Now what the hell is you lookin' for?"" ""Lookin' At Me"" remains one of Mase's most successful singles - No. 1 Hot Rap Singles Chart, No. 8 Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks Chart and Top-40 Pop."
5,This cd is awesome!,I recommend this cd to any one even though it has a few swear words it's still one of my most recommended cd'sAlso with many guests like PUFF DADDY!
4,NEEDS TABLE OF CONTENTS,"This is an excellent reference for many unfamiliar words and phrases used in the English language, but an alphabetical table of contents or appendix would be helpful in locating them."
5,Liquid Silk,"Marina Raye's music touches my heart and assists me in moving to a state of peace and serenity. This CD, in particular, is very meditative. Oh, and did I mention beautiful? I am a massage practitioner and I frequently play this CD for my clients. My job is made much easier, because the music helps them to relax, let go and simply flow with their experience as they receive their massage.I own all of Marina Raye's CDs. I use them all when working. They are favorites with my clients. Liquid Silk tops the list."
4,Nature Surrounds Me,"Marina Raye's music is almost, or perhaps is, a religious experience. Her music can speak to the empty spaces within, filling them up with energy and peace. While Snow Falling On Silence is my favorite Marina Raye CD, Liquid Silk is the CD that first introduced me to Marina Raye and encouraged me to purchase more or her work. Definitely a worthwhile CD."
2,So So movie,I wasn't all that impressed by the movie in ANY aspect/ I'm not sure I'd even bother keeping it or seeing it again.
1,Endanger of a Lawsuit?,"Personally, I like the old New Line movie, ""The Hidden"". Sure, it's a little on the goofy side, but it's a guilty pleasure. There was a part of me that believed that, with all the remakes that are being done now, that it was only a matter of time before The Hidden would get remade at New Line. Probably with Ashton Kutcher as the alien. I was bracing myself for that news when I happened upon Endangered Species.Well, it looks like somebody beat New Line to the punch.I haven't seen anyone rip off a movie so directly since J.T. Petty tried to pass off his ""Rear Window inspired"" Mimic 3 as something original. ""Endangered Species"" marks a new career low for Eric Roberts and John Rhys- Davies. Do yourself a favor, skip over this one and buy yourself a copy of ""The Hidden"" instead."
4,"only a drop in the bucket, but that's about all we have","Korean listening comprehension is an extremely difficult task. There is a serious need for instruction materials in this area, and publishers are doing very little to meet this need.This volume 1 is easy to use, but it goes only a short way toward meeting the student's needs.Both volume 1 and 2 of this series seem to be out of print, and volume 2 seems to be unavailable anywhere.Meanwhile, the same publisher has published another listening course (1565912470) which is ten times too difficult. Why they have done that is known only to the publisher and God.One more word: Don't buy both this item and ""Korean Through Active Listening"" (1565910524 ). The two items differ only in title."
3,OK,"Stiff club, will take some practice. I still am not quite getting a consistently good pop off of them yet. But I think if you did a few 9hole practice rounds focusing on chipping, you'd have nice results with these wedges"
4,They do what they're meant to do,"The grips don't feel great, and the white trim on them falls off, but the clubs do exactly what they're meant to do very well.Shaved a few strokes off my game."
3,Bordering bland ballads,"As a jukebox disc, a smashing success. But there is just too much pop and not enough power in these progressive-lite diet plans."
1,Most boring album of the year,"I bought this record because I once admired JW's style and voice, so I was curious to find out what he does today. But sorry, Rock of Faith was wasted money. An album noone needs. Boring 3-chord-string-licks we heard many times before, meaningless sentimental lyrics in which he keeps repeating himself again and again. All in all, an album with no emotion, no love, no real lyrics. Just meaningless blah blah. Maybe Wetton cannot write good music without real good artists like Geoff Downes, Greg Lake, Robert Fripp, or Ken Hensley?"
5,This is music,"Without getting into particular tracks, this is music! These are songs. 'Songs' reflect a personal experience, or an observation that had an effect on you, or a big, direction-defining realization ... that's put into words, and music. Not music made with a computer [only] with a bunch of words thrown in that rhyme, with a repeating rhyme that gets called the ""chorus"" ... that happens like 30 times before it's over. Sad that most people under 28 no way would give this John Wetton CD a listen, today, all because it's by a guy who was in an '80s band. This man is what you call a SINGER. His voice is one of the top 10 best male singing voices on the planet. I happen to prefer this over the Asia stuff (with possible exception to the Astra record). His voice can be heard on the Asia Phoenix CD and on their Omega CD. This solo record came out a fair while ago, now, but it's a great listen ..... This is what music is supposed to be."
5,I can't believe Nissan sells this for $100,Incredibly fast shipping and the key fob worked on arrival after following the included instructions. I am ordering another one now for my wife!
4,Instructions you have to get online,"They key fob worked perfectly for my 04 frontier. As another said, program is a little odd, but pretty easy.It did not actually come with the instructions as stated, but instead I was sent an address of a website I could visit to get the instructions[...]. I gave it 4 stars because the seller was falsely advertising it as including instructions, when that is not completely accurate. Instead of the seller just printing the instruction to send to you as they advertised, they send a page long letter telling you not to leave them negative feedback, presumably for not including the instructions."
3,"OK, wraps up kind of fast.","I couldn't help but wonder if this book was written with some sort of deadline. The ending wraps up sort of quickly and neatly, but not how I expected so that was good."
4,Very Good. Insightful,"I am a lover of all things Irish. So when I picked up this book and saw it had to do with an Irish Immigrant I started reading. Houseguest deals mainly with the interactions of people on a personal level and how those interactions impact on one or both of the people. I was especially interested in Edward's reflection on caring for his wife & young daughter. How guilty he felt for wanting to scream/run away. I wouldn't want people to think all Immigrants wind up living with the upper class, rent free for months. Not likely. Very good novel. The references to Edna O'brien are correct."
2,wast of money,"the usbs never want to work or be recognized, it dose keep the lap top a little cooler."
2,Love is Space,Was not so impressed with this recording.It is a little out of character for what I waslooking for.
4,AN UNDISCOVERED TREASURE,"John Vanderslice originally came to me via a good friend. This CD has turned my good friend into my best friend. This album is stark yet gushes with emotion. It measures up well against Mr. Vanderslice's previous releases. Though the album is not a masterpiece, it is quite consistent. It receives four stars only so we may anticipate an even better release next time. Highly recommended tracks include: Cool Purple Mist, Me and My 424, Underneath the Leaves and Amitriptyline."
3,Where do they find them,"Where do they find these reviewers:""... William Blake, whose poetry on the pain of existence is used as a framing device."" Has this person ever read Blake? I hope Vanderslice has."
1,soundtrack to the life of a dork.,"self absorbed nerd rock is what i call it. no energy, no soul, no point. what does john vanderslice know about anything? boo-hoo. sorry guys, don't believe the hype."
1,Doesn't work on any door in our house! :(,"My son asked for this from Santa and got one. Unfortunately, we live in an older home, and it's impossible to line up the sensor and alarm on any of our doors. He was SO disappointed. We're giving this one away and buying the laser tripwire instead. Unless your doors are flush with the trim or close to it, don't buy this one!"
3,Not as good as expected,"I have been a Delbert McClinton fan for over 25 years. Having seen him live twice and if not mistaken I have all of his CD's and early cassettes. I love his various stlyes of music, especially the way he intrepets the lyrics.I thought the interviews on this DVD were great.My complaint is that I didn't like the sound mix for most of the musical performances. I thought I was having trouble with my surround sound system until I put in another music DVD. During the Clay McClinton interview his voice was so low it could barely be heard. It's like no one did a final quality control on the sound mix prior to releasing this DVD.I expected much better sound quality for this product."
4,classic cyberpunk,"Reading Metrophage was like re-discovering cyberpunk fiction all over again. He channels noir writers just like Gibson does in Neuromancer, but also drops in some sweet art history and quite respectable tech-extrapolations just like Sterling circa Holy Fire and street pomo theory, a la Zeitgeist."
3,"Good, but Neuromancer is far better","once again, a dystopic future where technology replaces morality, etc. etc. etc. It's a fun romp, a good read, but the Zen buddhist ending is VERY heavy handed, whereas Neuromancer's Zen buddhist ending is rather enlightening (just like a Zen buddhist ending should be!;)So should you rush out and overpay for a copy? Only if you like collecting books and/or are a cyberpunk completist.Should you read it? yeah, its pretty good."
1,Don't Bother,I found the whole book disjointed and difficult to follow. There was no real development of an characters just lurching from one disaster to another. Tne story seems to be unstructured and the ending is very disappointing.
3,music selection,"I first heard the piece ""visiting"" on the weather channel and immediately searched for it on I-tunes, when I couldn't find it there or anywhere else I decided to purchase the cd from Amazon. The other pieces on the cd are ok but the one I bought the cd for is only 2 minutes long."
5,Powerful & Beautiful music,"I never heard of this artist until I heard their music on the Weather Channel...I am a big fan of smooth jazz music and ""soundscapes"" and hearing the song ""Two Masters, One Muse"" made me feel as though I was one with nature. It is emotionally moving and empowering to listen to. I absolutely love this music and thankful that I was able to find it. Gooding is obviously an incredibly talented artist."
2,Not at all what I expected.,"While at the beginning I enjoyed what seemed to be a very different, manic, poetic take on Tokyo, I soon found myself skimming entire paragraphs and pages of non-sequitur. The author's descriptions are inaccurate at times and ludicrous at others. How exactly could FujiTV be ""under"" you as you travel the Rainbow Bridge? Hikarigaoka, desolate?And how is it that more half the description of Shibuya could be only about the pervasiveness of English in Tokyo? Avant-garde, yes, and I was thrilled to see someone invest such rich description in a book about the city I so love, but Mr. Barber's Tokyo is clearly very different from mine. Perhaps a more jaded expat than I would find it good reading rather than slowly infuriating, but hard to say.If you are looking for a travel book (as this seems to be erroneously labeled, both on its cover and in the section of the library where I happened across it), look elsewhere."
5,This is the best VCR that I could find....,"I am really bummed that they don't carry it, anymore!! The sylvania one is a piece of junk!!! I have two of the Quasar one and they are still working great, but I wanted to buy more; and now I can't find it."
1,Noisy operation,"This VCR is so loud -- Whenever I hit ""PLAY"", I have to practically double the TV volume in order to hear over the noise."
3,Nice Bag but disappointed,"After workout, I usually take a shower at the gym and then go to work, I was looking for a small bag to take to the Gym, I thought this one will be perfect, and actually it is the perfect size, but it would be better if there were compartments for wet or dirty clothes."
3,Wrong Size Listed,"Though it says ""Adidas Diablo Medium Duffel Bag,"" the reality is that its a SMALL duffel bag. Thats the only complaint I have. However, it is spacious enough to fit my two pairs of track shoes, towel, extra clothes, and water for my meets. For this reason I give this product a three instead of a two. Again, WRONG SIZE!"
5,The Perfect Gym Bag,"Not only is the price right, but this bag can hold alot of stuff! It is great for the gym. I really think it is a bit big for the gym but it depends on what you put in the bag. Being that I go to the gym after work, I bring enough clothes in it for a week and use a smaller bag to take to the gym. This bag is big enough to use as luggage also. I think it is a great bag for overnight stays too."
1,very bad,"se rompio muy rapido no resiste peso, esta hecho de un material muy malo no me gusto y se me daño, perdi mi dinero"
4,Pretty Good,This bag has been good. I'm looking for a new one at this point because I need one with extra compartments or side pouches. If you're looking for a basic bag for shoes and large things then this is perfect.
3,Just OK,"The bag didn't have any pockets which is a bummer because usually I have to carry things like my keys, wallet, headphones, ect. All my stuff is sort of jumbled inside one big bag but its good for the price. I can tell its not going to last me very long. The material seems thin and the zipper is a little cheap feeling however if you just need a bag to go to the gym a few times a week this one will do. If you are looking to use this bag 5 or 6 days a week all the time, I would go with a different one."
3,A good workout bag,"Even though this bag is marketed as a small duffel, it's still pretty large. I'm 5'4 with an average frame, and it's basically the size of my torso. I'm okay with the size, but if you're looking for a smaller duffel, you may want to try something else.I like that it has a hard plastic on the bottom inside so the bag retains its shape. The shoulder strap is super convenient. My only gripe is that it has no pockets. None inside, none outside...nothing. A small pocket to place my phone and gym lock would be nice, but for the price I paid I can't be too upset."
3,Spacious but not many compartments,"I liked that the bag was spacious, I was able to fit my shoes and clothing in the bag and it was a cute compact size but it does not have compartments so sometimes I'd have to put my phone or jewelry in there and it would get lost in the bag when I needed it since there were no extra pockets. If extra pockets are not needed by you, than this is a good bag to purchase."
5,Nice size,I was looking for a smaller gym bag...and I have found it. It's the perfect size for just a few things.
2,Not in the same league as Tarika's other albums,"This is the weakest of Tarika's albums. The songs discuss deep issues, from the systemic corruption of Madagascar's politicians to France's 1947 use of soldiers from its other African colonies to brutally put down a Madagascar uprising. But all the effort was put into the lyrics, and none into the music. Unless you speak Malagasy, once you've read through the liner notes, what you're left with is a CD of nondescript music. The song ""Avelo"" is an exception. (I'm not even sure the effort was put into the lyrics--Hanitra Rasoanaivo's liner notes are a lot more compelling than the translations of the lyrics she provides.)"
3,Only for those who must have everything Ms. Syms recorded.,"I first became awared of Sylvia Syms back in the late 1960's, and found her husky singing quite seductive. I have close to a dozen of her LP's, and quite a few of her CD's. This album was recorded toward the end of Ms. Syms' career; and, sad to say, the lustre of her earlier recordings is no longer apparent. Listening to her as she valiantly struggles from one song to the next is almost painful. As fond as I am of Sylvia Syms, I cannot honestly recommend this album to any but the most die-hard of her fans."
3,an average motocross game,"The gameplay is okay, the graphics are good, and the LAN racing is okay. But the music will annoy the piss out of you. Same with the announcers."
4,Very Entertaining,"I was totally enthralled by this DVD because I had never heard of this band and the whole time I was watching it I was thinking to myself that this is a mock-documentary and a genius one at that. Then it dawned on me that no one could have made this up even though the lead singer, I think his name was Rad, seemed to be sent from central casting to play the part of a sort of idiot savant, misunderstood genius, anti-hero, Peter Pan pop singer.What I liked about this documentary is that they kept going back to the band performing songs. Which are hard to tell whether they are joke or genius.We are still trying to figure out if ""Half Japonese"" is an urban myth.The talking heads in this movie, expressing their bitterness over the fact that this band never made it big are also from central casting and really add the spice to this film."
2,a waste,This is a documentary about crazy people-not Half Japanese. Most of the so-called critics can't remember a damned thing except for how great they are for recognizing the greatness of Jad while continuously ranting about their major-label conspiracy theories. Penn Jillette even goes so far as to brag about how he conned a homeless person out of Jad's material and then threatened Jad with physical violence if he ever talked to the guy. If you're interested in mental illness and sleazy people like Penn Jillette stroking themselves then by all means watch this. If you're interested in a great American rock band then just buy the albums and listen.
4,Indie rock heaven - - showing the kids how it is done!,"This is a wonderful picture about some of indie rock's most eccentric stars. The live rooftop performance of ""1,000,000 kisses"" is worth the price of admission alone. And Jay Fair's explanation of ""How to play guitar"" may cause you to wet yourself with delight. Have napkins close for the tears of laughter and joy. If you like indie rock check this out. My only complaint is all of the major label bashing. It is rather pointless in this context. There is also some blow hard DJ type who disses the Beatles (! ). As does someone who negatively reviewed this DVD, but he appears to hate almost everything except the J Geils Band's (?) first album. Bwahahahahahahaha! BUY BUY BUY!"
4,For Indie Rock fans,"This is a very cute and amusing documentary on ""Half Japanese"". It seems really relavent to the rock music scene here in the U.S. in which "" ... rock"" groups like Korn and Limp Bizkit are the big sellers. If you're a big indie rock fan (like me) then this will definately tickle your fancy and give you hope that someone out there is in their garage making another breakthrough album."
2,Lost Opportunity,"This film is weirdly obsessed with why the band isn't as popular as mainstream music. It spends most of the film railing against the music industry rather than the band itself. The band exists in contrast to mainstream music. It parodies and plays off of it. The filmmaker is so far off the mark in making this film that it is really depressing. Lovely interview with Penn Gillette, and that's the best part of the film. Nice interviews with the guys but all too short. ALL of the stuff about the ""industry"" is a waste of time and a damn shame...and totally misses the point."
3,this book is topo brief only 30 pages shud be 60,"this book is a brief outline of amish life from childs perspectiivenot enough material,.the author should ad d more contecnt"
4,Slightly underwhelming,"This re-recording is spectacular enough, but somehow too neat and polished to fit the spirit of the music. The original soundtrack in all its savage beauty is still essential, but this makes a fine supplement."
3,Koyaanisqatsi,"Three observations:1) The opening chrch organ and sepulcheral voice send chills down my spine. I had never heard anything like it before. Gregorian chant with this creepy organ - totally awesome.2) I don't like it when Glass does that repetitive ""123432"" keyboard deal. Granted he does it all the time, and some people think that that is the whole point of the music, but I still don't like it. That's why I only give it three stars.3) The one with the choir is TOTALLY COOL."
2,Repetition...repetition...repetition...repetition...rep...,"Has an echoic, cosmic sensibility but nonetheless a big disappointment. Glass's musical well runs dry within a few measures in each track, resulting in a monotonous and depressing musical purgatory. Take away the repetition...the repetition...the repetition... the... and this would be a very short CD indeed. However, I recognize that some people like to hear the same three or four measures played ad infinitum. If you are one of these, then buy this work."
5,Deeply spiritual meditation on the crazy pace of modern life,"The Native American chant which introduces the score is so evocative! Hard to listen to this music without seeing Reggio's stunning visions pop into mind. What a fabulous, little-known film it was, and this music is the perfect score for it."
5,Reminiscent of Live Performance,"I once saw Koyaanisqatsi with Phillip Glass performing live at UCLA Royce Hall in 1987. The re-recording of the original score is very reminiscent of the performance Glass gave that night. Even if you have the new re-release of the complete sound track, this album is worth having in either the CD or DVD-A formats."
5,Very Good Minimalism,"I like some of Philip Glass' music only for what it is: minimalism, although minimalism is not of the same caliber as many of the older periods.Open-mindedness does not mean accepting everything that comes before you as equally valid, it is only the willingness to give someone or something fair consideration. Then one must make distinctions and judgements.I really like this CD; it is very meditative and deep (thanks to the minor keys which predominate this CD). But it is also very repetitive, sometimes tedious (as is this genre).The minimalists are just doing something different (and easier?), pushing the limits of what classical music is, which draws attention to them."
2,Criminal Abridgement,"This is NOT the soundtrack. This is the music chopped up into a bunch of tracks. If you've seen the movie, wait until these cheapskates put it out. I saw a DVD Audio disc in the store today. I couldn't tell if that was the complete score.This piece is one of the great compositions of the last 25 years. In this form, some of the best aspects of the score are just gone. About halfway through the movie, there's a dark, incredibly beautiful dirge tapped out on the synth with a plodding beat behind it that is my favorite section of the whole piece. If the movie ever makes it to DVD we can all get it the way it should be heard. Incredible that it's still not available in its entirety."
4,Very good multichannel DVD Audio,"I wasn't sure what to expect after reading some of the more critical reviews. Being a fan of the movie and the soundtrack, as well as being intrigued with the idea of a high quality multichannel DVD Audio version, I decided to give it a try.Like some have said, this performance is different than the original, but I still enjoyed it very much. It's also nice having the music that was missing from the original CD release. The sound quality is great and the surround mix adds to the enjoyment of the performance without being gimmicky.I would recommend this to fans who have a system capable of taking advantage of the multichannel sound."
3,somewhat disappointing,"With the benefit of hindsight it is easy to see Koyaanisqatsi as a watershed between the old Phillip Glass and the new one. The old Glass,of course, practiced a kind of fundamentalist Minimalism: hard, monotonous, often excruciating, but also exciting and agressive. The new Glass, starting with Satyagraha, became ever more mellow, ever more classical. To me the 1983 recording of koyaanisqatsi seemed to represent the best of both worlds: the hard-edged agressiveness of the old Glass and the greater sophistication and complexity of the new one.I cannot see this new recording as an improvement. We seem to have lost the rough edges, the almost metallic sound that made the old recording so exciting. At times, but for very different reasons, Glass is almost boring again."
3,"All the music, half the energy","It's nice to have a recording of the complete Koyaanisqatsi music. This was one of the last of Glass's really good compositions, IMO, and the scoring of ensemble and voices is astonishing. The music gets 4 and 1/2 stars.But compared to the performance of the film and issued on the first recording, the new performance is dull and stuffy, like it's trying to cater to the PBS crowd. Glass is at his best when he's a little bit scary and unsettling, and this performance, which rates about 2 stars at best, is about as scary and unsettling as a Merchant-Ivory film.Combined rating: 3 stars. Perhaps someday they'll put out the actual film soundtrack"
3,Different but not exactly better than the original,"I've grown used to the truncated version of these tracks on the original CD and these newer renditions seem less punchy and more tentative. Technically well done, but more bland, as if they were trying too hard to avoid mistakes.For example, ""Cloudscape"" has a more distant sound, and ""Prophecies"" has a reedier organ/synthesizer tone that lacks the ancient, haunting quality of the original. The differences aren't subtle.While I was writing this review I learned that ""Koyaanisqatsi (Complete Original Soundtrack Version)"" adds a lot of material missing from the original CD, plus it's not a re-recorded version. If I could only have one CD from this film, it would be that one."
3,Very disappointed...,"I was very disappointed when i began watching these videos b/c the cover says ""parental advisory explicit content"" but the videos are edited. EDITED?!!! Why in the world would an ICP video ever need to be edited anyway? It's so-pose to be underground and wicked, not edited for the masses. What are you doing here Psychopathic Records?!!!"
4,DVD,"This DVD is jam packed with Psycopathic recording artists' music vidsand is hosted by some JCW wrestlers' also ICP and other Psychopathicartists' this dvd is a must have for the fans.If you don't already own this, you don't know what your missing out on.Grab a copy ASAP. This DVD is for the juggalos and jugglettes, clown luvWhoop!,Whoop!"
5,Fine....just fine,"I personally hate red beans but I bought them to make for my boyfriend's birthday. He seemed to enjoy them well enough and the simple recipe on the bag was what I used. All in all, a perfectly fine affordable red bean."
1,Nowhere near the Oxford Press Concise,You will regret buying this when you see everyone else in China using the Oxford Press/Shangwu Yinshuguan Concise Chinese-English English-Chinese Dictionary. That dictionary has a much larger vocabulary and better indexes. Search Amazon again under Oxford's editor A.P. Cowie.
1,No competition for the Oxford Concise,"Tuttle produces some good books, but this one falls far short of A.P. Cowie's Oxford Concise Chinese-English English-Chinese Dictionary which is also available through Amazon."
5,super book for the model maker,This book was bought solely to be used as a reference source for my model making hobby. Well laid out and excellent photographs make this a must for the model fanatic. Living in England there is not a great deal of decent reference material of this nature. So it was a pleasant suprise to be able to order this book on line and receive it within days and at an excellent price. I really cannot reccomend this book enough.
5,Zanker on Pompeii,"This book is with out a doubt an wonderful souce for students and Pompeii fanatics. As a classist myself, I was enraptured by this book. Zanker is able to intergrate the archaeological evidence with a comperhensive look at the pompeian socity. This is not to be missed!!"
3,If you need a loveseat,"Assembling this is easy, but time consuming. The wood is unfinished, but unlike cheaper futon frames, it's at least sanded smooth. If you need a love seat option for a futon, it's OK, but it's still a futon frame, with no arms."
3,very nice but ...,I love this frame as I have acid reflux syndrome and can not sleep on a flat bed. The only and rather notable issue is that the elevation notches are a bit too high so its like it has 3 propped up for reading levels and then to flat. I really needed a lifted rest position that is in-between sleep and sitting. So we are experimenting with various leg raisers. Also if you set it up with lifters the middle leg moves so it has to be braced. I'm still grateful for it as there are very few inexpensive solutions for people who can not sleep flat. Also I have not had any problems with hard spots but we did go out for a better than typical futon mattress.
4,Serves it's purpose,Nice for a spare bedroom. I do like the different positions you can set up the futon. A good buy.
5,My husband and I love it so far,"We have had this for about a month now, we bought a 10"" futon mattress for it which doesn't really allow us to fold it so we can put the lounger part under the seat but that isn't the futon's fault, just warning if you want to do that get a thinner mattress. We use this all day long as a couch and as a bed at night. It embarrasses me to admit that we are not small people, not even close, and I was really worried about our weight possibly breaking this but it has proven itself very strong.I love the extra room we have when the back is folded up, it is easy for me alone to move it so I can clean underneath unlike our bed which I could never get clean well without uprooting the whole thing and having to assemble it back. This is my first futon and I can say without a doubt that I don't think I will ever go back to having an expensive, heavy, cheaply made bed. I would very much rather have this futon."
2,Just Ok.,"The frame was rather flimsy, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone over about 150 pounds. There was a lot of assembly - each and every one of those sticks you see is a separate piece for you to put together. Two of the pieces that came with it were the wrong length. Finally, it wouldn't adjust to a comfortable angle. The picture you see here is as far as it will recline unless you tip it all the way down to flat."
3,Great if you don't need to move it frequently,"It's sturdy and works well as a bed or a chair. But I bought a futon so I could convert it daily from bed to chair. When I pull up the back to fold it into a chair the front legs always collapse. This is a bit of a pain. It also allows the mattress to slide down (if moved bed/chair/bed/chair) and that makes it tiresome. So, if ya don't plan on a frequent conversion it's great."
2,Not worthy of a book,"I was a bit surprised to see all the favorable 5-star reviews for this book. I suppose if you're really new to ideas about health such as drinking lots of water and cutting out refined carbohydrates, this may make a very basic introduction. There's something nice about keeping things simple. This book really contains about the same amount of information as an article in a health magazine, the rest being padding and filler. ALL of these ideas I have seen many times elsewhere, there's nothing new here. As a matter of fact, if you want to know what this book is about, skip everything up to page 171, where he summarizes the entire 12 steps in 3 pages. I got this book at the library, I'm sure glad I didn't buy it. It's just not worthy of an entire book."
3,So-so; he's done better.,"Bought this cd based on owning The Parish Notices (very good). The first 3 songs get this cd off to a solid start, but then things take a turn to a very quiet folk sound. Good lyrics but not much to get your toes tapping. I'd recommend The Parish Notices for more of a pop/folk experience."
1,don't believe what you see,"As you see from the picture, these are supposed to be earbuds. When you get them you will find out they are not. I informed them that they have pictures inverted with the in-ear lanyard, but they don't care, and didn't fix it. I've had three of them now, and they are all the wrong ones, and had to be returned. The original product, which is the right picture, is the best thing since sliced bread. It allows you to hang your Ipod around your neck, and when you can listen, you just put in the earbud. No long cords to get caught on everything and yank them out of your ear. The lanyard without the bud hurts your ears, but the ear-bud is comfortable. they are very fragile, I've had about 15 pair, and they have all broken, but it's worth it because I love them. Everytime I have them around my neck, I get comments from people about how great they are, but you can't find them anymore, Apple disconinued them, probably because they are so fragile."
1,Don't get these!,"When I got the Apple iPod Lanyard the earpieces hurt my ears and wouldn't stay in until I bought the Griffin Technology 4039-EJAM EarJam Earbud Sound Enhancing Covers. The combination worked beautifully: they stayed in my ears comfortably and the sound quality was great.When I saw these, I thought they'd be perfect and I'd be able to abadon my Griffin Earjam Earbuds. I was wrong. The sound quality is horrible (significantly lower volume) and they refuse to stay in my ears! Will be selling them."
1,Earplugs fall out,"The absolutely worst headphones I have ever had. Trying the different sizes, the earplugs just don't want to stay in my ears (even standing still). The headphones that come with the I-Pod, and the earlier version of lanyard headphones were both much better. The sound was fine, but not any better than the standard headphones. A poor product. I was very disappointed, as I have had good experiences in general with Apple in the past."
2,Great for a Costume party,"Good sound, but makes you look like a 22nd century rapper wearing this thing."
2,you get what you pay for....,"i was so excited when i found these lanyard headphones had been marked down from $50 to 14.77...then i found out why..no matter what size ear cover you use they just don't stay in your ear!! i still like the idea of the ipod hanging around your neck, but i think i am going back to my original ear buds and might try a arm band...these were really disappointing ;-("
1,Could be better,"The sound is really great, but there is one problem with this headphones they keep falling from my ears no matter what rubber caps (they come with 3 different sizes) I used. The design flaw makes them unusable for me."
1,"Looks good, Doesn't work","I honestly can't tell if these are truly Apple earphones. They look like they are, but the packaging was distinctly not Apple, and since only one earphone works on each set (I bought two sets) they certainly did not make it through Apple product testing. If I had to guess I would guess that they failed Apple testing at the factory (Guandong Provence) and were sold out the back door to some enterprising wholesaler who then sold them to some retailer who then sold them to me. Whatever, they are junk, unless, of course, you are already deaf in one ear."
2,All plugged up,"Even coming with three sizes of of ""ear gasket"", using the smallest I'm afraid these headpohones still don't fit comfortably, and the 'seal' it creates on the ear is terrible. If you work out and sweat, it becomes even more atrocious, and as you adjust the headphones, the gaskets slip out of place; they're keyed to the headphone, but they don't stay in place. I am fairly dissatisfied with these In Ear headphones, and would not recommend them to anyone."
3,Not real good...,"I bought these a couple months ago and I noticed that I can't use these in PE.(our pe teacher lets us listen to our iPods when we run the mile) when I jumped or ran, my iPod jumped right off the lanyard and sat in our rocky track waiting to get crushed. It doesn't stay on well."
4,he said/she said,"this is not one of carol shields best efforts. however,it is immensely readable.the story of a marriage from two points of view is a triumph.it would make an excellent movie."
2,bummer,Happenstance was the selected book for our book club...first it took a couple of weeks to get it from Amazon then I had to power thru it. Cool concept of having a man's version and flip it over and you get the woman's version but you are kept waiting...and waiting...andWouldn't recommend this book.
3,"A HE-SAID,SHE-SAID NOVEL ABOUT MARRIAGE","A husband,a wife,a marriage...two stories. The first book reveals the wife's goings on and her marital reflections. The second book ditto for the husband.All in the same time frame. Not one of Carol Shields best efforts. Kind of unmemorable. The same dissatisfaction I felt from reading The Box Garden."
5,Rare soundtrack,I had been searching for a copy of the beautiful soundtrack from The Vikings for several years.The copy came quickly and despite being used is perfect.The music from Solomon and Sheba is a nice bonus.
4,"Excellent, researched and spell-binding","Jay Weidner has produced an excellent documentary, with high-quality visuals and a compelling flow that will keep you interested until the last minute. At the end of the DVD, I found myself thirsting for more. The only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is because the visuals displayed a tendency towards redundancy.""Secrets of Alchemy"" explores the underlying ""mystical"" meaning of alchemy, as opposed to the commonly-held ""literal"" view of its purpose. Although the documentary leans towards interpreting the symbols on the ""Cross of Hendaye,"" I felt as if Weidner was really trying to communicate profound mystical concepts inherent in an understanding of alchemy.Well thought out with excellent story-telling, this DVD will not disappoint anyone on the road to enlightenment and meaning in a world seemingly devoid of both."
5,The cross,"This was really an interesting DVD depending on how much you know in regarding history, it touches on events in prerecorded history that are very controversial."
2,Entertaining - but I think that's it,"I think this documentary was entertaining. But if you are in the pursuit of divine truth, I think this is not what will provide it. I may be wrong, though."
3,Secrets of Alchemy- The Great Cross and he End of Time,The customer service was very nice. The item is good.
4,WALTZES WITH THE OCCASIONAL UP-TEMPO NUMBER,"Chick Henderson was an extremely popular singer whose career was ended tragically in 1942 by a piece of shrapnel. He sang with various bands, the best-known being that of Joe Loss, with which he recorded from late 1935 to early 1942. This compilation is comprised mainly of songs in waltz tempo, with only the occasional up-tempo number like ""I Double Dare You"" to leaven the mix.That is a minor cavil though, which should not deter you from purchase."
4,Collection of tid-bits and proven advice from over 50 years,"This collection of tid-bits and proven advice from over 50 years of Organic Gardening magazine has bushels of know-how crammed into an easy to read format. If you love the magazine, you'll love the book. The instructions for being an organic gardener are put forth here in plain English so that anyone can grow a great garden without the use of chemicals!"
4,Practical easy to understand organic gardening advice.,"This book has a wealth of tid-bits. Many brief articles with advice and instruction in a practical, easy to understand format."
5,The tale of a mouse with inner strength.,"This children's book is a retelling of a Great Plains Indian tale about a mouse who travels far to see a beautiful land and how, despite misfortune, through his courage, strength , and selflessness, he is successful. The book was a 1985 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustrations in a book for children."
5,Heartwarming book of sacrifice and adventure,I read this book for my children's literature course and it is one of my favorites. Jumping Mouse is an adventurous mouse full of compassion for others and confidence in his journey. I would say it is a book of sacrifice and adventure. The black and white illustrations are incredibly detailed-nature lovers will love them.
4,Wickedly devious,"I ordered the Omnibus intending to surprise my 8 year old daughter who has some of his famous children's books. When I picked it up at the store, I was surprised to learn that some of the stories had appeared in The New Yorker, and ... The Playboy! These are undoubtedly adult versions of his children's stories, with the same wickedly devious mind behind them. If, an 8 year old Charlie concocts a bitter medicine with household chemicals for his nagging grandmother, one can guess what he would do with highly potent bee protein as an adult bee keeper. You certainly need a wicked sense of humour to enjoy these stories but not since Damon Runyon's On Broadway was I so captivated by the short story. Recommended reading but certainly not for children!"
5,Wonderful Training Guide,"This is a wonderfully useful book - teach your child the simple day-to-day skills - things you take for granted that they actually have to learn! Skills include doing up buttons, pouring, sorting, putting on a coat, doing up shoe laces, etc. It is super easy to follow, and has further steps once your child has mastered the basic skill. Chapters include Life Skills, Developng the Senses, Language Development, Numeracy Skills, Science Skills. A great opportunity to quietly teach your child to become confident with every day skills."
5,Great Montessori book,"It is great but more for kids under 3 years old, mine is almost five so can not get the best of it for my daughter but as I said great for any under 3."
4,Excellent for Montessori at home!,"This is a wonderful book for parents wanting to do basic Montessori activities at home, and it also suggests inexpensive ways to make activities as well. I gave this book one less star because it doesn't tell you what activities are age appropriate. I know all children develop and excel in different ways and times, but a little more guidance would have been helpful."
4,Please mark the appropriate age range for this book in your description.,"The very first line of this book indicates that the activities it includes are perfect for a 3 - 5 year old child. Having thumbed through it, it is chock full of great, simple activities that are indeed perfect for a child of this age range. Unfortunately, nothing in the description of this book indicated that this was the case, and I've just purchased it to use with my 2 year old child. While I'm certain I will be able to use the book in the future for many hours of educational enjoyment and discovery, I am disappointed that the description did not make clear that this book would have little to offer at the present time."
1,BOO,"Had nothing to do with booties. Wasn't worth purchasing. Though the art work was pretty good, well composed and drawn."
5,Be Creative,"Use this Book for work, day care, School, and more. Show your creativity, impress everyone with your holiday spirit. This book is paired perfectly with Valentine School Parties."
5,Fantastic Smoky Flavor,"Tapatio salsa picante is one of my favorite hot sauces. The flavor is more smoky and complex than Tabasco and other popular hot sauces. Although it goes perfectly with almost any kind Mexican or Southwestern food, it's also a great compliment to a variety of other dishes, including spaghetti and soups. In addition, the sodium content is relatively low - 110mg per teaspoon (many comparable brands have 200-250mg), making it an excellent, low-sodium way to add flavor to your food. Most highly recommended."
5,Just a comment,"Since my divorce, I have read several book about it. This one is as good as the others in its content, but with a plus. It includes statements from others that have been where you are and include questionnaires at the end of each building block to check in you have grasped the concept. A great book to work through after a divorce."
5,This is a must have,This book will help you through your grieving process. You will be glad you purchased this book. It tells you so many things you would not have thought about.
2,disappointing,"A friend who lost her husband was helped quite a lot by this book, so I can't be too critical here. And judging by many rave reviews it has helped folks. However, I found very little unique material. If you've read a number of ""self-help"" books such as works by Pema Chodron, Eckhart Tolle, S. Levine, you know what deep, moving and inspiring books are like. This seemed too obvious, comprised of near-platitudes. I hope that anyone who is grieving and looking for help might do a little more research, or maybe just get this one from the library before buying."
1,Poor Quality,The posters are very flimsy. Thinner than regular school lined notebook paper. Not a good buy.
2,Better Live,"I have had many opportunites to see Brandon Giles sing on Sunday nights at the Bluegrass Inn. This cd lacks the electricity associated with his live shows. I have an earlier cd that is better. Brandon, I know you have your mojo working and you are much better than this cd. By the way, whatever happened to that cute blond girl that used to pass the tip jar around?"
4,Melissa Joan Hart in Satin,"I'm a huge Melissa Joan Hart fan. In this movie she plays Lauren Wells, a small town bartender and waitress. Her character is sweet, vulnerable and strong. She plays a girl feeling a little stuck and looking for more out of life. When Jack Satin, a Vegas lounge singer arrives, though he's full of himself, he sparks her interest. She's not into him right away, but as they spend time together she sees underneath his showy act there is a man she just might love. Though sweet and funny, this role is also dramatic and a welcomed departure for Melissa. I hope she takes on more roles like this. The movie left me with that warm and fuzzy feelling. Only thing I wish is that there was more of her, but the title is Satin and it is the lounge singer's story, so maybe if we are lucky there will be a Satin 2 and it will kick off with Jack Satin and Melissa right away. Oh, and she looks beautiful in this."
4,"Another Great Roger the Chapman book, but (4-1/2 stars)","I love Roger. And as a teacher I've told writing students often that they need to foreshadow. Kate Sedley sometimes over foreshadows. She gives clues out at the beginning of this book that I wished I didn't have. Although I love Roger and his world, and the charactes he encounters here, and there are many surprises,I kept wishing Roger would get on with it and figure out this one clue.But then Roger is always interesting. This just isn't one of the very best in the series but is well worth reading.(For those who don't know the series, this is a series that is best read in order.)"
1,Disaster,Received wrong book. Notified company as per their directions. Received no answer or correct book. Worst experience I have had purchasing a book yet.
4,Print too small,"The Ignatius Bible studies are great resources. The print, however, is unacceptably small. If you have even minor eye issues, you need magnification to use these study guides. This is a real drawback to an excellent series of commentaries."
2,With a due respect it did not move me,"Seawind's lastest album cannot remotely compare to their first and second albums, with emphasis on the one with ""Follow your Road."" The second album was a spiritual-secular bombshell. Maybe it is too much to ask for that same kind of album now. I will admit, it is nice to here the sweet soulful voice of the lead singer. Please put the Follow your Road album on CD. It will make an impressive present for a host of my friends. Peace and Self-reflection."
2,Does not compare with their first and second albums,"Please re-release their first two albums on CD, especially the one with ""Follow Your Road"" on it.If I remember correctly this album was calledSeawind/Seawind. It had a tropical style cover."
3,Just Before Dawn,"My daughter was sexually abused from the ages of three to five years old. This book was recommended by her therapist--who it is obviously written for. I felt it was written on a technical level, and not a personal level. It may be appropriate for some. However, if you are looking for help on how to cope with this horrible situation, or to at least hear from someone who has been there...this book doesn't give any comfort. It seems to be targeted for therapist, not those that are trying to deal with a horrible situation and are deperate for help."
2,Brigit Jones goes Backpacking,"I've hiked a few of the Great Hikes and when I found this book I was very excited. Sad to say, this book reveals more about the pretentious, condescending, obsessed with minutiae author than interesting facts about New Zealand. Her poor, high-school level prose is rivaled only by her abilities to overgeneralize and self-aggrandize. That may sound harsh, but reading this book is like watching ""The Office""--and if you think Ricky Gervais was awkward, then this book will be a real treat. I can't recommend this to anyone unless they happen to love both tramping and whiny, awkward Brits."
5,Best Marketing Book Ever!!,This book is a must for any business major. I learn the in and outs of business just in this book and many other books are outdated material. This book will not put you to sleep. It focus on the basic concepts of each chapter. I would highly recommend to any college students or business persons.
4,"Buy it for the Cello Concerto, forget the rest","The Elgar Cello Concerto is performed wonderfully here--just magic. The legendary team of Barenboim and Du Pre plus her famous way with this piece are known to all classical music lovers.Barenboim alone as a conductor is another matter. I've never cared for his willful, sometimes even goofy performances, and the other Elgar pieces he conducts on this disc show him to be at his irritating worst. If you want to hear inspired, noble performances of the Pomp & Circumstance Marches and the Enigma Variations buy Adrian Boult's versions with the London Symphony and London Philharmonic Orchestras on EMI/Seraphim."
4,Gorgeous,"Of course this is a gorgeous piece, and she is the best. BUT, putting two versions of pomp and circumstance before the concerto is SO irritating. the moods are totally different and they are no preparation for the concerto. Why can't they just make CD's with what you want on them instead of filling them up with things you don't want?"
4,Good recordings,"This is a good cd of the music chosen. I know the cello concerto is supposed to be significant, but I have trouble getting into it. The Enigma Variations are good, but perhaps not the best version I have heard.. Still ... this is a very good cd."
1,What was I thinking?,"This thing looks like a torture device or some type of a naughty marital toy. The hammock part is overly complicated and simply does not offer the support that one would expect for an item of this nature. The tripod frame is incredibly big and after a quick inspection, appeared to be well made. Unfortunately, I soon found out that it was unable to handle a 175 lb adult. Please take a look at my picture on the product page."
2,Just finished the nuclear boards,"I am a cardiology fellow and have completed my nuclear cardiology rotations and have recently taken the nuclear cardiology boards. I would not recommend this book for a fellow studying nuclear cardiology and especially not for someone who is preparing for the cardiology nuclear boards.The book did some things quite well such as illustrations, tables, and tips on reading nuclear images. However, other books provide similar information. The biggest issue is that the book does not cover much of what I was asked about as a fellow and it did not cover multiple critical topics for the boards. For example there is no section on radiotracers and their properties to name one of many topics left out of this book.I thought that the textbook by Iskandrian was much more helpful for the clinical side of the test and the book by Chandra was extremely helpful for the physics."
2,"Deep, but full of arrogance","Adi Da is definately a deep spiritual teacher. I love to learn from. This book has a lot of meaning of being, even just holding the book. Reading it is quite the opposite. The arrogance says a lot. When a teacher of this caliber makes it all about him with no humility, I pass.I would suggest some of his DVD or The knee of listening instesd."
1,A new low for MS Press,"This ""book"" is like a rough draft of a sales brochure. It appears to be mainly a sales promo aimed at VB6 programmers. It is a very brief overview that is filled with errors. The code download and errata are not available on the given site. The code in the book is mere snippets that constantly refer the reader to the nonexistent code download. Net framework 2.0 is frequently referred to as version 1.2 making it difficult to know if they meant version 1.1 or 2.0. It is not possible to run any code with the snippets they provide. The book has little value except as an error filled sales brochure for nonprogrammers. The authors and MS Press should be ashamed to put out garbage like this book."
1,Very light introduction,This book did not teach me very much more than articles that I read on MSDN or what I learned by myself using VB 2005 beta. One interest that I had was the new partial classes concept and the book does not talk about it. It mainly describes the new bells and whistles of VB 2005. It is only a brief introduction of VB 2005.
3,Introducing Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 for Developers,"Interesting book, but somewhat superficial.But gives goodexamples of the new language enhancements."
1,"This was not the correct version of ""Alexander the Great"" I ordered (extremely displeased)","I specifically ordered Classic Hollywood Studios' album for Barabba/Alexander the Great. I ordered that version specifically because it contained 11 tracks from the ""Alexander the Great"" soundtrack. When I ordered the item, the picture of the product even showed Classic Hollywood Studio's CD album (made in 1996). I was very precise when I ordered this product.Instead, I got a 1989 CD album made by Legend CD5 which also contains the soundtracks for Barabba/Alexander the Great. However, Legend CD5's CD only has 8 tracks from the ""Alexander the Great"" soundtrack.This is not the product I paid for. The album covers for Legend CD5 vs Classic Hollywood Studios are radically different."
4,Good costum for the price,It is a cheap costume but looks good for what you pay for it. It is what I expected and arrived quickly. I am happy with it and would order again from this company.
5,New Beatle Stories,"For any Beatles fan one can instantly connect with Seth Swirsky's 'Beatles Stories', a definite must have.Henry Winkler's wife hovering meeting P. McC, Susanna Hoffs', 'Ringo, you're the greatest drummer in the world' (I agree), The Fonz, on top of the world at the time, when met by a Beatle, even Monarchs must obey.What a great idea this movie is, brilliant quotes throughout: Steve Kipner's 'how can Ringo live anywhere?', with many an emotional moment, especially for a musician, imagine playing one of George Harrison's guitars. You find out that Norman Smith did a huge song in the 70's 'Oh Babe, what would you say?'.I'd say I love it. Thank you, Seth, for bringing to life many true Beatle stories and helping to write them into rock and roll history that would have otherwise someday been lost forever.Watched it 5 times already.Rock on,Duncan Faure"
4,Great for the Beatles Fan,Really enjoyed all the stories. Very well put together. It should be in every Beatles fan's collection as it offers unique perspectives on the group and each individual member. Not a boring minute in this DVD and the extras are good as well.
5,Don't miss this movie!,I really enjoyed this movie so much. I'm a real Beatles fan and it was so cool hearing these true untold stories. I've seen almost all of the films on The Beatles and this is one of a kind. Nothing out there like it. It's really fun and enjoyable.
5,Seth Hits a Homerun,"Seth, I am in heaven at the moment. A great Beatles fan. I own everything they produced, music wise I think, and just watched your Documentary, Beatles Stories, and Wow. What a great job you did. I will be watching this many times over. You have to be proud of this film and to you Sir I say Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Have a great day.If you don't like this documentary then you don't like music, history or the BeaTles. This was not about the BeaTles and their music, but about the BeaTles from other folks point of few having met, worked with and just known them. Who would have guessed Georges first girlfriend and first kiss.? This will go into my collection with all of my other Beatles music and history. Seth Great job."
5,Beatles Stories,"Thanks for sending this DVD so quickly and in such great condition. The stories on this DVD were fantastic to hear and see. Also, thanks for having it at a great price."
5,I never knew that...,"I am an avid Beatles fan and know a lot of their history, but, this DVD was so informative and entertaining, that I learned much and enjoyed watching the DVD. This DVD will be enjoyable and informative for any Beatle's fan!"
1,Quite Unbiblical,"I couldn't finish watching this movie because of the serious inconsistancies with Scripture. There were three advisors listed in the credits, two priests and a rabbi. I wonder how these Catholic priests allowed their names to be associated with this movie.You can say it is inspirational but if key details are wrong and false, it will ultimately not lead you closer to the Real Jesus because the details are important and relate to the Incarnation as foretold in the Old Testament.Showed Joseph angry, accusational and cruel about Mary's pregancyOmitted Elizabeths greeting of Mary as ""Mother of My Lord""Implied Mary had pain at childbirthOmitted presentation in the TempleShowed Mary as the decision maker in going to EgyptImplied by Jesus' questions that he didn't know he was God.You can learn much more about the life of Jesus looking through the eyes of Mary when you pray the Rosary (which after all is simply the prayer of the Gospel)."
2,Misguided,"While Mary Mother of Jesus has some decent acting for a TV special, its portrayal of Mary is fundamentally misguided. The Mary portrayed here is a cross between a feisty feminist icon and the sinless, deathless Goddess of Roman Catholic piety.The Mary that ISN'T portrayed is the Mary of the Gospels - a good woman with her own set of strengths and flaws who ultimately played a key role in salvation.Note: the theology of this film is PURE Roman Catholicism and is likely to offend other Christian groups. (For example, John the Baptist is shown dribbling water on people and saying Catholic-sounding comments like ""Wash your sins away with water."" I doubt the Baptists in the audience appreciate that much.)"
4,"Jesus & Mary: Strong, Wise Down To Earth Characters","This may very well be my favorite Jesus movie ever. I think this movie has not been given the full attention nor credit that it deserves. The movie starts off showing how Mary was kind, wise and brave in spirit and thus why she was chosen to to give birth to and raise to manhood the Son of God. Nice too is the fact that Jesus while Savior to world is so very down to earth. Mary is respectful to Jesus because she knows he is savior to the world and yet Jesus is respectful to her because she is his earthly mother and the movie that great friendship as mother and son between them. What I like about this Jesus movie it that it is true to Scriptues, noting that Jesus was/is the Savior and Son of God..but ever so tactfully avoiding the the trinitarian vs. the unitarian issue. This is a great movie and I would highly recommend it."
4,Dynamite for any season,Been wanting TRO matertial for many years. Decided to complete the collection and not at all sorry that I did! Good music for all seasons!
2,"Hard on the ears, like rock candy","There is only one great song on this CD, Christmas Canon. It's a masterpiece of Christmas artwork, and thank you for whoever was in charge for doing it. The rest is absolutely a test of your will and patience. The tunes are contrived and repeatitive, I would expect such a menu of songs from my local pub on kareoke night. It is Christmas Canon that brings out the visuals of the true Christmas spirit, the rest would bring Woodstock to shame, its that bad. Do yourself a favor and download the single of Christmas Canon on amazon MP3."
2,TSO Christmas Attic,I was disappointed in this album. I bought it for one song I heard on the radio - Christmas Cannon. I thought the rest of the music would be similar. It was nothing like the one song. Electric guitars and rock music do not belong in an orchestra.
2,waterlooker,Just purchased this cd and I am returning it. If you like symphony Christmas music - don't buy it. I could only listen to 1/2 the tape before I was so angry at myself for buying it that I had to turn it off. The quality is poor and the music is not comfortable listening music. Give it as a gift to someone that you don't like.
1,"The sales guy said ""You can't go wrong""","This has got to be the worst CD I have ever purchased. There are MAYBE three good tracks and the rest is pathetic! Many of the half-way decent tracks are otherwise ruined by a male lead singer who sings like Kathy Lee Gifford. Of course, if you like Kathy Lee's music, then this CD is a must for your collection. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
1,Imagine a Spinal Tap Christmas album,"This is by far, and without question, the worst CD I have ever heard. It's so bad, you can't believe they're serious. It is overproduced, overbearing, and overwrought. It's so bombastic, it would make an Emerson, Lake, and Palmer album sound like a garage band in comparison. I have tried for the last year to sell this disc at any number of used CD stores and none of then will have it. A waste of perfectly good aluminum."
1,Headbangers Christmas,"I saw a snippet of them in a TV commercial for their Christmas CD's and they made it sound like they sounded similar to Mannheim Steamroller but in no way do they sound like the joyous Mannheim Steamroller not even close, they make a joyful noise and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra just makes an angry noise, the guy singing (screaming) the track The Three Wise Men and I, What Really Happened sounded angry and that does not represent the Christmas spirit for me."
4,Good music mix,"As with any album there are usually one or two songs that I do not like, and the Christmas Attic is the same. I bought it for two specific titles, and there are a couple pieces that I do not care for. Overall the Trans Siberian Orchestra plays some great music."
5,The Christmas Attic,"The Christmas Attic contains the Best of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, most notably Christmas Canon. I received the album within a few days of ordering it, in mint condition. I am pleased with the delivery, and with the product."
5,service and quality,"A last minute request from an adolescent grandchild sent me to Amazon. What a surprise and how wonderfully helpful!!! I selected a gift certificate for the grandson working on his PhD and needs many resources which he finds on Amazon. Then I turned to music and found The Christmas Attic for my pastor, a copy for a friend and one more for me to play in my kitchen as I was baking Christmas cookies!!!!Thanks many times. dorothy mason"
4,Like the Music,I went to see Transiberian Orchestra last year in concert and going again this year. I love their music and connection to Christmas. This is the second CD of theirs I have. Recommend it yes..Recommend their concert. yes
5,Awesome stuff,"This album does not have the ""anthem"" song like Christmas Eve Sarajevo 12:24 (which is simply a very high bar to match) on it, but it still has some great orchestral songs that sound amazing.Definitely a much better alternative to the Christmas ""fluff"" one hears at malls during the christmas season."
2,Not that great,"I should have just downloaded the song through Itunes that I wanted. Really, the rest of the CD isn't that great."
5,Magic,There is nothing better than seeing TSO put to video. Their Rock Operas are amazing and filled with beauty. Wonderful wonderful DVD!
3,Powerful and powermaking music,This is the Xmas CD for people who are sick and tired of the same old versions of the same old music. It really brings a new dimension to the genre. My only negative point is that a couple of the songs are too close to each other in sound and sense. What makes this CD stand apart is the sense of POWER that it seems to deliver! Pump out the sound and forget that it is Xmas music.
1,So not what I wanted....,"I was looking for the Christmas Canon and the Transiberian Orchestra I hear on the radio. Since I can't return it because I opened it, I guess I will pass it along or just throw it out."
2,One good one,"I bought this for ""Christmas Canon"" and that one selection made the purchase worthwhile. I was disappointed that there were no others on the album that I really enjoyed. I don't know why. I guess they just weren't Christmassy enough."
2,Unusual but Not Quite Up to Expectations,"I love the Christmas Canon but the rest of the songs didn't measure up. I should have investigated it better before purchasing it. I think if this was a live performance it would be worth it, but the CD just doesn't cut it."
3,Better in person,"We went to a TSO concert, then purchased this CD. We were disappointed that we didn't recognise most of the songs on there."
5,Review,"That is an absolutely amazing CD. We purchased it for the Christmas Canon song. My now wife used it as the entrance to our wedding, so this CD will always hold a special spot in my heart."
1,"If you're looking for traditional Christmas music, skip this","I saw those darling children performing on the Today Show and thought this album would be more music like that. I was surprised and disappointed. I would return it if I could and certainly won't be playing it to create a Christmas atmosphere. This is not traditional Christmas music and certainly not easy listening. I found myself skipping to the next song to find a good one; sorry, not there."
1,Pathetic,"If Queen had made a Christmas album, it might have sounded something like this. Either that, or there's a Broadway production somewhere waiting for an incredibly lame score. I bought this based on the very pretty ""Christmas Canon"" song, but soon found out that was the lone good song. The rest of the album is so overwrought and pretentious that I could barely listen to it. The 70's style electric guitar was especially annoying. And I won't even go into the singing. This album makes Meat Loaf seem subtle. Unless you're a fan of 1970's prog rock, skip this cd and go for other Christmas music instead."
2,If I could return it I would.,"Although there are some good tracks, who wants to keep hitting the ""skip"" button to get to a good song? Some tracks are ""christmasy"", but some are just plain weird.I had hoped for something that the whole family would enjoy; this CD just wasn't it."
2,"Christmas music? Yah, right!","Well, actually it's trying to be Christmas music. I give it two stars for effort. However, almost all of the music is buried under heavy metal like noise that can only be described as annoying and agitating. I only managed to pick out two songs on the whole CD that I actually could tolerate (and they were actually fairly mellow). Now that I opened it, I wish I could take it back to the store for a refund.I also cringed when I heard in several songs what was supposed to be singing. It was awful.If you are looking for traditional Christmas music in a classical sense, don't even think about purchasing this. I wanted to be open minded about my purchase, and usually I am fairly satisfied. Not this time. This was a total waste of my money."
1,Fascinating listen.,"If you've ever thought to yourself, ""Man, i love Meatloaf's Bat Out of Hell albums. But HOW could i capture that magical feeling for the holidays?"" Well, you've found it. That's right, folks. If you always thought that your holiday music didn't have enough electric guitars mixed with a New Age sense, then you came to the right place.How about this. How about the first two Manheim Steamrollers Christmas albums. They have carols dating back to the Middle Ages, many somewhat unknown, played in the classic style, with classical instruments. And yes, others are new age. Luckily, they don't really mix them in the same songs...and NOT with Meatloaf style electric guitars."
2,The Christmas Attic,I guess you had to see the performance but I got lost in the songs. A few favorites include the canon with children's voices but the rest seemed like a lot of yelling to great background music.
3,Okay cd,Really only liked one of the songs :/ some songs just weren't Christmacy enough. Loved Christmas Canon though. :) :)
2,Vocals - no,I prefer the orchestra without the vocals. Other albums are more enjoyable for my listening preference. This one does not make me want to listen to it very often.
5,Great,"I thought this cd was great. the music is traditional and beautiful. These days Christmas songs are all about snowmen and insignificant romances. These songs don't seem so secular. I can't believe that one reviewer said that the songs were too religious for him/her. Why do you celebrate Christmas anyway? There is a point. It's too bad that people shy away from Christmas songs that actually have meaning- that may even mention Christ. Christmas songs should be religious. Anyway, this cd is worth buying along with other Trans-Siberian Orchestra cd's."
3,sequel,"This album, while still musically sound, tries way to hard to duplicate the ""Christmas Eve and Other Stories"" album. There's another touching story woven thgoughout the songs, but the instrumentals simply lack the power of the first album. Worth buying, worth listening to more than once, but I don't jam to it in the car like I do with ""Christmas Eve and Other Stories."""
3,"Powerful Orchestra, Weak Vocals","I found this CD a major disappointment. I've heard the orchestral music before and liked it a lot. I found the synth and guitars powerful, but at least half this CD features vocals that just don't measure up. I'd prefer a whole CD with no vocals at all."
1,Some of the worst crap I've ever heard!,"If you're looking for something ""Orchestral"" or ""Trans-Siberian - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY. If your into the ""Garage Band"" sound with lots of drums, distorted electric guitars and screaming for the most part (rather than singing), look no further. Just a few cuts into it, I was ready to run it through my wood chipper (my wood chipper has a more pleasing sound!). Maybe I can heat it up and form it into a Christmas Ornament, NAH! This disc is in the top 2 or 3 worst that I have heard in my life."
1,Not what I expected after hearing the first album,"I must say that I am disappointed in this group for singing on most of there tracks. I bought this CD thinking it was strictly ""instrumental"", like the first one, but got alot less instrumental and more singing. There are only three songs that aren't vocal. I prefer the first one. However, others may not agree with my kind of ""taste"" for their music."
3,Not what I thought it would sound like,I gave the CD to my granddaughter who likes this kind of music and even she didn't care for it a lot.
5,On Bangkok Blue,"I love this album because it takes the beautiful instruments (gongs, metallophones etc...) found in the Gamelan orchestras of Bali, Java and Thailand and combines them with the best of western harmony and popular instrumentation. It makes the genius of ancient Indonesian music more accessible to a modern audience. Its one of the few new age albums that I can recommend to people who don't normally listen to new age music. My mother loves it. Most everything else in the New Age category is too limp for her. This album could also be placed in the International/World music category."
2,"Neat plot, clumsy writing","I won't repeat the elements of the plot (which is refreshingly original, especially for a Regency romance) since other reviewers have done so but I have to say that the writing is very awkward. The reader is told that a character feels a certain way, then the dialogue that comes out of her mouth is totally at odds with this. This is a pattern in the book, and is at its worst with the main characters, Regina and Jules. In addition, not one character ever really comes alive or seems three-dimensional. Regina's mother, supposedly a warm, loving person, gives her daughters platitudes for advice, doesn't act in a way consistent with her supposed ""illness,"" and is improbably connected to anyone who can move the plot along.Too bad that this inventive plot was squandered with stilted writing!"
2,Slow as Molasses in Winter,"I just could not get through this book. I've enjoyed other works from this author, particularly ""The Unexpected Wife"", but this one was just too slow. The characters had a ""cardboard cutout"" feel, as if the author was recording their activities from the outside, without ever taking the reader into the characters' heads."
4,Unique Approach,"As a reporter, James maintains an objective position on Cuba in this thin, highly readable, enjoyable book. He presents the good, bad, and in-between of the Cuban revolution through the stories of three directly impacted by it. It is left to the reader to decide if the revolution worked, failed, or is still evolving."
1,Martex miPillow - Nice Pillow -- Irritating Sound System.,"This Musical Pillow seems like a good idea and it does work but the sound is terrible. It has all the audio fidelity of a 1950's transistor radio playing under your pillow. As advertised it wirelessly links any MP3 player to a remote transmitor in the supplied ""pillow pocket"" but the sound from the pillow is so irritating to the ear that it defeats the whole idea of listening to audio as you go to sleep.The supplied pillow though is of excellent quality. So, because of the expense of returning the ""opened"" product to Amazon.com for a 50% refund minus shipping I've decided to keep the $39.99 pillow and chalk this one up to a very, very bad ""early-adopter"" experience. Do Not waste your money on this product."
2,A good idea needing refinement,"I thought this pillow would solve my problem of going to sleep with music and not disturb the rest of the household. While the pillow worked as designed, the design needs improvement. The reciever and the transmitter should be activated and shut off through the music player. It doesn't make much sense to have to wake up to turn the device off -- and if you don't, it has a healthy appetite for batteries. The quality of the speaker leaves a lot to be desired, also."
1,"Awful, awful, awful!","Don't even think about buying this product at this time. It does not work the way they think it does. The sound is terrible and the pillow is not comfortable. I got this for my sister, even though it had pretty bad reviews, because she wanted it so much. Bad idea...it stinks and she was super disappointed. I am sure, with the technology out there, this product can be much better eventually. Sorry my review is so harsh, but it needs to be. I really feel they can put out a much better product."
1,This thing is a piece of junk!,"Because me wife was so sick and stuck in bed I ordered this even with the negative reviews. What a mistake! The reciever picked up a nasty hum everywhere in the bedroom, even after turning off everything else in the room and then the whole house, totally useless. Well she's gone now and not much point in returning it, I'll just add it to the other stuff no longer needed. I only write this to save others from wasting their time and money."
5,a hidden gem,"Tried to find this book in a bookstore, and it appears to be self-published, but available online. I can find nothing about the author at all. No matter, this is without doubt the funniest and most unique book I've read in years. It's hard to pin down the story - it's more a free-flight fantasy into the minds of marginally functional people desperately clinging to their version of happiness, fighting the insanity of the `normal' people that surround them. If you ever wanted to laugh at the concept of `coping', this is the book for you. It's great to see a writer on the outermost fringe of publishing produce this sort of work."
2,Dubbed in crowd noise ?,"I believe this is a live recording. However, the crowd noise seems dubbed. ""Extended Versions"" implies studio remixes - . Things could be worse. I could have paid shipping."
5,desert eagle,"This thing is awesome. So far I dont have any complaints about it. The slide goes back over 2 inches and the whole pistol is longer than my forearm. The grip is really big so anyone with small hands this may not be the pistol for you. It ways around 2-3 pounds any is about 10 inches long. It is alsao probably the easiest gas pistol I have ever taken apart. It is all plastic except for the hammer, trigger, and safety switch. the magazine is also metal except for the top part. so overall this is a great gun and if you see this in stock and your debating between two pistols get this."
5,Flight,a good read even if you have never watched Smallville these books are very enjoyable for any Superman fan. some titles I would love to purchase but not available to overseas buyers.
2,Super Reader,"A kid's book. Large print, lots of spacing and all that sort of thing. This is another meteor freak story. A girl is basically held captive by her father, and not allowed to do much at all.When Clark starts working at a pizza place, her meets her, and after an accident, discovers she has wings. Not just her, her whole family. They work on teaching her to fly so she can find her mother."
4,could be better,"when clark meets a shy young lady at a carnival, he starts to suspect that she may be abused by her father. when he uses his xray vision to confirm this, he finds that she is hiding a muchbigger secret. on top of this, people are starting to get robbed.could the 2 be connected? or is it just another item for the wallof the weird? this book starts out with a lot of promise but it goes downhill really fast. from the samllville books i have read fans are better off just watching the tv show."
4,Valuable book,"I was enlightened by reviewer Jim's information about the Dylan show. The book does indeed call it the ""lost"" Midnight Special, but even that's not entirely true. I have this Dylan show on DVD. After 30 years, it was bound to surface. I wasn't exactly blown away because not that many of the songs from Blood On The Tracks were played like they were in the live Rolling Thunder shows, which I attended one in Ft. Worth. Nonetheless, the book is a valuable reference guide to The Midnight Special. And after all this time, who can argue whether or not the airdates or correct? Regarding Dylan fussing about camera angles and closeups, hell, he sold out long ago, so his so-called anti-establishment persona doesn't mean much anymore. He should just release the show himself and get some more moolah rolling in."
2,More a pamphlet than a book,"The by-line of this book should have been my clue to its antiquity. I don't mind resources that are a bit older (i.e. ""classic"") but this particular title suffers from the verbosity so fashionable in it's day yet so annoying now. It just too text heavy. Using words to teach light and shadow is like using ducks to teach chemistry...in other words, ineffective. This is a concept best explained through illustration and while there are some here, there isn't enough and they aren't very effective. It's just not presented well for a simple minded novice like me. It is a reasonable pamphlet, but not a great book."
3,"Good for the price, I guess!","The book has many interesting facts. Only problem I see, it doesn't supply the answers to the trivia questions.....nowhere! Can prove to be very frustrating. But I guess for the money, it's worth it!"
1,Not worth the time,I bought 6 of these. The first one I tried cracked at the middle coupler...the plastic just broke in half when I tried to insert my cables. Build quality is very flimsy....cheap cheap cheap. Cables fit too tight in the coupling. Not even going to mess with the rest of them.
1,Very bad product,"this is the worst product ever, the quality of the image gets very degraded when you use this coupler, don't buy or you will regret it."
5,coupler,worked great in extending my existing cords. saved trip to buy a longer cord. easy coupling with no problems. thanks
2,Gettysburg Screen Saver,"This so called ""music video"" for Gettysburg is a farce. OK, even if I was wrong in expecting it to me a ""music"" video, I feel I was a least warented in thinking it to be a video. It is nothing more than slow moving maps, faces, ans some poorly digitized cannons. I feel that this is a poor product released only so Jon could talk about History. I know he loves history. So do I, but he is a musician. He should have at least added somthing that would have improved the Gettysburg trilogy, not cheapened it. This dvd is disapointing at best.On the up side, the two real music videos are cool, and there is a good doc in there somewhere, if you can get beyond the long and painful introductions. Enjoy..."
3,a letdown,"the dvd gettysburg to me has been a letdown, expecting it to be a video i was relatively excited, upon purchasing the dvd and watching it i got bored real quick! seeing the intro to the devil to pay wasnt bad but i was telling myself, alright whens it goin to pick up, when am i goin to see something interesting, nothing more than floating pictures, maps canons and the occasional flames, nothing exciting. you could just as easily pop in the glorious burden into the cd drive, play the trilogy and watch tv at the same time, however the tv will entertain you and the pictures floating will not. the only thing that redeemed this dvd were the extras, the interview with schaffer and the music videos to when the eagle cries and the reckoning were also very cool, i do mean real music videosid only recommend this to the hardcore iced earth fan who gets excited over moving pictures"
2,Might start another Civil War,"lame brain insane wannabe...lack of talent...singer's bad ...reject from Judas Priest... When Eagles Cry is silly sappy Winger inspired- like when country singers wanna be patriotic ""I'm a Ford truck Man""...lacks historic insight..probably just watched a movie like God's and Generals and then wrote this...not prog metal...but they seem to want to be...The Reckoning is pretty good and saves this from a one star rating...those that like this are merely searching in a sea or should I say battlefield of bad music. If you really want good prog metal get a Symphony X CD. The excerpts from Gettysburg sound unfoccussed...needs massive arranging skills to clean this up...""hey let's add a cello and a bagpipe and everyone will take us seriously"""
5,Metal on a mission,"Anyone who has heard Gettysburg knows that the music is excellent, and the lyrics are powerful. The video is incredible. With a combination of still and live shots, including both re-enactors and actual photographs from the Civil War, the powerful, terrible story of Gettysburg is told in all its grandeur and tragedy.To make a modern reference for those who don't understand, more men died in three days on that blood-soaked battlefield than the US has lost in four years of war since 9-11. The Battle of Gettysburg was awful, and tragic and grand, and, ultimately, necessary for the preservation of our nation. For most metal bands, it would have been an act of foolish hubris to try to make this video about such a momentous event.Iced Earth stepped up to the plate and knocked it out of the park."
4,Unexpected,"This dvd was not at all what I expected. I thought it was just going to be one big music video for the song. How Jon decided to make this dvd was much, much more entertaining. History buffs will get the most from this, but people that just liked the song won't be dissapointed. The interviews are also good, only complaints for the whole thing was that Jon sounded a little cocky during parts of the interviews, and the effects of flames on the maps during the song was a bit corny. Easily worth buying."
3,"plays fine, but","This cd plays fine, love the music. When loaded on an xp machine, it displays fine, but when loaded on a win7 machine it displays in some foreign language. The advertising for it did not mention that I would have to do a bunch of media player editing to be able to read it. It was purchased as a used cd and does play fine. I love the nature sounds and the original music. I find it very relaxing."
4,very nice piano and nature combo,"As a birdwatcher and woodland hiker this cd captures a lot of that mood.It is very nice and quiet and relaxing, but, I ran across a problem with the cd, on first play the track 8 did not play,I replayed track 7, and then track 8 played after 7 was finished, as it should, thus the reason for a 4 star rating instead of 5."
5,My birds love it and so do I,Fabulous...absolutely fabulous classical piano with amazing birds singing in the background. I play this for my birds and they sing along too.
5,Great Lullaby music,"My parents gave me this CD several years ago--it was playing in a garden store they were in, and as I play the piano, and love to be outdoors, they picked it up for me. I admit, it was nice to relax to, but was just one of the many relaxing CDs I owned.Then our baby daughter came along, and it has become THE ""now it's time to lay down and sleep"" CD. In fact one time I went to put another soothing CD in, (although I'm a big fan, I needed a little change from every nap & nighttime-put-to-bed for 5 months), and my husband said, ""No! She goes to sleep to the Forest/Bird/Piano one! Nothing else will be played."" So, I hope our copy, which was already well loved, lasts awhile longer...You will not be disappointed with this CD."
5,A beautiful song receives gracious arrangements.,"This CD is enchanting from the very start. The variety of renditions keeps the listener tuned in. While it would be hard to imagine anyone purchasing this CD that didn't like the title song, the music is wonderful, especially when shuffled with other similar music on a multiplay CD player."
2,A Disappointment,"I loved the movie ""The Descendants"" so was fully prepared to love this book. However, while recognizing the mini-story that was broadened to a movie, I'm struggling through the rest of the book. So far, there appears to be too much introspection and not enough action in each of the stories. And each story seems to be formulaic, including a ""hanging ending."" I can't bring myself to care about the characters enough to want to consider them beyond the ending of each tale. And, I'm not certain I will actually complete reading the book."
3,Not worth my time,A series of short stories about disgruntled teens. Well written but each was a variation on a theme. I wouldn't rush to buy or read it.
1,Booooring!,I usually don't review books but this has got to be one of the most boring books I've ever tried to read. I'm only half way through the second story and I'm done. Next?
1,Hated this book...,"Maybe I'm just not used to this kind of book, with all the short short stories, but when I finished, I was scratching my head and thinking, ""Well, that was a waste of time""."
4,It's worth every second,"From The Heart is a really fine CD. The musicianship and vocal work is excellent. The sound production is pretty good though I think it could have been a little better. It seemed there were some spots where I had to tweak the volume on way or another.. maybe a little heavy on the reverb here and there. But there's no way I'd let any of that stop you from getting this CD. It's worth every second ""Chris Lonsberry"""
5,"""CAUTION""...YOU CAN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN ONCE YOU START..","RICHARD MARCINKO TAKES YOU ALONG FOR THE RIDE WITH THE ELITE NAVY SEALS, IT'S A NO HOLDS BAR RIDE TO THE WILD SIDE OF FAST ACTION SEAL EXCITEMENT. ""DEMO DICK"" HAS HIS OWN STYLE AND VOCABULARY THAT WILL SUCK YOU INTO THE WORLD OF THE NAVY SEALS. MARCINKO IS A REAL LIFE NAVY SEAL WHO PULLS NO PUNCHES WITH HIS SUPERIORS OR HIS READERS...IT'S A MUST READ FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES EXCITEMENT !!!"
5,Exciting,"It is an extreme pleasure to read the writings of Richard Marcinko. He is truly a one of a kind individual. I love his non-fiction, so I tried one of his fictional tales. It was incredibly entertaining and enjoyable. I hope to collect them all!"
5,The frog man lives,"This is the one of the few books that I have found that will have you laughing and wanting to join the adventures of Marcinko's band of marauders. My heart was pumping a mile a minute with the thought of what they were doing. With colorful characters like Stevie Wonder,Doc Tremblay, Nasty Nick, and Duck Foot you would enjoy ever minute you read this book."
2,"""Total Tattoo Book"" totally incomplete","I must start by saying that I am considerably disappointed with this book. The author spends a lot of time boasting about being a ""tattooed Jew"", tooting her own horn for organizing a tattoo convention in New York, and talking about how ""tattooed people are ok!"" and ""bikers are just like everyone else"". There is definately too much chatter and not enough information. The list of tattoo studios in the back of the book is not a very good resource, as the information there is highly likely to change, such as addresses and phone numbers. There are a lot of black and white photos, not ""many in color!"" as the back of the book claims, and most of the pictures can be found in any number of other books on the subject. The book was inexpensive, and may provide some insight into tattooing in New York, but it lacks substance and isnt worth much more than a quick read."
2,not what i expected,"im a big fan of body art. i read and research alot about it. i also have four tattoos of my own and plan on getting more. i even dated a tattoo artist for a short period of time. i hung out at the tattoo shop every day and was around 5-10 artists at a time every day. i know my stuff. but by no means am i out writing a book on tattoos.with that said.this book was not the ""total tattoo book"" i expected. it mostly told me stuff i already knew, had bad pictures, and talked way to much about her personal experiences. i was bored and even skipped sentences at times just to finish it. but i did finish it out of respect for the author and give her two stars.1 star for her efforts1 star because its about tattoos"
3,A bit much about Amy.,"This book isn't badly written, but isn't the ""Total Tattoo Book"" as she claims it to be. The book centers around New York's tattoo scene, and mostly old-school, male, tattoo artists. Amy claims to be an insider, but all she really is, is a convention promoter."
3,Ok for beginers or newbies,"This book will be ok if you know nothing about the tattoo world and are interested in it. Just scratches the surface of everything about tattooing. Fast easy read but don't buy it for pictures. I agree with ""not to sure"" post."
3,A quick read,"I title this a quick read since I skipped alot. Some of it is good, but most of what is good you could get in one Tattoo magazine. Some nice pictures. Ms. Krakow bypasses details in favor of an entire chapeter on permanent makeup, that is way longer than it should be. Could've been alot better."
5,what a bargain!,"When I told guys on the course and on the range how much I paid for this club, they could not believe it. Compared to what they have spent on clubs, this club is s steal. It does everything I want it to do; from the sand trap to the rough around the green. Great back spin on shots; great control...this was a great bargain!!!!"
2,A disappointing Nutcracker,"The summary above says the the scenario has been updated to a ""more mature"" level. In my opinion, this means that the former scenario that many of us grew up with is virtually gone. The giant Christmas tree, for instance, is no longer. So while the video and audio quality are fine, the content is not. Also, Gergiev's conducting is overdriven and charmless."
1,just forget,"these are probably the best dancers on a blu-ray.., but the sets, clothes and artistic choices, everything is horrible and annoying. it is a beautiful mess with the best dancers of the moment. take the version of the royal opera house until something better. especially if you prefer flowers rather than snakes, bees and heads of death. :("
3,adequately warm,Keeps my fingers warm as long as it is not bone chillingly cold (I live in the northeast). Good for formal occasions where I can't wear my ski gloves!
4,Not Kingdom of Heaven - thankfully,"It's not Kingdom of Heaven and thankfully so, but this movie is not perfect(really is a 3.5 star movie). As usual in this day and age when the West continues to be attacked by Muslim fanatics, the Christians and Jews are the bad guys. As for the DVD, good picture, but I found the dialogue difficult to hear at times - audio recording not the best considering the environment being filmed in? I found the scene with the Jew attacking the camp confusing - why? what was the explanation? It just seemed like a forced scene to cause the Knight to lose it. Anyway, the actor who played the Knight should have played Orlando Bloom's character in KoH - better looking, more rugged and saltier than Orlando."
5,"Chips, Chips & More Chips",Another great transaction from Amazon. This item arrived very quickly and was exactly as described. Couldn't be happier!
1,Horrible! Nestlé is better by far!,"First I want to say I love most all Hershey's candy bars. That's why I was so surprised when I made my famous home made chocolate chip cookies with this brand (instead of what I normally use, Nestlé) and they tasted so bad I had to throw out the entire batch. Nothing more to say, they were that bad and I was hugely dissapointed.For full disclosure I did not buy these at Amazon so to prove I did buy and try them I include a photo above. You'll see I also tried the milk chocolate chips. They were horrible too."
2,Didn't Care For It,"I've read a few of Bentley Little's novels (The Resort, The Association, The Store) and really liked them. I picked up Dispatch and started reading it and I have to say it, but I hated it. For me, the constant descriptions about being a letter writer and how important it was was like nails on a chalkboard. I get that he loves writing letters but it doesn't have to be on every 5 pages. I will still read Bentley Little's novels because they are great. This one, however, I didn't care for it."
3,Dispatch: the book and the process,"Dispatch was recommended by my son, who's 25 years old - he is an inveterate letter-writer and extremely creative with language arts. I found the book most interesting in the first half - before some of the stranger incidents take place. It did make me think a great deal about the power of the written word...we have become so used to infobytes and 'shorthand' that for those who are less than 30 years old or so, it might be hard to connect with the notion of full sentences, paragraphs and articles or books.What was absolutely 5-star was the process of buying these book: Amazon is fast, amazingly low-cost, and the books were in much better condition than I'd expected. No more book stores for me...thanks!"
2,Definitely not Little's best work,"I LOVE Bentley Little's books - but this one was a bit boring, and certainly not his best work. As I read it, I was constantly reminded of the Ignored; I think the writing style and the main characters were similar.I had a hard time maintaining my interest with this one."
3,"first 1/2 was great...second 1/2, not so much","The first part of this book was really good, really interesting, and I read through it fast. then about 1/2 through, it just started to get a bit boring, and drawn out, and I wasn't impressed with the ending at all."
4,Very Imaginative,"Dispatch is a unique story about how someone that writes complaint letters to everyone from the neighborhood burger joint to amusement parks gets free stuff (and some attention) for his troubles. It also plays a little on corporations' mentality to throw money at anything that might seem like a problem or bad PR. I love the whole ""world"" created for the letter writers so that they will stay focused on their tasks and make sure that things go the way they are meant to in the real world. Very enjoyable read. Third of Little's novels that I have read. If you're a horror fan and like your stories interesting and not just of the typical werewolf, monster, vampire variety, give this one a try."
3,Dispatch,The book sounded better than it turned out to be. I really like Bentley Little but this is on the bottom of the list of his books that I've read so far. Still not a bad read though.
2,A Horror Novel that is Horrible,"This was my first Bentley Little novel and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because, like so many other reviewers have stated, the first 200 pages of the book are very good. As soon as he took the mysterious job (the whole premise of the book) it went downhill fast. The ending was just plain stupid. At NO point while reading this book did I get chills, I never felt any rush of fear that a good horror novel brings on. Frankly I just finished reading the awful thing just to see what/who the Ultimate was. I am going to try another Little book because I think the books sound really good but I sure hope the Resort doesn't fall apart like this story did."
2,Interesting idea gone astray,"This was a pretty good book up about two-thirds the way through it then it just got goofy. George Washington? Abe Lincoln? Are we serious here? Scissors? I will admit that it kept my interest throughout. For the first two-thirds or so it was a good thriler that kept me guessing and trying to figure out where our totally unlikable hero was going. The last third of the book was just a trip down ludicrous lane where I was fascinated by the ridiculous turn of the plot. The Ultimate battle, and I do mean Ultimate, was simply silly. Kyoto deserved a better fate. And what about Stan? The idea of who/what Stan was is something I saw in an early episode of Doctor Who. Then what about Vicky? How to contact her? He had to think about that? He was a Letter writer for goodness sake!!! Anyway, this wasn't a terrible book, but it isn't one I would recommend as a great read either."
3,Among Little's Top 3,"Bentley Little's strong suit is his imagination for creating horror shows from activities most people would be hard-pressed to see as anything more than boring (insurance policies, college life, wineries, postal service).That is why DISPATCH rates higher than the one star I give most of his other books.Dispatch has some of what makes me believe one day I will read another novel by Little that can live up to The Ignored: a great story. While his other novels begin with truly interesting ideas and rapidly devolve into various (yet recycled-feeling) scenes of sex, blood, rape, torture, and other jacked-up activities, Dispatch manages to avoid this downfall for most of the story.I suggest for anyone interested in this author, in descending order: 1)The Ignored, 2)Dispatch, 3)The Association."
4,One of the best...,"Let me start by saying that this book is not for everyone (full of fantasy, some sexual situations), but if you have read Bentley Little, you know what you are in for. The pen is mightier than the sword in this saga. Scary in that it may sometimes be closer to reality than one wants to imagine. Jason, the main character, son in a dysfunctional family, finally discovers his voice, writing letters that get results. The bizarre ending was a little off (thus only 4 stars), but I would rate it equal to The Store and The Association."
2,Do not read Bentley Little!!!!!!,"This book started out well, but it wore itself out due to monotony. Examples were given over and over and over again about how the main character writes letters to get free stuff and bring about change. I had to stop reading because I said to myself, ""I get it! You write letters to get what you want, now get on with the story.""Bentley Little's books are all very similar. He takes an ordinary entity (writing letters, convenient store chains, mailmen, college, homeowners association, resorts, insurance policies) and he turns it into an absurd oppressive force that involves violence and sex. I don't understand why he is so famous or so widely read."
3,"Weird, odd and unique!","I found this book to be very fast paced and easy to get into. This is probably the fastest I've read one of Little's books (except maybe Dominion which is one of my favs)and it only took me about 3-4 days to read it b/c I wanted to know what was going to happen. Like most of Little's books he takes something as everyday as writing letters and turns it into the plot of a sinister, weird tale. Jason is a Letter Writer (yes with capitals) who with the power of his letters get free food, entertainment, better jobs, school scholarships and even causes a few deaths along the way. When Jason is offered a job that opens his eyes to the fact that he is not the only Letter Writer, the story gets even more bizarre. Like many of the books I've read of Little, his build up is sometimes better than the conclusion, but overall it's still one of his more interesting books. Probably one of his weirdest novels, and goes well with The Mailman, which both make letters and mail frightening!"
2,Logo just too much,"The tote I received (from the marketplace seller) looked very similar to the picture, but had a large white 'Kenmore' logo permanently adhered to it on the notion side above the zipper. The logo, to me, was too visible on this dark tapestry and it took away from the beauty of the bag. I may have given the tote itself 4 stars but took away 2 because of the large permanent commercial branding."
3,nice bag but,I should have spent the extra and gotten the one with wheels. By the time you fill this one it is way too heavy to carry. My mistake. Plus I fee like my grandma. I may change this to a car travel overnight bag.
2,Not for beginners,"The content of this dance instruction tape was far more advanced than the words on the box would indicate. They assume previous knowledge of the basic swing steps and jump right into some complex moves. If you know the basics and have practiced a while, you might find this tape worthwhile, but beginners should choose a different tape."
3,Not what I had hoped,This tape didn't meet my needs. It assumed the student understood the basic Lindy and Jitterbug steps used and didn't take enough time to discribe or adequately show how to perform the routines they used. Definely for the more advanced swing student in Lindy and jitterbug.
5,"A simple, whimsical story brought to life with expressive color illustrations, especially suitable for bedtime reading","Moon Man is a children's picturebook about the adventure of the Man in the Moon, who years to know what it's like to dance. He catches a comet to Earth, but human beings fear and distrust him - a mean-spirited general even sends him to prison! He escapes, finally gets to dance, and takes a spacecraft back to the moon knowing that he can never live peacefully on Earth. A simple, whimsical story brought to life with expressive color illustrations, especially suitable for bedtime reading."
5,Pretty good receiver,"I'm not a stereo hobbyist, but by my standards this receiver works great. On the downside it has many settings governed by a small number of buttons which aren't covered in the manual in any way I can understand. After some weeks I still don't understand many of them. On the other hand it has a special ""matrix"" feature that allows weak FM stations to come in clearly. If you happen to have a FTA satellite receiver with Dolby-Digital pass-through and are picking up signals from AMC 3, this receiver will decode the audio on stations which otherwise are silent."
4,dixie carter is amazing and funny,"This album of Wallowitch's music is really amuzing at times and very funny. If you like the antics of Julia Sugarbaker, on Designing Women, you'll love imagining her singing these songs in typical Julia style., especially since Dixie Carter, ( the star of the album), will always be the one and only "" Julia Sugarbaker"". This album is a hoot and Dixie carter has an incredible voice."
1,Jumping through ... hoops,"She certainly looks the part, but doesn't sound it. I know a cabaret singer doesn't need to have a ""perfect voice"" --- well Ms. Carter certainly doesn't. The problem is that her voice is actually difficult to listen to. She may be able to sell the song onstage, but on a recording, her poor voice is so distracting, I couldn't enjoy any emotion she may have been putting into her music.Her vibrato is so wide someone could actually jump through it. I found myself cringing. Now, perhaps her acting abilities helped during her live show ... but, it doesn't translate to this recording. Certainly not enought to make it worth buying"
5,Bridge,Kato is up there in the model train world and this bridge is no exception. Mind you that the track is a Kato ready but you can remove the ends (or the whole track) and use anyway you want.
3,Pleasant music,"Greetings. Has heard this disk. Easy, not straining music which it is pleasant to listen for New Year or during holiday on the sea (it is desirable in a condition of alcoholic intoxication). I apologize for the English. Translation from Russian on English is made by the computer."
4,2001 Nights and other great worlds,"I bought this book in the spring while I was in college studying comics. When you read so many comics, even the good ones seem to go pale. This graphic novel made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. With mature visuals and sensitive writing Yukinobu Hoshino sows accurately the vastness of the universe and the importance of human destiny within it and beyond it. The occasional over-explaining takes away very little in this epic. A great read by anyone's standards; comics fan or not."
4,Pirate spy-glass,Spy-glass was an authentic looking toy for kids 10yrs and under.Adults were surprised I found such a great looking toy. Looking through the spy-glass seemed blury; but that's because the magnification really worked! My 4yr old nephew was thrilled with the flashlight; but adults like myself found the bright red beam to be too much for the eyes. I'd recommend this toy for any little Pirate.
2,Arrived in Poor Condition and not all Walnut,"The bowl arrived in poor condition, not from the shipping. There were several chips in the lacquer finish around the upper edge and a crack in the wood. Being a woodworker, it was apparent this bowl is not made completely of walnut. It's too light in weight, and some of the layers are a stained lighter wood, not walnut. Otherwise, it has a nice shape. I'll probably see if I can get an exchange in good condition."
2,This does not fit the standard pipe length,"I love the tub spout, but it does not fit the standard pipe length. We didn't keep it because we didn't want to mess with cutting the current piping."
4,Full Flow,"This album, from the opening,has a smooth flowing texture that gives it a care-free vibe and it almost seems like the album was recorded completely live in one take in the studio. All the songs flow like day and night and the song qualities really have a symbalism to the moods and atmosphere of both parts of the day. Very enjoyable Smooth Jazz.Ben.the 15 year old."
4,Why this is doing so well on the charts :,"This is a brilliant album. Technically excellent, perfectly balanced (from catchy tunes like ""Hollywood and vine"", ""Aqua funk"", to more spiritual ones like ""China Bath""), with a unique voice on the caressing ""soul on soul"" (track number 8 : Maysa Leak is former lead singer of Incognito, Jean Paul Maulnick's band). I can hardly see anything negative on this album, which is probably one of the best in its genre released in the past 6 months, together with JK's ""What's the word"" and Jeff Lorber's ""Midnight"". Rick Braun proves it is possible to play the trumpet without being too ""classical"" or too ""jazzy"", and keeps improving with each new album."
1,I hope the islands don't lack the soul this CD does.,"Completely disappointed. No soul, no tradition. Save your money unless you're into UB40 and synthesized reggae...ugh. It is all to obvious why there are no samples of this CD on the web page. I took one for the team...buyer beware. SUPPORT LOCAL MUSIC."
5,GREAT ALBUM,THIS ALBUM IS WONDERFUL LENNY YOUR GREAT I LOVE SONGS 2-4-6-8- EULA LAWRENCE WAS THE GUEST ARTIST ON THIS ALBUM SHE IS JUST FABULOUS .KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK WE WILL AWAIT YOUR NEXT ALBUM AND HOPEFULLY EULA LAWRENCE WILL BE WITH YOU AGAIN.. KLP
1,Bad tools,"Please don't waste your money.The tools are not ussable. There are very bad sharpened. They can no cut even paper.The materias is OK, but if you want the tools to be usefull you must sharp them with stone and you'll spend too much time.Better to buy some other tools."
1,"I wanted to learn how to machine, not look at pictures.","I bought this book because I am a raw beginner and wanted a good step-by-step book to teach myself with. This book had a lot, I mean a lot, of pictures of other peoples' work, which would have been nice if I had wanted a picture book. I would have liked a lot more instruction. I'm sorry to say I sent this one back."
1,Paying a lot for a set of application notes?,I was not too impressed about this book which is to a large extent a collection of Sherline's application notes and parts catalog. These would be available for free from Sherline's website. The book explains very little about machining and does not include any projects - however the color figures are nicely colored.
4,Tabletop Machining,"A very good book for the beginning/wannabe machinist. This book seems tocover it all. It goes to great lengths to explain every aspect of machining.Don't let the title fool you, what you can do with a tabletop machine you can also do with something very much larger. The techniques are the same only the sizeis different. The best part is that it does not use the ""school type format"" youknow the format that goes into the history of what you're about to do and then theyshow pictures from some giant machine shop that you can't even imagine. This bookshows what you need to know and how to do it yourself. I enjoyed the book andI recommend it to anyone who wants to start machining."
4,brilliant dance single--but the non-LP tracks are downtempo....,"For those unfamiliar with this band, Shiny Toy Guns has brought 80s electronic music to the new millennium. LOVE the song ""You Are the One"", which is just a taste of the brilliance of the entire album.My main reason for getting this disc is the 2 tracks that weren't on the LP. I'm happy to have them because I'm a completist, but I was hoping for at least one of them to have the energy that the album tracks offer. ""Weather Girl"" is a minimalistic, downtempo electronic track, with alternating vocals between the male and female singer. Very catchy vocals and melody, but it would have been great to have a dance remix because the song could totally work in that format. ""I Promise You Walls"" is sung entirely by the female, and is extremely moody with barely any rhythm track at all. Had it been on the album, it would have been considered filler. It's not a track I'd want to listen to over and over again."
4,a great book for mechanical engineering students,"when the proff. don't say and discuss the importent topics in the class,this book gives you all what you need to understand what is going on.. note:Anderson is talking aver nice way about HRR-field..but he did not give the exp. proof for this theory..."
4,Very Good!,"The book is wonderful introduction to Fracture Mechanics. There are couple of glaring errors in the book, which hopefully will be corrected in the next editions. Apart from that I would recommend it to all those who are trying to get their basics right in fracture mechanics."
3,I,"It isn't entirely clear from the product description, but it should be known that this is just the first volume of a two volume set. It's not a bad buy, but it would be more economical to buy both volumes in one."
4,"The Real ""Rock""","Former Bro' Cane frontman Damon Johnson and ex-Virgos Merlot guitarists Jason Marchant and Deacon Ledbetter combine to create a solid blend of earnest sincerity and old school rock attitude on Dead Man's Vitamin. Johnson's world-weary, yet melodic vocals are contemplative and burning on the reflective ""Gun To My Head"" and the quasi-psychedelic ""Ballad Of The Lost."" In contrast, Marchant and Leadbetter's gutbucket riffage raises the stoner anthem ""Amphetamine"" and the almost Motley Crue sounding ""Why Fight It"" to fist pumping heights not heard since the heyday of G'N'R. Think of it as 90's rock with a jolt of 80's swagger for good measure."
5,EVERY CHRISTIAN SHOULD HAVE THIS BOOK!,"Wow where do I begin?! This book has been a true God send! I didn't even know I was dealing with the Jezebel spirit until I read this book! It truly is an eye-opener. It is has very specific details and characteristic traits of someone operating as Jezebel.So make sure you confess the character traits you see operating in yourself before you look at someone else and ask God to take stuff out of you! But this spirit of Jezebel is in many churches in the Body of Christ and it must be confronted! Too many people are fearful of confronting Jezebel and that has enlarged her power in today's churches! I don't understand how people can confront sin before they got saved, yet after being saved get timid! If you are dealing with this spirit of control in your church,place of employment, in your friendships and/or in your family you need to get this book and apply it!"
3,Title should be changed but good book,This book was very insightful for identifying a Jezebel character. I was disappointed that the focus of the book is identification of the problem and not a step by step how to deal with it.
5,This book exposes the false leaders that hold people captive,The exposure from this book has revealed some of my own hidden agendas as well that of others which has keep me held back from God's best for me.Thanks Pastor Sampson
5,Pure joy! A science writing masterpiece.,"If you read only one science book this year, it has to be James Shreeve's inside view of the race to sequence the human genome. The story of this tumultuous competition between the prestigious Human Genome Project and the brash visionary Craig Venter is a joy ride. Shreeve's irreverent, charming and ultimately thrilling tale is a masterpiece of science writing. The white coats (and white hats) drop away in this book as Shreeve reveals the majesty of science for what it has always been, a very human story. Bravo!"
5,One big flaw: lack of art,"This is a wonderful book. James Shreeve was granted incredible access and became an eye witness to history.My only criticism - of the publisher, not Shreeve - is the complete absence of art. There's not a single photo, not a single illustration, not a single diagram, chart or anything else to illustrate the book. This is a serious failing in a book about personalities - people. Wonder what Craig Venter looks like? You won't find out here. How about Francis Collins, Michael Hunkapiller or Tony White? Sorry. It's a pity Shreeve didn't carry a camera as well as a notepad as he followed Venter and witnessed events which will become mythic with the passage of time. Shreeve is masterful in his craft, particularly his use of metaphors to simply and clearly describe complex biological concepts, but this can't excuse the utter absence of documentary photographs for what may well become THE history of the human genome. This is simply incomprehensible."
1,Extended Versions... not exactly.,"I was disappointed to find that the title of this album was misleading (probably not by accident). These are not extended studio-versions, but all live-, or acousic-versions of songs that have already been released on previous albums. If you are looking for a more complete collection of songs by The Fixx (and already have their other albums), ""Extended Versions"" will give you nothing new."
4,Nice for the price,"Having very little exposure to The Fixx other than their hits on various 80's collections, I figured I'd drop the [$] for this one and give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised. One of the better acoustic albums I've heard... Worth consideration for those new to The Fixx."
5,Tony is the best,I remember Tony back when he used to work at Downtown records in NYC..I was a big fan of him when he was part of the Latin Rascals & I'm still a fan..I'm glad he's still doing his thing 20 + years later.. I love this cd!!! Keep them coming Tony!!!
5,Great Compilation!,"OMG, this is one hot cd! The original track by Tony and Deborah Cooper ""Live You All Over"" is going to be this years biggest anthem. Also, this cd has new mixes of Deborah Cox's ""Easy as Life"" and Reina's ""If I Close My Eyes"". All in all, a great cd that feels like a night at the club."
2,Not Tony Moran's Best Work.,"Tony Moran is a master at his craft, however, this is not a good example of it. From beginning to end it's the same--nothing stands out. I guess I was expecting more."
1,This CD Sucks.,"No way...don't believe the past reviews. Electronica music and evolved wayyyyy past the days of sirens and whistles. Gone are the days of glow sticks and other rave toys. Perhaps 5 or 6 yeas ago this CD would have been a hit...but those days have come and gone. For some truly original work check out Sander Kleinenberg, Saeed & Palash or some of the other artists that I have reviewed. Tony Moran takes you back to the days of Soundfactory (NY), or Liquid (MIA)...but those days are over. It's time to progress."
2,Those who rate above 3 probably did not read through,"The structure is good, topics are comprehensive, style is concise.The problems,The book seems did not proof read carefully. There are many typos, very confusing.Especially in the second part, which is about technical analysis, it does not explain details when they are needed. And it lacks proper explanations for figures. Some figures do not match patterns he described.This guy, Luca, seems to be famous. He is maybe good at trading himself and he is able to write a good book, but he just did not put himself into it."
5,Cornelius Luca draws upon his years of experience,"Cornelius Luca draws upon his years of experience and expertise with the foreign exchange market and the rapidly evolving financial industry to explain the complex machinations currency markets in Trading In The Global Currency Markets. Now in a fully updated and expanded second edition, the text continues to be practical, informative, clear, concise, and reader friendly, covering every aspect of currency trading including market characteristics, mechanics, trading techniques, forecasting methods, and much more. Whether a beginning student of global financial markets or a seasoned foreign exchange trader, Trading In The Global Currency Markets is highly recommended, essential reading for anyone associated with commercial or investment bank, financial information service, trading corporation, insurance company, or independent day trader."
4,All you need,"This book gives you a complete vision of the world's currency markets, it is very clear until you reach the technical analysis chapters .PD: "" Appendix _A"" is incomplete; the ""Ecuadorian Sucre (ECS)"" does not figure on the list."
1,Great waste,"There is nothing in this book. It's a waste of money and time reading it, and also even if it's free, you should not read it."
5,Extremely informative!,"Mr.Luca has out done himself. I am a 11 year veteran of the futures markets and I have written three book on futures trading. Mr.Luca's book exceeded my expectations. I read it and was completely enlightened at the chain of connections that drive the currency market. His technical analysis on forex trading was easily adaptable to my own strategies, plus I learned a few new tricks.Mr.Luca's writing is very indepth and many beginners to forex trading will find a lot of information to wade through in order to find the nuggets they are looking for. That being said, any serious beginner will not have a problem with getting a thorough education in this fascinating subject.Intermediate traders will see there mistakes and hopefully correct them by using this book.Overall, this is a great book by Mr.Luca and I keep a copy as a refernce."
5,Trading in the Global Currency Markets,"Loved Trading in the Global Currency Markets! While I only used it to brush up my FX knowldege, I had all my 5 FX traders read it to prepare them for this fast currency market. The book gives you everything you need, and then some. It's a very methodical book, leaving no stone unturned. It's also very objective. All other books on FX or technical analysis have ""an angle"". Not Luca's. In his book, he presents all facets of the industry. You just need to choose what's best for you."
2,WHY PUFFY WHY,"Bad Boy did a horrible job with this album. There are some good songs (maybe 2-3), but over all this album is wack!"
1,WTF IS WRONG WITH P DIDDY???,"Why is P Diddy tryin to make money off of Notorious BIG. Is P Diddy just jealous because he has no talent at rapping? Seems like it, if Notorious BIG was still alive this is not how he'd want his music to be. I don't know whats up with all the guest appearances that just totally ruins Biggies music. I think P Diddy needs to just let Notorious BIG rest in peace, and let his music carry on as a legend by itself. If you think this is good music by Notorious BIG then your like the rest of the people today that think all the new stuff is good. All the new rappers are just copying off all the old rap. Rap will one day die and its ashame, but its over played and has nothing new. For any Biggie fan I wouldn't waste your money on this cd. Stick with his first two cds. Shame on P Diddy for ruining a legends material.F U DIDDY!!!"
1,How come I can't load the cd in my iPod???!!!,"I tried to be honest and I bought the cd just to find out that it has a security so that you can't use it in your computer!!!So if you plan (as I did...) to load it in your iPod, forget it: rip it from the internet, and you get the money in your pocket and the music in your iPod!!!"
3,Biggie's Last Album Ends Up Very Limited,"Biggie's last hiphop album ends up missing a beat in this direction. I heard more special guest appearances then Biggie himself. I though some of the beats for Biggie's tracks was less hardcore, and speaking of hardcore where in the heck was Lil Kim in this project??? Of course, the club hit produced by Jazzy Pha ""Nasty Girl"" sounded so much like an older Biggie joint. I also liked ""Ultimate Rush"" with Missy. ""1970 Somethin'"" with Game and Faith was tight. ""Spit Your Game"" was a crazy track as well. And, plus ""Living the Life"" with Luda, Faith, and Bobby V., was real nice too."
2,Almost worse than Born Again,"I should play ""Juicy"" and rap during the chorus. Then I could release it as a single: The Notorious B.I.G. featuring Al, ""All a Dream"". That would be no different than the majority of songs on this album, cut and pasted Biggie verses over new beats with the titles altered and new guest stars. While three songs are hot (""1970 Something"", ""Just a Memory"", ""Living in Pain""), you're better off downloading those tracks and sticking with your Ready to Die tape and Life After Death CD."
2,"2 stars, because it's B.I.G....","I didn't think it was possible, but I've lost even more respect for Sean Puffy P. Diddy Daddy Combs. This album is nearly a complete disgrace.The guest artists suck, with the exception of Mobb Deep, Krayzie, Nas, and the posthumous exceptions of Pun, Marley, and 'Pac.The production, excluding ""Hold Ya Head,"" is terrible. All this CD does is make you want to listen to B.I.G. flow over the original track. Even the few guests I mentioned earlier can't save this LP from being a disaster.Don't buy this album. ""Hold Ya Head"" is the only above-average song on the whole thing, and it's not worth it to spend $15 for that one song. Download ""Hold Ya Head,"" and get some Ready To Die and Life After Death if you don't already have them. Heck, I'd get Born Again before I bought this album.Hopefully, after this failure, the title's right, and this is the final chapter in B.I.G.'s posthumous albums(which there are only two of, but still, it's two too many)."
1,"Diddy, Let Biggie RIP","I believe Puffy/Diddy even bothered to go through with this. These songa are not duets. All he did was remix old Biggie material and add newly recorded verses and choruses from today's artists. Now, some people may find this as a tribute album but I think Sean Combs is just trying to profit off of his late friend. Just Let BIG rest in peace. If anything new does happen from Notorious BIG, here's what I can imagineA. A biography book or dvdB. A biggie movieC. A Music video dvd collectionD. A chopped and screwed BIG albumBut please, let this be the final chapter and let BIG rest in peace"
1,Duets The Final Chapter,I obtained this for a friend.I played this cd once and found the content to be disturbing particularly the frequent bad language.he biggest load of crap I have ever encountered
3,Alright tracks,"Notorious BIG Final Chapter Duets, is a pretty good album if you ask me. I like almost every song on the disc, mostly ""Spit Your Game"" and ""Im Wit Whatever"". I think it was a really well done album by Bad Boy Records. Anyway's it's a pretty good tribute Cd, plus mine came with a free DVD, explaining everything about Biggie and his death, with exclusive music video's."
2,puffy's money album,"this cd isn't that great. just about all of B.I.G.'s raps are recycled. Just a couple of songs that have new verses. Whatchu want is the only track stands out. Spit you game, it pretty much a sad remake (my opinion) of notorious thugs ft. bone. and the other is.. it has been said and it doesnt have B.I.G. in it at all. use caution if you think about buying this album"
4,DON'T LET BAD REVIEWS OR DIDDY HATRED SWAY YOU!,"1ST OF ALL WE ALL KNOW B.I.G. IS GONE & IF HE WAS ALIVE CHANCES ARE HE WOULDN'T DO A SONG WITH SOME OF THESE ARTISTS (MAYBE, HE DID AFTER ALL DO A SONG WITH SHAQ!) THAT BEING SAID THIS IS A FAR BETTER CD THAN BORN AGAIN. UNFORTUNATELY BIG DIDN'T LEAVE ALOT OF MATERIAL SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE WHAT YOU CAN GET * BUT PUT BIGGIE'S LYRICS AGAINST ANY SO-CALLED HOT RAPPER OUT NOW & B.I.G. STILL CRUSHES THEM ALL!!!!!!!! THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY B.I.G. FAN OR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO HEAR REAL TALENT & LYRICS SOOOOO...DON'T LET THE FACT THAT YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE DIDDY KEEP YOU FROM SUPPORTING B.I.G. AT LEAST IT'S NOT LAFFY TAFFY!!!"
4,THAT'S WHY B.I.G. WAS THE BEST EVER !!!,"Puff, you did a great job !!! Mixing the old verses and new stuff, w/catchy melodies !!! As always, it seems that B.I.G is telling a story, and you can't help but get caught up in it !!! It was great that so many artists and friends, wanted to be a part of the tribute. Ultimate Rush, Living the Life, and 1970 Something are definite favorites.If Duets is indeed the Final Chapter, His legacy is indeed left intact, and B.I.G is smiling down !!!"
5,hot album,this album is off the chain. All the tracks are hot to me. Even the interlude is hot also.
5,This Album Is So Sick,"This album is so tight every rapper that is tight has this album and if you dont got this album then something is wrong with you cuz this is the hottest album of the year and probably the best album that he has made after he has passed away. The album is tight and the DVD is nice, if you dont have this album you need to get it cuz every song on this album is nice. This would be one CD that you listen to the whole CD and like every song on it"
4,Great album but not as good as desired from fans,"The fourth LP from the Notorious B.I.G is the best rap album to come out in a long time. This album contains about 6 new verses, while the rest of the tracks are laced with remastered and reconfigured verses from previous published recordings. tracks like watchu want featuring jay-z, living in pain featuring 2pac, mary j blige, and nas, and breaking old habits with T.I and slim thug carry this album. Eminem and obie trice tear up the cd with the song It has been said, which curiously doesnt feature the king of new york himself. another track not featuring biggie is I'm with whateve featuring jim jones, lil wayne, and juelz santana. all and all i feel that this venture by the didster could have been much much better. In a world where rap has done gone down the tubes as of recent this cd is a perfect solution to those who feel deprived of good music."
4,The Final Chapter,"The Notorious BIG's supposed final album has it's good points and bad points. Overall, I would say yes this is a good album. It's definitely no 'Ready to Die' but this is a different time and a different album so why compare it to the past? Lots of guest appearances on this album as was expected and alot of them do very well in contributing to this Biggie album. My favorite colabo on here would have to be ""Hold Ya Head"" with Biggie joined by Bob Marley, one of the best songs on the album in my opinion. Other appearances made include: Diddy(of course), Faith Evans, Slim Thug, TI, Bone Thugs, Juelz Santana, 2Pac, Jay Z, and Nas to name a few. Biggie's mother also provides her words for the outro which was very nice to hear. I think this was a great album to solidify BIG's greatness in the rap game and he will always be remembered."
3,"Biggie's Ready To Die, but Puff won't let him","A lot of my friends always ask why I am critical of P. Diddy; this album summarizes my thoughts perfectly. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Biggie, but his legacy continues to be watery as bar drinks, staring with that joke album ""Born Again"" five years ago. At least on that album(and in post-mortem 2Pac albums), there was actually some NEW material,; these cut-and-paste job ""production"" by Mr.Diddy is shameful. Hopefully, this will be the last entry in the chapter Of The Notorious B.I.G, andthat Puff will let his friend's music be(don't bet on it)."
5,Biggie Duets Cd,"This cd is the best cd out there right now. A lot of other albums have maybe 2 or 3 songs that are good, but i would have to say that about 12 of the songs on this cd have become my favorite, and the rest are all still amazing, its not like those are the only 12 songs that are good, but all of them are. A lot of good artists are on it, and it is definitely worth the money, if not, then its a steal. Biggie, Akon, Missie, Eminem, Jay-Z, Twista, Faith, the list goes on. You should definitely pick this one if you don't know which cd you want to buy. The Final Chapter is simply sik"
3,my honest opinion,"i personally think diddy did a good job, at least as good as born again. i was confused at tracks like it has been said and im with whateva to begin with since they dont reature any biggie raps, but i like them now. the first half of the album is better with whatchu want featuring some vocals i never heard before. one thing that got on my nerves was the unimaginatively chosen verses. surely they could have used his verses on you to be happy, 4 my n*ggaz or c!nt renaissance and others, rather than well known verses from his 2 proper albums, which everyone who bought this probably already has. its still interesting to hear old songs remixed though, and about half of them are fire. if youre a big fan desperate for more, then obviopusly you have to buy this but i think they should have cut 3 or 4 tracks to make it sharper."
4,Oh Snaps This The CD Right Here,"Yo Bad Boys did there thing on this album but the reason I gave it a 4 star is because I got 1 question ""WHAT TOOK SO LONG"". I loved this CD, This album is crazy, they got some hits up in here. The next single should be either ""Mi Casa"" or ""Whatchu Want"". All Biggie fans should get this album. R.I.P. BIG!"
2,The Final Chapter is a dissappointing one.,"Notorious B.I.G's posthumous final album, Duets: The Final Chapter that I'm sorry to say it's a dissappoinment in every way, I Have great respect for P. Diddy and Voletta wallace, but this album is confused and totally unfocused, although there are so good songs on there especially the Bob Marley/Biggie song, but the rest is just a major drift and it doesn't even decided how good the rest of the album is.Although this is not as bad as another posthumous rapper's album(2Pac's Loyal to the game was even worse than this one), but this is still not enough."
2,Pretty Bad...even for a B.I.G. CD,"Diddy might have taken his time in getting every big rapper and producer onto one album as a tribute to the late Notorious B.I.G....but that doesn't mean he took his time in regards to the quality of the album. The guest spots feel insanely forced, especially the single with Nelly and Jagged Edge. Not a good song! ""Spit Your Game"" with Twista and Krayzie Bone is a rehash of a much better song called ""Notorious Thugs,"" although Krayzie does rip his verse.Overall, about as low as the ""newest albums from dead rappers"" trend can get, do not buy this album. Save some money and buy something you really want."
5,B.I.G,Yo mane this CD is hot yo tha duets on here are so clean its like they were meant to be. When I heard this CD it made me wanna change my life.
1,disrespectful,"this was terrible, i only gave 1 star cause u can't give zero. worst choices for guest appearances, people BIG never would've worked with and every beat was unlistenable too. Every biggie verse was off=beat and poorly remixed. The only tollerable tracks was What You Want cause it lacked a bad guest performer, even though this track wa also very poorly remixed over a beat that didn't fit w/ big's vocals. if u're a Biggie fan, stay away from this cd, if u're a fan of whack mixtape sounding albums like Loyal To The Game or anything put out by GUnit, Eminem, Kanye, etc. then go ahead bump it up, but thaz cause you're a friggen retard hahaha...boycott this album."
2,"Rating is low because of production, otherwise i'd up it another star","I just got this album and I gotta say, its not bad. I didn't really know what to expect, except that gay daddy was behind it. Like the other reviews on here say, there are no new verses by big poppa. Although I am a strict 2pac fan, I respect B.I.G. for the rapper he was. The production is alright, verses from fellow rappers are alright, so therefore, this album was alright. Best songs on the album are living in pain, ultimate rush, and mi casa (not because of r kelz, but because of the verses biggie spits). If you wanna cop one of the best albums of 2005, get Carter II by Lil Wayne."
2,Diddy please stop !!!,"Being a huge Biggie fan I rushed out and picked it up the day it came out. I was somewhat disappointed after listening to the whole album a few times. This is the same old raps played out to different beats and choruses. Just Diddy trying to make some more money off the only good artist on the bad boy label. I was even disgusted listening to Diddy on track #2 talk about how he took BIG from coal to diamonds, molded his mind, and calls him his frankenstein like Diddy was the mastermind behind the success of the Notorious one. Anyone who knows anything about rap is laughing at Diddy right now. BIG's flows were incredible and would have been hits over any beat chosen. If you are a true Biggy fan, get Ready to Die and Life After, stay away from this one. Diddy please stop digging up Biggy every couple of years. Stick to making your terrible bands on MTV and leave the legend alone."
2,B.I.G. Mistake.,"Why have people played with Biggie Smalls' music? This album is a pathetic attempt to revive his legendary music.THE ONLY GOOD SONG IS ""1970 Somethin'""!The collaborations are below par, and do not deserve to be put under B.I.G.'s name. Pathetic. Download ""1970 Somethin'"" and you have the best of this album."
2,fluffy Puffy back to Milking off Biggie,"I always dug Biggie as a story-teller&felt His vibe. Biggie was cold on the Mic&He was something else for a Minute.had to give Him dap to tolerate&put up with Puffy.Puffy is back to Milking off Biggie.alot of take or leave cuts.the first single truly stanks. Puffy can't create no hits no more,but then again he never did in the first place,but that's another time&topic,but here at hand is a Album which was basically thrown&tossed together to generate some Holiday Buzz. I just want the Biggie Greatest Hits package&then Puffy should leave it alone."
2,Tricky......,"Diddy does what he does best, and thats making money. BIG only had 2 albums in his short career. In my opinion, one stellar album. ""Life after Death"" a two disc postuhumos LP, could have been shorten to one disc to be satsifactory. This is basically worse than ""Born Again"" This is another wasted album, with a lotof guest appearences, you can read them. Of course, they rhyme and its good. But you heard these verses before. Highlights: ""Hold ya head"" with Bob Marley ""1970 somethin"" with Faith Evans & The Game""Running your mouth"" true brooklyn track download it."
4,"Worth it for the track ""Living in Pain""","There are a lot of haters reviewing right now. These people really don't know what they are talking about. I have NEVER written an amazon review before, but I was forced to in this case. The track ""living in pain"" featuring pac, nas, and mjb is amazing and is alone worth the $12 this cd costs. Nas spits some wisdom on his verse (some crazy stuff about bloods being in the LAPD. Now this is crazy becuase of the well known rumor about suge hiring bloods he knew in the LAPD to kill biggie). The rest of the CD sound's good, it's very polished (which may or may not be a good thing). This cd is in a similiar format as biggie's ""life after death."" The people hating on this cd would say the same thing about biggie's ""life after death."" If you like that cd you'll probably like this cd."
1,Same Old Stuff,"Everyone has already heard all of these lyrics before there is no point to making this cd, other than Puffy being puffy reproducing old lyrics to make a new cd to get more money from a struggiling bad boys companyThe instrumentals are weak andI think puffy is losing his mind by making the Legend B.I.G. colaborating with some wack rappers on here he even has korn on here??????????This is not a Biggie cd to get get all of the others though"
1,The Best with the Worst,"The Notorious B.I.G. is one of the greatest emcee's of all time, and his first two albums are classics. But this so called Duets album is a joke. Sean Diddy Combs has dragged Biggies name through the mud once again. This album is nothing but recycled rhymes put to some of the weakest beats I've ever heard. One of the best emcees teamed up with some of the worst rappers that have ever picked up a mic. For exampe: Nelly, Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, The Game, Diddy, Lil' Wayne, Dipset, T.I. ect. Forget it, the whole line up is wack. Beats, artists, and concecpt is garbage. Diddy should burn in hell for puttin' this together. Please pick up Ready to Die, or Life After Death. Die Diddy, please. You killed hip-hop."
4,"Great album, it will keep you rockin' all night!","The Kudzu Kings are definitely on the right track with this CD. Perfect for a little change of pace. I highly recommend seeing them live ""down in Mississippi"""
2,Overcooked Omelette.,"Like an overcooked omelette this work is just to dense to digest. Some really valuable insights made too hard to find amid brain-numbingphilosophizing . I read it thru and I""m sorry I did."
2,Doing away with Authors,"Mr. Greenblatt's theories continue an academic tradition of discounting the individual work of the writer by forcing historical context over text, treating the writer of a creative work as mere vessel. What happened to the individual reader encoutering the writer via the work of art? Of course, this common sense approach would cut short a lot of pedantic careers, and that is what Critical Theory is all about: it allows pedants to have a job."
3,pretty good. Very long lasting.,Very very long lasting. Sound is alright. I've heard better.Will perhaps try for some earnie ball strings next time. :)
5,The BEST strings ever!,The first time I played my Mandolin the sound was not good. It was not a pleasure to play so I replaced the strings with D'Addario. I was pleasantly surprised. The tone was so sweet and the strings were so easy to play. I'll never buy any other brand. What a SWEET sound!
4,How much for the whole box??,each package has 1 set of 8 strings right? What if i want to buy a whole box of sets of Mandolin Nickel Strings??? How much is it? How many sets has the box? what's the size? I don't want bronze strings by the way.
2,Overpowering smell,"Lily of the Valley is my favorite scent, but this product smells nothing like it. Even if the package had not arrived with one bottle broken and the package saturated, I would have requested a refund rather than a replacement. Very disappointing quality."
3,complicated and grim,"There are a lot of characters in this story which covers three generations. I think its three. The names are confusing and to really follow the lives of the characters, either keep a family tree of your own or keep referring to the one at the beginning of the book. Or do as I did and just read on and lose track of who married whom and who their children are. The story covers some horrific times in China's history, and by involving nine siblings, the author can cover just about every possibility in those times from misguided marriages to prostitution, selling children, starvation, murder, narrow escapes, cruelty. indifference, and some kindness. I wish that I had read one of this authors other books instead of this one because so many pages of these people's difficulties is a long haul. Yet if you can figure out the factions and know the time periods, it is informative."
1,Not what I expected,"I was given this book by a friend who knows I am passionate about East Asia and, having won the Nobel Prize, my friend knew I was curious about Mo Yan's literature. What to say. Although I like some of the descriptions, the book drudges on and on about wars and poking holes through a frozen lake and breasts... I like breasts don't get me wrong, I just don't care for this book. I find it hard to keep focused on it even for just one chapter, and I'm a rather avid reader."
4,Big Breasts and Wide Hips by Mo Yan,"I bought this book after the author won the Nobel prize for literature.I like slice of life books, and I felt this book gave an accurate portrayal of the context of life in China at the time. Additionally I felt that the characters were mostly true to character, and there were enough elements of surprise to keep me interested and engaged with the book.I'd recommend it for anyone who is interested in China, or who enjoys slice of life books."
1,hated it,Loathed logging along through misery after misery. War forever. Crudeness of the characters beyond measure. Most of my book club didn't manage to finish it. I did learn something but would have happily gone without.
2,self-conscious,Read sample. Overly self-conscious. Dense words crowd out reader. Too many characters with odd names/references make the reader work harder than she needs to.
3,natural stress relief,"if this relieved my stress, it was very, very little. i might have listened to all the songs one time each."
5,Relaxing,Stress Relief is very relaxing. I especially like the Inner Sea as I imagine lying on a beach somewhere and its like you can almost feel the sun!
5,Excellent for a Relaxing Massage,"This cd is a treasure in my music collection for massage therapy treatments. I've gotten lots of positive feedback from clients. Truly beautiful, flowing melodies."
2,Could Hardly Finish It!,"I love futuristic books but I found this one so boring that I could hardly finish. I know that this is the first book in a series of 5 but it was so slow moving & the characters weren't all that great. I've read a couple other of Susan Grant's books & didn't find them very good either. I'm an avid reader & the really good books grab you from the beginning & draw you into the story with the characters, plot, action & love scenes. Susan Grant's books fail to do so & I would rate her a mediocre writer."
4,Book One of a fabulous new series...,"Shot down over enemy territory, Bree ""Banzai"" Maguire is placed in stasis for one hundred and seventy years, waking to find herself in a new world. Everyone she knew is dead and the world is totally different. She is now a legend, kept as an honored guest by Prince Kyber, the ruler of Asia. Or is she a prisoner? Although Kyber is attractive, it's another man who wins Bree's heart. Ty Armstrong has dreamed of Banzai since he was a boy. Rescuing her and joining her cause seems only natural. However, Kyber might not agree.**** The premise of this series has been used before, but never has its execution seemed so logical or possible. It is easy to imagine the world becoming as pictured in this new series. The love triangle has just enough tension, and there is a fair amount of action to keep the pace moving. ****"
5,WOW!,"Mama, this is not the same Romance anymore. This book is more adventure. There is romance, but it takes backseat to some high-flying adventure. This is outstanding writing. You feel like you are in to cockpit and the g-force is hitting you write along with the character Banzai. Her nickname, real name Bree Maguire. She is high-flying pilot in a U.N. Peacekeeper force over troubled Korea. Starts out in the future 2 years from now, and then jumps to the year 2176, and the face of the world is much different.It's a super story, that grabbed me and keep me turning page after page. So if you are looking for a tale that is fresh, that will carry you into a wild adventure then Banzai is your cup of tea."
3,eh.,"While I've enjoyed books she's written in the past.. this one.. kinda irritated me.One mediocre love scene with the hero and the back pages being inelegant spoilers as to what happened to Bonzai's fallen comrade.I think this had the potential to be one of her better books, but it just feels like it stops somewhere in the middle of the second act of a 3 act play."
2,"If you can handle the bad sound, give it a go!","I adore Caterina Valente, and I truly feel that she is one of the most gifted musicians of this century. Unfortunately, I was born too late to hear her in the 60s, so it's interesting to hear this archive. However, it sounds as if it was recorded with someone's portable 60s reel-to-reel, with a mic sitting somewhere next to a martini glass. Stereo? Forget it. Miss Valente's live performances are better documented on the Bear Family box sets--which are worth every penny."
5,"Gorgeous, luscious, jazz clarinet","I saw Harry live in concert with his quartet, and was stunned. It was one of the best concerts I've ever seen in my life. This album makes me want to learn how to play clarinet. I especially like the title track, which is the last on the disk. I have both his albums, and wish he'd record more. The only sad note in the whole process is that Ed Saindon, the vibraphonist on both Harry's albums and at the concert I saw, has left to start his own band. They're both so much better with the other around that I wish they'd get back together. That's life, I guess. Buy this album."
4,Ladybug S & P Shakers,The Ladybug Salt and Pepper Shakers were great. They were painted with good detail. Thanks
5,Very cute,These little things are the cutest salt and pepper shakers I have ever seen. Very good product at a very good price.
4,Great read,The book was quick read and great for my on-line class. Also great resource if you want to know America's history. The only problem I had with it was the mechanics of it. It was difficult opening book in early chapters because the seam was sewn so tight that the pages pulled out when I opened it wider to read.
3,Clashes of Will,The book arrived in a timely manner. The book was in really bad shape. A lot worse than one was led to believe. I was pretty disappointed.
4,A good overview of XSI,"If you are a new or an intermediate user of Softimage/XSI, you will find a lot of good, useful information in this book. This book is a general, high-level overview of the core features of XSI, accompanied by tutorials covering most of those features. Although I am very familiar with most of the information presented, there were still enough tidbits of cool info to make the book worth the price for me.If you are an advanced user - or looking to examine any of XSI's features in depth, however, you will probably be disappointed. A number of the exercises and tutorials come from the older Mesmer XSI series of books (also by Mr Rossano)- which have been updated to be compatible with V5."
4,Lot's of information for beginners...,"... but i should have been told that this book is the latest ""xsi illuminated"" book. since mesmer.com is no more, there's a need for publishing this manual on other channels. it's pretty decent, but if you already own a mesmer ""xsi illuminated"" book... you'll probably don't need this one. i've got the v2.0 version of mesmer's book and all what's new in this one is hair and rigid bodies... hmmm, too sad rossano is still happy with the old soft-keysetting and behavior of the old si3d. xsi settings just rock and you can handle the whole app pretty fast! lot's of new or renew tutorials, especially for beginners of xsi a must!!! ...ah! one more thing, i was missing arima-san. his ""toro the happy tuna"" was changed to ""toro the ravenous""...anyway, have fun with xsi!!!"
1,Uncorrected OCR scan--unacceptable,"Unacceptable. This ""e-book"" consists of uncorrected OCR scans of a printed edition. There are no page breaks, all paragraphs are centered, page numbers are embedded in the text.Billings is an American classic in the tradition of Mark Twain and Will Rogers. If you don't know his hilarious writings, you are in for a treat. But find a better edition."
4,EBC Brakes GD7116 GD Series Front Sport Rotor Kit -2,I bought these for a 2006 Honda Accord V6-Automatic. They are replacements for the original front discs which were causing my car to shake when braking from high speed. After replacing the front discs the shaking of the car stopped. Make sure to get a Phillip head impact wrench to remove the 2 screws that hold the disc in place. It would make it a lot easier to remove the old discs with the impact wrench. Also get new Phillip screw from a Honda dealer to replace the ones that are removed since the old screws will be probably be unusable. Good replacement disc for Honda Accord.
3,Habanera!,"I bought this DVD because I wanted the complete opera of 'Carmen'. I expected the centerpiece of this great work-the HABANERA, to be outstanding. I was sorely disappointed-the HABANERA was mediocre at best. I have a movie, ONE NIGHT OF LOVE, starring the greatest soprano ever, beautiful MISS GRACE MOORE, where she performs the HABANERA with all the perfection one could possibly desire! Anna Caterina Antonacci, who performed in the item I purchased from you could take a cue from that long ago performance by GRACE!Best Regards, Charlie"
4,Totally moved,"I first heard KT on a Christmas album, got me curious.. This album covers just about everything. The voice is so smooth..My favorites are Look to the Rainbow and the complete opposite, Blue Grass. This woman has the range and style to totally move me."
1,"Pick a breaker, any breaker","I purchased this item at a local dealer because I needed it *now*, but all should benefit from my knowledge. Two units ""work"" exactly the same: if you want to know within 6 to 8 breakers which one is the target, this baby will do the job. If you have the expectation of locating the *exact* breaker, just start turning off breakers like you always have done, because you will not find the target with this little jewel. Save your money or buy something else."
3,Works adequately,"It seems like you have to experiment a bit to find the best way to orient the wand for maximum response (maybe it even varies by the brand of breaker box and breakers). For me it seemed to work best when the tip of the wand was parallel with the outer edge of the breaker. When you do find the ""right"" breaker you'll get both the tone (not to be confused with the ever-present 60Hz buzz) and the top red light is illuminated. Sometimes it seems like I get a ""tie"" -- pick one, open it, if the tone doesn't stop, it's the other one. Even under the worst of conditions where you can't decide, it's still somewhat handy, since flipping breakers one a time until the tone stops still beats flipping a breaker and jogging to some other part of the house to see if you got the right one."
1,No Good,"I bought this from a mail order catalog and couldn't wait to try it out. My high expectations were quickly dashed, as the unit beeped and indicated 6 breakers as to being the correct one to shut off. I finally started shutting off the breakers one by one and none of the 6 were it.Needless to say, it was returned right away."
1,Wind deflector,It did not secure to wear-stand the wind and last a long time.IN ADDITION TO THE TAPE IT PROBABLE NEEDED SOME CLIPS AS WELL FOR BETTER SECURITY.
1,Returned,"I returned this item because it had a piece of masking tape holding the double sided tape in place. From the vendor! The product appeared flimsy as well and was too long for my particular application. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra bucks for a good one.Auto Ventshade 77003 Windflector 35.5"" Sunroof Wind Deflector"
3,subtitles do not matter,the reviewers often devaluate a video if it has subtitles in english. i think this only concerns lazy anglophones.
5,A book that rekindles fond memories of beloved past pets.,"When I was fourteen years old my best friend, Tina (my faithful collie) died and I felt the first awful stirrings of grief. Night after night I laid on her favorite old rug crying, engulfed in loneliness and sorrow at her passing. To me it was the end of the world and no amount of comforting by my parents or friends could ease the pain. She had been my faithful companion, and since I was an only child she was in many ways my sister. As I grew older the grief subsided but the all of the lovely memories did not. When I read ""A Cat's Life, Dulcy's Story"" by Dee Ready, I knew there existed at least one more person on earth ( and one more pet in heaven!) who felt EXACTLY as I did. It made no difference that Dulcy was a cat and Tina was a dog; they were the same in spirit to each of us. This book is a must read for anyone who has ever loved or been loved by an animal soul mate."
4,"English Woman, Montana Man and some busybodies to boot","This could be a comedy of errors. People being caught in all sorts of not-good-lookin' situations. Strong characters, near misses, wrong impressions, righteous looking trouble makers, ohhh all the right ingredients for a lovely romance novel!!"
5,Wonderful read!,"Determined not to marry a man she didn't love, Lady Elizabeth Wellington jumps a ship to America to run away from a marriage which her recently deceased father had arranged. Her lone friend in America is her young pen pal, Janie Garrett, in New Prospects, Montana. Remembering that Janie had recently said the town needed a new school teacher, Lady Elizabeth travels to New Prospects and applies for the job. The town's wealthy banker, Owen Simpson, immediately falls in love with Lady Elizabeth. She, however, has her eye on the widowed father of young Janie. Fast and enjoyable read. Get all your chores done, sit out on the swing, and lose yourself in New Prospects, Montana and love."
4,Dear Lady,"interesting, and a good reading book, which will keep your interest, it's also a'feel good ' book, which is the kind I like to read"
5,Nancy was from Virginia & taught England how to live large,"A wonderful life story about the woman who helped us all know how to live life at the top. What style, what grace, what spunk - I simply adore her & this was the first book that introduced her to the world. I am traveling to England to tour her homes in 2 weeks & re-read this again along with the other books on her life."
3,Could've been better.,"This was in my opinion the worst of the Ohio Players recording of the 70's decade. Yet, I still give it a 3 rating just on the strength of being a fan and how good there band is in terms of the great musicianship that they display. There are actually only two good songs on this whole album. You can tell that they are bout at a decline stage at this point. But the follow up album to this one is definitely better. The title of it is ""Jass-Ay-Lay-Dee"". If you are a fan of this group, you definitely want to cop that one. It's pretty good."
4,Very good,I purchased Cartoon Network Dare Off Duos Billy And Bloo came in perfect everything is shown how it is good.
3,Spiral Realms - 'Crystal Jungle Of Enos' (Cleopatra) 3 1/2 stars,"Spiral Realms is violinist Simon House's ambient/electronic space rock project of the '90's.Nice follow-up to the 'A Trip To G9' disc(see my review).Not one of my favorite CD's of the last ten or so years,but if you enjoy the two genres I mention in the first line of this review,you should get something out of this release.Tunes I was most impressed with were ""Solar Wind"",the eight-minute soaring ""Sands Of Mars"",the title cut ""Crystal Jungle Of Enos"" and ""Ice Raiders Of Charon"".Also check out the Simon House/Rod Goodway-'House Of Dreams' import disc."
5,SPACE AMBIENCE,"Just float away to the crystal jungles of Eos, the sands of Mars, intesting ambient, you won't find better!"
4,Vallejo Rocks!,"Great CD! Get to see Vallejo all the time here in Austin and they are an excelletn live band. Also, check out their latest CD...STEREO!"
4,Good fenders for a FS MTB,"I'm becoming a fan of Planet Bike Products. This is the 3rd item of theirs that I have purchased recently, and they all have worked well.My Kona Dawg full suspension MTB has a rear four bar linkage that makes mounting a rear fender a problem. The trick is to have the rear fender be able to move in relation to one of the mount points, a problem that Planet Bike solved by supplying a neat sliding mount that allows the fender to move in relation to the swingarm. The downside of this it that it took a lot of fooling around on my part to get the rear fender solidly mounted. I had to add a few extra zip ties and some double sided tape that was not supplied with the kit to secure it solidly.The front fender installed with no throuble using the supplied hardware and is firmly mounted. The mud flats, in my opinion, had to go and luckly they were easy to remove."
5,Awesome,i got these pretty fast in the mail. they were pretty easy to install on my fuji bike. the one problem i had was the front fender tried to rub on the tire so i used the remaining zip ties to prevent this i have rode 25ish miles since i bought them and tested the extensivly hitting every bump i could on the road didnt and they didnt touch the bike once.Great Product
3,Does not fit 29er,"These fenders are fine, and have flexibility in fitting a variety of bikes... but they do not fit a 29er.I thought this should be somewhere in the description... so, I'm just writing it here.I'm exchanging for the Planet Bike Cascadia ... but, I don't think they'll fit because they use eyelets to attach.. which I don't have... nor do most 29ers... arg."
2,"Avoid, unless you have no other option!","I figured these would be better for me because I would like to take my fenders off for some rides. I was wrong, the slick technology advertised is pretty much rubber bands.Fickle, wobbly, unstable... Man, I should have gone with regular fenders. Also, one of the beams broke, so I had to join it back together. Only been used about 5 months of street commuting.In summation, if you have the eyelets for regular fenders; BUY REGULAR FENDERS! Regular fenders are superior, easier to install and are much more durable."
4,Fits my bike,It is adjustable and comes with straps to attach it to the bike. I am happy with the fenders.
2,paid to much,"the product is what I ordered but when I ordered other things with Amazon that amounted over 25.00 I thought I would get free shipping, but I guess this was not included and got ripped off by having the company charging me a huge amount for shipping this small little item, I would not have ordered it in the beginning if I could have found some refills locally, so watch out for the shipping charge and don't be stupid like me."
3,Interesting Smooth Jazz CD,"I really like smooth jazz, but I am conflicted. On the one hand the sacrine sound Kenny G makes me sick, and straight ahead jazz is too diverse and enough not enough groove. Michael Paulo gets it about right, with enough jazz to make it interesting, enough funk to get the groove going, and the typical remake of R&B; classics is always welcome. ""Thats the Way of the World"" is a classic and he does a terrific job on it, except for the last cut when he introduces a rap-hip hop vocal, which strikes me like fingernails across a chalk board.I'm sorry, rap vocals have no part in smooth jazz."
5,One Of The Best Ever.,"There are, at time of this writing, about 100 different versions of the Bach solo violin works in print. Granted, this CD only contains the later 3, but this disc is so good that it leaves you wishing that Hilary had released them all. I don't really even want to comment too much about the performance or wonderful expression of this record: it is a must-own, and you should hear it for yourself... all the more because it is now remastered at mid-price and sounding better than ever.I personally own at least 10 different versions of these complete works, by some of the most renowned violin virtuosos of the recent era- this one rests right along side them easily. In fact, the only one I listen to as much as this one is the Arthur Grumiaux on Philips. Please take my word and snatch this disc up: this one is a sure thing."
5,Beautiful for Adoration,"Very beautifuly written. Nice to have a good variety in novenas. Some for Advent season, or Lent, some for the family, ect. Good for somebody just starting Novena prayers. SHort info on various saints too."
5,Review,"A great book with a lot of novenas, spiritual readings and reflections.A good gift for a catholic friend."
5,everything i hoped for,this little book has a prayer for every occasion and is a pricless purchase. It will help you build a lasting and loving relationship with god.
5,Great sequel to an unexpected family!,I love stockard Channing! I love Christine Ebersole! The royal treat is that you also get a guest spot from Elaine Stritch and RuPaul! If you saw the first one you must by the sequel its well worth the money!
3,Somewhat dated post-war manly amoral adventure,"This movie is typical of the male interest fiction of post WW2, so it is a product of it's time in it's views and attitudes. Most of the American oil exploration crew doesn't realize the gems stolen by the German tank crew are still aboard, but the leader is quite prepared to give them back to the original owner in exchange for oil rights under that khalifa's part of the desert, even though that Bedouin leader gained his wealth from the slave trade. In other words, amorality all around, so know what to expect, even though they throw in a quote from Abe Lincoln for their greedy companion that gives his life in the end for exacerbating the situation in the first place.Flight Of The Phoenix is a better bet for general audiences with a similar theme of desert survival. The tank used appears to be a modified M24 Chaffee, and I'm sure this was shot in the American Southwest."
1,Poorly conceived - lousy organisation,"Very disappointed - the only online review of this book is the overly gushing shlock provided by (...)! The vocab lists seem to be an afterthought, with no consideration regarding parts of speech, gender, number, etc. Very many typos make checking your work an adventure. Frustratingly does not spell out the more complex paradigms, clearly in an effort to conserve space, and therefore money. (eg, ""Doubly Weak Verbs"", p. 91). I am glad to see it is out of print, and hopefully will not be foisted upon unsuspecting students in the future."
1,Another terrible offering from Transit,"This book is terrible, like the other books in the Extreme Fiction Series.The bad grammar, simplistic theology, and nonexistent characterization are all there. Now, however, we're also treated to right-wing propaganda. This ""novel"" is a thinly-veiled brainwashing tool to convince susceptible teens that the separation of church and state is a bad idea, that public schools are evil places, and that only those who follow contemporary American conversative Christianity are good people.Again, the publisher and author should be ashamed. Keep your kids far, far, far away from this drivel. With so much high-quality YA fic on the market that really challenges kids to think, something this absolutely, horrifingly simplistic, condescending, and bad does not even deserve a readership."
2,An Alright Read,This book is just average at best. Pictures of the women interviewed would have helped and often the writers style is just silly and over done. I had high hopes for this book. I was disappointed.
3,A great idea that was well excuted but.....,"I'm a huge fan of Simon Doonan and quite enjoyed the book (particularly the parts about his mother and the wonderful footnotes that he included) but I think that it would have been better minus a few chapters. The women he wrote about were so over the top that after awhile it got a bit wearing and some of them began to grate on my nerves.It might have been nice as well to see different degrees of wackiness, especially since he was pushing the message about emulating these women and encouraging his readers to release their own wackiness. His examples were so extreme that while they made for entertaining reading, they're not people that most of us could in any way relate to.My only other complaint is that he urged readers who hadn't done so to rent the movie Auntie Mame which is a good idea but as a writer he should also have mentioned the book (by Patrick Dennis) that the movie was based on."
2,"Unfortunately, this book with great potential ends up being ""skippable""","While at first glance one would think that this book is a fun pop-culture book destined to one day be a must-read, but ummmm, after a couple chapters where things don't pick up, you realize that this is just a good concept poorly executed by a man who still, even his ""certain age"", has not come to terms with his gender. I'm not talking about his ""orientation"" --that is something he seems to be well comfortable with, I am just saying this man is too envious of the women he writes about. It is almost depressing the way this envy is displayed in an otherwise charming book. He always has and always will want to be a wacky woman. And so he wrote a book about a hand full of women who have lead note-worthy and interesting lives. There is good material and research in Doonan's project,and it would make a HOOT of a film! But the book. . . let's say, with a tad bit of regret, is skippable."
1,Don't waste your Time,"From the other reviews I thought I'd like this book. I can't even finish it (but I'm still trying). I know lots of ""Wacky Chicks"" but they're not as obscene and crass as the ones written about here. Seems you can only be ""wacky"" if you fit into the author's category and there we go again.....putting people into boxes.Honestly, the book was boring and I thought I could have written it better using my own eccentric friends."
1,impressively stupid,"doonana should stick to window dressing, where his talent for his obsession with all things trivial WORKS. as a writer, the king of triviality and stupidity smells terribly rank."
4,Worthwhile introduction to African popular music,"Slightly outdated now, this book is nevertheless a good introduction to the musics of Africa. Unlike the academic or ethnomusicological approaches to the subject by many other titles, ""Africa O-Ye"" has a more popular approach.The book is well laid out and well organised - with plenty colour and black and white photographs and illustrations. Yet it is more than a biography or ""dictionary"" of musicians. It covers the history and context of music in Africa, and then it covers the entire continent, region by region. Within every region, all major popular musical forms are covered, and in these sub-sections, the musicians practising that style are covered. Finally, the book is rounded off with a discography, again organised by region, followed by a bibliography and an index."
3,The last track makes it worth,"This not La Watley's best album. It sounds good, her voice is as velvety as ever, but the whole thing ends up as kind of lame.The jazzy live version of Looking for a new love (Jody's 80s mega hit) makes the CD worth buying though. It's smooth, sexy and fun."
5,Sweet and Gentle Doggy Tales,"All three of my children (4, 2 and 1) love this collection of four episodes. I love it because the stories are so simple and gentle. My two oldest children love chasing butterflies and frogs after watching Kipper do it. My oldest child used to be afraid of the rain, but now he looks foward to finding the rainbows like in the video. I hope more videos are released."
4,"Inspiring, but longer than it needs to be.","I have a love-hate relationship with this book. On the one hand, it inspired a great deal of thought and has really changed the way I look at religious education, and my own job as a religious educator. On the other hand, Groome can be *very* long-winded. This book could have been half as long without sacrificing very much at all.But I have to recommend it -- it is one of the best books about religious education I've ever read."
3,Really only good for one song.,"And that song is ""Me And Mrs. Jones"". The other songs are ok, at best. I'm sure Billy Paul was a talented singer, but somehow, his talent didn't shine through on other songs, like it did ""Me And Mrs. Jones"". I wasn't overly impressed with his version of Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together"", he makes it sound like a completely different song, in a slow, jazzy way. If you're a die-hard Billy Paul fan, you may like this a lot, or if you just want ""Me And Mrs. Jones"", but don't want to get a more pricey disk, than this is the one for you."
4,potty training book,I think this book has increased my 2 year old's interest in the potty. We have a bit of trouble with some of the examples as we don't cloth diaper and it shows a cloth diapering situation. We change some of the words to fit our family. This has helped him be more aware of potty training.
2,Boring for a Two Year Old,"I like Dr. Sears and his parenting advice and I appreciate that this book shows pictures of breastfeeding, cosleeping, etc. However, my two year old found this book to be terribly boring and isn't interested in it enough to read through it even once (and he loves to read books!). The illustrations are just very flat and the story is extremely boring. The book goes into every aspect of what you'd want to teach your child about potty training- but I've already told my son these things (wash your hands, etc.). I guess I didn't need an instructional book for my son, but a book to get him excited and actually wanting to try using the potty once he understood what was involved. I recommend the books ""Super Pooper"" and ""Potty Pirate"" for this purpose and he also loves the movie ""Potty Power"" and will sing the songs from the movie."
5,"Excellent book -- useful for parents, too","This book has a simple text that any child can follow, plus many extra tidbits of information that you can share with more verbal, inquisitive children. There are also several pages devoted to parents, with advice and tips on making the process as easy as possible. Best of all, the book encourages confidence and independence. My son (just turned 3) has been potty trained for a while but still asks to read this book from time to time!"
5,All of the principles meshed with my own,"I LOVE this book because it reinforced principles that I agree with. I really feel that this book helped my child realize that I was not the only one telling him these things. Things like if there is an accident, that's okay and sometimes going special places you'll still need a diaper and that's okay too. THANK YOU SEARS FAMILY!"
3,Attachment Parenting Potty Training Aid,"My husband and I practice attachment parenting and like the illustrations in this book. However, the text is a bit much for our one year old, so we are going to wait awhile before we reintroduce the book. Thinking a child may need to be at least 18 months for this book. Also, my husband commented that they forgot to show the bags under your eyes that are inevitable when practicing attachment parenting. :) Most likely not a favorite for those who disagree with attachment parenting."
2,not that good of a item,"To whom it concern,I bought this book thinking it would help me and my granddaughter to go potty. Also, it post to come with a poster but it was rip out of the book. It remind you of a book how to go to potty than a comfort the child and tell the child what is going on. I can't beleive i bought this book the worse thing is i bought it for a penny but I got charge $3.99 for the shipping . I quess i won't buy books again from Amazon.SincerelyMitzi Havlik"
2,over the rainbow. the music of harold arlen,"Unfortunately I expected more of this 2 CD set. I thought a lot of the performances were not quite up to the standard one is used to from American Entertainers. While Celeste Holm was a wonderful artist I think her best is past, yet Betty Garrett was ok. (even reviewing this in 2008 from a 1995 recording) Some lovely music but overall I think it could have been performed better. In all of this I realise it was a benefit concert so good luck to the performers."
3,Decent- Like Not Love,"The book was a little dry, but in preparing me for my AP exam, I feel it did a decent job. My teacher substituted chapters from other books as well, so the information lacking from the earth and its people was compinsated. Although dry, the book opened my awareness to many components involved in world history. I liked the book, but didn't love it."
4,They are OK,"These are not as good as the Red Lion socks. I have big calves (well, really I have ""cows"" not calves!!!) and these socks just don't stay up around my calves while riding. So, not my favorite. Also, they seem a bit too thin for my liking. They didn't chafe while riding like I though they might. Still, Red Lion are better."
5,Well Written,"This book is a joy to read. Jaspers has a real talent for breaking down complex thoughts into detailed, easy to read format. Jaspers presents a broad overview that should be attractive to newcomers. More advanced readers will appreciate his style and his refreshing perspective."
5,Definitive book on the subject,"Finally the subject of Russian and Soviet battleships has been given the treatment it deserves. These interesting vessels have been generally overlooked by naval historians. Steve McLaughlin has corrected that situation with his impressive work. Deeply researched with newly available Russian language sources this book provides the first in depth look at the technical and operational histories of these vessels to be published in English. It is a must for anyone with an interest in gun armed capital ships, the Imperial Russian and Soviet Navies or naval aspects of the three major conflicts of the first half of the Twentieth Century."
1,stuffed animal not verystuffed,"If you want a stuffed animal that's not very stuffed, than this is for you. It has a velcrow closure that doesn't stay closed and if I knew it had velcrow I wouldn't of bought this product. It as cute as the picture but it's very cheaply made."
1,Eloquence betrayed,"I bought this ballet with much expectation. Unlike the Irek Mukhamedov, Alexander Vetrov, Maria Bilova, Lyudmilla Semenyak Bolshoi version which is truly beautiful, particularly in Act III, this ballet is unwatchable. The Miami reviewer gives a glowing two paras in the first review of this version, and in the third para pans it bare. There is no method or story in the ballet. I am sure Bolshoi gave its name to the performance for a fee, providing the ballet with novice dancers. I am certain there is no Grigovitch choreography followed by this ensemble. This is a NO NO purchase!"
3,Watch highlights on utube before you buy,"I Martinez Ybor has an eloquent and favorable review with which I do not want to quibble. Just a warning: if you own the Vasiliev and/or the Mukhamedov versions, you might want to check out highlights of this version before you plunk down your money. If you do not, check highlights of those before you make a final decision."
2,I expected better from God...,"Occasionally fascinating, sometimes provocative, more often than not badly written, boring, repetitious, incoherent, out of date, morally questionable. Clearly written by ignorant and arrogant propagandists a long time ago. Clearly not written by any kind of God worth worshipping."
5,Jesus Saves!,"The book of our Lord should be read by All His Children (that means YOU!) His Holy words must be abided (or you will go to HELL). All His Holy words are right here, waiting, waiting, waiting, to be read. I Love Jesus. Amen."

4,Vengeance-Not all that great,"Vengeance was a decent PPV to say the leas,Here are the matchesCoach & Cade vs Tajiri & RhynoDecent opener, with some cool spots 5/10Chris Jericho vs BatistaCool match, Jericho does really good against Batista 6/10World Tag Team ChampionshipsLa Resistance vs Ric Flair and EugeneNot bad, Flair does a lot better than usual 4/10No Disqualifications MatchKane vs Matt HardyPretty cool match with both beatin the hell out of each other with all sorts of objects 5/10Intercontinental Championship MatchRandy Orton vs EdgeAn awesome match, best of the night.

4,Awesome ppv,"1. Tajiri and Rhino vs Garrison Cade and the CoachGreat opener, although I wanted to see coach hit with the mist and gore,winner Tajiri and Rhino 5/102.

4,a massage client favorite,"I've been using this all-instrumental cd in my massage sessions for 3-4 years and it's the one cd that clients enjoy well enough to almost always comment on. It has a variety of instruments without hitting one jarring note, the tracks have a nice flow, and the music is uplifting and rejuvenating. At about 60 minutes long, it fits the average session time nicely, too."
4,pretty darn good,"accurate information a good intro to moderate occult practitioners guide, intended for use with a partner, the great rite is the wiccan third degree or golden dawns highest is sex magick, as well as runic positions like freyja's seidr."
1,More complicated than it needs to be,"Frankly, Sex Magick is much simpler than this book would have us believe. Masturbate to enter an altered state of consciousness over a Sigil. Have extended periods of sex to accomplish the same goal. Simple, no? And, guess what? That's all this book says, as practical information goes. The rest is conjecture, faulty history or useless anecdote specifically there to make you impressed."
5,Great Family Camera,"We have had this camera for a little over 2 months now. So far, so good. The picture quality is better than any camera I have owned before. There are lots of different tricks you can do with it. I am still reading the manual and learning about it. The flip screen is a great idea. It protects the touch screen from getting scratched. It's also great when you set the auto timer. The WiFi is very easy to setup. I used it with ease the first time. Be sure to install the software before playing with the camera. After seeing everything it can do, 3 of my friends have purchased one too."
4,"gift, happy with purchase","This item was a gift from my daughter to my husband. He was very happy with her choice. It takes nice pictures, is easy to use and he loves the large view screen. Only negative if any movement the pictures are a not as clear."
3,Pretty much as reviews state it,"It's a very cool looking little camera. The wifi is very limited. I'm a bit upset at kodak for this. They want to trap you into spending more money so they make it so you can't independently access any of the wifi features. You have to sign up with T-mobile to use their hotspots, you have to upload the cameras through kodak, you can't just send them to your computer, they MAKE you use their software, not cool. When you email pictures, you actually mail a link to your gallery through kodak, you can't just mail the pictures. The interface is a good idea, but very hard to operate. The buttons you have to touch with the stylus are SO SO SO small, you frequently miss the right button, it feels as if this is an unfinished idea, but none of this stopped me from buying the camera, hopefully they upgrade the firmware, but for now, only buy it if you want to put in some work."
1,"Great Idea, doesn't do what you think it should.","[....] Wi-fi, large tilt screen, 6.1 mega pixel, built in memory. Got it today and so far I haven't gotten a good picture out of it yet. I've tried all kinds of settings and situations. You can't email the pictures, just a link to them on Kodak's site, you can't upload them to your computer, you sync them with their Kodak program. The screen tilts 180 degrees only, so you can hold it up and point down and see the screen but not hold it waist level or lower and angle the screen up to you. The video is really clear but again the screen angle ruins the function. I am very very disapointed. [......]"
4,"Wonderful, practical camera!!!","Wonderful camera so far, no problems to report, only con is that when I upload the pictures to my computer, they are HUGE, so I have to put them into an application to downsize them, but it's ok... the pictures are so clear with the high megapixels... I am still learning how to use it, but it's so wonderful! The best part I like is the swivel screen, which is good so that I don't scratch the screen while not in use. Battery life is sufficient, touch screen is AMAZING, I highly recommend this camera."
2,Disappointed,"Purchased this camera as a Christmas gift for my daughter last year. It worked great for about the first 6 months then she started having problems with it. The camera refuses to turn on, even with a new battery or when using the AC adapter. Disappointed with both the camera and with Kodak's service department."
2,a poor choice on two grounds,"First of all, this is a strange production that bears little resemblance to any libretto of this opera you might own. And you will need a libretto since Opera d'Oro videos do not have subtitles! Pass this one up."
2,I thought chocolate was BROWN!,I have dark brown hair and usually use that to cover gray hair. I thought chocolate would be a lighter shade of brown but the gray hair turned out an orangey red copper. It looked awful with my light olive toned skin. It took 2 more tries with dark brown to get rid of the copper. Well now I know. Maybe this will be useful to someone else.
5,Great product,I love this Henna because not only does it coats my hair deeply it also softens my hair. The color and health of my hair is superb. I'll never use any other coloring product but this.
5,Great product,These products are really good. They cover the gray(must leave on at least 45 minutes). Use color safe sulfate free shampoo and conditioner to keep color longer. If you use a strong stripping shampoo it will strip the color right out. Dandruff shampoos are especially good/bad for this. This can be good or bad depending on if you like the color.
2,Don't Go Near The Water,"Another example of Hollywood adopting a good book and turning out a poor movie. If you want something to entertain you for a few hours, buy the book instead."
5,Awesome movie!!,"I first saw this movie when I was a kid. Now, 20 years later, I still love it! The dialogue is so clever and the actors' delivery makes it even more so! The jokes have never lost their appeal even though I can quote the entire movie! A definite must-see for comedy-lovers!"
5,Holds up well,"This is a pretty good comedy about the goings on at a backwater area of the Pacific during WW2 and the PR staff of the navy. Good solid performances top to bottom with Glenn Ford holding things together. I remember seeing this in the theater when it first came out and enjoying and I found that I still enjoy it today. Not any sex, nudity or swearing in it so it could not be made today. But if you enjoy a nicely made film from the era that has good acting and gentle comedy this is for you."
3,WB could have done better!,"This has always been one of my favorite movies. I was so happy to see it finally release on DVD. However, Warner Brothers could have done a much better job on the DVD. It is shown in a 2.35:1 widescreen format. I believe that Amazon said 1.78:1, which is incorrect. The case says remastered, but I found the quality of the picture way below what it should be. The picture is grainy and the sound is only so-so. For the price, I was expecting better. There are NO SUBTITLES. You would think if it was ""remastered"" they could at least add that feature. Having said all this, the movie is still a hoot. Glad to add it to my dvd collection. They just don't make them this entertaining anymore."
3,Very Short,"Unfortunately I didn't read the fine print prior to purchasing this DVD.It is only 15 minutes long. It's not bad though as a quiz for a beginning German student. There are no translations. The entire video is in German. The DVD references a website for study material, but nothing comes up in the website. So while it's not a bad DVD, it's not the best I've ever seen."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"I was a little disappointed that the version of Soul Makossa on this CD is not the original from the early 70's. It's not just remastered or remixed, it's totally re-recorded - more polish, less groove. And because of the vague liner notes, I'm not sure where this version even came from. What redeems this disc is that it's a great listen overall. Lots of funky beats and layered rythms backing a mean reed blowin' by Manu! Texturally, some of it reminds me of Remain in Light era Talking Heads. It's just ashame that the funkier original version of Soul Makossa wasn't included."
2,Not for me,"As much as I enjoyed Jabula from the same artist, I got quite disappointed with this album. I must admit that I was expecting the same kind of music, and so I got disappointed when I found a succession of slow tracks. I mildly enjoyed the first track but to me the rest was simply boring.I do understand that people may be looking for slow, relaxing music in order to reach altered states of consciousness, but if this is what you are looking for, I already have a collection of CD's that I think are much better at it.To put it plainly, this album is neither good for active listening, nor is it for passive listening.I also need to add something: this is the second time I buy a CD basing myself on its reviews, and it it the second time I get disappointed. I wish there would be more realistic reviews out there. So were have the realistic people gone to?"
5,Magnificent collection of songs!,"I never heard of Portia Nelson until I found this CD about two years ago (the original albums were recorded in the early to mid-1950s, before I was even born).Although Portia was an accomplished composer (""Sunday in New York""), these 24 songs (some timeless standards, others somewhat obscure) were perfect for her marvelous soprano range. The only instrumental accompaniment needed for these albums was lovingly provided by Norman Paris (of ""I've Got a Secret"" fame) and his trio (piano/celeste/accordion, bass, and guitar). Norman was a marvelously gifted musician and arranger, and put great loving care into his arrangements, keeping Portia's voice as the focal point.Sadly, I found out that Portia passed on some time ago, but we are fortunate to have her music around for years to come."
4,Taste Is Grand,"I absolutely love to drink coffee a lot. Nevertheless, I just keep getting tired of the same old brand of instant coffee. I always need to spice up. That is why i purchased this flavor of General Foods International Coffees drink mix, orange cappuccino. The taste of it brings out a simple mist of orange boldly mixed into whatever flavor of coffee you taste. The smell of the aroma is absolutely devine, when it is mixed with your favorite brand of coffee. This is one of the few flavors I abolutely adore from General Foods, and it is definitely worth the price.Price: B+Taste: A-Overall: B+"
5,I Miss You Orange Spice Latte,"I have in my possession a very lonely, empty can of General Foods Int'l Orange Spice Latte. I can't seem to find anymore and had thought my grocer decided to de-shelf it. I can no longer find it on the GF website either. So, in desperation, I emailed them about this dilemma but have not heard anything as of 05-31-12. This is a most wonderful mixture and should be reintroduced."
2,Atlas Snowshoe tote,"The bag is plenty big and fits the shoes easily, but the zippers are very small and not rugged at all. One broke the first day I used it. I would think that the zipper would be more durable for a product like this."
2,This CD has got only one good song...,"..and that is ""Touch it"". It's good steady soul but basically pretty boring and unspectacular. Monifah sings as well as always . Unfortunately I see no real highlights. A good & steady soul album and a nice new gem for your collection, but nothing sizzling"
2,"Nooooo, Mo'Hagany, Mo'Hagany","What made Monifah think that she had to change her image, wear less clothes, and sing dirty lyrics to sell more records? She was doing fine on 1996's Moods...Moments (it did go gold, after all). When I heard ""Touch It"", which only sounds good in the club, I knew that no good would come out of this album.There aren't many good tracks on here (well, there probably was back in 1998 when I bought it, but there are none worth remembering today). In fact, the only good song is the very last one, the gospel-flavored ""I'm Loving You"". This album made me not want to buy her following album, Home (but I don't think anyone else bought that album, either). If you wanna hear great R&B, I recommend her first album, but definitely NOT this one."
4,Excellent Job Monifah!,"I'm not a big R&B fan overall, but I make exceptions here and there when I hear a talented performer, and Monifah is IT!She can really put a girl in ""the mood"" if you know what I mean! ;)Such soul, such heart.. she's got it all goin' on!"
2,Will you still be listening to this after one month?,"It might seem catchy and fun at this moment, but, seriously, it's just too explicit and one-hit wonder type. Save your money."
3,Did't Please Me to Much.,Monifah To me Is agood singer but her album wasn't all that! Monifah's is like a role model to me but I now that she could have done better I mean I know alot of friends of mine that couldn't wait to get her Album when we got it we allsat down and sat down andheard it and when we finish listening to the album we all agreed she could have done better. We stilL ARE FANS OF HER BUT WE HOPE NEXT ALBUM WILL BE BETTER THAN THIS ONE.
1,Not even worth a star,"I never purchased this cd, but I've heard it from a friend, and I have to say that this is the worse piece of music I have ever heard. All she talks about is sex and she's SO horny all the time. I guess I prefer the old r&b better. Because now, the r&b artists seem to be talking about sex. Especially Monifah. And did you see the music video? She's SOOOOOOOOOO ugly! Yuck! And how can she even have a child with some that looks like that? EWWW Nasty! I have heard better from Monifah though. Just not in this album."
1,Garbage,"Like the other people said, the item is not what the picture is shown as. This is practically a scam, isn't it? Of course, there is no speakers, and if you got slim, you won't be able to charge it using this because the the power thing doesn't actually gets plugged into it. Unless they meant that it gets charged through USB, than sure. It's pretty much a plastic to put your PSP on. Buyers, beware."
3,CD Packaging,"Although packaging for CD was in place the case for the CD was cracked when it arrived. Obviously when shipped the case was already cracked, and the packager must have know this. Somewhat disappointed to receive damaged material from Amazon."
3,A beautiful sound,"It has a beautiful sound, and it is really nice for enjoying a quiet evening in front of the fire."
4,great movie,"This is a great Clint Eastwood movie. Charlie Sheen and Clint work well together in this movie. It,s action and drama all together."
3,BUILDING THE EASTWOOD COLLECTION,An...OKAY...Eastwood film. No great but okay. At least you get to see a young Sheen BEFORE he totally lost his mind.
1,Wrong movie in the Right case,"I received the wrong movie in the right case. Even the dvd showed to be ""the rookie"", but was actually a movie called Tight Rope."
5,Truly A Wonderful Book!,"This is really a great book. At first I found it a little slow and complicated, but once I started to get into the story I couldn't put it down! ""Wuthering Heights "" is a moving story filled with love and tragedy. It is very interesting and descriptive, and the characters and their personalities are familiar by the time it's over. I thouroughly enjoyed it , and I think most anyone else who reads it will, too!"
1,Please... stop... i'll jump from a great height!!!,"Emily Bronte was a sad and sorry woman. Her novel is overated, long winded and utterly painful. I have not yet managed to finish the book as i find cleaning under my fingernails sublimely exciting compared to the prospect of reading this book. Emily.. get a life. HSC students don't do related!"
2,"GEESE, WHY DOES PUTARURU HIGH MAKE US READ THIS BOOK","This book sucked, i think it is the most boring book in the world, people say it is the most compelling novel of all time. I say those people are crazy. How do they expect us to gain university entrance when reading a book like this. By the way, how old was nelly dean, and why does it confuse us with the two catherines. And id also like to ad, Catherine Linton is a selfish tart, and Heathcliff needs to get a life.!!!"
2,"A decent book,but few people probably care for it nowadays.","I like to think of myself as an above-par student in high school,and somewhat educated.I have a taste for good literate as well.But,this book is not my cup of tea.I cannot speak for everyone,but I will try and speak for most:this book was good if you really dig the theme:love,revenge,the English Countryside,etc.Love and revenge and such are cool,but this book is not written in such a way that it totally captivates people.It's a shame that people cannot emerse themseleves in it that they could have,say.....100 years ago.Sorry,but.....it's nothing too special."
4,SCOTTY putter,"Bought this product for the wife. She loves it, she used to play a two-ball and prefers this product hands down."
4,A fine album.,"I have had this album for several years; and I still enjoy giving it a play from time to time. One of Ms. McBroom's greatest qualities is an ability to draw you into the music. With her you do not only hear the song, you feel it....in a way that is genuinely heartfelt, rather than neurotic. I have to say that my own personal favorite is ""The Dieter's Prayer,"" a song for anyone whose love of food is as great as their love for music. If you ever take yourself too seriously, listen to it. This album is a real keeper."
4,A fascinating collection of historical stories,"A nicely done book that should be read by anyone who wants to understand some unique aspects of Maine history. The book is not, and does not seek to be, a comprehensive history of the state. Instead it focuses on about twenty unique, but little known, events that briefly put Maine on the map or are just good stories. There is the story of how Maine was part of the nations early navy history in capturing a British ship during the revolution, the Aroostook War, the teenage who kept a lighthouse operating by herself, Andre the Seal or Samatha Smith, the teenager who was invited to visit Russia. The book is a delightful and easy read and should be read by every Mainer."
3,"Good lessons, but...","My son enjoys this DVD and asks to watch it but there are two reasons we don't watch it that often.1. The DVD doesn't automatically go to the next lesson. You have to manually select the next lesson with your remote or on your DVD player and I don't want to do this every 3-5 minutes.2. There is a scene of a young boy getting out of the front seat of a mini van. He is way too young to be riding up front... he should be in the back in a booster. These are the kind of things my 3 year old notices. He wants to know why that child is not in the back seat.If I had known these things ahead of time, I wouldn't have purchased the DVD."
1,Deception!,"I knew this wasn't the REAL Thin Lizzy when I bought it. I knew it was Lizzy Lite with John Sykes on vocals. What I didn't know was that the tracks on this EXTENDED VERSIONS compilation from BMG are the EXACT ones that appeared on Lizzy's ""One Night Only""--minus three and re-sequenced to fool you into thinking it's a different set. True, this CD is very inexpensive, so $$$-wise it's not a huge loss. My problems is that I already bought this as ""One Night Only"" and now I bought it again. Do yourselves a favor: if you want a live watered-down Thin Lizzy CD, buy--...--EXTENDED VERSIONS, but not if you already have ""One Night Only.""..."
1,Scam,"I'm here to solely bring down the rating on this abomination. Not only is not the real Thin Lizzy with ol' Phil, it's just a re-hash of One Night Only. Cut and spliced with the tracks in a different order."
5,it's havalina so you know it's amazing!,"wish these folks were still together making more sweet tunes but there not.(sad face here) some songs are crazy weird at times but if you know who havalina is then you should know how well they do what they do! and boy, do they do it so well! love/have all their stuff! if you like surf/latin/punk/russian/jazz/country/blues-rock then by all means, dive right in! (very talented and diverse band)"
3,Interesting,"The easiest way to describe this unique sounding album is to think of all those elements in the title mixed together musically. It's like space lounge music mixed with bullfighting and other Latin music elements.The lyrics are sometimes entertaining. My favorite is the song about Pluto: ""Not quite a planet and not quite steam, Pluto's somewhere inbetween."" And the final track, the ""Space, Love and Bullfighting Suite,"" I find to be a work of art."
5,Soul touching music,"What a treasure this cd is! Sonia has carefully crafted melodies that show the brilliant writer that she is. Even though i dont speak Ukrainian i could feel the passion behind her lyrics. A ""must have"" to warm your heart."
3,Would get 5 stars if it looked like the photo...,"It may have just been the seller I bought mine from, but when I got my momo plush that was suppose to look like this, I got the other version instead (theres two types of momo plush if you google search it and I wanted this one because it looked cuter). The one I got didnt have a cute round head and instead was kind of a whole flat piece that was a bit lumpier and didnt have the perky tail. It still did its job as a cosplay prop though..so I am giving it 3 stars."

5,Unreal,"My family just started juicing around christmas. We are amazed at how great we feel and look! I have small children and none of us has been sick this year! The juices are great! We have two juicers because we travel some and were ever we go our juicer go's with us. A must read book, as well as all the other books by Jay."
3,Good book but not too practical,"I started a 10 days Juice fast and I indeed needed a good source of info on the fruits and veggies that could be best for me. This book is full of useful info and a nice read.I still find myself wanting. The book is not that well organized. It lists effectively a lot of fruits and veggies but the association between them is not as complete. I believe remembering A fruit compatible with B fruit compatible with C fruit but C fruit not being listed as compatible with A fruit. Why?I would have also liked to get a list of non recommended mixes.In clear, the potential good combination is not complete enough.The not good combinations are not even mentioned.So it is a good basic book but it left me wanting for more. Complete book of juicing as a title is enticing but not as truthful as I would have expected."
3,Only for beginners,"This is a good book to buy if your main goal is to learn why juicing is good for you. It gives you good information on all of the health benefits of juicing, but if you were looking for a book that is full of new recipes to try, this is probably not the best choice.If you are looking for an intro with basic recipes then this will probably fit the bill."
2,not what I expected at all,I hoped this would be chock full of great recipes for juicing...particularly what to juice in combinations. This has more health tips than recipes and I really did not enjoy this book.
2,Disappointing,I bought this book for the juicing recipes but I was very disappointed with the ones in the book. I've found better recipes online for free.
5,"Buy this book, improve your life","This book is an outstanding reference. Michael Murray has written a book that will help change your life. I have lost 22 pounds in the past 3 months and improved both my health and well being using the recipes and guidelines in this book. As part of a healthy diet, juicing can change your life.I bought this book after reading the many other reviews and wanted to take the time to come back after I had actually used it to provide some input. This book combines a wide variety of recipies with nutritional information and very helpful advice, of all of the books I have reviewed and/or purchased, this is by far the best - buy this book, you won't be disappointed."
2,Only OK,"I found this book to be very helpful and full of knowledge and facts on nutrition and health. However, I agree with a previous review that it is poorly organized. It isn't what I expected and sadly, I am probably going to return it. As far as recipes, I think it's all about taste, what friends and family recommend, and the Internet."
3,juicing book,"good book, I already juiced a lot, so its kind of a no brainer. I do like the nutrition aspect though."
1,Waiting...,Im STILL waiting for my book its almost been a month. I dont know what else to do. i really needed this book for a clss but I have not recieved it or any additional information...
1,total rip off,"Why do we need complete shows? Meaning now it has to be 2 DVD's? Meaning now look at the price.I bought this because I wanted to see ray talk, and we have people in our family with bad hearing, the credits on Amazon here say its Closed Captioned, no its not, Amazon, please remove that from your credits.Also, to release a DVD in 2006, a TALK show no less, without Closed Captioned, is an automatic F+, flunk, zero stars, we just cant pick zero stars.Also, who CARES about boring Tony Randal?!! And some fat ugly environment leftist whacko!!This could of been paired down to just all Ray, and thus, One DVD.and one of the all time dumbest segments on a DVD with no CC! , a ""HEARING"" doctor, Dr Rosen, talks about all things hearing, and NO closed caption availability! DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHH"
4,worth it,"this book needs to be updated and re-published with newer information. if you can find a copy of it anywhere, get it. it is worth it."
4,A book that all first responders should read.,"As a member of the New York Guard this book has knowledge that all members should have, I have enjoyed reading this book.Sgt R.L.Martinez"
4,New Wave low power trio...not bad,"A busy keyboard, basic bass, a guitar that sounds like a bass..and a lead vocalist who sounds like a cross between Annie Haslam and Debbie Harry - Alison Statton.Highlights: flowing, mid-tempo INCLUDE ME OUT; mixed-tempo COLOSSAL YOUTH, and the finale, FINAL DAY. (Have no clue as to musical notation - melody reminiscent of the Jaynettes' ""Sally Go 'Round The Roses"").Concert sound is okay but the lead vocalist needs more presence..as the light, cottony style of Statton is the most distinctive element and...the words matter, too.Recorded November 21-22, 1980."
1,Won't run on Windows 7!,"How can we continue to be delighted with Aladdin's Reading Quest, when we can't play it? It won't run on Windows 7. Wish they would either re-do it for Windows 7 or put it online so kids could play it, learn from it and be enthralled at the same time. A great program, now no longer doing any good. We've just ordered it's counterpart ""Math Quest"" but fear it won't run for us either.We are a very disappointed home/field schooling mom and nine-year-old!"
4,Nice smaller enclosure,Good enclosure smaller thn the first one I purchased. I did not use any blowers or fans so I didn't use the wiring diagram or the power block. The enclosure only rotates 2 ways upand down for the camera and right side up to upside down so I had to use slats to angle it the direction I needed.
4,Dark Pilgrimage,"Pilgrimage is a dark work of historical fiction which mixes plague, medieval religion, and a range of medieval characters into a black, murderous pilgrimage by Brother Martin. The monk sets out to avenge his order whose deaths were the result of a calamitous visit by a beautiful plague carrier. Martin himself miraculously survives the horrible death of his comrades, but feels tremendous guilt over opening the door to Death incarnate. As he recovers, he discovers the power to call down holy fire to destroy wickedness and evil in the world. Unfortunately, as is often the case, Martin becomes corrupted - immersed in the very evil he despises. The characterisation and psychology of this novel are alone worth the reading. The disturbing horror of Martin's pilgrimage make it worth re-reading. Pilgrimage's plot is a little convoluted, but then so are the themes and the setting."
2,Not so great,Ordered the satin HP paper. Price was great and it shipped on time. Paper does not lay flat after printing and you have to be VERY careful that you do not get fingerprints on the paper before printing. It smudges after printing and sometimes has little random spots where the ink does not stay. I will stick with just plain glossy photo paper from now on.
4,Very good for crossover soca,"I understand that a few people thought the lyrics of this album needed some work. They must not be very familiar with contemporay soca music. This is Party music. Not music for soul searching. In general party music tends to be focused on 3 things: wine(figuratively and literally),women and song.Having said this, this album is an excellent example of caribbean party music. The melodies are catchy. The beat is infectious and makes you want to dance, groove , jam and wine. The songs flow well into each other and you can just play the cd for a good party without having to play dj.This is SOCA FETE music. Play this when you just want to sweat and have a ball.If you want lyrics or social commentary try CALYPSO, the more serious sister of soca."
5,OMG!,OMG! kevin lyttle brought reggae to a nu level. his songs r soo hot n wanna make u dance through the wholecd. if u don't got dis.....u stupid as can b.
1,CAN'T TAKE THE SOUND,"I'm a really big fan of dancehall music. It's orginal and it makes me get up and dance. I couldn't give this album anymore than 1 star because of one thing- the sound of his voice. I love the way the songs sound, but his voice just turns me off. Sorry, if his album does do really well, but his voice is just too annoying for me to pay $12 to listen to on a daily basis."
4,"Kevin Lyttle ""Kevin Lyttle""","""Turn Me On"" (10/10)""Last Drop"" (10/10)""Never Wanna Make You Cry"" (7/10)""Call Me"" (10/10)""I Got It"" (9/10)""Sign Your Name"" (7/10)""Screaming Out My Name"" (8/10)""My Lady"" (8/10)""Ya Kiss"" (9/10)""Dance With Me"" (7/10)""Dancing Like Making Love"" (8/10)""My Love"" (8/10)""Drive Me Crazy"" (8/10)""Turn Me On (remix)"" (9/10)Soca singer Kevin Lyttle's debut is suprisingly refreshing. If you are in the mood for some island pop, then pick this up. Standout tracks include the hit single, ""Turn Me On,"" ""Last Drop,"" and ""Call Me.""Overall rating: 8.4 out of 10."
2,You Americans are missing out with this album,"There are only two great tracks on the version of this album that I bought in the UK. These are Turn Me On and So High, and the second of these isn't even on the American album.Turn Me On is a classic and I really hope Kevin comes up with another one as good as this but he won't do it by rehashing that one.Go to www.amazon.co.uk and buy the British version of the album."
5,Love it!!!,"Admittedly, I bought this album because I am also a Vincentian and was showing support for my fellow countryman. Of course, I loved the song ""Turn Me On"" before I even knew he was from St. Vincent, but one song does not compel me to buy an entire album. I must say that I was blown away by how fabulous this album is, fellow countryman or not! Almost the entire album is danceable and just gets you energized and ready to party! Great tunes, catchy (sometimes funny) lyrics (i.e., ""You've got my python begging for mercy"") and just all around ""upful"" vibe. I listened to it at the gym recently while running on the treadmill, and it kept making me want to stop and dance!I highly recommend this album!"
1,$116 for the Kindle edition?,"Seriously? I can accept many things in this world, but $116 for an ebook is not among them. Surely this has to be a mistake in pricing."
4,Cover Art is a Sassy Catch,"So i am a sucker for shopping for unknown music at resale stores. Sue me. I look for the albums with the best cover art. this one's cover art impressed me more than many other albums that i've seen. i wouldn't mind meeting the artist. regardless of the coverart, there are many other things that are good about this album. it goes from queitly psychedelic to rock your face off at an indie concert with a bunch of ""scene kids."" that's my opinion at least. let it be said, let it be done."
4,Still Fab!,"Eartha Kitt has what it takes to make my knees weak!This album shows that while time has changed her voice, she still can use it to the best effect. This album has that fun you expect from Eartha, but also has a serious side...slightly wistful, even.""Back In Business"", ""Let's Misbehave"" and ""Moon River"" are standouts on this disc."
2,Not like I remember...,I have read better renditions of this fairy tale..sent this to my children for the grand children & our kids were highly disappointed in the story.
5,3 billy goats guff,Thank you for sending the book. I lost my copy and all the libraries around here said their copies were lost. It made the classroom enjoy doing their writing/reading assignment. They could compare and write easier because of your quickness in sending the book.
2,unhapy with this book,"I was looking for a few classic titles for my 3 year old son. This came up as a suggestion. I saw many positive reviews so I added it to my cart. I just finished reading it to my son for the first time and I am very unhappy with the story. As I read the story aloud to my son I had to edit the lines like ""I've got two spears, and I'll poke your eyeballs out you ears"". Really? this is a good line to put in a child's story? I must say the pictures are beautifully drawn so I will let my son look at the pictures and make up his own story. There are better versions of this story out there."
1,not helpful at all,"i bought this book to try to learn how dreams, memories, and imagination all interact with each other; this book is written in a very dry and scientific manner so that it is of no help to the average person; i read about half of the book and quit reading it, it was so bad."
5,Red Hot has nothing on Sriracha!,It's so good. You can put it on everything. I'm almost done with the bottle & I got it a week ago. I can eat a fresh jalapeno with little to no feeling of heat so I personally wouldn't it consider it that spicy.
5,Strong and very complete,"I thought it would be hard to put in but it was not.The kit was so complete with a bracket and lots ofdifferent screws and bolts.It even had a cable toreplace the old one. Just great, very pleasantly surprising."
2,Autoloc door popper kit,"The kit was very complete and very reasonably priced... After I installed the shaved door handle kit, the passenger actuator became very hot and would not work. I called customer service and was told I would have to purchase a separate actuator which I did because what I had was not working. In the future I will look for something with a better warranty than that."
3,Only for indoor use,"I was given two pairs of these, not purchased on amazon. One looked extremely cheap and was made with very thin yarn that gained holes just by sitting off by itself. The other looks much better made and is warmer.These can only be worn outside in dry areas, so don't get them thinking you can even go out to the mailbox if you live in the Pacific Northwest. The sole is very thin. Also, even a slight breeze blows right through these.The feet portion of both are very large on my feet, while the part that goes around the leg is very small. I have to either fold mine down or let them be frumpled because pulling them up the way they ought to be cuts off my circulation."
2,poorly (and cheaply!) made,"When I first opened the package, I noticed that they were, well, of cheap quality... I put them on, and they were MUCH bigger than I expected... The first pair of mukluks that I purchased - not from this company - were a medium; so that is what size I ordered... I am a 7.5 in women's - these were huge on my feet. I was hoping that they would be of higher quality..."
2,Mukluks,"Comfy, but not made as well as I hoped. Socks are different sizes so I tend to trip over one of them. I ended up taking off the leather because the stiching came undone. Pattern is nice and they are warm but for the price I wish they were made better."
2,Mukluks,"I had bought the mukluks once before, and although I bought the same size and the same product. They were the wrong size, my daughter could not put them on, and one of the mukluks had a hole where the sole is. The first pair are still good, and she still wears them."
1,Have yet to receive it,I ordered the slippers on December 27th and still have not received them. My Visa has been charged. I am not impressed. I emailed them two days ago and have not heard back. I expected better.
4,Excellent survey of African Christianity!,"We often hear of the Christian church fathers such as Calvin, Luther, and other ancient Europeans. I've often wondered about the ancient African Christians, especially those within the southern 2/3 of the the continent. Well, this book gave me all my answers and more. The author additionally explores those in the diaspora of Brazil, the Caribbean Islands as well as the U.S. He evens mentions the African Christians in Europe and the ""Bombay"" Christians. An excellent intro to a subject long overdue. This book should be read along with Elizabeth Isichei's History of Christianity in Africa and Mark Shaw's The Kingdom of God in Africa. The text contains a fair amount of moderate proofreading/editing oversights, however, it's still a great book. My thanks to the author."
1,Color Staining!,"Hi-I purchased the black color. At first these were great and comfy, but this past week all of the sudden I took them off and my legs were black from the excess dye on the inner shearling material. I also tried wiping some dust off of the surface of the suede with just a normal white towel and (I didn't even rub hard) as a result, the towel turned black. I am not sure what to do at this point, it is such a hassle to send the product back but I am unfortunately very dissatisfied at least with the black color I chose. Maybe the manufacturerer should perform colorfastness testing prior to releasing these items in the market. Is there a way to rectify this at this point? Any recommendations would be very helpful. Thank you-"
1,a total waste of money!,"If you just want the look of Uggs, these are a good idea but they are NOT COMFORTABLE, I should have been wary of other reviews and not purchased them- but they are not comfortable, I can't imagine possibly wearing these in a snow storm or even rain- THEY ARE HEAVY, they weight your feet down.I would have much rather have spent 100+ on actual Uggs- there is truly nothing worse than feeling like you totally wasted your money! Actually not a total wate, my dog is enjoying ripping out the EXTREMELY CHEAP lining!"
4,Good alternative to Uggs!,I bought these boots for my 12-yr old daughter for Christmas. I wouldn't pay the high price for Uggs. These are a good alternative and she is very happy with them. I hope the quality and durability is there because she is wearing them outside in the Maine winter weather. It is to early to tell. They are a good looking boot.
3,soft but not my favorite slipper,"The sheepskin is nice and soft and the leather seems nice. What I don't like are the soles. They are not flexible at all. They are so stiff they don't flex which causes your heel to slide up as you walk. They also pinched my toe a bit, but I think that would have been corrected with time as the leather stretched. However, if the leather stretches my heel will slide out even more so I am not keeping them to see what happens."
4,loose in the heels,"I ordered my size, 8, they are true to size, except in the heel area, they tend to slip up and down when I walk in them. Trying to decide if I can live with that or return them. Pink is true to the color shown. Cozy and cute otherwise."
3,Good price for quality,"The quality of these Jacques Levine books are indicative of the price. They are warm, though they are definitely harder to walk in than UGGS because the suede is not really soft. The bottoms are a bit hard also. I bought the black boots, and though the picture on Amazon has a white lining on the black boots, mine were in black and the color stained my socks and feet, whichever way I wore the boots. This is a good price for the quality, and a decent investment if UGGS are out of your budget. However, I don't wear these boots as often as I'd like becuase I expected them to be more comfortable than I thought."
2,disappointed,"I purchased these boots on sale and am disappointed. Even though I ordered a larger size based on what others said, my toes are cramped and my heel is too loose. The boots are very stiff in the toes as well. Hopefully that will change with time if I continue to wear them. I am, however, 100% satisfied with the first and second pairs of Emu Ridge shearling boots I've owned."
5,SO ADORABLE!,"I was kind of worried about getting these boots because I was contemplating if I should just save money for UGGS. But I just went with my gut instinct and got these. I got it in the color Taupe, and I LOVE THE COLOR! The are really comfortable and they seem like they will last a long time. I was skeptical about which size because I've heard stories about these kind of boots being too big on someone or being extremely too small. I just got my size and they fit perfectly. I recommend going up one size if you might have wide feet. But If I were you I would try your original size. They felt tight at first when you put them in, but consider this...I'd rather have them tight then slipping off."
3,Good and Bad,"I bought two pairs of boots, same size (1/2 size larger than I wear as only run in full sizes). First pair I loved, so I ordered second pair in different color (chestnut). Second pair was smaller fitting than first so had to return for another pair. Third pair is ok but doesn't fit as well as first pair. So...if you luck out and get size that fits right they are great but each pair is different so good luck!"
1,Dissapointed,The ring did not fit.Ordered a size 6 but got a size 9. Eventhough they resent the item even that was the sameThough I had planned to order many more items am not confident now
3,Product covered in packing tape,"The product is of good quality, but there is sticky packing tape all over it that will not come off. Product is a 5. With packing tape stuck all over it, I give it a 1."
2,Worked well needs a better handle,Pail was great excited and did well for a week but the the handle on the lid came apart..so I returned. Will not purchase again
5,As Advertised,This pail is as advertised and arrived in great condition. Pail is sturdy and cover fits tightly which helps keep dust from spreading.
5,Outstanding mixture of boodie shaking music!,"Not to sound redundant, but I LOVE this album. I saw them promote this CD live and it was an outstanding show. Nobody can make you boogie like the Whigs can. I have to put it out of my reach so I don't play it to much and get tired of it."
4,Amazon CD isn't the original pressing,"Just a heads up that the CD you get via Amazon is not an original pressing and doesn't contain the original materials. It looks like a mass duplicated CD with no a very spartan booklet in the case. The back cover is a bad photocopy and very blurry. Upon closer look the package says the CD was created by Amazon in Kentucky and when inserted into my computer it says the disc is a CD-R.For the price of a ""new"" CD you could probably find a used one much cheaper with the packaging complete.Four stars for the music. One star for the packaging."
3,h,"""1965"" was a bit of a dissapointment to me. Of course it is a lot different compared to ""Gentlemen"" and ""Black Love"". They lost intensity on this album and that is too bad. There are some good songs on it though (City Soleil!)."
3,Good rock album; so-so Whigs album,"The complex layering we've grown to love in the Whigs' music is largely drowned out on this album by blaring horns and piano, and 1965 suffers from it. This album is certainly more fun than any previous one by the Whigs, but the loss of intensity overshadows this. But here's the thing: Afghan Whigs are so good that this is still a fine album. Particularly promising tracks are ""Crazy"", ""66"" and ""Citi Soleil"". It's no ""Black Love"" or ""Gentlemen"", but just because it doesn't quite live up to the standard the Whigs have set doesn't mean it's not better than most albums out today."
5,The most accessible album from the Afghan Whigs,"Of all their work, I consider this the most accessible work from this great band. My wife and some other folks close to me jumped on the bandwagon after hearing tracks from this album particularly (Crazy, Sweet 66, Going to Town). The fact that this album did not garner more commercial success and national acclaim still astounds me. If I was to recommend an Afghan Whigs album to a person who'd never listened before, this would be it (not counting their retrospective of course). This contains the most refined and accessible collection of Whigs tunes available on a single album.I love this album."
4,GREAT BAND,"REALLY I GAVE THEM A FOUR BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE CATALOG AND NOT BECAUSE OF THIS CD. THE CD BY ITSELF IS A 3 IN MY OPINION. REALLY DON'T NEED TO SAY A WHOLE LOT BECAUSE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT WILL PROBABLY CHECK THIS ALBUM OUT ALLREADY LIKE THE WHIGS ANYWAY. THE MALLCORES AND EMO'S PROBABLY HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THESE GUYS. I THINK IT'S AMAZING HOW LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM HOW MUCH OF TODAYS RADIO PUKE HAS ELEMENTS OF THIS SOUND IN IT. MAKES YOU WONDER, WELL ATLEAST ME ANYWAY!"
2,"Groovy, yet utterly uninteresting","This band has had some interesting moments over the years, particularly their seminal release, ""Up In It"", which featured alt.punk classics like, ""retarded."" THey made an MTV worthy breakthrough with ""Gentleman"" but after that their legacy just sort of trailed off...This album yearns to be a come back album, along the lines of ""Gentleman"" but it comes up short in every way.The main plus to this album is the funky, groovy drum beats and guitar hooks, but they sound dry and uninspired compared to earlier whigs efforts.Also, the lyrics are grating and monotonous.... you'd think he'd find something else to sing about after all these years, right!?If you are a die hard fan, then of course you'll want this album for your colleciton,but if you're new to the whigs, start with Gentleman."
1,I sold mine,"I am a person of many interests, including most any kind of music. Even though I didn't like it one bit the first time I heard it, I thought I would give this album a fair chance, so I listened to it several times. I bought it for the song ""Crazy"" which I do like, however, everything else on this album is just plain boring and awful. I don't think this band is very lyrically talented, and the song with the chick moaning is very trashy. I was listening to it at work, and it's a good thing the boss didn't walk in or I would've had some explaining to do! So needless to say, I got rid of it, and will never buy anything else from this band. Don't take my word for it though, because the other reviewers seemed to like it. I just didn't."
5,A Masterpiece. Buy it now!!!,"The Afghan Whigs continue to bridge the gap between R&B and Rock n Roll. They are the most creative and vital artists of our generation. This lp is a landmark record. It rates up there with Sgt. Peppers, Straight Outta Compton, and Paul's Boutique as a record that will change the face of music."
2,WHAT 3-D?,"I've only seen one of the three features on this set previously on videotape (the first ""America's Greatest Roller Coaster Thrills in 3-D""), and I must say it is one of the better roller coaster videos--for almost every coaster covered, you get a general overview as well as a ""first-person"" view from the front car for the entire ride. And the 3-D effect was pretty good. The problem with this set, which is why I gave it only two stars, is that while the first two discs are ostensibly in 3-D, you don't get any glasses with it. The back cover claims the video features ""incredible depth perception optical illustions when viewers wear 3D glasses!"", but there are different types of 3-D glasses (red/green or polorized), so I doubt that many people are just going to happen to have a couple of extra (and compatible) 3-D glasses lying around. A 3-D video without the glasses is, quite simply, not in 3-D. I'd call the title of this set very misleading."
1,nup...,"Just by looking at the album cover and reading the comparitive bands, i must say these guys would fit in the ... basket. I wouldnt waste 2 mins of time to download one of their songs. Go check out Arch Enemy or The Haunted."
4,Chinese Link,"Good resource for learning chinese, especially since this version have the pin-yin of the readings in the back. It helps a lot, in order to learn one has to understand the words."
5,"""A real page turner.""","I enjoyed ""What Am I Doing Here?"" so much. I started reading it and found that I couldn't put it down until I finished. I would like to see Jim Kesey write another book about Dusty Kohl. I read some parts to my husband who was in Chu Lai, Vietnam also but he told me to quit because it hit too close to home for him. After all those years he still suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome. ""What Am I Doing Here?"" has helped me understand what my husband experienced.Mel Sigle, Hebo, OR"
5,At peace with our nations past,"Most of us who experienced the southeast asian experience of the 60s and 70s are reluctant to review the absurity of war. Mr. Kesey's highlighted recolection is at minimum theraputic. More than just another well written book, WHAT AM I DOING HERE, actually evoked the long forgotten smell of; combat, brotherhood, suffering, and fear. At times I wanted to stop reading but foud myself drawn to the books ability to steer me to inner peace. I suspect Mr. Kesey will be a carpal tunnel candidate very soon."
2,instructions are not applicable to the product,and written in Chineseglishthe description and drawing in the instructions did not correspond to the elements of the actual product
1,There is a reason..,"...you can buy this book for a mere penny.It is trite, badly written,discriminatory poppycock.End of story!"
4,Originally entitled Rogue Male,"Just FYI: This was originally released as ""Rogue Male"" which is still available."
3,A mixed bag,"I first heard of, and heard, the Reflexe series on LP. I've owned the CD series for a while now, and have listened to some of it. The packaging of the reissue is decent, though some of the surreal artwork, which must be seen to be believed, and which continued on some random single-disk reissues, is slightly cropped. I believe it's actually 60 CDs.As for the performances, I concur with a reviewer who wrote about the reissue when it was first released: these 60 CDs provide an excellent overview of performance practices during the decade when historically informed performers were coming to prominence, but individually they're a mixed bag--many are still outstanding, while many others haven't stood the test of time.Academy Records had a copy of this set a few years ago. They sold it to the 20th century composer John Zorn."
3,Too short and contains events not in the war years. This makes it too superficial,"Given the enormous speed and consequences of the events from 1939 through 1945 when Franklin Roosevelt was president, no video 50 minutes in length can do any real justice to the level of his accomplishments. Furthermore, while the title says ""The War Years"" there is a significant amount of time spent in describing his initial campaign for president as well as his actions in attempting to end the depression. Finally, descriptions of the rise of fascism in Germany and Italy as well as the Spanish Civil War are also included.For these reasons, this video does not give a review of Roosevelt that is thorough enough to be of significant value in teaching the history of the era. It is a nice overview, but the lack of depth makes it a superficial description of Franklin Roosevelt's accomplishments."
1,Boring,"Some may think that Ann-Margret showed class when writing this but actually it's just boring.It goes along like a freight train, no depth, substance or insight. Comes across as an extemely vain woman who is manipulated by her manager/husband. Where was the gossip, this is what sells a book, not all the rubbish in this.Avoid at all costs. Totally void of any depth."
5,David Patrick Stearns Quote about the CD,"In this world of post-modern cynicism, how often do you hear a new song andthink it's a masterpiece? That happens on Audra McDonald's new disc, notonce but four times. The rest of it is pretty fine, too. And on repeatedlistenings, it all gets even better.Masterpiece No. 4 is Ricky Ian Gordon's A Lullaby,in which the words are meant to prepare a child for the complexities andsorrows of adulthood. The music's sweet and sour harmonies unfold in a hugecrescendo, expressing those ideas poetically as only music can. Gordon'sstyle is more mellifluous than the others, his music is perhaps the mostsubtle and reveals the most secrets upon repeated hearings.""David Patrick Stearns USA Today Friday, November 20, 1998"
4,the bright blazing star of Audra McDonald,"If you want to hear a woman's voice with an astounding range who doesn't squeak, squeal, or whine, but emotes music with power, drama and passion- buy this CD. Ms. McDonald's voice is astounding. While some of the music is somewhat inaccessible, tracks #2 and #10 alone make the CD invaluable."
5,"Even ""music snobs"" may like this : )","I was expecting a recording of ""showtunes,"" a genre which I used to like, but as an opera singer have grown to find tedious and repetitive. Not so. This album is full of relatively unknown composers, mostly very talented and exciting. It really made me want to hear more of their work. Songs like ""The Allure of Silence"" and ""Baby Moon"" are so luxuriant and simple, I could not resist them. Singers will appreciate McDonald's warm, emotive sound, which really does the composers a favor in many cases. BTW, if you liked the John Michael LaChiusa songs on the album, I recommend getting the CD of his musical ""Hello Again."""
2,Voice 10 Songs 3,"Brava to Ms. McDonald's championing of a new generation of theatre composers -- too bad their songs aren't better. Most of them seem to be aping Sondheim's worst flaws -- dreary tunelessness, vague muddy tonality and harmonies, fussy overly-self-conscious lyrics -- while NOT aping Sondheim's real strengths -- his fierce theatricality and turbulent romanticism.The songs on this album are vaguely, weakly experimental but ultimately academic and inert sounding. These songs are NOT the future of the American Musical Theatre, I hope."
1,A true disappointment,"With such a magnificent voice as hers, I was hoping it would be used for songs which are at least ""singable."" The songs here are way out in left field. I, like a handful of others, have listened once and that is all. I hope future albums by McDonald will be full of songs which emphasize her wonderful voice."
1,an atonal mishmash,"After reading a glowing review of this CD in the newspaper, I could hardly wait to buy it. I have loved her voice ever since I first heard it. What a disappointment. Not a melody of any kind in sight and nothing to spin around in your head to enjoy when the music ends. Now, if I just knew someone to give it to who doesn't like music."
1,Skip this one,"C'mon folks, let's get real. Audra McDonald is quite a talent, no doubt about it. I've seen her on stage four times and she's riveting. But the material on this CD is awful. If these guys (Adam Guettel, John LaChiusa, et al) are the future of musical theatre, we're in big trouble. During their formative years, they should have mixed a little Jerry Herman and Cy Coleman into their listening habits, instead of nothign but Sondheim and Kurt Weill.Even Audra can't rescue this dreadful music."
5,Some of the best music you've never heard,"I've had the Micro's album ""Beauty Based on Science"" (which makes up most of disc 2 here) since it came out in the '90s...an amazing album that I haven't been able to recommend to anyone since it's been out of print.Happily, Cuneiform Records has decided to rectify that situation (and then some) with this.The Micros music is fun, freewheeling, irreverent and swings like a mother...sounding something like avant-garde spy movie themes played with their feet in traditional New Orleans and their heads in Manhattan's ""Downtown"" scene. Highly recommended."
3,Get Acid Music 2 Instead,"I don't know why Amazon is still carrying Acid Music 1.0 when 2 has been out for quite a while. There's not much price difference, and 2.0 is much better than 1.0 - built-in MP3 support, it comes with a lot of loops, the interface is cleaner, and you can publish directly to AcidPlanet.com. There is no reason whatsoever to get version 1.0 - go search for Acid Music 2 right now."
1,A thin read,"It's lacking in some of its reviews and a lot of the important sites seem glossed over rather than sounding like the authors experienced it for themselves. However, most of the facts in it are already out of date. There are better books out for those with Ireland in mind as a destination."
2,Out of date,"A fair amount of the information is now out of date. For example, costs are shown in Irish Pounds but the currency of the Republic of Ireland since January 2002 is the Euro. A fair number of the listed restaurants have closed. I'd wait for the next edition or be sure to carry another book or two."
4,Hard to let go of.,"I realize that they are postcards, but I don't think I am going to be able to send them to anyone. I love the artwork too much. The colors aren't quite true to the actual pieces, but I am sure it was mass-produced. Other than that, these are beautiful miniatures of the real thing."
3,Misprint???,"As with all Pope's novels in the Ramage series, an enjoyable read, not his best, but enjoyable all the same. My only concern was that the copy that I recieved had Chapter Four all scrambled up. The first page carried on following the previous chapter, then proceeded to go onto ramblings of the First Lt for half the chapter, and then switched to Mid Orisini reading the instructions for the mortar firing. All in all more than a bit disconcerting. I had to read the Chapter twice and double check that the pages were correctly numbered. After that the book went fairly well.As a serious reader I persisted, but I could see where a non serious reader may have given up or been turned off at reading more from an outstanding author and historian. I can only hope that my copy was a misprint and not a sample of the book publishers art."
5,"En el camino de la imaginacion, la musica es tu guia","La musica tiene la fuerza de transportar tu mente a sitios diferentes, este cd hace honor a esa frase, cada cancion es un viaje, haciendo las letras de Enrique tuyas, las mesclas con tus recuerdos haciendo este cd un viaje atravez de la compacion, el amor, el pasado, presente y claro, el futuro."
3,FLAMINGOS,"IM GIVEN THIS CD 3 STARS BECAUSE I SERIOUSLY THINK THAT AFTER ALL THIS TIME WAITING FOR IT, BUNBURY COULD DONE SOMETHING WAIT BETTER. BUT HE STILL ROCKSSSSS!!!!!!"
4,"eclectic, romantic, contemporary, intelligent, cosmopolitan","Un disco, sobrecogedor. Quiza no tan ""limpio"" como ""Pequeño"" pero con mérito propio. ""el club de los imposibles"" te hace girar en un tacón, te hace mirarte frente al espejo y sentirte sensual, famoso, decadente, feliz. Esas trompetas, ese descaro! ""contar contigo"" y ""mundo feliz"", introspectivos y soberbios a lo máximo. ""hoy no estoy para nadie"", saturado de asco existencial.El único pero es la canción ""ciudad de bajas pasiones"": intracendente, grandilocuente, sosa.Consejo: escúchalo en random play."
3,Lo que NO deben esperar de este disco,"Desde la separación de Héroes del Silencio, Enrique Bunbury se ha caracterizado por ser parte de una nueva era de música y estilo, una combinación exquisita de sonidos y tierras inexploradas en lo que se refiere a un mix de varios géneros musicales. Entre sus cambios desde ""Radical Sonora"" a ""Pequeño"" y ahora a ""Flamingos"", ha llegado al punto en donde cada uno de sus discos refleja una época diferente, y todos podrían ser un primer disco sin tomar en cuenta los demás.Lo que NO deben de esperar de éste disco es un ""Radical Sonora"" o un ""Pequeño"". No tiene ""Nada en Común""."
4,"Dogs are Really Humans in Disguise, Right?","What if your dogs became human? What kind of people would they be? THe premise keeps kids intrigued, the bad behavior of the dogs-turned-people make them almost as bad as Rotten Ralph (Jack Gantos) and their retransfiguration is just as wonderful as the mayhem they cause."
2,Too Tight of a Fit --Disappointing,"This case is well made of high quality materials, but it has two major flaws: (1) This case is too small to accommodate the camera that it was designed for. It's just too tight of a fit. It needs another inch of room; (2) The case doesn't provide adequate protection from a fall. The material is just too soft. Unfortunately, it's made for people who don't drop cameras.I was really disappointed with this item. When will they finally get it right?"
5,Great Little Camera Case,I purchased this case for a Nikon Coolpix S30. The case and camera were gifts for my 7 year old nephew and the camera fit perfectly while still having room for extra batteries and memory card. A great little case for protecting a camera and easy to access camera and supplies.
4,Fits Panasonic Lumix ZS3 perfectly,"I have a Panasonic Lumix ZS3, and this case fits it perfectly. Not for putting in your pocket, but a good general case for packing your equipment on a trip, with a big external pocket to put spare batteries, and a small zippered external pocket for extra SDHC cards. Decently padded, belt clip, long strap for putting it around your neck. All for a great price."
3,surprisingly good for a blended sauce,"For a blended fish sauce, this is actually pretty good. Apparently it is a mixture of a good Thai sauce (like Squid), a great Vietnamese sauce (like Red Boat), and some water and malt. The combination is quite tasty, though overall I prefer Squid and Red Boat straight."
2,Contains hydrolyzed wheat protein - not Gluten-free.,"Be aware that this fish sauce is not gluten-free.This brand of fish sauce was highly recommended by a popular food blogger who posted an enticing recipe I wanted to try. I figured I'd try her favored brand of fish sauce... until I saw the ingredients. The inclusion of hydrolyzed wheat protein is a big disappointment. I decided to pass on this one.I did find another fish sauce that looked promising, based on the reviews:Thai Fish Sauce - 24 oz. Ingredients: anchovy extract, salt and sugar. That's all that's needed. I just received it and cooked with it for the 1st time - love it!"
4,THE CHILD DEVIANT,"I love this album and I'd like to give it a five start rating, but the same complaint I have always had with VAC is present on this album as it is on all VAC albums....there are always too many songs where the vocals are recorded too low to understand. Asside from that one complaint...there are sooo many good things to say about this album. In my opinion ( and yes, I am a total Electrohead) this is the best album in the ""Between The Eyes"" series released by Metropolis Records. My favorite songs on this album are ""Sex Desease"", ""Let's Kill These Mother*******"", and ""The Calling"". If your new to VAC, I would describe them as Neo Industrial/Heavey EBM."
3,pretty good album,"this album is pretty good. it's not really all that dancefloory, like fun with knives. it's more like bryan's earlier stuff, as well as hex angel. if you're starting out, i'd really recommend ""fun with knives"" or ""twisted thought generator"". but, if you're a vac fan, then definately get this one."
5,"Good, reliable product with top-notch customer support","I bought this grinder when it was a new product a couple of years back and it has performed well with near daily use all this time. They have excellent FAQs and documentation on their website for people who have any questions on operation or need to troubleshoot a problem. If you call or email them, you get a response or person on the line quickly who will walk you through assessing the problem and will send you out a replacement part, at no charge, asap. Companies like Baratza(and amazon.com) still understand how to create customer loyalty. If you need a conical burr grinder (any coffee enthusiast does), you'll get years of use and enjoyment out of this one."
3,Baratza Virtuoso Conical Grinder,"As soon as we brought the grinder home, that day the timer stopped working. On manual mode it did a decent job of doing espresso grind and general duty. After a year, it can only do coarse grind. For the baristas out there, yes we clean it often."
3,Talent sometimes shines through,"I loved Yvonne Elliman in the 70's. I waited for this CD to arrive with high expectations. I was a little disappointed because there were only 2 or 3 songs that gave me that old feeling about her. The rest were just OK for me. To me, it was worth the price for the 2 or 3 songs that gave me that old feeling. You can only answer whether it is worth it for you."
1,Not any help at all...,"As a Foreign Currency Dealer, I was NOT helped from this book at all! Actually the title is misleading since he does NOT concentrate on FX, he only shows some graph examples using FX crosses instead of stocks... The author just refers to a lot of TA indicators only reviewing their typical Buy and Sell signals that are written in every TA book, and furthermore the sections are very bad structured. Really very very disappointed!!!"
2,Not Very Comprehensive,"Not recommended for beginners reading. I would think that the reader is hiding alot of knowledge from us and he would be writing another book to complement this. Maybe make some more bucks.Good points are his explanation of oscillators and calculations formulas.Bad points are his classical charting techniques havnt been clear, not for someone like beginner. J. murphy be better i think.Cant get much out of this book yet."
3,cannot find a niche,"This book is easy to read and quite comprehensive. But the TA techniques are not very specific to the FX market. If the author can give more explaination about using TA in the FX then this book should be a best buy. There are many good TA books in the market, but most of them only discussed TA for the stocks and futures markets. I feel there should some differences between them and the FX market. This book should have fill this niche, but it didn't! Sigh!"
4,highly recomended(sp),Written in simple to understand language. With easy to follow explanations of various chart patterns.
3,To be critical is to be constructive.,"If this book is very bad, I am glad to learn it from people who consider themselves knowledgeable and who have read it. But should it be possible for such critics to propose another reference which they appreciated the content. It would be much more instructive for readers who are shopping for quality books."
5,a contributor comments,"Being a populist poet myself, I found this collection a joy to participate in and read.This proves what I thought all along: regular joes read poetry, not just high toned academics. I hope more collection of this ilk, will result because of Pinsky's and Diet's efforts."
4,Great book on nutrition,"This is a great book for teaching nutrition to the very young. Cookie Monster never fails to capture the attention of kids, and Bert and Ernie do a great job showing Cookie that there is more to life than cookies, veggies are great, too. My only concern about this book is that Bert and Ernie use a stove without an adult, so parents will need to remind children that real little kids don't do that."
4,Tag Team Back Again...,"I Think this album is underrated. This may be a One Hit Wonder group to some people, but this has bass for sure. I enjoy songs like ""Players Land"" and ""Booty Low"" these tracks will drop low bass with tight lyric's."
3,A well structured approach to the subject.,"Shanks has produced a solid undergraduate text. It has many examples and is well supported by case and discussion material. Also, the book makes good use of the Internet as a support medium. I am not aware of whether or not an instructors package is available. If not, that is a failing."
3,"Good condition product, delivery is too long.",The condition of the book is decent as described. But the delivery was very very delayed. It took them about 2 weeks to ship the item and another 10 days to deliver it. That's not what I read when I ordered it. Be careful.
2,Pith Roll Indicator,Belo average qulity product The indicators are not accurate and seem to always get stuck. not very accurate or reliable.
3,Big is not better,"The illustrations far surpass the text, which is just as well, as the book is just too big to handle for easy reading. Not even in the race when compared with Kenneth Clark's Leonardo of decades ago. Pity about one of the paintings being reproduced the wrong way round. Size is no substitute for quality."
1,New edition now available from Taschen,Why don't you have the new 2012 Edition of this book on offer? The early 2000s version is now out of date due to at least two major restorations at National Gallery and the Louvre? And due to the recent scholarship done for the show at the National Gallery . . .
3,Hold on to your books on the paintings!,"I was literally aghast when I opened this giant, lavish production to see page after page of the paintings bound right down the center and into the spine of the book. I can't imagine what the publisher was thinking. Tashen books are never really good books, but could they really exercise such poor judgement when using such a large amount of resources?On the positive side, the drawings are excellently reproduced and are rarely split. Fortunately, they constitute the vast majority of the book. However, the book should be purchased for the drawings only. The treatment of the paintings is offensive. So much for a comprehensive source on Leonardo. Hold on to those books on the paintings, when you buy this one!"
1,Stay away from Dorman parts,"Control Arm lasted for about 3 months. Like the other reviewer mentioned, the joint cracked and started making lot of squeaking noise while turning and going over bumps.Better to spend little bit more on Moog or BeckArley parts."
1,Dull beyond belief!,Having been on the QM2 if I had seen this beforehand I would probably not gone. This could not be a more boring account than I could imagine.
2,The reason why it is bad...,"...is because a major ingredient that ruins it is soy sauce. You just don't think of sweet and sour sauce as being salty. Instead of throwing it away or returning it to the supermarket where I bought it from, I mixed one part of the Kikkoman Sweet & Sour Sauce to one part honey to make it taste better. I bought it just to try something different but I'll never buy it again. I'll just stick with the La Choy Sweet and Sour Sauce which also does NOT contain high fructose corn syrup."
1,NASTY,"Second what the reviewers had to say here. I wanted to get something similar to what they serve at Chinese restaurants. This 'puke' actually is more reminiscent of the BBQ sauce on a cheap TV dinner I was once ill-advised to buy. Sick, sick taste!Kikkoman should be ashamed of themselves for putting this out on the market! I will never buy ANY of their products again, not even their good soy sauce. If the manufacturer could care less about what they put out there, I could care less about that manufacturer.Given every line has better and worse products, but this one is just the spit in the face of a consumer. Like other reviewer said, it is not worth one star, this one is worth 5 negative stars!"
4,Storytelling is easy,"It's a useful book for parents who want to share excitement in storytelling. We can call it guidance. It always gives some tips, questions, and story activities for each story. By reading the stories, you can open your children mind up toward moral values. The stories teach children to be confident with them, to be wits, to appreciate differences and to like music. Probably, the one you have to need is to be proficient in telling the stories. But don't worry, because the book will guide you. You just practice it. Remember that practice makes perfect."
5,no thank,Sorry but in the picture you display you have three and that is what i thought that i was getting but i only got one if i was only getting one they should have said so that all
2,deceiving,i like these items however the picture is quite deceiving it seems like i should be getting three and i only get one
1,Never got it,We ordered this in the beginning of December...and never got it. How disappointing! NO WAY to track it. Don't trust this company.
4,Great Value,I love these little things. They make things easier and faster. I use for opening mail and cutting gift wrap. They are a lot faster and cut straighter than scissors. A great value too.
5,helps with more than just letters!,this little gadget is the best letter opener I have ever used.fits perfectly in your hand.it is also very helpful for cutting away string/pet hair from the vacuum cleaner roller brush!
1,Stay away from MobileShark's Sony VAIO VGP-BPS2C Standard Capacity Battery,"I got this Sony VAIO VGP-BPS2C Standard Capacity Battery from Mobileshark back in October 2009. I paid $127 for it. There were ones cheaper online, but I chose this one because it's claimed to be a Sony original product with the same capacity as the original. 2 months later, the battery has completely died and doesn't charge. Even before that, the battery's spring tabs that lock into the computer were completely flimsy. It didn't take much for the battery to pop out, causing my laptop to hard-shut down. The battery doesn't look like the original even though this is advertised as a Sony product. The case has differences in markings, color, and texture and the sticker is upside down compared to the original. I would say with confidence that this is a Sony knockoff. I'm trying to get my battery replaced now through MobileShark."
1,be careful about finding the correct battery,"found that product by looking for a VGP-BPS10. this one here is announced to fit all SZ computers. THIS IS WRONG!!! before you order this VGP-BPS2C verify whether it fits into your SZ laptop. I believed that the SZ model family has the same battery type, I have two different models and the batteries are NOT interchangeable!"
1,Disappointment,The battery was not working at all and there is not specific instruction for return. I was very disappointed.
2,Fair,It saids it will work with all VAIO SZ notebooks but with the 670FN it isn't the battery doesnt fit at all in it.
2,Sony VAIO VGP-BPS2C,Sony VAIO VGP-BPS2C Standard CapacityThe batery is working but when I made the order I thought that was original but was not true.
3,I can't believe it cost a 1/4 of the cost of the laptop...,"I paid $800 for a Sony laptop to only have the battery quit after 1.5 years. Then I paid $200 for a new battery.... Guess what brand laptop I will not buy next time???? It's a crime that Sony pulls this on their customers, I'm sure this battery only cost them ~$20 to make, it's just another way to get money from the customer after the initial sale. Well, you just lost a customer. As for the battery, it charges and works, at least for another 1.5 years....."
3,Battery problems required a replacement,I had problems with the first battery that was shipped. The laptop would randomly not recognize the battery and force Windows to hibernate. When troubleshooting efforts proved inconclusive they replaced the originally shipped battery and everything worked great after that.
2,mean and grumpy book,"I ordered this book for my 7-year old daughter who loves Diary of a Wimpy Kid very much. I didn't like the word ""dumb"" in the title but decided to over-look it after reading an available page. I thought that my daughter could relay to the character because she is a girl. However, the book is simply mean - has mean references to class mates, basically hates this one popular girl and is full of words that 7-year old shouldn't be using. I guess it's my fault - this book is definitely to early but I would not have ordered this book even for a middle-schooler. I feel that this book is full of verbal bullying. Very disappointing."
5,ITS SO COOL,I LOVE NEVER DO ANYTHING EVER! ITS SO COOL.BECUSE ITS LIKE SHE HAS NOCLUE PEOPLE ARE READING HER DAIRY.IF YOUVE NEVER READ IT I TOTALLYRECOMMEND IT AND ALL THE OTHERS.
4,"Pretty funny stuff. (Cute, too!)","My mother brought this book home for my young niece. I read a few pages, then the whole thing. I thought both the story and the illustrations were riotous! Jim Benton may not be a twelve-year-old girl, but he sure thinks like one! I can't wait to see if the other two books are as funny as this one."
1,inappropriate,i bought the series of these books from a different store and after my daughter read part of this one I decided to look into it and after reading a few pages was disgusted with the way this book spoke about other people and promoted interactions between kids that in my opinion is horrible. I am returning the entire series and would not buy any of these books again.
1,Bad Example,"My almost 8yr old daughter begged me to buy this series for her after she saw the catchy title and cover in the store. I consider myself a pretty laid back mom, but I feel that this series is very inappropriate for children. I read about halfway through the first book with my daughter and was very uncomfortable with how the writer was labeling peers as dorks, losers and rating them on the popularity scale. I also did not find it funny at all how the young girl in the book seemed to have a hateful obsession toward a ""popular"" girl in her school. The more I read, the more I felt like these books needed to go back to the store. Now to be fair, my daughter thought the books were funny and entertaining; however, the moment she called her little sisters losers and threatened to cut their hair off with scissors- that made up my mind!"
5,Laugh out loud Funny!,"Dear Dumb Diary (Book #1) is a great book for grades 5th to 8th! Every page you read I guarantee you, you will laugh! Jamie Kelly has some fun at Mackerel Middle School. Angeline is probably the prettiest girl in school. Jamie thinks she's evil. Isabella, Jamie's best friend, is an expert on popularity. They sure have some fun with that! The best parts are when she did something and then it shows a chart showing other times it's necessary to do that.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone below 5th grade. It has some terms that may be inappropriate for young kids. If you like this book you should try the rest of the series! They're all so funny! Also Happy Bunny! It's written by the same author, Jim Benton.Thanks for reading,Olivia (5th grade student)"
5,A Perfect Tarot Bag,I ordered this bag in order to hold a tarot set that I've had for quite some time (after my old bag fell apart). It's well constructed and appears to be sturdy enough to hold up to daily wear and tear. The price was perfect for what I was looking for and the piece itself will hold for quite some time.
4,Cathy Kelly writes consistantly well.,"Whenever I pick up a Cathy Kelly book I have high expectations for it. This one does not disappoint. It covers the lives of two interesting women and it grabs you from the first moment you start reading. Dee has a problem with her image. She can't see what everyone else can and that she has a curvy va va voom body, instead she feels fat and unatractive. Isabel's marriage has just ended and she is finding it hard going with a useless soon to be ex husband. Do yourself a favour and read this one."
3,Good movie,"a very restrained performance from jumping jack jeetu, and chintu excels in his Urdu dialog delivery. The movie is authentic and dialogs classic. The story might seem cheesy for a few (a love triangle) but the movie should be seen not for the story but for the period, acting and language. Rekha supports well with her tawayuff character. Watch the movie if you are a nostalgic film buff of the late seventies and early eighties. This movie seems to be one of the chosen few...nay...the only one to be made on the grand Urdu culture of Lucknow and Muslim Northern India of the past, replete with its full glory and perhaps, debauchery and filthy wealth of its Nawabs."
5,I bought my B&O entertainment system thanks to this CD!,"This CD sports some good background tunes and even 3 reasonably good tracks: ""Always Only You"", ""Trinity Time"" and the delightful light and jazzy ""Timeless"".But buy it for the ""Firedance"" tune - you will not regret it!Alberto De Almar is brilliant. Firedance is an instant classic that is bound to make you engage the REPEAT button to listen over and over again. This tune is a goose bump inducing, neck hair rising masterpiece.My wife and I had a B&O; system demonstrated in Hong Kong, hearing this CD for the first time. We instantly fell in love with the timeless class of both. We rushed to the HMV shop to track down Violin Virtuosity, that was the inexpensive part... We later made an expensive order for a complete B&O; system setting us back several decades of savings but that was also worth it..."
3,Good metal album,It's a good heavy metal album but not the Metal Church we used to listen. It's not like the first two albums. The first one was a masterpiece.
5,Awesome Metal Church album,"This album is different than Metal Church albums before it, but then again, every album is a drastic change from the one before it. This is in my top 3 favorite Metal Church albums, the other ones being Hanging in the balance and Metal Church. The only song I don't like is End of the Age. It sounds like swamp music. Not a metal song at all. Some of the lyrics are kinda dumb, but they're better than the ones on The Human Factor. If you like Metal Church and you don't already have this album, you should get it right now."
2,Not that great,"This is nothing compared to previous works, what the hell are they doing?!?!?! Possibly the worst album cover ever."
3,I have some negative review hope you don't mind,"I had stomach after eating it the other nightAlso, it taste bad after hitted( I know I'm not supposed to do that though)And it's not really a good taste for food, it doesn't really taste that specialAnyway, nice sauce, but for me, I've had lots of sauces and I am not really a fan of this one"
5,Meticulous historical research and perceptive insights,"In Storm On The Horizon: The Challenge To American Intervention 1939-1941 is a compelling and informative history of how America became entangled in Europe's political and military struggles prior to the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor which resulted in a formal declaration of war and overt participation as a combatant. Justus Doenecke (Professor of History at new College of the University of South Florida, Sarasota) combines painstaking and meticulous historical research with perceptive insights and an ability to engage the reader's total attention. Storm On The Horizon is particularly recommended reading for students of 20th Century American history, World War II, and the role of the Roosevelt administration in dealing with American isolationist sentiments."
5,Great,"If I had to have only one VB.NET book, this would be it. Certainly, it is not the only one on my shelf, but it would do well on a deserted island (where a social life doesn't matter). It covers a wide range of topic areas and covers them well. It is not terse, but it still can be easy to gloss over important items. Big and heavy, but opens flat so that it is easy to place in front of your monitor as you read along and try out the topics. Excellent.Edit: now that I have gone through another dozen or so VB.NET books, this is the ONE book that I would keep on a deserted island."
5,Best Reference book I've ever read,"This is an amazing book. Language is clear and to the point. A lot of code samples, which makes the reading through the concepts a lot easier. The book also has a wonderful eBook on supplemented CD. It's in PDF format, hence searchable. I am keeping it always open and no longer wander to web - everything I can ever dream of (yet) can be found there.***Warning: This book is not for the beginners. Author assumes the reader already has a basic level of VB understanding."
4,Excellent,A good meat and potatoes manual that goes well in to the bigger part of the picture of programing software
2,Very sentimental novel,Before watching the movie I decided to read the book. After downloading the book and read half of it I turned the book down by missing actions. The book is a masterpiece of describing a relationship between 2 women and also describing a personality of a unique person but probably I am more into actions which I missed from this book so I decided not to watch the movie either.
4,Carroll CD is first-rate,"Barbara Carroll, who has an annual gig at the piano at Bemelmans Bar in New York City, is a superb stylist in both piano and vocal talent. Her voice has a seasoned air about it and she brings a wordly-wise attitude to her lyrics on love. Her piano playing can be whimsical as well as powerful and she showcases both extremes on this CD, which by the way has many more selections that those listed above. Not all the tracks are vocal tracks. It's a nice listen, whether for background, or full attention listening."
4,A satisfying book,"I enjoyed this book very much. Linenger isn't a great writer, and the book could have stood a little editing, but I felt the author did a very good job of sharing what life in space is like. He answered many of my questions about life in space and explained technical and scientific matters in a very understandable way. When he said part of Mir looks like ""four buses were driven into a four-way intersection at the same time"" I have no doubt about what Mir looks like! So what if he seems egotistical and complained a lot. He took time to write a very readable book about a rare experience."
4,A window into the real world of an astronaut,"As Jerry Linenger capitvatingly and brutely describes his experience with the Russian traning center and MIR leadership, I was both shocked and amused. To the average person, it is unbelieveable that the Russian Space Program was so adhoc, unscientific and unorganized. The disorganization that is described is so prevalent that I wonder how the Russians could manage any space travel sucessfully.Before I read this book I imagined the life of astronaut was a hero's life, little did I realize the patience, team work and politics involved in Space travel.Recommended for it's great story and window into a world very few of us will ever experience."
2,"Brave man, horrible author and book","What a wasted opportunity. If Dr. Linenger could only have put aside his ""mildy"" egocentric personallity, and let someone else write this book--I wonder if an editor was even allowed a glance. Yeager, by Chuck Yeager and Leo Janos is a far superior read for someone interested in space pioneers. Too bad the services of someone like Mr. Janos were not employed. I believe everything Dr. Linenger wrote and yet the book had a very defensive tone. He cares too much about what other people think of him as evidenced by his endless rambling-on about how wonderfull he is. Somehow this encredible story comes across as a boring book."
2,Questionable,"I wonder what political office or career that Dr Linenger has in mind. I found his book to be very self serving with little credit given to others. Obviously not a team player. ""Dragonfly"" is the better read and strikes a better balance."
2,Interesting but horribly written,"If you read past this highly egocentric astronaut's explanations why he's so great it's really interesting. But actually it's a book that tells a story of someone who takes the American living standard as a measure for everything, thus he becomes amusing when he tells you about Russia, like a person who never set foot outside of an American military base.I can't recommend the book despite a nice stories of fire, etc."
3,Not what I expected,"At first I thought this book would be a well written account of surviving on MIR that would keep me interested throughout the whole book. The first couple chapters were good because they gave a good account of the author's life before he became an astronaut. It seemed like he was bragging a little about his accomplishments, but I don't blame him.Later, when he arrived in Russia, Commander Linerger seemed to complain a lot. This whole book didn't have the tenderness of most memoir type books published nowadays.I'm not serious about space exploration, so maybe I didn't appreciate it that much. But coming from someone who was looking for a tender account of an event, I chose the wrong book. This book is probably more suitable for people out torfind books about space."
5,A Must Read for Space Program Enthusiasts,"I wrote this review because I don't think some of the reviews I've read do the book or Mr. Leninger justice. I felt this book tells it like it really was. I work in the aerospace business, with high caliber people every day, and did not find Leninger to be egocentric or a complainer. It may just seem that way to people who are not at his level. He seems to be a very matter of fact person who is highly educated and trained. If you want a book, without the whitewash, get this one. It's a quick and exciting read!"
1,Ego trip,"The book has some interesting anecdotes about life on Mir, but Linengers ego and continuous whining about the Russian space program makes this quite a challenging read. Not recommended - get Dragonfly."
5,My memories,"Thankfully, there are as many opinions as there are people......I heard Patti Labelle & the Bluebelles in 1966 at a ""Murray the K"" show. I was all of 15 and though I had heard them on a plastic table radio and a cheap portable stereo, I was not prepared for the voice, the passion, and her ability to project her voice from Brooklyn to Buffalo without using the microphone (church training will do it every time.)Not all of the material on this album translates well. However, I'll give it a 5 since their vocals are worth every point. Ebb Tide, Unchained Melody and Over the Rainbow (one of the songs I heard live) still knocks my socks off and I'm buying this cd since my album died some time ago. I look forward to hearing her again."
2,Hysterical!,"For years, my best friend Tom and I sent each other albums with questionable talent, and this one takes the cake. ""Down the Aisle"" has moaning and shrieking, and ""Over the Rainbow"" is as far away from Judy Garland's masterpiece that it will surely elicit much laughter. This is one of the funniest song albums ever made - only Ethel Merman's lamented foray into disco music can top it in the ""hideous"" sweepstakes!"
5,Narada,"If you like New Age music and especially that from the Narada artists (many) you can't go wron by this and it also gives you a good taste of each of the different artists featured. Don't forget there is Five different collection as well as the 3 Christmas collections, The Wilderness collection, and 2 Decade collections. Yes, their busy. Enjoy!"
3,There are better Narada Volumes out there,"If you're tired of rock riffs, pop girlies, boy bands, rough rap, and the rest of the radio dial, I recommend you try any of the Narada Collections. Vol 2, in particular, has a lot of multi-layered instrumental tracks that sometimes devolve into ""snoozer music."" The other volumes (1, 3, 4, and 5) are more consistantly up-beat. Most melodies on Vol 2 walk with purpose -- they don't rush your tempo and are easy on the ears. The instrumentals range from stylized piano, electronica, acoustic guitar, and more. The styles range from classical to new age, jazzy to worldly. Its a good sampler, but I prefer the other Narada volumes. Enjoy!"
1,Watch out!,"Be careful when you order from their outside sources. I assumed I was buying a CD, but I was not paying close enough attention and it turned out to be a cassette. When I complained about it, the company told me it was very plainly stated that it was a cassette, and sure enough it was. Do pay attention to all of the description."
1,Not recommended,"This battery is very expensive and not worth the price. The battery that came with my laptop died in about a year, so I bought this one hoping that it would last longer. But it lasted only for a year. Very bad quality. Strongly not recommended."
4,"Good item, way over priced though",On Vista this battery gives me about 4.5 hours. Over priced but if you need extra hours on the go you need it. The old regular battery dies in 20 mins after I have had it for almost 2 years.
