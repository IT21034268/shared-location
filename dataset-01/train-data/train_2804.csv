1,The worst book - I wish I had never bought,"This book has no flow, jumps around from situation to situation. I was never sure from who's perspective I was jumping into. I gave up reading it after the big quake. Couldn't take any more.This should have been a good book, but the story just wasn't there. Characters were never developed and the person I thought was the main character get's killed off in the middle of the story.Not recommended."
1,BORING!,This book is a total waste of time and money. Don't bother even if it's free. One of a very few books I didn't bother to finish.
3,I give it a 2.5.,"If you are interested in this subject you probably already have more information than you will find in this book. I expected an intelligent prediction of what would happen if a major quake happens, but it turned out to be a poorly writen novel. I understand that a second book was printed but I won't be looking for it."
4,First in an Interesting Series,Be sure to read this series in order to get the most enjoyment from it.
3,Fun to read if you've lived there.,I don't think this is a wonderful book. It has big lulls and can get downright boring at points. I lived in Memphis for a few years and that made it more enjoyable to read.The author couldn't seem to decide if he was writing a non fiction book about the science behind earthquakes or a fictional account of social breakdown after a natural disaster. The book got bogged down in the science.
4,Much more than a good story,"I finished Sam Penny's Memphis 7.9 two days ago, but I'm still somewhat shaken! It is a compelling read not only for the thrill of finding out what happens to the cast of characters in his fictional account, but more importantly for the nonfiction scientific briefing on just how earthquakes work. Penny's description of precisely what happens deep underground in the first microseconds, seconds and minutes of the event are spellbinding. If you want to find out something about temblors and how they can effect people's lives, or even if you think you already know something about earthquakes, this is a great place to begin your specialized education. Highly recommended, and perhaps essential reading for anyone who lives within 200 miles or so of Memphis. California may not be the locus of The Big One."
4,I liked it,"I used to live in the area of the New Madrid fault and can attest that the area is not at all prepared for the big one. The author has studied geology and is obviously a student of earthquakes, sometimes sharing too much of the scientific information which impeded the flow of the book. The book could have used more drama of the characters and less scientific information but overall was a good read especially for those who know the area."
2,Not for Houston...,"Not Hirt's fault, but it would have been nice to be forewarned that in a near-tropical climate, this elephant ear variety won't survive!!! My THIRD plant withering proved this. I am a fairly talented gardener and can not make these live. Tried different locations, soil and watering schedules with NO success. Most tropicals thrive in our heat and humidity--this guy withers and dies in a month or so and does not tolerate cold AT ALL. WHERE DOES IT THRIVE?!?!?!?! I give it stars only because it may be suited for another climate and it IS attractive--while alive."
3,Remembering Paul Desmond,"In the jazz idiom, Paul Desmond remains the epitome of the lyrical improvising musicians. This album of his playing with the Dave Brubeck group is a solid representation of that era. There is, however, one piece that will remain a classic: I Remember You. It alone is worth the price of the album."
4,Nice Piece,"Excellent quality, love it. I received a 1921. I was hoping for something in the 1800's. I'm guessing most orders are filled with this date and not prior. Maybe the company will read this and offer me an 1878."
2,Boring...please try again.,I found this book to be lacking in depth of emotion. I didn't feel drawn in to the author's lives or the countries that they were in. Most stories were lacking in description and depth. I would have liked to read from women who were in each country for longer time periods. I am an expat and didn't learn anything about culture shock or how women came through it. Most endings were trite. Like mine.
2,Heh.,"I read reviews on this, making it look superior to electric nose-hair trimmers...but it AIN'T. Using it is a pain, you might as well do one nose hair at a time."
1,Doesn't work well,"The product operates by having rotating blades inside a cylinder with slots in it. The problem is the hairs have to fall into the slots to get cut, and the metal of the cylinder is too thick for this to be easy. Not an ideal solution."
1,"Never received the item, but got a refund","Had on of these for traveling and lost it on one of my trips. Ordered this one from the vendor as it was in Stock. Found out that it wasn't but I have to give the vendor credit, refund came within 24 hours."
2,Disappointed,"This is not a series of tough workouts but it would be good for a beginner. I am used to doing Ab RipperX & Tapout XT which as tough workouts; so this is like several steps down from those. Wish I had not paid so much money for it.The only reason I did is because it's connected with Beachbody; which usually has great workouts, this is not one of them."
2,"boring, boring, boring","I really wanted to like this program, but I was fighting to stay awake during it! Bret is knowledgeable, gives great instruction on form, etc., but the routine is so repetitive and boring that I simply could not continue it! I've tried to work through it twice now, but can't get past the 2nd week."
2,Huge Disappointment,"I have ordered from this seller couple times before at-least and the flowers were excellent. However this time around, first of all some of flowers had petals falling off the flowers and one of the flowers, that had a webbing around it was broken off the stem. Also, this time I got about a third of the usual amount of flowers (usually fills up 2 vases, this time it didn't even fill up one vase). After I put then in the vase, (the damn vase looked half empty) I felt ashamed even giving this to my wife. Huge Disappointment, especially on Valentine's Day. The flowers were delivered on the requested date though, which is why I gave it a 2 star.Quality = 1 StarQuantity = 1 StarDelivery on date requested = 5 StarOverall = 2 Star"
1,Very slow delivery -- no tracking -- would not recommend,"I ordered the Falcon Farms Season bouquet for both of my children and my sister. I was sent a message that the flowers shipped, but they did not provide tracking numbers. It was a full week after they reported they were shipped before the flowers arrived. The long delivery not only made them late for the occasion, but also reduced the quality and shelf life of the bouquet. I tried again recently and ordered another Falcon Farms Seasonal bouquet for my parents. It's been 2 weeks since they reported they shipped, and my parents still have not received them. I don't know what's happened with the service of Falcon Farms. I have used them in the past with good results. But I will not do so anymore."
3,Great product! But....,"The wife and I were cruising Amazon looking for a nice NAMBLA branded stadium blanket when we came across this item. When it comes to bedroom antics, we're pretty adventursome, so we ordered a dozen. All purple, so they'll color coordinate with the marks from our annual holiday ""Winter Whips and Chains Get Together!""The beads arrived in good shape and well packed. In no time at all we each had 6 of 'em packed up the ol' poopshute. To be honest they don't really work that well, we've had 'em crammed up there for over a week and we're still not feeling any ""pleasure buzz"" if you know what I mean.I would not buy them again, I expect better from Amazon."
2,Magic Flute-Complete Opera,"This is a 1933 recording of the most beautiful opera Mozart ever composed. I found the static on the cd distracting, and I was more than alittle upset over the lack of a libretto. I have heard other recordings that do the opera justice, and let one feel the music. I would not buy this again."
4,Vegetable Protein powder,I have been taking this for 6 wks. along with the powder collagen in an fruit/almond milk shake. I feel good and know that the combination is helping with nails/hair. This is also good because it helps keep my weight down by substituting a meal with a protein shake.
1,Awful taste,"I have never tasted such bad tasting protein powder before. I bought this product because the Vega product I was using before was so expensive and this one was very cheap. I thought Vega tasted bad enough, but this product is undrinkable. After barely finishing a cup of this drink, I seriously thought of quitting being a vegan and starting to eat cheese rather than putting up with such an awful taste drink just to get enough protein. I cannot believe Vitamin Shoppe put such a bad tasting product on the market."
5,Hedleymazing!,"I caught their performance of 'Perfect' on the 2010 Much Music Awards and was blown away. I'm a huge fan of 'IDOL' alumni from any country and when I found out Jacob Hoggard (lead) was a previous contestant, I went to youtube and watched all their videos. Then I bought their debut album and 2nd album 'Famous Last Words'. At first, only the songs that I had seen the videos of were super enjoyable. But after several listens, each song is truly great. Jacob's voice is amazing and it's nice to showcase a voice without the ridiculous use of autotune. Absolutely love this band and would recommend to anyone who is a fan of IDOLS, Avril Lavigne, and really good music. Buy this CD!"
3,nuclear forehead,I only bought this cause i found it here cheap and the title track was worth the cheap cd. The rest of the cd was pretty much filler
3,An easy-to-read undergraduate philosophy textbook,"I read this book for philosophy 205 at a northeatern liberal arts university. It was easy to understand as far as philosophy goes. Read this book, if you get the chance, but be sure to discuss it with someone intelligent whose opinions you respect."
1,Someday......,"....we will see a full-length concert video from the mid 1970's (1975 or 1976 would be ideal) from Aerosmith.The material is out there, somewhere.Just waiting to be compiled, cleaned up and remastered.I've waited this long, I can wait a little longer."
4,"Cute, but be careful, the color runs!","This dress had no tag inside, and the color ran and ruined several other garments. Hand wash it - alone!"
3,Coolpix battery charger,I'm assuming the charger is working but the batteries are old and do not hold the charge. Disappointed that I will have to buy new batteries to see if in fact the charger is working.
4,everyone has their opinions,I believe that this is a book that may not be for everyone. I feel that it is a well written book with a lot of useful information. I believe that in order to use the book to it's full capability one must have open views and use the information in individual ways. All in all it is a good book and concept.
3,Way to big,"First, I have just started with the Kipling bags, the are built better then high end hand bags, but though great for everyday, for the price some should look as good as high end leather bags. As to this one, it is Not med. it is Large! The defea is med size.I will keep it as there may be times I have need of a bag this large. The good thing is, unliken large leather hand bags, this is jvery light empty. Though Kipling bags zippers are not pretty , neather are they going to break after a few uses."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this item. Although it holds quite a bit and is fairly light weight, it got dirty quickly and is difficult to clean. Not worth the $84 cost."
2,Repetitive and Tiresome,"Janis Saffell is a good instructor and her workouts are generally well-designed; however, this video was lacking. My main complaint is it felt like half the workout was spent in the the downward-facing dog pose. This has a couple of negative aspects: 1) too much strain on the wrists; and 2) very little time in standing poses that help to open up the hips and re-energize you. I am not new to yoga, but my upper back ached the next day from all that in down-dog. There are much better videos out there. Though Janis' instruction is good, the design of the workout is lacking, and I would not recommend this to beginners."
2,Something is missing...,"Like half the practice.I think this must be aimed at people who are already quite physically fit, but are beginners at yoga. There is too much instruction for an experienced yoga student, but there are some poses that are normally considered too challenging for beginners (in particular, an unmodified Side Plank).After a decent warmup, most of the practice consists of Sun Saluations, to the point where I was really getting bored. Then there is a standing pose series -- the strongest point of the video, I thought. Finally, the instructor takes us to the floor for two quick forward bends and -- that's it. No backbends, no hip stretches, no twists, and especially, no relaxation (Corpse) pose.This is really not a complete yoga practice."
5,coherent and concise,"Oatley has a way of boiling down complex concepts into short, pithy chapters. The writing is clear and concise and the examples used in the text provide interesting perspectives on current political issues such as the US budget deficit or the power dynamics in debt negotiations between powerful international creditors (IMF, World Bank) and debtor countries. The chapters are well structured--with introductions and conclusions that really help draw out the key points of the chapter. I found that this book provided coherent theories with which I could better understand material from other political science and economics classes. Overall, I highly recommend it."
4,gives an understanding of the many forms of globalisation,"Oatley provides a readable, non-mathematical description of international economics since World War 2. The book will give the reader a good grounding in understanding globalisation. Not as something to be feared or tamed, but as arising from fundamental trends that are effectively impossible to reverse.Oatley certainly talks about more than just globalisation. Like managing exchange rates. But even here, it is discussed in the context and reality of a world where immense pools of capital are often highly mobile. This is not typically thought of by the general public as globalisation. But the text shows that capital flow across national boundaries is indeed another aspect of globalisation, that has become common in the last 20 years."
4,What the back cover really says about this book,"""Oatley offers a brilliant text that will soon replace all contenders on existing IPE syllabi. My students find it stimulating, informative, and well written; they latch on to the politically relevant examples and the easy access that it offers to important theoretical concepts. Quite simply, this is the best IPE text on the market."" Jonathan Moses, Norwegian University of Science and Technology""The author has a real ability to make complex topics understandable for college undergraduates."" Francis Adams, Old Dominion University""This is a well-written, easily accessible text that makes theoretical concepts and historical material understandable to students without 'talking down' to them."" Michael Mastanduno, Dartmouth College"
5,Timmy's Journey is just the Beginning,"This is the fourth episode of The Adventures of Timmy the Tooth. Surf's up dudes and dudettes! Grab your shades, catch a wave, and dive into adventure! Everybody's up for fun in the sun; even the clouds are taking the day off, and Timmy's sporting his going-to-the-beach bow tie. There's just one small problem to dampen his spirits: Timmy doesn't know how to swim, and he's afraid if he tells his Flossmore Valley pals, he'll be all washed up.

Even the drippy Cavity Goon's there, trying to cheat his way into first place. (Oh, no!)Get ready for waves of excitement as Timmy discovers the first rule of learning to swim is ""Let's have fun!"""
4,Great sandal but hard to get on.,Great sandal. Only issue is that it!s not easy for my daughter to put on by herself.
4,"Great shoe, but runs small!!!","I had ordered this sandals for my 9 y/o son. When they arrived I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. They looked like very good, sturdy, comfortable shoes, but..... they run small - at least 1 size smaller than other kind Teva sandals. Size 6 (Big Kid) sandals just barely fit my child when other kind Teva sandals size 6 looked big on him.Nevertheless, I DO recommend these sandals. Just make sure you order one size up."
1,Stinks to high heaven!,"We have four children between the ages of 7 and 14(boys & girls) and wanted a shoe for summer that could get wet but would also protect the foot/toes. We purchased four pairs of Teva Dozers. This is indeed a great shoe as far as durability and toe protection - that is if you don't mind keeping them outside! I have never in my life smelled such a horrible odor than what these shoes produce. I will never buy this style again. For ""odor killing"" help I researched microban technology, Teva washing procedures, etc. and followed them to the letter. We even tried ""homemade"" suggestions, but nothing helps! The smell is so bad that we finally threw away all four pairs. Nothing like throwing money down the drain. If you want a durable, protective shoe and do not mind the ""stench of death"" it produces, buy this shoe.Teva Men's Dozer SandalTeva Women's Dozer SandalTeva - Kids - Downtown Ola"
2,Good quality but don't order the pink,"We ordered these for my 1st grade daughter to wear to school as they cover the toes (a school requirement) but still let her feet ""breathe"" (her requirement). They are of a very sturdy construction and she says they are very comfortable. I only rated them 2 stars, however, because there is no way to get the pink ones clean again after they come home dirty (like after the first day!). I have tried everything to get them looking pink again but no success. The uppers of the shoe are a nice light pink and the toes are somewhere between brown and gray. They look terrible and I have a hard time getting her to wear them."
1,Unmitaged disaster,"We purchased a variety of Teva hiking sandal models for a 15 day trip down the Grand Canyon. We wore them around the house and yard for a few weeks to break them in. The very first day in the canyon they started falling apart - the soles delaminated and I spent hours of precious canyon time trying to glue them using shoo goo, aqua seal and gorilla glue. Nothing held more than a couple days. Finally we duct taped them as best we could and hoped we didn't kill ourselves on the hikes by slipping on the duct taped soles. Another customer on the trip also had her Tevas delaminate (we had the spider rubber inserts, she had a full rubber sole). The guides previously had bad experiences with Teva and wouldn't touch them with a 10 foot pole.Teva knew these sandals were crap, and sold them anyway instead of recalling them. I bought some of the original Teva sandals 20 years ago, but will never buy their product again."
2,No Pleasure,"I didn't like it once I reviewed the cuts on it. Glide is on it way to many times, and for all you real Pleasure fans you know there were a whole lot of other jams than just Glide. Don't get me wrong it was a nice cut but come on, three times? Anyway, I had the pleasure of meeting there former bassist Nathaniel Phillps 9 Aug 02 in Denver, Colorado playing with Jeff Lorber, was anybody there? Anyway I asked him was there any kind of way of getting any of the individual C.D.s other than the greatest hits stuff? And he said try Fantasy and RCA, they use to be the records labels they were under. I've tryed and there were no happenins. So help a brotha out if you find something out. By the way I have the ""Best of Pleasure"" it has a better selection than ""The Greatest of Pleaure"" C.D."
4,Wa'D,"I give this 4 stars cause it's pleasure. I've been a HUGE pleasure fan since I used to rock ""lets dance"" on the wheels back in the 70's. The ""Accept no Substitute"" (Ghetto of the mind, dance, etc) and ""joyous"" (title track, ""let me be the one""...) are two of the best funk/jazz-yes I said jazz) lps recorded during the jazz/funk heyday. I have every pleasure joint on vinyl and I'll never let them go. Why the albums aren't available on CD is still a mystery to me. Nate philips is on jeff lorber's(another jazz/funk great) new philly joint. check it out."
3,3 versions of GLIDE is no Pleasure,"When I first spied this CD in my favorite record store in the late 90's I couldn't believe my eye's and hugged my friend who worked there as a buyer. Only to flip the case over to read the back and see 3 versions of GLIDE ........ Glide I said to my friend, you've got to be kidding me. That (to me) was one of their weakest tracks in their entire repertoire. He agreed ..... Maybe it's that like myself our teen years were during the 70's (the hey day of funk) where as Glide come across as some sort of pop tune. Some thing akin to Kool & the Gangs second incarnation as a pop band (read ""Ladies Night"", Too Hot etc.). If they HAD to put ""Glide"" on the CD why didn't they just leave it at the album version saving the remaining space for 2 songs sorely missing ..... ""LET ME BE THE ONE"" & ""I'M MAD"". That really would have balanced the CD much better and I would have felt better buying it."
3,"Pleasure's ""Very Best Of"" CD A Tad Average","If you listen to this CD, you'll see why pleasure was a one-hit-wonder with the tune ""Glide"" back in 1979. I personally like all three versions of the tune here. But it seems the band tried to adopt this Earth, Wind & Fire-meets-Tower Of Power concept with tunes like ""Lets Dance"", ""Dance To The Music"", and ""Future Now"" and fell a bit short. ""Glide"" will always be a old school classic, with various bass players covering it on YouTube. Even the rap version done by Psycho here is just as good as any currently popular rap tune."
2,A little slow,Not quite as funky as expected...rhythms seem a little slow for classic back in the day. Glide is a noteworthy exception.
3,A little disappointing,"Jay Kay of Jamiroquai says this is one of his favourite albums, and you can really hear the influence. Nevertheless, it's a little disappointing because it isn't as funky as i thought it would be, and there is one track - sassafras girl - which is really awful. it sounds like the music they pipe into elevators to turn you into a mindless zombie. Apart from that, the album is certainly listenable, and at times really quite groovy, but it never hits the mark the way i wanted it to."
4,another sweet lil book,"I mean there are dozens of little spell books out there, and while I am not a practicing witch (even less wiccan) and thus cannot comment on spells (thou they do seem simple and cheeky), I KNOW what appeals to my sense of humor and life philosophy. In this book I appreciate the way the author recommended invoking the power of different deities (in my case a nymph) for each horoscope sign. sweet and humorous."
3,Funny!,"This book is funny! Just the notion that I could make my boyfriend my love slave is hysterical! Some of the spells have the right idea, but who would really want to be with someone that they had to put a spell on? That is something you have to constantly keep doing to keep it working. Relationships are hard enough without adding the up-keep of spellwork to it!"
1,spells don't work,I tried a few of these spells and none of them worked. They were the ones to help bring a new lover your way. A nice book but I had to throw it away.
5,....,"I have studied for more than 2 months about ...digital camcorders and I finally found the one for me. That is SCD55.It is very compact and rugged also. There are no more special features than really nescessary for beginners/intermediate users. It has 680 K pixel CCD, digital stabilization, 20x optical zoon and total 440x zoom (including digital), some special effects, photo mode to take digital pictures (though the resolution is not that good) and so on. Also connection to the PC with firewire (or i.link) is so easy that anyone can do that.If I really have to mention the cons, the battery life is relatively short (50 min). However even this would be long enough for casual users for sure.....I strongly recommend this product."
3,Software for setting has some bugs,"I really like the feel and look of this watch. I bought two and the first one worked aboslutley fine till I lost it. The second one had by that time run out of battery although I kept it in battery saver mode.Once I replaced the battery and set the calendar and time on the digital section, the watch would automatically go into SET mode all the time, and in that mode any movement on the knobs would cause the time/date to change.Otherwise, the strap is comfortable and the dial is big and easy to read."
2,Winsome Wood Table,"Ordered for a school, by the time someone was available to assemble it , the box was gone so we couldn't return it when it was discovered one of the legs was the wrong part. Meanwhile the facilities dept. banged it up when they tried to redrill the leg to fit anyway...this was not the manufacturers fault but it wouldn't have happened if the right pieces were sent in the first place. Now we're stuck with a three legged table we can't return."
3,"Great technique, sometimes just ""too many notes""","Art Tatum was unmistakeably a master of the piano and all the other reviewers are right in that he is a cornerstone of ivory jazz (Ray Charles used to say that the epithet ""Genius"" should be reserved for Tatum). Also the recordings are flawless.Still, these are seven CDs full of solo piano, and unlike Oscar Peterson, who leaves plenty of room in his interpretations and allows you to breathe, Art Tatum uses every little pause for a trill or a little run, which is extremely virtuoso, but a little over-the-top from time to time. He sometimes fills up his pieces so much that he smothers the melody and allows no time for the music to take its effect. Even though I like Tatum when the mood hits me, some of my friends can't stand him and I know just what they mean. So before going for the eight CD box, listen to some of the pieces, maybe buy a single CD first."
5,The Nitty Gritty of History,"This set of several volumes of writings was included some years ago with my purchase for my boys of an Encyclopedia Brittanica set. Annals of America has collected plain english arguments which were being made at certain times over America's relatively short history for and against issues such as woman's suffrage, for one example, and before there was a change to a new status quo. It is cool to have the benefit of decades of hindsight on issues in which Americans were considering major social changes. This material provides an additional way of studying history and it provides a lot of practical wisdom, such as, for example, the writing by a New York City Tammany Hall politician where he shows us the importance politically for the administration to rush to the side of and to start providing assistance to a citizen who has suffered some calamity so as to get there ahead of the welfare department."
1,Absolutely wretched,"IF I had BOUGHT this abysmal book; I would contemplate felony charges! Personally passionate about biography, I found this thing to be an insult to the genre in addition to Miss Bankhead. The 'Tallulah' persona would have roared with laughter -- not at the cloying assertions of, OH! God forbid, Lesbianism! -- but at the sheer lack of taste, style, originality, AND talent. Tallulah had all these things; this misguided 'writer,' none. The best use for this book would be inclusion in a basic primer in a creative writing class 101, under the chapter: ""Don't Let This Happen To You!"""
1,Third grade reading level,"Factual, but maybe the most poorly written thing Ive read since proofing essays for high school kids. She played off of a really cool life story, trying her damndest to turn it into a triumph for gay lifestyles in the 1920s and a promo for Dykes (her word) in the 21st century. The only reason I finished it was sheer horrific fascination and an attempt to get my moneys worth. It doesn't get better.There are also several derogatory remarks about Southerners that I found to be in poor taste."
5,Awesome!,"I got a free sample of the art sticks, in my colored pencil box. I used it and liked it so much that I bought a whole set. They work great!"
5,prismacolor art sticks,I do alot of colour pencils drawings and these colour sticks are great! The colors are beautiful & easy to overlay colours for special effects. Great for artists of all ages.
4,Good Art Tool,"My son learned about these color pencils in his art class. They are ""naked"". Just the color, no wood surrounding them. I went to purchase some at the local craft store, and they were nearly $50. The ones I looked at were bigger, the size of a carpenters pencil. These are smaller, probably half the size. But for the price difference, we are happy with them."
1,Doesn't Work?????,"I assumed I could just plop it in and watch the movie...but No? I put it in and something pops up called ""SpinWare""??? It gives me two options ""Cancel"" and ""Activate SpinWare"" I click 'Cancel' and nothing happens, I click 'Activate SpinWare' and it takes me to something called 'ADV FILMS'. It give me a choice between 'ADV USA' and 'ADV UK', I click on 'ADV USA' and it says 'The page cannot be found'. And that is the extent of my viewing pleasure. This Sucks!!! Can anyone help me???"
5,"By Mothras great wings, this is the best monster movie ever!","This is the greatest monster-movie-epic-battle ever!!! As the golden scaled King Ghidorah returns to Earth, the Kilaaks enslave a bunch monsters to destroy the world!!! Featuring the Big-G, Rodan, samurai warrior of the skies, Mothra, the giant, winged goddess, Anguirus, the giant, spiky-shelled reptile, and a handful of others (Baragon, Gorosaurus, Minya, and others). This is the greatest Toho/Godzilla picture ever!!!!! Every G-Fan should have this movie sitting on their shelves at home!! LONG LIVE GODZILLA!!!!!!!!! Gravity beams and radiactive rays flying everywhere, whirlwinds and super-strong gusts of winds flinging everything everywhere, and a dozen monsters make this an awesome movie (And a heck of a lot better than Godzilla '98!)!!!!!!!!!!"
5,MOVIE REVIEW,"This is a good old fashion, knock down fight between the best of the best. This movie was supposed the be the last of Godzilla movies for awhile but i can see why it wasnt. Great script, and the acting was better than usual."
3,Three stars for Godzilla is the best i can do,"There are movies then there are Godzilla movies. While personally i find a facination with Godzilla movies i cannot bring myself to tell people they are 5 star works of art. This one is typical of the Godzilla films of the era (pre 1985). The sci-fi story behind the monsters attacking the world is the good part of this one and most of the Godzilla films. You get alien babes, space flight, and cool weapons to fight giant monsters. Keep in mind that in Godzilla movies, nothing is to fantastic to be true. Just go with it and enjoy."
4,"nice picture, great movie","This is the international dub of this fun film. ADV released it several years ago. It is a barebones DVD, but the picture is great and for the price it's worth it. the best part about this DVD is that you get the soundtrack CD along with it as a bonus. were you to buy the CD separately from Japan it could cost $40 or so, if it was available at all!It's too bad the AIP dub is not available, as that would make this even better."
2,"Great movie, bad presentation.","Shame on the producers of this dvd! It is an insult to the fans of this film to present such a horribly re-dubbed version on an inferior dvd. The widescreen picture looks good, but that is it. The voices sound ridiculous, a lot worse than the AIP version that the viewers have known for thirty years. If you can find that version anywhere, go for that one. This is almost unwatchable! I only give it 2 stars out of respect for the film."
2,"Destroy all Monsters, I think they mean Destroy this DVD!!","WHAT!! No Extras!! Now don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but that isn't the reson I rated it **. Heck, it doesn't have a menu, or a scene selection! What a way to spoil a good movie. That stinks! Buy it on video, even though it is no different then the DVD! But at least the video has previews/trailers before the feature."
3,Fun movie -- very bad dubbing,"For the 50th anniversary of Godzilla, we have a special relelease of Destroy All Monsters on DVD. This in itself is good, and an added attraction is that there's a second disc -- a CD of the soundtrack. But there are two downsides:-- there are no special featuers -- not even a theatrical trailer.-- the dub is the poorly acted recent dub from a few years ago. The original dub is not great (what dubs are? Why, oh, why, don't they also offer subtitled versions), this one is very poorly acted, more so that usual even for these types of films.Overall, I'd still recommend this to Godzilla fans (and I've been one since seeing King Kong vs. Godzilla in its original US showing at the drive-in when I was a kid), but it could have been so much better."
2,The Kobayashi Report,"Normally I like movies like this, but this one really wasn't too interesting. But at least it didn't go to waste. I gave it to someone who did like it."
4,An all MON-STAR cast!!!,"This movie is one of my favorites! Lots of monsters, a decent story (for the genre,) and lots funny cardboard buildings and toy tanks. My only complaint is that I wanted some of the monsters to have more screen time. When will the makers of these movies realize that all audiences want is a good monster fight and a few useless characters to trample!?! Does anybody seriously watch these for the story-lines!?!"
3,Defective disc alert,"I was really looking forward to this Godzilla classic. It arrived today, and I settled down to watch it. 34 minutes in, the disc paused for a couple of seconds, accompanied by a strange sound. Then again about 8 minutes later. From there, the disc continued to pause, freezing the action intermittently until the end. Two pauses I could cope with, but not this many.I looked at the reviews on Amazon and noticed another customer with exactly the same problem.Reluctantly, I am returning my disc for a refund. It's an huge shame, because the print is lovely and the sound is nice and full. I sincerely hope Tokyo Shock will rectify this fault, as I would buy it again.So, I would recommend this, but only a corrected pressing!"
3,Nostaglic. Campy Toho Godzilla 70s feel fun. Recommended,"For fans of the Toho monster (Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, King Gidorha) franchise this is a must see. 70s feel hopeful and dubbed and Americanised this is a fun look back for those fans of the era. Love the rubber suits and toys and minitures."
3,50th anniversary???,"Since Destroy All Monsters was released in 1968, we aren't 50 years after that date. I should know, it's the year I was born!!! So this ""50th anniversary edition"" is just a bit premature. Unless they mean Godzilla's 50th birthday but it doesn't specify that.Anyway, always loved this as a kid. I kept seeing one version that cut the intros of the monsters and cut right to the rocket crew encountering the Kilaaks on Monster Island. Then my local station showed a different version that had the beginning but cut the big 4 monster destruction of Tokyo. Would be nice to have a complete version with both the English & Japanese dubs. Wish whoever did this with the original Godzilla film & a few others got their hands on this one."
1,True fans ignore this awful version!,"I remember back in 1998 when they re-released this on video, thinking what a great film it was. One of my all-time favorite Godzilla films as a kid.When I finally went to my local video store and rented it, I had a less than thrilled feeling. The version has been re-dubbed with new voices. As a childhood fan, my nostalgic feelings had been all but lost. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal but I refuse to support such a horrible edition of this movie. How would you feel if your favorite childhood cartoon had new actor voice as opposed to the original? I am sorry but it just is not the same. Man, I wish they would release the original version they used to show on Saturday mornings."
1,An exact duplicate of the original DVD Release,"I already own this movie but I bought this DVD hoping that it would have added a little something nice to the original A.D. Vision release of this DVD -- specifically CHAPTERS! That's right, other than the soundtrack disk this is the exact same one released by A.D. Vision already and they STILL did not add the chapter selection to this supposed ""special edition"". Why is this important to the disk? Well for starters if you choose to skip to the next chapter the movie starts from the beginning again. If you want to see a scene 40 minutes into the movie you have to actually frame advance the whole way or else -- you guessed it -- the movie starts over! The movie is excellent but the disk is awful."
2,Beware!!! A DVD release only for those that want to make fun of Kaiju films.,"This is a good Godzilla entry, but a horrible DVD. No chapters, no disc menu, no choice of Japanese with sub-titles. Also an incredibly inferior dubbing. Most dubbing of Kaiju films have voice actors that actually seem to have trained as actors. This voice work is horrible, and the writing of the English script is moronic. No scientist or astronaut speaks in single word sentences all of the time. This voice work and script seems to have been written specifically for the people at Mystery Science Theater. Very disappointed with the dvd."
4,Japanese SI at it Best,"I was very heppy when I found out that Amozin had this verision of Distory all Monsters. I have look around a lot of website and tried to get this verision only to fine, they no long had or discontinued it.This version is much more clearer then some of the one's that have come out and the sound and video are in sync. Not chop up. This is one of the best JAp, SI-FI movie that brings all the excitment of all the monsters into play to battle one common fo. The effect are good, all though the acting still needs some work but that is the the nature of Japanese acting whitch also add to make the monster movie so good. It not super serious, not overly redicquless and some things funny and silly, which give us some time to relax and free ourself from the real world."
2,BAD IN EVERY WAY -- BUT TRUE TO FORM,"Headlines scream: New York gets nuked! Moscow is melted! Tokyo is torn apart! Under the command of alien invaders, an army of cinema's most famous monsters declares war against earth! In a 50th Anniversary Special Edition, Godzilla and the gang (Mothra, Rodan, etc.) join up to fight a race of evil Moonwomen. Long unavailable, this widescreen edition is a blast, especially if you appreciate the fine art of cheeseball filmmaking a la the Japanese monster genre. See actors (?) in rubber suits and hear atrociously bad dubbing taken to the ultimate extreme. It all ends in a showdown with the three-headed dragon King Ghidorah."
3,"Not bad...but, not one of the best either","This Godzilla movie was good, however, i would have to say, not one of the best Godzilla movies in my view. Not enough monster battles scenes and too much talk, the narration was lame, but, its the 70s what can you say and any good monster fights is toward the end of the film. This film is only for the ""hardcore"" Godzilla fans and a rental at best, but, other than that, its a fun movie to watch."
1,"Bad Sound on A.I.P. Dub, Mars Great Film","Just adding my 2 cents. I guess you could say I have been waiting since I was 12 to see (Picture o.k.) and hear one of the best dubbing jobs ever done on a Godzilla movie. No luck here. As a long time film collector, I immediately noticed the audio problem. The film was too loose on the sound drum, so it slipped and wavered. This caused that horrible and amazingly distracting problem. WOW! how UN-professional can a company get? If you want to pretend you are in a junior high classroom and the teacher made a mistake in threading the projector, buy this Blu-ray. If you are expecting state of the art quality in picture and sound, forget it. ""It's the Monsters I worry about!"", amen."
3,Conflicted,"There was a few things I liked about this film and alot I hated.... Well hate is a strong word, but I was dissapointed to say the least. Although ""Destroy All Monsters"" features a ridiculous large cast of monsters, the amount of time they actually spend fighting is small and the fight is really one-sided. The main plot, which involves a crack team of commandos in a space ship?!? is pretty unintersesting and takes too much away from the film. If u want to see a Three-headed space Dragon get gang beat in a massive ground pound by practically every monster known to the franchise, this is that film."
4,"Great Godzilla movie, but dvd has flaws!","The movie, of course, was great. So many monsters on screen at one time. It truly is one of the best Gojira pix to come out of Japan. The widescreen presentation on DVD preserves the integrity of the film. However, take note. The DVD has flaws! No main menu, no chapter stops, no theatrical trailer, no nothing! No bells and whistles of any kind! The least they should have done was to include chapter stops so you can go right to the action and jump past the cheesy dubbed dialog. Also, having no main menu means the movie plays over and over again until you press ""stop"". Stupid! The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of five is the way they put it out on DVD."
2,Buyer Beware!!! No free soundtrack CD!!!,"Contrary to what some reviews might say, this release of Destroy All Monsters on DVD does NOT contain a free bonus copy of the soundtrack CD! The only version of this movie that contains a free soundtrack CD is the 50th anniversary edition(the green and red case version), which Amazon.com also lists, with a slightly higher price tag. If you're a serious Godzilla fan, why would you spend your money on this edition, when for a few dollars more you can get everything you see here PLUS a free copy of the soundtrack CD? You can't beat that."
4,This movie is magnificent,"This movie has a powerful and moving musical score. The ""Main Title"" and ""Destroying the Remote Control"" are the two best ones. The monster involvement of Manda, Baragon, and Varan are brief, but it was good to see them in a movie other than their debut ones. The Killaks give a good performance that makes you think they really are evil. DESTROY ALL MONSTERS is Godzilla's ninth film and Toho's twentieth film overall. That's why it had such an enormous budget and a large but good cast of characters. If it was the 60's right now, I'd say that this movie would be hard to top."
4,Destroy all Monsters is the best,"All the Earth's kaiju are sent to Monster Island to live. Evil aliens release them and send them on a rampage. A must for any fans of old Sci-Fi movies. An all star monster cast. Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, Ghidrah, and all of your favorites. END"
5,Godzilla's Brilliant!,"Another Excellent G-Film, I got it for christmas and I watched it for ages, it has every monster. Godzilla,Anguilas,Mothra,Rodan,Baragon,Manda,Gorosaurus,Spiega,Varan,Minya and even Ghidrah.So buy it now!"
3,"Classic Godzilla, Bare Bones DVD","Hey, this is a Godzilla flick, right? You expect bad dubbing and horrible SFX. If you're buying the DVD though, be prepared... this is about as ""no frills"" as it gets. No menus, no extras, NO CHAPTERS!!! You pop it in, and it just starts playing. That's it. It's one big chapter. It's presented in widescreen though, which is a nice treat."
1,No Widescreen?,I can't believe the non-fans at ADVision put out a widescreen version on VHS but are butchering it to fullframe for DVD. Why would anyone ruin a perfectly wonderful Gojira experience?
2,Destroy All Aliens!,"The plot is the worst monster in the film. Had the monsters went loose without interference from the aliens the film would be a good half-hour multi-monster film. Although far from the classic atmospheric ""Godzilla"". For japanese monster fans only."
4,Still love the film......terrible commentary.,It was great to see this classic again. The commentary however was terrible. The authors ramble on and on with endless actor bios(this same problem plagued the Classic Media commentaries). I learned little about the movie.
1,What You See Is What You Get,"I am a self-confessed Godzilla fan and I am not ashamed to say that, and although that would probably make this review biased, I still have to rate this Movie with 1 star. Why? After getting my delivered copy of Destroy All Monsters and oozing with fanboy anticipation, and as soon as I pop it in the DVD player, the movie just started! Just like that! With no Special Features section or even a decent Chapter Selection, I have to say that they just made this into DVD format for the sake of making one half-heartedly. Although I enjoy the cheesy plot and the cheesy looking kaiju suits, I have to rate this rather low because it was a direct port from the 1968 film with no actual improvement... plus the voices! Very, very irritating combined with cheesy lines. Anyway, if you have an XBOX or Game Cube, I really, really, really suggest that you get a copy of Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee. A real bang for the buck!"
3,"Good, could be better","The final battle between ghidrah and the earth's monsters is the best part of the film but the monster scenes before that are not as good as i exspected. The part where the monsters attack the city is dull because mothra and manda sucked. It would have been better if it was godzilla, rodan,baragon and varan destroying the city.It would have also been better if gigan,megalon and mechagodzilla would have appeared for the first time in this film instead of the later godzilla movies so they would be able to fight alongside ghidrah, now that would be a hell of a movie."
2,Allways a good laugh,"All godzilla pictures are good for a laugh, except the one made in the US, they were more serious about it.I remember growing up on The Japanese ones, funny, they seemed better back then, but I supposed we have became more suffisticated with the modern abilities. Godzilla pictures are still good for a good laugh.Does anyone know why Godzilla 1985 is not available to DVD."
2,Unbelivable,"This film has a story that is nonsense, about Aliens called Kilaaks and they come to controll all monsters and take over the world. The Kilaaks where horrorable costumes. Godzilla acts as a friend, and the monster are nice. The only thing good in this movie is the destruction, there is every monster to date in that movie, only monsters from Godzilla series. And the film has good special Effects."
2,For those who want to reminisce of the old Godzilla days...,"It's been decades since I seen a real Godzilla movie and so, I bought this DVD to relive my childhood. Man, it's so campy... but it was fun to watch. I tried to read the actor's lips to see what they were actually saying in Japanese but anyway, it was interesting to see all the monsters together.I didn't expect much from the video and audio since the movie is so old but as for special features...no special features, just stick your DVD in and it plays. That's why the DVD is pretty cheap for retail. Anyway, if you are in the mood to see a DVD movie featuring the real Godzilla, this is it.I am giving this DVD a D for lack of anything on it but the movie an average C+."
5,buy this freakin movie,every toho monster is in this movie..its the last great godzilla movie of the 60's and should not be overlooked. buy this movie cause you won't be disapaointed at all if you have an imagination. believe me...if you are a yuppie then this is not a movie for you!
5,excellent action,Having all of toho film company putting godzilla and all the other monsters theycreated into one movie was in my view great.
2,sucks,"i am the worlds biggest godzilla fan, so i should know when a godzilla dvd is bad. and this just sucks. this has only the english dubb, (i like the original uncut vresions better) and this has the suckiest quality ever. i have every godzilla movie on dvd and this is not worth 50 bucks. maby 20, just because it is the best godzilla movie ever made, with godzilla 2000 being second best. so, if you want to try, go for it, but otherwise try the bluray disc version."
3,Revelation Time...,"I can not rate this book just yet, I just purchased it, but I loved Watch Me; and for all you Thomas Harris fans out there (of whom I am a dedicated one), you are not keeping up on your rumours as you type away in here trashing A.J. Holt; they are one in the same. Apparently A.J. Holt is Mr. Harris' pen name, and an outlet for his 'techie' side. If this is true, I'm fine with it - I enjoy the Holt and Harris books quite a bit. If not, I can't wait to read more from the individual A.J. Holt."
3,a disapointing sequel,not up to standard of first book.. i had eagerly awaited the sequel.seemed contrived.. also the editing was very poor.. several glaring errors
1,Sloppy and Confusing,This sequel to WATCH ME has all the flaws of the original and none of the bounce. I hope the law of diminishing returns doesn't apply to future entries in the Jay Fletcher series.
2,Throw me (in the trash),"I couldn't put this book down - because I knew if I did, I'd never pick it up again. The characters were beyond believability, beyond stereotype, beyond hope. The only plot device the author uses is motion - moving the characters around-and-around, from location to location, until finally the book runs out of pages, or the reader runs out of patience."
2,Don't catch this,"""Catch Me"" starts out exciting and taut, but by the last chapters of the sequel to ""Watch Me"", it becomes easily predictable. To be honest, I have never read ""Watch Me,"" so I may be biased. What compelled me to this book was its beginning chapter. Holt provides a detailed premise along with the intriguing participants in the ""cat and mouse"" game--Jay Fletcher and Billy Bones, respectively. Those are the only cahracters that were convincing; everyone else, especially Fletcher's FBI agent partner, falters. Also, of note, is its climax. I don't want to give it away, despite the fact that it resembles something straight out of a horror- or serial killer- themed movie. If you're gonna read Catch me, then head to your public library and ckeck out a copy rather than paying five bucks for it."
3,Inconsistent,"Catch Me is about the hunt for a murderous anthropologist. It has parts where the story and the writing are tight, drawing the reader into the suspenseful search for a demon, and it has sluggish parts where the writing is mushy and the story is contradictory.Jay is likable, especially as an ex cop/vigilante. She's tough and flawed and still real enough to have a sense of humor. She's out to kill herself a killer.Billy Bones, the book's bad guy, is pretty much that. He's your dime-a-dozen mainstream fiction killer, which a PhD in anthropology and a fixation with the Manson family doesn't make very interesting."
5,"A science fiction, occult, mystery roller coaster ride","All of Chesbro's ""Mongo"" books have a quality that make them impossible to pigeonhole. This one combines all the characteristics that make the Mongo books so engrossing and irresistible. The matter-of-fact dialog between Mongo and his brother Garth, about the most outrageous situations, made me laugh out loud. There's a bad guy who has a vision of how to save the world through reverse genetic engineering. Many of the story ideas have shown up in other media AFTER this book, including Star Trek: the Next Generation, Jurrassic Park, and X-Files. Treat yourself and read this book."
3,it's not as bad as they say!,"I think Catherine Clark did a good job creating a summer for the MSCL characters, and I actually found what she came up with pretty believable. After all, I think it makes perfect sense that Angela would work at her dad's restaurant, Rayanne would not be able to hold down one steady job, and Sharon would STILL sleep with Kyle, even after promising herself she wouldn't. Okay, so what happens with Brian is a little out there (I won't give it away!) but come on, the poor guy deserves some adventure. All in all, I enjoyed this continuation for the MSCL crew."
5,One of the finest live albums I've ever heard,"Rory Gallagher's ""Live in Europe"" ranks up there with the greatest live albums in rock music. It's certainly in the same league as The Allman Brothers ""Live at the Fillmore"", Frampton Comes Alive and The Who ""Live at Leeds"".From the first song 'Messin' with the Kid' Rory's guitar comes out swinging. Backed by excellent bass and drums, this power trio delivers rock-n-blues at its best. Another fine highlight is Blind Boy Fuller's 'Pistol Slapper Blues' a Rory Gallagher favorite. Perhaps no song among in this fine collection shows just at what a high level of playing this trio was capable of than 'Bullfrog Blues'.If you've never heard Rory Gallagher before prepare to be pleasantly surprised. One warning, other Rory Gallagher albums-studio and live- are, in my humble opinion, of equally high quality. You'll want them all.Highly recommended!"
3,Not what was expected.,After hearing a lot recently about Rory I went by the other reviews and took a chance on this album. It was weaker than I expected without very much oomph. I wouldn't recommend it to those that like hard British type rock and roll. Listen to some of Rory's stuff on youtube and keep a list of what you like then go looking for some compilation that is close.
5,"To repeat, this is a wonderful qigong practice","This DVD definitely offers the real stuff. Master Hu's approach to Wild Goose QiGong is somewhat gentler and softer than some other teachers' practice of the Wild goose forms, and word has it from a friend who attended one of his seminars that Hu relies on standing meditation practice (Yi Chuan) to supply much of the internal power which is channeled and refined in forms like this. But there is no mistaking the man's skill and focus."
5,Excellent video,"Dr Hu is a good and generous teacher. These exercises are an excellent introduction to qi gong, although it is always better to go to a class."
3,Moderately Loud,"I own a light Nissan Truck, and it was originally equipped with a pathetic horn that would only draw attention if blown in a Library. After some research, I decided to purchase this horn.It has a high quality sound, but it's pitch needs to be a little lower, and I actually think it is slightly underpowered. I had anticipated scaring people, but only those in a convertible would be annoyed. Perhaps this is a good thing, for I didn't really intend to use the device as a sonic weapon.This horn may actually draw a few grins, because it is more appropriate for a watercraft. I'll probably leave it in, but I wouldn't install it in a truck again."
4,Great buy !!!,"Walter E. Poole Jr. says:I just got my air horns today and installed them on my Honda Goldwing man what a difference, they are the the best thing that could come along for us bikers. Now when they act like i`m not there and pull in front of me or try to change lanes on me a short blast of these horns and they get out of the way. I actually get respect on the road now. GREAT BUY !!! I told all my friends where i bought them."
4,satisfied,"I mounted these on a Goldwing Motorcycle, and it really got the attention when it was used, lots better than the beep-beep I was used to."
5,love this book!!,"I have always loved the story, ""The Ox-Cart Man"". I bought this book so that I could share it with my son. We both enjoy it very much. I would recommend it to all!!!"
5,I love Oxcart Man!,This is a wonderful book about earlier and simpler days when a family wasted nothing and supported themselves off the land. Each member of the family contributes and their activities change as the seasons do. It's wonderful!
4,Entertaining in a peaceful way,"Gave this account of a year in the life of a farm family to my 2-1/2 year old grandson. Worked, because the first time he asked his father to ""read it again."" Appealed to me, since it shows a natural cycle of growing/making things, selling them, and starting over. We may not operate quite this way, but it may still provide understanding of the world to a youngster. Appealing pictures, peaceful telling - perhaps the most ""exciting"" event is the farmer kissing his ox good-bye at market. Maybe a good bedtime story."
4,How a farm changes with the seasons,"This children's book, about nineteenth century New England farm life through the changing seasons, was illustrated by Barbara Cooney and won the 1980 Caldecott Medal for best illustration for a children's book. The book shows what we get from the earth and how we grow as a family. It also can lead into a discussion of 19th century history."
4,Gilded Cage,"Published during the Reagan era, this compendium of rarely reproduced Victorian commercial art, snippets of period advice columns and brief biographies, is a sentimental treasure. Its layout and choice of typeface reflect an 1980's sensibility but the facsimiles of idealized and highly corseted women give the viewer a peek into the unconsciously erotic fashions of long ago. A good gift for covert Victorians, collectors of advertising art, or hoarders of feminine things."
4,Excellent Resource,"Jeff Wignall's Kodak Guide to Shooting Great Travel Pictures is an excellent resource, especially for beginners. The tips and ideas offered in the guide can greatly improve the quality of that travel photo albumn. In addition, the high quality photos within the book make it a joy to read. While not as thorough as the National Geographic Photography Field Guide, the Kodak Guide is more concise and more convenient for someone who lacks the time to read a big book on the subject of photography. Overall, this guide offers great value, knowledge, and enjoyment as an introduction into the improvement of photographic skills."
3,Nice book for tips... Not technical,"I love technical books; so I bought this book looking for some technical advices on ""how to"" take pictures when traveling: landscapes, low light conditions, using flashes, etc. When received the book, I found this is not a technical book, in this book you can find useful ideas and comments about ""what"", ""where"" and ""when"" to take nice pictures when traveling. I recommend this as a nice and ""light"" book to read written in an easy way to all kind of readers."
4,Gave me some good ideas,"This was the first photography book that I bought because I was going on a trip to Barcelona, Spain and I thought that I could use some ideas or suggestions on how to make my pictures better. I read this book cover to cover after first looking at the beautiful color pictures which gave me some inspiration for what I could try to do.The book is broken down into specific tips for things you may encounter while on a trip like rainbows, stained glass, landscapes and also general tips at the end. I would say that the information was useful because my pictures were better overall. I don't know if this is the best travel photography book because I haven't read any others, but I would say that it is definately a solid start."
1,Amateur advice,If you are an amateur this book is OK. If you want more advanced advice and great pictures to look at there are better choices. The book is also very dated and needs an update to cover digital cameras.
1,Not the best choice in travel photography,"I have several travel photography books. This is the worst I've ever bought. Although it has many pictures, in my opinion, the text is very poor."
1,Spend a few dollars more and get a better book.,"This book is useful neither for review nor for learning from scratch. It seems to me that the only student who would benefit from this book is someone who knows precalculus so well already that he/she wouldn't need it. There are several other precalculus guides costing just a few dollars more that are much more helpful, and are of better quality to boot. (Some pages in this book just look downright amateurish, designwise). Do yourself a favor and skip this one; it's money wasted. I'm using my copy as a doorstop."
4,Required reading for anyone interested in urban politics,"A concise history of the legendary political scene in Hudson County from the Gilded Age to the administration of the author and Mayor, the late Tommie Smith, in the early 1980s. While the author does drift a bit towards the book's end in just mentioning as many supporters as he can (hey, he IS from Jersey City), this book is perhaps the definitive history of the mayoralty of Frank Hague and his defeat at the hands of John V. Kenny after WWII.If you even want to understand Hudson County politics today, this book is required reading. If you want to learn about urban politics in Industrial Age America, this book is a great start."
2,No flavor really,I returned this because it doesn't really have any flavor. Only a hint of butterscotch. I keep pouring more and more in my coffee and still couldn't take butterscotch.
3,movie was ok,The movie was ok. It was a low budget movie. I seen worse but I've also seen better. Jeff Speakman is still a good actor.
4,Running Red AM not PM,"PM Entertainment produced this pretty good action flick. The late Stanley Kamel is a good villian however there is no real feel of menace between he and Speakman. If you have a couple of hours to spend, I would check it out. It's the blond guy with the hotdog in the Mimi-Mart that steels the show!"
1,Are you kidding,"Any review for this movie that gives more than one star is by Jeff's BFFs. This really is terrible. If you haven't watched any direct to video in the last 10 years it will work for you. Otherwise - we don't care about the acting which is horrible, but the action scenes aren't even worthy of my Sony camcoder. Really, don't waste your money. Watch any JCVD, Seagal or Snipes movie - even terrible ones - and it is better than this thing."
5,So fresh and clean!,"Stash these around the house and you'll love the subtle, clean scent. Problem areas? Just twist open the top a little more for extra freshness. The name ""Crisp Cotton"" just says it all -- especially nice in the summer."
3,"Good price, difficult to use for NB-2L batteries","The price on this unit is less than a third of the original charger replacement for the NB-2L batteries for our Canon S45 (which is now nine years old), and it works. However, the batteries are a tight fit onto the detachable charging plate, and it requires a great deal of force to dislodge the battery once it has been charged. This raises concern that over time the stress of removal will affect the structural integrity of the batteries and/or the plate itself. Hopefully, they all will last until we get around to replacing the camera. FWIW, the original charger didn't stop working, it accidentally got left in a hotel room on a recent trip and somehow never turned up in the hotel lost and found."
5,Works perfect and inexpensive,"Works perfect. It charges canon BP-2L13 1200mAh in about 3 hours. The battery shows on canon HG-10 camcorder with the correct battery life as full after the charging is finished. The charger indicator keeps orange during the charging and turns into green after the charge is finished. It works really good for the price paid $10. The only complaint is that it is a little bit tight when inserting and removing the battery from the charger, but I can handle it. The camcorder on-body charger failed after about two three years and this charger lets me continue using the rechargeable batteries with the camcorder."
5,The Book of the Millenium,"This is truly an exceptional book that is worth more than its cost. Step by step it removes all the disillusionment that man has had of Creation in all these centuries. Every false conception is revealed and true Light comes to the fore as the explanations given in this book project a perfect picture of Creation as it is and always has been. To all this who get this book, it will be the shining light and guiding staff that will lead them out of all the present-day chaos. It is indeed my Book of the Millenium."
2,Faint Praise,"After listening through this in my office, I realise that I've found the perfect music to listen to at work. It's bland enough so as to not intrude on my concentration, yet poppy enough to not bore me to sleep. It's the perfect background music: it's there, I hear it, but it doesn't demand that I stop what I'm doing to really listen to it.This of course is faint praise, as no band wants to supply music to be piped in through elevators or over PA systems."
2,Now I know why they weren't successful.,"After reading for years how the critics thought Big Star was highly influential, I finally bought this 2 CD set. What a waste of money, other than satisfying my curiosity of who this band was. If this music was good when it was put out (and the public didn't buy it), it certainly has not withstood the test of time. While there might be something to what the critics saw in this band, it sure is not pleasing to my ears to listen to this crud. While this is not the first time I have wasted money on a CD, I suggest that you do not. There is so much good music out there, to waste your dollars on a favorite of the critics is a bad move in my opinion. YMMV"
2,Number 1 beats Radio City,"Big Star is like Badfinger: as the group membership changed, the results were lessened. Chris Bell's influence on #1 Record is sorely missed on Radio City. The first LP is a gem (think Badfinger's ""Wish You Were Here""), the second is a lump of coal (like Badfinger's ""Say No More""). As a newcomer to this artist, in part, due to overrated reviews, I can honestly say that I really didn't miss much back in the early 70s by not having experienced the music of Big Star. Had I heard #1 Record then, I probably would have been a fan; even so, I would have been disappointed by Radio City."
1,Big Star = Big Disappointment,"No, no, no, scratch that; massive disappointment.This is like listening to a garage band, with minimal talent, trying to cover songs by the Zombies and the Beatles, but unable to convey a sense of memorable melody &, at least in terms of The Zombies, stellar lyrics. And this man's voice, my god, this voice is on par with James Taylor in terms of it's degree of nerve clawing.Elliott Smith covered them, and for some reason they're cited as being insanely influential; HOW? This is nothing new, not even for it's time, not even close to be remotely original, and more importantly, not even close to being important.Give it up, geezers, it's just nostalgia calling when you claim this as the greatest rock album of all time."
2,There's a reason why Big Star never made it big,"Well, much touted for their oeuvre and pop innovation by critics, I just can't help feeling that most songs lack the last couple of hooks that make the songs catchy. You are always left feeling that it's just not good enough.If you are interested in pop history, and can get this compilation cheaply, then buy it. But don't expect to get moved."
1,One Star For Big Star,"Didn't even come close to meeting my expectations. Very generic sounding music and lyrics. Nothing unique at all, really. Flat music. They sound like a mediocre local band of twentysomethings that are doomed to play a pathetic hybrid mix of their own material and Journey covers at everybody's prom for the next fifteen years. Just because they were never discovered doesn't mean they were a great band. I think they weren't ""discovered"" for a fairly evident reason: they are WHITE BREAD and MILK flavored."
4,Heavier than you've been led to believe,"I don't care about lyrics. I just want the music to rock, and surprisingly, given all the Beatles-Byrds-Raspberries-etc. comparisons that the critics and reviewers make, Big Star can rock just as hard and loud as Aerosmith (yes, stupid thuggish Aerosmith, you aesthetes) when they want to, on songs like ""When My Baby's Beside Me,"" ""Mod Lang,"" and ""Don't Lie to Me.""And yes, as everyone else points out, they do have beautiful pop melodies in the tradition of the popsters listed above. But that's not all they're about."
5,You need this.,"I've never bothered to write a review before, even with albums I really like. Although, this Big Star album has to be one of the best records I've ever heard....& I've heard quite a few! It is really incredible. Great songwriting, great guitar playing... a really fun, turn it up & have a good time record. It has some really good rocking tunes, & some mellow tunes, but they're ALL really, really, really good. Everyone should own a copy of this CD. That's it."
5,A Masterpiece/ A True Gem,"Anyone who has listened to this double-CD diamond does not need to be told again of Big Star's genius. Anyone who hasn't heard the band should do themself a favor and buy this. No matter the cost, it is worth every penny. While ""#1 Record"" is outstanding (no one has ever captured adolescent romance as well as Alex Chilton did in ""Thirteen""), I personally think ""Radio City"" is the better album; it is certainly one of the five greatest rock records ever made. What cements its greatness is the five-song mid-section of ""Mod Lang"", ""Back of a Car"", ""Daisy Glaze"", ""She's a Mover"" and ""September Gurls"". Taken as an album ""side"", it is one of the best ever crafted. In a perfect world, ""September Gurls"" would be mentioned with as much reverence as ""Satisfaction"" as the greatest rock song of all time."
1,Shoddy reissue of classic music,"This rating is not any reflection on the quality of the music, but of the presentation. This is a wholly unnecessary reissue, with no new cover art or liner notes. Two bonus tracks are included, one of which has already been on CD on a couple of compilations. The only previously unissued on CD track, the US 2:47 single edit of ""O, My Soul"" is the only reason to buy this. Worth it? I don't think so. Save your money for Rhino's Box set, coming in September. It will be money far better spent."
2,What the---?!?,"I've heard all the praise of Big Star for years but never came across their LPs in any record store. Now that I bought their CD I can't figure out what all the hype is about.There must be something I'm missing, because this sounds like a pretty pedestrian imitation of a Steve Marriott record. I've always heard the songwriting on Big Star records was great, but short-sighted ditties like ""The India Song"" leave me wondering if I'm listening to the same record as those reviewers.Big Star left me completely underwhelmed."
3,"Some genius, some throwaway, great overall look at Big Star","Big Star is one of those bands that had some amazing music, some of it was way before it's time. When you listen to this double-album collection, you'll hear tracks that sound perfectly contemporary today. You'll also hear where Wilco got a great deal of their sound. Unfortunately, you'll also hear a fair amount of just decent tracks, and you'll also get a lot of tracks that just aren't very good. There is a lot to love about Big Star, but honestly, I would start with buying individual tracks first as downloads, then if you still need more Big Star, come back and buy this."
5,People need to realize the importance of bands like Big Star,"These albums are excellent, the songs are well-written, well-produced, and a joy to listen to. It's a shame that this band doesn't get the credit it deserves. The beautiful pop songs on these albums are flawless and they've spawned many more beautiful pop songs by many more bands who were influenced by this stuff. You can find a little Big Star in some of the pop songs of today."
4,This ones a name dropper,"I found Big Star because more and more of the bands I listened to, cited them as a major influence. Elliott Smith and Jeff Tweedy have both been known to cover Big Star songs in concert.#1 Record came out in '72/'73 and Radio City came on its heels. Both were way ahead of their time. As far as rock history goes this CD is an important one.By the way, the theme song for the Fox TV series That 70's Show is the Big Star song In The Streets."
3,It's a bummer...,"that I didn't hear of these guys sooner! This is a great album with great dynamics. I can easily listen to it in it's entirety in one sitting. Like many other reviewers have said, ""Introduce someone to Big Star!"" You'll be doing them a huge favor!"
5,one of the finest classic rock records ever,"Although Big Star has not blown up to the extent of the likes of Led Zepplin and Cheap Trick, they certainly should have. Note, this is pure revisionist theory, ""Radio City was released in 1974, the year I was born. An esoteric and dedicated following would later buy Chriss Bell's solo album like GBV fan's later would buy the Tobin Sprout solo album. The point is this - anything new that could come out of such a great band has to be good. Big Star was so good that they have a fan base that will last for generations and that continues to grow."
4,Good Pop,"Big Star was never big, but there first and second album, combined on this single disc, is great pop music. Badfinger did it better and sold more albums, but Big Star never got the recognition they deserved with the jangling guitars and beautiful harmonies. A great album that belongs in every collection and the remastered disc sounds great."
3,Good background information,The book provides some interesting historical informaiton and background but not really the guidebook I was looking for. The information is so dated and you can't be sure if it's correct.
1,needs better strap locks,"The jewel lock on straps do not last. They wear down too quickly. I love the feel of the cup, but the straps don't hold. This would be a wonderful bra IF the strap locks didn't break."
2,Not very challenging,"I purchased this DVD because I have used other DVDs by Janis Saffell, i.e. strike zone and brand new butt. I really felt those two workouts the next day and I generally workout with very challenging DVDs (i.e. Cathe Friedrich, Jari Love, etc.). This DVD is definitely for advanced beginners. It really wasn't challenging. However, if you are looking for a well cued workout and a relaxing not too challenging workout, this is nice, but I was hoping it would work my abs more."
4,Good Humored Plus the Real Thing,"I was looking for a good read that would explore the special inner states of awareness found in martial arts. Sensei has it, plus a surprisingly wonderful humor, and a good tale to boot.I have been practicing awareness techniques for over thirty years with martial arts, meditation, and doing CranialSacral therapy. I hunger for the spirit in my fiction, not just kick-butt. I like the characters and the story keeps the pages turning. If you are hungering for the real world of martial arts, this will give you a taste."
5,What a page-turner!,"This is the first John Donohue book I've read. However I noticed there are two others in this series, so it won't be the last. I've read thrillers before, but this was the first martial art one I've read and I loved it! I'd love to see this turned into a movie. Five stars all the way!"
1,Don't Buy - Company Out of Business,"I got this for Christmas and was pretty excited as I read many good reviews. Now I feel robbed. The product has potential, but the motiontrack software is out of date, the website is perpetually broken, no drivers for Vista, no response from customer support, and no mention of the fate of the company. I am a little stunned how this product is still on the market as it will be a dead end purchase for everyone."
3,Best friend and...stalker?,"The Publishers Weekly summary on the information page sums up this story very well. The plot and characters are shallow, and the drawings are minimalist. ""Scratchy"" is a good description of the artwork style.I didn't care for the characters in this book. They were both selfish and shallow, and Minako was more like a stalker than a lovesick best friend. Her behavior was creepy, and her inner dialogue became almost disturbing by the end of the book.This could have been cute and sweet if it had actually been about best friends falling in love like the book blurb implies, but stalker stories and catty backstabbing just don't do it for me."
3,Between the Sheets Review,"I am new to Manga, so I was recommended this by amazon after I had bought another book, and it looked female friendly so I bought it. After reading it, which took about a short 20 minutes, I was somewhat disappointed. I thought that there would be more of a story line, but there wasn't much of one. Had it been a little more in-depth as some other Mangas tend to be, I would have enjoyed it much more."
5,The Nexus of Rock & Film,"Crenshaw, one of the great musicians of the last 30 years, is a man of many talents. Songwriter, guitarist, singer-- and author. Clearly a lover of rock'n'roll movies, both the good ones and the bad ones, he's assembled a group of equally dedicated friends and put together this fairly comprehensive paean to the form.I've had it for 15 years or so and I end up checking it all the time-- even if you haven't seen the films, it makes for amusing and informative perusing. Recommended."
1,Doesn't fit my Pinto engine,"Bought this baised on fitting a Pinto engine..... It doesn't fit,,, not even close. The enging has 8MM wires and these are lots smaller. Gonna get some at a local parts store. Watch out when you are ordering."
2,Autumn Leaves Stan Getz,The physical CD was in good condition. I was very dusappointed in Stan Getz's performance of Autumn Leaves and the other selections on this recording. It seemed as if he was in a big hurry to finish this gig.Frank Consolo
1,Not a Tablet PC stylus -- Misleading,"I have a Toshiba Portege M200, this pen does not work with it. I suspect this is a stylus for a Toshiba PDA; however it does not work with the M200 (and I would therefore assume it does not work with any other Toshiba tablet with the Wacom digitizer)."
1,Reserve Pen not for Toshiba M7 Drawing,Bought this pen for drawing on the TOshiba M7 Tablet. Pressure sensitivity didn't work. In fact it was inverse. Do not recommend for Toshiba M7 Tablet Drawing.
1,Table Pen ?? NOT,I asked for the Toshiba Tablet Pen ... I gave the model number and everything .... what was sent my be a tablet pen but is so small it does not stay in my tablet... a waste of my time and money ... sorry I bothered
1,my fault,"I should never order anything I can't read about! I have some of the original Himekami cassette albums released in the US, and really enjoy them - Moonwater, Snow Goddess and Voyage to Zipangu. On Moonwater, Mahoroba is a favorite - a beautiful song. Anyway, I took a chance with this, and lost! Surely the shortest CD I ever had, and the music, with choir backgrounds, is so different to what I was used to with Himekami, that it was quite a shock. I won't do that again."
5,smooth landings,Well written. Eash to understand. Good detail. Provided information that was not provided by my instructor.
5,A true revelation,"Wonderful and compelling music! I bought this CD for these holidays andhave to say that i'm happy to get it. Fry seems to me as a great orchestralpainter and creator of wonderful atmospheres in a pre-strauss way. He soundsas an avant-garde composer, considering that he was born in 1.813. His tonepoems has a bit of schumannesque style but all of them have their ownpersonality. This is an excellent recommendation for new music explorers."
5,Indispensable,"The intense beauty of Art Pepper's music lives forever. This collection has many extra tracks not found on the separate Galaxy releases. The amount of music you get is almost overwhelming, but then so is the music itself. Art Pepper was the greatest!"
1,Doesn't block-out the light is very low quality material!!,My little 2 years boy is crazy about thomas & friends....his bedroom was decorated with thomas....but the Drapes is very low quality material looks like drapes sold at dollar stores for $3.99 no soft is like when you use ironing starch.... i left only 1 start because matching with the bedding!I used only one pair with denim drapes liner under to block-out light....because I opened- package the other set i send back to Amazon.I do not recommend this product ....and if your boy likes dark room to sleep do not buy!!!....I bought Pottery Barn THIN WALE Corduroy panels are excellent light material and block-out light!
4,almost great,good value for the price. i do wish they were a little thicker and/or heavier. a little too see through.
3,Good,I need to have the manual for the ratio of colored ink. The top of some was not tight so the whole package was Red.
1,VERY FRUSTRATING,I HAVE A NEW EPSON XP-400. INK ARRIVED ON TIME WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS. A CARD WAS FOUND IN THE BOX DIRECTED ME TO A WEB SITE FOR INSTRUCTIONS. I COULD NOT FIND MY MAKE AND MODEL PRINTER ON THEIR WEB SITE. PERHAPS MY PRINTER IS TO NEW ON THE MARKET. SO WITH A LITTLE SEARCHING I FOUND A CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE NUBER. I THEN CALLED THE CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER ONLY TO GET A RECORDING DIRECTING ME BACK TO THEIR WEB SITE FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. I THEN SPENT AN HOUR TRYING TO FIND ANY BUSINESS PHONE NUMBER FOR THIS COMPANY.
2,Not Completely Transparant,"I purchased the Refill Kit from Stratitec on Amazon. While they said the refill kit was compatible with my printer, they failed to mention that my printer cartridges could NOT be refilled. Once I got the ink, I found out I had to spend another $50 to buy refillable cartridges..."
1,No drill bits and new cartridges required,"Images and description show 4 syringes. I received 6. Reviews mention drill bits and plugs. I received none!No instructions were included. When I went to the Stratitec.com website, the instructions were that I needed to buy refillable cartridges. Extra $30. Why no update? The product description should be clearer."
4,Very easy to refill and quality is nice.,"This product is easy to use. You can get on their website to find instructions on how to fill your cartridge but you might want to test the holes in the cartridge to make sure it is the correct color before injecting the color. If I hadn't checked by putting a toothpick in to see, I would have put in the wrong color. The print quality is off at first but after a couple prints, it did improve. Your printer might come up saying that you are using a bad cartridge but I just ignored it and realigned the printer and it did just fine. If you a person who prints a bunch of pictures, I'm not sure if the quality would be great for that. If you're like me and only print papers, then this will do just fine.Overall, I feel this is a great investment. It will save you quite a bit of money. This kit was cheaper than buying two cartridges for my printer."
5,Works like a charm,Easy to use. Beats buying new. Pays for itself in one or two refills. I have enough ink for a couple of years.
4,GOOD VALUE,"GOOD VALUE.COULD USE ""WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS IN THE BOX INSTEAD OF JUST ON LINE.ONLINE INSTRUCTION SHOULD BE MORE SPECIALIZED TO ""YOUR"" CARTRIDGE.REASONABLE SHIPPING TIME."
2,No Printer compatibility,The ink system itself worked ok. There was very little instructions given. My Lexmark X4650 has a counter built into the printer cartridge which stopped it from working even when I had filled it with this ink system I bought from Stratitec. My recommendations to Stratitec would be to do more research for each printer they service as well as more indepth instructions. My recommendation to the buyer would be to investigate your individual printer indepth to make sure it will allow refills before purchasing an ink refill kit. Thanks Ken
5,Inkjet Tnk,The product was everything I expected and the service was great'The ink was received with one yellow ink bottle leaking and when I calledthe company they replaced the leaking ink with a new bottle.
2,No instructions and doesn't work for my printer,I can't say anything about the quality of the ink because I couldn't print with my printer (which takes HP564 cartridges.) The details about the product say that it will work with most 4 color cartridges but doesn't actually say which printers it does and does not work with. Furthermore there are no links to the website where you can find out whether it works until after you've already purchased the kit. The kit includes a piece of paper with a link but no actual instructions for refilling. The website itself also doesn't seem to work very well. Overall it's a disappointing purchase and I plan to send the kit back.
1,Dont buy from this people!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased the Stratitec Inkjet Ink Refill Kit Model number: EIR595, as it is described in their product specs, and I got ""Nano Digital"" ink , some syringes, and real needles that look like something you get from a drug dealer! I have purchased the Stratitec kit before and this IS NOT it, not even close. Im very mad, and frustrated because I needed this asap, and that's why I paid extra money for faster shiping but thats not all, after I tried to explain them that this is not what they advertise, I got an e-mail from them with this ""if you like order a Stratitec kit, you need go to Stratitec kit store. Thank. Dinsink"" I mean what is that???"
4,Great gift!,"I bought this set as a housewarming gift for my father. I did not get to feel the weight and see the flatware set so, I was bit concerned. However, my father loved it! It is a nicely weighted set. It feels like you are holding a heavy duty piece when it in your hand. This set has a nice pattern too. The hostess set is definitely a nice bonus.The one drawback to this gift is that the flatware pieces are huge. I do not think that they are made to fit in human mouths. The teaspoon is the size of a tablespoon in other sets. The fork tines are extremely long too. This is definitely not a good set to use with children.Once you can wrap your mouth around this set then you will love it. The price is definitely a good value."
2,disappointed,"this is my second lebanese cookbook purchase. I purchased this one on the basis that included a variety of recipes. But what left me disappointed was that the recipes/directions were not complete or as detailed as needed to be. Quick written, unreviewed."
5,My mother would love it.,Best book I have seen on authentic Lebanese home cooking. I can still hear my father telling me how to judge the temperature of Laban using ones little finger. It's a Classic! The only real problem with the book is finding it.
1,Not 21st century lebanese food,Having lived in Lebanon for many years this cookbook is not even close to a good representation of the wonderful food available in the region. If you are looking for a Lebanese cookbook this is not the one to recommend; the recipies are generic and do not explore the region.
5,"Exactly what you expect, but a little nicer","bought it for our 2-yr-old niece, she uses them with her castle and loves them, durable and look good"
5,Sandra Brown's best,This is my favorite of SB's books. The undercurrent of passion and heat keep you on the edge of your seat. Buy it today.
2,Heat Fizzles,"I'm sorry but I did not find this a suspenseful story at all. Very predictable and not one of the pathetic characters was worth liking. Nothing that was revealed surprised me in the least. What a bunch of lying, cheating, money grubbing people starting with Cotton and working all the way down to the swampy bottom of Jigger's world. What will Schyler do next? Run for office and clean up the so called law enforcement maybe for starters and I understand there's an opening at the bank."
3,One Problem With This Book,"Good story and I enjoyed it, but I felt Cash Boudreaux was extremely crude and this took away from my enjoyment of the character. At times it was difficult to even like him."
5,slow heat in Heaven,This was an excellent book.! Once I began reading it I could not put the book down. I totally recommend this book
5,Hot and Humid As the Deep South,"The very best of Sandra Brown. I've read this book many times but lost my copy during a relocation. Even though I know the story well and can recite my favorite passages by heart, I have to have a physical copy in my library and read it again every so often. Yes, it's that good. Her villians are so slimy they practically ooze. Her hero is steamy enough to make a woman sweat bullets. The heroine is just right; neither too naive and innocent nor too worldly. The story is facinating and intense. Even after multiple readings, when I start into it again I still can't put it down."
5,My favorite Sandra Brown,I read this when it first came out. I'm getting back to reading and reread this again. Loved this book and am keeping it! Great story about Louisiana - contemporary romance. Wonderfully paced and very sensual. She does wonderful character development.
3,Not bad...,"This was a weird book to rate for the simply fact that it was extremely interesting in parts, but dull in other areas. The romance between the the hero and heroine was not very strong on a whole. The chemistry was there, but it was devoid of substantial interactions between the leads. I was captivated by the story-line however. The Cajun flare was very unique. The hero was a nasty piece of work that kept things lively. I wasn't so sure of this book in the beginning because the heroine came off as TSTL with some of the things she did. I almost gave it 2.5 stars, but the ending saved it. It definitely grew on me. I appreciated the fact that everyone that was evil got what was coming to them. No one got off Scott free after their evil deeds, thank goodness. Not a bad book, but not as great as I was expecting either. This was my first book by Sandra Brown and I might try another."
2,Hero More Like Super-Villain,"I can't believe so few people have mentioned Cash's comment about rape!!! Cash is definitely NOT the type of hero I go for, but I was able to tolerate him until he made this comment to the heroine (and I quote) ""I should have raped you when I had the chance!"" WHAT?!?!?! If he had said that to me, he would've gotten a kick in the family jewels. After that comment, I set the book down & was very tempted to get rid of it. I couldn't believe the HERO would make a comment like that. He's an alpha male, yes.... but that statement crossed way over the line.The only reason I give this book 2 stars instead of 1 is because I find the setting to be very interesting."
2,Don't waste your time!,"I bought this book because of the great reviews, but I have to say this book was awful and a waste of time to read! I kept reading thinking it has to get better, and it didn't get that way until the last chapter (of course). It was very depressing to me to read about so many characters who had such selfish and mean personalities (except for the one main character, Schyler) and were horrible in the way they treat one another. This whole book had nothing but abuse and unkindness through the entire thing! This was not a ""romance"" on any terms for me - but that is my opinion. Choose one of her other novels instead - like Bittersweet Rain!!"
2,GRrrrRr... HATE the hero in this one,"i really hated the ehro in this novel. He was an ass pain and simple. If he was so in love with her why's he kiss her sister near the end of the book (sorry for giving thatpart away). I mean if he's gonna behave that why each time they have a fight then he's not trust worthy. Throughout the novel he was a plain ass. (...) But you ppl. might be into all that stuff... I dunno... lol. I wont recommend this book... i thought it would be good and i was greatly disappointed ;^( too bad eh. But dont take my word for it, go out there and get the book and make ur own minds about it. I'm 91.999% sure by the time you finish the book (if you even get that far through it) you'll agree with my argues. Till next time."
2,Was she depressed when she wrote this?,"I have always liked Sandra Brown's work, but this was so depressing, I couldn't finish it. I just skimmed the last 85-90 pages to see if anything good happened!! It never does!! Every character is nasty and hateful and it's just one horrible thing after another."
2,Early Sandra Brown,"Skip this one if you are looking for realistic dialogue. Read it if you want a good old fashioned smutty romance novel with a little intrigue thrown in. Sandra Brown's most recent novel, ENVY, was a 5 star book all the way. Slow Heat in Heaven is an inside look at a disfunctional southern family with heavy sex dialogue that doesn't add much to the plot; but it is pretty much the plot. Fortunately Sandra Brown gets better with each book."
2,Revolting hero!!!,"This book had the most repulsive, revolting hero of any romance novel I've ever read. Not once did he have a nice, pleasant, kind thing to say to the heroine. He treated her like dirt from beginning to end, until the last sentence in the book, when he unbelievably says, ""I love you."" Cash was a misogynist, cruel creep, and Schyler was a pathetic doormat. Her love for him made no sense because, other than his economically and emotionally disadvantaged past, there was nothing about Cash to make him even slightly sympathetic, let alone worth loving. I know this book was written 15 years ago, but I am appalled that even then, this author would have thought that a woman should love a man who treated her this abusively. I can love an alpha male as well as the next woman, but even an alpha male should have respect for the heroine, which Cash did not. Their relationship was sick, and should not be used as an example of what a romantic relationship should be."
3,Running out of ideas.,Its still good but it needs new and fresh ideas. It also needs some better non rehearsed dialogue especially his brother Rick's role.
3,Historic Performance,Nice performance by Martzy on some pieces I didnot have on other issue. I dont think Pommers had the synergy that existed between Martzy and Antionetti. Recording quality is fair. Not a must have
3,Not what I expected,Its for art therapists and is wordy. Wish I had read the reviews more closely because others said the same thing.
5,Wonderful,"I really enjoy this CD. I have been a fan of Midnight Syndicate for several years, and I look forward to each release. When I heard this CD was going to be a retrospective, I must admit I was a little disappointed as I was hoping for new material. I bought the CD anyway and it has exceeded my expectations.First of all, there is new material! There are four tracks that were previously unreleased, so that satisfied my need for something I hadn't heard before. Also, there are tracks from Midnight Syndicate's first release, which was self-titled and which I hadn't heard before - so that was new to me, too!Second, I very much enjoy listening to how the tracks have changed from when they were first released on ""Born of the Night"" and ""Realm of Shadows"". They seem to have a bit more depth - to be more finely tuned than they were before, but not changed so much that they're too different to enjoy if you liked them the first time around."
5,Great way to start your Midnight Syndicate collection!,"Since I don't own any of this band's CD, I figured this one would be a great choice to become aquainted with them since it has songs from their other CDs.If this CD is any indication of what their other music sounds like, I'M IN! I wish I'd heard of them sooner. My only problem now is trying to decide whcih CD of theirs to buy next."
5,A Great Compilation,"This CD is selections from Midnight Syndicate's work from 1994 through 1999. It gives you a great taste of what they offer in their albums, and the masterful work they do creating frightening locations and stories. Thier music if perfect for haunting your house for Halloween."
2,"fair, but not original.","There are some nice things to say about this album. It was actually the 1st ""gothic"" CD I ever bought at hot topic and listened to it right away.Now that I have several other pieces by different artists, I am noticing that there is something missing from this. A certain pizazz.... I like it, but don't listen to it much anymore."
2,where's the buoyancy?,"The novel celebrates the triumph of sweet lively spirits in dark times and places, while this DVD is a tribute to the power of a dismal tone to kill delightful dialogue, hilarious situations and charming characters. Look at that grim haunted face on the DVD case -- it isn't Ralph Nickleby, as I assumed when I bought the set, but this performance's version of sunny, irrepressible, boyishly earnest Nicholas. I like the script and production but the tone starting with Nicholas is just so pervasively wrong that I couldn't see it through."
4,The Next Best Thing,"I doubt if a filmed version of a play can ever produce the satisfaction of sitting in a theater as part of an engaged audience watching a wonderful drama unfold before ones eyes. Nicholas Nickleby was a unique theatrical experience. I am happy to have a record of it and the wonderful performances and creative staging that made it such a memorable day in the theater.The DVD would have been even more satisfactory if the audio had been more consistent. I found considerable fluctuation in the sound levels. Some of the actors dialects were also difficult to understand (how about subtitles?) I also would have appreciated a list of the names of the actors and the parts that they played somewhere on one of the DVDs.All in all, this is a keeper. A theatrical experience that was a joy to experience both first hand and through the DVD."
1,BEWARE! NOT uncut and NOT a Miniseries,"This was an historical theatrical event, performed onstage in one eight and a half hour performance or divided over two nights. It was not intended to be chopped up into nine episodes. The picture and sound quality are subpar and it was chopped up (padded in time by repeating opening and closing credits in every hour) without regard to the plot. And there ARE scenes missing. Don't reward A&E's buchery by buying this."
1,The Life & Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby-VHS,I'm not sure how good the production was because the audio was so terrible on 5 of the 9 VHS versions( a loud hum through the whole episode) I couldn't understand it. I am in the process of returning the set.
5,One of my ALL-TIME FAVORITE productions!!,"I was lucky enough to see this on PBS in the 80's and desperate to find it on video afterwards. I don't mean to sound dramatic, but I cried when I finally DID locate this set. Even if you aren't a fan of Dickens -- this production will enchant you....... Well worth EVERY penny!! Buy it! Buy it!!!"
5,Fantastic...Not to be missed!!!,"I first saw this production when it aired on KCET and I was hooked. When the production came to L.A. I jumped at the opportunity to see this magnificant show live. I opted for the whole day performance and I was stunned by the brilliance of the production. A few years ago I bought the Laser Disc of the production. Even though it's nine hours, I played the Laser Disc over and over. I have a portable DVD player and was lamenting the fact that this truly wonderous show was not available on DVD. Then I found it was!!!! I have been watching again and it brings back the sheer joy of great acting!!! I can not recomended this DVD set enough!!!!!!"
5,An experience not to be missed,"I saw the original broadcast years ago and was hooked then. When the VHS tapes came out, I bought them immediately and they are worth every penny. Yes, it's Dickens and it's funny, sad, moving, and melodramatic...coincidences abound as they can only do in Victorian novels..and even if you can't stand reading the books, you will love every moment of this. Be prepared to give up a few nights (willingly) to savor every moment. And by the way, it's finally out on DVD, too!"
5,Living on the Stage,"Ella Fitzgerald, lived on the stage singing in various parts of the world.This CD box was a perfect idea!It is a must!"
5,Good and detailed book,This is one of the better books I've read on the subject of database programming and in particular using the .Net framework. It starts off in a slow pace explaining the details of disconnected database programming and then chapter by chapter it explains how to work with ADO.net and it then rounds off with some 'extras' in teh form of SQLXML and Exchange Server connectivity. Really good book.
1,Can't Belive This,I can't believe I got this both books from this author. I was better off choosing MS Press. Unfortunately I am going to return them. Nothing there for serios database developers.
5,Good database book,"This book is nothing more than the best database book for VB.NET programmers. There is so much detailed coverage in this book it's unbeliveable. parts 2 to 5 are very good for learning ADO.NET and with the two appendixes this really is a reference must have for all serious VB.NET database programmers. I did manage to find a few typos and minor errors, but all in all this book truly deserves 5 stars."
5,I found the stories to be a delicious ending to my day.,"Miss Allenbaugh's beautiful book of stories is inspirational and written from the hearts of real women. The stories trigger so many memories that I had tucked away, but were forgotten. It is a book that I would feel comfortable giving to any woman in any profession and it makes a wonderful traveling companion. I would love to invite all the women who wrote for 'Soul' to one big slumber party with heaps of chocolate and story-telling. What fun!!!"
5,Worked perfectly in my 2000 Chrysler Voyager minivan,"This worked perfectly in my minivan, despite the fact that it is 2000 Chrysler Voyager and this is listed as fitting the Plymouth Voyager. There seems to be some source of confusion about the difference between the Chrylser and Plymouth models, at least in that year. My center console is the style with two HVAC vents above the radio, not three. I tried the Metra 99-6505 first, and although it was listed as appropriate for my model it did not fit at all."
2,Pompous and Boring,"This is a late review, as I read this book a few months ago. I had some trouble writing this review because although I didn't hate this book, I didn't like it either.Instead of being filled with flat, cardboard cutout characters, the people in this book are over-inflated, over dramatic, and pretentiously formal.As I've said in other reviews of Ms. Kane's works, the story isn't bad. In my opinion, however, her characters drag the story down instead of speed it along. I had to work to get through this book. I wanted it to be over, but it took me what seemed like forever to finally finish it.Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"
2,Great Concept. Awkward Read.,"The story is clever and interesting. However, I wonder if the author has ever actually been to Manhattan? I also wonder if she actually has any close siblings or if she's ever actually had a conversation with someone. The exchanges mostly felt stiff and unrealistic. The descriptions and the dialog was so obvious at times, I kept wanting to say, ""Duh!"" right out loud (which tends to make people look at you funny on the subway...)."
3,Let's get real,"The beginning of the book is very good, you think that you will never put the book down, the fight of Victoria with her father, the way she found her sister the first time, the way she help married woman and the way she save her sister, all that part of the book was well written and you will never put the book down while you read this.BUT, the love story of Victoria with Zach is really very boring, it takes you out of the story so many times that you will want to leave the book, but the end of the book is very good...don't leave the book.What happened in the love story?...when a writer writes FOUR explicit sex scenes with the same couple (Victoria and Zach), for me, that is a signal that the writer doesn't have anything else to write and he or she wants to write many pages in the book..."
3,"Run for Your Life? More Like ""Match Wits for Answers""","From the title of the book and the other reviews I read, I was expecting a fast-paced thrill a minute story. Sad to say, I was disappointed. The plot of the story was fairly interesting and it kept me guessing as to what was going on at the Hope Institute. However, the only thrilling thing were the love scenes. I also felt that the characters were rather cliched."
1,This book should have been a lot shorter,"I read some good reviews for this book, so I was amazed when I read it how awful it is. I have to wonder if the author has ever heard or been part of a conversation, the way these characters talk is ridiculous. Throughout the book they all speak every option there is. It's as though the author wants to assure the reader that she has thought of all the possibilities and so have her characters.This book is 464 pages. If you cut down the conversations so every character doesn't speak every thought they've ever had, the book could easily have been under 400 pages and wouldn't have felt like 1,000."
3,Distant Shores,"The characters were like family and the plot was spell binding and very well written. Over all I loved this book and the whole series. The only problem I had and it became so big that I almost quite reading was the fact that the characters had these lengthy and numerous memory flashes of events that took place in the other books. It was told almost word for word from the other two books in the series. If you hadn't read the other books this is needful but if you had (like I just did) it is so aggravating! It's as though the publisher and or author thinks we will not remember anything. I found myself skipping ahead to a new writing. If you can handle that, read the book and don't worry if you haven't read the other two books in this series."
1,Save your money,"I purchased this for a cool effect on my rack as well as some light to see my mixer and cd player controls. First off it is VERY poorly made with a hand painted white stripe for the ""reflector"". For the color changer, when you first plug it in it will change colors but as soon as you hit one of the buttons it stops and goes to solid colors and you cannot get it to colorchange again automatically. There are no instructions either.. Also it did not fit in my rack with the cover on..."
4,Very nice - I feel like I'm on vacation,"I purchased this CD to use the sound effects as a backdrop for my podcast. it has just the right amount of tropical birds in the foreground and the rest of the jungle noise (rain, insects, etc) in the background. It really lends a nice tropical feel. I also plan on using this as a sound backdrop for a tiki party I will be having in my house soon. It should help my guests feel like they are in the tropics while they sip mai tais."
5,Redirecting Children's Behavior,"Out of all the books there are on parenting, this book not only shows the typical and atypical quandaries that come up with your child(ren), It gives options and concrete examples of how to deal with different needs, and types of children. I have 3 adult kids that I love dearly and I ask myself, How would my parenting have been if I had read this book 32 years ago? Very Different!"
4,helpful book,helpful. covers a wide range of topics. good real-life examples. a little fragmented. recommend.
3,Disappointed,I ordered this book after reading the positive reviews. When I read it I was disappointed. This book just doesn't contain that many good ideas. It's a lot of common sense. I am a fan or Ross Greene's books and also of Mary Pipher. This book just didn't do it for me.
5,Great service,"I was very pleased with the service...the book arrived the next day and was not even sent federal express. The book was in excellent condition and was a good price. Previously, I had purchased one from Overstock for my daughter and it took over a week to arrive"
2,Borders on being a toy.,"You can (and should) do a lot better than this in a digital camera at this price. It has a rather low resolution, a fixed focus lens, no zoom, and no USB connectivity. Anyone interested in simple digital photography will very soon be looking for a more advanced camera, while the SDC-80 gathers dust in a drawer. If you want cheap, look at the JamCams; if you want easy, look at the Sony Mavs."
2,Fans Only,"Censored ""bits"" of Lenny Bruce. His earliest work, but not nearly as great as he was to become. Has some great stuff but not really his best work. Get a live performance for the real reason people love Lenny."
5,the best bruce c.d.,"has the best: non-skiddo, religions incorporated, finding a dictator and ike and sherm. visit lenny's grave site-mt.eden memorial park,san fernando valley, califonia ""peace at last"""
3,1970s,what would you expect with a front cover like this? Its not gone with the wind or Casablanca for sure!
5,Bill Evans,"One of the best albums ever made. The ""last Recording"" in San F. (Berkley) is just as good."
5,As good as we expected.,"This is a remarkable work. We had heard about Evans and the respect he generated from his fellow artists, and the work shows why. Highly recommended."
4,A slight warning to jazz novices,"I'm a jazz novice. I picked up this album, my first Bill Evans disc, after hearing ""Blue in Green"" (from ""Kind of Blue""). Although I'm enjoying the album, I have a little problem: I'm not a big fan of the bass. I'm told that LaFaro was a genius; I'm sure he was, but personally, I don't really ""get"" this instrument (yet). Hopefully in time that will change, but since I only found out after purchase that the numbers on this disc were selected with an emphasis on LaFaro's role, I thought I would pass along a word of caution to other inexperienced listeners. That said, Bill Evans's piano playing is just great. I might try ""Waltz for Debby"" or one of his earlier albums. Or one of his solo ""Conversations""."
4,Generously preserved,Hallowed live recordings from a positively synergistic trio unfortunately plays out more in historical context from its scarcity of variety.
3,i just cannot understand why,"this CD arranges the songs the way it does. I love the sounds, the jazz, the piano, the bass, yeah all of that stuff is good and all, but why do I have to hear the same song twice in a row multiple times? Explain to me why there shouldn't be the six differnt songs (by title) and then the four repeats tacked onto the end so as to excite a ""Wow, yeah that was a great song, I don't mind hearing it again"" instead of a ""I just heard that song?""I reccommend getting a recording that doesn't do this. There are many versions of the music created on this legendary day."
3,Overrated and often uncoordinated,"Bill Evans is brilliant as usual. But LeFaro's bass more often competes with Evans than complements him. Very often they seemed to be playing two different works at once, resulting in a clumsy and tiresome mess. If you appreciate an improvisational feel, then you may care for this, but it too often feels more like ""random jazz"" than anything else. I far prefer the well orchestrated ""Everybody Digs Bill Evans."""
5,wow...,"I am completely floored that there are only a couple reviews for this classic. As the title of one of his earlier albums states...'Everybody Digs Bill Evans' I can't even say it's an acquired taste. Unlike single malt scotch, or dark chocolate, this hits you from square one. From the moment I heard it, I was like, 'ahhh...that's it!!' I don't claim to be a critic, but I've been blessed to recognize greatness. It's as if these 3 souls merged briefly, then scattered, forever. Bassist Scott LaFaro was killed in a car accident 10 days after these sets, but thankfully lightning has been caught in a bottle...trust me, this is up there with, 'Kind of Blue', 'Time Out', 'Birth of the Cool', or any of the other 'cool' or 'west coast' jazz greats."
4,"GREAT BOOK, helped my dad, got to openlibrary.org to borrow pdf one","its alright everyone, just go to open library.org and borrow the ebook pdf version, when there is no more paper, go digital!"
5,Masterful Storyteller,"In this slim volume of five stories, E.L. Doctorow captures a desperate vision of the American dream. Whether it's the desire for family, money, or faith, these are people who are living on the edge, and trying to find their footing. Unforgiving, yet hopeful, they're each a gem."
4,Nothing Sweet about these Stories,"I've read a few Doctorow novels, but was totally unprepared for these stories. They were fantastic, but not one of them sweet."
1,Do not buy it!!,"After using a few months , there are some crack on the handle.But They will not provide any warranty on that.I hope this case is only mine.."
4,True Cinderella blue,"If you are looking for true Disney colors, these are the ones. I made a Cinderella castle cake for my 3-year-old and the Cinderella blue was spot on."
4,Unique and special salt,"This salt was so much fun, and has a mellow but rich salty taste. It's more pink when you grind it out. It's a finishing salt, rather than for use in quantities while cooking. I loved it and need to buy more."
4,Sea salt review,This product adds alot of flavor to every dish I use it on.It also adds a little color.
3,Got Lava Salt instead of Alaea salt bummed,After reading the reviews on the salt I decided I wanted to make Kalaua pork for my husband to remind him of the 5 years we lived on Oahau. Bummed that I got Lava salt instead of Alaea salt. Amazon was great in crediting me for the wrong product but bummed I had to reorder and can't make the special dinner I had planned.
5,Yum,"I bought this salt and the black lava salt for my husband, who is the chef in the family. Both are delicious, with different flavors that are appropriate in different settings. He's having a great time determining all those settings, and I'm having a great time tasting his results.The salts came with a note from the company and a free sample of some candy; it was a very friendly and pleasant introduction to the company. They also arrived quickly, in plenty of time for the gift-giving occasion for which I needed them."
2,Fine if you're not actually stressed!,"I am a stress management instructor looking for some new ideas. I teach quick-fix techniques for people to calm themselves during their busy lives, and so this book attracted me. This book however is a jokey book, with one line per two pages, so you can read the entire thing in 2 minutes. It gives you ideas to distract yourself for a minute from what ever is causing your stressful reactions, like make a paper airplane and send it across the room, or name as many teams you can in a sport. Childish ideas if you want to have a bit of a laugh, but if you are actually looking for something to deal with serious stress overload this is not the book for you."
2,60 Ways to Relieve Stress in 60 Seconds,"Some of the suggestions would make me more stressed if I were to do them, but for the most part, it was interesting."
3,Helpful but basic,I found the book to be practical and it contained several helpful hints. It was a bit basic and did not seem to have any guidance for long term stress management.
5,Great new addition to romance,"I read this book this past weekend and, like all the other reviewers, loved it! The development of Georgeanne's character was especially good. At the beginning of the book, Georgeanne made me uncomfortable with her helplessness and manipulation, but she was great when she finally grew up. Same goes for the hero -- loved it when he played Barbies with his daughter.The only minor criticism I had with the writing was that so many of the characters looked like or reminded another character of someone famous; that seems like a lazy way to develop characterization. By the third time, I was irritated by the comparisons. Nonetheless, the first thing I did upon finishing the book was to search Amazon for more titles by Rachel Gibson. The author blurb makes it sound like she has written other books, but Amazon doesn't list any others. Anyone know of other titles?"
3,I enjoy Rachel Gibson but...,"I enjoy Rachel Gibson, but this was probably my least favorite of her books. It was a good read, and there were some tender and funny moments, but it seemed to me like the romance was wrapped up too quickly at the end. He's still thinking of Georgie as nothing but sex and then ... bam! He's proposing to her five pages later.Basically, I didn't think the relationship was well-developed at all. I found much to appreciate in Georgie, personally, although I had trouble liking her at the beginning. But it didn't really seem like there was any genuine emotional development between the two characters.However, it was a fun book, and it's obvious that many people enjoyed it very much. Heck, I enjoyed it. I simply think there are a lot better books in this sub-genre. Read Gibson's ""It Must Be Love"" instead."
1,Couldn't hold my interest,"With all the great comments I was hearing, I tried to read this book. I didn't like either of the characters. Especially thought the hero a jerk. I gave up after a few chapters. This is purely subjective, I realize. It just wasn't my cup of tea."
2,Waste of time,"Customers planning to buy this book, listen to the 1 - 2 ratings. It's an unsatisfying read. No romance at all between the hero and heroine. The hero consistently remained a jerk and the heroine a spineless woman!"
2,Integrity clearly not a concern,The hero is an ass. Fine. What I can't get past is the heroine's blithe decisions to lie to her daughter.
3,"Really a 3.5 - enjoyable, but had problems","Although I enjoyed this book (mainly for background to the series), it had enough problems for me to give it only 3.5 stars (rounded down to 3). The plot idea was okay, but the pacing was very uneven and ideas seemed to be regurgitated over and over. The relationship was shallow up until the very end, and was so on-again, off-again that I had trouble keeping up in spots. The weak relationship resulted in the happily-ever-after ending not being very believable. The reader never knows exactly when (and why) the hero finally fell in love with the heroine instead of just being ""in lust"" with her. Along the same line, it was difficult to understand how the heroine fell in love with the hero at all, much less in one day. I think this was the first book the author wrote - the others I've read by her are better, so don't give up if this was your first."
5,Great contemporary romance,"I love contemporary romance for the great stories, the wonderful characters, the humor and the fun and sexy storylines. I like Nora Roberts, Sandra Brown, SE Phillips, Susan Andersen and Linda Howard, but if I had to pick two favorite books, they'd be ""Simply Irresistible"" and ""Truly Madly Yours"" by Rachel Gibson. The one she wrote about the tabloid writer who moves to Montana is a close third. Her characters are people I would like to meet in real life -- passionate, flawed, principled and funny. These are really wonderful books."
5,My favorite Book!!,I love this book. The writer does a great job with making you fall in love with the characters. It's my favorite book!!
3,Cute!,"I liked this book. It's a good romance, but not too graphic, if you know what I mean. It's sweet and enjoyable. I always enjoy a Rachel Gibson book."
3,Resistible due to typos,"It is a quick, light read and a good price, however, the Kindle version has many typos which at times makes the story difficult to read."
2,Very unrealistic story line.,I did not like....needs better story line. A bride running from her wedding like this...really???? AND TMI on the romantic scenes.
4,Simply great!,"This book was right up my alley...romance, funny and a little sports thrown in. Loved the characters. I will read more from this author!"
3,Not a fave,Got tired of the macho man attitude of main character. The premise behind the female characters problems was interesting to understand.
3,I'll take the middle review option ;),"Ok, since most people either adored or really disliked this book, I'll just say I've found an author to read while Susan Elizabeth Phillips is writing a new novel. I have to say, I also thought the hero had an SEP-touch, but honestly: he doesn't quite develop a heart-touching quality like an SEP-man would, ya know what I mean? I also agree with other readers on not knowing what they see in each other and exactly what foundation their relationship has... On on of the very last pages, the author finally tells us that John loves Georgeanne as a friend, a lover, a woman and Respects her? HELLO?! How the hell did he come to that conclusion? When he tells her he loves her, I can't really blame her for not getting the point, not even the reader who follows his thoughts can do so! Anyway, a really good first book, but some work on WHY people fall in love might be good."
2,"2 stars for potential, but......","it never went anywhere. The whole synopsis of the book occurred in the first 50 pages and then there were 250 more to go and I could care less. There was no chemistry between the h/h the way there was in See Jane Score and True Confessions. And as for their daughter, she was the sterotypical annoying kid who talks baby talk even though she's seven years old. Gibson tried to show that the h/h had their vulnerabilities and were wounded souls, but she never brought that out onto the pages. I'd skip this one."
4,Grammar check please!,"Good story that kept me reading. Needs to be edited for grammatical errors! Overall four stars for a fast, easy read."
4,Yay! The Chinooks!,"This is one of my favorites of the Chinooks series. Rachel has a way of inserting her characters into our hearts, making them unforgettable."
3,Not her best,"It's probably not fair that this was the third hockey romance that I read in a short time period because while it's a very good book, it had trouble with the competition. Georgeanne and John were likable enough characters but the story just does not stand up to Body Check by Deirdre Martin (the best of the three) or Rachel Gibson's latest book, See Jane Score."
3,Much to HOT for me!,"Definately not for those who want a tame romance without much sex. The story was interesting enough, but the spiciness made me uncomfortable."
2,Sometimes You Get What You Pay For...,"I picked this up when it was $0.89, thinking it would be a great fast read for a challenge I am working on over at Goodreads.com. Boy, was I wrong! I couldn't even get 25% into the book! The main female character was a moron! In a contempory romance, I expect that the women have at least some semblance of a back bone, this woman did not. She expected to be taken care of her entire life, simply because she had a learning disorder. How are we as readers supposed to accept that? A much better story might have been watching her struggle to overcome this disorder in some sort of schooling or work setting. Her readiness to give up on learning made it very easy for me to give up on this book."
4,great,so faR THE BOOK IS GREAT HAVENT FINISHED IT YET BUT LOVING EVERY BIT OF IT CANT WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END
5,One of Rachel Gibson's best,I really enjoyed this book. I probably underestimated it going into it since it was the first in the Chinook series but I fell in love with John and would absolutely read this book again!
2,DUMB,"This was such a dissappointing read. Shallow characters i had trouble caring about, gratuitous sex scenes and terrible writing.I prefer a story line that is a little more thought provoking and doesn't insult me with such stereotypical characters. Will the jock ever get together with the big breasted woman!? Who cares!"
1,Simply SUCKS,"Your protagonist is a bimbo (I try to be nice) Georgeanne. SHe's big breasted, and gorgeous but has the brain of a bimbo.Your guy is totally perfect: he likes fleshy women, doesn't believe in dating older/younger partners, and is totally into commitment. Sounds like a puppy, not a man.If taht wasn't enough, Rachel Gibson has a weakness for hackneyed writing. How many times have I heard of female protagonists with ""silky"" hair? The cliches are endless and drive you crazy. I am suprised she has won so many awards; looks like standards are falling.Overall, this is a perfect, happily ending story. It is sickening at times. But hey, some people like that crap."
4,Hooked,Well written light romance. Some heat mixed with a charming story. You will enjoy both lead characters and be invested in hoping for a happy ever after ending. I bought this book for 89 cents and now understand that there are more by this same author. This was the first time I had read Rachel Gibson and definitely won't be the last! Take a chance! Buy the book and look for more from this author!
1,Simply Irresistible,"One word - BORING!!!! I really battled and I have at last given up. At first it moved pretty quickly but once he finds he has the child, it just goes on, and on, and on, and on!!!!! Can't finish this, its really hard to read stuff under your intelligence level sometimes."
5,Couldn't Resist It !!,"After falling head over heels for ""Truly Madly Yours"" I hoped ""Simply Irresistible"" wouldn't let me down. IT DID NOT !! What a great book! Georgeanne Howard has to be one of the freshest characters I've read about in ages. A woman with what many would consider a less than perfect figure, a limited education ( and a learning disability), and the guts and grace to overcome even the highest hurdles life puts in her path! Even big, rough-tough pro hockey player John ""The Wall"" Kowalsky can't resist her sweet Southern charm! Rescuing her from marrying his aging boss was not what John expected and certainly not what Georgeanne bargained for, and after one night together their futures are changed forever. It's a sweet, romantic love story, with characters you can't help but root for. Get this one today! You'll love it, too!!!!!"
5,GOOD BOOK!!,"I rarely give five stars for the books I rate on here, so you know this one is a good one. Okay, maybe I'm biased because I have been searching forever for a romance novel that ties in hockey, my favorite sport. Besides the hockey, this book was also extremely funny, which is a requirement, and a pretty good ""I love you"" scene. All in all, I definitely recommend this book."
3,Love Rachel Gibson...Don't Love Georgie Howard,"I really enjoy Rachel Gibson's books and had read most of the Chinooks series before actually reading this one, the first in the series. Honestly, if this had been the first one I read, I don't know if I would've read more of her books. I usually blow through her books in one day, but this one was harder to get through. I couldn't stand the heroine. She was manipulative, judgmental, and had a victim mentality. And, the rambling...oh my goodness, shut up already! She did get less annoying as the story continued and it did keep me engaged enough to finish it. The relationship between John and Lexie was touching and I am a sucker for the athlete leads in this series. It's worth reading as part of the series, but the rest of the books are much, much better."
3,Great story!,"I would have given it more stars if it weren't for the typos and overall format. At times it was very choppy and other times it jumped around and confused the bejezus out of me. Don't get me wrong, LOVED the story, the formatting just made it very hard to read."
4,I like it,"I reed other books of Rachel GibsonI like romance books with happy end, with humor and its easy and quick too read!"
4,Excellent!,"If you've heard about the Austrian extreme rightist, Joerg Haider, then this is a book that you'd be interested in. It's full of modern political history in Austria. It delves into the fears that many Austrians have whether Haider is the next Hitler by discussing his political strategy.I used this book when I did a thesis for college."
2,defective,"this is a great product, but in the first week after installing it it became defective and water started to leak out of the side of the product."
4,Works very well,"Filter action is great. Shower head performs as advertised, but would benefit from some small range of spray circumference and/or intensity adjustment."
4,Well Done!,"The book came in one piece and in a timely manner. There was some small writing in the book, as some students are wont to for notation purposes, but the pages were whole and legible, with no stains or tears. All in all, a quality used product."
3,"Bought if for ""Talented Mr Ripley"" Song...",I bought this CD to have the original song that was played in the Talented Mr. Ripley movie. The song is great. The rest of the songs are not really my type.
2,Drill bits slip when drilling miniatures,"I used this for pinning miniatures. It works great for about the first little bit, but then starts slipping consistently. I didn't realize that this uses a plastic collet - it wasn't evident from the picture. Found a better one made by the same company (Excel) for $5 at a local hobby shop after I ordered this one, but before it arrived. I suspect that this one was highly overpriced.Also unlike most pin vises, this one does not have a swivel head. I knew that going in, but I figured I would give it a try. Turns out that the swivel head really is necessary."
2,"Very, very old English, and not very entertaining","I bought ""The Wicked Wit of Winston Churchill"" and really enjoyed it, so bought this one in the same series. Wish I hadn't. Not entertaining at all. And almost all the women quoted in there lived in the days not long after the steam engine was introduced."
5,Overlooked Gem,This 1995 release is like a valentine from Eddie. Lots of beautiful love songs. It was just pretty much invisible in the mid-nineties grunge era. Too bad. It is just as good as any of Eddie's other CD's. And now it is out-of-print. If you can find this collectible be sure to add it to your Eddie collection.
2,Let It Burn!!!,"This book is about two middle-aged people with a lot of baggage who are very talented musical artists who want to be together but don't know if they want a relationship. Point blank. It was somewhat interesting, but I'm not a very big fan of Donna Hill anyway so if I were you, I'd save my time and money, unless you like that type of story line. It is very predictable and mildly interesting but not a book that I would read twice.-Pryncez"
1,Not so good!!,I thought the author tried too hard to make the characters seem deep. I thought the book was slow and drawn out. It was a disappointment.
2,ugh.... more like thru the flicker.,"I love Donna Hill. Truly I do. However, this book was not her best.I could not understand how a man just had so much drama going on in hislife and worse yet, the dialogue was so annoying. I actually stoppedcaring whether he got together with the music woman. That is how disinterestedI was in this novel. I don't even remember the names of the main characters.I know people stay loyal to their favorite authors,but there comes a point where you have to admit that a book is not yourfavorite author's best. Maybe because jazz music and poetry are not mymain focus/theme in a novel. I was not enthralled. Better luck next time."
3,"Fine motor skills, not logic","My daughter loved Mighty Mind blocks game where you supposed to guess which blocks to use to fill in the drawing. Here it is all already drawn, all you do is placing blocks in places. Which is good for child's motor skills but does not encourage any creative or logic skills."
4,Magnet Board from Melissa and Doug,"What child doesn't like magnets? This is a great toy for fine motor skill development. The blank magnetic board allows free form work and the design cards allow a child to form a picture. Great for girls, maybe not for boys."
2,"Great idea, but rounded corners=FRUSTRATION","This is such a great idea, but it is impossible to sucessfully fill in several of the patterns because the pattern blocks are rounded and not the same shape as the picture you are supposed to match. It is only a matter of millimeters but in the geometric patterns, that makes a big difference. This has been very frustrating for my 2 and 4 year old children because they see what should fit and it will not fit. We love Melissa and Doug toys but this is one that needs some changes."
5,A fun educational toy,"I purchased this toy for my 3 and 5 year old nephews. I loved the carrying case it came in. They spend alot of time in the car, so that was a big selling feature. The fact that this toy can be used 3 different ways adds to its longevity. For the younger group, you place the picture cards in a slot on top of the magnetic board so that they can match up the tiles with the picture. Both of my nephews had no problem with that. You can also place the card off to the side of the magnetic board and work the ""puzzle"" like that. Finally there is the option of just creating your own design.The picture cards are made of heavy card stock. The only thing I would suggest is taking the cards to get them laminated before play starts.A fun toy that teaches without them knowing, the best kind of educational toy."
5,Grandchildren loved it!,"I purchased this item, sight unseen, online for my granddaughter's birthday. I got great accolades from the parents about how much the 5 year old enjoyed it. I will purchase this line of products again."
5,Wooden magnetic pattern blocks set,"My nine and seven year old granddaughters love this and went right into making their own patterns as soon as they used it. The only downside is the many (easily lost) pieces, but pouch helps carall those.Thank you Melissa and Doug!"
4,nice break from overstimulating toys,My son is almost 4. He got this for Christmas along with LOTS of other gifts. It is a nice winding down toy for him when his younger siblings are napping and mom is working. He enjoys this toy.
4,grandson loves it,Bought for 3 year old grandson. Immediately he started to place the pieces to create shapes. But little brother (1 1/2) started to chew the paper off the top of one shape. Looks like this will be table play so little brother won't interrupt or destroy pieces.
4,The children enjoy playing with the magnetic block set and I'm pleased with it.,The children keep going back to this toy and they seem to like it. I am pleased with the purchase.EDITED a couple of years later to say that the children always go straight for this set when they visit. They never seem to get tired of it.
3,My daughter doesn't play with it,The product is good but I wish it would have circle shapes also.It's nice but for some reason my daughter doesn't play with it. She likes other puzzles and pattern sorters a lot but this one is not a hit for some reason. Maybe it's not age appropriate. My daughter just turned 3.
3,not as durable as I expected.,Megnets are very light it is easy to move they don't stay on strongly. the paper whole set is not made as strong and durable as I thought they should for a three years old......not the best ideas for cars since megnetic pieces do not stay on well and it will fall in your car. They should have use more megnetic power in it.
2,If you want a mess!,"I thought this would be so cool to help kids think and do patterns, but all I got was a huge mess. Pieces everywhere, The cards were also all over. It did not work with the kids like I thought it would. We ended up getting rid of it."
3,Just OK.,"I originally bought this to keep my kids busy on a plane trip, but it was so big it didn't fit in my backpack carry-on. The kids have played with it a few times at home and it generally keeps them busy for about 10-15 minutes. The blocks don't line up exactly and they had a hard time following the more difficult patterns. Not the best investment I've ever made, but it's ok..."
2,"Amazing, toe-tapping music!","If you want some great dixieland style jazz, then I suggest Turk Murphy. You won't be disappointed. It always puts a smile on my face and gets my toe a tappin'!"
4,Kindle,"Hello, does anyone know if this book on the Kindle have page numbers?My class needs my referencing of ideas and thoughts by author and page numbers.Thank youSteve"
4,Good read for relaxation and fun!,Very entertaining and engaging. Was a quick read and held my interest. This author does a great job.
2,"Nice book but it left me wanting more, too skimpy.","First of all the format is way, way too small, what was there was nice but I wanted to see more of everything, more recipes, more historical photos, more contemporary photos of the interiors, some advertising and graphic design would have been nice, I came away unsatisfied. Perhaps the author didn't have access to alot of the archival materials since it was going to be sold off to FDS. BOO!"
2,"Great performances, terrible album reissue","I can't think that a historic recording label like Pablo made a so great mistake. In the booklet inner are liner notes from an other album! Yes, liner note is from a Cannonball Adderley album...It's an unforgivable oversight.However there are great performances from two European concerts"
5,Nice book,"This is an older title, but we have enjoyed reading it and sharing it with our granddaughter. If you like chipmunks, this is a fun little book."
2,Teeny Tiny Tale,"The text of this book is very nice, describing the adventures in the day of a chipmunk , but I must warn you this book and the others in the series are tiny. I don't feel the above description emphasizes that. I suppose the pictures are nice, but they are hard to really see, and the text print is small. This is not a book I feel I can read aloud, it's too small to show the pictures and read at the same time even snuggling, and children who can read themselves might possibly be to old for it. All that said, I did enjoy the story and would recommend it for that, of course the size issue is my own opinion. I would love this series if it was in a different format."
3,Dated Movies,"Was looking for an animated version, got this collection of short movies.They were donated to the Religious Education group at the Church. They are good for 10-14 year olds."
5,An Excellent Tool For All...,This book really came in handy when helping my girlfriends and I really get the flow of our bible study going. I highly recommend it to all!!!
3,Dashed Anticipation,"I bought this book in great anticipation and was dissapointed to find that only the first 72 pages, equal to one quarter of the book were devoted to South African food. I felt duped! and my further disappointement were blatant misrepresentations e.g. Traditional Bobotie is made with ground cooked lamb not beef. As a one South African to another, Ms. Rosen please be true to our cuisine."
5,Excellent,"Tried traditional and true. I use so many of these recipes all the time. All the classic favorites like Bobotie, Lamb Curry etc. Hard to go wrong with this purchase."
3,It's works but is a PAIN to put together and take apart,This one of those products that you hate to use because it's such a pain to put together. For me I'd pass and find something that more practicle. This is not what I call a good product
3,the language of this map?,"I've thought that it's published in English but when I had it, I found it was in some other language that I don't know..."
5,Absolutely a very moving album,"The extended version of ""Unchained Melody"" is very moving and provocative to say the least.... certain and emotionally charged peice.... incidentally the rest of the cd isn't half bad either...."
3,Mixed Bag,"While the 'pro' is that it remakes the original mono with a more modern stereo product, it sounds to me like it is a rushed, low budget effort backed by studio musicians without much rehearsal. At the time Bobby and Bill recorded it, their original melody blend is a bit lost in this re-make after so many years. If you want to hear their original blend you might actually like a re-issue version of their original recordings, which appear not to be from an original master."
3,"Great quality, but not the original recordings","I should have known that the album that contained all of the songs I wanted on one album was too good to be true. All of these recordings, although of excellent sound quality, are newer arrangements of the originals. The biggest disappointment is ""Rock and Roll Heaven,"" their best ever song, in my opinion. All the lyrics are changed to reflect some of the more current passings of some music legends. If you want originals, this ins't the album for you."
1,Did not get the item I ordered.,Did not recieve the correct CD. I returned the wrong CD on July 2nd and have not had any responce from anybody about the CD. I would like to have the CD.Thank you
1,Nowhere NEAR the original,"This CD doesn't do Righteous Brothers' fans justice. Example: ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"" is so nasal in this version compared to ""Unchained Melody"""
4,Insightful,"I really liked the parts where scripture was included in this DVD, this is a must have for people who like history, or may be curious aboutOther thoughts and understandings!!!!"
3,Good informatio- way too long and repetitive,"Good information and tool for those that are awakening. Good quality video and scene selection options. However, it is a bitt too long and rather repetitive half way through. Do not watch it before going to bed as you will fall asleep towards the end. Otherwise, its very informative, scripturally based and the TRUTH. Just needs a little tweeking with editing. Shalom"
5,Hebrew or the So-called Negro,"On a scale of 1-10, I would rate Hebrew or the So-Called Negro 100! Yah Ya out did himself on this one. The quaility of this documentary is at such a high standard, that his other documentaries will have a hard time measuring up to this one."
3,The content is overshadowed by the low quality video,"The quality of the DVD looks like someone made a ""home copy."" I was turned off by the lack of quality of the recording. It's an embarrassment."
3,Not what was expected,"I expected a product that would provide historical facts based on tangible evidence with clean production. However, much of what was given within this body of work was testimony on what persons claimed they knew or just statements without tangible confirmation. Also, the production of the video was annoying (background, white noise, etc).I appreciate the effort, however, to be taken seriously, more research and production needs to put forth prior to the next release. I will still support the endeavor. Also, this DVD is more of a threshold of information rather than an actual source. It will leave you wanting to research for yourself. In this aspect the DVD serves ""a"" purpose rather than the purpose of enlightenment.Man, Know Thy Self."
1,Total A-Historical Propagana,"The ""hoax"" is this video. It is complete rubbish. It is based on pure fantasy and pseudo history. Absolutely appalling."
2,Kyjen TireBiter Retriever,"I bought two of these for my German Short Haired Pointer. GSP's are great retrievers, but tend to chew things for amusement. My GSP chewed the heck out of this product, and has pretty much destroyed it in a matter of a few weeks. The product also has a strong rubber smell when you first get it, and my dog was ill for a few days after initially playing with it. I can only assume that some of the chemicals from the manufacturing process had not dissipated. I would recommend washing and letting the product sit out for a while. I would not recommend this product for breeds smaller than 30 lbs. as it is quite heavy. I would not recommend this product for breeds that have a strong chewing tendancy."
5,You all missed the point,"Obviously Joe Pass was a technical virtuoso who possesed a profoundmastery of the guitar. One only needs listen to Virtuoso and with any appreciation for jazz guitar, understand that Joe Pass was one of the greats. Fast, focused, and intense - but what was he saying? Did he prove himself as one of the fastest guitar player ever, perhaps? Can he swing with the best of them, absolutely! But other than that, what was he saying?But - when you listen to an album like this or Unforgettable, he SAYS something! Anyone can play fast - but can they say something! Thats the question. You get an appreciation for the man when you listen to this album - not his uncanny ability to swing or his lightning fast licks.He was reaching for something deeper!Just my humble opinion."
1,User Unfriendly,"Poor program. It is not compatable with any other quicken software, and does not allow for any bank/ccard downloads. You need to enter each item individually, making it very time consuming. This is no better than a simple excel spreadsheet."
1,"Like a spreadsheet, but less useful","This Rental Property Manager is like having one register for each property to track credits and debits. Some reports. Thats it. Using the regular Quicken Basic, with a Banking account and a Property/Asset account, works better and gives you a way to compare operating expenses, income, mortgage/loan information, and property value. Since its scope is limited, having shorter lists of categories and tax schedules and lines to worry about than in the regular Quicken software, but the limited scope and higher cost for a focused subset of Quicken Basic? Not so useful."
1,No Support,They stopped supporting this product about a year ago. There is nobody on the forums. Dont Buy!
3,Few things to consider...,"Manual mentions that the pump should not be run dry and should also be full of water when started; both to prevent burnout. Kind of strange for a self-priming pump. The manual does not mention that it is self-priming. It also says to hand-turn the pump a few times if it hasn't been used for a while.These restrictions make the pump questionable for my intended use - a backup for a sump pump in my basement. Would have been nice to know this before I bought it!Also, this pump looks identical to a pump at Harbor Freight at twice the price. The HF pump is also the same pipe size and horsepower but lists half the gph. Hopefully, this pump has a bigger impeller to reflect the larger pump rate?"
2,poorly made,"i know that you get what you pay for. but i don't think of this as cheap. i did finally get the pump running. it leaked in two places, the fan shroud fell off, the cooling impellers were bent so far it wouldn't run, there where rust chips falling out of the impellers, two motor screws were cross threaded, and the bearings squeal. other than that this is a pump. spend a little more and save a whole lot of time. i have no doubt that i will be buying another pump soon."
4,northern industrial h20 pump 1/2 hp,This item is very affordable and arrived immediately. I am very impressed with how quickly it made it to us. So far it is functioning well. My only complaint is that the metal is quite weak and the electrical cover is brittle as well. The metal broke near one of the mounting holes for the bolt as well as the electrical cover. This unit also came with a plug and did not need to be wired. As far as the pump goes it works great and is very quiet.I am very impressed with how quickly and smoothly ordering this item went. Thanks.
3,different pump sent,"got 650gph oteche pump instead, supposed to be same, EH!, had to fill the pump part then pull fan cover and rotate the thing til it started to turn by itself, ran it for awhile before it would start by itself, not sure it will hold up still making noise, it may hold up but not sure"
5,Good Speaker,Great speaker!! very good highs and mids some people have complained about the bass response I think it could maybe possibly have a little more but I think that would make the voices sound slighlty unnacurate i think this speaker when playing voices the dialogue sounds so realistic and can go to very high volumes with very very little distortion it is a great speaker and i would reccomend to anyone.
1,"Initially pleased, then horribly disappointed","I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. It worked for a little while, but after a few uses it wouldn't even power up. I have been trying all week to get satisfaction from the company at nextar.com and I have had no support whatsoever. I have emailed them and called them three times with no answer. I will not be doing business with this company any more. If you buy one, definately buy the extended warrantee because you will probably be using it."
1,not sure yet,"i bought one of these for my mothers b-day and it did not work... it would not power on at all... i had to send it back and i have not received the new one yet... i dont know if i made a mistake by getting the same one or if i should have gotten my money back or replaced it with another item.. anyway, my mother liked the looks of this one (because its pink, im sure) so thats the one i got her... maybe mine was just a defect... i will post a new coment on how the new one works when i get it..I got the new one and it has been working great ever since! my mom loves it and listens to it everyday.. very easy to use and sounds great! I guess the first one i bought was just a dud but amazon was very helpfull and had a new one to me in a matter of days.. very happy!"
4,Great Item,"It is a bit scary to use, but works extremely well. Shipper got it out quite quickly, too."
2,...Eh,"I work in a professional environment which requires me to wear heels all day. When I'm not wearing heels, I slip on my sandals... all which contribute to my dry, rough feet. I have hated that my feet look so bleh, so I bought this based on the reviews to hopefully improve my conditions. I think this was mentioned in one, if not more, review, but I definitely feel the need to say it again: it came with NO instructions (except how to replace the blade). It doesn't say if you should use it wet or dry, how much pressure to apply, etc. I blindly started attempting to use it and nothing was really happening, so naturally I pressed harder. I started getting some stuff off, not what I was expecting... eventually it went too deep and I ended up with a bloody foot, which I could not get to stop. I was devastated. My feet looked worse than before I used it. I would not recommend this product."
3,a bit disappointing,"I purchased this callus shaver with vision of all the money I'd save by not getting pedicures at the salon, but I must say I am disappointed. I don't know if I have tougher or thicker calluses than other people, but I have not had the best of results with this product. At the salon, I see strings of dead skin come off of their callus tools, but this product barely creates any, and then, only with more pressure from me than I feel really comfortable about. Another thing: do not leave this item in the shower! The blades are extremely prone to rusting- one or two days left there will render the blade totally unusable!On a positive note, the rasp is useful and the design is pretty good. I purchased a bunch of replacement blades from my local Beauty Brands (though they are also available here on Amazon) and I am hoping that will make a difference in how this product performs."
2,Not impressed,Product worked fine but our only problem with it was that the only thing holding the razor in place is a small white plastic piece. This plastic piece does not like to stay in place and sometimes falls out which causes the razor to fall out! We stopped using this when the razor blade fell off and got lost somewhere in our couch! I would not recommend this item.
5,Amazing product,"I was hesitant to get this b/c I was afraid it would hurt. But it's super easy to use, doesn't hurt at all, and very effective. It does take a couple tries to figure it out, though - long, light sweeps work better than going slow and deep. It's also a really great price. Highly recommend!"
3,A little too strong,"This product works great, but I think it's only good for extremely callused feet. My feet got all raw after using this because it's just a blade cutting of your skin. I prefer the Ped Egg, but this probably works wonders for very bad calluses."
4,"Callus shaver works great, rasp not so great.","The reason I bought this product was for the callus shaver. It works great. I use it as soon as I get out of the shower, one or two times a week. Be sure to dry the excess water off first, or it will just slide right across, accomplishing nothing. I've tried using the rasp quite a few times, but I feel like it doesn't do anything. I guess the holes are too small to make as big of an impact as I was hoping for. Overall, great product!"
3,Effective but stronger than other callus shavers,"I decided to try this shaver after trying the generic shaver of a generic drugstore brand. The drugstore brand worked well initially but the razors dulled quickly and the replacement were almost impossible to insert.By contrast this shaver is super effective but I've seriously cut my feet twice using it exactly the same way I used my former razor. In the future, I'll go for the less effective razor over the ""no callus but bloody foot approach."""
2,Hmm..,This crap fell apart with my first use. The spring that holds the little button in place popped out and so did the button. The blade also fell off while I was using it. The Callus Shaver itself is alright. Nothing to write home about unless you are warning someone not to waste $10 on this thing. I should have just gone with a cheaper model. I'm sure the same results could be achieved and I wouldn't feel such a way about it.
3,"Very sharp, be careful","This tool does a good job of removing thick callus, but I did manage to cut myself (my fault--it's a razor!). I was upset at cutting myself, and although I am not diabetic, I do worry about foot wounds. I doubt I'll use the razor part again, but the rasp is good. Just FYI, I have used and like the Ped Egg. It's difficult to cut yourself with it, and it does shave off dead skin.The Tweezerman Callus Shaver comes with no instructions except how to change the blade which is printed in a very tiny font on the back."
4,It works on hands too.,I do weightlifting. This shaver is great for removing calluses on my hands.I give it four stars because some spots on the hands are hard to reach if not near impossible.
2,Not very effective,"The blade is dull and tough to actually use. I know they're trying to be safe but they definitely compromised functionality. Also, the ""file"" was not effective at all. I might ask well have been trying to tickle my foot."
1,HORRIBLE,"This had such amazing reviews and I wanted to believe it would work on my rough feet, but it didn't work at all. It actually fell apart and cut my foot really badly when I was using it. I don't understand how everyone else got it to work so great, but it didn't work for me at all and I threw it in the trash. I wished there had been real directions and even though I found a simple how-to video online it still didn't work for me."
3,"loved it, but it rusted!","I used my razor in the shower so that my feet were wet--it worked fantastic! My feet were much more smooth. But the handy slider that protects you from the blade? That also traps water in there. I thought that the razor would be able to air dry (after all, the directions said NOTHING about taking the razor apart in order to let it air dry) but low and behold...it's completely rusted. I thought about trying to clean the rust off so that I was still able to use it, but really...who wants to risk shaving themselves with a rusty razor?So I had to toss it...after only one use. The entire thing had rust on it--not just the razor. I might buy another. But I'm really disappointed that it rusted. My regular razor doesn't rust. I don't want to have to take it completely apart every time I use it and have a razor blade lying around."
1,Fell apart after one use -_-,"I don't know if it's just the way I used it or what but this thing fell apart after I used it once, on one foot! I'll stick to the professionals at my nail salon lol."
1,arrived broken,"All of these devices are pretty much that same: same mechanism, build, etc. The key is the blade, and this one comes with a very good Sollingen steel one. Problem is that it arrived broken: the clear, plastic slide casing that allows movement between the rasp and the blade in two halves that could not be rejoined. Give me real German manufacturing anyday! Disappointing, but not worth returning."
3,Not for hands,"I crossfit and that builds a lot of callus on the the palms just below the fingers. To prevent tearing the skin, I need to remove this as often as possible. A callus shaver is perfect to do this.This model doesn't work well on hands, because, the holder for the blade is flat. It does not allow you to get into the palm well. To use this tool, you need to bend the holder backwards. That works great, but now you cannot use the other end of as the plastic guard will not open to cover the shaver.I use a single callus shaver that is already bent and it works really well.Gave this one to my wife and it works great for her feet and she loves it."
3,Needs Instructions,"I read reviews to get an idea of how to use this, having never used one (though needed it!) before.Price was cheap enough I wanted to see how it worked. Instructions only tell you how to change the blade. Not sure if I'm doing it right and not sure how far to go, but it works. I just wish I knew how to use it correctly."
2,dont mean to be callus,I couldn't figure out how to use even with instructionsit seemed to be more complicated than I thought it would be
1,Not good.,This callus remover does not work well. There is not enough razor material to do the job. I do not recommend this tool.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"This has to be one of the worst products I have purchased on Amazon. To be honest I'm surprise they are carrying it.. I should have gone with the reviews. The purchase arrived today.. Just like one of the reviewers I cut myself trying to get the blade in. It's cheap!! No instructions etc. I would not recommend... Yes, it's going back!"
2,Easiest way I've found to make my feet bleed in a painless fashion.,"I've used standards single edge razor blades for years to keep my corns at bay, once you get used to the method it works well and gives you the control you need to shave off what you need to and not cut yourself.That's where this item has the issue. It has one shaving depth and if you're just trying to get a little off the top it isn't a good device. This is fine for giant thick corns that haven't been kept up with in awhile but if you're going after a regular maintenance routine the one depth fits all won't work too well.The device appears to be well constructed, the sliding safety shield is actually pretty cool and I like the rasp but I'm going back to the simple single edged razor for control purposes. Cheaper, easier and does exactly what I need. I'll hang onto this for the rasp side but I won't be using the corn razor again."
3,"Not quite up to the ""Mistral experience...""","I love love love this company. However, as someone who uses soap and lotion in place of perfume/cologne, etc., when it comes to lotions, I'm about the scent as much as the lotion's hydrating qualities. The lavender lotion doesn't have as rich a lavender scent as EO Everyday Body Lotion/French Lavender. The EO lotion sells for about 1/3 the cost of the Mistral lotion (if you buy it here, via Amazon's Subscribe & Save program, but it's cheaper anywhere, really). The hydrating qualities are about the same, although the Mistral lotion does have a ""richer"" feel, going on. I'm just sharing this to help anyone else who really cares about the ""scents"" of lotions. I'm insane for the scent of Mistral's Wild Blackberry lotion, which, for some mysterious reason, has been discontinued, and also enjoy Mistral's South Seas scent."
5,smells old,i bought this lotion because i'm IN LOVE with the perfume. the lotion does not hold a candle to it tho. it smells old. but then again they discontinued the lotion a long time ago. delivered on time. great shipping condition unused as said. shipper is great! just mistral lotion in wild black berry does not hold up very good over time. id like to rate the lotion as a high 2 or 3 but its not about the product its about the shipper and they get a 5. thank you
3,Mistral Body Lotion doesn't feel like its moisturizing well enough for me,"The Grapefruit/Red Currant scent is wonderful and because it smells so good I will use it up and maybe order again. But, as a nearly 50 year old, it doesn't leave my skin feeling moisturized the way that I like. I might check out some of Mistral's other products. I love having so many scents to choose from."
2,Not my cup of tea...,"I stopped in the middle of Chapter 5.The paced felt unbalanced, and a bit slow.So many characters coming and going and it was difficult keeping track of who was who; and, it was difficult where the character was going, literally and metaphorically, in terms of clues he was following.We are told that the police are told to be trailing the main character who was said to be framed for murder,the character who is named George Wilson, but also goes by Johnny McBride.Judging from some of the other comments, there were those that enjoyed the book. For me, however, it didn't turn out to be my cup of tea."
3,You'll learn the basics,"A useful video for first time jugglers--my own skills have noticeably improved through viewing--I share others' skepticism about its applicability for more advanced juggling. I also wonder whether most people can stomach too many repeat viewings of Wengler's somewhat annoying personality. To be sure, he teaches with patience and thoroughness--at least for the first half hour. But I found Wengler sufficiently grating to force me to limit my contact with the soundtrack after a while. Still, as in all matters instructional, it's the message one should pay attention to, not necessarily the messenger--and his tape *was* of great assistance. Given the low price--and absence of much other video competition--there's every reason to start your juggling here."
2,A fad from yesteryear,"I thought I'd try the Lean Bodies diet and 'philosophy' as a change to my normal routine. I can't really say if it's sound or not, but it wasn't for me. It feels like a fad from a bygone time. The more we learn about fitness and the maintenance of the body, older fads really become dated. The recipes were bland and there's just no way that I could enjoy life the 'lean bodies' way. It's all about lots of exercise and increasing your caloric intake. I get plenty of exercise and go to the gym 3-5 times a week. I love working out but I don't like feeling restricted. It's important to find what works for you and that is different for everyone. I'm sure this system has helped people, but I'm not one of them."
2,Not a value,I found this product(actually the 12 quart version) at Walgreen's for $1 a piece. Not worth it at all. Look elsewhere
3,Not what I thought it was,"Be warned - this is NOT the product you can sometimes find in your supermarkets. This is a mini-canister with 3 2-quart packs that makes 6 quarts, NOT the full size canister with 6 2-quart packs that makes 12 quarts. I misread it and found out the hard way."
1,My advice - Do not buy this item,"I am very disappointed with this product.1. Though it said ""In stock"" it turned out that it is not, and I had towait a month before I got it.2. Even though the HY3010E is supposed to be for up to 10A, I am unableto get more than 1.5A out of it, no matter what voltage I am settingit to, and no, it is not an operation mistake that I am making.Bottom line - I guess there is a reason why this model is so cheap comparing to other similar product. My advice - buy something else."
5,Clear and Concise,"I've gotta echo all the other rave reviews for this fine book. It's wonderfully clear and concise, with the best explanations of statistical concepts I've seen. Its only fault (as a textbook) is a lack of exercises & answers. But you can remedy this lack by going to a used bookstore and picking up a cheap old copy of any good elementary stats textbook (I recommend either Freedman & Purvis or John Freund for this purpose). Kudos, Kash, for a splendidly lucid (and inexpensive) introduction to a tough subject. You've saved me and hundreds of other students from confusion, frustration, and poor grades. Write on!"
3,"OK for conceptual understanding, but lacking detail","This book is written in a style that is fairly easy to understand, so it's not a bad book for beginners. However, it lacks some of the details that you would need to know if you actually want to perform the analyses that it describes conceptually. Also, many of the topics covered in this book (correlation analysis, regression, and ANOVAs) are not truly multivariate techniques. For example, this book covers one-, two-, and three-way ANOVAs, but does not talk about MANOVA or Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM), which are more appropriate for large datasets that are truly multivariate. In my opinion, this is an OK book to introduce you to the basic statistics (both univariate and multivariate). However, once you actually decide to perform any of these techniques as part of real research, I'd suggest buying a more in depth book (perhaps Multivariate Data Analysis by Joseph Hair)."
3,Not enough,"I am very disappointed that the title of this book is very misleading. Although the book is very clear in presenting theory and materials, there is lack of much materials if anyone who wants to have a guide on the multivariate statistics."
4,Best bang for the buck,"It's an extra-life battery so it's wider(thicker) than the original. That makes the phone a bit bulkier than with the original one. It would have been nice if this had been made clear in the description of the battery! However, for the price it's an absolute bargain; and since the phone itself is so out-of-date, what difference does the extra bulk really mean - not much! If you're still using this phone, you must not be too particular(and I am not) so this battery will work just fine."
2,"OK, but there are better options","The plot was predictable but still workable. I skipped over bits that seemed like waffle and not essential to the storyline, eg., towards the end of the book a minor character visits his parents and we learn a bit about his childhood and therefore his personality - but given that it was a short book with five main characters already, I was aksing myself, ""why is this here?"". I would have rather had learnt more about the main characters. Also, it was almost as if the author was trying to write well, instead of writing characters that we cared about and wanted to follow. The positive feedback is that I actually finished the book, instead of giving up, so it was obviously better than the book I attemped just before Heartswap, but I'm glad it was a borrowed book and I didn't waste money buying it. If you like this genre, try Marian Keyes or Fiona Walker before this one."
1,"Same Book, New Title","As stated by another reviwer, this is basically the same book as the earlier ""You Can Heal your Life Workbook."" My personal preference with this type of book, in which you are writing and doing exercises, is to have a basic, soft-cover, easy-to-use format. This version is printed as a fancy gift-y type of book, with shiny full-color pages and a lot of (to me) distracting and unnecessary illustrations. So...if you like pretty, gift-y books, get this version. If not, get a copy of the earlier version. But YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY BOTH!"
4,You Can Heal Your Life Compainion Book,"Did not officially start with the work, but the cover caught my eye and I know and respect Louise L. Hay's work. It's alternative healing, another great book to look at is ""Waking the Tiger"". In order to understand oneself, a person needs to revisit the past, and the ""...Compainion Book"" allows and guides you to do so, without fear or judgement. It teaches you how not to beat yourself up verbally. At times we can be our own worst critics. It's a great healing journey tool."
2,looks cool but doesn't work that well,"I was looking for something simple for my car and ordered this. The only problem is that it didn't give off much scent at all and the ""insides"" were gone within a few weeks."
4,A mistake in identity,The below reader must be thinking about a completely different John Gill. The John Gill with which this book is about completely revolutionized bouldering as we knew it and has pushed the limits of bouldering in radical new directions.
1,Don't waste your time on this one,"I don't know who the authors or publishers thought this book would appeal to, possibly some Dilbert-world middle-manager who'd like to fling buzzwords around, but certainly not anyone trying to do real work. The table of contents is very impressive, too bad there isn't any content to back it up."
1,You'll need more than just the book.,"I learned a few nice buzzwords, and found out what all the other things are I'll need to learn to build web databases, but this book starts out by telling you ""we've left out the programming...that's for experts"". That was my first clue that I wasn't going to learn many new things in this one. A beginner won't get many of the good basics here, and programmers won't learn anything new. The topics are all over the place. There doesn't appear to be a clear target audience for this book!"
1,All the stuff that was edited out of other books,"This book was amazingly poor. The majority of the book is just the authors describing all of the different tools that are available. In order to actually DO anything, you need to run the shareware programs on the CD. This book might as well have been 100 pages long and called ""Cold Fusion and Access for people with too much money in their pockets""."
1,This book [isn't very good],"I don't know what this guy was smoking when he wrote it, or what the publisher was snorting when he signed this guy, but for christ's sake let's sterilize both of them to prevent this type of [garbage] from clogging our inputs."
3,Good introduction,This is a book that will give you a very basic introduction to small scale database driven websites. Came with a time limited version of personal Oracle7.
5,French trad with just enough snarl!!,"Central France trad features a lot of hurdy-gurdy and bagpipe, and some of the music, for want of a better term, is just plain snarly and biting -- like the wolf (le loup). Plus there are so many great French trad tunes named after the wolf -- Ai Vist Le Loup, Pas de Loup, on and on, from Bourbonnais and Auvergne. What a great idea to do a CD project of this music? And like the other reviewer said, you couldn't have asked for a better group of musicians. Anne-Lise Foy is one of the best hurdy-gurdy players around, ditto for Basile Bremaud on fiddle, and Lazarevich and the great Dominic Paris are no slouches on pipes. Great stuff. Thank goodness you can get it in the US through Amazon."
1,Poor quality,"This is a poor quality product, I felt that it was not absorbed at all. Try the Managanese from GNC or others."
4,Read it and loved it,"Linda Buzzell gives an excellent account of how to make it in Hollywood. Any person reading this book can learn a lot if they choose to follow their dreams into moviemaking and acting. This book definitely was helpful in getting my last movie, The S.I.N., distributed. And, it will be helpful as I put together my new radio show, The Indie Film Hour, on World Talk Radio. Thanks Linda. www.vdefilms.com"
4,More than just Hollywood,"This book was required reading for an exploratory class I was taking on Entertainment Technology Careers. It proved to teach me a lot more than just that, it gives you insightful and helpful tips as well as the exercises within the chapters that assist you in finding out what it is that you really want to do and where your motivation comes from. I think it is an invaluable book for not only people seeking work in the entrainment field but for people who aren't really sure which way to go about it or which end they'd like to be in."
4,I recommend it,"I bought this book for my cousin who wants to start out in the movie business. I bought this book for him so he can get a good idea who's who in the industry. The resources are a little out dated, but the valuable info is timeless."
4,Still relevant today,There are some really good nuggets of info in this book. I've been in the industry for many years and I still found it useful. Worth the read.
5,Great movie for the family,Loved this movie when I was little and still love it fir my own children. It is gender and adult friendly! A must have
4,Cool 2-pack of Disney movies,Bought this as a present and thought it was interesting that they include the second movie in there as well. I honestly did not even know that there was a sequel to the first one until I found this online.
3,1 and 2 together,"I really do enjoy these movies so I bought it however the 2nd isn't nearly as good as the 1st. I love how they put 1 and 2 in one pack. The only flaw that I hate about Disney movies is that god damn Disney vault that makes me feel like I have to buy or I won't be able to get it again for 10 years. Also with Disney starting to make all their movies in 3D I wanted to wait but if it says going into the vault then I don't want to have to wait 10 years to buy it again let alone if they actually do come out with a 3D edition.New: found out on the 2nd dvd disk it skips/pauses at 1 part (not a huge deal) but seriously, I paid for a new movie, it should NOT be skipping the first time I use it. The 1st dvd seems to be fine however it is not Disney best ""remaster"""
1,Not it....,"This movie was a set. I only got the second movie, really wanted the first one. After getting everything set I find it's too late to return it. Now I'm out the movie I wanted and stuck with one I didn't."
4,double feature,I love that both movies were packages together. This made a great gift for my daughter who loves Disney films.
5,Fox and Hound 1 and 2,This classic was a gift for our granddaugher. It's a very cute story that a three year old can watch over and over again. The movie arrived in great condition and I was satisfied with the speed of the delivery. The price was very acceptable. I would order from this person again.
3,"The Fox and the Hound was good, but II was terrible","I enjoyed the Fox and the Hound, but II was just a big no no. There was no point to II. I didn't like how it had so many musical numbers in it. The Fox and the Hound isn't a musical!! I've tried watching this movie twice all the way through but I can't. I can only make it to the first half hour and that's it. It gets beyond boring. Stick with the original film and forget the second ever happened. You will like II if you are under the age of 10. The HD transfers were really nice and complemented this 30 year old film."
1,Blu-ray - as cheap as Disney could make it....,1. Cheap packaging - (DVD's are stacked)2. The movies themselves have not been restored (like every release was prior to this..)3. Two movies on one blu-ray disk (not convenient if you want to separate)4. No real extras on the Blu-ray (and what extras they did include they put them on the DVD's)I own each and every Disney Blu-ray movie and this by far is the absolute worst job I have ever seen Disney do.Who ever is responsible for this release should truly be ashamed!
4,There was some magic left out.,"My wife has been collecting the Blu-ray releases of Disney classics as they have released and this release has been no different. But something is missing in this translation, it seems that Disney didn't put their A team on this product, while you can tell it was remastered and can certainly tell the difference in picture quality, its not a solid state of quality. At times it looks AMAZING at others it just looks upgraded. while I don't know why this is, maybe something happen to the master source during remastering and is the cause but, we have Pinocchio on Blu-ray which is a far older movie and it's just Jaw-dropping on Blu-ray. If you're a fan of ""The Fox and the Hound"" this is a definite pick-up but if you happen to be a nitpicky about how your movies look and are expecting just the absolute best, especially from Disney you might want to hold off to see if they actually remaster the remaster."
5,Happy Customer .,I received the movie in a timely manner. The product is of great quality and price. I'm very happy with it!
5,A wonderful book about a tragic part of Texas history!,"Being a Texas girl, who lived not far from Galveston, this book was especially an excellent book to me. The Hurricane was a tragic event that hit Galveston before all the high-tech modern warning systems. They were literally swept away before they really knew what hit them. Mrs. Thompson has taken a piece of history and put a very human face and human emotions behind this horrible tragedy. I loved the fact that a few of the characters were really ""actual people from that time period, and others were based loosely on real people who experienced this event. My heart especially broke about the orphanage victims and the valiant nuns who tried everything in their power to help these children survive. The next time we go to Galveston, I would like to stop at the museum and view the section of pictures and stories from this terrible hurricane. Don't hesitate on this book---it is EXCELLENT!"
4,A n enjoyable book,"The timing of Janice Thompson's book, Hurricane, couldn't have been better. I read Hurricane after our third hurricane in Florida this summer. It was interesting to read the author's vivid words and compare them to the pictures being flashed on television. Janice really did a great job of describing what the hurricane of 1900 must have been like. This is a work of fiction based on facts and Janice did a superb job of research and creating characters to put into that world. It's a fast, interesting read with God woven into the fabric of the story."
4,"Wonderful, Inspiring Read!","Set against the bacdrop of the 1900 hurricane that nearly swept Galveston Island off the map, Ms. Thompson gives us a marvelous example of how people find courage in the face of fear, strength in the face of adversity and faith where there was doubt...all through the miraculous sovergnity of God; His love and His grace."
2,Big Disappointment,"I have read many of Miss Thompson's books and liked most of them. I read this book in the Kindle version, and I don't know what happened to it. The mistakes were so many that I kept asking myself why I kept on reading. Typos, misplaced sentence parts, and flat out wrong words just jump out at me. The story did hold me for a while. But then I had more than a third to go and just got tired of the distruction and human suffering. I don't know the history of this great hurricane, but many of the scenes were unbelievable even in the name of fiction. Sorry, Janice, I had to quit the book before I finished it. I just couldn't stomach anymore."
2,Neither good history nor engaging romance.,"Adults characters should not, if they are to be credible and at all sympathetic, snicker, sneer, pout, and wring their hands. They should not visit with a friend while in the midst of a hurricane. They can't in fact hear each other in the midst of a hurricane, because it is like a freight train going through town. Nor should they step out onto a hurricane-ravaged street in a town where over 6000 have died and smile because the sky is blue. Anyone that shallow and insensitive can't be a romantic hero. Read Isaac's Storm to really read about this tragic event. If you read this book instead, you are cheating yourself and not doing credit to the catastrophe. The romance doesn't work mainly because the hero is totally unsympathetic and the setting is forced."
3,"Handy, but not the best manual for detailed information","I suppose its difficult to compile information on lesser grown veggies, and this book does a good job of putting them all in one place. But often times the specific info you typically look for in a gardening book like when to plant, how to feed etc. are lacking in many entries. It just give general crop info, uses etc. But, if you are a serious gardener and interested in growing some more unusual things, you should definitely add this to your collection."
1,Not for a 60 Pound Dog,"My dog weighs 60 pounds. When holding him back from ""greeting"" another dog the large ring at the end of the collar (to which the leash was attached) separated, pulled apart, and released the dog. You simply cannot have this happen."
5,WONDERFUL!!,"MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH ENJOYED THIS BOOK. WE WERE LAUGHING FROM THE VERY FIRST STORY. WE COULD BOTH FIND PEOPLE THAT WE 'KNEW' IN THE STORIES (AND SOME WERE OUR OWN ADVENTURES). WE HAVE SHARED THIS BOOK WITH SEVERAL OF OUR FRIENDS AND THEY WERE AS PLEASED AS WE WERE. IF YOU ENJOY COWBOYS, YOUNG BOYS THAT WILL BE COWBOYS, AND GOOD CLEAN HUMOUR IN GENERAL - YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK."
3,more informative 'legend' is required,i feel that there should be a more developed 'legend'. all the family names are there but there is no grid markings (like you would find on a street map) to help you locate the family name. it would be a helpful tool and make the map more user friendly.thank you
4,"Would you like to watch the session,as well?","While the CD is, as you would expect, very good, it is also interesting to watch the session, which is included on the DVDNorman Granz Presents Duke: The Last Jam Session."
4,Duke's Big 4,"Musically, this CD is incredible. I just wish I was warned in advance that this product was Japanese - and that consequently all the album notes within were in that language."
4,"I own Benoit/ freeman Project one and project two cd's and I believe that two is the best, it cleansed my soul","I own Benoit/ freeman Project one and project two cd's and I believe that two is the best, it cleansed my soul"
2,"Sorry, but I hated it","I'm a big fan of Russ Freeman and The Rippingtons, and I also own the first Benoit-Freeman Project cd. Although I must admit that I used to enjoy it, I quickly grew tired of Benoit's playing.The Benoit Freeman Project had a concert scheduled in my area so I ordered the cd hoping to receive it in advance of the concert, but it did not arrive.My wife and I thought the concert was very disappointing. Russ Freeman is a great guitar player, but his playing that night was uninspired besides playing ""second fiddle"" to David Benoit.Benoit does have talent, but he overplays everything until you just get tired of listening to him. We could not wait for the concert to end.I received the new cd a few days after the concert and I immediately shipped it back - unopened.Sorry, folks, but this cd is a bore and a waste of money."
3,Just Like The First One,"This CD sounds like the first collaboration CD of David Benoit and Russ Freeman. If you liked the first CD, this one will be a delight to listen to.However, I was expecting something more that would make it stand on its own. In this regard, I was a bit disappointed."
3,Not nearly as good as the first,The original Benoit-Freeman Project CD represented two talented musicians at the top of their game; this one brings us David and Russ out for a smoke break. Benoit-Freeman II is full of instantly forgetable elevator music. Skip it.
2,Very disappointing,"I have the Benoit Freeman project I and I loved it. This one is slow, boring and a lousy example of the work of Russ Freeman and Dave Benoit. Don't waste your money!"
3,Audio Quality of Dubbed Video Dialogue,"My enjoyment of ""Spell Wars 01"" the much more dramatic continuation of the ""Sorcerer Hunters"" Saga was diminished by the poor audio quality of the dubbed dialogue. In order to hear the dialogue in was necessary to increase volume so much that the background music was as loud as the dialogue, drowning out the conversation. The eyecatch in the middle of each episode was now much too loud. I've tried this tape in both my 2head mono VCR and my 4head HiFi VCR with similar results. Anyone else have this problem? I wanted to check before trying to get a replacement. Maybe the subtitled tape this time!"
4,Raised Toilet seat,"Duro-Med Deluxe Plastic 5 Toilet Seat Riser, WhiteI was originally happy with this item until I scrubbed it down and it no longer fit on the toilet bowl securely. I can still use it but have to be very careful as it tends to slide around."
2,Where's the love in this love story?,"I must have read a different version of this book than the other reviewers. I have to admit, the style of reading kept me interested and hoping that things would work out for this couple. I just kept waiting and waiting for Trevor to do something nice, show a little compasion for Alana but it never came. She'd have to be a masocist to stay with him, he may have had a kind thought for her, but he never let on to her. FINALLY, at the second to last page, he WRITES her a note and says he cares for her, but even then doesn't fight for her. As a final disappointment, the subplots are never resolved. This could have been great, I was looking forward to watching them work things out, but they never really did. She was a blind fool not to take off with the brother."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I read thought the reviews of this book and I couldn't believe that there were actually negative ones. I totally agree with the gal who said she'd read tons of romance novels and this was her favorite. Out of all the romance novels I've bought, I've only kept three. This was one of them. (The other two are Jude Deveraux' ""Knight in Shining Armour"" and Diana Gabeldon's ""Outlander"" - check them out!!!)I bought Lions and Lace back in '93 or so and just found it the other day when I was cleaning. Last night I thought I'd flip through it again - just really quickly ...and ended up reading the entire thing again, staying up until 2AM. It's just really well-written, the characters and plot are really interesting - and c'mon, how can you resist an Irish hero?"
5,Lions and Lace,I really enjoyed the characters and story of this title. I've actually read it more than once as it's that good. It's one of those you don't want to put down.
4,"Heavy, Heavy, Heavy, Heavy, Heavy.","This time around Wino and the boys take it slow, really slow and add a few layers of ultra-heaviness to the recording. On my first listen, I was a bit disappointed at the lack of melody and ""dirge-like"" tempo to most of the songs. I thought of Spinal Tap's ""Stonehenge"" about 30 seconds into the album. On repeated listenings, however, the album really grows on you. The slower tempos really set a mood; and enhances the listeners ability to hear and absorb the lyrics. There is also some tasty organ playing throughout which adds a bit of a psychedelic flavor to a few tunes. Most importantly, Wino rips off some of his best lead breaks in recent memory.All in all a worthy sophmore effort and must purchase for any fan of the band or Wino's music."
1,"5 stars for the music, 0 stars for Vagrant","Skip this CD and buy Paul Westerberg's ""Stereo"" CD instead. In ""Stereo"" you get this CD included, and it's the same price. The ""Stereo"" CD cover makes no mention of this, so I bought both. Now I have two copies of ""Mono"". Shame on Vagrant Records for this pitiful packaging."
3,Sure it's a good record...,...but compare it to the first five Replacements' records and it blows. And please don't use 'rocks' in your reviews.
4,"Best Since ""14 Songs"" or Possibly Even ""PTMM""","Given that it was apparently a lark, ""Mono"" is quite a bit better than I expected. It's a solid, rockin' little album--nothing to take too seriously--with several catchy songs and, in my mind, only one minor weak spot: ""2 Days Til Tomorrow."" It's better than ""Eventually"" and ""Suicaine Gratifaction"" and may even be more consistent (not to mention fun) than ""Don't Tell a Soul"" or ""All Shook Down.""The whole ""Grandpaboy"" thing is tough for me to figure out. I guess right now that's his way of resolving the ""rock band"" side of his dual artistic personality. In any case, for Paul/Mats aficionados, this is worth picking up."
4,"The best Rolling Stones CD since ""Some Girls""!","Grandpaboy is Paul Westerberg's not-so-secret side project. As the liner notes say, this is ""rock and roll, recorded poorly..."". But the distinctly lo-fi vibe suits the casual manner of these songs. They're mostly mid-tempo guitars/drums/bass rockers in the same style as 1970s Stones or Faces. Nothing here is as instantly memorable as Replacements songs like ""Valentine"", ""Sixteen Blue"", or ""Left Of The Dial"". But the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. And there are classic Westerberg lines like ""Your eyes like sparks and my heart like gasoline"". Let's hope that the forthcoming Westerberg solo album is this enjoyable. And for God's sake Paul, please go on tour!"
5,"I'm in love, with that song","Wow, I haven't felt this good about a record in a while. I like a lot of PW's songs: many of the mats tunes, many of the solo tunes. Fast, slow, they all can be good songs. But, somewhere down deep, I think many of us wondered if he would ever put out a simple, rockin' record again (somewhere around the PTMM mood). This is that record. It's not the mats, it's not a carbon copy of his other records. But it is great rock record that makes me smile everytime I put it on. Plus, it grows on you in a big way. Play this record loud!"
4,Liebler's poetry brings out the magic,"Having heard M. L. Liebler read and perform his poetry with his Magic Poetry Band, it is hard to get his performing beat out of your head when you read, Written in the Rain. The poems in Written on the Rain are pure hard hat and lunch pail examples of the American working population. I love the poem Allan Ginsberg's Dead. It speaks to the heart of Liebler's poetry. A man who worked, loved and died without any recognition, but is the backbone of America's success. A Bag of Catsup, And I Ain't Never Going to see Bobby Rush No More and Bass Beat Blues are all poems that show the twenty-year journey Liebler has taken through life and with his poetry. His topics include Vietnam, Unions, Baseball and Christ. A must read for those of you with the Midwest in your blood."
4,Heartache in Miami,Wow what a page turner. After having read all of the previous Suspicions this one left me thirsty for the next one. The ending leaves you feeling empty and incomplete. The murderous plot is exciting but what gives the book it's richness is the relationship between Gail Connor and her sizling lover Anthony Quintana. In this Chapter of their relationship you see the frailty of what has become a tempestuos relationship. Both of them are so overcome by their passion that neither one of them can think straight. I found myself wrought by physical heartache every time Gail and Anthony blundered into another act of betrayal in the name of love. As a cuban american living out west this book left me longing for the sounds of Miami. The descriptions of the exiled Cuban community are right on. A must read especially now during the Elian crisis in Miami. May is too far away to wait for the next installment. Please Barbara but and end to my heartache.
4,Great story,"This was my 1st book by this author, and it won't be my last. I really enjoyed this story, and found myself hurrying to get to the end to find out who the villain was. I found all the ""cuban stuff"" a little boring at times, but other than that, I thought this book was great!"
3,Suspicion of Betrayal,"After reading all of Barbara'sbooks, and thoroughlly enjoying getting to know andlove Gail and Anthony, I wastruly dissapointed with thisone. The story itself was goodbut I was totally rocked withher ending. I actually wroteBarbara a letter and she didresond to it! Gail and Anthonyare both strong willed and independent and for those of you who have not read about them please assured that theyhave overcome different obstacles in life and for those of you who have enjoyedher in the past as much as I have, be aware that Barbara will bring them both back. Thank Goodness!"
3,more miami vices,stereotypic relationship between headstrong yet clinging divorcee on the rebound and insufferably macho cuban fiance. well drawn miami setting for a plodding plot.concludes with the door open to a similarly dysfunctional sequel.
4,This book starts off well but the ending is flat.,"""Suspicion of Betrayal"" gets off to a good, if somewhat conventional start, with (something new!) a spunky female lawyer who is in trouble. She's got a precocious daughter, a troublesome ex-husband, some threatening phone calls and a hot-blooded and overbearing Cuban fiance. Boy, does she have her hands full! Parker juggles all this well enough for a while. Unfortunately, as happens all too often in this genre, the ending falls flat. Parker introduces a stock psychopathic character as well as a ""Perils of Pauline"" situation. Will the spunky heroine survive? Well, duh! The ending doesn't satisfy and the solution to the mystery isn't terribly enthralling. Parker has talent, but she has to nail the ending to get top marks for her novels."
2,Should have stopped reading...,"The entire time I was reading this book, I kept asking myself, ""why are you still reading this."" The characters were insipid and shallow. Don't waste your time reading this."
3,No Mystery Here,This is a good read for an amature sleuth in need of an easy case to solve case. Its predictable story line was not helped by the consistent stupidity and shallowness of the central character and her type cast compadres.
2,Plot not believable,"While the book was well written, the plot was extremely predictable. The first mention of the kitten, I suspected what was going to happen to it and was right. The villian was also easily recognized (not to give plot away, but, sorry, it's just too obvious - the second time she was mentioned, it was blatantly obvious - which ruined the book as there was no more intrigue. Plot would have done better if villian was not mentioned as often as she was - by the final time, even my cat could have figured it out). And total switch of character Anthony was too far - in previous books he was always depicted as straight-shooter-stand-up-type-of-guy - now he's a crooked abuser - just way too far on believable scale)."
2,Do not recommend if your using Visual C++.net Standard,"I thought the the first chapter on the overview of the .NET frame work was very good. When I got to the 2nd chapter on managed C++ basics, the book refered to using a command prompt window provided by Visual Studio.NET for compiling programs. I could not find any reference in how to display that window using the Visual C++.net Standard edition.So if you dont want to shell out the money for Visual Studio.NET, then do not buy this book."
5,Great Book (Correcting misinformation),"A reviewer stated that in chapter 2 there are Visual Studio .NET commands that are not found in the Visual Studio.NET Standard addition.Hmmmm this confuses me... the only commands used in chapter 2 are standard .NET Framework commands and have nothing to do about Visual Studio.NET. Maybe the reviewer should contact the author and ask for help before posting misinformation.Though, it is true that a few of the features covered in the book are Enterprise specific, creating SQL 2000 database within the studio comes to mind (but there are free downloadable workaround to this.)All in all, a great book about Managed C++!"
2,Elementary,"This is too elementary, if you want to learn C++ this is the book you need to have. For a more advanced real world application and web services development look elsewhere."
4,Cousins aren't always kind...,"I've been reading Little Critter books since I was a kid and now am enjoying sharing them with my children. They continue to be pertinent to issues that children deal with every day. My 3 year old son keeps asking for this book at bed time. It's not my favorite Little Critter book, but I think it's just because it deals with difficult, more painful issues, like bullying. Last night while reading it to my son I realized it perfectly describes the opposite of Paul's letter to the Corinthians ""Love is patient..."" so I'm going to use it for my preschool Sunday school class. At some point, everyone has either been the Little Critter or the bragging ""My bike is faster,"" poor sport older cousin, and this book does a good job of teaching empathy and how to manage when you're the little one."
1,Doesn't fit properly,"Looks exactly the same as the original filter but the ""donut hole"" in the center is too small, but only slightly. I may get a hammer and force the issue."
5,KEY LIME JUICE,This is the very best Key Lime Juice in the world. I make lots ofkey lime pies and this juice is tart and wonderful.
1,Boring,"My husband and I visit the Florida Keys quite often. We always make sure that we treat ourselves to some wonderful Key Lime Pie. In the past we have always brought home fresh Key lime fruit from some market in Key West. Due to flight regulations and restrictions, we were unable to bring it home this past December. So I decided to purchase some online and this is how we found this brand and used it. It was a real disappointment.The juice tasted like any ordinary lemon juice and lacked that floral bitter tang that Key Limes are famous for.I don't know how this brand can call themselves the famous and original.The juice is from concentrate and who knows what kind of process it went through but it definitely lacked freshness and I will never buy it again."
1,Misguided Romance,"This novel seems to find romance and intrigue around the concept of statutory rape in same-sex relationships. No doubt many young men would benefit from a positive gay role model, particularly in a small town without family or community support. But because of the strong potential for abuse, the law prohibits these relationships from becoming sexual. Mr. Mann would have us believe that Wally's sexual relationships are virtuous and that the law of statutory rape is misguided. There may well be stories where the effect of this blunt law seems unjust. But that story isn't All-American Boy, which, if anything, just illustrates a cycle of abuse around stero-typed characters."
3,Not the usual from Mr. Mann,"This is a book about breaking cycles, resolving issues, forgiveness, living up to (and failing to live up to) other people's expectations, and freedom. Compared to most things William Mann has written (which are usually not even good enough to be beach reads), this one isn't so bad. As another reviewer noted, if you're looking for another silly gay party boy story from Mann, then this isn't it.The plot: Wally Day, a failed actor, returns to his podunk hometown to care for his senile mother. While there, he revisits the events that led him to get his friend Alexander jailed on child molestation charges. In the meantime, he spends time trying to find his AWOL cousin, (whom his mother thinks she killed and buried in the back yard) and fending off the attentions of a 16 year old boy. This is one of those stories in which the flashbacks are almost more important than the present day story. Better than some of the things I've read recently."
4,A dark and tragic departure for Mann,"What a change of pace this novel is from his circuit part boys shennanigans. This is a much more complex, dark and heartbreaking tale of a family - mostly mother and son - coming to terms with their demons and their mistakes in life. The mother's story and background unfolds as the main character moves the the present trying to figure out what he wants and why he's returned home after a call from his mother. Mom's background unfolds as an aching and epically tragic life. The son - really, has not fallen far from that tree. Not a happy, carefree story, but a haunting and moving one. Actually, a welcome change from his last novel."
3,Depressing Yet Insightful,"Mr. Mann has written a novel that speaks of some of the very sad aspects of many gay lives. The main character, Wally, endures some dreadful encounters with his homophobic father, while his mother who is sickly has probably murdered his cousin. In addition, Wally returns home to visit the man who molested him when he was a child (with Wallys consent). Wally's dad has the guy locked-up. Turns out Wally loves the guy. While home he meets Dee, a younger guy with whom Wally becomes involved. Dee was a well-developed and interesting character and I would love to see him return in a future Mann novel. The book was an OK read, but a far cry from the author's previous works, ""Men From the Boys"" and ""Where the Boys Are."" These were outstanding in comparison to this new piece. This book was somewhat disappointing to me as Mr. Mann's earlier work was so, so good. Hence my rating of three stars."
3,All American Boy and His Mother,"Despite William Mann's title, this book is just as much, if not more, about the All American Boy's whacked-out mother, Regina, as it is about Wally Day. And that's a weakness. First, the scenes with Regina and Luz and Jorge are repetitious. Second, the central mystery -- where's Kyle and what, if anything, did Regina do to him? -- is never resolved. Then there's Wally and Zandy. Is what happens at their reunion a dream, a fantasy or is it real? Who knows? If it is supposed to be real, it is shockingly irresponsible. And how coincidental is it that Zandy passes on while Wally is conveniently in town? Wally's relationship with Dee is necessary to make the story come full cycle, but it is still disturbing. And maybe, just maybe, that's Mann's point: make this story different by making the title character and ostensible hero a reprehensible jerk. If that is the intent, then Mann succeeds. And he succeeds in making the mother one as well."
3,Not so much about the All American Boy,"While portions of this book briefly addressed important issues related to relationships between people of different generations, I found myself wading through mounds of useless monlogue about the mother of our ""main character"". At times, when dealing with Mrs. Day, it was difficult to distinguish between past and present events. Her character made the story tangential. There was also Mrs. Day's ongoing murderous subplot that ended anticlimatically.When the character Donald, or ""Dee"", arrived, I thought the story was about to begin. I was wrong. This entry provided little more than a brief reflection into Wally's past, similar, circumstances and the potential for a better written sequel.Mr. Mann obviously put a lot of effort into this book. Perhaps a more esoteric reader could have found and followed his plot, but, in the end, it had totally escaped me.Thank you."
3,"It works well, but...","The cart came out of the box bent, and some of the pre-assembled parts were assembled incorrectly, so the cart wouldn't even open. The cart had to be partially taken apart, in order to be assembled correctly and according to the directions. Disassembly and assembly were VERY frustrating and time consuming, so that is why I knocked off 2 stars. I have used the cart a few times so far, and I do like it. It seems pretty sturdy and the wheels look like they will last."
3,Not very firm or specious!,This product is not a bad product but it is not great either. It is not very firm or specious. I would check similar products before ordering it
4,Great cart,"Easy to put together, seems pretty sturdy, looks great in red, it's not ""your grandma's"" cart. I also bought a liner, which is a great addition to it."
1,Smell!!!,"The cart it self is fine , the horrible smell from the wheels are extremely upsetting. We have to keep the cart outside due to the almost poisonous Oder. I have a 20 month old grandson and I am afraid of the toxic oders. Possible the company could use other wheels as the cart itself is great!"
3,Could have been better.,"Not one of Tim Burton's best.But if you have collected his other books on the art of his movies, you will still want to buy this too.You'll still get a good if not great book."
2,Very Dissapointing and Mistitled,"The first thing I noticed about this book is that how unappropriately mistitled it is by calling itself ""The Art"" of Sleepy Hollow. What I saw instead is the unentertaining shooting script printed superimposedly on the so-called 'conceptual arts' and stills from the movie.I was expecting a book with a feature of something like The Art of The Matrix. Being a fan of moviemaking conceptual artistic designs, I found the pictures and still photos to be blurry and in some cases 'artless'. What a disappointment for a book based on a really atmospheric and visually stunning approach."
2,whats this?... hmmmm close but no cigar...,"Dont think this is a ""making of"" book. It aint! In fact its just the script added some lovely pictures and stills from storyboards, the actual film etc... All very nice...but why are there not anything about the production? cast and crew info?, behind the camera stuff? interviews with Burton, Depp etc? All in all this is a fairy poor book... sure the picturs are nice, but some text would have been nice also... And yes I am a die-hard burton fan... But if you are a huge Burton fan (like me) then its of cource a must have, but the rest of you will probably find it quite boring... Had it only been a litle more like the wonderfull making of book about Tim Burtons The Nightmare Before Christmas...If you dont already have that one then get it now! Its an amazing book..."
3,some what disappointed.....,"i am a big tim burton fan and i love this movie so much. however, the title of this book is misleading. i have book on the art of nightmare before x-mas, as well the art of mars attacks. both of these titles give you a glimse into what went on during the making of these films. the art of sleepy hollow, isn't like that at all. it is the printed screenplay, with stills and production sketches from the film. it's a nice picture book for a die hard fan, but its potential to be something better, makes it disappointing."
2,It lacks box office draw,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVED this movie! And I'm a big fan of Tim Burton and his visuals. But this book doesn't accentuate either of the above. The illustrations are not very exciting and the book lacks tons of actual still photos and behind the scenes shots. At least I got it for free. I was hoping for something similar to the Bram Stoker's Dracula book that came out shortly after that film. That book and script was exceptional and captured the full beauty of the movie. This one (though the script is included) does not do the same. A shame because I love this film."
4,The Epic Life,Four Souls is an account for four young men who embarked on a worldwide adventure in search of the 'Epic Life.' I was challenged and inspired by their journey. I will never think about what it means to live in community the same way again. I highly recommend it for anyone who has asked the questions: Why are we here? What do I have to offer the world? Is there something bigger than myself?
3,"Good, but doesn't go far enough","Although this book is full of great stories and lots of interesting insights, I didn't walk away from the book sensing any passion or call for the rest of us to radically change our lives to serve others--which I thought was an important missing element. I am still unclear how this experience has changed the authors' lives and what has happened since. Issues of race and gender (especially in South Africa) were glossed over and told from the perspective of majority folks. In addition, if you are not a politically conservative evangelical Christian, the authors' digressions into views about women, marriage, wealth, and ministry are somewhat offensive. Overall, I thought the book raised some interesting questions about what is true work and true service--my conclusions, however, are different from the authors."
5,Hoodie Bear,"Cute bear, good delivery time. It was not the bear I ordered but mistakes happen and I didn't take the time to send it back. I do love Amazon.com so no problem there. Thank you!"
4,Ase! Ase! Ase!,"If you are a novice and just beginning to tap into the music of the Orisa..This CD is a wonderful experience. I recommend this and ""Bembe"" by Milton Cardona to help you learn the songs for Orisa. It's apart of the worship of Orisa to learn the songs and dances.. so go for it! Enjoy! Odabo!"
3,A copy of better compilations,"this cd is an extract of lasaro ross work, so if you have the other cd you do not need this one, no new music, no new preformers, but since comes from other recordings it is good music."
2,Not ready for OSX,"Norton Utilities has saved my data in the past, circa Mac OS 7.5. However, recently a HD with 3 partitions failed drastically - Disk Utility in OSX saved #3, Norton *couldnt even see* the other two partitions, yet alone do anything about it.Booting into single user mode and running fsck however showed all three partitions (Mac labels and BSD /dev/... paths), diagnosed the problems (Bad Super Blocks) and is fixing them as I type. Save your money and learn how OSX really works under the bonnet - you'll be richer and smarter for it."
2,"Might be great, but exhaust all your free options first","Joe Celine's advice above is great. I spent all day trying fix a hanging login screen. Just as I was trying to decided whether to plunk down the cash for this or Disk Warrior, I decided to come home and try ""fsck"" first. Worked like a charm.Log into OS X in single-user mode (by holding command-S while booting up). At the prompt type ""fsck"". Follow the prompts, if any. When you're done, type exit and hit the enter key. Hopefully you've saved yourself enough to buy all those books on your Amazon Wish List now! Good luck."
5,Improved version of a Mac essential.,"I've used virtually every version of Norton Utilities since I started using Macs both at home and at work about a dozen years ago. Recently, I upgraded my home computer to a PowerMac G4 with OS X, so naturally I also upgraded to version 7 of Norton Utilities. So far it works flawlessly. Although Macs have fewer crashes and other problems than PCs, they do have problems occasionally -- and over the years good old reliable Norton Utilities has fixed virtually all of the few problems I've encountered. This latest version is as smooth and reliable as it's predecessors, and it works on both OS X and the ""classic"" OS 9.2 which are on my PowerMac G4. I can't imagine having a Mac without Norton Utilities, and this latest version is no exception.."
1,"ivgstores doesnt even stock them, buy somewhere else","waited 9 days for this to ship from ivgstores, they lie and lie and lie they dont even stock them, pay the extra 3 bucks from other honest sellers and go that route, these guys are terrible!!"
1,The wrong kind of blast,"Don't judge this one by the cover. It looks like the disk is of Ella singing with Duke Ellington's piano accompaniment. Instead it is an Ellington big band playing as loud as they can and Ella belting 'em out - trying to be heard. I had hoped to hear the beautiful, clear voice of a younger Ella and sure didn't get it with this concert recording."
2,Only if you need the form factor,"The industrial design on this product is great! Compact design, and a slick folding antenna.The driver/software support is horrible. It took me 2 days to get it working with a Sony VAIO. The software install disk failed and I had to manually install the drivers and the documentation provided was poor and didn't cover all the properties settings for the drivers.The worst problem is that Linksys claims this product is ""hot swappable"" which is a half-truth. You can plug it in and it will activate, but if you unplug it, then plug it in again, it will not reactivate. If you check the Linksys support FAQ, they admit ""You may require a reboot after unplugging the device"". Hardly ""hot swappable""..."
5,WUSB12 for TIVO (Humax 80MB DVD Recorder),This product worked great. Hopefully this will limit someone else's time spent figuring out which adapter to use.
4,Ease of use,Easy and very convenient to use space saving adapter which makes it very convenient to use with TIVO and excellent lock on.
3,Got a bad one....,"I bought this adapter to work with other Linksys wireless products. The range is much worse than the WUSB11, love that product. I tried installing it on Windows 2000 and worked with support for near 2 hours and they still could not get it to see the Internet. It could ping the router and the DNS server but could not ping yahoo.com nor see the internet. The support people were not very polite nor customer oriented on this one, I called at midnight on sunday so maybe that had something to do with it.My experience with Linksys support suggests that they will want to blame the hardware as fast as possible. This is good for customers and returns but horrible for the company. I really like my networks that I used Linksys for but I would prefer better support and website driver download."
5,No problems.,"I really like it. I have several versions of Linksys wireless adapters for various computers. All work great, but this is the easiest to use, since it is USB."
5,Super Dreamy,I didn't have to do a damned thing but plug this baby into my TIVO and it started working. Super dreamy.
4,Good collabrations!,Mariah has done another excellent job in here. Her voice mixed very well with the Irish boys. Loves it.
1,Really poorly done,"This dvd shows no more than 15 seconds of Nirvana in performance at a time before the music is interrupted by ""music writers"" yammering incessantly about what most Nirvana fans already know. The title of this dvd makes you think you can watch it and sit back and enjoy Nirvana playing songs and being Nirvana. That DOES NOT HAPPEN in this video AT ALL."
4,For Extremely Fine Detail,"Well crafted, and neat design where all the files store in the handle. Unfortunately, that means the files themselves are so thin and delicate that they are only suitable for extremely fine detail metal removal, and would probably work much better on soft plastic or wood.Just as an example: If you wanted to file down a notch in a house-key to make it fit a lock better, you'd be sitting there about 10 minutes trying to do it with this.The thinnest of these files is about 1/16"" in diameter, and if you aren't patient and apply too much force to try and work rapidly, you will break them.I have no complaints about the quality of this tool, I think I simply purchased it for the wrong application, but it may prove handy, so I'll keep it around."
3,Cliff Notes : no what I expected,I thought it was difficult to work with. Would have preferred a capsulated version. I didnt have the poem in front of me - wanted to explain the story to my grandaughter before watching the movie
1,I loved this light- until...,"I have 4 of these lights. I was in love with them and bought two more at the end of last year. Then two lights, both almost 4 years old, suddenly went dead within a couple months of each other. The ballasts went bad right around the same time, and the replacement part recently doubled to about $60.After contacting Coralife twice, I have yet to hear from them. I'm suspecting that the ballasts are designed to go out every few years."
4,"""free my soul"" music","I'm not going to join the debate on whether the Clarks are better now or better then - I don't know if the lyrics are ""deep"" enough or if the music rocks enough. What I DO know is that this CD is totally fun to listen to! My favorites are songs 1 - 7 and when I'm hitting A1A with the windows down, sunroof back, sun beating down, the ocean at my side and this CD playin', life is close to perfect. This is feel good music - the stuff that makes you sing along out loud. And I can't sing. Doesn't matter...I've worn my copy out and I'm about to purchase another..."
5,Great !!,I like anything that John McDermott does. I now have all his CD's. I love his voice and after reading about some of the things he does I like him as a person. Great CD !!
1,A Real Disappointment,"I was looking forward to this new CD but was seriously disappointed. The arrangements were poor. There was no particular reason for an a cappella Danny Boy. I'll Be Seeing You was all jazzed up, and I have yet to figure out what was going on with The Last Rose of Summer."
5,EXCELENTE QUALIDADE,"RARE CD Chris Montez. RECOMMEND THAT YOU ALL ENJOY GOOD MUSIC, ESPECIALLY COLLECTORS OF 60 YEARS. CONGRATULATIONS TO THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN."
3,Most of these aren't isometric!,"I enjoyed the isometric exercises my physical therapist taught me to rehabilitate a shoulder I injured at the gym, and I was looking for a book that would have similar exercises for other parts of the body. Although some of the exercises in this book will be useful to me, most of them aren't actually isometric exercises (my PT agreed when I showed them to her), and a few I won't be doing because they put the body in precarious positions and I am prone to joint injuries. It's not a bad book, but it's not what I was looking for and I wouldn't have bought it if I'd looked through it at a bookstore."
3,"Needs picture chart, not lists","I'm glad I borrowed this from the library. Many of the exercises are not isometric, and the exercises using weights make you wonder, why not just do a ""super-slow"" weight workout, or Joyce Vedral's ""12-Minute Total-Body Workout"" (book) instead?Also, why no picture charts at the end instead of the lists? The names don't all immediately bring to mind the exercises, and who wants to flip back and forth through the book all the time?Not as useful a book as it could be."
5,Accurately researched and gracefully displayed,"The book explains the differences between isometric, isotonic, and concentric exercises in fair and reasonable manner. It clearly demonstrates the benefits and drawbacks of isometric exercises such that the reader could apply what is beneficial and avoid the harmful effect of straining the circulatory system with longer stress of high blood pressure.The book displays photographs for a man and a woman and clearly shows the graceful posture and extreme flexibility and fitness of the woman compared to a stiffed and inflexible man. The contrast of the hair style of the two also deserves notice.The book's 184 pages are efficiently utilized to maximize the reader's understanding. After merely 27 pages of precise discussion of the subject of isometric contraction, the book turns illustrated with each page containing at least one or more photograph and relevant and clear text.Mohamed F. El-HewieAuthor ofEssentials of Weightlifting and Strength Training"
4,Recommended for only the strongest of stomachs.,"This book is literal horror. There is no hiding behind the supernatural or icky make believe monsters to be found here. The villian of this story rapes and kills little boys and Hautala does not spare the horrifying details. Parts of this novel will make your skin crawl and your stomach turn, but it is so well written that I cannot not recommend it."
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars....,"This is one of Hautala's most disturbing books; BE WARNED THIS IS NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH!!!!The story is about a villain raping young boys in a swampy atmosphere. I won't give away too much, but it isn't your typical slasher novel.Hautala is one of horror's most underappreciated novelists. Although a lot of his stories revolve around ghost story plots, I like him. He does not ""overwrite"" as often as a lot of scribes trying to make their point. His characters range from cardboard cutouts (quickly disposed of) to fleshed out ""creepy crawlies."" He has a knack for suspense without using the ""Gross-out Factor"" (although he can apply this at any time).Hautala is a solid writer who knows how to scare and get under your skin. That's the best compliment I can give a horror writer!!!"
2,Cute but cheap quality,These look really cute but I've had to glue them twice already. Overall quality was not good at all. Wouldn't buy again.
4,My son loves this.,It was for his birthday. Don't know how many fish he's caught on them but he seems happy with it.Mom
2,bobber with a brain,They don't work in the river they just lay on there side hard to see if you have a biteHaven't used in lake as of yet! So I don't know how they work thereSorry
4,She's nearly 60,"Although this may not be her best live set when compared to the Opera house or Berlin concerts, but boy does she entertain. This concert gives the listener a chance to hear her inter-react with her audience and it appears that she loves her London fans. She opens with a jabbing 'Georgia Brown' and her ever popular UK hit 'every time we say goodbye'. She then starts to have fun with 'My man' which is similar to her ""Fine and Mellow' album versionand somehow get's 'diamonds and my heart belongs to daddy'in it.She then wades into 'It don't mean a thing' where she impersonates classical, C&W, Dixie and Soul train music). It is really quite amusing. There is a nod to Carole king (youv'e got a friend) and a fast scat of 'Lemon drop'Her finale is 'Happy Blues' which is more of a happy talk along.I am a Ella fan and only regret, I did not buy this sooner."
4,It is what it is.,"Ok. This is not an amplifier to play Madison Square Garden with. It is perfect to warm up with, or to use (as I do) in audition situations in studio rooms for film and musical theater.I find it surprisingly loud for its small size, and have had no problem with the battery staying put. However, it does (the battery) run out a bit quickly.Again, this is a great convenience to pop in a duffle bag and use to warm up with, audition with (for theater/film)and practice on, if you live in say, an apartment and can't blow down the house with noise. I still have to tone the volume down in my place in NYC.If you really expect more than that for forty bucks, well....You get what I mean."
4,"Joseph Villapaz, MCP, Network+, A+, MOUS Office 97 Master","This text provides some essential networking information. However, this one book alone (or any single book) is not enough. There are many critical scenarios on the exam itself that only those with some experience may be able to answer. But as a test review book this is satisfactory."
3,Not Enough By Itself,"This is an ok supplement to the Sybex Study Guide, but by itself it isn't nearly enough to ace the exam. It also contains several errors which could have easily been avoided. The information is technically correct, but some of the answers are skipped, which one would presume, would rather defeat the purpose of getting this book in the first place. Basically, if you heve the Study Guide, you don't really need this."
1,one star is too many,"This film is unwatchable, despite my best efforts I could get only fifteen minutes into it. The script is comically bad, the situations are utterly dated, acting is lousy, perhaps due to inept direction. It seems as though everything was shot in one take, and both the image and sound are muddy. Was it shot on video, or 16mm film with onboard microphones? It seems pointless to speculate; the film was a total failure."
1,Not Worth The Time,This is a classic example of wrong stereotypes of the African-Americans. A disappointment.
4,gasa gasa girl,This book is good as far as development of the story. But some times is difficult to understand the japanese phonetic in the dialogue.
4,Solid Mystery,"This is the 2nd Mas Arai mystery but I read them out of order. I actually read her third mystery first and her first mystery second and this one last.As far as I can tell they are all about the same. The mysteries are complex and difficult to solve although the books are quite short. Except for the daughter, the so-called ""gasa-gasa girl"" the characters are interesting and unique. I read a review that her use of Japanese words and phrases was frustrating because she gave no definitions so I paid careful attention when reading this book and I did not find that to be the case here. Perhaps that was a problem with the first book. I think most people would find this enjoyable."
2,Sophomore Jinx,"Talk about a Sophomore Jinx! After what appeared to be a brilliant start with her first novel, The Big Bachi, Naomi Hirahara serves up this stinker. I don't know who should be more embarrassed: her, for writing it, or me, for previously recommending her.Some of the problems: a preposterous plot, unlikely clues, characters you don't care about (especially Mas' daughter, who seems anything but the promised Gasa-Gasa), gratuitous Japanese language insertions, unconvincing dialect, extended and tedious descriptions of the mundane (she persists in treating the subway as an exotic ""underground train"" and describing in depth how to ride it), and explaining the simplest things as if writing for a 12 year old.Stick to her first book."
4,A very interesting look at the Star Wars genre,"This book is very interesting, since it brings together the movies, the comics and the novels into one book. It goes over how the trilogy was conceived, and why it became so popular. It gives the reader an insight to the thoughts behind the creative process. The book also puts together many of the major novels and short stories in chronological order, and give a short synopsis/review of the titles, complete with rating. It also goes over the special additions, the comics by Marvel and Dark Horse, and the upcoming prequel. It ends on a humorous note, with 50 reasons why Return of the Jedi Stinks. Since this is an unauthorized book, it is honest and to the point. I would recommend this to any serious fan of the Star Wars universe."
4,A Refreshing View of the Star Wars Phenomenon.,"My first impression on the book was how it contrasted to all of the works authorized by Lucasfilm: it is very refreshing to get another point of view on the whole Star Wars phenomenon. I agree with the authors honest criticism of the Special Editions. For example, was it really necessary to see the wampa monster having a bloody lunch in the Empire Strikes Back? I guess that I am one of the few who thought the original scene was more suspensful because we hardly saw anything on the monster. The authors obvious despise of the ewoks of Return of the Jedi gets tiring after a while but other than that this is an excellent read. Before reading this book I did not realize that the word ""ewok"" was never mentioned in the film! I would recommend it to any Star Wars fan who has grown tired of only reading the Lucasfilm version (hype) of things."
4,The Fania All Stars' tribute to one of Latin Music's all-time giants.,"This was not the first or last time that the Latin Music world would pay tribute to such an iconic figure as the late Tito Rodriguez. Rumor has it that Johnny Pacheco and Jerry Masucci had originally planned to do this album with Tito Rodriguez as a special invited guest but time did not permit said dream's realization as Tito Rodriguez died of leukimia in 1973. Fania artists like Cheo Feliciano, Santos Colon, Ruben Blades, Justo Betancourt and Pete ""Conde"" Rodriguez (all of whom are featured here) all always cited Tito Rodriguez as a major influence and they obviously enjoyed paying tribute to him. Sound quality (even on the remastered edition) is by no means great but the original LP was not an audiophile-quality one, either."
3,Excel Formula and Functions book,"This book does not give me the simple functions in a readable way like most of the books I have had from the ""Dummies"" group. I probably did myself in, however, by not understanding it better. I once had Excel for Dummies and it was a wonderful book and I may just have to order that. I used to work with Excel a lot and I inentionally forgot it when I retired. I am working with the City of Ukiah in a volunteer position tha trequires that i make up a couple of spread sheets and I need to re-train myself with Excel. Chas"
5,Even Someone With Intermediate Excel Skills Can Benefit From This Book,"I'm pretty solid with Excel. But this book taught me some functions and formulas I've never considered. For example, the Offset function is something that I found very useful for some of the complex formulas and VBA coding I do. I recommend picking this book because it will take your Excel skills up a notch."
1,DUMMY IS THE OPERATIVE WORD,"This book is dysfunctional. The Dummies are NOT the Excel users. Many instructions so very, very early in the book do not work. The steps taken do NOT yield the same results. This is, in my opinion, a dysfnctional book like I have never seen before. I returned my copy."
2,Not Dennis Brain,"Dave Jolley usually plays the slower parts with care, feeling and a degree of precision, but when he has leaps to play or anything that is slightly challenging for the horn, he slows it down and takes the safe route. His tone is often uneven with some notes sounding fatter or thinner than others. I was anxious to hear Dave Jolley's recordings, but this is disappointing.Treat yourself to the classic Dennis Brain CD instead, if you don't already have it."
5,Child Focused Family Courts,"This book does a great job of pulling together, in a very clear way, all of the important issues facing families and the courts that must address their problems. It is concise and accessible but also contains a wealth of cited resources for additional information. It provides the model for what a child focused Famliy Court should look like."
4,Super,"Le DVD est arrive vite et il etait en parfait etat et lisible sur mon ""DVD PLayer"". J'en suis tres satisfaite."
3,very annoying,"almost endless non-stop music score like every walter disney's cartoon or movie production. very unattractive leading male actor who played 'aresene lupin', got a very crook-like goofy face, if not forced by the screenplay, rarely any woman would fall for this guy. the leading actress also acted badly. a screenplay threw in too many threads and characters, none of them well developed. nice cinematography with beautiful colors is the only achievement of this too hollywood and too disney modeled movie, the only difference is it's in french."
4,Simple,"Matt throught he had lost the love of his life, when Kaitlin was throught to have died in a plane crush. WHen Matt sees pictures of a woman that looks like Kaitlin, he goes to Mexico and find out that is her, and she is living with his enemy. Matt is glad to have her back, but can't get over that she was married to his enemy. Kaitlin had been forced to stay where she was held hostage. The two work through their problems, and reclaim their love."
5,The nail scissors is the business!,"I used the nail file at the hospital (my daughter was born with long nails!) and for the first couple of times afterwards and then switched to the scissors. I like the scissors so much more. It is really easy to use, I haven't cut her skin at all (thankfully!) and it leaves the nails smoother than with the file.I haven't found much use for the nail clippers or the brush."
1,Shop elsewhere for a kids kit,I had my eye on this for a long time since I love my Tweezerman tweezers... and I like the company's green and social commitment.... so I finally gave into temptation and bought this.Cheap China plastic.... clippers fall out of and slip around in the plastic handle.It is hands down the worst clipper I have seen or used. I have had two different Safety first clippers that are much better.The scissors are shaped in such a way that unless you child has super long nails... you'll never get a snip in.I guess the nail file and brush are o.k. but really would I have spent $30 for those?Shame on you Tweezerman for luring mother's into overspending for a useless kit.Follow-up: I contacted the company to voice my opinion... they emailed me back...apologized and said that they would exchange this kit for one of their other products... which I did... I think that is excellent customer service!!!!
4,So much easier!,"I bought these when my baby was less than a month old. She had started scratching her face and I HATED using the baby clippers. I could never see where her nail ended and her finger began. In a late night internet shopping spree, I broke down and splurged on this nail kit. It is awesome! The scissors make everything so much easier! I can actually see what I'm doing and I'm not worried about cutting off the tip of her finger. Of course, I still have to wait until the babe is asleep, but I can know cut her nails - a couple of times per week! - without fear.I've rated this product as a four only because I haven't tried out the nail clippers included in this kit. However, the scissors alone make it worth the splurge."
4,"Works Great, but Pricey","This item IS a bit pricey. But, I use tweezerman for my eyebrow tweezers and I knew that they sold quality products, so I decided to give this kit a try. I'm VERY happy with it. It comes with scissors, clippers, a brush and a file. The brush is pretty useless for a baby. I used the file when my daughter was just a couple days old because I was too scared to try the clippers or the scissors. The file worked fine, but you could probably use any old file. The clippers are quality, but are too big for an infant. It's impossible to clip their tiny fingernails without clipping their skin. That's where the scissors come in. The scissors are great--I started using them when my daughter was about 6 weeks old and they do the job perfectly. You have so much control with the scissors--I haven't snipped my daughter's skin at all. I will use the clippers when she is a bit older. I definitely recommend this product."
1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND A TERRIBLE PAIR OF SCISSORS,The new scissors were dull and a total waste of money. I called Tweezerman customer service to see what they could do to help. They said they were 2 weeks behind and I could FEDEX the product back to them (at my own expense) and they could get the product out only once they received it and reviewed the issue. They said they receive 12 bags of mail every day and were busy. What parent in their right mind would wait weeks to cut newborns nails. I'll find another company to buy scissors. I give these a 0 - over priced and you have to buy the entire kit to get dull scissors. PS - Amazon requires that you give a product at least a 1 - but I rate it a 0.
3,"Good scissors, cheap nail clippers",I primarily bought this set because of the scissors. The scissors alone were almost the same price as this set. The scissors are great - nice and sharp for cutting those baby nails but also rounded at the tip so they don't hurt the baby. My 10 month old LOVES to hold the nail file which has a teddy bear pattern. I was very disappointed in the quality of the clippers. They make a squeaky noise everytime you move them. They're made of a hard plastic that feels rather cheap. I also have another pair of clippers and prefer them (The First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Nail Clipper with Magnifier). I never use the magnifier but the quality of the clippers seems much better.
5,Excellent gadget,"I am very pleased with the Gruv-x transmitter. The radio frequencies are pretty crowded in Chicago, this product's ability to select any FM station makes it perfect for people living in large cities. This is a must have for anyone who uses an mp3 player to store their music collection. You do have to change stations occassionally to keep a clear signal but is not too annoying."
4,Better than the competition,"Bought this after trying the iRock, Sound feeder etc. Compared to others, this transmitter is the best. Mind you, not perfect but better than the competition.Few caveats: May not work well in cars that have rear mounted antenna (most Japanese cars). I get a better reception in my house than in the car. Believe me, once you find a 'good' (unused frequency), the distance is impressive. I use mine two rooms away.Pros:Small size, long battery life, can tune to any FM frequencyCons:Other than the ones mentioned above, the quality is shoddy so pray for a good piece. On mine, the LCD display lost some segments (when new) but comes back occassionally. Since I set it and forget it, I know what frequency I am tuned to.Good luck!"
1,Cendyne WIRELESS MP3 RF TRANSMITTER - do not buy,"I have seen the product on a different site but I ordered it from Amazon, because it was cheaper. It was only after it was delivered that I have read the other reviews (lesson learned!).The unit came with a deffective lid for the battery, the display does not work and the quality of transmission is extremely low. My radio barely picked up the transmission, when my laptop was 10 inches away! It is small and it looks good, but it does not work!"
2,Great Idea...but not enough juice.,"I live in the Twin Cities and no matter what frequency I set this transmitter at, I cannot get good reception. Last weekend I traveled out of the city to a very remote location, and I still did not get good reception. It is a great idea, but just doesn't have enough juice."
3,Great Stuff,"This is good lip balm, but I can't believe that I paid $14.00 for 3 tubes of Blistex. I swear this item was substituted for a greater quantity of the product which I thought that I ordered. I am not going to renew my Amazon Prime drop when it expires."
3,"Good product, terrible price","As I read on a previous review, I was lead to believe it was more than '3 sticks' of chapstick. I cannot believe I just paid $11.00 for 3 tubes of chapstick, when I could have gone to the store and purchased them for $1.50 each. What a rip off!"
5,Tiger uses his unique voice and style on this CD to the max!,"If you are a major dancehall reggae fan, then ""Ready Fi Dem"" , when translated means: ""Ready For Them"" is your album. Tiger -A.K.A. Norman Jackson of Kingston, JA. demonstrates his unique sounding growls and his uncunning UNIQUE style of ""toasting"" or rapping abilities on this album and will bring a big smile on your face. There are truly back to back hits on this one, such as: ""Mad Max"", and my all-time favorite song of all time, ""New Slang"". On this song, one truly feels the vibes and astonishing quickness of Tiger's toasting abilities & unique dj ability. It will also make you laugh for hours. I love this tough album & it will make you always feel irie or happy. I'm so glad to be the first to review it. Big Up Tiger!"
4,Easy to read keyboard....awesome for late night working,"I love my Keys-U-See keyboard. The white board with large black letters and numbers is so much easier to read. The only thing I would love to see are the flatter (quieter) keys instead of these raised ones but other than that, this is an awesome keyboard. It makes late night work at my desk so much easier on my eyes. Thanks!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this keyboard for 2 reasons, the Wake feature after Sleep, and what i thought were larger keys not just larger print. Well the Wake function does not work, right out of the box. and my fingers are having the same problem as with other keyboards - the keys are too small. I am deciding if I am going to return it."
2,Poor Quality Control,"I bought and returned two samples of this set due to a failed screen. This occured in both sets after only two weeks of use. They are made in China and quality control is nonexistent. I bought the set because of the great features and it did have a good picture (while it worked) especially with Progressive DVD. This was my first purchase of a Philips TV and will be my last. After the second return, I purchased a Panasonic 14"" and have had no trouble. The Panasonic has much higher quality of construction (made in Japan) and is very reliable."
3,From the Ridiculous to the Super Hip,"What was he thinking in recording ""Nature Boy""??? Sometimes I question Ray's choice of material...then he comes out and puts enough good stuff on an album to make it worthwhile.This album is essential for serious fans, but others will want to start with, among others, ""Que Viva la Musica"", ""The Message"", and some of the others from his productive Fania period."
4,Good book for in-depth miscue analysis,"I used this book for an in-depth miscue analysis for my dissertation. My methodologist was impressed with depth of the data, which showed some ground breaking results. Be advised, though, that this book supports two areas in the field that appear to be contentious: 1) at least 25 miscues are needed to perform a miscue analysis, and 2) nonsense words can be counted as syntactically appropriate. (I've since been repeatedly questioned on both areas.) I can't speak for the less intense miscue analysis procedures that this book also provides, but I highly recommend the book for the in-depth procedure."
1,Not User Friendly,"This is a difficult book to sift through unless you're using it for a class and are getting some training. It's not the kind of thing you can easily pick up and use. It's thick, unweildy and has a lot of information, but I regret buying it because I don't know when if ever I'll use it."
2,Will start to malfunction after few months of use.,"The idea of the lock is great to protect you engine and underhood components from theft and such. But unfotunatly this product will not last long. By daily use and over a small period of time the lock itself will start to loosen up a bit and you can't re-tighten it. Don't get me wrong, I have many products on my Jeep from Rugged Ridge and it's a pretty good manufacturer but they could have made this lock a lot more durable."
2,This was dissapointing,"I really liked Last Exit to Brooklyn as well as Requiem for a Dream. This book, however, seemed to drag on and on...the sex scenes were uninspired, the countless number of sexual partners that Harry had were not believable. Even the climax of the book had me yawning. And then the very predictable ""dramatic"" ending...YAWN.....Actually the entire premise of the book...that Harry needs increasing amounts of sensation in order to get his fix seemed contrived."
5,disturbing+wonderful,"I read this book and handed it over to my wife as soon as I was done. We both agreed on two points. One, it is the best written novel we have ever read, two, it would be a long time until we read it again.The best written novel? Well, the way Selby jr wrote the caracter Harry, you actually feel the way he is feeling in the book, long after you put the book down. If Harry was having a bad day, and I put the book down to go to work after a chapter, I was having a bad day. Selby jr writes so well, you feel the pain and desperation of Harry.I gave the book to my Father-in-Law, who devoures books two a day. He gave me the book back saying he couldnt finish it. It was too disturbing for him. You be the judge, highly recomended."
3,Um... okay.,"First of all, this isnt nearly as evil as the name implies. The book loses me about halfway through. It goes from going nowhere to trying to ""out evil"" itself. If you have read the synopsis, you have read the book. And that doesnt happen until the second to last chapter.This book grabs ahold of its own self loathing and holds on for dear life. Harry's constant whining about his desires make him an annoying narrator. But it gets three stars cuz I love selby. A better book about a similar subject (although not as well written) is a book called darkly dreaming dexter."
4,"Despair, addiction and downfall","An intense look at downfall. Like previous Selby novels, you feel the character. I have felt like Harry, we all have but maybe not to such an extreme, an for those that have, this book is therapeutic. A fun read which most is caught the first time through."
3,Selby tries too hard,"Selby is an incredible writer. This book is well written and has incredible description. It just drags on too long. You'll find yourself getting tired by the end of it. He has a demon and goes on a killing spree. Then more self loathing and description that goes on and on. Selby is one of the best writers to ever put ink to paper, but I enjoyed Last Exit to Brooklyn more than this. If you can wait and don't mind pages and pages of the same description, you'll enjoy it. The end is depressing and if you like a happy vibe, do not read."
3,enough to keep your attenion...i guess,"I bough this book based on the reviews of others. I recieved it with open arms and high expectations only to be highly dissapointed. it was enough to keep me reading, but not enough to really get me interested. i basically got through it by making myself read on. Seemed to be retelling the same story over and over untill the last hundred pages, when the story finally changed to something different. A good read if you like more serious novels compared to humerious. Not as disturbing as some reviews lead on."
4,The Demon,"This is a great book by Selby, Jr, although it is not my favorite. I love The Waiting Period and Last Exit To Brooklyn."
3,An interesting movie,"No the greatest flick I've ever seen, but not terrible either. Bought it used and didn't pay much, so wasn't too disappointed."
3,"Peta Wilson's Performance - Outstanding. Everything else, not so much.","Mixed feelings about this movie. In general, it kind of sucks. But Peta Wilson makes the amazing most of a minor role. Her performance was quite moving. I would recommend this movie on her merit alone. The scene where she explains why she is having an abortion, and the scene in the operating room, were both quite moving. She shows a range of emotions in many different scenes and adept at making her character's motivations clear to the audience. Her role didn't call for such a depth of range, so it's all the more surprising that she put so much into it.Watch this movie, maybe on cable, maybe on DVD, and resign yourself to the expectation of a couple of wasted hours. But look for Ms. Wilson's performance to save the experience."
1,Not CRUSHABLE!!!!!!,"We ordered this hat to take along on trips because it was advertised as being ""crushable."" It came promptly, but did not feel or look very crushable. We called the company and talked to someone about that fact. She explained how to fold it for travel and assured us that it was supposed to be ""crushable."" We followed her instructions to the T, but when we arrived in CA and unrolled it, the brim had broken and the crown was permanently dented. To their credit they promptly refunded our cost plus shipping, but we are still looking for a ""crushable"" straw hat for travel (in an extra large)."
2,"Ozomatli, please learn Spanish!","I'm a Ozomatli fan, but the last song of this album is written in poor Spanish. It's a shame!They write: ""Cuando canto mi cancion, quiero inspirar mi gente con una solucion"" Wrong! ""quiero inspirar a mi gente"" is correct.Another one: ""Cuando sueño en la madrugada, ojalá que mi trabajo no es temporal"" Wrong! ""ojalá que mi trabajo no sea temporal"" is correct.But the worst is: ""trato decidir lo más mejor para el mundo"". ¡Es una vergüenza!Please next time you try to write in Spanish ask for help in another place. I don't want my children to hear that song because is so bad..."
2,Eh,"I took a chance on this one because Amazon recommended it based upon other purchases of mine.Not a winner for me. One or two cuts were pretty good, but overall this is one I rarely play. Not very inventive. Not much drive. Not of much interest."
3,"Music is good, but I will not spend a cent more for any more","I dig the music, that is, when I can play it......discovered that this CD is encumbered with DRM. It caused iTunes to crash and it wouldn't let me import the CD... ...I listen to all my music mostly on machines in home/work or on my iPod on the go/in the car... ...what a waste of money on a ""gimped"" CD... ...and I won't spend any more money on Ozomatli CDs, that's for sure."
4,See them live if you can!,"This band has grown with every new release. They take on new political and cultural relevance, but never forget that people want to MOVE! I've seen them live 3 times now, and they always bring the crowd to its feet within 1-2 songs. I dig their positive message of political activism wrapped up in danceable rhythms. Check them out if they come to your 'hood."
5,"Eclectic, Amazing","Yes, it is far better to see this band live, but this album does not dissappoint. I've been an Ozo fan for a long time and I really like the direction they took with this album. It is an eclectic mix of genres. I think the mix of the band members contributes to the mixing of musical genres in an innovative way. The sounds produced here from hip hop to ballads, middle eastern to brazilian are fresh and new. They are definitely ahead of their time, and I can't wait for the rest of the world to catch up to Ozomatli!"
5,Excellent accessory for Toshiba Handhelds,"If you want to maximize your efficiency without lugging around a laptop or a worse, an actual paper tablet, I recommend a Toshiba Pocket PC and keyboard accessory. It attatches very easily and can be used as a full size keyboard to enter information in programs like Microsoft Word and Excell, and is about the same size as your PDA when it is compacted."
5,Great!,This book is a great way to start a family night and teach your children about GOD. Great activities that connect with kids and help them understand all about GOD . Also helps the parent teach them and guide them through a family night:)What a great way to bring your family together!!!
5,Love this movie,"This movie is so interesting. The Mystery is going on in the background of the movie, touching each character but you don't realize it til it's right in front of you. It's done so well"
3,delay,"Long delay between channels when switching. Remote control too cumbersome.Too many ""bells and whistles"" I didn't care about.Very good picture."
2,Poor Design for a good TV,"Like another reviewer mentioned, this TV is marred by some design flaws. You should be able to start this TV in HD mode, but you can't. This is extremely frustrating if you're using this as an HD monitor. It always starts up in analog mode. You have to push the HD button on the original remote first. Only then can you use it as an HDTV. Frustrating! If you're using another remote to control the TV because it always means keeping the original remote around unless you have a learning remote. Also, the construction of the unit is rather poor. The power button on my unit sank into the button recess, making an expensive repair necessary. The panel covers on the rear of the unit are also extremely flimsy since the rentention tabs that hold them in place break way too easily."
3,It's okay.,"It looks good, and is decently loud. Not as loud as I expected, but for 50$ what should i expect. But it broke within the first month of owning it. I think it may have been from the way it was mounted. Would not buy again, but can't complain."
2,Cheap!,"It works, but quality is terrible. Mounting isn't exactly easy either. The air hose connection is on the bottom of the horns."
1,Breathtakingly self-absorbed,"From the first line of her first chapter, the author seems to resent being a mother. I found it hard to sympathize with her plight: she considered herself an artist, but then got pregnant by accident, and now is stuck being a mother. To console herself, she writes this longwinded and often tedious account of all the minutia she endures on a daily basis with two children in her charge. I feel for her kids who will one day read this and wonder why their mother was so ambivalent about taking care of them."
5,Big Rumpus a Big Treat!,"As a fan of Ayun Halliday's East Village Inky, I was anxiously awaiting the release of this book. I have not been disappointed. Although the book is not in Ayun's own handwriting (like the magazine), her voice is there, and it's as real and hilarious and vivid as ever. I was introduced to Ayun's work while expecting my first child, and I swear, this is every real mother's spokeswoman. Great next step for this extremely talented writer."
3,Medium Rumpus,"This book wasn't bad...But be warned, there's alot of run-on sentences! And the author quickly changes her thoughts and topics. Sometimes I wasn't ""getting"" where she's going with the story or what she was originally talking about! I do love her sense of humor and she seems like a fun person with an interesting life. But all and all, it was just a ""medium"" rumpus to me!"
3,So self-consciously hip,"I just didn't like or appreciate this book, which I ordered after reading and enjoying Ms. Halliday's ""Dirty Sugar Cookies."" The author seemed so intent on demonstrating that she was authentically hip or counterculture or unconventional. Instead of losing myself in the narrative, I kept wondering why she was trying so hard. Ms. Halliday is a good writer and I'll continue to read her books, but on the subject of motherhood, she reminds me too much of the passive-agressive mothers I see too much in real life and prefer to avoid in pleasure reading."
5,"Beautiful book, not Erma Bombeck-y AT ALL","Comparing this to the EB is unfair. Ayun is funny and smart in an ultra-self conscious, unselfconscious way, where Ermy B is smug & trite. Not to play favorites, but I'd choose Ayun's stuff in a second. And your mom will agree."
2,Ehh.,"While some of the author's words are touching and ring true (the excerpt on her daughter being in the NICU, for example), I found most of the book to be tiresome. Yes, we get it. You are so darn hip that you can't even bother trying to be hip. You are so hip that you don't care if your kids are dirty or if your daughter prances around naked in front of virtual strangers. You're so hip that you dress your son in your daughter's hand-me-downs and publish a ZINE in your spare time. Wow. We're all impressed with your hipness, your wry irreverence. You are so hip and so New York that we can barely stand it. Really, I can barely stand it. I'm gagging into my hand as I type."
5,Couldn't put it down,I got this book as a Mother's day present and finished it in two days. That is no small feat considering I have two kids under 2.5. I could relate to so much of it! There were moments when I laughed so hard I woke the sleeping baby on my lap. By the end of the book I was in tears. This is definitely a must-read for every mom. Ayun Halliday is incredibly articulate and honest in sharing her observations and experiences of motherhood.
4,The truth is finally told!,Here's the best endorsement that any mother of two young ones can give: I finished it! Ayun is so funny and engaging that I roared to the end despite the constant baby and child interruptions that she describes so well. This is one book about mothering that won't wind up in the dusty pile of half-read books that lurk next to the bed.
1,Not particularly helpful,"Very lightweight book. Lots of pictures, not much text. And the pictures are okay, but look like stage sets put together by designers, not places where real people live. Storage options suggested were not specific, but general and obvious. The most helpful section of the book is the outline for determining your storage needs. Unfortunately, the book does not follow through with solid information about how to address those needs."
5,I really like this mixer,"This is a great mixer. I have had a kitchen aid and I like this better, you have to give yourself time to get used to it, it works differently then the kitchen aid. I like how it is open, easier to put ingrediants in. You have more control over the mixing and the speed. You don't have to constantly scrape the bowl it has a scraper that does it for you while its mixing. This mixer is strong enough to knead bread dough without straining the motor. I am very happy with this mixer.Electrolux DLX-2000 Magic Mill Assistent Stand Mixer, MagicMill DX200 N24 Assistant"
5,The meat of the issue rather than fluff,I found in many of the GMAT guides that they glossed over number properties and focused mostly on tricks to the GMAT. What I loved about this guide is that it gets to the heart of the matter in regards to understanding Number Properties and the rules of the game. This alone helped me to speed up my problem solving since I didn't have to spend as much time plugging in numbers. It explained in depth the concepts that we should know intuitively but may not.
5,Manhattan GMAT has reversed engineered OG,"I have bought all the MGMAT strategy guides and plan to write a review as I finish them. I have completed Number properties guide and I have found it very useful. Before starting with MGMAT I had completed Priceton Review Cracking the GMAT and Kaplan Comprehensive GMAT. I would say that the above 2 books use concepts straight out of college textbooks. However MGMAT explains these concepts as tested by GMAT. It gives more concepts per topic instead of cramming up everything under 1 book. Every page worth reading specially about prime, consecutive numbers and average.Some people find it pricey but I would question if they cannot but these books for $18, how can they afford their MBA ?"
4,Good theory but no correlation with MGMAT CAT,"The book summarizes most of the GMAT needed theory involving number properties, including tyical trap-like questions. The excercises are straightforward, too. However, the problem I faced is that when taking the CAT exams (at the MGMAT website), the DS/PS test problems required three, four or five times longer to complete --even if you know how to solve them in advance-- compared to the problems in this book."
3,"Pretty good, but not great.","A pretty good mix, but not great. I thought vol 1 was better. Doesn't keep up with Louie Devito's Underground series. The mixing is a little ""soft"" for my tastes. I'll keep this cd around and play it when friends are over hanging out."
5,Lots of love here,"I was pleasantly surprised after picking up this book. Great design , meaty, fun, informative. It's sort of a scholarly book combined with a rambling read. Reeve enters the domain of love in various forms , eros, thanatos, sentimentality, pornography and covers it with many examples from movies and literature. There are gems of reading here, I started it thinking it might be another evil little boring book with a nicely designed cover and found myself hoisting up the chair and reading and reading and reading -- straight through in one sitting. I also like a book where when people are cited the notes are complete and clear -- they are here. You won't find it beach reading to be sure, there is no dominant story as in something like Fermat's Theorem. But neither is it pulpy schmaltz. Desire this book (a nod to Lacan) and enjoy it. I have no idea who this author is, ans surprisingly he or she is a philosopher -- a clear one at that! How oddly refreshing!"
3,Norton Ghost for Dummies,the item was less than what I expected. the item that I was most interested in concerning Ghost was the internal workings for setting up the use of drivers and what steps I needed to take create the original images which I wanted to archicve for later blowing back the images to the various laptops and desktops that I needed to Ghost. the material was woefully inadequate for my purposes.I would not reccommend this book .
4,A Glimmer of Hope,"In this period of dreadful music we are currently immersed in, there are a handful of people who are still making music the way it should be made. Neil Finn is one of those few. His talent became obvious with Split Enz and later in Crowded House. On 7 Worlds Collide we get a taste of some of those moments as well as some of his solo pieces. The guest musicians add an interesting angle to the performance but I think Eddie Vedder was spotlighted a little too much for a Neil Finn recording. The Split Enz numbers also could have been chosen with a little more discression. Still in all, a very good recording and proof that there still is some hope left for those of us searching for good music these days."
4,"Ladies and Gents, Neil Finn!","This disc is a great listen. Some highlights: ""Take a Walk"" with Eddie Vedder signing lead vocals, ""She will have her way"", Johnny Marr's ""Down on the Corner"" and nearly everything else. The only clunker is Lisa Germano's dirge-like ""Paper Doll"". (I'm not knocking Lisa...I just wished they'd picked a different song for the disc.) Worth owning, especially if you're already a Finn fan."
4,Back in the Day,"I've loved Neil Finn forever. And this album makes me remember why. His sincerity and twist of phrase is the best of anyone around. Sure it's a little unpolished and yeah the pacing is a odd at times but the gems shine brightly. The Smiths cover makes you long for the Smiths to be making great music (or just to hear Neil sing more of them) and the Johnny Marr song makes me wonder why this guy doesn't have some solo stuff out.Tim is Tim but he chills enough to blend as well as 2 brothers can when they're getting along. I have to agree, i was pleasantly surprised at Eddie Vedder's take on the Enz classics.Makes me long for the day when you could always catch a Neil tune on the radio instead of on muzak in the grocery store! Damn U.S. playlist"
5,Neil Finn- Experimenting,"This CD is one of Neil's best. He combines with well known musicians such as Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder and Radiohead'd Ed O'Brien and Phil Selway, among others, to produce an awesome mix of tunes from hard rock to the soft ballads. Neil combines the old classics from Split Enz and Crowded House with some new material to get a perfect mix that any rock lover will enjoy.Thoroughly recommend it!"
2,Dislike,"When I bought this product I was aware that there will be no peeling effect or anything like that because i read the review of other buyers, too. I thought there will be changes in 30 days like promised, but there was no change at all. I didn't see any changes of any sort. The brown spot that I have is still the same, no differece even a little."
2,"they where not very fresh,",Not Fresh at all & the liquid has some discoloration. I was not very happy at all.
1,Get a real Movie,"This isn't a good movie at all. You should stick with real movies, good movies. Gettysburg, Platoon, Patton, Glory, Sniper, Top Gun, Gladiator, Hamburger Hill, Full Metal Jacket, and Saving Private Ryan. Please save your money and buy something that you will really enjoy and be able to watch over and over again."
4,"An excellent book for ""chapter"" readers","The other reviewers are right about this book's readability.But I would also like to alert readers who love their books in short, encapsulated chapters to this book as well.Each transcribed letter ties into others, but the characters are painted memorably enough to allow lapses of days between readings.A great book for vacation or business travel."
3,Pretty good trimmer,"I am a barber of 20 years, and I always wanted to try Forfex products. I have been using my Andis outliner, and Styliner trimmers for years. I read the reviews here, and decided to give it a try. Well this trimmers are good not great. They are not as strong as I would have hoped them to be. They feel good in your hand though. I cut all different types of hair, this trimmer is not as good as the Andis trimmer for those sharp lines that most of us are looking to get. They are a good but bot as good as Andis. I am going to try to use the blade off of this trimmer, and try it on my Outliners I think the blade might be better."
5,Grandad's Old Tuba,"This book is an award winner. A classic. Children love it because it teaches self-worth & music, and it is skillfully writen from the heart by a very well versed author.Get this book! You will be glad that you did."
1,never received,I never received items because the order was cancelled three times. Once through Amazon amazon and twice through Summerset gliders.
1,Two Broken!,"I had the same problem as reviewer K. Dejong below; the weld on two of these chairs broke after a few months of use. The chair is manufactured in China, and there is no fix or replaceable part for this problem. Unless you only need a theatre prop, DO NOT BUY THIS CHAIR!"
4,Some of the Best Parts Were Deleted From This Movie,"This is one of the very best films of our time. Peter Francis James is a SUPERB actor.This is why I am not happy with the producers cutting parts out for the DVD. I always felt that the DVD would be preserving the best , well, this is not so. Some of the final argument was deleted. Would you believe that the final argument was actually better? @Barbara Marshall: Remember the part in the final argument when Thurgood said: ""The children go down the road TOGETHER, they play ball TOGETHER."" This movie was just too good for any of the parts to be deleted."
3,Directness At It's Best!!!,"I just finished this book and gave it to a friend. It is a very simple direct read. And that is what I like about the author. Veronica Parker refused to get bogged down in anything other than her characters, and I can respect that. I also liked that you will not find any profanity of any kind in this novel, not one. It is a story that many women can relate to, and one that many women should read. A good book for those that just want to read something that gets right down to it."
3,Weak at the top,The top narrowest section of the pole is so weak the it bends with little force. It arrived bent in the package. Manufacturer needs to reinforce that section.
3,"Adequate quality, but won't last for long-term use","I bought this flagpole to use while tailgating. It is definitely on the flimsy side, but it has held up through about 10 uses so far. Keep in mind that we haven't had more than 10 mph gusts at any time, and probably mostly 3-5mph breezes. The flag clips included work fairly well. This product isn't terrible at all, but it doesn't exactly convey a feeling of long-term durability either.Pros - light weight, fairly cheapCons - not suitable for any serious wind, likely won't last more than a year or two"
3,Foot cramps,This is a great fin except that the foot pocket is too short and after just a brief time I get foot cramps that I didn't get with my antique Scubapro Jet Fins.
4,Good plan to stick with,Pre- diabetic This is a good plan to keep my sugar level where it needs to be.Great for anyone to live by.
3,okay book,"Interesting book but the diet is too complicated. Unless you are into tracking and counting things I would not recommend this book. If you are interested in info, then this is a good read."
1,They ruined a great cracker..,The original cracker was one of a kind. It was distinct and different from everything else out there. The only thing close is NY Flatbreads. The new cracker is terrible in comparison. Not much else to say. They also need to change the picture associated with the product. It is fraudulent to show a picture of the old product and then ship the new one out to customers.
1,Not the advertised product,"JJ Flats has changed the recipes for their flatbreads. The old recipes are good, the new ones not so good, but the real problem is that the picture and product description are those of the old recipe (good) and not what was shipped (bad, very bad). NO stars."
3,Quality Goosebumps,"This book is a quality horror story for children. It is scary, but not too scary. It is not disgusting and has a story with a moral."
4,Good value video card,"With the releae of the AGP 8X MX440's, the price for AGP 4X parts have plunged. Since not many people have a AGP 8X slot, and AGP 8X only increases performance by about 1%, there is no real point, especially for low end MX cards, which does not need the extra bandwith.The MX440 has over twice the memory bandwith of MX420 with its 128-bit DDR(256-bit effective) interface.64MB of memory is more than enough for today's games. 128MB is not worth it since you can always enabled texture compression for games that use more than 64MB of textures.The only drawback is that this card does not support pixel shaders, which the Geforce4 Ti series have. While you wont able to see the pretty water effects and DirectX 8 tech demos of the GF4 Ti's, these features are not used extensively in any game."
3,cute but very high,"These boots make my feet look tiny; unfortunately, I'm afraid to wear them because the very high heel and lack of stability in the ankle make walking difficult. These aren't at all what I would expect from the brand-very little arch support, even less ankle support. For looks and price, they get a 5+. For comfort, about a 2."
4,Very cute! But not all that comfy,"These boots are really cute, and they make my size 8.5 feet look tiny. :)The only thing I don't like about them (and I was really suprised about this since they are Dr. Scholl's) is they aren't really very comfortable.I wore them for 7 hours, not all the time on my feet, and I was REALLY ready to take them off. The bottom of my foot was aching.BUT- They are so CUTE I will wear them again, probably often lol.I got oodles of compliments on them!"
5,Love this under-rated show!,"Friends told me about how wonderfully acted and written this show was. And they were so right. Funny, with characters you can relate to and stories that make the half hours fly by. In fact, I dare you to try to only watch one. Like a terrific novel you just don't want it to end. Matt leBlanc totally deserved his golden globe and the supporting cast is equally gifted. Bottom line: smart, fun great television."
4,Mommy likes it too,"My 2-1/2-year-old daughter loved the slightly mystical tone, the drama of the expedition and the battle, and the repetition of ""Leaf Men, Leaf Men, we are in need!""But for the parent who reads it every night for weeks on end, there's a very subtle story woven in the details of the illustration that's fun to piece together.The story occasionally seems a bit abstract, with some details left out (to my occasionally literal mind), but Grace didn't seem to miss anything, and she was thrilled to give it as a gift to a grownup who gardens--who loved it, too."
4,Classic Joyce,"Unusual story about an old woman who falls ill and her garden does too. An old lost toy tells the bugs that they must climb the tallest tree and call to the Leaf Men for help. The good, brave doodle bugs accept the challenge. Beautiful artwork, sort of a strange story but good - my son (first grade) likes it."
4,Best Childrens Book,"The book The Leaf Men by William Joyce is a great book for young readers. it is very creative and very exciting. This book is full of adventure. It is about a old lady who gets sick so the bugs in her garden try to help her. They get in fight with the Queen Spider, and won. The old lady was better and they lived in peace. This is one of the best childrens book I have ever read. William Joyce is a great writerand illustrator. In the story the pictures a wonderful. It is awsome!!!!!!!"
4,Sweet without the schmaltz...,"I bought this book when it came out. Being an avid William Joyce fan I was excited and could not wait till I got home to read the whole book. The illustrations and the story are top notch. Classic William Joyce and one of the last ones that he has done as a whole book with painted illustrations. Since then he got into the 3-D thing that didn't quite do it for me and I've not bought any of the Rollie Pollie books. Sorry Bill. However, the good news is that he has been working on some very interesting projects and I hope to see more soon. I think every die hard fan of his wishes he would return to the picture book form with a new hand paint classic. I for one hope that wait isn't a long one. A true storyteller with a visual style that has one foot solidly in the old, with a hopeful look at the new, filtered through Mr Joyce's talented brain."
2,It's not that great,The color looks different on line. It appears to be a deep brown. You need to apply two coats for it to look decent. Drying time is not to bad. It dries to a smooth finish. This nail polish is really thick. The application is not very easy because of it's thickness. I was hoping the color would be as pretty as it looked on line. I would not order this color again.
2,Good but expensive for its price,The red almost looks like black if u apply two coats of the nail paint. Its too expensive and not worth it.
5,Perfect for the Chicago girl in your life.,"This Nail Polish is a perfect gift for any Chicago girls in your life, especially those who are keen on our city's great history, or fans of the town's amazing soccer club, The Chicago Fire.Honestly, if you know a girl who loves the Chicago Fire, she will love this."
3,Opi Mrs O'Leary's BBQ,"Opi Mrs O'Leary's BBQ is a LOT more purple than it is red, which doesn't make it a bad color, it just makes it purple, which I wasn't expecting. It goes on rather thick, which is different from most cheap nail color. It was a very good price and I will surely find more Opi colors to try."
1,Ai NGO,"Too bad!! It is not like color in the picture! I totally do not like it. I want to return, but it is cheap, so I throw away"
1,AWFUL! BURNT BBQ IS WHAT IT SHOULD BE!,"I wouldn't even give this polish one star but no choice. This is the UGLIEST polish I have ever owned and I've owned hundreds of polishes! It looks NOTHING like the picture. I was hoping for a merlot type color and it looks great in the picture and figured with the good reviews it must be good. LOL! It looks like burnt bbq sauce! I applied two coats on one hand and it was just awful, there was nothing redeeming about this color at all. I couldn't get it off my fingernails fast enough! Will take it to my manicurist and see if they can use it at the salon as it is a total waste for me! ps... to anyone reading the reviews... this color looks absolutely NOTHING like the picture!"
3,"Love the Color; The Quality, Not So Much","This has to be my favorite shade of polish. It really is the color of a deep BBQ sauce and it's a perfect shade for day or evening. I would classify it as a deep red with a subtle purple tinge. That being said, while I own many bottle of OPI nail polish, it is only because of all the unique colors they offer. I think the quality of OPI is grossly overrated.The polish never goes on evenly in one coat and two coats seem to be too thick and cause chipping. No matter how I shake, roll or prep my nails for polishing, the color never goes on evenly; it appears almost swirly. I also notice chipping on the tips of my nails by the second day.Bottom line: great colors, poor formula."
2,not color as pictured,"this is more of a brown/pink if you can believe it, and the photo makes it darker then real life, not my style, gave away"
2,Slow shipper,I had to contact the shipper after I waited 12 days to receive the product. It was sent after that.
3,RAINBOW RULES!,"As a huge fan of Rainbow, this product was a disappointment. Why? There is no concert! For $35.00 fans deserve a concert, not just interviews. This is the bonus stuff you get on concert DVD's.The interviews are good, with JLT, but Bob Daisley gives essentially the same interview he gave on the Rainbow 1977 in Munich DVD.The most disappointing thing is knowing that there are the concert DVD's out there from the footage shown in this video. Graham Bonnet at the Monsters of Rock and several JLT concerts in Japan, plus the Straight Between the Eyes tour that only seems to be available on European electrical current.I have the Rainbow 1977 DVD which is awesome!! I also have every Deep Purple DVD released with Blackmore, (not the Steve Morse DVD). We as fans deserve more Rainbow DVD's as Blackmore will go down as this generation's Mozart, Beethoven, etc, The man is a genius pure and simple."
5,Awsome,"Had it before and needed a new copy, my disc got damaged. It is a great game. It's a great game"
1,Lowest compatibility!!!!!,These media will probably work on a lot of standalone dvd players however if you are like myself and have a dvd player that is somewhat picky with media (Philips) then this stuff is a waste of money. Yes the cost per disc is cheap but you have to ask yourself is it worth being out 100 bucks to figure out if these discs work on your particular dvd player.
4,Tastes delicious,"I've been taking this product consistently for 4 weeks now, and haven't really seen any results. However, I'm pretty fit to begin with and nothing in the last year has caused me to lose additional weight. I will say that I have two friends with sub 10% body fat (one male, one female), and they said that L-Carnitine is the only supplement that they take, which is what spurred me to buy this product. They use pills, but I got this particular liquid one because the reviews said it tasted great, and I thought I could add it to my coffee if it didn't. However, I was pleasantly surprised: this stuff tastes like vanilla whipped cream with no bad after tastes at all. I still add it to my morning coffee for fun, but have no problems shooting it by the tablespoon. I bought 3 bottles, so I'll keep taking it until I run out."
2,xtreme dissapointment,"Being a Halloween House Haunter myself I was really looking forward to this BUT try as I may I couldn't get xcited- Loose the xtreme label & it would be tolerable-Beginners WILL find some good ideas-in comparison to the amount of internet info from beginner to nutcase haunters out there this suffers from what most 'Homegrown"" videos do: Ownership Bias- we thought of it & shot it so it's fine- the video effects will make it look ""cool"" - try looking at it thru a viewers eyes - Intro was ok & then down hill -blood & dummy bit painfully long-power tool use was an embarrassment-poor safety & if a drill why not a jigsaw-the animated southern drawl narrator annoying-most of the ideas are an ok starting point & can be easily improved upon but weren't-what happens if your tv' DOESN'T have video inputs-how about a hair drier vs. leaf blower - with a 2005 copyright this should have been in the Bargin Bin"
2,"Avoid this ""used"" book sales company in the future..","This book's contents are good. I knew when I purchased it, that my copy was ""used"" but supposedly in ""good"" condition... Almost every page is underlined and marked up with highlighted text, underlined text, scribbled annotations.... Should have classified as simply as ""readable"" with difficulty... Very disappointed in this book's promotion...The book's content is good and has the high quality you expect of William Barry. Will probably try to purchase another copy which is ""presentable"""
3,Noisy shredder,"The noise when shredding cheese is like the food processor is going to fall apart. I tried carrots the other night, and it makes them to fine. Dorie"
4,Reminiscing the old Days with Clayton Mack.,"This is a book based on stories of the life and experiances of the Native American Clayton Mack as he told stories about his life as a Guide, Woodsman, Hunter, Fisherman in the pacific north west which runs parallel with that of a Frontiersman, However this takes place in his inviroment, his was not to open and tame a ruged frontier country but to live with it as those before him. Any outdoorsman or adventurist will surely learn something from his tales and adventures and will find them interesting."
1,I don't give lengthy reviews,"I will refuse to give reviews where I have to insert a minimum number of words. If you can't keep it simple, don't bother to ask me to do any reviews."
1,Company Officer 2nd edition,"Please hope your FD doesn't use this book for promotional exams, it is not worth the paper it is written on. The study guide gives you quizzes without answers and worded in such a way you cant proof your answer in the book. CD questions have wrong answers provided.Anyone who recommends this book has not read it, or has very little formal education.A disservice to the fire service."
3,Company Officer,This book is ok. Not impressed with ALL the theories but every little bit helps. Wish there were cliff notes
4,Company Officer,I purchase this text for a class I was taking but will keep it as a reference to use as a future resource.
3,good item but...,"Item ok. But a little big for me. Please, for clothes try to use a universal reference system for sizes (e.g. the real lenght of a sleeve from a given point) with the help of a graphic."
3,Bulky,"This is not what i am used to for a pair of barbed wire fence pliers. The rubberized handle is long and bulky, but should provide comfort. I prefer the channellock fencing tool."
4,"Super cool, great conversation piece","These glasses are great for sake but they are quite small (think shot glass). They are very delicate, one broke when i dropped it from about 1 foot above our table. That said though they look great."
5,The album for the perplexed,"You have been curios about Middle Eastern music. You thought you may like it. If only you could get an album that will lead you gently into the genre. This album is it. Perfection in every track. Begin with track 4; ""Dark Eyes"" and you'll be hooked on OFT forever! An unbelievable artistic accomplishment!"
3,Forbidden Love,"I seem to have the knack of buying CDs where I simply love 1 track (& play it to death) whilst giving the rest a lukewarm reception. And that's the title of this review!! FORBIDDEN LOVE or Track #12 ....Haunting, Passionate, Wild, Wistful, Wailing, Rebellious, Brooding, Resigned ... all rolled into one & just so beautiful.I find the fact that it was originally a Jewish song & nowsung in Arabic poignant too ... why can't folks in the Middle East just give & take from each other the way Artists do ? I firmly believe that truly good Music & Art is Beautiful & Pure....it transcends All races, All cultures, All divides & All religions.Even though I am a Tekbilek fan ... great respect for his multi-talented musicality & actually like his voice...Yeah....I'd still get this for that 1 track though .... Maybe one day OFT should compile all those rave favourites onto 1 disc...& then that would be guarantueed to go Platinum !!"
3,Progressive Salsa but not for everyone...,"This recording was originally released under the Cotique Label in 1979 as ""Salsa Progresiva"". This is mostly a vanguardist Salsa recording with few Latin Jazz elements (rare in that time with Mainstream Salsa). Most arrangements are greatly created and performed. Tito Allen, Ismael Quintana and Jimmy Sabater collaborate as singers in this project."
1,War of Worlds 2 and The day the Earth Stopped,A very poor attempt at a sequel. I was very disappointed in these movies it just a cheap shot and very low budgit just some off the wall company trying to capitalize on some good movies.
4,Easy to use,Had no trouble attaching my 2 flags. One of the sections does not stay tight. That's ok because I would never use it at full height. Easy to lower if it is windy
2,Chinsy,Was not very sturdy. Should have looked at the item more closely.Broke the first time we used it for tailgating.
5,So far so good...,"I purchased this flag pole to use at my tailgate at Texas A&M. Even though the season hasn't started yet, I have tried it out and everything seems to work fine. I was debating between the 14ft and 20ft, but glad I stuck with the 14. Seems if it would be any higher it would be flimsy in the wind. One thing I need to figure out is how I'm going to fly it since we aren't allowed to have a car in the park that we tailgate in. I figure a umbrella stand will work just fine though."
5,Quick and easy,"Compact light weight design. Extends in second, holds in place. This height appears to be about right, any taller and I thick there could be some support issues. Overall very pleased with the purchase, fair price and good product. There was a good breeze blowing, and the support was sound, was not heavy force winds, but it is portable for a reason."
3,Super Reader,"Simon Templar is in France, and has an incident on the road with a young woman. He ends up at a small local vineyard that is in financial trouble. The girl, Mimette requests his help. There is a family struggle over the place, and an uncle trying to find an old obscure Templar treasure on the property.Violence ensues, and the treasure is not what anyone thinks."
5,Omega Planet Ocean 2208.50,"The Omega Men's Seamaster Planet Ocean Chronograph Watch #2208.50 is absolutely superb!I am very pleased with this purchase from Watch Grabber i saved over $400 by buying it from the USA as it is far more expensive to buy here in the UK.it only took four days from the USA to reach me here in England by expediated delivery which i thought was pretty fast concidering the time difference & distance, Be sure to look out for the import tax rates before you buy from the USA when ordering from the UK as they can be rather extortionate.( but in my case it was still the cheaper option to buy this superb Watch in the way that i did)."
5,GREAT!,"I love this backpack. It is the one I take on all my trips. Very handy on the plane. Lots of room and different pockets, room for drinks, etc. I've had it for probably 5-6 years now and any that I have bought since do not compare...."
4,GOOD BOOK,"I have recently finished my CFD course, i took a project in modeling of fixed be isothermal reactor and first order reaction to describr a hysrodynamic of a particle during the chemical reactor. i found this book is intresting in this type of science."
3,Seven Days DVD,"Seven Days in Tibet had some great shots in it, but would have benefited from more narration throughout. The DVD focused on several areas of Tibet in very quick succession- a bit choppy. A slower pacing and interviews with local people would have added interest and needed detail.If you want a quick overview of the areas covered along with historical information, then this is for you. If you are looking for an arm chair travel DVD containing architectural details or daily life in Tibet, then this DVD will disappoint."
2,"Nice cover, nothing different inside","This is a nice book with lots of info and to many black and white pictures, it was recommended as better then the rest. I found it to be just the same. There are so many things to illustrate such as Specialties GH and Robergel accessories for the DS and other Citroens, yet all you keep getting is more of the same. As I said nice book but nothing new."
4,The Classic Citroens 1935 - 1975,"This is a fantastic read. The title is little deceptive with book covering the period up to 2000. Not for the light-hearted and best read, in my opinion, as a dip-in dip-out Chapter read other than for the somewhat serious historian. Great pictures [although all black & white] and contextual breadth inclusive of social mores. My Edition published in 2006. As a Citroen buff rather than historian I probably will seek a separate reference that addresses in greater detail the period beyond 1975 even if my little GS Pallas scores a mention in Reynold's book."
5,An appreciation for this book,"In searching for a vocabulary workbook to help my son studying for SSAT test, I stumbled into a very old edition of this book at a second-handed book store. I immediately recognized the value of this book. As you can see, English is not my mother tongue language, so studying English for me is a science. I like the way the book builds up blocks of knowledge and goes up from there. I studied it along with my son for six weeks, his SSAT test score jumped from 20 to 70 percentile. We still have a way to go, but I am happy that I found the right tool for our goal. I am looking forward to have my son taking SAT test. I know he will do well, and my English will improve at the same time. Double pleasure! Thank you Mr. Levine."
4,somewhat happy,i wasn't that happy when I look through the book because it had some writing but that may be the reason why it was 2cents but it looks like it in great condition. even though the writing is bothering me.
2,Not for AOL Users,"I purchased On-Track Internet Cleanup Version 2.0 and found it easy to install and very easy to configure. My first test was to check to see if it cleaned up my internet track while on AOL version 7.0. It did not. All of my history is very much intact.Customer Service was very responsive via e-mail and suggested trying various options outside the program. When these failed to fix the problem they forwarded me to second level service which then suggested I contact AOL 7.0.If I had known that this product doesn't work with AOL, I would have purchased it."
1,these things are junk,please do not wast your money on these regulators like i did . unfortunately from looking at the picture they looked like a nice solid unit so bought like five of them. They leak and fall apart save your money go with something else.
1,Not as described,"be aware!!! it is not a regulator......it is a paddle valve that does not regulate the pressure. I run 180 psi on my main line and wanted to use these for my two finishing guns in my spray booth. It starts the pressure at 180 and then will allow you to adjust it down when in use only, but bumps it back up as soon as you let go of the trigger."
3,"Fun, but be gentle with them","We've only played with these a few times. They are good for my 7 year old to see if he's interested in lacrosse. The sticks are the right size for him, but small enough that it is difficult for me to play catch with him. I just hope the handles last long enough for him to decide. They are ""bendy"" plastic. I haven't assembled the goal yet, but I don't think I'll be impressed with it."
5,Magnificent!,"I purchased this book several years ago in a quest for authentic recipes. As a first generation American (daughter of Italian immigrants from Northern Italy), I'd grown up eating mostly peasant-style foods at home, though my mother was quite a ""gourmet"" and excellent cook; it seemed that my father much preferred the simpler recipes from his hill town of Germasino with American variations. I found this book and was immediately riveted...the background information for the recipes and the authenticity appealed to me. I also own books by Julia Della Croce ... but THIS book is my favorite, and my family's, because of its simple and authentic fare. There isn't a week that goes by that I don't pull it off the shelf and ""commune"" with my ancestors through preparation of one of the dishes!"
2,Too many points to heal,"I bought the book after a practitioner used this technique on me. However, the information provided is too extensive and confusing, listing far too many ""points"" in the body with corresponding healing touches to keep track of them. The body map listing them is in the first part of the book, so you have to flip back and forth to see what the author is referring to. I also thought some of the miraculous healing claims a little outrageous. The way this system originated is also a little murky. This is a better book for people training to learn this practice than for the lay public."
4,well written,"This is a well written book about the ancient healing art Jin Shin Jyutsu that gives practical advice for everyday self-help healing.Alice Burmeister has a forward and easy-to-follow writing style that is enjoyable to read. The only draw back however is the fact that there are now colour photographs in this book, which are especially useful for JSJ beginners. For this I highly recommend the beautiful self-help JSJ booklet Wellness above the Clouds.[...]"
1,HANSON??! EEEEK!! YUCK!!! HELP!!!,"Okay, well I bought this video for one of my friends at christmas, and she MADE me watch it with her!!! It sucked!! I despised Hanson before, but damn! They were sure ugly! It is a waste of money, and doesn't really give any good information either, please don't waste your money on it!! If you want a GREAT video with FINE GUYS in it then get 'N THE MIX with 'N Sync! Great video, well done, and Justin and the others are fine! The hanson video is not worth your time, or money, even if you are a fan!!! Listen to me, or you'll regret it!! It didn't even deserve one star!"
5,a review from mexico,"this is the coolest video i ever see before even in you don't like hanson belive me you gonna love it you know there's alot of music, lights n hanson n hanson n hanson n hansoooooooon o by the way I LOVE ISAAC HANSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,HOT HOT HOT HOT,"Wow,although i did not get to see HANSON perform this video takes you everywhere with the three very cute guys.A must for all Hanson fans"
5,IT ROCKZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I went to the seattle concert and i didn't get good seats, well, they weren't so bad. I still don't have the video, but it was on t.v last week and i got the chance to see it and it's soooooooo cool, it's like if you were there.It rockz. I hope i get it soon 'coz it's not in mexico yet."
2,"Take ""Introduction To"" out of the title","This was my first course in stochastics and this book was horrible to start with. I learned all the material from other study guides which used easier examples and were written in english. If you're looking for an introduction to stochastics forget this book, if you've had some previous experience it will probably do quite well."
1,Disappointing Book!,"This is probably the worst textbook I have read in my life. Each chapter basically consists of numerous solved problems. There is almost no explanation of the basics of probability theory and how one should go about solving these problems. Needless to say, I had to concurrently read two other textbooks to understand the material. This is more of a book of problems than an introductory textbook."
1,Horrible.,"Outdated and horrible. I didn't like it at all, I'd give this away for free to someone I didn't like. The designs weren't good. Too much photoshop!"
5,A book every Politician should read,"Finally, a well researched book about the most fundamental roll in society, motherhood, and how our culture has short changed it. This book will open the eyes of both men and women to a problem too close for any of us to really see. For all the speeches about the importance of children and motherhood, this book gives every citizen the resource to see the issue clearer and follow through with governmental changes that will make a difference for our children and therefor our future. The empty rhetoric of ""family values"" is over. It is time to change our economic system to truly value the family. I recommend that everyone moved by this book buy an extra copy and send it to your local representative. I did."
2,Didn't tell me anything I didn't alreay know.,"I was hoping for more of a ""price"" mothers pay in terms of lost promotions, projects, opportunities, stature and the treatment they receive as a ""consequence"" of becoming a mother and needing a semblance of flexibility. I already know the monetary equivalent of what I do as a mother. It doesn't help me gain a new perspective or validate any of my own experiences as a mother with a full time career."
4,Worth the Read,This book offers a searing criticism of the ways that mothers pay a price in our society. I read this book for my own edification and loved her honesty. It's written in easy to read style.I also used excerpts of this book in one of my women's studies classes and the students enjoyed it. Many of the re-entry students actually told me that they either checked it out at the library or purchased the book.I perused the reviews and was amused at how some reviewers felt that this book was whiny. Why is it that when we disagree we have to say that she (usually a woman under attack!) is whining. Motherhood isn't all bread and roses and this book explains why.
1,Destroying our country in the name of motherhood?,"I was disturbed by this book, to put it mildly. I am a stay-at-home mom myself, and I was curious about the tenets of a book that appeared to be defending mothers. Instead, in the name of motherhood, the author attacks our wonderful Constitutional government by blatantly extolling and calling for greater Socialism in our country. Has our freedom become so cheap in the last 200 years that we would lose it, not to an outside enemy, but from within by our own countrymen? I recommend that anyone thinking of reading this anti-American propaganda think again."
4,Liquid Fence Deer Repellent,"I've used this product for a few years, along with Deer Scram (a granular product). I alternate usage so that the deer do not get used to either and I start using them at the very first sign of deer damage. This method works well for me in keeping the deer away.I've not had a rabbit problem and don't know how effective it is.The only drawback is that it washes off in a good rain, as does Deer Scram and any other product of this type."
2,Must reapply everyday for weeks,"I bought a large spray container of this product. The smell is god awful and it seems to be marginally effective at best. I am using it to attempt to get rabbits from killing my lawn.If liquid fence is not reapplied everyday after the sprinklers have diluted it the rabbits just come back.Let's put it this way, I've gone through a large container and I'm looking for something else."
2,limited effectiveness,Works best in spring and late fall. Quite ineffective in summer and requires frequent reapplication.
1,Promising-but didn't work!!,Well recommended-but the axis deer in Maui totally ignored 3 applications. Didn't even slow down their munching.
1,Don't Trust this Product!,"Bought this last year at Lowes to spray on newly planted trees being browsed by deer. Not only did the spray not keep the deer away, I think it might have actually had an adverse effect on my Royal Empress Tree saplings! They seemed to wither and die after I sprayed them. The spray did not bother my pear trees but it certainly didn't deter the deer either. They gnawed those practically to the ground. The spray smells terrible so if you do use it where gloves and a t-shirt you don't care about and make sure you are down wind!Save yourself some money and make your own spray using a couple of eggs and water (20% egg to 80% water ratio). Just make sure you take the membranes out of the eggs before you put them in the spray bottle so it doesn't get clogged. You can also add some cayenne pepper so if the deer do taste your plantings it will be a one time deal!! Cheap, effective, easy."
1,Does NOT repel rabbits,"I applied this liberally at the base of the perimeter fence around my backyard. Then within 30 minutes I witnessed a rabbit go right past the sprayed area and into my yard. He and his bunny girlfriend decided later to use my garden as their honeymoon abode, as I found 4 of their babies. What's worse is that this stuff stinks for DAYS after it has dried, making my family nauseous everytime they came near it. Now my backyard is ONLY enjoyed by the rabbits, because my family can't stand the smell. Either all the rabbits in my neighborhood have no olfactory senses or THIS STUFF DOESN'T WORK."
5,Gives us our yard back,Easy to mix with water in a sprayer. Make sure yours does not have a restriction as there will be some solid particles. Spray weekly at first to train your deer or bunnies from eating your plants and trees. After a month or so you can switch to every other week. Be for-warned this stuff smells bad when first applied. Stay up wind when you can. It does dissipate after 20 mins or so. It is so worth it to me for the ability to put in new trees or have some flowers in our wildlife back yard.
5,This Stuff Works and Works Well,"My neighborhood has had a rabbit infestation issue, and even with fences, the rabbits find new ways of getting in and eating the tasty flowers / bushes. This product solved it; plants are now growing and flowering again. My product contained 40oz versus the 32oz, as described and makes 5 gallons.Must be very careful making your mix -- don't spill anything, or you will be sorry. Don't make the mix inside your house. I use an old Windex sprayer for my mix. I can't stress this enough: THIS IS THE MOST VILE SMELLING CONCOCTION ON EARTH -- DON'T SPRAY INTO THE WIND. Smell disipates after a day or so -- keep windows closed until then."
5,WORKS WHERE NOTHING ELSE DOES,"DEER IN OUR AREA ARE MORE COMMON THAN DOGS. HAVE USED THIS FOR 3 YEARS NOW AND IN SHORT, THE STUFF WORKS!! JUST A NOTE THO- YOU NEED TO RE-APPLY AFTER A RAIN OR 10 OR SO DAYS HAVE PASSED. AS THE SUMMER GETS DRY AND THE BROWSE OR FOOD STARTS TO DIMINISH, THE DEER GET MORE AGRESSIVE IN THEIR SEARCH FOR FOOD SO YOU MUST RE-APPLY MORE OFTEN. I USED TO GET THE PRODUCT AT A NURSERY BUT IT WAS PRETTY $$ SO I ORDERED ONLINE AND THE CONCENTRATE IS REASONABLELY PRICED. GET ENOUGH TO LAST THE SEASON. THE PRODUCT IS EFFECTIVE."
3,It's a little fragile,"I get this because it goes with my On Guard lock. I get a couple of them because it tends to break -- sometimes totally, sometimes just a little plastic tab that keeps it from jumping out. Last time it broke I hit a pretty horrendous bump that I didn't see till the last minute (I hopped my front wheel over it, but not the rear) and the blasted lock fell off. I use velcro to secure it routinely, so the lock didn't hit the ground, just hung from the velcro. All in all I wish I could get one that was more heavy duty."
1,This thing broke in 6 weeks,Don't rely on this mount. It will break. The plastic that is supposed to hold the lock in place is too thin to support the weight of the lock for very long. This thing is a complete waste of money. They should have made it out of metal and charged $15 for it.
3,its not what I expected,"The picture is misleading, this mounting bracket is simply a rope attached to a plastic mountOf course it still works but its life is severely limited, I'd give it maybe 2 months max, I'll edit this review when it breaks...the reason I say its durability is limited is because I used the same rope attached to a plastic mount bracket before and they truly break easily..."
2,Cheap plastic,"Why can't they make this out of metal? The cheap plastic breaks off within a few months, which causes the lock to fall out on the street. I had to replace my Mini bulldog because it was dropped many times at fast speeds and eventually causes the lock to pop open (which makes me think you can crack the lock my a sledge hammer hitting the gray plastic in the middle of the lock)Anyway, I hope someone who has a CNC shop would be able to replicate this to be in full metal, I would buy it for $20 easily. Your better off putting your lock on your handlebars."
1,Terrible Design,Absolutely terrible design -- it's a cloth strap wrapped around your frame secured by a metal ratchet inside a plastic housing. Does not remain tight!
1,Piece of junk,"I bought the On-Guard Bull Dog lock and this mount came with it. The lock is well made and works flawlessly. However, the mount is junk. The part that takes the majority of wear is plastic and does not hold up. When my first one became unusable, I called the company and they sent me a new one. The second one did not last either. I asked the owner of my bike shop if I had it mounted correctly and he said that I did. Hope this review helps!"
2,not the same as the photo,"Item I received was not the same as the photo. I expected a older model, but the product I received was a newer design. Although it came with an adapter, the adapter was too small for my onGaurd bike lock."
1,Came free with my lock and I paid what it was worth,"After only 20 miles or so worth of use the metal screw stripped out of the plastic piece sending my heavy duty U-bolt lock bouncing through traffic. Thank god it didn't smash into someone's car or I'm sure I'd have to pay for it. Don't buy this by itself, and if it comes with your lock buy a replacement ASAP"
3,Encylopedic but dry,"This dull but fact-filled book lists hundreds of Koranic verses which parallel either sections of the Hebrew Bible or Midrashic legends, thus showing that the author of the Koran was aware of a great deal of rabbinic lore (something that is no surprise to pious Muslims!)"
4,the product this according to the awaited thing,the product this according to the waited for thing and is very satisfactory to receive what one sees in the photographies
4,Great advice & humor for any young athlete or parents,"You do not need to be a Pittsburgh Penguin Fan to enjoy this book.While Dan is now the Pittsburgh Coach,this is how to strive to always try to do your best !It is Easy Reading for the kids as well as the parents and coaches for ANY sport."
4,Fascinating compositions,"Roberto is a very creative musician, not necessarily charismatic, yet very versatile in his command of the piano. The personnel on this record is outstanding, the sound is clean and crisp. The cover art made me think that this was a wild improvisational collection of music, the opposite is true. Annet Marina, for example, starts off slow, light and airy with some female vocals thrown in for good measure, then gets a tad more heavy with drums and keyboard for about 30 seconds until it ends almost as light as it started. The other songs are similarly easily digestible with occasional guitar, a good dose of drums and percussion, some guitar and sax. Variety is the key here. I would have given it a five if we heard more from Roberto himself."
4,Extensive,"Clear, very thorough explanations of how each of the body systems work & how they interact. Good suggestions for improving your body's efficiency. No hype, no sales pitch, just information."
1,What the......?,"Why do both of these reviewers say they can't wait for ""Devil Within 2""? Sounds very fishy to me. Even if they liked it (which I find hard to believe), it's almost like they know what's coming and want to promote it. Hmmmm....sounds like they might have been involved in this flick from the start. Beware!!!"
1,Total rubbish,"This film really is rubbish, its dull, the acting is awful and the ""Suprise"" at the end isnt a suprise because u must be stupid if you dont see it coming.I agree with the person who said the 5* reviews sound dodgy, they defo had something to do with the movie."
5,FABULOUS,"WE LOVED THIS MOVIE, A GREAT THRILLER WITH A SURPRISING ENDING. HAD MANY FRIENDS OVER AND THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT ALSO! WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO DEVIL WITHIN II."
3,J am not satisfied,"First j whant to tell you, that this has not wery good approach to reader. You start to thinking that you read a some kind of literarily work, not instructions. Hole book is like one big text.The pictures in it are black&white; (poore quality), wich is inadmissible. Also, the text is not simple. If you whant to get some use of this book, you will need to read it several times with exertion.J am not saying that this book has no worthiness, just j whant to tell you that the way of exposition autors knowledge is very bad."
3,Interesting perspective,"This book was written at the historical turn from Impressionism to Expressionism. Speed's opinions about the transition are often indignant, yet poignant, and are a very interesting and informative example of the shock and opposition to the birth of pure abstraction. Once past that, he launches into a primer on oil painting as it was taught in his time. Even though I have been painting for years, I found in his writing a fresh take on what some would consider to be outdated instruction. A major drawback to this edition is the horrible reproduction of the images from the original text. Speed relies heavily on them and they are impossible to look at. Since they are mostly instructional demonstrations created by Speed, they cannot be accessed online as one can do with the classic works he references. His writing will be the only thing you will take away from this text, but is is still worth a studied read."
4,Unusual ArtText,"Art instruction of this nature are hard to come by. This book should be entirely redone - different format, larger illustrations in color, a little updating - not too much. Speed is so interesting and helpful. He organizes what you already know, introduces you approaches you never thought of, shares his artistic philosophy and generally fills in the gaps in one's education. Glad I bought it."
1,throw this book away,"Utterly useless book. Aside from being difficult to follow, the author gives a narrow view of painting methods that focuses on a strangely configured method of direct painting. He even goes so far as to give some dangerous advice; like allowing your recently worked on oil paintings to dry in front of the fire or in direct sunlight! Both are extremely hazardous to the drying paint film-DONT DO THAT.I was looking for some inside types on Venetian, Flemish or French Academic style painting technique, but found some strange, obscure English method of painting. It doesn't read so much as a concise manual but a long, wandering, incoherent philosophy of painting. It is purely decorative writing by an artist that never really seemed to produce anything of any interest. This book belongs with the authors book on drawing, in the garbage. You are better off reading Cennino Cennini, Vasari or Da Vinci.CCJ"
5,A Must Read Book for the Serious Artist,"As a professional artist I have been a long time admirer of Harold Speed's books. If you are interested in learning the craft of painting the human figure in oil, then there is really no better primer than Oil Painting Techniques by Harold Speed. From my own experience in painting I have come to find that Speed's approach is the most intelligent and manageable of any I've studied. It's a method that applies to any subject, not just figure painting. No cheap gimmicks or ""tricks,"" just good common sense and a clear explanation how to break down the spectrum of visual data into the most important components."
5,This is a book that should become your Bible of painting.,This book you shall refer to over and over again learning newer and newer concepts and ideals you would have thought you had already learned. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THE SERIOUS AND TRUE STUDENT OF PAINTING.
2,Not as good as in the past,The product is much thinner ie watery than the product that I had been using for the past twelve years however that came in the glass container with the accompanying aftershave and I used safari as my aftershave lotion of choice. Sadly I may have to look elsewhere for a creamier balm. Also the shipping adds a fair amount to the overall purchase as there are no outlets in Australia for safari
5,Uplifting and Inspirational,"If you're a fan of Warren, then you owe it to yourself to pick this up. It's a very emotional and inspiring piece that shows you how much character that Warren had. I don't know anyone who could have handled such grim circumstances with such grace. I'd even go so far as to reccommend this to non-fans as well. Like it says on the back of the case, ""Watch it with someone you care about"". This, much like ""The Wind"" will never leave my collection."
2,G4 - Gibb 4 Gotten!,"I don't know what G4 stands for, but there are some nasty guesses. They are not the problem. Robin Gibb singing a Barry Gibb song is so strange; I don't know what to make of it! Forget the song - it's mediocre here. The videos are simply stoic as well. The best thing about this single is the cover of ""Don't Dream Its Over"", which sounds like some serious effort was put into it. That alone is worth the single and you are hearing this from a HUGE Bee Gees fan."
4,Capable System Suite,"Initially when I was looking for something to protect my computer, I looked at the big names like McAfee and Symantec, but after pricing out what they were offering compared to Ontrack, Ontrack was by far the cheapest, and easiest to install and use. I like the full blown suite, rather than the piece meal approach. I have pretty much used everything (personal firewall, disk defrag, recovery disk), and I like the one-click features (well almost one-click). The only thing I find annoying is the fact that you have to click through (about 4 or 5 clicks -- means you cannot leave it unattended) the updates. I wish it could also be one click.If you are looking for a set of utilities to use for your personal computer, I would recommend looking into this package as well."
4,Very Good Software,This software is very easy and helpful to use. The price is also a good deal taking in consideration all the applications included. I recommend it.
1,"Not ""Upgrade to XP"" Compatible","I recently upgraded from Windows ME to XP and re-installed System Suite v 4.0.30.13. When I went to the ""uninstall"" feature it took about 45 minutes for the the scan to find one item and that was another program I had reinstalled successfully after the upgrade to XP. After searching FAQ'a on V-Com.COM I contacted tech support. Here is their response:""Response (V Communications Technical Support) - 02/10/2003 05:12 PMHello,This is correct. Only programs that were installed by the current operating system will be recognized. Also any programs that are installed with the Windows Installer tool itself will not be available for removal by the Uninstall tool in SystemSuite."""
3,Support NOW Nonexistent,"Liked software until recently. Discovered problem w/NetDefense blocking critical server update connection(after hours of working on problem w/other software vendor system support)Disabling NetDefense does NOT DISABLE NETDEFENSE. Only unstalling the entire SS4 allows server connection/updates. v-Com support nonexistent. OnTrack(former developer/retailer purchased by V-Com) was good support; ""v-com"" absolutely terrible. Contact capability intentionally made difficult. All either computer responses/worthless and all problems considered solved unless you contact w/i 48 hours. Contact practically impossible. OnTrack no longer allowed to provide tech support, although I did receive a response f/ OnTrack, they can no longer assist buyers. With NO TECH SUPPORT, software will normally become virtually worthless. Switching to other utilities."
1,Don't buy it,"I am a user of previous versions of System Suite. Everything was fine in Windows 98. On Track has been bought out by VCom. Version 4.0 has many bugs. There is no support and the application has beeen nothing but trouble (Windows XP). It reported I had a virus PE_ELKERN.D I ran a complete virus scan 5 times, 6 hours, and it said it was cleaned. However, System suites virus message kept popping up, hundreds of them, almost every key stroke. I ran Norton Virus Scan- no infected files, I also ran McAfee, no infected files. I tried to look up the virus (vil.nai.com) and there is no record of it. System Suite completly hosed up my system. I finally had to use Win XP to uninstall it."
3,Disappointing!,"I played this recently and decided that it must have been back in the days when I bought things solely on name recognition.Other recordings I have of Joe Pass were when he played in groups backing Ella Fitzgerald or with Milt Jackson or Oscar Peterson. I had the highest respect for him, considering him, arguably, as the most technically proficient guitarist I've ever heard.......not my most favorite....but he could sure play!This cd fell short because of my personal expectations. This sounds like a combination of my definition of smooth jazz and Brazilian pop(not my bag). The only cuts I could like are ""Estate"" and possibly ""I Can't Help It"".Buyer Beware! This may not be what you are looking for when you think of Joe Pass, a truly great jazz guitarist."
4,Surprisingly Good Start,"I bought this book without high expectations. I had heard very bad things about the series but was pleasantly surprised by this decent first collection. It reveals a little about the new Batgirl's past and a bit about her current relationship with Batman through conflicts with various antagonists.She is an interesting character, but I fear that developments towards the end of this series is going to change that. Batgirl was a mute because her father never taught her to speak, instead concentrating all her training on combat and related skills. In his collection she meets someone who helps her to understand words. This may ruin things in the future. Instead of letter her learn to speak over a period of time, the writers are going for a shortcut. Its much more difficult to write characters who don't speak but this is part of what makes her interesting."
2,Overly cartoony art and subpar plot!,"Cassandra Cain, who was introduced during ""No Man's Land"", is an interesting idea for a character. Here, in her solo series, she is so limited by her lack of speech that you have nearly no feelings for the character. Then, when her situation changes it seems so random and strangely timed its weird. The art is really not a good fit for the book. Certain scenes would look much more meaningful if the art was more straight forward. Overall, not much happened. This was a very lackluster beginning to a series!"
1,NOT the Best Collection!,"A ""Best Collection"" this certainly isn't! Yet again, the appalling Picks have managed to worm their way into some Buddy Holly tracks on which they were never intended to feature. As if that weren't bad enough, this was quite a pricey CD.In my opinion, it's about time this sort of ""deception by omission"" - IE incomplete / inadequate / misleading product description - was outlawed.For the information of real Holly fans, the reference code for this CD is TECX-20944 / 21820 & the CD insert carries the line ""OVERSEAS MONO / STEREO"" at the top.Avoid at all costs!"
5,Fantastic Music,I loved this Christmas CD. It is joyful and upbeat and shares the true meaning of Christmas.
5,Incredilbe!,I bought this for a gift. I already have a copy for several years and it is very special and Sarah is magnificent as well as the whole score of the music.
2,Intrinsic Bias,"The title of this book alone should warn you about it's slant. Why is Michael's appearance of any import? Do we hate fat people so much, or is it that, today, nothing could be more hurtful than to call someone fat? You can lie to the world, engage the planet in a self-serving war, manipulate nations, but heaven forbid if you should write about it. David and Jason should have better things to do."
1,Bad book,"Fortunately I did not buy it. This is pure junk. I decided to see what it was all about and it seems to be written by a ten year old. I would not have written a bad review only I just found out that the freak who wrote this book is trying to get democrats to vote republican in order to get the guy who is sure to win as the republican front runner. I am from a country that bullies and cheats. This is down on the same level as any backward country. Its dishonest and un American. Since this jerk is the kind of guy who goes around using his fame to spread propaganda and to influence people to do dishonest things I am going to say that I can see why this book looks like it was written by a child. Sadly, people give this loser credibility. In another time this man would have been disrespected for having no class instead of giving him audience."
1,a book that demonstrates Michael Moore's dishonesty,"This book demonstrates that Michael Moore's filmmaking is dishonest, that he distorts the truth in order to attack people whose political ideologies differ from his. I hope that people will read this book carefully and share it--or recommend it--to others so that people can see how Moore manipulates the truth. The book is very convincing and has more truth in it than a Michael Moore ""documentary."""
3,Hypocrites criticising a hypocrite...,"I picked up this book from a stand in my local store, and browsed the first couple of chapters to kill some time. It seemed clear, quite concise and to the point (though I don't know if the rest is more of the same.) But in the middle of criticising Moore for misquoting and hypocrasy, the authors misquote, and hence are hypocrites. ""The greater the lie, the greater the chance of it being believed"" are in fact the words of Joseph Goebbels, not Adolf Hitler. Small compared to Moore's mistakes, but still shoddy."
1,total crap,"dosent even deserve one star.while on the surface this book looks like its agenda is purely anti-moore, but it is easy to see its true message:hail to the dummy!"
2,Annoying,"This I can assure you is the most unbiased review of the book for I am neither a fan of Moore's or of the author's of this book. I don't claim to belong to any specific political party. I vote for the person who believes in the same things as I do, regardless of party affiliation.Clarke and Hardy are just as guilty as Moore could ever be. Slander is never an attractive quality, it just helps that Moore is physically unattractive as well. Remember that behind every lie is a truth, and every truth a lie.Like Moore's work, you should take this book with a grain of salt"
2,Pillock talk ......,"I was shocked but not overly surprised by this nasty little book, which amounts to little more than name-calling and going ""nyah, nyah"" at Michael Moore, who at the very least has credentials as a writer/film-maker, which is more than I can say for the obtuse duo of Hardy and Clarke, two pillocks who probably worship at the temple of Rush Limbaugh.What these two chappies need to learn is tact."
1,Gibberish,"Possibly the worst-written, most repetitive book I've had the displeasure to read. Was it really too much trouble for the ""authors"" to bother taking a writing class?On the plus side, the pages turned out to be fairly absorbent...so it has that going for it."
1,Whatever....You can't touch Mike,"Michael Moore has won both an Oscar and the top prize for Cannes Film Festival. He also has written several books that have made it to the #1 New York Times best sellers list. Any one of these accomplishments would be a life time achievement for a person. But Michael Moore has achieved all three - a massive feat by any standards. Messers Hardy and Jason's book is akin to lousy ants bad mouthing the mighty elephant. In their combined lifespans, I doubt they'll achieve even half of what Mr. Moore has already accomplished. In conclusion, their book will sell a few copies and be forgotten by fall; but for the next 20 years, Michael Moore's 'Fahrenheit 9/11' will be discussed in pundit circles as the only documentary to beat all other Hollywood offerings and premiere as the #1 film in America."
1,"Oh, what's the point?","Man, people just can't stand it when somebody stands for something they don't believe in. Moore is a breath of fresh air in an era of insanity, and this is the BEST his opponents can come up with?Sad."
1,One word HORRIBLE,this is the worst book ever written worse than the worst book you had to read in high school Terrible One star is too high a rating for this book!!! read the real version Stupid White Men by Micheal Moore it is good and see Fareignheit 9/11 its the best documentary ever made!!!!!!
1,Author David T. Hardy is an attorney for the NRA,"Co-written by NRA lawyer David T. Hardy, (who challenged the 1994 federal law banning assault weapons, arguing that it denied NRA members equal protection under the law), this book is sure to delight Michael Savage, Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity fans everywhere!"
1,Hypocrisy? ...You could say that..,"Sometimes you have to wonder how stupid writers must believe readers to be; this is one of those occasions. The premise for the book is simply to do a 'Michael Moore' styled expose on the man himself but they unsurprisingly become the victims of their own arguments. Moore makes money from his books/films, they argue? I would love to believe that the writers of this book donate their earnings to charity (Victims in Iraq perhaps?) but, alas, that seems a bit too far fetched. The reason that Moore's work is successful is that he highlights the immoral and decitfull activities that blight orgnisations and Governments that care very little for the people they serve. Should I be struck into a blind rage that the man who does this earns some substantial money for doing so?? give the guy a raise, I say..."
1,people are stupid....,"Michael Moore is a genious, people who oppose this book are just affraid to accept the truth!!! That about sums it up."
1,A shame I can't give it zero stars.,"Michael Moore is a waste of space. He isn't the Left's Rush Limbaugh, he's the Left's David Koresh. He has countless apathetic, uninformed political know-nothings drinking the Kool-Aid and loving every drop.Bless Hardy & Clarke for writing this book. It is a must read for anyone who wishes to be...informed. Of course, those who need it the most - the Mooreons - won't go near it. It doesn't have nearly enough baseless lies for their liking I guess.Write a sequel, PLEASE!!! Call it ""Celsius 11/2"" and let it chronicle the re-election of George W. Bush and the resulting sadness of Mr. Fahrenheit himself. He's nothing but a Big Fat Stupid White Man!"
1,"Terrible book, very inaccurate","I bought this book to get both sides of the story after seeing Moore's movie fahrenheit 911. I thought Hardy's book was dull, uninformative and worst of all: completely inaccurate."
1,Good to see the Bushies are Scared of Michael Moore,This book would not exist if the Bush fanatics were not deathly frightend of Michael Moore and his documentary.They deserve more to be afraid of defending Bushes record. Perhaps attacking Michael Moore is another attempt at avoiding that discussion.
1,Not Original,"I wish that this author could be a little more original. The spoofing of Moore (and Franken's) title, and the copying of the cover art work, means this work has minimzed itself.Moore's popularity is largely because of the originality of his approach. Copying that in this book (and the upcoming MM documentary) makes these works seem petty. IF you want to present grand, broad ideas, don't limit yourself to spoofing someone to do it. Very disappointing."
5,Excellent exposé,"I enjoyed watching Moore's film Roger and Me, and I do appreciate his style of film making. He is funny and ironic, it's no wonder people like his movies, and I can understand why the Left really like him. Problem is, he's a liar plain and simple. He appeals only to the lowest common demomenator with his self-serving, egotistical films which contribute very little to actual debate. Ultimately, as this book illustrates, is that Moore is totally incapable of providing real discourse and must manufactor his evidence faster than a Lockheed plant builds a WMD...oops, sorry, I mean satellite. Moore's deceptions have finally seen the light of day, and I think this book does a great job of bringing them forward. Read this book, and watch his movies (objectively on both counts) and then decide for yourself which provides the more compelling argument."
3,As good a book as any of Michael Moores,"This book is as believable as any that Michael himself has written. The reactions and reviews I've read have made me laugh and have confirmed for me what I believe to be one of the problems many people face. Many people, many that I know, who have become rabid fans of Michael Moore or Rush Limbaugh for that matter, have forgotten that these men are entertainers whose agenda is to make money by entertaining people.Please take off your blinders and view the world with open, inquisitive eyes. Don't believe anything you read without doing your own homework. Every news agency has some political alignment and the facts that they present are slanted to sway your opinions. The days of unbiased reporting (assuming that at one time we did have unbiased reporting) are long gone. Trust no one.D. McDougal"
4,Exposes Moore for the fraud he is....,"It's clear that some of the detractors of this book haven't read it.While there are a couple of editing errors that distract the reader, I found nothing unfactual about the book. Opinions were clearly labeled as opinions.Moore clearly is not a truthful documentarian. He makes ""crockumentaries"" which are more suited to the Goebbels-Riefenstahl school of propaganda film production. The fact that he is given credibility is sickening. God help our country."
5,In Wonderment..........,"At last, I can now see just how m. moore does it, how he lies, how he is able to dupe the gullible population, but also just how twisted a mind he actually has.This book carefully lists lie after lie, and how by patient clipping moore played into the hands of the hate-America in Roger and Me, Columbine, and now Fahrenheit.So, all you new authors: Go off your meds, and make a fortune doing what moore does best: lie!."
3,It's Interesting. . .,"that nearly all of the one-star reviews offer up questionable logic (if any) supported with grammar and paragraphs (if any) that wouldn't sway many undecided readers.The four- and five-star people seem to be able to write.Like it or not, you (and your opinions) are given the consideration that their presentation deserves.Moore and his supporters deserve each other."
3,"Good, but not Great","While the subject and main premise of this book are good, the overall layout and editing is quite bad. The same examples of Moore are repeated numerous times and the articles written by outside writers are repetitious. The book does provide a good analysis of Moore, but the writers should have shortened this book by about 100 pages and not inserted the numerous outside articles. If you don't like Moore and want to know more about him, this is a great book to read. Otherwise, it is not worth wasting your money on."
5,Great Book!! Eye opener,"So everyone who doesn't agree (or like) this book must be the stupid people that Moore talks so much about. It is a shame that so many intelligent American's will hook on to whatever is popular at the time and forget about the values of America. I found this book is a great book. It challenges the thoughts and theories of this idiot. It is a real is an eye opener. I guess he is the ""American Dream"". He was a loser who can't even hold a steady job until the ""stupid Americans"" who hold on to his every word idolize him. Guess he better thank the God he so much hates for the ""stupid Americans"" or he would really be a loser with no money."
5,Moore ons !!!,Excellent book !!!!!...Moore is a goofy grossly obese dolt with with no integrity...NONE !!..I shall definately spread the word of this book. THANX !!!!Moore is still retarded !!!
1,Will Bush reject votes from the fat and ugly? I hope he does,"One of the admirers of this book quotes Hitler to convey his pleasure. Thats cool. I hope all of you guys who love this book do the same, thus revealing the true nature of republicanism in US."
1,What's the American Right afraid of?,"This book does not fill any purpose. If we are not supposed to listen to a stupid white man, then the GOP is in trouble! The authors try too debunk Michael Moore by writing in his style. Yes, very funny. Ha Ha. The authors claim that Moore lies. If he lies why don't they sue him? Don't write a book that no one will read. Obviously Moore does hit a sore spot, because otherwise the Right would not go to such great length too wilify him.Moore gives a voice to people that otherwise would not be heard. Messers. Hardy and Clarke just add to the right-wing cacaphony."
1,Author Needs Emotional Intelligence,Points are better made when the emotion involved doesn't leave such a nasty wake. Makes it hard for others to listen to. I think the author might want to scroll on over and by The Emotional Intelligence Quickbook to read before writing his next book.
1,michael moore IS just,"All of Michael Moore's works are meant to raise awareness about the many faults of our government. Even though some of what he says are falsitys, ITS THE SAME THING WITH BUSH! Do you really think that the government is telling you the honest truth??? Of course not. They try to alter your opinian by only sharing certain info to the media. That is why we NEED people like Michael Moore! Watch his new movie. F9/11 is a great work of art that deserves all of it's credit.MICHAEL MOORE KICKS ASS!CONSERVATIVES SUCK!!!"
1,Ashamed Of The Democratic Party,"Up until the last election I was a Democrat. After reading the lies in Michael Moore's book I will never vote for a democratic candidate again. His book is full of lies. If a person reads this book and can on their own see the lies, they are hopeless and will continue to be the type of person who does not take responsibility for their own welfare. SHAME ON YOU MR. MOORE,SHAME ON YOU. Does this sound familiar."
1,Consider the source,"David Hardy's motives are clear. He's a shill for the gun lobby. Heck, NRA Executive VP Wayne LaPierre was the best man at his wedding. The simple fact is if W loses, America might actually adopt some sane gun laws that will prevent tragedies like three Alabama police officers being gunned down in June by one assault weapon-wielding assailant. Hardy and his ilk will do anything to maintain access to any and all weaponry for himself and his insecure buddies. The NRA lies on a regular basis, so why should anyone be surprised when its minions do the same? Save your money and get the facts on Hardy at Buzzflash.com."
1,This book is a complete waste of money...,"Becaue the book is LITERALLY culled from numerous anti-Moore websites, which you can presumably access if you're reading this. For FREE. Why anyone should give their hard-earned money to two ""journalists"" who are simply plagarizing the Web is beyond me.So if you feel like being ripped off, buy this book."
1,The Inevitable,"I imagine a book like this is inevitable. While Moore is providing first order critique and context for the America I live in--and yes, making some money off of his chosen profession--it doesn't surprise me that Clarke and Hardy have seen fit to belly up at the trough of second level critique and attempt to knock down Moore. Instead of focusing on pertinent issues or the lies of the stupid white men that happen to be sleeping in the white house, this book attempts to shift our focus away from the task of evaluating the current 'leader of the free world' in the coming election. Similar to Mr. Moore's probable reaction, I will respectfully shrug my shoulders and summarize my reaction to this written work in one carefully chosen syllable, ""eh?"""
1,Oxymoron? No just 2 conservative morons,"Too bad Michael Moore wrote it first! Not to mention that it took the brain power of 2 people to come up with this poor attempt of humor and cheap shots. Just another example of vision-(less) NON!-creative conservatives capitalizing off of the working mans talents.Oh, also, did somebody tell these guys and their publishers that Al Franken also wrote it first. Obviously NOT.2 to 1, you lose(rs)."
1,"Deceitful, full of lies.","This books claims to bring to light lies told by Michael Moore, it claims to reveal the truth and to use nothing but fact to prove Moore a liar and distributor of propaganda. But, just like the many works, websites and individuals that make these claims ( myself among them at one time) they fail miserably to make a dent in his arguments. Moore's editing is slightly manipulative, I have checked that myself, but the way this book alters quotes and statistics is insane. Michael Moore may be a deceiver, I dont know if he is, but trying to discredit him by lying even more is despicable. Hate-monging propaganda at its best."
1,Socialist Mr. Moore,"Perhaps the slovenly, obese socialist Mikey Moore would do better to leave the USA he despises so much."
1,Two Moore jumping on the bandwagon,"David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke are just two hacks trying desparately make money off Michael Moore's name. Amazon is even selling more than 60 used versions of this book, which is a statement of its poor writing."
1,"Quit lying to yourselves, righties!","You're going down on a sinking ship.This book accuses Mike of stretching facts, but WOAH NELLY! It all but says that Moore is responsibile for 9/11. The writing is horrible, and I'm pretty sure their fact checking on more consisted of spending three hours on Google. Every word on every page is harsh bias, and there are many outright falsehoods in this book.But pick it up from your library and have a good laugh. The right is scared to death, and this is how they react."
1,Pathetic,"The only thing more pathetic than this poorly written and poorly documented piece of junk are the poor saps who give it a high rating. Most of the ""facts"" presented are things either made up or heard second-hand (or third-hand)from right-wing talk shows. After reading some of the hilariously bad ""reviews"" (I especially love the poor fellow who mis-spelled ""Traitorous""Ever used a dictionary pal?)it's easy to see how the Nazis found their followers. God help us."
1,Hmmmmm no tthe best read.,I'm neutral with Michael Moore. I dont agree with some things he says but I do with other things. After reading this book I could not beleive how arogant some people can be. Meaning the author of this book. Really more of a pointless book I would never waste money on a pointless book like this one ever again.
5,Liberals love to hate,"i discovered something fascinating. most everyone who rates this book a 1 is a heavy metal loving, artsy type athiest. you can tell this by checking out their other reviews and their wish lists. what do you guys think about that?"
2,Hardy and Clarke are no better than Moore himself,"Would-be character assasins David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke rake the muck on Michael Moore in their new book. However, they share Moore's knack for blowing minor issues out of proportion. The book seems to imply that the trivial inaccuracies they have dug up from Moore's work render him incapable of ever telling the truth. One of the examples they cite is that Moore was not actually born in Flint, but rather one of Flint's ""wealthy"" suburbs. Moore has certainly exaggerated and lied on occasion, but by no means does that mean his works don't contain valid points. Intellgent readers should read this with caution, as they would read a book by, say, Michael Moore. Intelligent people in general should also stock up on earplugs, since right-wingers everywhere will doubtlessly use this book as an excuse to blather on about the ""lies"" of the ""liberal"" media. It isn't."
1,Typical right wing personal attack machine,"This book is typical of ALL right-wing, conservative, nuts who can't attack the FACTS, because they're always on the side of LIBERALS! So, instead, they just attack the person stating the facts. There isn't one piece of important factual information in this entire book. Do youself a favor - skip it."
1,Wow...how petty,"It's amazing what some people will write and publish when they don't like a person. If the main stream press would put as much effort into unveiling the lies of President Bush as these authors put into slimming michael moore, we'd probably be watching an impeachment right now."
2,Unintentionally...,"...the authors made me like Michael Moore. I think they tripped over themselves making him look bad, but really they made him look like an average American who happens to be a documentarian."
1,The GOP are desperate,"When the GOP gets the first scent of failure, they lie about the people who are coming into power. Since Michael Moore is kicking them while they are down, they feel the need to put out a book on him that says nothing and proves nothing. Well, guess what, Bush is going to lose and for the first time in 4 years we will have a president who was actually elected. And this Michael Moore book isn't going to change that."
1,Conservatives can't stand Moores use of their tactics.,"The title of this review just about says it all. Moore at least doesn't hide out behind the guise of 'fairness', 'balance', or 'news' Moore does what Coulter, Hannity, and O'Reiley do, and the Liberals can get over that one too. However, what is really sad is that Moore has to do what they do in order to be heard. This book? Just another pathetic attempt to sink us further down into the gutter. Like it? Nope! I recomend reading something else and not waisting the time on this book."
2,Fighting fire with fire,"It's a rare case of tables turned for the conservatives and republicans. Whereas the televised spin of the administration always drowns out the collective voices of all those opposed, now it's time for the republicans to be drowned out.It is presumable that a greater number will see Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 film than read this book, so whether or not Mr Hardy can poke holes in Moore's film, his influence will be much lesser than Moore's. This book provides interesting counterpoints and rebuttals, and makes for an intriguing read, even for Moore fans. But don't expect it to soften Moore's blow on any larger a scale."
3,I totally still dont get it.,"Is this about what he says or is it about the fact that he said it? If it were a Skinny black woman, would the book have been written? Frankly, this whole concept would have been washed aside to begin with. Using his station as a dominant person in this society, he is saying stuff that many never heard said outside their homes.Weather or not you want to write a political stance on a store web site and think it will have much impact, then Um, keep typing. Me, I explore everything I can, figures how it applies to me, and then make a decision. Weather I agree with the opinion or not.To say he doesn't have anything vital to say is stupid. To say all he says is right is stupid. To take personal offense at a person to buck the system is stupid.Do you hate his opinions or do you hate the man? Make that clear and you will have a stronger argument.I want to know this side. But so far those being its ""grass roots"" reps. are not doing such a sound job."
1,"just the facts, ma'am","You just KNOW Moore is on to something when attack dogs like Laurel & Hardy (um, I mean Clarke & Hardy) are unleashed. As a propagandist, Moore is successful in moving people to laughter & to tears, AND in making money. Similarly, the Bush Administration's propaganda was successful in gaining America's support for an unnecessary war (but not in gaining support from the people of any other nation on earth except Kuwait) AND in making money for large corporations. However, unlike the Bush Administration, Moore's polemics are largely grounded in verifiable facts, and he doesn't send poor people off to get killed to further the interests of big business. Though sometimes funny, Clarke & Hardy are simply 2 more Orwellian mouthpieces for the Bush's self-described ""base"" - rich people & corporate fat cats. My recommendation: take this book to the bathroom, tear out the pages, & put them to their optimum use."
1,(...),"I would give this book 0 stars but it wasn't an option on the drop-down list.One of the authors (I'm not sure which one) of this book works for the NRA, so you know why this book was written.Republicans can't even come up with their own, original title for a book--they had to copy Al Franken and Michael Moore.What's next, a documentary film from the neocons called ""Roger and Me Bowl for Columbine on Fahrenheit 9/11?""Republicans can't even come up with one lie from Michael Moore; all they know how to do is attack people's character and looks.This book is shameless!"
1,Give me a Break,"One thing that continually irks me is peoples attacks on ""Michael Moore"" the person. They try and attack him on where he lives, what he looks like and of course the views he holds. Why would you speak ill upon the person. Argue the adverse of his points. Find the views he believes in and defend reasoning on the argument opposing him. The problem is, can't really do that since he actually defends his points. Hmm.. well, at least he's an easy target to attack, so even if he's saying the truth, it doesnt really matter - It's Michael Moore, noones going to listen unless their a stupid liberal, right? Give me a break."
1,Was this written by a third grader?,"A great topic idea but I am afraid the rush to get this book to press is what killed it, it is very very poorly written. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,"Too big of a title, few facts and figures!","I, also,was very curious to read what a high profile US lawyer could say about an austere type of guy, with an elementary education like Michael Moore. Well; I want my money back! I have a Latin American herritage and lived in Canada for 9 years. Therefore, I care less about our next door neighbours,my vote would not make a difference, but I have to admit that the entire world have seen Moore's documentaries and we all agree with the Columbine and 9/11 inside story. On this book, a so-called writter uses someone else's name to publish his own ideas and comments. And, he has copied political thoughts taken by some of his own clients! Talk about ""Ethics""!"
1,Where is America?,"What is extremely depressing to me about all of these books, whether they are ""right wing conspiracy"" or ""liberal fanatic,"" is the fact that with every new book and challenge book comes an even larger rift in America. Not only are we splitting ourselves into two different factions and losing all unity as a country, we are doing it by calling each other names we learned in third grade. Why? Why have we lost the resources to debate intelligently? Why must we lower ourselves to this 'he said, she said"" level? When did America become a culture who raises stupidity and name-calling to an amazing height, and condemns thoughtfulness, caring, and basic grammar as worthless? And why do we buy books like this?"
1,Sour grapes from the Neocons,"This book is another feeble Republican attempt to counter the books and movies coming out now that expose the lies and manipulations served up by the right. The problem is, when the facts aren't on your side, you produce a hack job rather than an interesting and important book.The book's approach is to kill the messenger, but the resulting impression is still the same: Americans were sold a terrible economy and a bogus war by the use of lies and scare tactics, and the same people who sold us the bad economy and the war by lying are getting rich from it. The Republican party and the Bush administration care about the average American only to the extent that he can keep them in power, die for their agenda, and get fleeced to line their pockets. If you want to know where these authors are coming from, see ""Outfoxed"". It will give you an idea of the journalistic standards they employ."
1,"Bad Grammer, No references","When reading these types of books, I love to go to the references and fish out the excerpts and piece together the `real' story.This book....This no references, it just states ""the facts"" without any proof.No trying to insult anyone, but this book caters to those who believe, ""Well, if it's printed... it must be true"" or something along those lines.The grammar- is horrible.... Like a Junior High student.... Really... Blech!!!All in all, the book is either a panick response to Michael Moore or just a cheap attempt to make a quick buck riding on Michael Moore's coat tails.If there was ever a book that needs to be ignored because of lack of professionalism, (meaning I want a good product for my money), this is it.If this was any other product, I would be able to return it to whomever for shoddy workmanship."
1,Wow. Insecurity is an ugly thing.,"I'm a staunch republican and can't believe the petulant tone this book takes on. It reads like the last cries of a child being dragged away from the sandbox. I don't like Michael Moore either, but at least I've read his books and seen his movies-- unlike the authors of this whining liturgy of tripe."
2,Not worth buying,"I am no fan of Michael Moore, though I am somewhat of a liberal and so I do like my books well written and well reasoned. This book is neither of those. While I do understand that many of Michael Moore's own works are often accused of being slanted and ill-researched (and this is likely true), I do not believe that that is a reason to answer in kind. Although the title of this book is a take-off from Al Franken, the book itself is nowhere near as clever as Franken's work. Save your money for that gun you've had your eye on.Jeremy W. Forstadt"
3,Crazy Americans,"I think that Americans shouldn't care who is Repiblican and who is conservative. Just try and choose the best person who can get the job done. Having seen Michael Moore's documentary - I assumed that some of the facts were true and the others were a little out of wack - you always should take everything with a grain of salt. All these people who are now just criticizing this book are just doing to these guys what they say these guys are doing to Michael Moore, who in turn is doing to George Bush.Half of them are probably just jealous they didn't write a book like this quick enough.Anyway - I hope that Americans can look outside the realms of 2 financially massive, huge political juggernauts that are the C's and R's. God Bless America.I'm a non-American"
3,Just like F9/11,"This book won't change anybody's minds, nor does it want to. If you didn't like moore beforehand, you'll find plenty of well-documented reasons to back up your hate of him and support the idea that he's a manipulative liar. If you liked moore beforehand, you'll find a book full of meaningless irrelevant attacks on the character of a skilled filmmaker. The right will love it, the left will hate it. Either way, you'll walk away feeling even more self-righteous than you were already."
1,Horrible Little Book by Horrible Little Men,Egad. This book is an abomination. Oozed out from under the same rock as Rush Limbaugh.
1,Propaganda,"This book is filled with half truths, misleading ""facts"" and outright lies. You know...the same things the author(s) of this book and the rest of the right-wing Moore haters accuse him of. David T. Hardy is a proven liar and if you do a quick search for him on the Internet you'll know that right away. He's also not very bright if he couldn't write a simple book on Michael Moore all by himself. Here's an idea, instead of spending so much time on Moore, why not focus on the real issues in this country? And no, Michael Moore does not hate America. Saying he does is an outright lie. You can't tell anybody they hate something. It's a personal emotion that only Moore himself can feel. Put this book where it belongs and that is back on the shelf at your local bookstore and walk out with a book by Al Franken or Mikey Moore."
1,"Painful, Painful, Painful!","Feels like highschool all over again. Yes, It's Michael Moore who's covering up the facts and I've got a great piece of swamp land I'd love to sell you. Talk to the farmers, the teachers, the children that don't have enough to eat who sit in cold, overcrowded class rooms everyday afraid they will be shot by one of their peers. Talk to those who are out of work and cannot feed their families and then talk to the parents who have lost their children in this senseless war over money. Yes, I know, it's Michael Moore's fault."
1,Offensive,This book is offensive to over weight people around the world. Could they not have just attacked Moore for what he says in his books or movies? Did they have to make fun of his weight? Was this book written by 14 year olds? All signs point to 'yes.'
1,Could he have been a dictator's lover?,"Michael Moore, aged 35 in 2002, achieved fame as a dancer, actress, photographer, and director, but his entire career is colored by her association with the Communist party. This overt tension between the political meaning of his work for Socialism and its less than essential aesthetic quality forms the basis of this compelling account. Appointed by himself, Michael Moore directed the Communist propaganda film Bowling for Commumbine along with her best-known work Olympia, a documentary of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. By 1939 Riefenstahl was arguably the most famous woman film director in the world, yet after World War II, she was never again accepted as a filmmaker. But at least she was beautiful, and her work art."
1,wait for the bargin bin,"Talk about jumping on board to make a buck . if timing is everything , these guys have done magnificant work . What a work out . A labor to get through , and in the end , it tells you nothing . But if curiosity has you in it's sway , wait till this one hits the bargin bins , it shouldn't be long . Still hungry for some good barge ? Hannity and O reilly continue to spin it up in the no spin zone ."
1,Ironic,"Though it would be true to say that those who stoop to your opponents levels lose their moral edge, it also makes the book that much better."
1,... Unlike the authors?,"Maybe in their follow-up they can provide the other half of the truth they neglected here. Bush fails to define ""freedom,"" and these guys fail to define Michael Moore. Doesn't Moore, in some sense, exemplify ""freedom""? Why oppose the messenger as much as the message?"
1,Who Profits?,"Perhaps Hardy and Clarke should prove that they are better than Moore by giving the profits of thier book to the people that Moore is exploiting? In any case this is another poorly researched book from neo-conservative ideologs. In typical conservative fashion the book places more emphasis on ad homonym attacks than research and critical analysis. While Moore is making millions on books and movies from the misfortune of others, the authors fail to point out that it is the decision of a Republican ultra conservative administration that is feeding his work and continues to fill his pockets. They also fail to point out that thier own hereos are making millions off corporate profits at the expense of the lives of my friends who have been sent to Iraq. Its only when liberals begin profiting from others misery that conservatives get self-rightous."
2,good to know the truth,"Sometime one must read drivel to see both sides. This book might have some value to understand how angry people want to present a point of view. It easier to shoot the messenger than get the truth and since Hardy is a pro-gun lawyer obviously angry at Moore since the movie Bowling for Columbine - he does try to verbally shoot Moore. After today's news 1-12-05 it is obvious lots of this book is crap and the authors can't take the truth - nor can the people who hate Moore. In case you didn't hear ""The White House acknowledged Wednesday that its hunt for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction - a two-year search costing millions of dollars - has closed down without finding the stockpiles that President Bush cited as a justification for overthrowing Saddam Hussein. ""Kinda says it all."
5,Michael Moore Is A Big Fat Stupid White Man,"This is a well written, well research account of Mr. Moore's intention to use the disastous events of others to line his pockets with money. Did Moore once consider the feelings of the families of the victims when making these movies? Thanks Hardy & Clarke for exposing the lies of this money-seeking national embarrassment. Well done!"
5,Finally fighting back!!!,"It amazing to me that some ""respected"" news sources STILL refer to Fahrenheit 9/11 as a ""documentary"" and ""non-fiction""! Between multiple exposes of its fallacies like this excellent book, and the release of the 9/11 commission report which disproves every assertion made by the big, fat, stupid, white guy, I would think that there should be some major mea culpas happening out there, not the LEAST of which should be coming from MM himself. This book is not only very well reasoned and documented, the authors have included commentary from outside sources, such as the politics and policy journal of the Democratic Leadership Council. (But, of course, the man himself would tell you that the DLC has been subverted by Vast Right Wing Conspirators.) This book (as well as the 9/11 Commission report)is MUST reading for anyone who needs to counter the MM cultists."
3,"Good book, but not great",This book does contain a lot of good information. The book does not really flow from chapter to chapter. Even if you like Michael Moore I would suggest that you read this book. Michael Moore is going to end up hurtung the democratic party more than helping it. Bill Clinton was loved because for the most part he was a postive man and not an angry man.
4,Debunks Moore,"Like a previously review stated, this is not a literary masterpiece by any stretch. But it has to be one of the more interesting reads that I have picked up in quite some time. Those who haven't read the book and are drinking Moore Kool-Aid should take a break and read the book. Amazing what this guy pulls off with editing and inserting extra footage into scenes and gets people to buy into it."
5,"At Last, The Facts In One Place","This book is a time saver. I've been able to do some fact checking on Moore's previous endeavors, but Hardy & Clarke make it easy for those who haven't got the time.Moore's trickery is finally exposed in one place. Read it now."
1,Irrelevant,"David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke's 'Michael Moore Is A Big Fat Stupid White Man' is merely a smear campaign against a person who reported on significant issues.Obviously, Michael Moore found a creative way to get people's attention. People who write political advertisements are producing the real rubbish.Where Hardy and Clarke believe Moore grew up, is extraneous to whether the president is a scoundrel. Indeed, if this book is relevant, then in the near future we should expect to see a book titled 'David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke Are Big, Fat, Stupid, White Men.'If Hardy and Clarke disagree with Moore's position, then they would do better to write a book on why they believe corporations should be free to do whatever they like; why gun owners should be unregulated; and why the president should be able to use the office to enrich his friends and himself."
1,COMPLETELY BIASED,If you are interested in right wingers point of view only this is the book for you. The title alone evokes a tone condoning judging people rather than backing statements up with facts. If you enjoy watching the rhetorics of FOX News or the O' Reilly Factor instead of hearing dual sides of the story from such sources as National Public Radio or the Washington Post...again this book is for you.
1,Keep pulling the wool over...,"I'm sorry that Michael Moore seems to anger this author so much by confronting people with the truth. It is funny to watch the proud ""conservative"" type shrivel into the grade school name-calling type. You may not like or agree with Michael Moore, but at least he motivates people to think during a time when many like Hardy and Bush just want people to follow blindly. It's amazing (for example) that over eighty percent of Bush supporters actually believe that we have found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq! Just in case you didn't know as of 10-25-04 we have not found any! No wonder people are threatened by the truth - if you start encouraging them to think and be aware they just might realize how much Bush has pulled the wool over their eyes."
1,Wow...how unoriginal and bland.,"Way to go guys, make your careers off of other people, who ever heard of these two loser authors and why are you fools buying it? You can say you don't like a man without buying someone else's horrible book...may I suggest actually reading Michael Moore instead of letting someone else make up your mind and just agree with what you already thought."
3,I totally still dont get it.,"Is this about what he says or is it about the fact that he said it? If it were a Skinny black woman, would the book have been written? Frankly, this whole concept would have been washed aside to begin with. Using his station a a dominant person in this society, he is saying stuff that many never heard said outside their homes.Weather or not you want to write a political stance on a store web site and think it will have much impact, then Um, keep typing.

Make that clear and you will have a stronger argument.I want to know this side. But so far those being its ""grass roots"" reps. are not doing such a sound job."
1,well sourced???,"No offence to those that feel this is well sourced... But I can't help but notice that the notes section doesn't actually USE footnotes. Like a high school essay, you have to leaf through the notes to try and connect them to the ""arguments."" Some claims aren't backed up at all--like the Charlton Heston Martin Luther King connection.Finally, I don't know about you, but I feel sourcing geocities websites--regardless of who makes them--is not the most reliable of info sources. Geocities? I had one of their websites when I was a kid, tinkering with the internet.In general, I found the sources to not always be of the finest calabre.Also, why use Al Franken's title to mock Michael Moore? Hard to offer a balanced criticism if you see all leftys as the same..."
1,Michael Moore Is a Big Fat Stupid White man,"Basically this book proves everything Michael Moore has ever said- they lie, deceive and manipulate- just as in this new book! If you are a liberal wanting to make an impact in the election go to moveon.org and sign up! Don't waste your money on this book."
2,Contradictions??,"Wow. How can a supporter of the current Administration write these words without being struck down?:""How does a man with so many contradictions manage to blind his enormous trove of followers to how hypocritical he really is? How does he get away with it?""It absolutely boggles the mind."
1,Poorly researched opinion presented as fact.,"I should begin this brief review with a confession, I didn't read the whole book, as I felt that after a few chapters, it just wasn't worth wasting time over, as it soon became evident that book wasn't what it said it was. Whatever one's viewpoint about the work of Michael Moore, this was a worse than poor critique, with no sources referenced, opinionated garbage presented as fact etc etcAll this rubbish will do is reinforce the modern stereotype of the Republican as an unintelligent, ill-informed, ill mannered ""redneck""!Paul."
1,No stars. Don't bother&#65533;,"This book is the typical crap that comes from those who are violently afraid of everything in life particularly anyone who dares tell the truth. Even the title is right off of a dumb ass, white trash bumper sticker and that's the ""best"" part. While filled with more propaganda than than a Bin Laden recruitment, it's all very low brow, adolescent, knee jerk attack, bereft of substance, wit and above all fact. Don't waste your time or your money and for God sakes don't fill your head with such garbage."
1,If you Can't Discredit the Message - Attack the Messanger,"This poleminc is diatribe against the producer of the documentary - with only the option to go after a person like Michael Moore when they don't refute the elements of the movie which is motivating the origin of the book. Will the book change the reaction to the movie or any of Mike Moore's books...No, and will the movie change the outcome of the election. Too early to tell - but the movie will far outlast this flash-in-the-pan reaction book and it will filter to the bottom of the pile. More luck had they tried to make a documentary - unfortunately, no one would go to a documentary on Michael Moore where as we all would go to one on G. W. Bush. You are wasting bullets on a low-value target if you get my drift...."
1,Get a life,If you don't like Moore ignore him. All you anti-Moore people accomplish is giving him more publicity and making him more popular. You're your own worst enemy. It's anti-Moore people like you who made him #1 at the box office.
1,More of Moore,"You don't like Michael Moore? Congrats! You are part of the Military/Industrial/Media Complex that runs this country. You can nit pick over small details while ignoring the fact that George Bush is a compulsive and habitual liar. For example, in the 2000 campaign Bush said that as Texas Governor he supported the Patients Bill of Rights. This was a flat out lie. He vetoed it once, and then when it passed with a veto-proof majority he let it become law without his signature. And then there are the lies that got us into Iraq. But you have the nerve to nit pick over small details in Moore's film. This book is the usual right-wing personal attack, just like Coulter's _Treason_ which is full of more errors than Swiss cheese. Do us all a favor. Grow a brain."
1,Nice work - riding the wave of Michael Moore's success.,"I love the way the opposition of Michael Moore carry on. They state these articles and then say ""LOOK! Michael Moore is a liar!"" and they don't even question the attacks on him, they just want to keep their huge tax cuts.This book does just that. It produces a load of 'facts' made up by right wing zealots to discredit moore without any factual evidence at all. It's simply an attack on a famous man to milk some of the money from the new wave politics cash cow.The fact that they make fun of his obesity is another matter altogether. Disgusting form."
1,Funny how it goes.,"I was curious about some of michaels rantings. this book proved to show me one thing. there are alot of people out to get him, and they bend their information worse than he ever did. Go Ahead and buy the book if ya want to, but you'll realize while reading it that something is amiss. This book actually made me like Mike. Kinda Ironic..."
1,Angry Right-Winger,"Well,This guy is so angry that he wrote about about Michael Moore.Why help the country in any way when you can write a book about a fat guy who makes movies?I'm looking forward to his next book on Danny Devito!Nice job."
1,"WOW, I NOW SEE THE LIGHT!!!!!!!!!","WOW, what a book!!!!!! AMAZING, the authors are right. (...) He makes money. He eats food. AND HE IS FAT -AND THAT MY FRIENDS IS A CRIME!!!!! MIKE IS A FATTY, A MONEY HUNGRY NAZI!!! AND HE HATES AMERICA.The authors are right, he should not accept cash- he should accept SEA SHELLS LIKE THE REST OF US!!!AFTER READING THIS BOOK I HAVE DECIDED THAT I DO NOT LIKE MICHAEL MOORE. Sure, he tells the truth, spreads the word that BUSH WAS ILLEGALLY ELECTED. Sure, he thinks Guns are bad. and yeah, he is looking out for his fellow americans. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE IS A GOOD MAN..BECAUSE HE IS NOT....HE LIKES THE FRENCH FOR CHRIST SAKE!!!!! AND THEY TOO ARE EVIL....BUY THIS BOOK AND SEE THE LIGHT! MIKE IS THE ANTI-CHRIST!!!!!Or understand that this book is plain and utter CRAP."
2,hmm....,"ahh... this book really shows how much conservatives love michael moore... wait... no... scratch that...conservatives don't like him... no.. wait... they despise him.So, Michael Moore has some non-factual information... who cares? It's not like you have to see/read his works.oh, and the fat part of the title... classy stuff... it just shows that liberals like moore are fat unlike many prominent conservative figures... all conservative figures are trim and fit... duh! i mean, c'mon... look at Michael Savage - he should be a speedo model."
1,Not even going to read it,"Republicans have been lying throughout the whole election, and been giving us one sided reports. Anyone who says Fox News isn't 100% bias and republican, doesn't have a TV. All news media is conservative, except for the Daily Show. Now don't get me wrong, Moore's films are absolutely bias, in favor of democrats. This is only fair because democrats have to watch the bias news, so why not watch movies that are bias in the right way, I mean right as in correct, not right wing. I am a democrat, and I'm taking the stance most republicans took towards Fahrenheit 9/11, I'm not going to read this book. Not all republicans lie, just those in power. Those not in power believe the lies and aren't open minded to say, ""Hey, he might not be right"" to Bush. This is where I relate this rant to the book. It is all republican lies about a great man. Anyone who believes it 100% without researching themselves has fallen for the republican propaganda."
1,The central assumption of this book uses flawed logic,"This book does note that there are some errors in Michael Moore's arguments. However, it blows those errors out of proportion. Moore has cited hundreds of statistics and a few of those statistics can be partly refuted. The book assumes that because of this his central arguments are flawed. The authors overlooks the fact that this is relatively insignificant because the vast majority of his facts are irrefutable. Only buy this book if you don't like rational thought. If you like demonizing people for telling the truth this is the book for you."
1,"Didn't read it, just judging the concept","Isn't it sad that nobody can attack Michael Moore in an original way? It just seems pretty elementary and immature to take the title of someone's book and change the words slightly to be making fun of them. This along with Fahrenhype 9/11 are two examples of uninspired copycats looking to cash in on Moore haters without having to strain their brains to come up with an original idea.I can here them now, ""duh, let's write a book for all the anti-Moore folks to buy up... duh, let's call it 'stupid michael moore men' or 'dude where's michael moore's brain' huh huh huh"".It's a great way to make money, but not a great way to be taken seriously."
1,sour grapes,this read is more akin to a vociferous personal attack/character assassination instead of a point-counterpoint thoughtful critique of Michael Moore's work.
1,true piece of junk,"I read this piece of junk in the bookstore because I would not spend money on this.Reading this book, I found the author really made empty arguments and based his book on taking cheap shots at moore. It is obvious the author's trying to cash in on Moore's recent success but will probably never come even close to Moore's success or talents."
3,"An Interesting Critique of Moore, Could Have Been Better","This is an appropriate collection of pieces (some previously published) debunking various material in Michael Moore's films and books. While the facts are credibly adduced, I wish the authors had avoided occasional use of the same sort of sarcastic polemics Moore himself employs -- and for that, I removed a star. One conclusion to draw from the authors' exposition is that Moore is extremely skillful at connecting with like-minded audiences who have no interest in verifying his ""reporting,"" and who do not care whether his films genuinely are documentaries. Moore's out-of-sequence editing and juxtaposition of various speakers' unrelated comments should completely disqualify his work from the ""documentary"" category of any award consideration.For those who condemn and rate this book low, please provide some examples of author error or inaccuracy. If the authors fabricated anything at all, then they -- like Moore -- deserve to be called on it."
1,More Fox Crap,"there has been a fox news drumbeat on how moore ""lies"" . But his points are never debated on their merits.RM already has enough money. Pass on this crap."
1,the book is not reporting the truth,"When Roemer asked Clarke during the commission's March hearing, ""Who gave the final approval, then, to say, `Yes, you're clear to go, it's all right with the United States government,'"" Clarke seemed to suggest it came from the White House....Clarke testified. ""I was making or coordinating a lot of the decisions on 9-11 in the days immediately after. And I would love to be able to tell you who did it, who brought this proposal to me, but I don't know. The two - since you press me, the two possibilities that are most likely are either the Department of State or the White House chief of staff's office.""(quotes from The Hill news)... so the statement the book made about Richard Clarke soley authorizing the flights of the Bin Laden family is not true."
5,"Finally, SOmeone Who Speaks the Truth about this Communist!","I hate Micheal Moore with a passion! I have read only part of this book can easily see it tells the truths about the film maker and author who warps the truth to try and turn people against the Republican Bush family and capitalism. This is a great book for anyone who believes in capitalist, anti-communist ideals."
5,"Once again, a liberal lie exposed with simple facts","Why liberals flock to be led by an idiot is beyond me. If I was a liberal I would distance myself as far from Michael Moore as possible. It seems to me that he uses his opinion and distortion of the facts to keep from getting a real job. Throughout history weak men have always been intimidated and lash out at those who make them feel inferior. I wish someone would do a study to see if liberal men are testosterone inferior, as a woman, I can't help feeling they might be."
2,BORING,"Not what i expected it to be....can't remember too much of it, which is probably a good thing I guess."
4,At last America strikes back at Moore the Moron....,Finally someone with some brains (and who clearly loves America) takes a stap at Moore and his anti-american work (which makes communism look good by contrast). Read and look at someone who truely is a stupid man.
2,Trying to Discredit Moore,I have read the book Stupid White Men and I chose to look up a lot of the information that Moore stated. I could not find one of the facts that he stated to be untrue. Along with facts he states are his opinions. That is what I believe is far left. He has a great hatred of Bush and I can't say I disagree. I believe that if you do enough independent research you will come to the same realization. This book was written to try to disect Morre's novel. They have some good points but the whole time I am reading it. I feel as though they are searching for some way to discredit Moore. They do not want to dispute facts just Moore's views. That is why I found this book not all that informative. It reads more like an arguement to Moore's book instead of offering any new information.
1,I can't believe some published this,"Unlike the authors of this book, Michael Moore actually researches everything he claims. These two baboons just rant on about what makes Michael Moore so bad and why it's ridiculous that his work is so successful. This book is based on opinion only and hardly researched. I read the first 3 chapters and could not bear it any more so I stopped reading. My advice to people looking to purchase this, don't waste your money and time. You can find a lot of critics of Michael Moore on the internet for free yet they are better researched and actually have a point to their argument rather then 'I don't like Michael Moore because Michael Moore sucks."" I'm not a fan of Michael Moore but this books is terrible."
1,Drivel Served Sloppily,"This ""book"" is silly and could have been put together by first graders. Michael Moore's abilities as a writer and as a human being soar above the authors of this hatchet job. I'm giving it one star because I can't give it no stars."
1,This book is awful!!!,"The book was horrible. Not only was the writing terrible, the title was really bad. Although so much of this is a bunch of lies by Republicans that are terrified of the truth and of their defeat on November 2, 2004, that isn't the worst part. Just the writing alone and the ideas and content is dumb. It seems like they were so desperate to retaliate against Moore that they fluffed a whole book in an attempt to save their dignity. Bad, Bad, Bad!!!"
1,Two Guys Trying to Make a Buck,"This book was written by a guy trying to make a fast buck with right-wing folks. Not very original, even the title is copied from the Rush Limbaugh book. Speaking of which, Rush Limbaugh the right-wing king of critizing others is probably their hero judging from the books title and it's difficult to respect or believe a guy like good old Rush who has critized people for years and then behaved worse than those he critized."
1,Lack of SUBSTANCE! No intelligent thought in this read.,"This book is a waste of time and money. I dislike Michael Moore, but this book straight sucks. The intro is boring and without much intellectual stimulation."
1,This book is a big fat stupid rip-off,"What else is there to say? A feeble attempt to cash in on another's success. Sad, really."
1,But far from stupid,"MM maybe big and fat but he is far from stupid. I'm guessing that most of the 5 star reviewers have not taken the time to read the book. I have and it is clear that the authors feel that MM is a threat to their way of thinking. So much so that they have to write a book, devoid of facts, in order to attack the messenger.Clearly intended for those living in denial and who feel that G. W. Bush is the greatest president ever and can do no wrong."
1,Go Michael!,Michael Moore has succeeded. He has reduced the right-wing ideologues to going into convulsions and foaming at the mouth. The name calling that one finds in the above reviews shows that he has really gotten under their skin.No longer will liberals let right wing bullies kick sand in their eyes. Moore has the guts to get down into the gutter with them and give as good as he gets.To bash Bush is to love America because he is the worst president we have had in over 100 years and is doing this country a tremendous amount of damage.
1,David T hardy is a fat white redneck,"Worst book ever!If i wanted to read a bad book I would've given pencil and paper to a duck. I have better grammar and I just started 7th grade. It was based on opinion not fact. They just hate him bec. he hates bush. The difference is Moore is actually smart political points while this guy is a liberal basher. I mean if you don't like Michael Moore don't read him. Moore has a right to critisize bec. well he's a ""political critic"" You just don't critisize a critic. It's not right."
1,The worst book ever!,"This book is a total joke. After reading a review of this book in the Economist, I really wanted to see how bad it was. Don't waste your money, this is simply a collection of badly written essays that attempt to attack Michael Moore. I would rather read a book on spelling by George Bush."
1,Time for a cleaning and rebuilting,"The only good thing about this book is it's front cover. ""That's right Mike keep on eating that White House, It needs to be demolished and rebuilt with all new ""For the People"" politicians"""
1,Pathetic,A sad attempt to discredit. Not only is the book abusing the English language but it is utterly offensive and clearly right-wing nonsense.Jump on someone else's bandwagon -- anti Michael Moore sentiment won't help you sell books.
1,"Big, Fat, White, but not Stupid","Mike's large, but he's the kind of American I aspire to be. From a humble background he rose high through his own creative drive and genius, but always stayed in touch with the less advantaged. I won't go into ""he said, she said""; but show me a Michael Moore-hater who doesn't have the social attitude ""as soon as I'm doing well, I'll kick the ladder away so nobody can catch up."""
1,Just Who Is Stupid?,"I borrowed this book from a friend because I wasn't willing to spend money on it and actually buy it. All you need to do is remind yourself that Farenheit 9/11 has already made $80 million at the box office and that Moore made it for $6 million. So just who is stupid? Michael Moore who's laughing all the way to the bank, or these two rocket scientists who are having trouble getting people to buy their book? Yeah I know it really sucks if you're a Republican."
1,What a waste of paper!,"This horrendous pile of manipulative garbage is not only a waste of paper, i feel i have wasted a portion of my life in having read it."
1,"Poor right wingers, I know it hurts","It was only inevitable that someone attempt to discredit Michael Moore in a most personal and shallow manner. Without any real response to the facts upon which Michael Moore presents his arguments and ideology, the authors' feeble attempts to respond to the first true exposition of the hyprocisy that exists in America is amusing at best."
1,Slander Teaches Nothing,"I invite you the authors, to rewrite this book. And base it more on fact then on slander.So many people are so patriotic, they see america as this perfect, flawless place and Michael Moore is telling them 'no its not' and they can't handle the idea that the government is corrupt and selling out the future's of its citizens."
1,terrible,"this book is written at a fourth grade level and I read it in 20 mins in the store. Come on guys, the footage is the footage. MM might be fat, but that doesn't change the facts he presents."
3,I loved this book!,"I loved this book! It was hilarious! The part where the author makes fun of Michael Moore was the best part, especially on page 132 where he pointed out how fat Michael Moore is! I love fat jokes! Like when Al Franken called Rush Limbaugh Fat! that was hilarious too!But the best part was on page 188 where the author wrote, ""Michael Moore sat down for breakfast in the diner of his hotel and ordered 2 servings of bacon and eggs - two!"" That was the best part, because it really showed just what Michael Moore is made of - Bacon and Eggs!And I also liked the way on page 223 that the author pointed out how far apart the red and the blue states are. I live in a blue state, so I can really appreciate the irony.Thank you for reading my review. I hope it was helpful.-bobdavisart"
2,What a waste of my time!,"Did this really require a book? Sure Moore bends the truth...he creatively edits, I'd read all that on the net long before this book came out...the problem is SO DOES EVERYBODY ELSE Mr Hardy! Ever watched Fox News? This book does make some interesting points but fails to point out that so much of what Michael Moore is saying is based in truth despite the fact that he has sensationalized it - not unlike many other ""documentaries"".The biggest problem I have with this book is that it tries to make Michael Moore out to be an enemy of (or someone who hates) America when in fact Michael Moore is someone who is standing up and saying there is something wrong with the amount of poverty in America, there is not enough money being spent on education and health in America and that there is something wrong with the amount of money being spent of weapons in AmericaMr. Hardy, how is this un-American?"
5,Finally something to combat Moore's Liberal Propoganda Machi,"I applaud both David Hardy and Jason Clarke for taking the gloves off and hitting the face of this country's biggest propogandist, not to mention socialist and America Hating jerk Michael Moore! I pity all the Libs who will shed a tear and get riled up once they see the title of this book, but if they had half the guts they do when they defend terrorists and the appeasement movement they would take the time and read this and actually learn something. But then thats asking alot so why bother when they've got their heads buried in the sand over what this country is really up against today. Why not move to France?"
3,Repetitive but important.,"The main themes of this book are:A. Micheal Moore is a Narcissistic personalityB. Michael Moore will omit, fabricate or twist facts to reach a predetermined conclusionC. Michael Moore is a hypocriteThese themes are almost painfully over illustrated and you will find yourself skipping ahead to get to new information.If you already don't like Moore, you should buy this book, skim it to reassure your stance, then pass it on to one of Moore's fans as the leave the theater after seeing Farenheit."
5,Finally some light shed on a shadowy figure...,"It's about time someone exposed this (to use Sen. McCain's remarks) disengenous film director. This book is concise and accurate in revealing the disturbing lies and falsifications that continually mark the 'aw shucks...I'm just a commoner like you folks' director's work. Armed with facts (not suppositions) and detailed information (not innuendo and sophistry), these writers lay it out for the world to see. To be honest, I wouldn't have bought the book but it was a gift to me and after reading it, I'm just glad common sense and ethics live in journalism."
3,It has its points,"I'm a Moore fan, but I agree that the book makes some interesting points. Not everything he says is 100% true. The book rehashes some old arguments found on internet sites. It also seems to imply that because Moore is a liberal, he should agree with everything Democrats say. Moore never was for Clinton.It's good that the book actually has footnotes, but the book could've layed off the childish insults."
5,Must Read for Moore Movie Viewers,"If you like Mike Moore you should read this book, if you don't like Mike Moore you should definitely read this book. I have enjoyed Mr. Moore's movies but was leery of his honesty. I came to find out I had good reason. Mike Moore doesn't hold up to will under cross-examination, and his ""interview"" with Heston is a prime example. I'll spare you the details but disgust is the only logical conclusion. I suspect that many people will be divided about this book on political lines, but the bottom line is editing is everything and Moore is an example of a talented man who takes his political agenda too far and the first casualty is the truth."
4,Moore's One Hell of a Sick Guy Indeed.,"I was suprised at how much I enjoyed this book. It's definitely a polemical work and not anywhere near dispassionate in tone. Some conservatives have looked down on it because of its stridency but I think they're short-sighted to do so. I think an irreverant, irritable response like this one is exactly what Michael Moore deserves.This book is a compilation of articles produced by the authors and various commentators (including even a writer from the Democratic Leadership Council). It's a shooting gallery of attacks on the many lies in Moore's films and written works. It's so easy to do you wonder how even the ultra biased New York Times can ethically get around doing the same thing.I heartily recommend this book. Hey, I've had it with tea and crumpet conservatives, we need more guys like Hardy and Clarke. Bravo!"
2,Couldn't they come up with a real counterattack???,"I don't think Moore is the greatest example of a liberal, and sometimes he does get a little carried away (I'm not sure I think he's as funny as he thinks he is) but he makes decent arguments, even when I disagree with him. This book doesn't do that. It's poorly researched (way too many internet sources), poorly written, and I'm being kind by giving it two stars. ****AND as a sidenote why do people want to keep arguing that you can't be liberal and rich? It's not some great hypocrisy to live an upperclass, expensive lifestyle --- with money you EARNED --- and have liberal views at the same time."
4,"Unbalanced, Acerbic,Unsophisticated, Tasteless...But Funny!","The title is a less than subtle tip-off of the book's contents. Be warned: this book is hardly an objective discourse into the life and work of Michael Moore. It's a cruel, narrow-minded, ad hominem diatribe aimed at a man who has made his fame and fortune launching personal attacks on numerous public officials. The book is a seemingly endless collection of personal attacks and doesn't let up from bookend to bookend. I'm ashamed to admit that I found myself laughing at most of the authors' low blows.It's safe to assume that Michael Moore fans will probably not like this book. The authors don't seem to care considering that, as of this review, it ranks among Amazon's Top 20 selling books."
5,The Truth Inspires Us to Act,"Thank you Hardy and Clarke, this book needed to be written. I have not seen this book in my bookstore, and can only hope people will now order it from Amazon and read it. Don't let this book sit on the bookshelf collecting dust. I have have long since read my copy and passed it on to a neighbor.The left oriented media in this country have given Michael Moore a pulpit to preach his anti-Bush and anti-conservative America position, now thankfully there is a rebuttal of some of his falsehoods. In particular, the authors dissect Moore's various works, identifying specific examples of blatant manipulation of facts and historical revision. Moore is a comedian, who unfortunately is being taken seriously by poorly informed voters. God help us all if guys like this are our future. Read this book and get the facts.Other books I would recommend: Unfit for Command, and The Enemy Within."
4,I HAVE to agree.....,"Well I picked this up cause of the title. I found this was an enlightening read for me. Guess I'm one of those that fell for all his lies. I've watched all his movies and of course, believed what I was seeing. that is..until I read this book. Well written and well researched as you can tell by the extensive Notes and Sources section in the back of the book. I'm glad I read this cause I now agree with the title."
1,Character Bashing VS Factual Critique,"This book spends the vast majority of its time degrading the character of Michael Moore rather than debunking any of the many ""lies"" supposedly contained in his work. To avoid buying this book, here's a quick summary: Michael Moore is a fat, fake leftist, who has a lot of money and has not told a single truth in any of his work.The authors' method for pointing out Moore's hypocrisy is hypocritic in itself, bending facts and often relying purely upon speculation. I believe there will eventually be a decent critical approach taken to Michael Moore's work, but perhaps the current detractors should practice what they preach and just stick to the facts. And not just facts about where Michael Moore lived as a child.This book is an evangelical work, much like Moore's own pieces, but is simply a character assasination and through its own hypocrisy will do nothing to convert even a casual supporter of Moore's overt agenda."
3,3 stars because i haven't looked at thebook,"you don't need to read it to know that these guys (neocons) rip moore (liberal mouthpiece) about a movie that suprises no one. The movie as well as the book are nothing more than I hate your side more than you hate my side. I don't think anyone here has read this book, it's just an extension of the chat site."
1,holy mother of god!!,"This is the biggest crock of crap i have ever heard. Everyone should acknowledge. what michael moore does. yes he is a radical liberal, a man from the left. But everyone who wrote a review is not going after michael moore they are going after the left. When will we work past the differences and stop pointing fingers. To boot, one of the critics on this book also rated on an ironing press. see there you go im playing your stupid f**cked game of slander now, where instead of working to make things better or god forbid say something positive about anything, besides conservatives loveing america, instead blaming our problems on moores weight. It baffles me to this day just how ignorant people are. your presented with the facts with no rebutle from the bush organization, and you say ""thats not true"". excuse me i have to go throw up"
1,Michael Moore's South Beach Davinci Code and the Goblet of F,"A day late and a dollar short, this ironically titled book is named after two bestsellers. This book will never be mistaken for a bestsellar, even if the authors retitle it 'Michael Moore's South Beach Davinci Code and the Goblet of Fire'. It is a mixed bag of personal insults and political predjudice.****SPOILER ALERT*****Michael Moore is fat, now you can save yourself 15$"
1,Lacking in Depth and Originality,"Clarke and Hardy are so used to buying into the fascist propaganda of the Bush Regime, they forgot to employ the elements of credible research and simple truth-telling. One of their masters, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, indicated that since the American people are lied to all the time, it is okay for him and his ilk to continue in that tradition. Can you imagine the contempt they must have for the average U.S. citizen? Perhaps, Rumsfeld is correct in his assessment after all since the Republicans easily won the Presidency and added to their majority in Congress in the 2004 election. Actually, I believe that H.L. Mencken was closer to the truth when he quipped, ""No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public."" We have become a very intellectually lazy people."
1,"Too Bad You Can't Rate A Book With ""0"" Stars...","Don't waste your money. The authors are (yawn) just another pair of old, white, card-carrying NRA crybabies who (like so many other old, white, card-carrying NRA crybabies) are watching their ""control of the universe"" slip away and feel threatened to see their power base waning. Michael Moore and his accurate view of reality scares them to death. This book is such a tired read - it feels like the authors did it more to capitalize and make money off an obvious ""hot button"" like Michael Moore than any real conviction on their parts. The authors would be well advised to get ready for the dawn of a new day in America. Their demographic has had its centuries in the sun and there's a whole new world about to take over and fix the mess they've caused. I'm selling my copy on eBay, but not sure there'll be a buyer -"
3,Led light addition was a waste,"I purchased this light in December. It came fast and was packaged well. At first I was very pleased, however I started to notice my Led lights were not as bright as I originally thought. Then they would begin to flicker occasionally. I thought it might be my imagination. Well it wasn't. I have had the light for about 90 days now and the Led lights don't even work. If I flip them off and then on they will come on and then flicker dimmer and dimmer until sometimes almost immediately they just shut off. Otherwise they only operate at about 15% of their original brightness. Initially when I flick them on they are bright for about 1 seconds.I would recommend not buying this model and going with the cheaper light (same just doesn't include the led lights). I wish I had gone that route and purchased a separate LED setup."
1,HORRIBLE PENS,These pens should be taken off the market. You have to play around with the tip before they write each time you go to use the pen. Not worth a dime.
3,Smooth writing pen,"Good pen, however some of the pens in the box ran out of ink in only 3 DAYS!!!! Hopefully it was a fluke."
5,Crowder is a Genius,Seriously. Genius. IQ of 153. I'm not sure how many of you are aware of that. And it comes through in every piece of the band's music- incase you were wondering why Dave's intellectual dexterity was relevant. Speaking of dexterity- the guitar sound is amazing and the band does a phenominal job of mixing gentle ballads that spill from the soul as well as upbeat tunes that will make you want to both dance and sing...
5,WOW WOW WOW....,"My only question.... ""WHERE HAS DAVID CROWDER BAND BEEN HIDING ALL THESE YEARS?"" This CD is amazing! I loved the Illumination CD and found this one and it is just as good. I mean not one bad song on it...and the voice is amazing! It is original sounding and takes a wonderful spin on to the worship songs! I have never been one to check out worship songs and I am usually disappointed in many of the current artists attempt to take on worship songs, but, David Crowder Band is a whole new look on worship songs. I sing at the top of my lungs and the beat is so good that I get soaked in the CD. I highly recommend this CD and David Crowder has to be one of the most amazing Bands to come to Christian music since wow I don't even know...just give one listen and you will be hooked!"
4,blindin',"A great follow up album from the Bristol based Hip-Hoppers, the album gets off to a flying start and is excelent all the way through. it is an album that would get any party going. stand out songs on the album are impact - a fast paced number, soul sister - a bouncy little tune, Droppin Drums - nice bit of Beatbox"
2,"""Accountants Handbook""","What is to be said for an Accountants' Handbook?When you need to reference something it is there. However, somewhat dated, this used book was rarely opened and for under five bucks delivered - looks good on the shelf!"
3,Novelty toy,"I Bought the L E D Kaleidoscope,s for myGreat Grandchildren who were loaded with plenty of standard toys. The children were fascinated with them,but it was,nt long before all the adults just had to see what was fascinating the others .Maybe not a major challenger for an Ipod or other High Tech Toy but certainly an inexpensive novelty."
2,it is just ok,This is led Kaleidoscope and i still remember when i was very young my uncle presented me one with colorful stones and it is really lot of fun. This works well but kids will not like after playing some time with it as they will get bored fasti do not say it is manufacturers fault or some thing but for me i liked stone made Kaleidoscope than led one.
2,Not a true kaleidoscope,"i am really disappointed in this product. i bought it for a friend who loves kaleidoscopes, but i am embarrassed to give it to her. Unlike real kaleidoscopes which incorporate the image of whatever you're looking at with the little pieces of flotsam inside, never showing the same pattern twice, this battery operated tube displays a series of about 6 different patterns that repeat. It's ok for as long as it takes to view all the patterns 2 or 3 times, but frankly, it takes more time to install the batteries than it takes to get bored with this thing.If you are looking for a novelty piece to add to your collection, then get it.But if want a REAL kaleidoscope buy something else. This certainly has no educational value, and will hold the interest of neither children nor adults for more than a minute or two."
5,Gift,"This was for my husbands Christmas present. He has a guitar by the same company. He said he loves it. The craftsmanship is just beautiful. The pictures do not do it justice. He did however, already break 2 strings trying to tune it, so I suggest buying extras at the time of purchase."
2,Not Her Best,"Jill Phillips is great, but this is not the album I'd use to prove it to someone who didn't know her already. Some of the tracks are hymns with intact original words and melodies, and others are varying degrees of new melodies to old words or just plain new songs. There's been a lot of ""new melodies for old hymns"" in the last few years by various CCM artists. That's typically been most successful for hymns whose original melodies were less than spectacular. In this case, Phillips does best on hymns whose original melodies were already great, like ""Praise to the Lord, the Almighty"" and ""What Wondrous Love is This."" The new melodies, and the new songs, don't reach the same level of excellence."

4,4 out of 5,"Good spice, but missing something....no kick if you will...Used it in a pumpkin pie-great, but on a pumpkin spice latte-just not what it should be..."
2,Half Filled,"My first time ordering/using this product as I am restocking for my seasonal/holiday baking. Hoping I'm not going to be disappointed how ever I'm confused about the size of the Apple Pie Spice, it's in a 16oz bottle but the label says 8oz when I compare it to the 8oz bottle of Pumpkin Pie Spice It's about 2-3 oz less. I intend to contact the seller about this matter because I have more items in my cart I want to purchase, hoping I don't have to change my mind of course. I will keep you posted on the outcome."
2,Same issue,The description is very misleading and doesn't mention that it is only one episode with three or four stories only. I thought it was a whole season.
1,this item never arrived and i have sent messaqges to amazon with no responce disgusting,never arrived and messaged amazon many times with no responce disgusting disgusting treatment from amazon i will keep trying to get my goods or a refund
3,The Same Problem,"I agree with the other posts. I was so excited to see this on DVD, but it was not listed as being so short! I thought I was getting the entire season. Why is it $22 for only 45 minutes worth of stories? I wish they had released more episodes. A few years ago, I wouldn't be this annoyed, but the economy sucks. I hate that I spent this much money on so litte ."
1,celebrity ghost stories,"I was very disappointed to receive only one 47 min dvd, when I thought I was buying the entire 9 dvd collection as the ad states. I find this very misleading and I will be hesitant to order anything else."
1,Rip off,"For once, the reviewers have it right. For 24.95 they give you ONE episode. Absolute rip off. I am very disappointed and cannot believe that the producers of this show would be so ignorant and arrogant to give you one episode for that much money. One season worth of this show would be more like it. Maybe we should all just complain and get our money back? Very very disappointed."
5,The Master,"This is peerless, majestic small group jazz. Ray Brown and Jackson never sounded better together, which is saying something. Gene Harris is the icing on the cake. In his non MJQ guise Jackson always seemed to react well to strong pianists (Monk, Monty Alexander) and this is no exception. Much underrated. Buy it."
1,Kwestion for Keith,"..why does a genius of your caliber feel the need to sound like a watered-down version of Mannheim Steamroller, when in fact Mannheim Steamroller is a watered-down version of YOU?!"
5,A THOROUGHLY-RESEARCHED AND WELL-WRITTEN ACCOUNT,"I found this book to be a breath of fresh air after the litany of sloppily-composed and researched books that have come out about the most recent war against Iraq. The writer, while a former marine, presents a fair and moving account of this 'first battle of the smart bomb age.' Storm on the Horizon, while ostensibly about the 1991 war, speaks volumes about our current predicament in Iraq and should be read by all those interested in events in that corner of the globe. Highly recommended."
4,"A good incentive for staying employed at all costs, lol","Author Ehrenreich went undercover, posing as an unemployed middle class white-collar worker looking for a job. As she threads her way through career counselors, resume services, networking sessions, and the dreaded obstacle, The Gap, she finds herself no closer to a real job. The jobs she is offered are those that she estimates 31% of the US workforce now holds: sales jobs with companies like Aflac and Mary Kay that offer no salary, no benefits, and often no workplace. The alternative for many of her fellow job-seekers are ""survival"" jobs, that pay little but take up too much time for the job holder to actively seek another job. In the final chapter, Barbara returns to her real life with the conclusion that there is something very wrong here, and some suggestions for how society should fix it."
3,"I really like Barbara Ehrenreich, I didn't like this book =(","Barbara Ehrenreich is one of my favorite authors. Coming from someone who actually worked in the field, she gave really great insight. I wish she had better ways of solving the problems though."
2,Bait and Switch - an appropriate title,"It was a classic bait and switch - the title, the futile pursuit of the American Dream baits you. Then you're switched to putting up with page after page of over-critical analysis of everyone that is not like the author. There were very few people the author complimented - the rest were there to be made fun of.It came across like author thought they must be idiots if the don't offer ME a job... The author also failed to hide her contempt for anything Christian. She devotes several chapters to putting down various faith-based groups.Having written this, however, I won't give it one star because the process of looking for a job was interesting. The book would have been much better putting together objective information and leaving the editorializing behind."
1,"Grinding, Boring, Self-indulgent","Barbara Ehrenreich sets out to experience ""corporate America"" but ends up critiquing the job search process itself. She doesn't like it. She seeks out the kind of career coaches who hand out lists of do's and don'ts for the job interview e.g. 1. Do not fart or belch during an interview; 2. A halter top should not be worn to a job interview; 3. Shower at least 24 hours before a job interview; 4. a tote bag is not a brief case; 5. do not open more than two buttons on your blouse.And so on. Unfortunately, the author could use some basic tips on how not to be an offensive job seeker, author, or person. Despite being a lazy [...], she got two job offers, both of which she turned down. The were apparently beneath her."
2,This book is a Bait and Switch -,"A commentary on the pitiful state of the corporate world by an author who doesn't get a job in the corporate world and gives loads of negative commentary based on her research of the perpetually unemployed. Hint: The perpetually unemployed may have their own issues which aren't related to the company they once worked for -Here's an idea - Actually get a ""white-collar"" job and include more interviews with the vast majority of gainfully employed corporate workers and then...give me your commentary. (Like the superb Nickel and Dimed)."
1,A failed job search,"This is a book about an older woman who decides to look for a job in order to give us---her readers--an ""inside"" look at corporate America. It ends up being a book about a disgruntled writer's futile and half-hearted attempts to find a job. She is contemptuous of everyone she meets, or almost everyone. Her descriptions are spiked with spite. I felt dirty after reading sections of this book.The book fails on the basic level of good journalism. She does not really try very hard to find a job and when she is offered employment, she turns it down with an angry flourish. She did not do her homework and when she found out it wasn't easy to find a job, she shifted her focus and ""stumbled upon"" Christian networking groups--which she despised. I was disappointed with this book, and yes, like so many other unimpressed readers, I took the bait."
1,One woman's bizarre journey,"Barbara Ehrenreich has done one HECKUVVA job in producing this book. From the start, she trumpeted her goal: find a corporate job and show readers what the professional workplace is REALLY all about. Despite a. not finding a job (or, better said, one that was not beneath her); and b. not experiencing the corporate world she sought to experience--Ms. Ehrenreich brilliantly manages to construct 200 plus pages of prose. Here is what we learn. She hires career coaches. She uploads her resume to various job sites. She edits her resume. She re-edits her resume. She goes to job fairs. She goes to ""networking"" events. She has a makeover.As all of this may suggest, I found the book lacking in, well, content. I also found some of her criticisms utterly grotesque. She clearly had no clue, or, she didn't want to work and intentionally sabotaged her own job search. And what does she have against Christians? Coming from a self-professed liberal, I found her views hypocritical and mean."
2,Half-baked look at professional employment,"First of all, I agree with the reviewer below who notes that the attractive young woman on the cover is definitely NOT Barbara Ehrenreich. Only after reading the book does the reader discover that the real Barbara Ehrenreich is almost ready to sign up for social security. Even a makeover (described in the book) can't disguise the fact that she is pushing 60 and is marketing herself as a PR guru who has ONLY consulted.The book is about Enrenreich's bumbling efforts to find a job after a lifetime spent, well, as a writer, writing columns and books and speaking. She spends most of her time going to job fairs and career counselors, trying to ernestly explain why she has never held a job, despite decades of high-profile consulting.Please.One other point. Ehrenreich states she is middle class. How middle class can she be with a bestseller on the NY Times bestseller list?"
1,A job search strategy for the mentally challenged,"I cannot recommend this book because it says nothing interesting or original. Barbara Ehrenreich spends most of the book bitching about her inability to find a job. She blames everyone but herself. No offense Barbara, but you aren't exactly a spring chicken. At 60+, you aren't exactly on the corporate fast track. This is a 200+ page exercise in futility."
3,Auntie Mame Goes to Work,"I found this book very entertaining. Like the reader below, it reminded me of the adventures of Mame. Barbara Ehrenreich, a bon vivante job seeker who pursues an unattainable job (and life) in perpetual soft focus."
3,Maybe she wasn't qualified?????,"I should have stopped reading this book after the first chapter. I kept reading because I was going to review Bait and Switch for the local newspaper. Without repeating what other reviewers have said I have to say that the book certainly didn't live up to my expectations. With all the coaching, training, interviewing, and endless reflection, I kept wondering whether she was not getting hired because she wasn't what she claimed to be. May the system worked after all.I couldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Worst kind of self-indulgent crap.,"Preface: I loved Nickel and Dimed. It was not rigorous scholarship, but it gave insight into blue-collar existence that white-collar folks forget.This book, however, is the worst kind of self-indulgent crap. Babs faxes out a few resumes and goes to a few job fairs, then whips out a book about how haaaaaard it is to get an advertising job.The only interesting angle, about the scores of motivational speakers and networking groups that rip off desperate job seekers, is nearly ignored."
1,'No One Will Hire Me!!',"That's the plaintive cry of Barbara Ehrenreich in this much overdone, pointless and impertinent memoir. In reality, the book is a two-hundred page expanded diabribe about the author's failed attempt (?) to find a well-paying job in corporate public relations. She walks around with an angry scowl etched on her face--a sulky and entitled matron grasping a dog-eared, fabricated resume. Her naivite about the job search process would astonish an 18 year old work study student. Get real Barbara. A true job search takes energy, courage, and persistence."
1,There is no hope?,I doubt Mz Ehrenreich is really as cynical as she comes across in this book. If she is I hope she gets counseling and/or medication. Fortunatly every one she meets who is of sub standard integrity has physical characteristics that signal their dubious character. The bad guys/gals (who happen to be everyone who purports to want to help her find a job)might as well wear black hats.It is too bad this book is so horribly jaundiced because there are some good points that could be made. We will have to hope that someone else writes the book this could have been.
1,Don't waste your time,"This book was a total waste of my time:- No research or supporting evidence of whatever she is trying to prove- She attempts unsuccessfully to gain employment with a false resume with no practical experience- Her techniques to find work are going to job fairs and self-help groups (no networking, direct contacts, etc.). All she proved is that ""she"" could not get a job- I grew very tired of her continual self-glorification and mockery of everyone else she came in contact with"
1,Bait and Switch is Right,"I can't fairly comment on the entire book because after I read about half of it I tossed it in the trash. I assume that the purpose of the book -aside from a means to make the author money - was to prove the futility of using counselors and tests in order to find a job. The author went to great lengths to avoid doing the things she should have done -looking in the wanted ads on line and networking. Of course since she was not really looking for a permanent job but pretending to it might have been difficult to carry off this scam indefinately. In any event, she takes great pleasure in knocking everything about members of job hunting groups and the people she paid. It is not an easy to read book and drags on. It wasn't worth donating to the Friends of the Library."
2,poorly executed,"I was very disappointed with this book. I felt the author went about the project in a lacksidaisical manner. It was poorly researched and executed. It is an insult to the people it is supposed to highlight, the victims of corporate downsizing and indifference. A much better book on this topic is Then We Came to the End: A Novel by Joshua Ferris."
3,An Unusual Job Search,"This book chronicles a respected author's discouraging attempts to find gainful professional employment. Barbara ""Alexander""--a semi-fictional person--is an older woman who decides to test the waters to see if she can find a real job. She puts on her Sunday best and beats the pavement, unsuccessfully. For some reason, she spends much of the book taking personality tests and meeting with career consultants. She also undergoes a severe make over, all in an attempt to find that illusive job in ""PR.""I would recommend this book to someone looking for a job, not because Ehrenreich was successful, but rather because it demonstrates what doesn't work."
2,Like a bad sequel to a good movie,"""Nicked and Dimed"" was powerful as an intimate description of the low-wage world. A job never materialized here because of some bad assumptions. She assumed that, since her publishers have in-house PR, other companies do also. But most use outside firms. Did she even target PR firms? (started skimming after second chapter.) Barbara is a good writer and always pleasant to spend time with but this was, unfortunately, a poorly-thought-through undertaking."
3,"Interesting, but has holes","I read Bait and Switch on a four-hour plane ride. It was entertaining, but I found it a tad intellectually dishonest. While Ehrenreich introduces readers to some colorful characters, she's obviously making points she set out to make. While I share her sympathies entirely, it's tough believing that she could not land a job. The deck was stacked. I would have preferred reading a real profile, not a character created to meet a need."
1,Barbara Ehrenreich: An Eldery Bigot Looks For A Job?,"Is she a bigot? You, the reader, be the judge. After reading this book, I concluded she hates fat people, and Christians aren't far behind on her list. She also snipes an older, successful businesswoman, comparing her to a tranvestite. Barbara, why do you write books denigrating people if you claim to be a self-righteous liberal? Maybe you should examine your bigoted views before you write your next hate book trashing transvestite-looking women and fat people (e.g. the ""great Valentine"" of a woman you met) and others who do not conform to your world view.I am disgusted. Disgusted that a self-proclaimed ""holier than though"" quote unquote liberal could write a book filled with ad hominem complaints about people she would rather not deal with or look at. How would you like it if someone branded you older, wrinkled, and angry?"
2,"Barbara, your contempt is showing","I love NICKELED AND DIMED because I believe in Ms. Ehrenreich's compassion for the waitresses and hotel maids among whom she posed and about whom she wrote. Reading BAIT AND SWITCH has been an entirely different experience for me. I sense that she has contempt for white-collar workers who have dared to reach for the American Dream and fallen out of the workforce, and who face foreclosure on their homes, forfeiture of their children's college plans, and the inability to pay their medical bills.The book's exposition of the predatory ""transition industry""--a profession largely driven by glib and facile laid-off white-collar workers--is very valuable, but I shudder at her sarcastic and sometimes cruel evaluations of the people who are vulnerable to the predators."
2,"biased, selective, scarstic",the focus on few loser in the networking process ignores those who got the job and left networking.the criticism of the self-help movement is inspiring but plays the victimization game that individual problem is entirely the product of the environment and the fault of somebody else.too much inappropriate and distracted remarks.
3,At least it's entertaining,"I was required to read this for my college English course. Ehrenreich writes of her experience to attempt to be part of the white collar world. In the beginning she spews out a few fact of unemployment and unemployment rates in the United States among middle aged persons but then she writes more of her own journey. Ehrenreich takes on a fake personality, attends job fairs, unemployed club meetings, and hires career coaches to get her to the next level. I thought the book was somewhat entertaining and an easy read. Nothing spectacular though, just a documentary about her middle age unemployment scheme."
3,Disposable employees,"Depressing, frightening, but unfortunately true. I've been there and am blessed to have lived long enough to retire on pension. Obviously this is the first time she's ever tried to look for a white collar job. I wouldn't use this as a guide 'cause she's nieve enough to go to ""coaches"" and ""resume writers"". Volunteers will do this for free at the unemployment office. She does redeem herself on the last three pages of the conclusion. So when is she going to start a support group or try to change the system? She could also do a critique on the interview process, which is where the actual bait and switch comes in to play. Needs a more realistic title. But she writes well."
2,Would anything meet her standards?,"I found this to be one of the most overwhelmingly negative books I have ever read. It is hard for me to recall any positive opinions conveyed in this book. True, those who are job seaching tend to comisserate with others in the same lot, but that is not their fault, just as those with chronic diseases meet with each other, not the doctors who can help them. From restaurants, to religious events, to coaches, nothing is ""good"" or productive.The book is brutal to those institutions and individuals whose approach or philosphy the author disagrees with."
2,UNINFORMATIVE,"The title is misleading. As usual, Barbara shoots from the hip. Her condescension and sarcasm are typical of her style. She starts with her own hypotheses and wastes the reader's time trying unsuccessfully to prove them. I have found her wrong in many areas. Especially in health care issues. In general, I have little respect for the lady. She has limited knowledge, but, somehow, has devloped a writing career out of pure gall."
2,You May Feel Baited If You Buy And Read This Book,"The dust jacket of this book is extremely misleading. It depicts a pretty young blond woman with clapsed hands and a worried look--presumable interviewing for a ""corporate"" job.Turns out the book is about a woman in her 60s who decides to look for her first real job. Ms. Ehrenreich seems to think she is a spring chicken or something. (She sort of reminds me of Lucille Ball's exaggerated recreation of the character ""Mame."") By the end of the book, and her job hunt, she receives, not one, but two job offers--from Mary Kay and from AFLAC--two respect American companies. Neither job was acceptable to her, for reasons unexplained.Ms. Ehrenreich is awkward and arrogant throughout the book. She harbors a lot of resentment."
1,Another Call for Failed Socialism,Just more crying from those who think government is the answer. The individual is. Don't waste your money on this trash.
1,I had to go BM's after reading this book,"Barbara Ehrenreich--everyone's favorite commie-liberal-- is the kind of woman Archie Bunker would have reviled. In this 200 page tome, Ehrenreich writes with conviction about her efforts to find a corporate job using a fake resume and a series of placement professionals who urged her to rewrite her resume and undergo an extreme makeover. Against all odds, she found two jobs--both of which she summarily turned down for reasons unexplained. So instead of a book about the evils of corporate America, we are treated to a book about--what?--an eldery woman's unsuccessful job hunt?Honesty is a valuable trait for any journalist. I felt tricked after buying this book when I realized that Barbara Ehrenreich is NOT the attractive blond woman on the cover. It's bizarre that the author allowed this bit of sophistry. The much older i.e. real Barbara Ehrenreich is the subject of this long, dull, and painful essay."
2,Too Out of Touch Herself,"She wastes the first chapters, and my time, going to extremes with kooky consultants that only someone who doesn't deserve to be hired would use. It adds to the drama and despair I suppose, but it comes off as contrived, and as an attempt to pander to her extremist/pessimist reading coterie.I don't think Babs could have possibly put more words in quotations. Her OCD with quotated words and terms is a distraction that ultimately drove me nuts. I can't believe she's an accomplished writer.Her writing style can best be described as unsmooth and read-stoppage inducing.Oh well, her intentions were good!"
2,Not as good as Nickle and Dimed,I did not like this book as well as the Nickle and Dimed book. Too much time was spent in the book discussing the job search preparation and it got boring at times. The first and last part of the book provided most of the content of this book. Overall was a little disappointed in this book.
1,Academic cannot find a job,"While the book has some interesting anecdotes about shucksters who prey upon unemployed white collar workers, the overall tone is that if Barbara cannot find a corporate job then the system must have failed. Despite having absolutely no real life work experience she feels as if she can pose as a PR Manager. After a year of trying she can't. So if an academic book writer cannot fake her way through corporate america, then the system must be flawed, or perhaps it is her high level of intelligence that must be getting in the way. That's it, she is just too smart to have a job."
3,Not what I expected,Well it was a nice story of the turns in her life but not much other than anecdotal information. I do look forward to her next offering.
2,How not to look for a job,"I also loved Nickel and Dimed, but was disappointed in this book. The writing is engaging, but the content is pretty worthless. I agree with the other reviewers on two main points. 1) She is looking for a job she is not qualified for. Nobody gets vary far that way. 2) She is pursuing the most pathetic means I've heard of to get there, paying complete idiots and looking to other unemployed people to help her.For the record, I have used a career coach before, and she was nothing like this. She was professional, extremely clued in, and a big help.Her summary seemed to be making some good points, but by that time I was so discourage by the quality of the book that I just didn't finish it."
3,"Interesting, discouraging, depressing.","Not as captivating for me as ""Nickel & Dimed."" Left me feeling like I'd rather stick with WHATEVER job I have than go back into that rat race of resumes and job interviews!"
3,"Factual and Well Written, but Depressing and Unhelpful","Everything she writes about the job search is true. From my own personal experiences, I can say I have had all of the same experiences she had in the search for a job. However, I was hoping to draw some encouragement or insight from this book and I did not. All it did was confirm everything I was already aware of. The only take-away from the book is that unemployed people should band together and form a movement for universal healthcare and the author only spends two paragraphs (the last 2) addressing this. I think my time would have been better spent re-reading ""Ask the Headhunter"" which actually gives useful information about job searching."
4,A Middle Class in decline,"The author offers a sobering look at the plight of the white-collar unemployed and the ""transition"" industry that offers them counselling, prayer, and dubious advice - at a hefty price, of course. Particularly hard hit are the middle-aged workers who have fallen victim to sudden lay-offs or down-sizings. After years of loyalty to their employers, and years of playing by the rules, they now find their companies have no such loyalty to them.This book is mostly about the industry that has come into being for the sole purpose of ""coaching"" these ex-employees so that they can find new jobs. In reality, they are seldom helpful at all.In the final chapter, Ms. Ehrenreich points to the fact that the middle class is under attack as never before. Just look at the bankruptcy bill, the attempts to eliminate Social Security, and the loss of company pensions and health care. Reading this book will be a wake-up call for many. Feeling secure? You shouldn't. You could be next."
2,Not all its cracked up to be,"This attempt by Ehrenreich to cover the other end of the job spectrum falls well short of the effort showed in Nickel and Dimed. To give her credit, it is a lot easier to portray the lower classes than it is to move up. The biggest fault of this book is that it never shows the agnst that white-collar job seekers go through on a day-to-day basis to make ends meet while trying to find a job, at least until the final chapter. Then, and only then, do we hear from the people who took lower paying jobs, or any job, to stay alive. While her approach in N&D; made you feel you were there and feeling the pain, Bait never came close.While there are some humorous bits about job coaches, the outcome was a big 6 month waste of Ehrenreich's time."
1,How NOT to find a job,"The book is about the author's misguided efforts to find a professional job, one offering a $60K salary, benefits, and job security. To no one's surprise, perhaps even herself, she does not find this ellusive job (though she does receive a couple of other job offers that she indignantly turns down). Why was she so unsuccessful? For one thing, she is relatively old to be starting a career. By my arithmetic--and the photograph on the inside back jacket--she was well over 60 at the time she started looking for a job. It's interesting how people kept telling her she needed a makeover--clothes, makeup, the works.Throughout 200+ pages of whining, she complains constantly and bitterly about the vagaries of the job market and how much work (and driving) and TIME is required to look for a job. She just can't get her act together. No wonder she didn't find a ""good"" job."
5,Allow Me To Be Frank At The Commencement......You Will NOT Hire Me,i can identify with this book.it's a great read from start to finish and the more i listened i was nodding my head in agreement with the narrator. i have it on compact disc and it flows smoothly.things that i didn't know before were pointed out in this book.
5,Ehrenreich Nails it Again!,"For anyone who has ever looked for a job, or even had a job, there is so much in this book to relate to that it will hit home with almost everyone. And as usual, Ehrenreich's finely-honed wit makes it a joy to read.What is ""corporate culture?"" Why do we have to hide or re-make our personalities to fit into it? Must we turn into gray-flannel-suited automatons to be good corporate employees? Are we, both men and women, over the hill at 40? Why is it so hard to get a decent job in this country?Ehrenreich explores these and many other issues in this funny, sad, angry, wistful, extremely well-written book. Buy it -- you'll like it!"
4,Divine Witness,"Reality has to be suspended a bit for this one in parts but it's quite enthralling. Action and adventure abound pretty much from the beginning as Nick and Trevor discover a chest containing human bones. Upon placing a headband found in the chest, upon his head, Nick has visions of startling events which occurred several years in the past. What is seen in these visions is bizarre enough to be likely especially considering that someone is going to lengths to quiet them. They have no idea who they can trust and really, who would believe the veracity of visions?While I might say this book is for youth since the children are only about eleven - twelve years old, there are situations and talk which would compel me to place this on my young adult shelf. I'm not suggesting it doesn't happen but am astonished to think that mere children think and talk about adult subjects at a progressively younger age."
1,Poor Formatting,Never got a chance to read this book as it is NOT formatted correctly and half the page is missing!!
3,"Decent, often good, but not ""blues""","Frankly, the title is quite misleading, approaching false advertising. These are for the most part, not ""blues"" at all, but fingerstyle guitar pieces, mostly in the Nashville/Chet Atkins style. All of them owe some compositional debt to traditional blues, but the influence is sometimes very, very faint.Now there are some very nice pieces in here: I'm particularly fond of Tim Sparks' ""Blues on Bartok Street"". But as good as that tune is, it has as much in common with what anyone thinks of as blues as any of Bartok's own compositions, which is to say nothing at all.In short: blues this ain't. If you're hoping for an anthology of basic country/Piedmont/Chicago standards (or even styles), look elsewhere. Stefan Grossman's books are a good start."
4,For Advanced Players,A little over my head for someone just starting out. Saving it for when I get good enough to understand it.
4,Those Great Memories,"Pepe is both reminiscent and simplistic as a writer, not exactly a bad combination for a book on 1970s baseball. The book takes us back - in terms of players, teams, championship play-by-play, and photos - to perhaps one of the greatest eras in all of professional sports. Being a NY'er, Pepe puts great emphasis on the American League, and especially the Yankees. There is some good gossip here, especially of the clubhouse variety. If you loved this era and want to relive it for 400 pages, I heavily recommend this."
4,baseball nostalgia for the hard-core fan,"If you are a baseball purist and want an in-depth review of the decade of the 70s, this is your book! The collection of photographs alone is worth the price. Some of the transcripts from players and officials of the game are illuminating but I would have liked to have heard from some conspicuously absent notables (where is Pete Rose, for example?). But that is a small nitpick - I love reliving this decade and it brought back the memories!"
3,An Oral History of *New York* Baseball,"The Yankees were a fairly miserable team for most of the 70s, but you wouldn't know it from reading Pepe's book. It seems like every five pages we're back to a multi-page Yankees story, and if it's not the Yankees, it's the Mets. Several successful teams are grossly underrepresented; we hear about the Pirates, for example, only from Rennie Stennett. Several spectacular players are also rarely mentioned; Lou Brock appears only near the end and only as an afterthought, for example.What there is in this book is very well done, however, and a treat for those who remember baseball in the 70s - or for those who don't, and have no idea just what it meant to play against Pete Rose."
4,Great Value !!! can not beat it !!,Great fixture!! Great price and great quality. Great service!! fixture was $5 cheap next day and recieved lesser price and fast shipment with tracking number next day.
5,a wonderful book,This book has alot of information on Jesus and his family.It is a good book to increase your knowledge on the greatest person to ever walk on our Earth.
5,"Jesus, the man of God","Tabor's handling of this most important subject is laudable. Through his book, Jesus, the man of God, looms larger and is far more impressive than the iconic contrivance history made him become. This book shines a beacon all the way down the long, dark tunnel of Church history, to a Jewish man who followed his God all the way to the cross."
4,Intriguing Concepts,"I really enjoyed this book. I've always had a lot of curiosity about the real, historical Jesus and this book provides some compelling insight as to what his life, teachings, and movement were really based on. There a lot lot of solid references and citations, but there are times that the author might be making a bit of a leap with conjecture. But that's OK. At least someone is taking a bold step on attempting to eliminate the Theology and Dogma from the actual life of Jesus."
2,Tough reading!,"Maybe I'm a little dense, but this book jumped way too much and assumed the reader had a greater understanding of history. The book was touted as a starting point for those wishing to learn, but found the reading way too hard. Never could finish."
5,Impossible to put down,"This book makes some bold leaps of historical imagination that some may feel go too far. But the author bases his speculations so firmly on informed textual analysis and archaeological discoveries that they carry the ring of truth. Tabor's involvement with claims made about the Talpiot tomb may undermine his credibility simply because they seem so sensationalistic, but he deserves to be listened to. Whether you accept his conclusions or not, you will find The Jesus Dynasty fascinating reading. [...]"
5,Still teaching me!,I was a student of Dr. Tabor's in the early 1980s. I learned more from him in a 3 credit course at ND than I did in all my years at Catholic school and at Notre Dame. Still a great treacher and the book is a great read. Dr. Tabor presents the historical Jesus which we as Christians may not be able to accept.
5,Bravo !,"I have no problem in giving 5 stars to Tabor's book. I first purchased an audio version of this book and found it so interesting that I bought the book itself.The book is very readable and full of surprises. Christians have been presenting one sided information regarding Christ and ignore all other possibilities in the name of faith.Tabor's book presents Jesus from the "" miracles are not possible"" perpective. Drawing on books outside of the NT, Tabor gives us interesting possibilities to ponder. These possibilities are never treated as facts but stir up our brain waves and widen our horizon. The book is really a treat."
2,So this is where they got it from?,"Tabor does several twists and turns to arrive to the conclusion here, and pieces bits and pieces of a chain to support it. One chain off and the whole thesis falls apart.Claims:1. Jesus wasn't God.2. Jesus' father was not God OR Joseph.3. Jesus' father was possibly a Roman soldier named Pantera.4. Argues that James, the brother of Jesus and Paul were two conflicting versions of Christianity.5. Paul's ""Christianity"" won out.6. Believes on the hypothetical text (Q) being the source of the gospels (yet no archaeological evidence supports it).And you guessed it, none of the claims have any evidence. So for a FICTION work, this is great. For a scholarly, historic work? The Da Vinci Code was better."
1,Steaming pile of poo!,"James Tabor studies ""Religion"", not Christianity. He denies the truths of history and starts from a position that the Bible is wrong. From there you can spin off in any number of incorrect directions. This book will appeal to those who refuse to believe the truth of God's Word anyway. Yes, it's well written and yes, he presents his arguments cleverly -- but so did Satan. Sadly there will be those who are seeking to know God and His Son Christ Jesus who will pick up this book and be led astray, possibly missing out on eternity with Him.Bottom line, if you're lacking in discernment and reasoning, you'll probably like this and probably liked Dan Brown's horrible book as well."
2,This is a gentle use item,"I found that the brackets where the cot sections open and close are constructed of a light gage metal and they bend easily, which makes it easy to bend them back. While this item is serviceable extra care must be taken in setting up and putting away. This is an item best used on very level ground as the cot sways under you when placed on an incline. Makes a great fold away bed for unexpected guests in your home. Despite the companies claims this bed in no way is even close to Mil. Specifications. I have kept mine for my ten year old son to use."
2,"Far from complete, even from a beginner's point of view.","Most probably because it written by a number of people, the book lacks consistency. The first part is quite good and there is a no-nonsense approach. Important things are taught, and without much fuss.However, the downfall starts from the ""Advanced"" section of the book. The chapter on API is takes just a cursory glance at VB and API, to say the least. This trend starts here and continues where OOP in VB is introduced. I have no clue why these important chapters were given so little space.The problem with this book is, it tries to cover too much, with too little detail. In the end, you are left with a very much incomplete book. Example: Important concepts like early binding and late binding were nowhere discussed, at least not with the names.I think Wrox's ""Beginning VB 6"" may be a better choice, but the problem with Wrox ""Beginner"" series is that, they just talk on and on and on till you are completely insane."
2,real VB developers don't buy this book!,"This book is tailored for ordinary users of VB only, not developers of VB. This book does not provide the necessary details of programming, and other advanced features. If you need to work on VB, probably this book is not for you. For novice users, this book can give you a smell of what VB is. The examples used in this book is rather small scaled."
2,Very Basic VB,"If you are use to the ""USING"" series by QUE, you will find this issue a bit disappointing. This book while great for those new to VB, will be lacking the usual technical depth that made the other QUE books great references."
2,Gerber sizes run small!!!,"My son is very small for his age - 5 months and only 11 lbs. - so these should fit him according to the sizes but they don't. None of the Gerber clothes have fit him - newborn was too small, 0-3 too small, 3-6 too small. They work fine and are comfortable but I would recommend buying the next size up for your little one."
1,Warning! Size chart is not accurate,"I bought the 6-9 month size and they are the same size as the 3-6 month size. What a waste of money. I had already washed them, threw away the receipt and packaging, and put them on him and they are way too small. Save the packaging and receipt so you can get your money back."
1,A very bad Purchase,"The size of 18 months seems newborn, it is extremely small, and the picture show in the back the brand of Gerber but the productes that I recived don't have it and the fabric quality is very bad too.I'm dissatisfied with the product"
3,"Gerber 5-Pack Solid Onesies, 18 months","Although these onesies are cute to look at, the fabric is on the thin side and after just one wash, they shrunk in cold water wash to the size close to 9-12 months than the usual 18 months size. I would not recommend to buy it for your baby if he/she is more than 20 lbs."
3,Like them but they fit small.,My son is 4 months old he still fits into all his 3 months clothes but they are starting to get tight so i purchased this in 3-6 month thinking that would be the next bigger size. When I receive them and they are tight on him. I still think they are super cute and love the colors but if i would have known it fit like a 0-3 month and not 3-6 month like it stated I would have bought the next size bigger.
2,too small!,"i bought 3-6 months set. there's no way my new born nephew will fit in it. besides the material is super thin!the picture provided to show the product on the site are inconsistent with real product.pretty colors and good quality. but it doesn't really matter, as the product can't be used."
4,cute but very small,Just bought it and then found a very similar packet for sale at Target for 1 dollar less.They are cute but very small - you should never buy the one for newborns (may never fit the baby). Better to pick the ones for 0-3 months or 3-6 months - and have in the mind that these will probably fit newborn babies.
1,Actual size does not tally with size chart,"I ordered the 18 months ones and I am very surprised that the onesies cannot even fit my 7 month old who is barely 70cm and weighs 8kg.Now, I am stuck with 2 packs of them and am not even sure that a newborn can even fit into them."
3,Small size,The size 12 month was too small for my 9 month old. Guess I should have read the reviews before ordering!
3,So small,"To small for the wheight 3-6 monthsIts to small, but it have pretty colorsSpanish:Muy chico para la medida 3-6 meses, pero en lo personal los colores eran muy bonitos, y mas en si la tardanza fue muy poca. Para que sepan si piden de 3-6 meses, sera para recien nacido. Vuelvo a reiterar que la medida es muy chica para la medida real."
1,too small for a 12month,"I bought these for my baby to grow into and at 9months she is not able to fit into them, while she wears size 9 months in clothing right now. I was only able to squeeze her into these a couple times. Wasted my money. These are definitely smaller than the 12month size advertised."
3,run small but are perfect for young babies,"Like all reviews say, these run small. A newborn is similar to a Preemie size, 0-3 is more like newborn and so on. I didn't know that and I went out and purchased a ton of the newborn onesies, luckily my daughter was VERY small... almost preemie sized so these were PERFECT for her. She wore the newborn size from Gerber for 8 weeks and then was FINALLY able to get into other brands of newborns.They are made well for young babies but if you have an active baby they wear down really fast, especially around the bottoms.So order a size larger than you would if you know what size you need and for a new mom, just skip the newborn size unless you know the baby will be smaller"
5,Best things are simple,"The best things are simple. these Switchit silicone utensils fit that bill. They will last forever as long as you don't throw them across a burner or something stupid like that... SO SO easy to clean... and light weight. I stopped using and replaced my old stir fry plastic wok utensil, and now use the long spatula and SO much easier and lightweight. No more arm fatigue. Also, no little plastic bits left behind in the pan. I also bought the 2 sided basting brush.. nice for basting, spreading oil in a pan...glazing...etc. I am replacing anything I can in my kitchen with silicone products... like I said.. easy to clean, and lightweight and lifetime. What more could you ask for? Little bit pricey, but I will never buy another spatula, baster, or spoon again."
5,Sandalwood cologne,"The only cologne I have ever used (for 35 years!). Given to me as a gift when I began shaving as a young man and loved by every woman who has smelled its fragrance. I can't stand most men's colognes, as they are either too complex or 'frilly.' This Sandalwood is very masculine and heady, without any musky smell. I have had both men and women ask me for the name of the great cologne I was wearing. My wife and I searched every Parfumerie in Paris for something similar, without success. NOTHING was nearly as good as Arden for Men Sandalwood. Hard to find, but worth every drop. Highly recommended."
1,had to return this.......,"I bought this looking for a subtile, sandalwood sent. What I received smells like sandalwood like cheap car air fresheners smell like pine. Cheap being the overall reaction, like a dollar store knock-off. Stinks and you will smell like you just put on a cologne that costs about $8......."
2,This is sandalwood?,Does not smell like sandalwood and is too overpowering. Would not recommend this product to anyone. Was very dissapointed in this product.
2,Not what I expected,"There was one particular song I wanted to hear and the CD only had the chorus of the song, not the verses."
3,No wiring diagram,"Although this is a good replacement when you get your factory harness cut, it does not provide a wiring diagram to match up the wire colors that come in this harness to the ones that are running in your car. It would be a 5 star if the company included this."
3,Not the origional Boneheads band from Maine,"Amazon has titled this cd ""by Boneheads"". The cd cover is by ""Bonehead"". I was searching for the origional band named ""Boneheads"" (Steve Jones, Bob Caswel...) who also have a cd ""Fade"". I purchased the cd and I was dissapointed by the misprint by Amazon."
5,Great album from the band that became Familiar 48.,"This is an excellent early album of Bonehead, now familiar 48. It contains an early version of ""the question"", Familiar 48's one semi radio hit, as well as an early version of waiting that is good as well. Just a great album to pick up if you can find it, or want to pay a good price for it. I got a deal on my copy, and recommend if you like familiar 48 to hunt down your own copy, well worth the effort."
5,Better than the original soundtrack,"Yes, I feel that this album done by Trio da Paz surpasses the original soundtrack to the movie Black Orpheus for two reasons. Firstly and most importantly, the original soundtrack is much more of a depiction of the movie on CD. The sounds of the movie are dubbed overtop the songs and the tracks change abruptly. This makes it abrasive to listen to and enjoy. Secondly, Trio da Paz is an incredible group and their expressions really capture the themes and intentions of Jobim and Bonfa. If you felt that Manh de Carnaval, the main theme to the movie, was haunting and evocative in its original form, you will greatly love and appreciate what has been done on this album. I've seen Trio da Paz live more than once, and each time they play they have copies of this album available for purchase and mention it sometime during a set on stage. They feel very strongly about their work here and that should say something about the emotion in this album."
2,Buy the original,"The original Black Orpheus that set the world on fire is available fro Verve. Why buy imitators when you can get the real thing? I highly recommend the original soundtrack. Though if you want to hear how influential that sound from 1959 still is today, this is an example."
2,only the terminally computer illiterate should get this,"The VAST majority of information found in this book isstuff that the semi-knowledgable Win3.1 user will be ableto figure out on his/her own in just a few hours. Good forfolks who just bought a computer, pre-loaded with Win95; butfor anyone else, don't waste your money."
5,Great for the Beginner,"I don't have Windows95 (pity on me), but my friend does. This book can guide me through"
3,"Good reference guide for us ""over 30"" who lived thru dos 3.3","After hearing all the horror stories about how confusing Windows 95 was, I was intimidated. This book guided me thru the transition and convinced me that I wouldn't break it! Like nearly all of the Dummie books, this explains in simple to understand plain English what all those buttons are for. A good addition to a home computer library"
1,Do not waste your money or time...,"The book begins with a solid and linear account of the actual history of the French language but unfortunately it lasts but for a few chapters. Thereafter the book turns into nonsensical propaganda to Quebec, the type of French spoken in that Canadian province and how wonderful all things Quebec are. The ensuing chapters go on endlessly as to how Quebec is holding the French language together, more so than France itself, against the power of English. Unfortunately most of the data and claims made by the authors are based on round logic, that is, conclusions basesd on ideas which are flawed or incorred to begin with. All in all this book can make for a good charcoal grill or fireplace starter. I am glad I bought it on sale for US$ 3.00."
2,Dry writing style,"This book covers the most fascinating topics- basically all of history that has anything to do with French language. On almost every page there was a topic that I had wanted to know more about for a long time. But it is written in such a dry style that it is hard to get through a page. It reads like a dissertation. Also, the authors seem somewhat biased and anti-English at times, which is not a good idea if you're writing a book in English. Get over it folks!"
4,A la bonne heure,"The authors of The Story of French are bilingual Canadian journalists who write intelligently and gracefully about how French has become a ""globalizing force,"" especially through the influence of the francophonie beyond France. Beginning with a summary of language history, Nadeau and Barlow discuss the origins of the French Academy and the normative French of Paris--and of myth--before moving to the reasons why French continues to flourish despite the growing clout of English. Although the book is about a hundred pages too long, there are engrossing segments throughout. For instance, how many Americans know that ten percent of Israelis speak French, or that there is influential francophone community of Lebanese in Senegal, or that at the time of the Revolution, a majority of Frenchmen were unable to speak or write French?"
2,Doesn't meet expectations,"Although I've tried several times, I've never been able to get through this book. It seems to lose focus as one goes along. One reviewer noted the incorrect Latin translation...I observe that the Conciergerie is not located on the Ile St. Louis (it's on the Ile de la Cité.) I have studied French, Spanish, German, Latin, and Greek, and I began this book with enthusiasm, wanting to grasp more of the history of French...but somehow the book just doesn't deliver--as though the editor was not up to the task of helping the authors structure their book and cut out extraneous material. Disappointing."
1,Waste of Money,"This was the single biggest waste of money I have ever expended on software. The graphics are poor and the information in the data base is both inaccurate and incomplete. Charging [money] should be considered a criminal activity. Do yourself a favor don't order this software. If you do, don't open it. This way you can return it."
1,not useful and crashes the palm,"What a waste of money! It only includes overview maps, not close-ups. It frequently crashes my palm 505. A previous reviewer reported this when using the direction finder, but mine even crashes when I just try to look at New Jersey (or perhaps that's commentary!). Restaurants listed are just fast food joints -- something I could see for myself at the various interstate exits included. This is just not a good product, especially for the high price."
2,a great idea but...,"I thought that the content would be better. Can't drill down far enough to see streets - just very major roads.This product is not going to be enough map for most -- you will need a real atlas, so what is the point?Save your money and buy the dictionary/thesaurus card."
2,Yuck!,"Bought it, thinking it would be basically helpful -- all I get are basics (passing through Harlem to get from CT to NJ? PUH-LEASE!) and bad info. I'll take my chances with Expedia, thank you.Nice try -- will try XMap next..."
1,No Detail,"No Street detail. Only zooms down to ""city detail"" showing only MAJOR roads. Very disappointing."
5,The best Teletubbies DVD we have,"We have 5 Teletubbies DVDs and this is the best one. We watch the favorite scenes instead of watching the whole DVD through because my son (16 mo.) likes the parts with just the Teletubbies the best (and he's terrified of the ""Magic Cloud"" so we have to be careful not to watch that part on the DVDs) and they are the best ones I've seen. A close second is the ""Ooh - Springtime.."" DVD. It also has a nice special feature clip."
2,Not the typical Teletubbies,"My daughter loves Teletubbies -- but this video is more like a Teletubbies music video than one of their typical shows. The characters dance in front of colored screens, pop on and off, and are very rarely in their little house or getting videos from kids. My daughter likes the structure of the typical show format -- with the baby in the sun, the characters interacting at home, etc. She lost interest immediately."
2,I hate the Teletubbies,"I myself really hate the dvd but I did not purchase it for me, but my 13 month old son wont watch it either. Maybe he is too young."
5,THE TOM COLLINS,The Tom Collins is an amazing Atlanta based rock group. Features Fran Capitinelli on lead guitar and vocals. very good stuff. see their latest album DEEP CUTS. www.thetomcollins.com
4,Excellent and a must read,Excellent book to start with. Altough it is not comprehensive and the exercises get you nothing more than started it covers all the basics well.
5,I hope this book continues to find a place on the bookshelf of musicians everywhere.,"Excellent source for any notation questions you may have. I took Mark's class at Berklee in about 1991. Great. ""A customer"" does Mark and his excellent book a disservice. I enjoyed your class Mark... you were tough but fair. The best kind of teacher.One thing that stuck in my head from your class had nothing to do with notation. You said words to the effect, that as students of music we should strive for greatness not only in music but in our relationships with others. Music may be of some comfort in our lives but it's our friends and family we all should remember to make time for. You cynical Sage... HA!Last I heard about you Mark you were in New Orleans (Saw the Globe article about musicians and health care in New Orleans). Hope your rockin' good n' strong wherever you may be.Peace, Harry Fix"
4,Ella's best from the 70s,"Recorded in 1974, this is Ella Fitzgerald's best recording from the 1970s. It's similar to ""Clap Hands Here Comes Charlie"" in featuring her in a strictly jazz setting, although one that is more noisy and rambunctious. Her accompaniment is among the best ever with Joe Pass, Harry ""Sweets"" Edison, Zoot Sims, Tommy Flanagan, Ray Brown and Louie Bellson. Ella scats up a storm on ""Rocking in Rhythm,"" and this version, in my view, is superior to the one found on the fabled ""Duke Ellington Songbook."" Another highlight is when Clark Terry joins Ella for a dual ""scatfest"" on ""I Can't Give You Anything But Love."" He darn near outdoes Ella!"
4,Perfect for those who love Madagscar,If you love the penguins of Madagascar you will love this DVD which is perfect for Halloween or anytime you need a good laugh.
2,Dumb!,It wasn't a halloween type movie like I thought it would be however the plot was ridiculous and quite lame.
5,THANK THE LORD,Thank you god...god created man then god pulled a prank and created woman...then after years of pain god gave us salvation and created midol....from all men of the universe thank you God for your mercy and praise be to midol!!!!!
5,Long lasting life,"Even though this battery seems a bit bulky, you definitely get up to 5x more battery life out of it, that of course depends on what applications you are running in the foreground as well as the background along with a screensaver."
3,"Reasonably Good, Dialogue and Characterization a Bit Stiff","Robinson moves an interesting plot along nicely. His descriptive abilities when it comes to action are solid. The enterprise suffers from wooden dialogue, stock characters, and an obviousness when dealing with spiritual issues. The author would benefit from trusting his readers more; if he did, his tendency to give labored explanations of faith might be tempered. Robinson has talent. His protagonist is likeable. His dramatic structure works. If he embraced subtlety where his instincts are to hit the reader over the head with a hammer, he could really be worth keeping an eye on."
1,Kindle Free Book,"Didn't get very far before abandoning this book. - Kindle E-Books should have a ""Contaminated by Religion"" Category.Others might enjoy it."
5,Great Read,"I am quickly becoming a fan of John Laurence Robinson. After reading his first book, Sock Monkey Blues, I couldn't wait to be captivated by another Joe Box mystery. I was not disappointed. UNTIL THE LAST DOG DIES is yet another treasure to be devoured by any mystery enthusiast. Mr. Robinson certainly has a gift for weaving interesting plots, creating larger than life characters, and blending reality with spirituality while maintaining a sense of humor.This is a smooth, fast paced read that never lets you down. The reader easily feels like part of each scene while maintaining a healthy distance, lurking in the dark shadows. There should be a reason to read a book. Mr. Robinson's hook is the human character he has created with Joe Box. Joe is the sarcastic, street-smart private eye that maintains his edge while showing a hint of his vulnerabilities. He is a loveable character indeed. Add the suspense and you have one outstanding read. Well done and highly recommended."
4,Intriguing,Great story with plenty of suspense. Really good chronicle of a new believer's walk with Christ. Excellent portrayal of how the occult can affect someone's life.
5,"It's an oil cap, not too complicated!","Well it fits just fine, stops the oil from leaking out the valve cover and was priced right. It's not the most complicated thing in the world so there's not much to say!"
1,WORST FEEDER EVER...DO NOT BUY!,"It looks great and even has a perch for the birds but it is horrible. If you have it PERFECTLY upright its ok but if there is a little breeze or any movement the nectar comes POURING out of the bottom tray which in turn causes ants on your deck which then causes ants in your house! I ended up buying a not so attractive feeder for $6 and I have never had so many hummingbirds at my feeders before.DON'T buy this feeder, get the cheaper ones that have little perches, well worth all the birds you'll get."
1,leaky mess,Overall the product looks very nice but it didn't work well. The sealant that keeps the nectar from leaking was not placed right so after you fill the cylinder with nectar it leaked all over the counter. I would not purchase this product if I could go back. Now I need to put more sealant in order for it to work properly. Thumbs down.
1,What A Disappointment!!,We recently built a new deck and planted many colorful flowers around it. It seemed like a good idea to buy a hummingbird feeder to attract the little hummers and to be able to enjoy watching them feed. Not with this feeder you won't. I'm so sorry we purchased it. It is shoddily designed and made...you cannot get the bottle fitted properly...it leaks onto the tray and then onto the ground. We have tried everything to correct the problem...unsuccessfully. A total loss of purchase price.
1,poorly constructed,This item is very shoddily constructed. Materials are cheap. Joints are fragile. Basin for nectar is unsealed and spills everywhere. What a mess. This is a terrible feeder.
4,"Pretty, poorly made","After the reviews of how this thing leaks, I decided to take a preemptive strike and seal it before I used it. This has worked, but it wasn't until after I sealed it that I realized the entire structure was bent."
1,Shameful,"Jamie Cullum should be ashamed of himself for trying to cover ""Lover, You Should've Come Over"". Absolutely horrifying."
1,"Crap, (...)!!!!!!!","Why do people fall for this? Don't they have ears!!!! This is not jazz, its not pop, it isn't anything at all. Its (...) marketed by one of the largest record companies in the world. Save your money. Buy Charlie Parker instead. Any Charlie Parker is better than this."
4,A good CD........,"Jamie Cullum's CD is a great set of funky jazz music. I honestly had never heard of him before a friend lent me a copy and I was amazed. This CD is wonderful! A wonderfully, fresh sound. If you like funky jazz you will love this CD...and even if you don't you may be like me and fall in love with this CD. I would recommend everyone check him out. If you don't like him don't buy him but I think may will be surprised as I was."
4,Skip in Connecticut,"1st off, I'm a musician so from a strictly musical standpoint I can tell you this guy is a real talent. I enjoy his playing & vocals. Puts lots of feel into songs, whether they are originals or creative remakes of others. I first heard a song of his playing on the stereo system in a coffee shop, and I just had to ask, ""who is that?"". I was surprised to find out it was someone this young. Jaime has a musical sophistication and appreciation of music well beyond his years. In a weird way, he kinda seems to me to be the piano version of Jason Mraz. Would love to hear those two do a gig together."
