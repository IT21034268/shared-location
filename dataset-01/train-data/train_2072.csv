5,still better than anything else,"This is a different book than the first two installments of the trilogy. It is much more concise and an easier read than the first two. Does this make it less of a book? On its own,this is still better than anything currently being published. It was an almost impossible task trying to combine the two main characters of each book and improve on them. It would be a shame not to read this book because it is different than the first two. I can't hope to read a better new book this year."
3,Not so realized,"Of the three novels that comprise Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy, Cities of the Plain is probably the least realized. McCarthy buries the plot in a wealth of details and sidetracks. The details are amazing, the sidetracks rich, but they distract from the overall thrust of the novel. When McCarthy gets back to the main action, there is the feeling that something vital has been lost. The sense of urgency between the two main characters has been all but submerged. Loose ends just don't tie together.Certainly, this novel should be read. As part of the trilogy, it is a necessary addition. The coda provides an end to the Billy Parham saga. But the book gets lost along the way. The reader just needs to hang on and trust McCarthy's skills as a storyteller to get us there."
3,"Great language, not necessarily great story","I read this final volume of the ""Border Trilogy"" because I had read the first two. I was massively disappointed with the plot. It is far more pessimistic and dark than the first two volumes, and can leave the reader depressed. Yes, indeed, the language is as outstanding as ever, and one can hear the authentic speech of people in the particular place and time, but personally, I found that to be another reason to find the plot depressing: the more you feel for the characters, the more you want them to come out of the story at least somewhat intact.All I can say without giving away too much is that those of us who feel compelled to finish this set of books need to get ready for a serious downer."
3,Happy endings are overrated.,"Of the trilogy, this is for certain the weakest. I did get a 'warm-fuzzy' seeing John Grady Cole and Billy Parham brought together for a proper closing. McCormac presents excitemen during a wild dog hunt, full of graphic intensity and perfectly paced. The dialogue was weak at certain points and the interwoven romance didn't captivate. Overall, well written, and full of quality prose; though, short on impact."
2,"(the second star is for McCarthy's guts, not his Vol. 3)","McCarthy's books mean more to me than almost any I've read--anywhere, ever. But praising a fatally flawed book does no one any good. Nor does guessing at the interplay of forces and pressures that occasioned its birth. It's a mess. I thank God for McCarthy in this world of literary lemmings. But not because of _Cities._"
2,What a disappointment from a great author.,"I'm sure part of the disappointment comes from the waiting, but the book really lacked in the signature Cormac vistas. There were a few intense images in the book, like the cowboy Billy meets at the end of the novel, but the book doesn't come close to The Crossing or All the Pretty Horses, or even his other books. The book was all dialog, more like a Hollywood screenplay than a Cormac McCarthy novel. Too bad. It could have been a great novel."
3,Buy only if you have the first two,"When I found out the two heroes of the first two books, John Grady Cole and Billy Parham, were united in this one, I went out of my mind to read it. Unfortunately this book is neither as exciting as ""All the Pretty Horses"" or as philosophically rich as ""The Crossing."" McCarthy's concentrating on the girl prostitute reveals his weakness in understanding a woman's viewpoint. ""Cities of the Plain"" works best in tandem with the first two books. Taking the trilogy as a whole, the necessity of this girl becomes clear, though that's up to the reader to pick up. The epilogue, which is really the epilogue for the whole trilogy, indicates the meaning of John Grady, of the women he loved -- and more importantly, the meaning of Billy. Get ""Cities of the Plain"" as the key to ""All the Pretty Horses"" and ""The Crossing""; read the other two first."
4,Cities of the Plain,"This is by far the most emotionally engaging and thrilling book out of the border trilogy. The way that Cormac McCarthy can incorporate comedy, love, hate, and suspense all together in this book always left me wanting to read more. The friendship between Billy and John always warmed my heart with their jokes and the way that they will always be there for one another. This book jumps from emotion to emotion and has a unforgettable ending that will forever stay in my heart. The life lessons in this story have changed some of my perspectives on life and have touched me in ways I can not describe. This was an excellent end to the trilogy that no one should go without experiencing."
4,"Disappointing, But Only By Comparison","This was the most anticipated book on my list for quite a while. I consider All The Pretty Horses to be perhaps the finest novel I've read, and The Crossing profound, if a little turgid. Cities of the Plain is also incredibly well written, and I'd still read McCarthy's next book before any other, but there's no new ground here, stylistically or emotionally. Unlike some of the commentators who've griped that the Trilogy books aren't particularly realistic portrayals of cowboy life, I never expected them to be, but there's something almost comical about a knife-fighting pimp expressing his philosophy of life -- as articulately as only Cormac McCarthy can -- as he slices up Our Hero, whose suicidal urge is a little hard to fathom even if we knew he was a romantic. The book is certainly worth reading, but I hope no one starts the Trilogy with it."
5,Omit epilogue,"I think the epilogue adds nothing to the novel, unless somehow I missed the point entirely. C. M. has elsewhere more skillfully put forth his theme that our destinies are predetermined practically from the ""big bang"" and that, appearances to the contrary, we really have no choices. The last thirty pages get to sound like a harangue.Besides, I would have welcomed a novel about Billy's later life. I love C. M.'s beautifully descriptive language, and the series is ending too quickly for my taste."
4,A Potent Finish to the Trilogy,"This is, individually, the weakest of the three novels in the Border Trilogy, but only because the others are so grand and masterful. The epilogue to the book, like The Crossing as an individual novel, is important to understanding McCarthy overall."
4,Plain and Rather Urbane,"My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"
5,Cities Of The Plain:Border Trilogy (3),"I loved it! I enjoyed the time period in which he set his characters. Very insightful and showing a different perspective of two cultures. I did have to re-read some--to understand the persons view of lifes twists and outlooks, but I would reccomend the trilogy and the author."
2,One of the worst books ever...,Did I read a different book than the other reviewers? 'Cities of the Plain' was absolutely terrible. I can't believe I managed to make it through the whole thing. I listened to it on cassette so I guess it must have been Brad Pitt's voice that kept me going...because it sure wasn't the writing. It was overly descriptive of background stuff that wasn't essential to the plot and that I didn't care about. The plot was flat and predictable. Don't waste your time or money!
5,A Correction,"Cormac McCarthy did not write ""The Unforgiven."" It was written by Alan LeMay in the 20s. LeMay also wrote ""The Searchers,"" and the screenplay for the classic Ford western of the same name (and the only flick in which you'll see a decidedly un-heroic John Wayne shoot a man in the back).Reports that McCarthy was influenced by LeMay remain unsubstantiated"
3,McCarthy Lite,"While I will be the first to admit a bad day reading McCarthy beats hell out of a good day reading anyone else, I couldn't shake the notion that the entire border trilogy has been watered down from McCarthy's best. For as much as I enjoyed this book, what it made want to do most was go back and reread Sutree or Blood Meridian."
5,Are all readers of Cormac McCarthy english professors?,"I enjoyed Cities of the Plains as much as the next person, but is it unfair to criticize the extensive use of Spanish without translation in key scenes of the book? Was the Epilogue really as wonderful as most reviewers seem to think? It left me wondering. I have anticipated this book for some time after the wonderful first two parts of this trilogy. Nobody writes of men and their dialogue as well as Cormac. No one writes with the skill of description scenes of the American West like Cormac. I'm a fan but apparently not sophisticated enough to fully appreciate this great writer."
3,Gripping,"The conclusion of Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy is a solemn and beautiful exploration on the erosion of the classical west. McCarthy's dialog is truly masterful and naturalistic-the swing of the interactions paints a remarkably vivid picture of friendship and trust. We are also fed typical McCarthy elements: horrendous violence, prostitution, dog fights, horses, and sun-baked malaise. I found that the guarded and impenetrable nature of the protagonist's stoicism made them even more intriguing, and the climactic sequence demonstrates an impressive ability to manipulate tension. Cities of the Plain is a very fine aesthetic accomplishment, even if the concluding sequence is overly self-conscious and postmodern."
4,McCarthy continues the excellence of the trilogy.,"Though perhaps not the equal of some of his previous works, Cities on the Plain is pure McCarthy. The wild dog chase and the knife fight are two of the strongest sections when the reader will watch with a morbid fascination as Billy and John Grady complete the third of the Border trilogy. McCarthy is the finest writer in the U.S. today and stands well with the finest of any generation."
5,Description vs. philosophical musings,"One quick thought after finishing this novel. As in the previous two books of the trilogy, this novel displays two of McCarthy's strengths: evocative description of man in the landscape and the musings of startlingly erudite, mysterious strangers (as in the epilogue). As for me, I'll take the landscape, e.g.: ""They were met upon a clay floodplain bereft of grass or any growing thing and the only sound the wind made was in their clothes. The dark clouds stood banked in a high wall to the north and a thin and soundless wire of lightning appeared there and quivered and vanished again. The rider leaned and spat and waited."" (page 231)"
3,Epilogue destroys otherwise beautiful contemporary westerrn,"There are many moments of simple beauty in this book. I liked that the two characters from the first two parts of the trilogy got together. I liked the ruminations on love and death. I thought the love story with the teen whore was sweetly played out. The ending was tragic and tearful. And the book should have stopped there. But, McCarthy has to go on for another 70(?) pages wherein one of the characters describes his journey to old age as well as a vivid, strange dream. I'm sure the whole thing is very deep and metaphorical, but it borders on the pretentious. This entire last part ruins an otherwise simple masterpiece. For better McCarty read Blood Meridian, Suttre, or Child of God. If someone can explain to me that epilogue, especially that dream, please do so."
3,Start Elsewhere,"sadly, ""Cities of the Plain"" disappoints in comparison with the first two volumes of the Border Trilogy. It is possible that I expected too much, but I think it is merely a less successful book. The story itself places Billy Parham and John Grady Cole, the protagonists in the previous books, together on a ranch in New Mexico in the 1940s. The setting has the same romantic feel of the other novels and there is good action throughout, but the story does not flow as well and it is less believable then the previous books. This edition relies on too many flashbacks, wasn't as well written and didn't add much to the series. I think it is important to read ""Cities of the Plain"" if you've read and enjoyed the rest of the trilogy, because the story really comes full circle here, but it is not a good starting point to become familiar with McCarthy. He has written much better material then this book and I hate to think of people thinking this is a good representation of his talent."
4,Campaign for Quotation Marks,"I join with others in heaping accolades of affection on this book, even if it was following the pattern of the two earlier books in the trilogy. Having lived in West Texas, I can attest to the brilliance of the author's description of the terrain and the cowboy occupants in it. JUST ONE COMPLAINT: I am hereby starting a nationwide campaign to collect money to help purchase quotation marks for McCarthy's typewriter (which I understand he still uses vs. wordprocessors.) Maybe even a comma or two. His dialogue is superb, but how much easier it would be to follow were he to use standard methods of presenting it. Maybe that's the point, that he wants to make it difficult to follow. If so, he succeeds. Nonetheless, great, though predictable, book."
2,I'm flying solo,"Well, I suppose I will be the one to stand against the stream on this one. McCarthy was a little disappointing in his third installment of the Border Trilogy. It was well written, but he fails in Cities much the way other writers fail in making their books much too predictable. All the Pretty Horses was excellent because you did not know where you would end. By the end of The Crossing McCarthy had started his characters down the path of destruction, and we knew it.By the way, do not become too enchanted with Cormac's descriptions of life as a southwestern cowpuncher. His verbal paintings of the geography are fantastic, but his understanding of the people are simplistic."
3,The third in the trilogy and the third in quality of work.,"McCarthy is great novelist, this just happens not to be one of his best. There were many points of brilliance and great humor in the book. Sadly, the epilogue was not one of them. It reduced me to wondering 'what the hell is this man trying to say' - to the point of starting to skip pages. The characters of Billy and John Grady would have been better cast as equal partners in the book. Having said that, I love reading Cormac McCarthy!"
4,It's about time,"After a lifetime of hearing traditional (ie, straight) popular love songs, how satisfying to hear some from a gay male viewpoint. It's about time. The very few previous recordings from a gay male perspective have tended towards the political, or even worse, the campy. (Although Michael Callan had some fine moments) Cam Clarke's interpretations are simple, understated, yet very sexy. ""Language of the Heart"" and ""Someone Else's Star"" stand out as two that consistently get a tap on the repeat button. Unfortunately, ""I Will Survive"" is such a gay cliche that even Cam can't make it work (hence 4 stars instead of 5). But yes, it's about time."
5,Cam does them better then the originals!,"I've been a fan of Cam longer then I can remember, so after following his voice acting career for so long it doesn't surprise me that he put out such a good CD. I honestly thought that he sung these, for the most part, better then the originals. Even though it's sung from a gay perspective, and that im not, he doesn't go over board with the gender's. I would defiantly recommend this CD, straight or gay, you defiantly wont be disappointed!"
5,This popular cartoon voice actor can sing very well!,"I've been a fan of Cam Clarke (a.k.a. Jimmy Flinders) ever since I heard his voice as Max Sterling and Lancer in the 1980s robot cartoon ""Robotech"". The Lancer character was a transvestite rock star (though straight) and actually sang several songs in the cartoon. (Yes, it was a groundbreaking cartoon!) He then went on to voice Leonardo in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" and a bunch of other cartoons and voiceovers for TV commercials. His speaking voice is great, and so is his singing voice. You can actually still get the Robotech soundtrack CD with several songs sung by him in a 1980's techno style, but his voice has improved a lot in this CD. I get a kick out of people's reactions to this CD and they wonder why I would be listening to it since I'm straight, but it's just a really great CD and I get to tell them about Robotech too. I hope he puts out more CDs."
2,I can only agree ...,"With the reviewer from April 6, 2004.This is exactly what this book is. A sort of guide to how the brain works, with some ""exercises"" thoughtlessly thrown in when the authors remembered that it's supossed to be a book on ""Building Mental Muscle.""I, too, am surprised at all the 5-star reviews. I wouldn't throw the book away, though; I'd say you can glean some pretty interesting information from it."
4,Flex the cortex,"Based around the six ""intelligence"" zones (social, memory, emotional, language, math & spatial) the book aims to present both background information and exercises for bulking up each of the relevant mental areas above.With ample information of the neurology of the brain, solid examples to support the information and some rather neat practice exercices, this is a solid example of a boox that does what it says it will.It's well worth a read and very recommended."
4,Read this if you are stressed or afraid of Alzheimers,"(Sorry about spelling etc,.. I'm from Norway. Age 44. Male. BsC.)This book was a interesting surprise to me. I thought I was going to read about psychology (I was right there), and that maybe it could give me a clue to improve my memory (It did).But what's really stuck in me after reading this book (I skipped all the exercises), is the relation between stress and deceases like alzheimers.If you want to have many years of good living ahead, the first half of this book is really worth while.Other parts (second half) are just stating what humanity knows this far about how hearing and vision works, and could be of interest to someone who have not read any psychology before, but the fact is, we still don't know how our brain works, so not practically useful for living a better life, like the first half was.I hope this was a alternative view to some of the other reviews :-)"
4,Entertaining Mental Exercises,"This book is entertaining. It contains a mix of puzzles, exercises, research studies and explanations. Also, the information on how the brain functions (how it can become more/less powerful) was exactly what I wanted to know. Other interesting points: how the Hippocampus routes and retrieves data; how stress interferes with memory and how exercise helps the retention of mental function. Probably my favorite parts are those that explain the underlying logic needed to work through and solve the exercises, like in the ""Familial Dilemma"" exercises.I give it four stars because some of the information and recommendations have been proven to be incorrect. For example, the book recommends that men take the supplement DHEA (for various benefits) BUT DHEA has been proven in medial studies to do more harm than good."
4,"Henckel 4"" embroidery scissors","I purchased the 4"" embroidery scissors to trim my bangs.When the package arrived, I was shipped mustache trimmers instead.They were the same price as the embroidery scissors.I awarded 4 points to the business who shipped these, for shipping me the wrong item.These trimmers work just as well as the embroidery scissors.Because they are Henckels, these scissors stand by the Henckels reputation.If they had been any other brand, I would have notified Amazon and returned them for the correct order."
5,Chou Chou Dress Deluxe Kit,"Another Santa gift for the little girls. I don't know if Mommy has had an opportunity to help them with this project yet, but I know they will enjoy it!"
4,my toys care,i think this toy is made for kids just to have fun making fun deluxe clothing for their chou chou doll aka dolls are pretend real for people who think thiese dolls are real.
5,KitchenArt 10002 Adjust-A-Rack,"This is a wonderful addition to my kitchen! I love being able to view my spices easily and being able to adjust the holders to the sizes of them. Just be sure to determine if the door will be able to close before applying them. Once they are on, they are on! I had to move items around in my cabinets for the best fit before applying."
2,Works wonderfully until you have to remove them,"I thought these adjustable spice racks were wonderful. I had a very small kitchen and using wall space for my spice rack was great. My spices were very convenient and they looked great. I got lots of compliments. Loved them until now. I have had these in place for almost 3 years and now moving. The tape works too well - Ripped chunks of the wall right off! Unfortunately I put up 2 sets of these so have quite a bit of wall damage to try to repair. I used my steamer to help dissolve the tape, but now there are some bubbles on the wall as well as a bit of removed wall and paint. What a nightmare! I will not buy these again and would not recommend them anymore."
2,"Read ""Strapless"" instead","There is very little known about the life of Virginie Gautreau and this author has managed to spin an entire book out of this paucity of facts. This is a light romance story at best, with pretensions of being an historical novel. This book edges close to a serial romance. If you are not enthralled with a lightweight romance, you are better off reading ""Strapless"". Same people, more factual."
2,What a disappointment!,"I love the artist. I love the painting. I love Belle Epoque Paris (and actually, Paris in general). I love good historical fiction. I hated this book! I looked forward to reading this more than anything in a long time, and am utterly disappointed. The stars I have given it go to what I believe to be Gioia Diliberto's talent as a researcher. As a writer of fiction, (once again, in my opinion alone) she is sorely lacking. The character of Virginie that Diliberto fashioned is so unbelievably self-absorbed as to be one-dimensional and her tale is told in clunky, graceless prose that I frankly found nearly unreadable. The cover is by far the best thing about this book. If that's what fascinates you about it, go find a book of Sargent's artwork. Whatever you imagine about the figures you see in his paintings will be far, far more rewarding than anything you glean from Diliberto's novel."
4,Gioia is a Joy!,I read Ms. Diliberto's article in The New York Times this weekend about the mystery behind the portrait of Virginie Gautreau and was instantly enthralled and had to buy the book! I read it in one sitting and was delighted by Ms. Diliberto's imaginings for the elusive Madame X and her life. I'm glad she turned her hand from biography to fiction! I Am Madame X is a fun romp in Belle Epoque Paris!
4,Tres Amusant,"For those not familiar with the French Language""Tres Amusent""(hope I spelled it right!) means Very Amusing which I thought that was a good way to describe this story about the beautiful woman behind the ""infamous"" Madame X portrait by Sargeant. I realize it was historical fiction and was glad that the author carefully explained it at the end of the book. Still,however,her ""Madame"" does emerge as a flesh & blood woman. Not always likeable,but very engaging and very much her own person. The descriptions of 19th century Paris are also vivid and realisitic. And the painter himself,J.S Seargant is depicted as eccentric but exacting in what he wants from his subject Finally, all that fuss over a painting which by todays standards is diginifed and evena bit chaste shows how far we've come since that time! If you liked ""Girl With The Pearl Earring"" you would probably enjoy this book as well..."
2,"Clever idea, poor execution","I have to give the author credit for the idea, but I found the book impossible to finish. The tone is unsophisticated and anachronistic, and the character never comes to life due to the lack of rich detail. Considering how little is known about the real woman, the author could have let her imagination run wild, but this effort is stilted and flat."
2,A disappointment,"The main character, Virginie Amelie Avegno, is underdeveloped. I lack empathy for this narcisist and hardly care what becomes of her.While I truly enjoy that bring a sliver of history to life, such as the ""Girl With A Pearl Earing"" and ""Vindication"" (two books I would strongly recommend over this), this book lacks the spark to generate my interest."
4,A GREAT CD... just missing a few songs,"Of the three ""Bye Bye Birdie"" CDs, this has to be the best one. It has a lot better sound quality than the Broadway version,and unlike the 1963 CD there are no annoying orchestra bits that have NO CORRELATION with the upcoming song. Most importantly, everyone can sing. As for the three new songs, ""Let's Settle Down,"" "" A Mother Doesn't Matter Anymore,"" and ""A Giant Step,"" I liked the a lot, espcially ""A Mother Dosn't Matter Anymore."" But the biggest thing that irked me about the CD was that it didn't have EVERY song from the movies such as ""What Did I Ever See In Her"" which I found quite funny, and that some that the girsl sang in the beginning in the sweet shop."
2,Unnecessary,"Why is there a soundtrack for this wistful movie and not one for Cinderella (1997)? It is a shame. Don't get me wrong though, the movie was all right and Vanessa did a great job but this soundtrack is so inconsequential."
5,"Durable, good value.","It's very light and very sturdy. It's easy to use them to pick up books off the upper shelf, and my grand parents love it."
5,The best,"This is the best. I use it constantly picking up kid's toys, but even better, my kids will use it to pick up their own things. They fight over using it! It kind of makes picking up a game. My mother, who is a neat freak, says she will go to the other side of the house to get it and then come back and pick things up, it's that cool. I love it! I would pay twice as much. In fact, I did, before my kids stepped on it and snapped it in half. This time I am buying two."
2,the bearable balance tips,"This one was weird..in the sense it doesnt know what to be. a hentai or plot of corrupt politics and shady pasts. Well neither goes in its favor. Half assed low budget animation is accompanied by bad music and voice overs. both light hearted and seriousness is the tone thats deployed...which people nowadays think thats a good idea in anime (in reality its creaters lack of scope and understanding of either). Plot suprisingly is almost work-man like and slightly better than usual for this kind of thing, although the sell is saying ""more plot,to acompany the sex"".It generally though never atemtps to find a happy balance, the drama and plot never take off, and the sex never explict enough. This anime isnt completely rapped around fan service or hentai autopilot,it just as a whole its bad, and at 60 minutes character development is silm to none, theres no vision or scope or even taste to recomend this flat liner. as if it were souly designed for the bargain bin"
1,Complaint,"This unit carries no identification is made &#8203;&#8203;by Victorinox, but behind that statement is made in alemanha.O know that Victorinox has the blade movement."
2,"Is this really a ""Victorinox""?","I bought this because it was cheap and it was made in Germany. But as the other reviewer said, it does not shows the ""Victorinox"" word anywhere on the peeler.It came on a small cheap normal plastic bag, with nothing printed on it either.So it makes me doubt if this is really a genuine Victorinox product."
4,Nice little collection,"All four of these films are well made and at least watchable, and I particularly liked ""Salvage"", which is quite an original film. ""Mortuary"" was pretty lame, but ""Memory"" was good and ""Bloody Mary"" might be worth watching just for the high T&A count."
2,Do not waste you money to buy this book,"Contrary to what the title suggest, this is not a ""handbook"". The book is composed from the loose articles written by approximately 30 authors. Every article written in different convention, different language, different approach.The book contains very limited amount of practical, ""handbook like"" information, charts, formulas, suggestions, etc. Some chapters are very superficial, the chapter 29, to name only one, ""Torque Control of Assembly"" completly misses the point. This is neither handbook nor academic textbook.I am dissapointed. I woudn't recomment this book to anybody."
1,no help at all,unless you are forced to buy this book i wouldn't do it. It's not going to help you out at all. If i could give it zero stars i would.
3,A Defense for Progressive Dispensationalism,"This is not your average 'bathroom reader'. Bateman puts together in 345 pages one of the best comparisons of the dispensational views on the three critical issues that there is contention over. He, however, is not unbiased in his presentation. He obviously favors the Progressive position. The Progressive view is flawed,however,in the core area of metheodology...hermeneutics. If the core is wrong then everything that attaches itself to it is also wrong. I would recommend this book for its thoroughness to any who have wrestled with these issues [as is currently going on] and one must come to a satisfactory position given the Biblical evidence."
5,A Keeper,"This is a book that may be the addendum to the classic, ""everything I know, I learned in Kindergarten."" A book of quotes or laws would have been boring , but the author includes such witty insights. ""PARKERS OBSERVATION. men seldom make passes / At girls who wear glasses. POGREBIN'S AMENDMENT. Boys don't make passes at female smartasses."" A book to treasure"
5,It's very nice,"It's another, really nice part in your braclet. So if you want to add something new in your braclet, get it."
1,Terrible and unorganized!!!,"This book should have been much better. I feel it gave no justice to the film it was supposed to support. Too many interviews which seemed to focus too much on these individuals histories than with the making of the film in question. Derek Taylor spends very little time discussing anything of interest of the making of the picture at all. At one point he seemed to talk more about his vacation to tunisia than actually reporting what was going on with the filming of Raiders!!! A terrible waste of time and highly unorganized!!! If ya want to see a great look at another making of book, take a look at Once upon a galaxy by Alan Arnold which chronicles the making of The Empire Strikes Back!!!"
4,Eddie Miller,"As usual, Eddie Miller, one of the finest mainstream tenor players, does some fine playing and as always, has a great tone.The trio does a great job throughout. I'm looking for more Eddie Miller records."
5,Use in My K-CUP!!,"I typically buy the K-cups in this flavor. I love to make starbuck-like lattes by adding half and half and sugar. Amazon went up on the price of the K-cups, so I decided to give this a try by using the My K-cup that came with my machine. It works WONDERFULLY!! I place 2 teabags in the My k-cup filter and brew normally. It makes for easy clean-up since this is bagged! If I want my latte a bit stronger, I will take the tea bags out of the filter after brewing and let them steep in my cup a little longer. So, now I figured out a way to get 60 K-cups (2 bags at a time) for just over 13 dollars (subscribe and save). LOVE IT!!"
5,Great stuff!,"Love the tea...love the deal...super for Keurig ""do it yourself"" lol. Nine more words are required so here they are!"
3,Spicy and tasty with cream.,"Celestial Seasonings has a nice chai spice mix. They combine ginger, cardamon, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, pepper and black tea. Spicy and tasty with cream.Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.Quote from the box:""Our deeds still travel with us from afar, and what we have been makes us what we are."" George Eliot."
5,My wife's favorite,My wife loves to relax in the evening with a great cup of chai. This product is her favorite and since it contains no calories she can add as much honey as she wants!
5,Tasty Tea,Im very happy with the purchases i have made... they all work for me and my family... thank you very much!
5,Wicked good tea,"Okay, I just got this tea last week. And what a pleasant surprise! My usual is Tazo, and I still love the tazo chai, and will go back and fourth with this brand and the other. But this one is so delicious with some honey and soy milk in it. And there is vanilla, but I really am confused why it's a bad thing? I think it taste super good! I guess if you hate things that taste awesome (I'm tricken; to each his own ;)But for serious.. I think the flavors blend very well. I look foreword to it every morning :)"
2,Warning for Long Time Drinkers of this Tea.....The taste has changed!,Just bought this for the second time for my mom who has been drinking this tea for awhile. The first subscribe and save shipment last year was great. This time around the taste of the tea has changed. For some reason the Celestial Seasonings has changed their 'recipe' and my mom did not like this as much as the old 'formula' and will not be ordering this again. This is a warning for other long-time drinkers of this tea.
1,Vanilla-y no good-y,"I agree with the reviewer that the vanilla flavor in this is very prominent. In fact, it pretty nearly wiped out any flavor of the ""Indian Spice"" that is in this tea. Barely a hint of the cardamom, cinnamon, black pepper and other flavors that are supposed to be in here. I have been drinking Chai for years and have never come across a single one that had vanilla. Now I know why. Stay away if you want a traditional Chai."
3,Eh - Vanilla,"I bought this in the vertical/foodservice packaging (where the bags are individually wrapped), which doesn't list the ingredients on the box. So, I was in for an unpleasant surprise to discover vanilla. It's a prominent flavor and one I don't care for in my teas.I typically drink my tea iced and without sweetener or cream, so it probably sticks out more than otherwise.On the other hand, I absolutely love their Sweet Coconut Thai Chai!"
5,Heaven in a cup!,"New Year's resolutions often include the hope to lose weight. Substituting this tea for late night snacking is one way to feel you are drinking a decadent cup of forbidden froth, while really sipping on very few calories. OK, I use half and half, which DOES add some calories - but it also adds the froth!! A little stevia powder(try the NOW brand - no additives, totally pure) to sweeten, and who needs brownies? One caveat - if you are very sensitive to caffeine, you may want to test your evening tolerance for this tea."
3,Novelty,This item is nice as a novelty for a themed event or dinner party. Not practical for use. They are top heavy and the fork and knife are useless. Very cute though.
5,WICKED AWSOME,EVERYONE SHOULD OWN SOME DIFFERENT WATCHES AND THIS IS AN INEXPENSIVE WAY TO HAVE A UNIQUE ONE/THREE. HARD TO SEE IF YOUR USING TI FOR ACTUALLY WORKOUT WITH OR RUN. THE LED DISPLAY IS A WEIRD REFLECTIVE COLOR THAT'S HARD TO SEE AT A GLANCE.
5,Great CD-Great artist-,"I have been an ardent fan of Mr. Schwartz's body of work ever since I performed in Pippin. From his haunting lyrics(Life Goes On)to his true to form-""So Far"" to the saddening ""Code of Silence"", Stephen captures the essence of human spirit. Great accomplishment! I only wish he would publish it in music form as I would love to sing some of these pieces."
3,Not the best book on ADHD,"This book is a very basic handbook. If you dont know anything about ADHD, it will be helpful, as it answers most of your questions. For more experienced ADHD parents, this book will not tell you anything you already know.I have some basic knowledge on ADHD, so this book didnt tell me anything new."
5,Help was needed,All the information I wanted and needed to know about ADHD is in here. I especially appreciate reading the quotes from other parents going thru what we're going thru and also appreciate the extra titles of other books based on a specific subjects pertaining to ADHD. This book has been extremely helpful.
3,NOT AS SHOWN,"I bough two of these, because of the nice looking fan, and because they were VIPER. What I got were cheep looking small fans, and noware to be found is the word viper. not happy."
2,Revisar el producto (Desde Venezuela),"Compre este producto confiando en la descripción y la imagen pero no me llego ninguno de los dos es decir me llego la caja pero cuando la abri la tarjeta no era la misma de la foto y menos de la descripción y para mala suerte me vino con algo desprendido, imaginense como uno se siente, se me hace dificil devolverla porque utilice doble envio para que me llegara a mi pais prefiero comprar otra a ver o que uds me ayudaran en este caso o me aseguraran que fue lo que paso por lo menos porque metieron otra tarjeta de video que no era, revisen el producto que estan vendiendo!"
2,"Not funny as ""A Good Man in Africa""","This one is more historical and heavier material than ""A Good Man in Africa"". It was harder to stick with, I might as well have read a non-fiction about the war in East Africa."
3,"OK, not great","I saw ""Armadillo"" on A&E and was fascinated throughout. When I went to the library, ""Armadillo"" was not available, so I got another book by William Boyd, ""An Ice-Cream War."" This book was a disappointment to me. I think the writing was superficial, it didn't seem to have a plot and I never could get into the story. People asked me what it was about, and I had a hard time telling them. I'm glad others were involved, captivated, engaged etc. but I was not."
4,economical well made,These chopsticks are square tapering down to round and un-lacquered. I like them because they aren't so slick that my food has to be prepared especially to suit my utensils. The tips are blunt cut which also helps with traction if you're a bit of a novice or just don't use chopsticks often. Economically priced because I can wash them or toss them if they're beyond washing after a meal.These chopsticks have survived my dishwasher a few times as well. Well made because the top shape helps me grip them (I have little feeling in my finger tips) and the tips are smooth enough that you don't fear splinters.
5,great deal,"These chopsticks are pretty good for the price. They are very long which I like because I have very big hands. They are thin overall, but thick enough on the ends so its pretty easy to grab things. They are squared, so the wont roll around in your hand, but are rounded at the bottom. I would say that they are like a fancy version of those chopstick you get with Chinese take-out. They are reusable of course, but they are cheap enough that you wont feel bad about throwing a pair away after several uses."
4,Good cheap chopsticks,"I needed some chopsticks as the ones I had gotten lost or damage. These seems fine although they do feel a little slick. People who may not use chop sticks alot might have problems picking up some food as the tips aren't squared, so it makes picking up food just that much harder.For the price and quantity, I cannot complain."
2,well...they're chopsticks,"good price for 10 wood chopsticks. I'm chinese - I use these daily. The red lettering washed off in one use - so that's the only downside. Otherwise, they do what they do."
5,Nice,"Very nice for throwaway price. What can you say about a chop stick? As always with things with chinese characters on them, I wish they would slip a note in there to tell you what the symbols mean. For all I know it could say: ""Best cat in town""."
3,ehhh..,"The red inscriptions came off when it came out of the dishwasher. The bamboo started stripping too. Its not horrible, but enough to be noticeable."
5,very authentic,I read the reviews before I got this and everything that people said is true. Very authentic and the so far the recipes are delish!
5,Authentic Ethnic Cookbook,This product was purchased as a gift to my boss who just so happens to be Greek.She indicated that the recipes are authentic to their ethnicity.She is enjoying it very much.
4,Just the tea I was looking for...,"Nothing like some warm dumplings, wonton soup, and a pot of this aromatic with fruity overtones tea. Yummy."
4,Delicious tea,I like loose leaf teas but this is really awesome Chinese tea for the price of less than $3. I found this in a world class shop rite and poured a cup after getting home. I was really surprised that it tasted so good. Follow the directions and be sure to brew it for only 3-4 minutes so that the oolong doesn't overpower the jasmine. It's great with sugar too and is perfect for cold brewing in the fridge in a sun tea jar.
3,railroad,"This is the history of the underground railroad as slaves crossed the Ohio River at Ripley, Ohio.It is interesting, but more details about the circumstances of the escapes and less listing of the names would have improved the story.Overall, it is very informative."
3,Beyond the River,"This is a fascinating piece of work about human endurance. It demonstrates that major events can occur in small places. I noted one lapse in historical accuracy. On page 68, discussing the early attendees at the Lane school, the author mentions one Henry B. Stanton ""...who would one day serve in Lincoln's Cabinet."" The only Stanton in Lincoln's Cabinet was Edwin M., who was the Secretary of War."
5,It's great for saving on international calls!!!! Uses similar/same technology as most phone cards!!,"I got this on a whim, because I was sick of buying calling cards with tons of restrictions and expiration dates. In fact, I found out that many phone card companies use the same internet telephony technology that Skype and other VoIP services utilize. Except using this device makes my life so much easier (not to mention less nerdy-looking.) I can carry my phone around the house, just talking like I normally would. I think this is an excellent product, especially for a free/extremely cheap alternative using the Skype service."
3,Sound quality could be better,"It works exactly as it is supposed to, but the sound quality is not that great. Initially, the sound quality for the people I was calling was awful (although I heard them fine, my voice was garbled to them). That was fixed by connecting the Internet Phone Wizard directly to my computers USB 2.0 port (as opposed to a hub or to a USB extension cable). However, even once I did that, I still hear a lot more interference than I do if I use a headset on my PC. The question is whether this product would work better on a newer, faster, PC. I doubt it, but you never know. I have a 4 or 5 yr old DELL Dimension 4400 running at 1.6GHz with 750 MBRam (WinXP).The sound quality is poor enough, that for calls under 10 minutes I find myself opting to use the PC headset for better quality. If I am going to be on the phone long distance for 30 minutes, I use this box so that I have the freedom to roam around the house on my cordless phone, even if the voice quality does suffer."
1,Very Unstable,"Be very careful to not unplug the device after you install. I do not know the reason, but once you installed it, the device it is linked to the specific USB port that you have plugged it the first time. If you unplugged and plugged in a different port things can go wrong. Actiontec acknowledes this in their website. The PROBLEM is that the solutions that they propose they did not work for me. Basically, I have tried reinstalling everything (Skype included) plugged it to the original USB port, but this thing does not want to work anymore.A good idea done by a lame company"
2,Doesn't work on Vista,"This product doesn't work on Vista and after contacting Actiontec regarding this issue not only they ignored my messages, but when I browsed over the net for help, there was only a couple of responses from them one year old at least. Although this product is excellent running on XP, the lack of support and incapacity to keep up with current operating systems is at least unacceptable. If you plan to ever update to Vista, don't spend your money on it."
2,Not up to replacing land line,I used the phone wizard with skype and my cordless home phone for several phone calls. A couple of calls went very well. Conversations were generally clear. But a couple of calls had interruptions in service and on two occasions part way thorugh a call I could hear the party I called but they could not hear me. I tried with and without a connection to my home phone line. The phone wizard worked most of the time but I wanted something to work every time so I returned it. I had previously used skype on the same computer with another product and did not have these problems.
3,Don't get if you're running Vista/Win7,This device worked great while I was using XP (no problems using using home cordless phone to place/receive skype calls) though it is a bit harder to setup than I think most people will want (I'm a tech guy) but the company never updated it's driver and this won't work with any of my computers now (all Mac or Win7).Anybody wants to buy mine ? :)
1,Get the revised edition...,"I love the Arkham Horror series, this was the first expansion I bought for it back in 2008. It didn't really integrate with the base game that well, and Fantasy Flight caught on and issued a revised edition that should integrate more...be sure to get that one and not this one."
3,Good headphones for a good price,"These aren't great, their base is a little overpowering and the trebile a little weak. But for the price, they are a fine pair or headphones. I would req for the iPod, which is what I use them for."
4,Great gift!,"As a gift for my sons truck, it was a big hit! He loves it! I would definitly consider other products from CoverCraft."
5,Straight out of the Headlines,"Barbara Bretton's books always tug at my heartstrings and ""A Soft Place to Fall"" is not an exception. The story of Annie Galloway and Sam Butler, the crux of the story is straight out of today's headlines and thus giving the book an extra umph.Although it is nowhere near being called a romantic suspense, Sam's predicament and Annie's past were constantly in the background that it played a major role in their relationship.This quote from the book sums the subplot with the romance as the main plot. ""Most people will show you their diaries before they'll show you their bank statements. Money is the last taboo in this country."""
5,A delighful story,"This is my first book by Ms Bretton and it was a very nice surprise. I loved the story and the characters are engaging. They are not perfect and this is what makes them so likable and they are not judgmental as in some books that when the h or H discovers the secret the other is keeping and they go nuts and almost destroy the relationship. The development flows in a natural manner and the characters have natural dialogs even if this remains a romance and evidently there are some elements out of reality but they are credible in the romance world. It was a very emotional story, sweet, romantic and it felt like being enveloped by a cozy blanket.I would like to know the story of some of the supporting characters like Hall. So I will be reading more books of this author."
4,a soft book to read,I read so much I get behind on my reviews. This one is not one of my favorites but very much worth the time to read. Hope you enjoy it.
3,A Soft Place to Fall...three and a half stars...,"The story of Annie and Sam shows how the wheel of life turns. Sometimes you're on top of the world and that there were times when you are at the bottom of the wheel and you get to feel all the bumps in the road called life.Love rule the world in this story of Annie sand Sam. , though I felt that there were points in the story where the author could have gone deeper Into details.The author has talent to make you feel the emotions in the story. the depth of love from Claudia and Warren; Sam and Annie.Overall it was an interesting read"
4,Book Description from back cover,"Once upon a time, Annie Galloway was a woman with boundless hopes-and big, glorious dreams. There were so many good days, when everything she wanted seemed just a heartbeat away-a career in art, a peaceful marriage, a house full of children. But there were dark times, too. And when her husband died young, her precious, cherished dreams died with him.Now, settling into a beachfront cottage in Shelter Rock Cove, Main, Annie has finally found the strength to start over again. All she needs is courage, and time. The last thing she needs is a handsome, charming next-door neighbor...Sam Butler has fled the high-stakes drama of Wall Street for the quiet charm of Shelter Rock Cove. Like Annie, he's no stranger to sorrow. But he's ready to show her that life does go on-one day, one dream at a time..."
3,Necktie Sampler Blocks (love to quilt),"This is an excellent book for sampler quilting in the traditional sense. I found it to have good instructions and illustrations that are easy to follow; however, if there are ties that are in fragile condition I don't recommend this book as one to follow. I do recommend this book to anyone who desires to cut up neckties for piece quilting."
4,Great Product,"This product works as it should, replaced old driver door switch. Significantly cheaper than what the mechanic wanted. Easy install!"
2,Quality control is needed.,"Delivery speed was great - However, when the bands arrived - they were 2 different sizes -- one is extremely tght and the other is fine. If i wasnt leaving on a trip in the morning I would return them."
2,not one size fits all,These will fit someone with a very small size wrist - which I have and they still got very tight and restrictive feeling...no way would they fit the average person...need to make that very clear on the description.
4,Groovey + Heavy = Bitchwax,"Spit Blood seems to be more of a B-side type album... but don't get me wrong, it still rocks. AB's first two cds are a little better than this one but if you're a fan you will not be dissapointed. I loved ""Black TransAM"". Bout time somebody writes songs about ""guy stuff"". These guys are amazing musicians and they show that off on all of their albums. If you're not familiar with this band, they are a 90% instrumental group with vocals here and there. The guitar work is just down right...well...ATOMIC. Read some other reviews for a more detailed description of their sound because most of them are right on the money. Even if you don't like this style of music, you had better admit that these guys are some of the best musicians around today. Just check out some of the solos on their first cd and you will know were I'm coming from. SABBATH LIVES ON!!!!!"
3,Bloody good.,"This disc is pretty sweet. It's just good simple metal/stoner-rock. It definitely reminds me of ""Kyuss"", and is mostly of the same quality. The cover of ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap"" is a good one, but that and ""Black Trans-Am"" are the only songs with vocals. The rest is just rockin' and groovin'. This is good stuff for a disc of extra's, so I assume their other albums rock as well. The bonus disc here is of other bands. Decent, but no big deal. Great cover art too, even though it's not shown here. Check this out if you're into ""Queens Of The Stoneage"", etc."
2,disappointed,"i bought this dvd because of the thing clay classics did with The Little Prince. i was expecting this to be in the same range of quality. eee!! wrong!first, the story is something i don't want my son to watch and understand. it made me feel really bad to watch it.but the claymation! omg, Pingu is better! it's been quite a while since i saw somethhing claymated so lousily (and ugly).2 stars cuz i usually leave open the possibility that i have just not ""understood"" what the artist wanted to express. hmm..."
5,buy them,"I am a backyard mechanic. Unbeatable price, excellent durability and perfect for me. Sears sells an identical set for twice as much. The only reasons I buy sears tools, around where I live theres about 3 stores within a 30 minute drive or less. They have a lifetime warranty and all i have to do is drive to replace it. I wouldnt worry about these guys ever breaking........just buy it"
4,Bargain & quality,"Needed to find a 17-mm allen to work on my Audi. This was a bargain compared to local pro tool shops. Solid construction, maybe not quite Pro-level but certainly great for home garage."
4,Hex bit sockets,Good value for the money for a hard to find item. Appears to be of good quality and has worked well.
4,Those are good sockets,Only complain is they dont stay in the holder very well. just flip them up side down and they will fall out.
5,Great Value,"I bought these to remove the transmission drain and fill plugs on an E36 BMW. These are cheaper and better than what I found on car parts websites. The bonus is getting the SAE hex sockets. The sockets are study and well built. They are long enough that you can use a regualr wrench in tight spaces. Some car parts store near me carry this socket set, but not at this price."
5,A Professional's Publication on Sustainable Solar Power,"This publication covers all aspects of renewable solar power in the U.S. It takes complex scientific and engineering concepts and brings them down to understandable practical knowledge that all professionals as well as the casual reader seeks.Any time a project team gets together on the design of renewable energy systems, they will need a common practical project oriented denominator from which to work from--and this is it. Even though the focus is on sustainable solar power, the book never forgets the other renewable energy sources that can be used for sustainable development."
5,Dr Peter Gevorkian's book on Sustainable Energy Systems in Architectural Design,"Thank you for the clearest, most concise, & easily understood treatment of a technology whose time has definitely come. Starting with a history & background of solar technology in its previous incarnations, we are quickly brought up to date with workable solutions to many of our current energy challenges. From homes to concert halls & public facilities, the ""how-to"" of putting these technologies to work is fully explained in crisp paragraphs & bullet items, punctuated by colorful graphs, schematics, photos & charts which clearly illustrate the concepts explained. Examples of successful projects are provided & strategies presented to transition into use of solar power & other forms of renewable energy. When you finish reading this book, I'm sure you will feel as I did that you have a genuine understanding of what technologies are available & how they can work"
5,Annabelle Redeemed !,"I didn't think it could be done ,really this was one character we all truly loved to hate and I for one was NOT looking forward to having any sympathy for her...And I knew I would.. because Ms.Layton draws the reader into these things.So I bought the book and let it set for a few days pondering. I didn't want to like it.But I love Ms. Laytons style of writing so I convinced myself that was why I was going to read it,not about Annabelle!!I won't really describe the tale told cuz I hate it when some one spoils the story for me ,I will say to all the fans of this great author that this is well worth reading and just as endearing as her other storys have been."
3,Mixed Feelings,"For a nonspecialist new to Napoleon, the information Andrews collects here is great to have all in one place, but I wish Andrews had omitted the personal judgments he offers. They show signs, especially given the fame of his subjects, of not having spent the time it takes to better understand personalities, human nature, political office, British manners, etc. Did Andrews use one of Philip Guedalla's better-known mots without giving him credit, or is ""History repeats itself, historians repeat each other"" so popular in British journalist/historians/ circles that it needs no attribution? I read the entire book veering between appreciation for the work Andrews did bringing his material together and annoyance at his comments."
4,Surprisingly Compelling,"This book was a surprise for me. I picked it up at the library, intending to just read a couple of pages. The next thing I knew, I was 82 pages into the book. It's written well and avoids some of the dryness of other books about these 2 men. Rather than recounting the battles fought by these notorious commanders, the book focuses on the relationship between the two men that led up to the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo. It does assume that you have some historical background and that you know the basics of what happened at Waterloo and the subsequent exile of Napoleon. The angle of this book is different and refreshingly alive."
1,Faulty package of tests---NOT sensitive at all,"I ordered these thinking it would pick up a pregnancy like it says they will. Considering it's a PREGNANCY TEST it should right?...NOT. Not only was practically every test permanently indented (several marks/indents across the white test area PRIOR to using them), but when I used them the dye refused to run all the way across the test. I'd leave them out flat for 10 mins and same thing. An hour. Two. I found out I was pregnant instantly with Clearblue, Answer, and First Response, and these tests STILL didn't have anything on them. If I ever order cheap tests again I'll get them elsewhere. Waste of money!"
3,The Sexiest Woman Alive,"Karen McDougal is the sexiest woman alive. The video is tame but Karen isn't. She smiles at you, you melt. She winks at you, you melt. Spend two hours with this video and wake up with a smile on your face."
3,Just to see someone as REAL as Karen McDougal is worth it!!,"It is an ordinary video except for Karen. She is a class act and drop dead gorgeous too. If you're going to by one of these ""art"" videos, make sure it has atleast 5 minutes of Karen McDougal in it. I very rarely view Playboy, but I definatly made an exception in this case. I just hope my wife doesn't look in my dresser."
3,Decent,"Not too exciting. I liked her better in the ""Girls Next Door"" Video. Very creative scenes, but the really artsy stuff like that wasn't exactly what I was looking forward to seeing!"
1,"All the models are air brushed so they look ""perfect"".","What I would like to see is real women, not models that are air brushed, and all the minor imperfections that make her what she is, taken out. END"
2,Playboy video once does it again,"Karen Mcdougal is just gorgeous in this video. The problem here is the way in which Playboy showcases this lovely lady's attributes; that is in an all too typical ""make love to the camera MTV video fashion.""What I would love to see is a playmate in a more natural setting, not alone, but not making out with a chippendale's look alike.I would love to see her getting naked and jumping into a public fountain as dazed onlookers watch in amazement. Playboy and voyeurism go hand in hand, and it would be great if thier videos depicted more of it. That is, if they showed the playmates casually undressing in front of other people."
5,Beautiful face and great body,Karen is gorgeous. If you saw and enjoyed her layouts in the magazine you won't want to miss this. We see Karen making love in two shots as well as some explicit slit shots we'd never see in the magazine. You'll want to skip the interviews with her mother and I suggest dropping Hugh a thank you note for leaving her clothes on.
2,A disappointment,"If you want to read about Saudi Arabia, then this book is not for you. It is a story about an Englishwoman who goes to S.A.to make a living as a governess. It is not especially intersting or well written, sadly lacking in descriptions of both the country and the palace.Don't expect another ""Priness""!!"
2,Disappointing,"While this book is an interesting story, and provides a good look into a fascinating culture, it is not well written. The writing is hard to read, doesn't always make sense and is very choppy. It is also i little hard to follow at times because the paragraphs jump all over the place. Considering the unusual opportunity the author had, this could have been a fascinating book, but unfortunatley the mechanics bring it down and make it rather irritating to read. Also the author seems to be a little confused regarding some facts about Islam."
3,A litttle too stilted,"As a single woman who also worked in Saudi Arabia, I found her book a little too stiff, but then I realize she was living within the confines of a royal family compound and not out in the general public often. For a lighthearted intimate view of Saudi Arabia from an enlightened single American womans perspective, I also recommend 'SINGLE IN SAUDI' by GENIA."
1,Not worth the money,"In my opinion, this game is badly designed. Atari have put no effort into this. There are too many ""glitches."" I don't know how a previous reviewer can state that he has ""yet to see any repeated categories or answers."" My husband and I encounter repeated categories/answers every time we play, which is definitely getting less frequent!Another problem is a question being judged ""incorrect"" when it is obviously correct. This happens nearly every game.The game is worth about $10.Sorry, Alex."
3,Fun but frustrating,"The kinks definitely need to be worked out of this game. The concept and graphics are top-notch, but there are some very frustrating aspects to it. The ""judging"" programming needs help, since several of my answers were correct, yet were ruled incorrect, for reasons which were not always clear. Players must be spot-on with their spelling of words, due to the fact that the computer judge is extremely literal (e.g. ""first star"" was not allowed for the answer to ""Twinkle, twinkle."" ""Star"" was the correct answer). Also, the spelling prompt at the bottom of the screen actually allows for unintentional ""cheating"", if you will. That is, I had intended to type in the answer ""Sheldon,"" when actually I meant ""Shelley."" Once I saw Shelley on the prompt screen, I buzzed in with it. I have no doubt version 2 will be far better, but until then..."
3,"Fun, if you know the answers.","I like this game. the graphics aren't that great but it doesn't limit the fun factor. There is a cool function when you start to input the answers, the computer automaticlly finishes the answer for you. My girlfriend doesn't like it so much because she doesnt know a lot of the answers. I like it, I guess because I know a lot of the answers. Don't tell her I said that!!"
4,Good Family Fun,"The only thing that I can say negatively about this game is Alex Trebec. All his small ""cameo"" appearances are annoying, and it is nice that you can hit the ""start"" button to skip them. Also, the computer only seems to answer the top dollar questions, but all in all, a great game."
3,not the real thing,"This game is alright. The first thing that really annoyed me was the fact when you play one player it doesnt give you the answer to the question even if you are wrong. In addition, the computer gives voice recognized answers and you have to type your answers and you have to be exact even if you've changed it in options. Another thing that really irritated me was the fact that the buzzers are retarded."
3,just like the show,youll do about as good here as on the show.that is until you get the same old questions over and over again.theres a part where you and the others compete for the right to answer first.thats a pain in the butt.the other thing that stinks is that they make you spell everything right.there is a loose spelling option butits useless.
1,Is this book bogus?,"This book recieved initial kudos, including fascinating article in the New York Times. I bought it for my father, a civil war buff, for Christmas. He believes that the 'diary' of this Civil War Private has been fabricated. He notes that the author found his way to the front lines of every important battle of the war and worked on water colors as cannon sounded around him. He managed to meet every important General in the war. He carried drawings and paints through a war when most soldiers couldn't carry basic provisions. He also used language inappropriate to the age, like worrying about 'a virus'. My father notes that he had not heard the word 'virus' as a child in 1930. We would be interested in hearing the opinions of Civil War scholars as to the authenticity of this work."
5,unforgettable reading,"i read this book some years ago but for me it was an unforgettable read,he mentions ambulances hurtling along full of wounded men in agony and blood running out of the bottom of these wagons and dead officers boxed up in coffins in the main hall of savage house waiting transport home for burial,he also was incarcerated at andersonsville,it is a great read and it is also dotted with sneddons own art work and maps,robert knox sneddon caught the civil war in art and map form but he also describes it with the detailed eye of an artist,it is packed with the minutae of happenings during the civil war,dont miss out get this book."
4,Regarding authenticity,"Sneden's memoir and watercolors comprise a remarkable document of a soldier's life in the Union army. A previous reviewer questioned the collection's authenticity for a number of reasons that I didn't find accurate. Sneden's memoir does not indicate that he was at every major battle of the war, nor that he met every major general. He was a cartographer in the Peninsular Campaign, and thus was in contact with the generals (who naturally had an interest in maps) at those battles. Likewise, his role as a mapmaker would explain his access to materials, though as the preface indicates, Sneden probably quickly sketched most of his battle scenes and colored them in later. As for the the word ""virus,"" the OED indicates that it was used as early as 1728 to refer to disease contagion."
4,New glasses,Eye of the Storm is a rare opportunity to see a new yet original view of camp and prison life. You will find yourself drawn to Sneden's original illustrations time and time again. The more you study them the more you see. It makes you want to see more and larger versions of his drawings. Brayn and Lankford have done a good job in not tainting Sneden's work while at the same time pointing out some important historical questions. I marked over twenty parts to use in reference and speeches.
5,This Movie Brings you back to 1865,I thought the special effects were excellent. It made you feel like you were walking besides Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes-Booth in 1865. Highly recommended for Civil War Buffs and the those with a general interest alike. When's this one Coming outon DVD?
2,Confusion,"My thoughts during this film was first to long in respect to the title, it seemed to ramble leaning tward the end of the civil war,i am still dont see the significance of that short sex scene to the day lincon was shot."
5,A refreshing Film,"Take a chance on this well made film that is simply enjoyable to watch. Rob Morrow in particular is amazing and you can't afford to miss watching this film. All TV films should be as good. Also take the time to see Rough Riders, Truman, and Conspiracy."
5,Great,"Great service, great product. I love Lincoln history and this cd was wonderful! Buy it if you like anything Lincoln!"
4,"If you want to know more about Lincoln's death, get this!",This movie showed what might have actually happened the day Lincoln was shot. I love President Lincoln and this movie helped me understand his death more than I ever have before!
5,Great Buy,I was pleasantly surprised when i actually saw the Grill Pan the size and the weight are amazing for the price.Pan sticks a bit initially but with prolong use it works very well.I live in Barbados and one of those pans that size would probaly cost around $120.00U.S.Iwould recommend this to anyone wanting a good pan.
1,Wham! What a piece of junk!,"Despite the name, this pan is a very heavy piece of junk. On first use it cracked! I'd give it zero stars if the thing weren't so heavy. Unbelievable! The side CRACKED!"
1,rusty,"My thinking behind buying this Grill Pan was that it MUST be good if endorsed by Emril.....i was wrong. After the first wash...not even the first use....it rusted!!!! No abrasive cleaning agent was used...i was mortified! So i googled how to ""season"" a cast iron pan...tried the coke thing and to no avail. Not even bothering to return it as i reside outside of the USA and the shipping duty heavily outweighs the initial cost. Thinking that the best place for this now rusty grill pan would be in the dustbin. Not impressed AT ALL!!!"
4,Good Pan,"We bought this mainly to grill chicken breasts and steak during the winter. So far, have only used it on chicken. Holds more than you would think. I made sure to season it first, but of course it doesn't clean as easy as a Teflon coated pan. Well made. Price was reasonable."
5,works great,"works great, I love this pan easy clean up. I have one for the kitchen and one for the bbq. excellent product. I will be looking for a flat surfaced one next for fried potato's."
2,Have seasoned this numerous times everything still sticks,Everytime I use this I practically have to scour it clean and start over again. Everything sticks to this pan no matter how much/little seasoning or oil/grease I use.
1,Crumbled to pieces,"I never actually used this product. When it arrived, to my utter dismay, one whole side of the pan had cracked off and lay at the bottom of the shipping container. The break was more reminiscent of an item made of porcelain than iron. I didn't think it was even possible for a cast iron pan to shatter in such a manner. Low and behold, I found out this sad fact hard way. Additionally, the item's surface felt chintzier than expected. Maybe I should have invested the few extra dollars and bought a higher quality item. I'm sorry Emeril, but the only ""BAM!"" associated with this product comes from the cacophonous sound of me dropping the heavily travel-worn beast of a shipping box onto the desk of the local post office."
1,BEWARE!,"BEWARE! somehow it has been crossed over that this contains the 1976 film ""gang wars"" AKA ""devil's express"".I purchased this title with the same name and even the same UPC code from ebay which shows the same cover art, but with the Blaxploitation art in place of the incredibly bad, unnecessarily violent towards animals movie that this actually contains.HUGE disappointment."
3,Good text book for Survey of game art,"I could not help feeling that Todd intended this book to be used in the classroom. It is organized very well for a semester in ""Game Art"". The reader has a chance to do some basic texturing and modeling. The emphasis is on 3d Max 6 and no animation is covered. Personally, I wished less modeling was covered and more visual art and texturing was covered instead. Also, more character texturing. There is a character that you model at the end of the book, but it is just a robot-type without a face and no texturing is involved. However, it is difficult to cover so many topics in one text. You will also find that some of the web links to tools he used for texturing are out of date and broken. If you have the latest Max tools, these tools may not be compatible anyway. In summary, a good text but more on texturing and character texturing would have made it an excellent choice."
1,Amateurish and not worth it,"If you're thinking of getting into the video game business as a modeler or texture artist, don't waste your money with this book. The cover should tell you all you can expect from this book: pathetic modeling with poor texturing. This is just someone's attempt to cash in on the wave of video game education, without actually having enough talent or experience required in today's video game workforce."
1,Very sad looking indeed,"We purchased this for my daughter for Easter. She wanted a string puppet. She seems to enjoy it, but it looks like an emaciated dog and not very cute at all. I would have chosen a different puppet if I had to do over. Definitely not at all what the picture implies. We even used the blow drier on it to try to fluff him up a bit. My son wanted the camel, which is very adorable and very highly recommended over the sheep dog."
1,Disappointing,Needed this as a Christmas present. My grandson loves dogs but this looks like a drowned river rat. One cannot just fluff up the hair to make it look presentable.
2,Sheepdog puppet,My 10 year old ordered this - when it came the strings were all twisted and it was a puzzle that we could not undo. She didn't use it at all - very disappointing.
5,good value,My son has wanted a marionette for a long time. This marionette is durable and not easily tangled. Which is a wonderful thing. He was able to learn how to use his marionette very easily.
2,Smaller than expected,"My grandson was pleased with the toy, but it was flimsier than I expected.If I had seen it at a store, I probably would not have bought it."
3,Très bons dvds... mais...,"J'ai acheté les 4 dvds qui sont excellents. Mais franchement, un seul dvd regroupant les 4 sujets aurait très bien fait l'affaire. Au total, la durée des exercices est de 48 minutes, le temps d'un seul dvd. À l'unité, les dvds se vendent aux alentours de 13,40$ X 4 = 52$+ les frais d'envoi = beaucoup trop chers. Pensez-y avant de faire la mme erreur que moi."
3,Fair product,The product is great with the exception of the cheap plastic clasps on the straps. I purchased a number of these and one broke almost right out of the bag. Very disappointing. Unfortunately we already had the item monogrammed so returning was not an option. The bag is heavy duty and well constructed other than that.
2,Not layed out well,"Lots of words, but not to crazy about the pictures. Each page has one large picture or scene and the images are somewhat overlapping and hard to distinguish. Then down the side of the page, there are the dictionary words describing what is in the scene. Then, next to each word is a smaller isolated image of the item/person/action that is in the bigger scene picture. But the images are so small that it is hard at times to distinguish what they are. For example a picture of a knight, has the shape of a person, but it is hard to see the details of what makes the image a knight. This book is not really fun to look at and causes some confusion and each page is a bit overwhelming."
3,Lets Learn Italian Picture Dictionary,I bought this to read to young children and I thought it was way too advanced and way too much information for a child to digest
4,Vampires as the should be,"Anything done by white-wolf publishing is an amazing foray into the darkest parts of the human mind. They tell stories, not just write books. (there is a difference) and it is a unique spin on the traditional tales of Vampires. If you think you know Vampires...think again. Foget evreything you know."
5,Savannah grace; LA cutting edge; Nashville understanding,"Jim's record resonates with a passion sorely missing in today's musical malestrom. From heartfelt passion in ""Angel of Mercy"" to age old human ansgt in ""Jealous man"", only to lay it wide open in ""Savannah"", Jimmy G. knows from where he comes, and to where he's going; a proverbial 'Happy Gilmore' of blues...Whether it's wailing on his vintage Stratocaster, or flailing his Calloway Warbird, you will never cease to be amazed...Buy the record. Love him as we do."
5,cooler than the other side of the pillow,"well writen songs, flawlessly executed without losing a drop of soul. One of the best lines ever written...""the wind that set you free blew me out to sea."" Man, I wish I'd written that.....A true Fan in Tennessee."
5,Three Plums in One,No one can make you laugh like Janet Evanovich! What a hoot! Love her Plum novels...
1,Three Plums in One - Boxed set,"OK, I love the Stephanie Plum series. Really & truely. This boxed set, I did not care for. What I didn't like was the person reading the audio book cd's. All the characters sound the same and there are many parts not included. Be smart and buy the books or get the unabridged cd's or tapes. I was very disappointed."
4,Praise for Lori Petty,"Other reviews have done a great job analyzing the content of these delightful little books, but I was introduced to Stephanie Plum on CD during a road trip (that went through Jersey, which made the books that much better). I have to attract attention to Lori Petty's fantastic reading. Her hooker voice made me laugh over and over, and she does a great job of developing distinctive voices for all the other characters as well. The tone is perfect, she's totally clear on every word, and she really does add another level of enjoyment to the experience of listening to these books on CD."
3,three plums in one,If you want the gist of the books these are the way to go considering they are an ABRIDGED copy. The reader Lori Petty does an alright job. unfourtnaly I would recommend the unabridged read by either C.J Critt or Lorelei King they do a supuerb job where Petty is lacking
5,The first three rolled into one fabulous book,"I love this series. The best part about this series is that it is the first three books in her series. It is a three for the price of one deal. I love the characters and the story line. From Underwear buyer to bounty hunter she is a believable and loveable goofball who is constantly having her cars blown up by bad guys, repossessed by creditors, or stolen by the men she is hunting. It is fast paced and funny. A great read regardless when you can find the time to read it. Love Evanovich and her Stephanie Plum series is my personal favorite. The stories are well written, very colorful and always bring a smile to my face even on the worst of day. I highly recommend them for light reading you don't have to take to seriously. They are my personal escape on those days you just cannot face the world."
2,Stephanie Plum Novels,Stories are fun and a nice trip from stress but if you are looking for the enjoyment that you are used to when Lorelei King reads the books you will be sadly mistaken. I purchased the audio thinking that Lorelei King always read the Plum novels and I was so disappointed. The reader of the book should always be on the sales page.
1,Are you serious$20 for one notebook,Ok I have heard of expensive notebooks but this is just outrageous $20 for one notebook. Are the sheets made of gold. I hope no one seriously buys this crap.
4,Some very useful advice,"Ms. Orman has written a very practical and useful book -- particularly laws 1 through four. Her old paradigm -- look inside to find out why you are not managing money as well as you could and the idea that people need to feel empowered when dealing with money -- are present here, as well as in her 9 Steps to Financial Freedom. What this book adds are some very useful pieces of advice on how to organize your priorities in deling with debt, saving for emergencies, preparation for home- and car- buyers. If you are bored or dislike Ms. Orman's philosophical and feel-good diversions, you can skip them altogether, but the book offers very practical advice (and has a workbook at the end to boot)."
4,I love the laws of money,"Hello: I'm an avid reader of all sorts of books. I love mystery, true crime, novels, and anything political. This book was the second Suze book I have read. It seems simple at first and then when I tried to actually apply these principals to my own life I could see just how valuable they are. Suze has, in my opinion, created these laws from her extensive practical experience of advising thousands of people over the years. So many of my friends borrowed money from their home equity to buy stock. When Suze says invest in the known before the unknown this one law could have saved one of them from losing their home. I think this book is great and truly enjoyed reading it although it was not from one of my regular genres."
1,Poor printing quality,The book shipped to me was printed in poor condition. It's like a scanned copy of the original then being printed on a low resolution printer. It will definitely harm your eyesight if you read it.I returned it immediately and borrowed a good copy from a library.
1,Typical Suze Orman fluff,More fluff than substance. Only in America can you make money marketing yourself selling common sense as 'advice'.No wonder she makes more money from marketing than providing advice one on one.
1,Skip this rehash- buy her older book,This is a poor and inferior rehash of everything she said before in a better way. Some marketer must have thought she needed another book. Don't waste your money on this poorly written sequel. Buy Suze's older book.
1,She is on CNBC with Cramer - isn't that bad enough?,I read one of her books at the library and was not impressed. I skimmed through this one at Borders and it was more of the same. She reminds me of that Susan Powder (sp?) woman with the short hair who was an exercise guru. What ever happened to her?There are more than a few really bright women in finance. Suze and Maria Bartoromo are not among them.
1,Predictable pap.,"This is useful only for the functionally illiterate, for those who have no knowledge whatever of the use of money, of investing. For others it is a total waste of money."
4,Pretty Much Common Sense,"Essentially all the laws of money in this book revolve around one central idea - be true to yourself and express the truth about yourself through the way you handle finances - in short - don't spend more than you can afford to spend; stay within your budget instead of blowing money you don't have and with the money that you do have, do as you please, or rather, use it in a way that is meaningful to you, and plan your financial future accordingly."
3,Never Changes.,"Same presentations as all of her other books. If youhave one, you have them all. This is how Suzie isgetting rich, selling books. One is enough, so don'tget more than one."
5,The Best Advice I've Ever Been Given By A Financial Expert,"This book is seriously a must-have for anyone with questions about finance and how it relates to happiness and your overall well-being. I now know how to and how not to invest. I know what to do with my student loans and, because of Suze, I am now looking forward to a secure financial future and never looking back.If anyone is thinking of investing, INVEST IN THIS BOOK!!!"
5,Great Book!,"This book is really good. It educates you on how to manage your money, the proper ways of investing,etc. It also shares great personal stories of individuals, that can reflect somehow to your life, or prevent you from doing the same thing. Suze Orman is one of the greatest Financial Advisors! I recommend her books to anyone who needs to learn how to take control of their life, and money!"
5,Excellent trimmer,"I have had this trimmer for several years & love it. It is so easy to use & very well designed. I use the straight blade & the scoring blade. It is very simple to change the blades. The blades last a long time & I have not yet replaced the mat. I use it to cut card stock & file folders, plus occasional paper projects. The 15 inch opening is essential for my projects. This trimmer is very affordable & impressive quality."
3,works and cheap..,"This product is inexpensive and does the basic job its intended. if you are a weekend mechanic on older vehicles it works fine. Nothing fancy, just works."
4,Old code finder,I got this item because my aunts car if older than the new ones. So i was able to get the older code from this unit and fix her problem.. thank you
5,Equus 3123 code reader,"The code reader was cheap and easy to use, allowed me to read the codes on my vehicle easily. Done what I wanted."
2,NLVSkydiver,"Should be named ""All GM Except Cadillac"". It seems that most Cadillac models of the era have an internal code reading method built in, so this item is not necessary."
3,A Cop Killer and A Killer Cop,"The plot of the movie is contained in the title of this review. There is a lot of action in this movie, that is for sure. We have a typical 'hero and a villain' story.The story takes place in London, so it was little hard to understand the characters, but we put the subtitles on, which helped a lot. The hero in this movie was not a likeable character. He harasses people around him, and is obnoxious most of the movie. In fact, the villain becomes a cop killer because he was beaten badly by the hero of the movie in the past.Soo, this is an OK movie to watch. I liked 'The Mechanic' by Jason Statham much better."
1,Blitz Was A Bust,Movie story dragged and did not take any real time to develop the characters. The show reminded me of watching a CSI episode at best. If you are counting on any Jason Statham fight seens I recommend you do not bother watching this one since there are really none based on his previous movies.
1,Possibly the worst movie ever - Not an Action movie,"I like action flicks. I like Jason Statham.This was not an action movie. The first 2 minutes of the movie had more action than the next hour and a half.This movie was filled with pointless sub plots. The movie didn't make sense. You kept thinking, ""why did he do that?"" or ""Doesn't he have enough evidence?"" or ""that is just plain stupid.""The dialogue was corny, cliche, and just plain dumb.I think you could close your eyes, point at any movie in a video store, and the movie you select would easily be better than this.Stay away from this movie. I dont know how anyone could give it above 2 stars."
5,Great movie,Great movie....fast shipment...A+A+full of action almost every minute...I will buy all his movies.....the best i have seen in a lonf time
2,Not the Jason I know - Skip!,"If you're watching this movie because of Jason Statham, you should skip this one. Filmed in England with an English cast, the movie is Bland at best. The sound is horrible, the movie line is slow, and the action is none existent. The movie jumps back and forth leaving you guessing what happened and why are these parts being shown. The characters are out of place and you're left wandering, um... what?Jason is less than ok in this film. This is not a Crank equivalent. This is a British movie gone horribly wrong.Suggestion: Totally skip this movie and save yourself 2 hours of sanity. If you do choose to view it, be prepared to drink a lot and have your tv volume turned up SUPER high... Made for TV or VHS at best."
2,Dissatisfied,There was no digital copy included. I would not have purchased this product if it wasn't supposed to include the digital copy. I enjoyed the movie in and of itself though
1,Blitz did not play,When I recieved the product I put in the BD playerand it would not work. I checked to see if it was the player and it was not
3,BORING VIGILANTE COP FILM,"The movie starts out with some thugs breaking into a car. Jason Statham does some illegal high sticking as he subdues them. He is a vigilante cop molded after Dirty Harry. The newspapers are crucifying him in the headlines, and he is nearly out of a job in London. Soon a cop serial killer (Aidan Gillen) appears on the scene. We know he is the killer as does the police. One of his killings is done in broad day light, yet they have trouble arresting him, even after they search his flat. And what was with the fat chicks dancing pretending to be sexy?We have seen rogue cop movies before and generally like them. This one brings nothing new to the table. If you are a fan of Statham's deadpan approach you might enjoy this film. Personally I felt, been there, done that, got the t-shirt while watching this film. The movie was boring even as Jason was shooting the bad guys in the head.F-bomb, no sex, no nudity."
4,Jason Takes The U.K.,Actor Jason Statham lays off the marshal arts gymnastics and takes an excellent thespian turn as Brant a detective who becomes involved with a cop serial killer played with just the right amount of sleaze by Aiden Gillen. Statham teams with another officer played by Paddy Considine to take him down dodging the obstacles placed in front of them by their own judicial system. Director Elliot Lester gives the film a gritty look showing the downside of the British scene resembling Director Harry Barber's excellent Michael Caine film 'HARRY BROWN'. It's good to see Statham in a different light and is a must for all his fans. This version from Millennium Entertainment that I viewed releases the film in a crisp 2.35 transfer with no extras. Good to pop back a few bottles of Bass ale and chill out to this good two-fisted crime yarn.
3,standard crime thriller with a twist.,"when i bought blitz, i thought i'd get the typical crime thriller with its predictable twists and turns, but who knew i'd also get an interesting peek into the identity politics that go on in big cities everywhere. while never pronounced or obvious, this film touches on the the tensions between black and white, poor and rich, men and women, gay and straight, and so many others. in the end, the film unfolds exactly as one would would predict, but it remains interesting as one finds out the statham character navigates the modern difficulties of big city crime fighting."
4,Typical Jason Statham Film,If you have seen one of his films than you have seen them all....Fortunately they don't get old. This was an exciting flick and definitely worth checking out.
3,Good Crime Drama Without Action,This is a movie to watch if you have time. It misses all the fight and action figures of Jason S. from his other smilar movies but it is a good movie to watch during a plane trip when there is nothing else to do.
3,Nearly a flop,"To start with I have to say that Jason Statham is one of my favorites; so I may be a little kinder than I should be for this UK movie. It starts off with a nice butt whipping so it caught my attention. The rest of the movie runs a bit slow and has a lot of character building. There is a good amount of cold blooded murder, ass whipping and a killer you may call barely believable but passable for the limited imagination this movie has. I do admit I did like the ending even though you can see it coming a (Kilometer) away.It is worth a watch in my opinion."
1,Jason Statham fan,I bought this movie without watching it first. I enjoy and watch most of his films numerous times. This is Statham's worst film and maybe the worst film I have ever watched. Low on action. Smaller plot lines within the movie went nowhere. Waste of money and time.
2,A YAWNER AND HARD TO FOLLOW,A mean cop goes after meaner criminals but there isn't much to like or relate to unless you like to see people get beat up. I watched it for a good half hour and just found it boring. Plus Statham was a bit much on his accent so it was hard to follow him. WHEN WATCHED: early September 2011 (streamed); MY GRADE: D plus to C minus.
2,Forgettable,"I am a Transporter fan, but this isn't Transporter.... I've already forgotten what it's about....This is Not Stethams best work...."
3,JASON GOES ROGUE,"Action star Jason Statham goes at it again in BLITZ. This time he's a loose cannon London cop on the trail of a serial cop killer. He teams up with a gay inspector (Paddy Considine) and closes in on the psycho (Aidan Gillen), climaxing in a brutal showdown.Underscoring the film is a poorly defined connection between Statham and Gillan's characters.BLITZ is a strictly adrenaline-propelled movie, not really breaking any new ground and suffers from the thick accents that often become undecipherable.Statham has a strong screen presence and Considine is effective, making BLITZ an okay actioner."
3,classic statham,"A typical jason statham movie, strong silent type explodes when provoked. All in all not a bad show, just couldn't hold a candle to the Broncos- Steelers game."
3,The movie,"Although a good actor, it is not the best of his movies. I'll read movie reviews prior to my next purchase."
4,Typical Rogue Cop But Well Acted,"Pretty typical rogue cop handles crime his own way in this suspense film of a police serial killer with some revengeful issues he's aiming to satisfy. The film makes no effort to hide the identity of the killer but weaves it's story around a few of the murders and Jason's attempt to identify and find the killer. Pretty straight forward but what makes this film worth the time is the acting for all involved was good+ enough to be entertaining and engaging. To illustrate, visualize Jason's usual disheveled raw urban persona during his interview of a witness. The witness asks, ""Ain't you gonna take any notes?"" to which Jason replies, ""Do I look like I carry a pencil?"" That sums up the movie but of course you have to see and hear it to appreciate it's import."
3,"THE BRITISH VERSION OF ""DIRTY HARRY"" IS WORTH A RENTAL!!","Jason Statham is one busy dude!! As many movies this guy is spitting out within the year, quality is bound to take a ride on the backseat!!! With this said, BLITZ is borderline straight to DVD quality. The only factors saving it is the random action and its main cast of Jason Statham, Paddy Considine and Aidan Gillen. All three give strong performances which hold your attention throughout the movie. What hinders the movie overall is the ""been there, done that"" plot of loose cannon cop with total opposite partner and the pointless and useless side story of characters we really don't care about but somehow get tied up to the main story.If you've seen the original DIRTY HARRY, you probably will be disappointed by this film because it simply can't compare. If your a Statham fan, by all means watch the film and see him do what he does best, but for the rest of you this movie is at least worth a rental."
2,Star power is not enough,"I like mindless violence as much as anybody. I first got started collecting Jason Statham when he was starring in the British ""ultraviolent"" movies.Unfortunately, unlike those movies, there is no one to like in this one. Nasty criminals pursued (and beaten) by nasty cops. Sorry, Jason. Maybe another time."
3,Tommy has sure got a great style of song,"I feel so privilaged, I attended the same college as Tommy. I was a few years ahead of him and never got to meet him, but I feel like I know him through his music.On this particular cd you will be greatly entertained by Tommys' voice. He has a very relaxed style of singing. It appears there is always a big smile on his face as he sings these beautiful songs. He will win you heart if you let him.The only downside to this cd is that some of the songs performed here, were not my favotires. There could have been a few better selections of song.Recommendation: I think you should buy this cd and experience ""The Sound Of Tommy Tune"""
4,Soft and Elegant,"Tommy Tune is no big belter, but he has a gentle, easy way with a song. Anyone who has seen him perform live knows he is a charming, graceful, delightful performer. This CD is just what the title promises: old-fashioned dance tunes at a relaxed tempo. Like a couple other half-way decent dancers who did a fair amount of singing, Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, Tune's voice falls lightly on the ear, and his inherent rhythmic style and musicality are impeccable. This is a great CD for quiet evenings of reminiscence and romance."
5,Wow!,"I've been blown away by Cindy's poetic lyrics and powerful voice... Every song tells a story that anyone could relate to. I can't get enough of her music. Cindy is here to stay.... why is it that she is yet to be discovered? I do know that once she is, she'll become a household name."
1,Not worth the effort,I purchased this kit from some hobby related tasks. The iron would not get hot enough to melt solder and the unit was smoking the entire 15 mintues I had it on.
3,Solder kit,"I had never used a soldering iron before, wanted to fix an earring. It took a loooong time, but once I got a lot of solder on the earring, the post finally adhered. Good price for experimenting/beginner."
1,Not hot enough,"I purchased this to remove some small capacitors from a circuit board. However, it would not melt the existing solder not matter how long I waited for it to heat up."
3,Get what you pay for,"I don't have a lot of soldering experience, but my boss gave me an ""old"" (2009) Samsung LCD TV that ""didn't work""...took it to a repair shop and they were going to charge $150 to fix it. I decided my computer hardware expertise + some youtube how-tos would do the trick. So for a total of about $15 I managed to fix the defective capacitor on the power board. This soldering iron worked, but took nearly 30 minutes to get hot enough to melt the Solder. Nice that it came with the solder sucking tool (no idea what you actually call it). I bet the solder that it came with isn't made for higher temp applications like a power board inside a TV, so I won't be surprised if it breaks in 6 months or less, but whatever. I'm pleased atm."
2,You get what you pay for!,I purchased this solder iron to work on my laptop. Problem is it's only 25 watts. It doesn't get hot enough to melt existing solder on my mother board. I would have bought the $80 one had I known that.
1,terrible,i had it plugged in for 5 minutes and it started losing it's heat in the tip already making it very difficult to fulfill the job i was doing. i would not recommend buying this item.
3,It's OK,"Compact and nice value.When I use for soldering it's work, but desoldering is not easy.Need more power on solder."
2,"This is a decent item, wouldn't purchase again","This item is pretty bad, it didn't get hot enough in 15 minutes to melt my solder so I had to buy a different kit to solder my solar panels together. As advice to a friend I wouldn't advise you to buy this item, this item doesn't work and it won't be good enough for whatever job you may be doing."
4,For a first timer,"I was very pleased with what I paid for...everything worked good, but if I ever get really involved, I'll get one that is a little better, but this whole kit did what I needed"
3,Soldering Tools,"It is just okay. The gun wasn't that hot. Mostly I bought the kit for the desolder tool, which worked great."
1,No solder included?,"Package was a bit crushed on arrival, but that's not much of an issue with the product itself - Just cheap packaging.However, the product lacked the soldering wick and the LF99 Solder that was supposed to be included. Amazon was nice enough to give me a small credit on the account - Enough to run to RadioShack and buy a replacement."
2,Soldering Iron,The soldering iron stopped heating from the tip after a few minutes which made it really difficult to solder. Wouldn't recommend it.
2,el cheapo!,"Iron only 25 watts, barely gets hot enough to desolder. Expected it to be at least 40 watts.Does not light up to show if Iron is on."
3,Not suitable for what I wanted.,"I should have listened to another reviewer who said that this did not get hot enough to repair the capacitors on a monitor. I thought I would take a chance since it was so cheap, and I got burned (but not enough, lol.) Do not buy this for that purpose, but if you just need a basic soldering iron that will do low-tech things, this will be okay."
2,You get what you pay for I guess,"Pretty cheap so my expectations where low. However, I wish I had spent more on a better one. Biggest complaint is that the very tip of the iron does not get hot, you have tilt it slightly in order to make contact with the side of the iron where there is more heat. This makes it hard to do precision work.Do yourself a favor and spend a few bucks more on something better."
5,THE Book when it comes to audio installations,"This is a great book, the part about technical grounds for audio installations is worth the money all by its own. It covers everything you need to know about audio installations, from the trivial to the most important, ranging from electrical wiring, grounding, racks, harness, patchbays, connectors, hardware interconnection, servicing, cable types and materials etc... This is THE electrical audio bible.As far as I know this book is one of a kind in its field, theres no other book which covers topics like electrical wiring and grounding directly focused towards the recording studio needs. It is definitely technically oriented, the math is by no means heavy duty but its definitely directed towards proffesional EE's or technicians rather than audio aficionados, yet the content of this book can be applied even to the smallest home recording studio.Its a shame that this book is no longer being published."
2,Pocket PC vs. IPod Touch,"If you're going to get a Pocket PC, this is the best one for the buck. But just get an iPhone. If you don't want to pay a monthly fee, buy a used iPhone. If you don't want to pay that much, buy an iPod.- An iPod Touch has better email and internet functionality (not perfect yet, though almost so)- This Pocket PC will give you better word and powerpoint use- They both have the same kinds of applications, but this Pocket PC runs like 1987 and the iPod Touch runs like 2005."
5,just what I wanted,"THIS SERVES MY NEED VERY WELL,I WAS GOING TO GET ANOTHER LAPTOP,HP iPAQ hx2495 Pocket PCBUT I WANTED SOMETHING SMALLER THAT WOULD FIT IN MY POCKET WHEN I AM OUT AND ABOUT. IN THESE DANGEROUS TIMES I DID NOT WANT TO ADVERTISE THAT I WAS CARRY SOMETHING FOR A THEIF TO STEAL! THIS FIT THE BILL AS IT CAN DO ANY AND EVERTHING THAT I NEED TO DO AND MORE, AND NO ONE IS THE WISER THAT I HAVE IT ON MY PERSON.ICARRY IT EVERYWHERE I GO."
2,Received in OK condition but with old OS,"Product was received in quick and satisfactory condition except the screen was scratched and the case pretty worn. Charged battery overnight but couldn't get the screen to come on. After reading owners guide without much success and with frustration increasing, tried a ""soft boot"" and it worked. Screen came up and I thought I was on my way - except I realized quickly that the operating software was a 2003 version which is not compatable with most programs that are now available. Email and web access were almost impossible to access, and no WIFI site that I tried would work."
5,iPAQ hx2495 Pocket PC,"I have Owned twice this model (I broke the screen on the first one), but I guess I never had that problems, maybe sometimes the battery It's not long lasting as one would like but it gives at least 3 hrs of wireless internet. I have loaded many programs that work pretty good including a ROM for a TI-89 calculator and it works just great (the Ti89 is like $300)I found that anytime I'm having a frozen screen a soft reboot is more than enough. WM5 doesn't close the programs and that's why you sometimes sun out of memory."
1,Hp supplies little or no service,"I bought the 2495 in Oct 2006, it would not sync. It never has. I bought the stores service agreement incase of problems. WELL, until your warrenty runs out it's useless. Finally with some flashlight looking we found the connections in the bottom of the unit that allow it to connect for sycn were unattached and bent over. I went online twice for help from Hp. They kept saying to redo the ram. YIKES. Finally we sent it to one of Hp's many contracted service centers. They want $250 to repair it. Said the damage isn't their fault. Tell me who's it is, if it has never worked? After moving up the ladder three times and getting the same we won't repair it. It is now being sent back without any service. Hp provides NOTHING. I would avoid this pocket Pc at all costs. It's just not worth it."
3,Should have been disclosed,I received the product with a sticker on the box showing that it had been returned because the screen freezes. The screen did in fact freeze to the point where it was impossible to use. I went to the HP site and re-loaded the ROM for WM5 but _not_ the update. Now it works much better but still is reluctant to start from being in sleep mode overnight at times. I will admit that the price I paid was more than $100.00 less than any other posting for the same item I have seen. I felt duped however when I received it with known problems. This should have been disclosed.
5,Great Sound,I was suprised at the great sound from this headphones. I already own a set of Altec Lansing PC speakers so I decided to buy these when I saw them. I am not at all dissapointed.
3,Altec Headphones,These headphones are just ok sounding. The ear piece is rather large and loose fitting. But other than that they are ok for the money spent.
4,Interesting,"I found this program interesting and occasionally frustrating.* Interesting - information about buddhism, the caves of buddhist and the art work in the caves along the silk road - places & stories I knew nothing about.* Frustrating - mainly because it seems the scientists they interviewed (Korean & Chinese) were done without interpretations. In reading the other review, I don't know if my copy had subtitles, so will replay it again (no subtitles when I watched it). Also - because I was unfamiliar with the area and history, there was not much introduction to what was going on & what had occurred in the excavations in the past.That said, if you are interested in: that part of the world - a different area of ancient buddhism - fascinating old buddhist art work - archaology & anthropology (any or all of these) and don't have great expectations, it is a very interesting program."
2,From Back Cover,"Wyoming rancher Toby Danforth was a man who marched to the beat of his own drum. So it was important to find a nanny for his motherless son who would do things his way. What he got was a stubborn beauty with a gift for handling his son, and a talent for reminding him what men and women were made for....Heather Burroughs had never met a sexier man than Tobias Danforth. Even though they disagreed on almost everything, his soul-stealing kisses rendered her feeble protests useless. And yet Heather knew she was walking a dangerous path, for when was it ever wise to make love to the boss?[7th in Dynasties: The Danforths series]"
2,"""Gentle Yoga ""needs visuals","The reason I gave ""Gentle Yoga"" only two stars is because it is only audio. I neglected to see that when I ordered. If it had picture it would be much easier to follow. With only audio it was hard for me to understand and visualize the poses."
2,Rip-off,"Good protector, nicelly packed with cloth, 2 finger gloves and small card to smoothen film, but only one protector!!! The competition sell for about the same price 15 protectors. What is worst, the product description doesn't specify this, I imagined (my mistake), that I would get at least 5. Will not buy it again"
5,Happy as a child! ;-),"When I was a little boy, through my imagination, I've lived this fantastic adventures of Captain Scarlet.I'm very happy to see, again, all this amazing stories."
4,Taking pepper one step up,This is a good spice to use in place of black pepper. For me it hit all the notes of pepper and adds more with some mild background flavors.
4,Great spice it just is not big enough for my use,As S. messer's said this is a great spice and is great in the Alton Brown/Food Network Super Apple Pie. I have gotten lots of compliments. Like S. messer's also said if you use it often get the bigger bag.
3,What is it?,"Looked everywhere for this spice and finally found it on Amazon. Couldn't wait to get it and finally see what it was. I'm still not quite sure what it is. It's described on the bottle, ""as a red-brown seed from Ghana"". You have to grind it before you can use it. It made little dark flecks in my apple pie, which were kind of pretty. I'm sure it made a flavor difference in my pie, but it was subtle."
5,US Second Edition Vs. UK Metal Box,"UKMetal Boxhas been remastered under John Lydon's direction in '96, whereas, US Second Edition CD was issued 1988. All the songs on UK Metal Box are 1-2 seconds longer than US Second Edition versions. Surprisingly, these longer seconds seem to be apparent in the UK songs intros: jangles, noises, and voices.Song order: Socialist and No Birds are reversed.Overall, US Second Edition seems a little more muted/lower key than the UK Metal Box, which is punchier, and more musical sounding. If you are a US Second Edition fan I think you will enjoy Metal Boxes' nuances."
1,Open up; make room for me,"I despise this album. I know that's enough to give all you indie/Punk/Post-Punk elitists all the more reason to buy this album and pretend you like it, so proceed to buy your tasteless little hearts out. But this fact remains: Second Edition is a waste of money. The semi spoken-word song called ""The Suit"" is interesting and worth hearing just for Lydon's rare, non-shrieking monotone, but screw the rest of the album. I prefer Lydon's melodious wailing from PiL circa 1983-1992. His solo dance album is tops as well (Psycho's Path, I believe). What else can I say; I'm happy with his lovely pop-infused work. I suppose I'm easy to please (unlike all you embittered pricks pretending to like something like Second Edition that Lydon purposely made to be unlistenable)"
4,One of the all time classics,"This is one of the definitive records of the late 70's. 20 years later it still holds up, although I wonder how it would be if you didn't catch it the first time around. Lydon can't really sing, and his attitude now seems more funny than anything, but Wobble and cohorts make it worthwhile."
3,Average,"Hailed as a masterwork when it came out, this album has not stood the test of time. To be sure, there are some powerful moments here, notably ""Albatross,"" ""Careering,"" and the menacing ""Poptones."" But Public Image Ltd. is not the Sex Pistols, and this album, despite the bass-heavy content, is just not manic enough to complement Johnny Lydon's acid-tongue lyrics."
3,Memorable for two songs that are knockouts,"Most of this is pretty awful: loud, repetitious bass and Lydon wailing like a wounded cat. But then comes ""Poptones"" and ""Careering"". These are two of the scariest songs around-and they were made years before Trent Reznor even thought of ""Closer""!"
5,Love this album....,"I'm going to have to find it, dust it off and use that turntable I haven't turned on in 20 years."
5,Challenging listening,"This is the apex of punk ideas. If you love the Sex Pistols & The Clash first albums but were disappointed with the pomp and preening of the 80's then this is where it could have all gone right. This album has all the energy of punk, all the space of Dub Reggae, the foresight of electronic music and the experimentation of an alchemist. This is really aspirational and inspirational. You need to set some time aside to appreciate the denseness of ""Poptones"" or the odd noises of ""Careering."" There is so much going on that it can't hope to cover every base to the satisfaction of everyone. If you buy a PIL album make it this one as it wants to be listened to more than heard. It can give you an aural experience that covers many influences rather than a rock genre trip."
4,Not a Bad Read,"Anthony Swofford really gives the reader an inside look into his head. He's an angry, confused guy with a big dose of self-destruction and loathing. Good for the reader he's also thoughtful and deligent about putting those feelings onto paper. And as a bonus, he's actually a good writer. But if you're looking for an anction-packed book full of combat and running and gunning, read Blackhawk Down. Only the last 20 to 30 pages are about the actual war. The rest of the time it's about the nerve shattering waiting and buildup that drive young men, trained to kill better than anybody else, to disentigrate, inside and out."
2,"Not bad, not anything","I wanted to like this book badly, because I am married to a ""Jarhead"". Unfortunately, I simply did not enjoy the style of writing. He writes with an almost Hunter Thompson quality, just not as good or engaging.I was not offended by any of it, I know the Marine Corps, and his descriptions of his buddies rings true of most Marines I know, with some exceptions.The main problem with this book was that I was simply bored throughout. I should say however, that a Marine I find to be relatively intelligent said, ""This is the best book ever."" That being said, if you're in or connected to the USMC, you'll probably enjoy it, at least marginally. If you're not, in my opinion, it can be skipped. Read Evan Wright's _Generation Kill_ instead."
4,Cathartic account of a Marine's life.,"Certainly an interesting read. I picked this book up to get a soldier's perspective of the first Gulf War, and to help me understand the experiences the troops that are currently in Iraq are going through.What I didn't expect is that the book is mostly about the making of a soldier (the other battles), with the author's Gulf War experiences almost a secondary topic. Much of what is written is stereotypical, but from reading the many positive reviews from ex-soldiers indicates to me that the author's account is fairly on the mark.Overall, I'm glad I read the book. Both the War and Other Battles were instructive. I couldn't help but sense that the book was in essence a therapy session. I hope it worked. I will be looking out for future books by this author."
2,False Advertising,"What's labeled ""A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War..."" is actually a wierd guy's dark ramblings about life as a marine. In fact, through the first 180 out of 250 pages the Gulf War hasn't even started yet. We hear much more about Marine wives and girlfriends cheating than we do actual combat. Reading a first person narrative by someone not likable is a difficult task. Avoid this book."
2,Seriously?,"I find it moronic that Swofe expects us to believe that every urban legend story that happened to any (every?) unit during the war happened to him and his unit.Come'on Swofe, you wanna tell a story about the war, then admit it's fiction."
3,OK book for the non military reader.,"Swofford's book ""Jarhead"" will make Marine recruiters and parents of Marines cringe with his detailed ""off duty"" antics. As a former sailor in the US Navy I can relate to this as will other former military service members. Although well written, I feel that Mr.Swofford's philosophical ideals obout the Marine Corps and the Gulf war were not construed during his service time but rather after he was discharged as anyone who has served and has time to reflect what he has done while serving his country. I would recommend the book to people that have not been in the military but would caution them that Swofford's accounts of events are rather graphic and his languange ""colorful"". I don't believe any Marine officers would appreciate his view of the Marines."
3,Jarhead,"Not for ""New Marine Moms"". One mans disappointing view of the Marine Corps. Direct and easy to read. I hope he finds what he's looking for. I couldn't put it down, hoping for a hint of hopefulness. Unfortunatly, I didn't get it."
2,This book is therapy for Swofford,"Swofford gives his account of his experience in the Marines and the Gulf War. He reduces his exeriences to the rawest of emotions and his descriptions are never sugarcoated. It was obvious (even by Swofford's own account) that he was not only dealing with the hardships of life in the Marine Corps and war, but he was also fighting internal battles from his childhhod - mainly issues with his father. Some Marines can handle the cards the Marines and war deal him. Others, like Swofford, hold on to all of the negative aspects and allow them to fester. The result? Swofford sticks an M16 in his mouth when the going gets tough, pisses his pants when he must actually perform on the battle field, and then writes a book about it. This book was mildly entertaining, but being a former Marine made it clear that most of what Swofford cried and whined about, the majority of Marines would laugh about in retrospect."
2,Innacurate and Cynical with Glimpses of Brilliance,"Fine writing, but far too dark and brooding for my taste. Swofford's story is self absorbed and overwhelmingly cynical. A skewed vision of the Corps full of negative stereotypes. War is indeed ugly, but brave and good men make it bearable. Major B.D. Tucker, USMC, author of Breach, a Gulf War novel."
2,Ummm... So-So,"Luckily, due to the above reviews, I picked this book up at the library rather than purchase it. It began well with the attitude of this being the ""real"" story of a marine rather than the usual gung-ho, go-get'em book. However...after only reading one-half of the book, I find it terribly ""bitchy,"" with lots of day-to-day standard ""griping."" Maybe the last half will improve but I think I personally will set it aside and read something else right now instead. (I am an avid reader of military books of all kinds and am accustomed to the bad as well as the good side) - but this book just seems to be constant complaining about everything. A real downer!"
1,Total disgrace to all that have served,This book totally disgusted me. This disgrace to the armed forces tells of his homicidal and suicidal acts (to bad the statue of limitations is up). I hope no reader believes this is normal military life. The only thing I found usefully about this book is that it made a good fire!
4,"Not your typical ""war buff"" read","If you like, tanks, sniper kills, grenades and Medal of Honors, you may want to find another book to read. But, if you like the truth of one Marine's experiences being in the Corps during The Gulf War, look into this. Anthony's stories truly give you a idea of what Marine life is really like when deployed to some remote location. Author Anthony Swofford, uses his memories and emotions, and any grunt's chronic fears to set a whole new world for the reader. As a student still in high school, having high hopes of going into the Marine Corps, when the chance came up to choose a memoir about a Marines life, I jumped right into it. I must admit, I thought that it would be an action packed book of a Marine Scout Sniper that I would learn a lot from, what I soon found out though, was it was not that at all, however I learned so much more from the truthfulness of Jarhead, than any other war memoir."
2,Fails on multiple levels,"This is not a particularly good literary work, nor is it of much historical value. It is also not a particularly interesting personal memoir.Swofford comes off more than anything as having been an immature jerk who wallowed in self-pity while in the Marines. And one has to wonder how accurate are his recollections from Gulf War I and earlier, considering the number years that elapsed between the events described and his committing his thoughts to paper. Many of his recollections smack of embellishment for literary effect.Swofford also has the annoying tendency to equate his perspective with that of all Marines who served throughout history. While there have no doubt been similar Marines, it does a disservice to the Corps to imply that all have been like Swofford - drunken, undisciplined malcontents who regretted their service."
4,A slice of military life-warts and all,"I've never served in the military, and I can understand how people who have may take issue with this book for either blowing the lid on how soldiers really behave or overblowing the bad behavior scenes. Some of the snippets of how the men treat each other and, say, camels, are horrifying. But I don't think Swofford's glorifying them or presenting them in the hopes of making the military look bad. I think he's trying to show how human soldiers are, and that when they're left bored, afraid, and unsupervised for too long, they do get a bit crazy. Too bad not enough people in the military and government read this book prior to the Iraq Invasion, because then perhaps the stunts at Abu Ghraib could have been prevented."
2,"Not a Chronicle, More of a Monotonic Litany","I was looking forward to reading this book, based on the reviews on the back cover. Unfortunately, I didn't check what other readers had to say, and this should be a must for this book. After reading the first chapter, I realized that this was going to be a long read, due mostly to his whinning style that distracts and bores the reader: hardly the warrior spirit. If you want to be his shrink, then this book is for you. Otherwise, skip it. I gave it two stars because some parts were interesting, but overall, this is not a good book. I find disturbing his general irreverent attitude towards the Corps.Notice two things: (1) none of the critics on the back cover had military background that I know of, and (2) he refers to his fellow brothers in arms as ""marines"" (not as ""Marines""). That's a sample of what's inside."
2,"more ""and other battles"" than combat","This book has polarized more readers than it should. As an active-duty officer, I can tell you that the military experience varies across services, ranks, duy stations, and individuals. Judging from the book, Swofford was one of the bottom 10% guys that drags down the military. Herein lies the only real value of the work--it proves a decent case study of a leadership challenge. Many junior enlisted service members enter the military with the same emotional baggage that Swofford did. Most cope well, but some don't. Jarhead is subtitled ""and other battles"" for a reason: the Gulf War ""combat"" plays a minor role in the text. Is Swofford representative of the vast majority of service members? No. Does he take liberties with the truth? Probably. Would I take his writing seminar? Hell no. This book will be quickly forgotten, but it's worth borrowing for a quick read."
1,Three words: Bitter Lance Corporal,"Swofford managed a rare feat: writing a widely-read memoir of war without ever actually seeing combat. If you want to read the bitter and often fabricated ramblings of a young man who believes the Corps and the world owe him something, buy this book. If you want to read *good* fiction regarding the Marine Corps, try W.E.B. Griffin or (better yet) Owen West and his tale of the Marines in Somalia (Sharkman Six)."
1,Jarhead --- A Waste of Time and Money,"This is the most deplorable and insulting book I've read in years. Swofford takes blatant negativism about the Corps and piles it higher and deeper with each succeeding page. He tops off the negative with wild sea stories about him and his fellow Marines. He would lead people to believe Marine encampments were nothing but mini versions of Sodom and Gomorrah's and others' questionable actions that stretch one's credulity. His sniveling and dissembling throughout the book is tedious.Even the title of his book, Jarhead, is an insult unless the Corps I served in for seven years has changed dramatically since my time. Marines do not fancy being called Jarheads as Swofford claims. So far as I know, it was always a derogatory term used by other branches of the service much as Marines calling sailors Swabbies or soldiers, Doggies.This book is a waste of money not only in my opinion, but that of several former Marines with whom I have discussed the matter."
3,A warrior,"Not about the battle, but the man prepared to fight one. The men we need in tough times are not neccessarily the ones you want to live next to. Well done."
1,I AM EMBARASSED TO HAVE READ THIS BOOK!,"Cry baby Swofford depicts the US Marines as a dirty, filthy bunch of guys who are born to kill and cuss and drink. I have been married to a Marine for 9 years and he has been in the Corps for 27 years. He has served proudly in 2 wars and would be embarassed to read such garbage. After Sept. 11, we took our kids to a baseball game at a local stadium and our son noticed the guy next to us with a 'towel' on his head. He got very scared and wanted to go home. He thought the guy was there to 'blow the place up'. This instance alone is why I support the Marines, and the fact that I haven't seen my husband in 9 months. Swofford should have went to college and become a writer and skipped the Marines. He is a great writer, but the content is bad! Real men (and women) won't read this trash!"
2,I was a ten-percenter,"One of the USMC MOH recipients said that, in his experience, any unit in the Corps broke down into 10% leaders, 80% who did a good job when properly led, and 10% not worth the cost of a round to blow them away. After reading this book, I came away convinced that Mr. Swofford was not in the top ten percent.For comparison, I would suggest Frank Schaeffer's ""Keeping Faith.""My reason for interest - two children in the Corps, one in Kuwait and one at Pendleton."
1,Tall Tales and Urban Legends,"I was a Marine in '91 and my unit trained with the 7th Marines during Desert Shield. This book ispure fiction from a disgruntled sh*tbird. The truth of Desert Storm is too boring for a book and movie, so he just took every BS urban legend in the Corps and made it all happen to his unit."
4,Great first book,"Though set in the days as a Marine in the 1st Gulf War the book is about the man, not war. We all set off down the road of life, some stop along the way in the military where we are forever changed. This is a difficult stop if you are a thinking man, as the military does not like you to question what is going on at all. Swofford thinks; a talent lost in much of America.Swofford is a young writer with great promise. I got to know him from his book. I liked him and the book and hope this is not his high point, I hope he goes on to write more with the same gutsy style and honesty. I have heard him interviewed on NPR and he was interesting and thought provoking clever and fresh. This was my favorite book of 2003"
4,An honest account,"I have to admit that many of the anecdotes relayed in Anthony Swofford's JAR HEAD made me uncomfortable. I have very few ties to the military--no family there, only a couple friends, no one involved in combat--so for me, this book was the first personal window I had into the world of Desert Shield/Storm. I appreciated Swofford's honesty, and feel that I learned a lot from the book. Though I still find it difficult to understand the mentality of fighting for the sake of fighting, even when disagreeing with the motives behind a war, Swofford has drawn a world in which I can catch a glimpse of the pressures and conditions in the military--as well as the lasting effect military service can have."
1,The Diapered Sniper,"A self-loathing thief who seemingly spent the majority of the Gulf War complaining, crying, and wetting his skivies. If you're in the anti-war crowd, you'll want to buy a hundred copies and roll around in them in the nude. If you think there is no nobler profession than to be a soldier, you may loose your lunch.Behold, a liberal icon is born."
1,Pure B.S. Hype,"What a sad commentary on the Marine Corps this is, and, worse, one that unknowing civilians will think is a true depiction of the military. This book is all about making money with sensationalism, exageration, and down right lies. The most heart breaking thing about the poor author, is that he leaves the military without the one true thing that makes that journey worthwhile; pride and honor of having gone the extra mile that civilians will never know about. He could have writtent the book without the lies, and without thumping his chest over a war that many consider a minor skirmish in the history of the US military. What an ass!"
2,Have Pity For Author,"Went to the library to pick up ""Shooter"" but couldn't find it. Checked out ""Jarhead"" instead. What a mistake.Swofford could't hit his real target with a Barrett .50 even if he wanted to. Why? His real enemy is the platoon of demons waging battle in, and for, his mind and soul.Don't let young children the opportunity to glance at the inside of this. It is a mountain of profanity."
2,Surprised this was a 'best seller.',"While I have not served in the military I have the utmost respect and gratitude for those who have, especially those in Iraq and Afghanistan. I respect Swofford's service of our country, but I found myself having pity for him as a human being both before and after his Gulf War experience.I thought this book was fair entertainment and semi-interesting at times, but I certainly wouldn't consider it great war literature along the lines of Hemingway or Dos Passos. I'm sure that those currently in Iraq or Afghanistan will have stories that will blow Swofford's away. Had it not been for our invasion of Iraq in 2003 I doubt that this book would even have been published.I would only recommend this book as casual entertainment. If you want a great account of a real event I would suggest reading (not seeing - book better than the movie) Blackhawk Down."
2,Simply OK,"This book is simply OK. From what I can tell it chronicles fairly well what Swofford's experience was indeed like. However, it isn't engaging or in depth enough to really warrant close reading. I feel like I could have just read the Wikipedia entry for this book and been just as informed."
4,More a personal milestone than a literary one...,"You are away from home on a business trip, drinking a beer though you're not thirsty, eating bartop peanuts though you're not hungry, watching a basketball game on television though you could not care less about basketball. You begin to talk to the man next to you who turns out to be a Gulf War veteran. If you earn his trust and seem as though you're interested, this might be the story he would tell you.Swofford's book comes across as an unedited, uncensored, unadulterated experience of Marine life in the Middle East. From the superficial overcompensating ego to the honest insecurity just beneath the surface, the book is less a literary milestone than a personal one. It was no doubt a challenging book to write and as such is a challenging book to read, but the honesty is worth your time and consideration as the world again fails to spare a generation the personal and societal conflicts of war."
1,Unrealistic.. Period,"As a former Marine who served on active duty for 5 years at the time of this ""story"" (for 5 years 1987-1992). This is a unrealistic example of someone who had a ""anti"" agenda. I read the book when it was published and I still think this ""bird"" had an agenda when writting the book. The media took off on it as it's ""anti"" Bush."
1,Nothing could be further from the truth,"I am a Marine officer candidate and I know quite a few Marines. Not a single Marine who's read this book likes it the very least, not because this book makes us ""look bad"", but because he is not telling the truth. He's simply telling a story that he knows some civilians want to hear. It's almost funny when he tried so hard yet unsuccefully to establish a relationship between the Gulf War and oil companies. He knows some people just are dying to read that part. If you want to learn about the Marine Corps, this book is definitely NOT what you want. Most of it is about his own reproductive organs or constant swearing. When it does mention the Marine Corps, it simply paints a false picture."
1,"Honor, Courage, Commitment are things Swoff Doesn't Have","It really saddens me to see a Troubled guy like this making a book, And it's awful that it got picked up by a publisher. But, If you make a book about ""Anti-Military"", It's almost assured to be somewhat popular.For Anthony Swofford to have Psychological problems like this, and endure the stress of The corps, is like rubbing Gasoline in an open wound: It's only bound to increase the problem. I hope to one day join the ""Band of Brothers"" and serve my country proudly. I only pray i will not run into thieving showboats like ""Swoff""- A disservice to the United States Military.Its guys like him that are the only thing I hesitate joining the Marine Corps for.Also: Isn't it a little strange that EVERYONE (except for one or two people) in this book is a backstabbing, lying, have-no-honor jerk?"
3,His version,"Bully on all you Marines that instead of giving praise to another brother you pull out the jealousy act and reprimand his writing. This is based on HIS truth HIS version of things. Yeah alot maybe embellished but this is still HIS version. I enjoyed the book for what it was a glimps of a good, and sad memory of that time. He did get introspective at times and maybe overly self centered but I did enjoy it just the same and I do infact wish him many more successes. Lets see all you other Jarheads pen your own thoughts instead of dumping on anothers. Have courage."
2,Pointless.,"Pages 217-236 are about the actual war and are fairly well written. The rest of the book is written in the style of an angst-filled girl in her early teens. I frequently found myself rolling my eyes at the way the author would describe a particular situation.The book is also horribly overwritten. Chapters are devoted to relationships that have no bearing on the overall story. The book has a schizophrenic feel with chapters jumping between the past, present, and future. This shouldn't be surprising as the author seems to suffer from a dozen psychological problems.The only reason I read the book to the end was so that I could write a review here and warn others that the reviews you heard on CSPAN and NPR were horribly wrong."
1,False Pretense,"This book is sold under the pretense of being the memoirs of a jarhead. I found it to be the memoirs of a person who is unhappy (who happened to be a jarhead). He was unhappy before he was a jarhead, he was unhappy while he was a jarhead, and he is unhappy after he was a jarhead. Furthermore, he had problems with his father, his mother, his sister, his brother and with God. Should it be a shocker that he problems with the Marine Corps? As the father of a Marine about to leave for Iraq, I would be blown away if my son had an outlook on life like that of the author. Only buy this book if you enjoy reading the misery that some people choose to live in."
2,Jarhead...what else is new,"I found the book repetious, in that so many books have been written about the warriors inner feelings, fears, emotions and motivatioins as they approach battle. i will give him credit for honesty, modesty and courage in the telling. But anyone of of his mates or those in other wars could have written the same stuff. I came to the conclusion that this was a therapy session for the writer, a catharsis of sorts, that gave him meaning to decisions that he made in his life that go him into the Marines..maybe stating wiht his father? Why not isn't that where most good stories get started..if not the family unit and growing up loved or not?Woodmnn"
1,Plaintive drone,"As an author who is currently writing the biographical memoirs of his uncle who was a Marine(machine-gunner) and served in the battles of the Marshall Islands,Saipan,Tinian and Iwo Jima-I can not recognize the Marine Corps of which this author speaks. For the last year and a half I have interviewed my uncle and many of the Marines who served with him on the front lines of these brutal battles and not one of them has anything to say that remotely resembles Swofford's assertions.Most of these battles lost more men in five minutes than was lost in both Gulf Wars combined.Yet I have not heard the cynicism or bitterness from these heroes which seems to consume Swofford. The book entirely misses the essence of what I have come learn is the essence of a Marine. Swoffard certainly has no esprit. This book is a story less of the author's Marine Corps experience and more of his own demons and shortcomings."
1,I've got a story......,"When I graduated from boot camp the Drill Instructor told the platoon: If you take any large group of people there will allways be 10% of that group who just don't get it.He said we should try to locate those people as quickly as possible, and stay as far away from them as possible. In peace time they will get you into trouble, and in combat they will get you killed.Great advice."
1,"I love war books, but hate this one","Boring, laced with profanity, raunchiness, whiny, so I find it difficult to relate to this author. He seems like a cry baby to me, and not very intelligent. The book is written to make it seem more than it is, which isn't very much at all. And the constant attempt to make everything poetic is very annoying and an obvious filler technique. This book just sucks! The worst personal perspective war book I think exist. I have no idea how this became a movie, but then there are plenty of stupid movies made all the time."
1,What is the point?,"So what is Swofford trying to tell us? OK he learned how to curse and swear.. So he made a mistake in joining the military. There is no God ?? The last sentence in the book ""Dig your holes with the hands God gave you."", is he telling us he has now found God??? I always try to finish a book once I start it, so I did read the entire story, what a waste of time.. Save you money..."
4,"Great, but Slow","While I thoroughly enjoyed Swofford's Jarhead, I wasn't pulled into it. Something about it was painstakingly slow, which, I suppose, mirrors Swofford's own experience in the Gulf War.Besides the pace, the book is clever, intense, profane, and, at times, a little gut-wrenching. If you're dedicated, your motivation will certainly pay off."
4,A literary bullet,"Dear Anthony, keep going with the writing! I really enjoyed your FUBAR tale of the Gulf War. Anyone out [of the military] has a different opinion of those that were there [Gulf War I & II] and still 'in'.How can one judge objectively if not stepping back from the [said] situation? That's why you got and will probably keep getting flak for this from those still 'in'.Just like the chorus in the song...""Tell it like it is""! I read this in three days - couldn't put it down. Being a former squid, our locations may have been different, but the tale is the same - only the names have been changed.See you anywhere soon - except the barber shop!All the best and remember, now when we hear the word 'duck' we know it means food."
2,Truth or Fiction,"I'm about half way through the book and I had to read some of the reviews to see if other former Marines were thinking what I was thinking, which was ""this doesn't resemble the Marine Corps I served in!""I was and enlisted Marine from 76-82 and while some of Swoffords descriptions of the antics of his fellow Marines bring back memories by and large I do not recognize the Marines he described. The people I served with were more disciplined and just plain better people. I hope that people who read this book and do not know better do not accept the things that Swofford describes as standard for US Marines. They are not."
3,Now the movie.....,"Just got finished reading ""Jarhead"" I probably like it more than I should because it is brief. I find too many military books are brutally long. It is what it is- one mans psychological oddessey through a short tour in the Marines and a brief time in the first Gulf War. I will say it seems honest, The author certainly doesn't try to make you like him or empathise with him. I, for one, would not want to spend much time hanging out with the guy who wrote this book. The best part about it is his description of life in the peacetime service- not a very pretty picture. Anyway, I read it because my son reccommended the movie.I am very curious to see how the book translates to film."
1,Not likely to be a classic,"I read Jarhead as a result of the very favorable reviews that it garnered and the fact that I have read most of the memoirs of this genre. A couple of the reviewers compared this book to a Rumor of War or Friendly Fire. Not in your wildest dreams. I kept waiting for the book to develop into something more than a puerile confessional until I realized that it wasn't going to happen. Most of us who have been in the military knew a few jerks like the author, but generally avoided them. It had some very readable moments, but there were all too few of them."
4,BETTER THAN THE MOVIE!!!,First off: if you didn't read the book and only saw what's in the movie then shutup. For the most part the movie followed the book as close as Hollywood can get it. Jarhead was brutally honest and really allows someone to get inside the mind of an infantry Marine. As a Marine myself I think every Marine can relate to this book in one way or another regardless of his/her occupation. My biggest pitfall with the book is the negative portrayal of not just Marine officers but also NCOs (ex: Sgts) and senior enlisted Marines. The warrior culture of the Marine Corps is a culture shock to anyone looking at us from the outside. It is this culture that separates us from the other services and makes us who we are. It's about time a Marine like Anthony Swofford has presented an honest and enlightening narrative of the Marine Corps from an enlisted Marine's point of view. Semper Fi!!
3,Honest Warrior Expose,"This is an intersting, well written and straight forward account of a young man's time in the Marines, the Gulf War-including the build up and 4 or so days of war, and the fellow soldiers who experienced it with him.I would recommend this as an open tale of the positives and negatives of the Marine Corp and the military in general. For me, having no military experience at all, nor any immediate family who does either, this is was a good read. There is some of the mythical nature of the Corp, the braggadocio, the hyper-masculinity, the rawness of young men made to kill as well as the humanity, isolation, and loneliness, which Swofford very effectively expresses.The film too captures the time in the Gulf in particular. Much of the story which took place in America was pared down for the film."
4,Entertaining and frustrating,"Everyone has something to say about Jarhead. You love it, you hate it... I found it very entertaining. Swofford is a great writer, whether or not his story is slightly embellished. He doesn't shy from the grit, the nastiness, the ugly realities of a combat deployment. Some Marines despise the man, and their anger is understandable. He does seem to stretch the truth to suit his purpose as a writer, but the end result is still a highly readable story.I think anyone who enjoyed Swofford would also enjoy ""Suffer in Silence"" by David Reid. Unlike many writers, he doesn't pull any punches, offering a very real glimpse into the world of Navy SEAL training, which is a good deal more painful than anything Swofford can describe. If you liked Swofford, I recommend Reid.All in all, a good book, if occassionally frustating."
2,Not What I was expecting,"I didn't have to get very far into the book before I realized that the book didn't live up to the hype. I was hoping to read about a grunts combat experience. What was provided was scant and really only limited to GW1. Unless Swofford's ""other battles"" were the one's in his head you could say that the title is a little misleading. Yes, there were a few amusing moments (the kazoo) and one to two moments that spoke of the horrors of war (dead Iraqi soldiers with hands over ears) but the overall whiny tone that Swofford employeed dulled them out."
4,"gritty, insightful and raw","In ""Jarhead"" Anthony Swofford paints a unblinkingly raw picture of life in the military. His career in the Marines starts as a child of Seventeen already hopelessly in love with the romantic notions of soldiering. Those notions quickly dissolve as the harsh realities of the life of a soldier begin to wear and tear at the fabric of his soul. He offers insights to armed service life that is rarely portrayed - and his memories of his short time in the Gulf War are brutal and honest. this book is not a glorification of Military life. On the contrary, it is a stark, bloody, baudy, bold and jarringly sophisticated slice of life that will leave you thinking about what you thought you knew about our Government and those who choose to protect her."
3,Holden Caufeld as a Marine,"This reminded me of Catcher in the Rye. The author uses vulgarity like Holden, has fantasy relationships with women in many scenarios and generally has an opinion on anything and everything. I'm not military or prep school, but if you could switch the characters out the narrative would change very little.I felt the book switched directions and never really got momentum. It felt very hodgepodge and I'm surprised it got picked up for a movie. Without commenting on the author or his opinions, if you're looking for something to read for enjoyment, this one is average at best."
2,A book about the troubled mind and life of his author,"I very much agree with Kathy from Jupiter (1st reviewer). Basically this is more a pshychological story, a coming of age book than anything else. The author is a poor troubled mind, he doesn't know himself and uses us as his psychoanalist. He admits being atheist -or agnostic at best-. He has a love vs hate relationship with his country -or so it seems, he doesn't know what he wants and the poor chap wants us to feel sympathy for him. He surely is going to get some hug from the critics and pseudointelectuals at campuses and the New York Times, but not from me.I don't know what the author really intended to do by writing this rather chaotic book of personal experiences -not much is said about the actual war; it's rather about him, his messed up mind-. The only thing I know is that he wasted some of my time and money, but as for simpathy he'd better look elsewhere."
2,A Marine's Training & Deployment,"The author provides an insight into the training and deployment experiences of a Marine ""sniper"". He depicts real-life, day-to-day activities in the military, including the mundane as well as the exciting.If you are interested in an overview of a young Marine's military experiences, you may enjoy this book, however, I suggest you review ""With The Old Breed"" by Eugene B. Sledge as you may find it far more compelling.I have the utmost regard for our young men in the Armed Services, however, I confess that I lost my admiration for the author, early in the book, when he admits stealing from his fellow soldiers to secure ""drinking"" money."
3,it's worth a read,"Jarhead by Anthony Swofford, is the memoir of a former U.S. Marine sniper during the first Gulf War in 1991. It's a very intelligent and humorous look at military life for a new generation. Swofford was stationed in Saudi Arabia, at the northern most area right behind Kuwait for more than six months before the short-lived combat started. This was called ""Operation Desert Shield"", as to shield the massive oil wells of Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi Republic Guard. As you know, the actual combat, ""Operation Desert Storm"" started in January and was over in late February."
2,Not what I expected,"Although the anguish of combat and graphic scenes of death and devastation that the author encountered must have been overwhelming (and I fortunately have never had to deal with such awful circumstances), I found myself wondering what the book was telling me. Was the author disturbed by his wartime experience, or before it by his own life experience?He makes the case that Marines, or ""Jarheads"" must all think and act like hard-living drunken killing machines, but many of the Marines I know and have known were simply not cut from that cloth.I certainly hope for the sake of our military that there are finer examples of proud Americans serving their country (in peace or war), that are more worthy of our respect than the soldiers the author describes."
4,Many more wars than the Gulf fought in this novel.,"Very Similar to ""The Things They Carried"" in style, Jarhead explores the tale of a soldier behind the lines and behind the scenes. Swofford tells it like it is, with all its crudeness and reality. The disillusionment felt by all the men is astounding, and worth the read. Swofford writes very well, and this is a great story that shows war is so much more than it seems."
2,View from the bottom 5%.....,"In the Corps, the saying goes, ""5% of your Marines are bad, and they will eat up 90% of your time."" As a Marine Leader of 12 years, I can tell you that the first thing one does is develop the ability to spot that five percent in about ten seconds. Reading Swofford's book, he jumped out immediately as one of those less than stellar Marines. The same has been noted by other Marines who have written reviews here. While his writing is clear and colorful, his ""problem-child"" preoccupations prevent the book from being considered with the classic war memoirs, such as The Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer or Fields of Fire by James Webb. If you have not read much in the way of military memoir, there are many other options. For those who want something more recent than the two excellent books I just mentioned, young Nathaniel Fick's One Bullet Away is highly recommended."
4,Sobering,"A sobering look at life in the US Armed Forces. There is no sugar coating. All is in its raw form (that means raw language too). Excitement, boredom, risk, luck, suffering, partying, frustration, death, and more."
4,Excellent dialogue,"I just recently bought the book and read it in a few days. I do not think it is particularly strong on character development nor do I think the plot of the book is going to surprise anyone; it is, afterall, a chronicle of an already very well chronicled war. BUT, the dialogue is excellent, it had me chuckling and laughing several times, and the writing style is strong and engaging. I would compare it to Pulp Fiction, Full Metal Jacket and Training Day where the dialogue of the characters, along with a standout performance here and there, is the backbone of the movie. I read an excerpt of this book in the CalAggie alumni magazine (I tried to join the Marines in the summer of 1990 and went to the Oakland MEPS only to be declined on a medical technicality. A few days later I was a freshman at UCD)and decided to buy it because it sounded interesting and because Mr. Swofford had spent some time in this area. I am glad I did and I wholly endorse this book."
1,Not the same Marine Corps I was in,"I am a Retired Marine Gunny (Gunnery Sergeant), and while I was in the Corps during Desert Storm, I did not deploy. I remember seeing this movie when it came out a few years ago and not thinking much of it, then decided to read the book over the holidays. My first warning sign was the repeated use of 'marine' and not Marine, as every Marine I have ever served with knows that amongst Marines at least you always treat it as a proper noun. Grammar lesson aside, I am just surprised at the overall tone of the book; Marines I served with and come in contact with were always motivated and dedicated to the accomplishment of the mission and treat all fellow Marines with dignity and respect. Some of the stuff mentioned in the book is spot on, but I doubt I will finish reading it because this is just not the same Marine Corps I fondly remember. Of course I don't think I was in the same Marine Corps as John Murtha either.Vincent PagnoniGunnery SergeantUSMC (Retired)"
1,Bottom 10% speaks,"This was a difficult book to read because lacks mature analysis. In the military, platoon and company leaders complain that 90% of their time is taken by the bottom 10% of the Marines, which are those who think being a punk and being tough is the same thing. Swofford appear to be one of the 10%. Swofford lays the ""troubled youth"" on thick. An adolescent thinker, Swofford spends more time talking about drinking, acting suicidal/homicidal and other complaints than on thoughtful analysis of the topics he raises. A Marine reading the book will see this fast. There are a host of better books, so do not be lured in by a desire to learn about the Gulf war. Read Webb's Field of Fire for a look into a Marine's mind. wait for a good Gulf war book."
3,"an interesting book, but...","While I understand the book was a NY Times best-seller, many people missed the point on the author. While he was a Marine, and many of his scenes of life in Iraq or 29 Palms is true, it is far from representative of all Marines - this is a man with a drinking and anger management problem who used his time in Iraq as a crutch for his personal problems. Many, many Marines returned from Desert Storm, or their current deployments from Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11 without the drinking and other issues Swoffard blames on others. The moral of his story ? The Marine Corps is liable for all his problems. How disappointing."
2,A bit too profane for me...,"Because Swofford's book got favorable reviews and because I served with the Marines during the latter part of the Korean Conflict, I thought I'd enjoy this book. It has it moments, mostly later in the book, when the author begins so show a bit more humanity. I must have run with a different group of Marines or maybe it's a generational thing, but none were as raunchy or vulgar as those Swofford describes. Sure, we got drunk plenty of times and our language sometimes was 'not for publication' (in those days, anyway), but nothing so much as his buddies in this book. For someone who only spent a few weeks in actual combat, Swofford comes across as very bitter and angry. I admit I might have felt that way if I were in the current mess involving an unjustified invasion of Iraq, but Desert Storm was reasonably justified. I was disappointed by Jarhead but would like to know what other Marines think about this book."
2,"Poor story, by a poor Marine","After the first couple of pages I was ready to throw the book away. If you are looking for a story that regales the Marines this is not it. I was going to send it to a friend of mine who is a true Marine serving with a Scout Sniper Platoon; he had already read the book along with several other Marines in his unit, every one of them disliked it. It is unfortunate that the author did not have a more positive experience, maybe its because he hasn't had a positive experience with life yet. You get out of the Corps what you put into it. Obviously he didn't put much into it, it shows in his book."
2,FUBAR,"Swofford paints himself as everymarine. If he is prototypical, God help the Corps and God help the USA. Swofford is an excellent writer, but he goes too far in his vision that all Marines are Swofford look-alikes. His views of the Corps are as skewed as Oliver Stone's view of the ""average"" platoon in Viet Nam. Read it for the writing talent, but take what he says about the Corps with a grain . . . no, make that a bag of salt."
2,WTFO - This does not deserve a review but...,"I am a Panama (Just Cause) & Desert Shield/Storm vet, and after seeing the movie I read the book... well almost all of it. This guy is a problem child PERIOD! Pissed off at the world, pissed off at life, and very lucky I didn't get my hands on him. Snipers are crazy as another review stated, but this guy is that 5% of the Corps that that can give the other 95% a bad name. Some of the boredom issues were true, wives/girlfriends dumping us was true, etc... but overall this guy just REALLY ticked me off... but THAT IS HIS GOAL IN LIFE ISN'T IT... Books about God, Country, Corps; things that are still thought, and observed by every Marine may just not shock the masses as much as a book aboutsome discontented, nonhacker, shiptbird."
3,Not what I'd hoped.,"I was really disappointed in the book. I found it self-consciously ""literary"" and elliptical. There is too much attention given to Swofford's pre-war sexual difficulties and not enough to the general experience of a Marine grunt in Gulf War I. I think that the book might have been better before the author had been through the University of Iowa writing school. It smells of the lamp, alas. In addition, there is a post-Vietnam self-pity for what is, at best, a poor excuse for a war. Go look at Vietnam. Or Korea. Or, or course, WWII."
1,Pure crap.,"Has anyone noticed how all of the positive reviews come from people who have not served?This book is disgraceful, and the fact that they are actually making it into a movie is beyond disgraceful. Thanks a lot Hollywood, now I have to explain to all my civilian friends yet again that life in the marine corps is nothing like what they see on TV."
5,Audio version adds value,"Although the audio version has been criticized for its somewhat monotone delivery, it brings out more clearly the literary value of this work, not to mention adding to its authenticity. I was captivated!"
1,Poor Excuse For a Marine,I agree with another reviwer there should be negative number for this book. Being a former Marine I find this book to be a disgrace to our Corps. I agree with several other reviews that indicated inaccurate information in the book and also the fact that he never treats the word Marine as a proper noun shows that he has no respect. This is a waste of money and I wish that I would of read the reviews before the book they were much better then the book. I will never waste money on another piece of garbage that swafford writes again. Please don't buy this book and disrespect all of the great men and women who go to work in harms way for us everyday.
2,Disappointing,"I read Jarhead based on the recommendations of a writing instructor, and was greatly disappointed. I like good memoirs, but Swofford's book is an exercise in self-absorption with no intellectual leap beyond immediate experience, and by misrepresenting the full gamut of military life, it panders to kneejerk antimilitarism.Yes, full disclosure, I'm a veteran, but not from the Marine Corps. The armed forces are no less dysfunctional than any other human institution, but the reality of military life is far more interesting and complicated than Swofford portrays it."
3,Another Jarhead reviewing Jarhead,"I have to agree with Iraq grunt on his take. This is a good book, but has quite a bit of inaccuracies and exaggerations. I was a T.O.W. gunner grunt for 1/1 and 2/1 and had quite a bit of exposure to STA platoons and Snipers in general. Most of the behavior talked about by Swafford would not be tolerated amoungst their ranks. They are some of the most professional Marines I have met. Of course, Marines are not happy unless complaining about something so Swafford got that right. I won't nit pick it all but Mr. Swafford wrote an interesting piece of fictional non fiction. It was a pretty decent read."
5,A real war story -- not for the faint of heart,"To the uninitiated, this book will at times seem vulgar, crude, unvarnished, sick, and amoral. But in many ways, those descriptions are an essential part of the story. Military life has never been easy -- since the days when Roman soldiers marched on Gaul to the days when Civil War soldiers marched 20 miles a day with little more than a biscuit -- the life of an infantryman has been nasty, brutish and short. Anthony Swofford adds his war story to this pantheon; his voice is startingly and brutally honest.A military historian once said that the study of combat by those who have not seen it is akin to the study of sex by virgins, with only pornography to look at. Swofford's book fits that maxim well, though don't expect the neat or sensitive pornography of war that we've gotten out of the mainstream press lately. Jarhead tells its war stories the only way a Marine can -- hardcore, no holds barred, no censorship."
1,garbage,"Being highly rated by the NY Times should have made me suspicious, but I fell for the war theme and expected all you would of a superior chronicle of man's nobility in and the futility of war. Instead all I read was an expletive laced, poorly written version of one loosers attempt to come to grips with himself among real men.This was about as pathetic a diatribe against what little battle this sod saw.If I wasn't so disgusted with the quality and quantity of this screed I would have paid money to return it to the publisher.Instead I'll content myself with tossing it in the garbage and hoping my review will trash anyones desire to read this. I wish there were a negative star I could assign this book.Simply one of the worst things I've ever read."
1,Please!,"I don't know what Marine Corps this guy was in, but it wasn't the same one I belonged to. I was a grunt, and I knew some STA guys in our battalion. I have no idea where the tales in this book came from.Did our Marines have some problems? Sure they did! They were human! We drank too much, talked much trash, (...), just like he said. Some of us had seniors appointed over us in accordance with the ""Peter Principle.""The things he tells about in this book, though, are outlandish! The attitudes and activities he attributes to the men of the 7th Marines are disgraceful. I have no idea how he managed to get as far as he did, but he is a perfect example of the 1% that always slip through.I read this book against my better judgement. All it did was p*ss me off. This is decidedly not an accurate portrayal of this nation's Marine Corps."
3,Animal House Goes to War,"Bluto, Otter and the Delta House gang go to the Desert to safeguard cowardly Kuwaitis and pump up the profits for ""Big Oil"". Why is it that the only ""war"" books that get rave reviews are anti-war screeds? Those with little or no exposure to the military should find this book interesting, to say the least, and perhaps frightening. You give a 19 year old man Marine training, immerse him in Marine culture, then send him to war with his buddies and you get a lot of behaviors that will shock your average civilian. The author is a good wordsmith and truly captures life in the Saudi desert during the long build up to the ground war. His dipiction of Marine life prior to the war is also very good. Not bad. Not great."
1,Poorly Written and Unimpressive,"Could we have any more run-on sentences, poor grammar, or poor sentence construction? I find it inconceivable that any decent publisher would pay this guy money for what he puts on paper. I was given this book from a publisher to proof the galleys before going to print and I wanted to rewrite the whole thing! By page 20 I wanted to throw it out and by page 60 I wanted to... It's also a great game to count how many times this guy can use [profanity] per page. If you don't mind reading the [sad] self-pity party of an immature whiner, then you might like it. Otherwise, don't bother. Good thing I was paid to read it; I wouldn't have spent the money to purchase."
1,Worst war book ever,"Completely dissappointed. This is one of the worst books I have ever had the misfortune to read. SWOF writes like a suicidal depressed teenager who has seen to many introspective black teen angst movies. His 'war stories' are laughable - he never fired a shot. Ok he saw a tank and some planes and was in the vicinity of real fighting. Ok he saw dead Iraqis after the fact. He plays it up like Iwo Jima. He knows the 'horrors' of war now. Please. Dont buy it. Read 'About Face"" by Hackworth, or ""The Forgotten Soldier"" by Guy Sajer or....any other book for that matter."
2,Jarhead,"I read this book on a recommendation of ""Christine"", the cheating girlfriend that Tony refers to in this book. I have also met the post war Tony on a few occasions as I was ""Christine's"" roomate for several years. I was disappointed that such a talented writer would sell out on his first book. He hated the Marines which is evident in the book and never mentioned it after he was out of the corp. But it was good timing, with another war starting, to write this one. Just the easy road to a quick half a million $$. The more lies I read in the book the angrier I became. It was entertaining to read how a man justifies his numerous cheating escaped by saying his girlfriend was doing it too. Which she wasn't, at least not with who he thought. But I guess, this again was a good way to sell books, with sex. I did learn a lot about war and the Military from the book. I just can't determine which is fact and which is fiction."
1,JarHead Is The Story Of A Marine Who Sold Out,"I wrote an earlier review, but it got pulled. Hmmm, I wonder why? Anyway, I'll sum up what I said before. Other Marines and armed forces reviewers pretty much backed up what I wrote. Many of the tales in this book are urban legends. Although one reviewer said the tales of whoring are 100% true, I wonder if some of his encounters were. I found it odd that one of the girls he shacked up with happened to be a virgin, and that there was so much drama over it. His actions as a scout sniper, as others have said, are grossly misrepresentative of the real deal. As I've said before, Swofford is a liar; you don't have to be in the Marines to see that. He's a real embarassment to anyone he's ever worked for, even McDonald's. He'd sell out anything to make a buck."
1,Jarhead,"Unfortuantly Anthony Swofford joined the Marine Corps with problems. What you read in his book is his experience dealing with his OWN demons while serving in the US Marines. I find it hard to believe we served in the same Marine Corps, around the same time, and both as infantrymen. I want to make it clear that most Infantry Marines don't steal, sell stolen good, or turn in their own Drill Instructors. Swofford constantly tries to convince the reader that he is intellectually superior to his peers by giving you his reading list. I find the whole book a vain attempt to hide his inadequacies and to do so by promoting himself and tearing down his peers.The Marine Corps can be hard, but I am a better man for having served in the Corps. The so-called peace groups do nothing but attempt to cheapen our service and sacrifice."
2,Disappointing and Tedious,"As an ex-Navy guy, whose son is a Marine aviator, I got this book expecting a real interesting look at the inner workings of a ground pounding Marine in the organization. I'm a third of the way through the book and have found it tedious and disappointing. It is more a rememberance of his love conquests and inner emotions than anything related to the warrior. Perhaps I was expecting too much from the hype, but the book was not what I expected or wanted. Save your money."
1,Old Corp,"Old Corp to New CorpFighting forest fires or battling forces of nature are not new and neither is the consequence of action that tries to repel a force. This is a pure logic; unfortunately the Human capacity to deal with such odds cannot always strive to meet such emotional strains. We give medals to those who have accomplished such feats beyond all comprehension of rational thinking. Running into burning buildings, approaching repressive gunfire and the brutality of evil causes us to go where Angel fear to Tread.New Corp needs Old Corp like the vines need branches.Ira the Marine"
2,Juvenile war stories and bathroom humor,"As a parent with a son currently serving in the Middle East, the timing of this book was perfect. I hoped to learn some of what he is experiencing and something new about that part of the world.Didn't get it from this piece of Jr. High war story literature. There are a very few pages about the region and its people, a very few pages about the military actions he was involved in and the rest of the book is about his chafing problems (don't ask - you don't want to know - trust me!).More of a Jr. High macho man autobiography than anything else."
1,Not worth your time....,"Halfway through, I tore this paperback up and threw it away. He goes on and on about how bad the services are, but he is now an English professor at a small woman's college, his education paid for with GI benefits, no doubt. Why criticize on and on what has benefited your life immensely?"
1,Jarhead : An anti-Marine Corps Mission,Jarhead is clearly an UNSUCCESSFUL attempt to embarass Marines and former Marines. The mission is to deter those interested in serving their country from enlisting in the Marine Corps. Don't support this anti-Marine Corps sentiment. Don't buy the book or a movie ticket.
2,Not for a station wagon,"Shipped by UPS, so I got it fast (three days). But wrong pipe for a 1985 Colony Park station wagon, but I made do. Drilled a hole in spare tire wheel well and made a bracket to clamp to it. This one fits only a sedan."
3,Buyer Beware...,"Buyer beware, this is the 7550 model or the 7400 model. The box says 7400 but the colors look like the 7550. It is NOT the 7850 model pictured. I should have clarified which 7000 series it was before buying. Regardless, this is still the best price on amazon right now for a 7000 series and I am happy with the quality of the toothbrush. It gives a wonderful gum massage and my teeth feel extra clean."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,I bought this product and used it about three times. Even after the very first time it started falling apart. After the third the brush came unattached from the handle. I think the company should of used stronger glue.
2,fake,"to anyone who's followed the series, this will be disappointing. This was written after death of Sax by someone who only glanced thru 1 or 2 books. Point: NEVER did Fu Manchu ever use snuff, nor did he ever ""cackle"" with laughter. Stick to originals"
4,Beautiful Show,"I have not seen this show, but after listening to it the whole way through, I want to very badly. The story is heartbreaking, and the music lends itself so well. At times it can be very spooky almost scary, and then other times as simplisticly beautiful as one could hope for. The music and lyrics are a bit repetitious, but this soundtrack tells the whole story. You can visualize everything going on. Its wonderful. I would suggest this to broadway collectors and just listners alike. Its also one that might be good for those who listen to books on tape, because you really do get the whole story, and it is stunningly beautiful. Favorite Song: ""I Wonder What's Inside"""
4,This is really great.,"I for one am not a christian, but i love this music!The lead singer can scream better than any guy otherthan maybe Corey off of Slipknot. I think Stil Breathingis up there with Coal Chamber as an overall band.thats my 2 cents"
2,just cause its a female singer doesnt mean they are great.,"in this day and age i'd like to think that we have established that men and women are equals.therefore, the standing of this band should not be elevated simply because they have a female singer. based on technical points such as the richness of vocals, creativeness in execution and over technical playing ability of the band as a whole i'd give them a 1. the singers voice is lacking depth or feeling. if you want a strong female vocalist look at archenemy or walls of jericho. next i'd like to point out that the playing skill of the musicians is anything but advanced. they meet only the bare minimum standard for being called a musician. they are the ramones of metal stuggling to find more than three chords. there are no intruiging time signature changes, multi faceted harmonies or polyrythyms. not a bad band... just not good."
5,The Bomb,"This book was the inspiration for my changing my undergraduate degree to political science. For a young person it is essential to understanding the world. What really struck me was the insights from Major General Smedley Butler, but you will have to read them yourself. It guided me to his pamphlet ""War is a Racket"", that I recommend everyone read. Someone stole my original copy so, it was imperative I get another."
1,"Pass by this book, there are much better out there.",Once again Ms. Trang has put out a cookbook that leaves much to be desired. The recipes are boring and uninspired and I feel that there are many better cookbooks of this type out there. Ms. Trang continues to pump out cookbooks instead of spending some time really learning the intricacies of food and working on her taste level.
3,Behind COMMUNISM,"The 7th Ed [103 pgs] is an extremely poor quality B/W reprint, some captions are so small it may require magnifier to read them. Most valuable information so I recommend used copies and previous printings if available. May also download online save to printing.A timely perusal of the Red Terror. Anyone who is interested in the history of Russia's transition from Christian to Soviet style government. Reality check and 'eye opener'!"
1,Compatibility Warning,"This battery is not compatible with the new Samsung Q1 Ultra UMPC, only with the older models."
5,After years of searching . . .,"this album is an album of uncompromising brillance. I first heard this album as a child. I recently located a tape I'd made of my mother's record album of Soulful Strings and wonder if I could find it. This is a must for any lover of music. Words can't describe what's on this album. Pure ecstasy for the ears and soul! It makes you feel good! I can't go on, I'm too excited . . . 5 Plus Stars!!!!!"
5,Magnificent!,"The music and musicianship on this magnificent cd is top drawer stuff. Get a copy by whatever means you can and lose yourself in the atmosphere it creates.Whether you're a soul fan, jazz fan or plain music fan there is something here for you!I first bought this album back in 1969 along with the Burning Spear/Within You, Without You single. Both are still high on my list of favourites.Why this album, or LP as we called them in those days, is not available on cd is a mystery. I'm sure that fans of Phil Upchurch, Ramsey Lewis, Young Holt Trio would flock to but it. Come on CADET, issue this and the first album, Paint It Black, NOW!I paid a lot for my cd but it is worth every penny.Buy it and share in my joy of music played with feeling and skill, but most of all feeling & soul!"
1,Cutting Board Disappointment,I purchased this board specifically because I wanted a board that would not move when used. I was very disappointed that it does not stay put on our granite counter top when I'm cutting foods. I am making arrangements to return the item.
3,Electric Fahey -- A Successful Album,"John Fahey finger-picking his way through a series of medleys, this time with a heavily-echoed electric guitar. Typical live Fahey, rambling, a bit rough at times, but enjoyable."
4,As expected,Very light weight and flimsy but that is what you get at this price point. Meets my needs. I wish I could find this style towel bar in a heavier construction but had to settle for these. Good value for price.
1,Proof- not just for mathematics,"There are a number of errors in this textbook, not just in the end-of-chapter review problems, but also in the chapter Examples that are meant to explain them. This does little to allow students to quickly and easily grasp the material.The writing style makes an interesting novel but a lousy textbook. Material is presented by giving an example, history and finally the scientific concept meant to be grasped. Makes for a great mystery, but this is science and a subject that scares students anyway. A concept given first is seldom followed by a thorough explanation. The effect is one of an author, who know his material really well, has no idea how to convey the basics to his readers and is trying hard to entertain. Combine this with the smattering of factual errors and this textbook is just annoying."
1,Can't Communicate Basic Ideas,"As a student using this text book right now, I have to say that I am completely frustrated with it. I'm an English major and am stuck with this class so I can graduate on time, so already I am not apt towards the material. What I can say that is complementary about this book is that is written quite nicely. Literally, the language is very good for a text book. Here's the downfall to that, I have no idea what the hell any of it is talking about. Pretty language aside, this book was clearly written by masters of their field, but there is no doubt in my mind that if they were college professors, they'd be the type that are clearly brainy and intelligent, but have no way of ""dumbing it down"" so to speak. This book is NOT suggested for beginners. Don't even bother."
3,Text for chemistry,Book was as described on site and you did a super job of getting it shipped in a very timely manner.
4,Just OK,A textbook is a textbook is a textbook. Some of the questions throw me for a loop because there is no explanation on how to resolve the answer. Whatev. It's required reading. Deal with it.
4,Great resource,"I ordered this book some years ago, and to this day I still refer to it to refresh with topics I vaguely recall. It provides a great summary of the basic accounting foundations."
5,A must buy! Highly recommended!,"The author should have been a college instructor. This book is used at our college in a required course. Teaches everything you need to know, makes you think, and teaches ALOT! Great explanations and examples!"
3,I-Net+ Certification For Dummies,"Although this is a good book, providing an excellent summary of what you need for the CompTia I-Net+ exam, do not depend on it totally. Both the time for the exam and the pass mark required was incorrect, though the author does urge the reader to keep up to date with such matters on the web. The section on HTML did not cover enough to answer the exam questions, and the development section was vague about client and server-side programming languages. Although I took 3 closed book practice exams provided by the CD-Rom, and averaged 85% in each, I failed the exam, getting a mere 70%. [The pass mark was 73%]. Maybe I am a Dummy, but I used the A+ sister Dummies book and got 84% and 85% for the Core and Dos/Windows real CompTia exams. So be careful. I would recommend studying at least two different books, [very hard], as I did, to do well in the I-Net+ exam. All that said, Dummies books in general, and this book in particular, are value for money."
4,Excellent Book (but might not be enough).,"As with as the Dummies certification books, the i-Net+ book is the easiest to read for this CompTIA certification, it's a great review of the subject, and it provides a general idea of the scope of the test. I've used Dummies to pass the MCSE, A+, Network+, and i-Net+ tests (the last at 90%, first try). The subect is covered well and the self-tests are good. However, though I usually start with Dummies books (or Exam Cram), I don't recommend them as the only book to use to study for a certification. Always get a more detailed book with another point of view to follow the Dummies series. A Sybex, Osborne, or New Riders book can provide the additional depth before testing."
1,Look somehwhere else,"Being a fan of past Dummies books when I thought of taking the INET+ exam this was the first publisher I thought of. I was so disappointed. The author makes several mistakes: 1. You do NOT have 2 hours to take the test...only 90 minutes. (page 24) 2. A grade or 70% will NOT pass...only a 73% or higher.(page 24) 3. The TCP port for FTP is NOT 20...it is 21, ANY veteran websurfer knows this. How about a mention of what port SMTP is on???(page 51)These are some of the most BASIC items concerning the test. There are areas with vague information (like VPNs and tunneling protocols). After taking the test (and passing) I can with all assurance say... Dont buy this book."
2,I thought this was a good book until I took the exam.,"Beware when an author incorretly reports the number of questions on the test (70, page 14 and 20), the time allowed for the exam (120 minutes, page 20) or the percentage required for a passing score (70, page 10). I found all of these statements to be wrong. While these may be insignificant issues, it does make one question the author's qualifications for writing this book. Do not believe the quote on page 23 about the actual test being easier than the practice tests. I did not take the test until I was scoring in the 90's on every practice test. The actual test was like reading a different language. I had read the book from cover-to-cover and worked through it a few more times, but was not prepared. Do not depend on this book to get you through the exam! Of course, this is just my opinion. Your experience may differ."
3,A decent review of the concepts,"I've avoided the ""Dummies"" series of books, but -- hey! -- it was on sale, so I thought I'd give it a shot.I began examination preparation feeling that I had the experience needed and was mostly ready, but just needed a little review to brush up. To this end, the book was successful. There were errors, as others have pointed out, but since I came into this not seeking new knowledge, but just to jog the forgotten details, it was entirely acceptable.It was quite readable, as well, and did quite well at not being dry.In a nutshell, a good review, but not so good a ""teach-me-how"" book."
3,great concept ....poor proofreading,"After reading, and studying the contents of this book, I did notice some glaring mistakes that even a beginner would pick up on. 1. winipcfg command was listed as win1pcfg which is a non existent command! 2. a few of the answers were incorrect as well, including the port for FTP which is 21 is listed as 20. And the mistakes follwed through to the supplementary CD-R. Ron Glister obviously put a lot of work into this book, but it is not worth a hill of beans IF the information contained within its binding is not 100% correct. My thought is that the proofreader of this book should be fired! There is a paragraph in the book that is some kind of stupid disclaimer, stating not to trust the contents of this book, and to use other resources as well for your final training for the test. I agree completly, as that is how I proceeded, and passed the test."
3,A great read with a fatal flaw,"I loved this book. I couldn't put it down.However, it had one horrible flaw:this is not a novel, it's just the middle of a story. Until now, all of Hobb's book had a real conclusion, and could be read as stand-alone novels. This one does not.It has no resolution. All of the strings are untied. It's as if Hobb hit 800 pages and said, ""OK, let's start on book three"".This is unacceptable.Also, this book continues the tradition of superfluous spoilers for the entire ""liveship trader"" series that started in ""Fool's Errand"".DO NOT READ THIS BOOK BEFORE YOU HAVE READ THE COMPLETE LIVESHIP TRILOGY."
4,Getting better,"I am happy to report that this book is far more interesting than book 1 of the Tawny Man series. The next book is fantastic. So, get through this and enjoy the final conclusive book."
2,Hard to take any of this too seriously; after all...,"...with character names such as Dutiful and Chivalry, Ms Hobbs' efforts are more suitable for the ""Barney-Goes-To Camelot"" generation than mature readers.Many years of reading, and for the first time a book gave me a headache. Ms Hobbs delvings into the incredibly boring minutiae of castle life without a whiff or two of something resembling action makes this a tedious read at best.Take a pass on these efforts and save yourself the expense of not only the book but the additional Excedrins necessary to complete the read."
4,Good,This book is great because it is driven not by just events but the turmoil and hardship of Fitz. The character of the fool is developed more as lord golden and fitz is dealing with a crppling loss during this. In all an excellent read
5,I love Robin Hobb,"Intrigue, plot and fantasy galore, the entire series never fails to be engrossing and fascinating. Magic, dragons, inner emotional turmoil, a dream world that becomes a part of reality through Fitz Chivalry's daughter Nettle and the skill, and a love between a Fool/mystical changer of the future and a man/wolf, and that man and his own wolf Nighteyes through a communication called the wit, make this wonderful reading for many.Sometimes the plot and ruminations of the characters become a bit too heavy handed and slow, but on the whole I love these books by Robin Hobb.Bravo!"
2,weird ingredients,"Be warned--if you don't live in LA or NYC, you probably will not be able to find the ingredients for 95% of the recipes in this book. Almost all of them require kombu, whatever that is. Other oddities include agar flakes, shiso leaves, dried arame, agave nectar, kaffir lime leaves, tamarind, maple crystals, jicama, spelt pasta and amaranth seeds. Maybe some ingredients could be substituted, for example regular rice vinegar instead of brown rice vinegar, regular radish instead of daikon radish, regular yams instead of garnet yams, regular molasses instead of pomegranate molasses and regular bulgur instead of medium-coarse bulgur ""found in Middle Eastern markets"". But what is the substitute for gluten flour? Or beet juice? Or umeboshi paste?"
2,Don't try this at home,"I read the enthusiatic reviews before buying this cookbook. I was disappointed. First of all, the recipes are very difficult and time-consuming. It would help to have a staff of kitchen help to do all the required prep. Secondly, the presentation is lacking. But the worst problem of all is the exotic ingredients called for. It seems that every other recipe requires ""kombu"" which is apparently some kind of seaweed. I searched high and low and checked out every oriental market in town, to no avail. Nobody knew what I was talking about! I still don't know what kombu is. Similarly, many other ingredients are generally unavailable. Maybe these things would be easier to find on the West Coast where there is a large Asian population, but you just can't get them in Texas.All that said, I did have some very delicious results on the ""Acorn Squash stuffed with sweet rice."" I only had to make a few substitutions..."
2,A great book if you have way too much time on your hand!,"This is a solid cookbook for vegans or anyone who would like to venture a little bit out of their ""ingredients comfort zone."" What I clearly did not like about this cookbook was that the recipes were very time consuming! Sometimes you even had to prepare some ingredients, like for example, Tofu Whip (another two-page, two-hour recipe), in order to make a small snack. While I love to cook even if it takes effort and time this book pushed me a bit over the edge.One final thing I thought was quite amusing was that the author claims in the introduction, that organic produce contains more vitamins than regular produce. While that might (or might not) be true it is slightly beside the point. I choose to eat organic food because of the things it DOES NOT contain (pesticides and the like) and because it saves our environment.Anyway, I would not recommend this book unless you don't mind spending hours on preparing these dishes."
2,"If you want to put a hole in your pocketbook, the ingredients these recipes call for would do nicely","I love cooking vegan food. I was looking forward to this book. But as a few other people have pointed out: preparation for making things in this book is extensive, the recipes call for exotic ingredients AND boy are those ingredients pricey. I would venture on calling this book ridiculous, but the recipes do look yummy -- I imgine they taste great. When I am retired and without children in the home and a millionaire I will get around to making something in this book."
3,"Real Food Daily Cookbook: Really Fresh, Really Good, Really Vegetarian","I was invited by amazon.com to review Ann Gentry's Real Food Daily Cookbook. It's vegetarian focus is on healthy, satisfying whole foods. After deliberating, however, there was only one recipe in the book I would have like to have tried: her vegan cheesecake with the added ingredient of miso. Unfortunately, I found most of the recipes ordinary and a lot were based on tempeh and seitan (with miso), none of which I eat. But, if there were a Real Food Daily in NJ I'm sure I'd try it for a healthy lunch. If you like a lot of tempeh and seitan with a Californian feel, I'm sure you'll find the book to your taste."
1,Unhealthy real food daily,"With recipes that are almost 100% very very high in fat, and often high in refined sweeteners as well, The Real Food Daily Cookbook is really unhealthy.This vegan cookbook is apparently looking to save cooking time in their restaurant and for cookbook buyers, but the ultra-high-fat road is not to anyone's advantage in terms of personal health. In addition, why are there almost no recipes for cooked leafy greens?? ...very sad. I am reminded of the former FDA commissioner's 2009 book on the food industry's goal of addicting customers to unhealthy foods: The end of overeating -- taking control of the insatiable American appetite, by David A. Kessler, MD. I have previously told my friends that from the standpoint of restaurants, the customer only has to live long enough to pay the bill and leave. ...This cookbook again proves my point. Caveat emptor."
5,Indispensible!,"full of delicious recipes that always work. Make sure to try the Pecan Pie, both the chocolate (wheat-free) and carrot cakes, the chocolate chip cookies (also wheat-free), the hummus (not innovative, but somehow the best ever), seitan ""chicken fingers"", ranch dressing, ""sour cream""...oh, so many good ones! One of my favorie vegan cookbooks."
5,not just for vegetarians,"I recently took a cooking class with Ann Gentry, and I was astonished at the savory flavors that she could create from a vegan menu. I fell in love with the spinach lasagna, and I can't wait to make it again. I would definatly recommend the cookbook to any of my friends, reguardless of if they are a vegetarian or not. Even my boyfriend loved the recipes that we created. Great job on the cookbook. I can't wait to try some more recipes!"
4,I think I will let them do the hard work at Real Food Daily!,"Ok,First, I am not a vegan, so that tells you how good this food is. Not a real tofu fan so I normally skip it and make the recipe without it.So, I am a huge fan of the Real Food Daily. I practically ate there everyday until I moved to New Jeresey (where nothing is healthy). I have missed eating there dearly so I bought the book. Of course the one recipe I really wanted is not even in there. They are almond jam cookies and they are to die for.The food is wonderful in this book. I made the burrito supreme and it rocked my world. The only thing is how time consuming these recipes are. I will continue to make the cilantro sauce because it was so yummy."
4,Yum,"I haven't yet made anything, but the reason I bought this cookbook was to find out how to make the tofu-based ""frosting"" that came with the cakes I had at the restaurant. This is a great looking book - the only thing I can say that would be difficult is finding some of the ingredients. I'm Asian myself, and some of this stuff I'm not even sure how the average person would find."
3,"Rash guard shirt does the job, but heavy for summer and takes long time to dry.","PROS: The shirt definitely protects you from the sun; fits much more comfortably than (i.e., not so constrictingly as) so many other swim shirts; and is stays on well and comfortably during casual swimming.CONS: Shirt is a somewhat heavier fabric than other ""swim"" shirts; when dry, you more quickly get hot in it on a summer day than you would in a T-shirt or some other, lighter swim shirts; and it takes a very long time to air-dry (the label says not to air dry in the sun, so on a mid-80's day in the shade with middling humidity, it took over two hours to air dry outside)."
2,not very well developed,"Star Risk, the first book in this series introduced a handful of characters that seemed to provide a good foundation for an entertaining space series.Unfortunately Scoundrel Worlds departed from what made the first Star Risk book interesting and glossed over much of the development in the plot. Good story lines, just not well executed.I was left with many why's in this book and it didn't seem to flow. The main characters seem to blend together and the story ended in a whimper.I hope Bunch goes back to the drawing board and reworks the plots to develop the characters and flesh out the battle scenes."
4,Helping Dancers to Understand Music,"I am using this book as a text in my Rhythmic Analysis class for dance majors at ULL. It has an accessible approach to learning about music, does not get too bogged down with music theory, and addresses issues particular to dancers. An excellent book, full of stimulating ideas to use in class."
1,no way,"I didn't like this book at all in any way. The title is really clever and the cover art is awesome. Aside from those two aspects, Confessions stinks."
4,"""Confessions"" Reads Like A Kubrick/Terrantino Plot","""The Confessions Of A Jilted Superstar"" By R. Martin Basso filps around like a pingpong ball. I didnt know where it was going or going to go. With all of the back & forth analysis and subject-matter twists I found a lot of what R. Martin Basso said to be real engaging. A simple way of putting it is that Basso seems to have absorbed the whole Stanley Kubrick style of stoty-development nicely. I think that's great. I guess I was sad that there was no ""happy ending"" but that's life I guess. ""Confessions"" is a true story apparantly and if Basso's live has gone like this, to date, then the whole ""no happy ending"" angle is just his reality. Sad, true and telling."
2,excuse me while i barf,"i didn't get it at toll, an all of you who says its so great can just blow me, beeyathch!"
1,Come on!! This guy knows nothing about Italian food!,"I don't know where you draw the line between Italian, Italian-American and American food. But this food cannot even be considered Italian-American. Cream with shrimp? Chicken stock and mustard in marinara sauce? Just because this guy is a mobster doesn't mean he knows anything about Italian food. It's sort of insulting to have such distortions proclaimed ""good, Italian food."" Try one of the many other cookbooks to find Italian or Italian-American food: Sopranos cookbook, Lidia's Italian-American, and others linked to them."
3,Charming but not comprehensive,"When I saw the title of this cookbook I couldn't resist buying it if only for the novelty of the thing. I imagine many of you reading this have the same reaction. The little stories with each recipe would have fit right in as scenes for ""Goodfellas"", but with one exception, the recipes are fairly standard Italian-American fare. The lone exception is the Ricotta-Rice Pudding which I find absolutely fabulous. I didn't know so much sugar could fit into one dessert! It's delicious!"
2,Not a recipe book,"Joseph Iannuzzi tells us, ""I learned the hard way. How to cook that is"". I don't doubt him much. Each recipe is accompanied by a narrative about what dish he served to which gangster. The stories are probably true, but I think you will find them weakly supsicious (author admits facts are rearranged at will to fit recipes). If you're looking for a novelty cookbook with some very good and very basic Italian recipes, this is your thing. If you are looking for a standard or definitive Italian cookbook... move on."
3,some good recipes here,"I haven't yet tried any of the recipes, but many of them sound good. I was especially intrigued by some of the dessert recipes, and there were even a few ""non Italian"" desserts in here."
5,Cooking On The Lam,"I've read and enjoyed all of Joe Iannuzzi's books. They've all been terrific, and this last effort ranks high on the ""gangster meter"".Although I haven't seen Joe ""Dogs"" but once in the past 22 years, we've been good friends since 1972, so naturally, I get a kick out of reading his stories -- I even included some others about him in my own book. Look it up. . . ""From The Piano Bench: Memorable Moments With Mobsters, Moguls, Movie Stars and More"" (Aslan Publishing).I suggest the reader buy Joe Iannuzzi's book for the fun of it, AND the recipes. Cinque stella. Molte buono!"
2,Not Italian at all,"Hi to all, I have to admit that I don`t own this book, I have just read the excerpt and I think I`ve had just enough. I have read the marinara sauce recipe and I`ve found things like garlic powder, chicken stock and mustard... believe me, never!!! Never in Italy anyway. I am Italian and I am very into cooking so believe me, you will never find such ingredients in any Italian home or restaurant. Maybe the stories in the book may be funny, but please don`t trust the recipes."
3,The Mafia Cooks,Joseph Iannuzzi tells a shorter version in this book of his life in the mafia.About meeting the one person who brought him into the life.And showed him the ways of it.About how much they enjoyed his cooking ability.He shares the recipes he made for them as they met.
3,Menus That Cannot Be Refused,"A wonderfully written piece. Ianuzzi is a bonefide MAFIA hitman now living in the Witness Protection Program. He intersperses delicious recipies while giving a personal account of his actual life in the mob. He names names and events. Thus one can appreciate what his life was like in the ""old days"" as a member of the Gambino family.The recipes, however, make for mouth watering reading. Moreover, they provide any number of ideas for one's own 'make-from-scratch' recipies. The recipies often are quick, simple, and relatively inexpensive to accomplish.A good, easy read."
4,Review on the Mafia Cook Book,"Everthing I have ever gotten from Amazon has been a hit. Especially, the quick & safe delivery. This book was fun to add to my Cook Book Collection. Thank you Amazon, for your great service."
1,there are superior Firm cardio videos out there,"I know I'm in the minority here. I'm an avid Firm fan but this video totally disappointed me. The cuing was untimely and the instruction was dismal. The transitions felt unnatural. The camera angles were confusing. The music was boring. I could not get the choreography. I tried to do this video several times and I could not figure it out, and I'm not a choreography klutz. If I had maybe one good thing to say about this video it might have motivated me to stick with it. However, I'm so frustrated that I gave up on it. I prefer Cardio Sculpt Blaster, Calorie Killer and Express Cardio which are easier to follow and/or have better music."
4,Good change of pace for Firm tape users,"I like this workout for when you just want a good aerobic workout without weights or strength training (I suppose you could add light weights if you wanted; no one on the video uses them). This video has fast-paced & upbeat music, a little tricky choreography at first, and is definately a challenging workout for an intermediate exerciser. I use the Transfirmer system without any problems instead of the system shown on the box. Lisa Kay gives good cues and is perky enough to keep you going but not annoying. My one complaint is that they don't do a good job of showing the low impact alternative (Libby). Several times she wasn't shown until after several repetitions of the movement. You can't see her for much of the workout because she is off to the side. All in all it is a good workout video."
5,Always impressed by the Firm,I am always impressed with the firm.. They're the first video to give the directions backwards. (when they say left they are actually going right in the video) I find this easier to follow.. This video is good for people just starting to workout as well as advanced. you will need the firm box to complete this Dvd.
2,Good gracious!,When I bought this I considered myself to be in pretty good shape but I cannot keep up. The steps are incredibly hard to follow. I gave up after a couple of attempts.
3,"Good workout, but complicated....","I have at least 15 Firm videos and all of the step work is a little hard to remember at first, but this video is very difficult. I thought that the cuing was off a bit and it was difficult to hear her as well. It definitely gets your heart rate going but I don't care for this video in regards to the stepping. VERY COMPLICATED, difficult to master and a bit discouraging in comparison with other firm videos that target cardio."
4,Pretty good...,"This is an intense workout, surprising considering how short it is. You will definitely get your heart rate up and work the whole body. HOWEVER, I was disappointed in a few things. I love the Firm, but with this workout, the cues were TERRIBLE. I've been doing step for years and am good at advanced choreography, even teaching it at the gym for a few years, but this wasn't good. She would say, ""Five repeaters,"" and do 6, throwing you off completely. She would start and stop on the wrong legs, say ""repeater right,"" only to mean repeaters on the right side of the box with the left leg. Huh? Very confusing choreography. But you can still get a good workout if you just keep moving and try to pick back up.I'm only giving this 4 stars because it is intense, even if the cues and choreography are sub-par."
4,Excellent for diabetic nerve tingling and pain,This product is excellent for the pain and tingling caused by diabetic neuropathy. I have had diabetic neuropathy for five years. I have used this for the past two years. This product does help. It can also be found in the diabetic supply section at WalMart for a cheaper price. It is where I first found it. I use BioFreeze also. Another excellent product. This product has a more budget friendly price than BioFreeze. I would wholeheartedly recommend both products for neuropathy pain and discomfort.
3,Could have been better,I picked up this book after having read MacLaren's Bride thinking to give the author a chance to redeem herself. I was in for a rude awakening. This book was just as bad. The heroine in both books were such wimps. Here you have a gorgeous man listening to you and telling you that he loves you despite how poorly you have treated him and all they can do is be too afraid to allow their hearts to rule their lives. If not for the hero in the books they wouldn't even rate 3 stars. These are men who have had problems in their lives but aren't afraid to take the chance at being happy.
4,a better translation is coming!,"Save your money for the new translations, which at least in the first two volumes (Swann's Way and In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower) are far superior to Scott-Montcrief's and also superior to Kilmartin's reworking of it. The Modern Library Six-Pack may be more accurate than those earlier versions, but it is still essentialy Scott-Montcrief decked out with an improved translation of the final volume (S-M died before completing his work). Just as every generation deserves a new dictionary and a new translation of Homer, we deserve a new Proust. What Lydia Davis has accomplished in the 2004 Swann's way, and James Grieve in Young Girls in Flower, suggests that ""our"" Proust is at hand. -- Dan Ford"
4,How do you assign stars to this opus?,"This was my project for 2010 and it took me most of the year to do it (although I read one every other month, so as not to become hypnotized). There's nothing I can or should add to the very insightful and learned commentary about this work, instead I just want to say that I liked this particular edition very much. I found the quality of the books themselves to be very high for the price. I loved that you could put the books down on their spines and they would remain gracefully open. And they all just felt good to hold -- an important quality if you're going to spend 4,300 pages with a book.My only complaint (and it's my own fault) is that I didn't realize that the last volume contained the much-needed Cast of Characters until I got to it. Do yourself a favor and have vol. 6 with you as you read vols. 1-5."
2,Kindle book inadequate,"This bundled Kindle edition is not indexed, which means that searching within the book is not possible. I had previously borrowed Book 1 as an individual volume and found that it was searchable, so I do not understand why the bundled version does not also have this feature. In a text of this length and complexity, a search function would be very useful."
2,Celebration of '70's Mediocrity,"This is the last time I buy anything off of Amazon before reading the reviews. Even all the raving reviews reveal the premise of this production. Rob Zombie movie? I don't get it. Too bad for me I got this order, though.The best characterization is my first impression out of the case: 70's trucker nuckleheads with a Nashville sound. But its usually not that good. If you thought the 70's were bad, try this parody. Despite occassional decent picking, it's too unfunny tongue in cheek, and I put it in the corner of my shelf of things to get rid of."
4,Fun CD,"This CD makes me wanna dance, laugh, and party. Thanks for 6 amazing years in the '70s, Banjo & Sullivan!"
1,Garbage,"Worked well for about a year... and by well, I mean better than a $10 FM transmitter but not nearly well enough to justify the $150 I paid for it. Good idea... bad implementation. Then, after a year... it just ceased to function at all."
1,Great idea -- too bad it doesn't work!,"Just tried to install this in my 2001 Chevy Silverado. Took some trial and error to figure out where to install the control knob. Almost couldn't find a place for it -- so think ahead!Then, I pulled the factory stereo and determined that even though my stereo has an ""AUX"" feature, there are no standard inputs on the back for my to plug this unit into.Okay, I figure I'll just use the wireless FM transmitter function. WRONG! Static on every channel setting that I try. The static would be more or less intense based on where I moved the base unit, but it was always there. Also, if the base unit moved even an inch it could change the signal quality from ""a little bit of static"" to ""complete static"". I'm guessing that the unit is defective, but I'm not going to try out another.Thumbs down for me."
2,Sound quality sucks,"I bought, installed it - after getting Nissan antenna adapter in addition to the FM adapter that came free with its purchase.After all that - it looks nice... but sound is substandard compared to CD. No it cannot be iPod problem. It cannot be result of compression. I buy through iTunes to burn on CDs. I don't know what else could that be.I am about to rip it off from my dashboard and return it back to best buy. The only hezitaion is that I spent so much time and effort on installing the damn thing."
2,Unadaptable,"After the technician at Circuit City had installed the HK Drive & Play, he told me that there will probably be some ""static"" in the sound due to the nature of the ""FM frequency modulator"" conection. WHAT??? Why would I replace my perfect sounding cassette deck adapter with this static laden interface system???? The tech then told me that my car did not accept the hard wire adapter which would be sold separately anyway. My advice to everyone is to make VERY sure that the current sound system in your car will readily accept the ala carte adapter necessary to ""hard wire"" this interface. I am thoroughly disgusted."
1,Highly disappointed,The product cost me 35.00 and would cost me over a 100.00 to install. I thought it was ridiculous to spend more then three times to install. Now it is costing me 13.00 to return the product.I will never buy a product through a private buyer on Amazon
2,RIP OFF,"This product was advertised as NEW on Amazon and when I received it, it was already opened, and the items inside of the box were open. The only thing that was new or unopened was the instruction manual. I had the product installed into my car at Bestbuy and the product kept making a clicking sound whenever I played music from my IPOD. I was told that a part (power box?) was defective and had to order a new part. Sometimes when a price seems too good to be true, it is..."
1,was good while it lasted,"it was a quick and easy install and i was extremely impressed with how intuitive the controls were. i go to school in boston and visit home frequently in new york so i figured this would help on those long drives to and from school. i was home for the weekend and wired it up on the day i was going back to school. it lasted about 2 hours with no problems, then the controller completely stopped recognizing my ipod. my ipod said it was connected and it was able to charge, but the display would say it was disconnected. i thought for 30$ this was a steal, but i guess you really do get what you pay for."
5,Excellent product,Great item - works great EVEN WITH FM MODULATION if you know what you are doing. spare yourself the grief and shell out the $10 for the In line modulation kit if you don't have inputs. It can work with the 3g ipone with a separate in-line item from $co$che.
1,Drive+Play -- Extremely susceptible to voltage drops,"The advertising for this product says it is compatible with all vehicles. I would not recommend buying this product unless you have spoken with Harmen Kardon first on compatibility and checked the voltage output of the car power source you are attaching it to.I attempted to install in a '97 Jaguar XK8, and the unit would switch on and then go dead. Harmen Kardon Tech Support stated that this is a symptom of the car voltage dropping below 11.5 volts. The voltage of the car checked out fine, and the unit worked through the cigar lighter in another car. It seems that the unit is extremely sensitive to voltage and will not work effectively in all cases because of this (an internet search revealed others with similar problems).Shame as it looked like a nice product, but clearly not compatible with all vehicles, and a one star rating partly due to the unhelpfulness of Tech Support."
1,Bad experience,I was really ecstatic when I bought the Harmon Kardon DP 1US Drive and Play in-vehicle interface and controller for my husband. Setting it up with the FM option was a breeze. A few minutes later the display stopped working. There were a series of horizontal lines and eventually the display characters seemed to disappear. I had to return it for a refund as my husband was disappointed and preferred to get a different gift. It may work better for others but we had a bad experience with it.
2,Poor customer service and a shabby product to boot,This is a great idea in theory. Unfortunately it doesn't completely work as stated. Everything works fine except for one flaw that makes it an annoyance. There's no problem when I connect my iPOD through the connector and the user interface is pretty straight forward. The problem lies in the quality of the sound that comes out. I haven't tried using the FM transmitter so I cannot comment on that aspect. I do have an auxiliary jack in my car which produces crystal like sound when directly connected to my iPOD. Now when I connect the auxiliary cord from the car to the module that relays all the information from your iPOD it produces a static sound that is very noticeable and progressively gets worse as the iPOD remains connected. I contacted Harman Kardon to see if there was anything they could do and I have yet to hear back from them. Therefore I cannot recommend this product to anyone. Poor customer service and a shabby product to boot.
4,I really liked it...,It worked great for 6 months and then the control knob started working intermittently. This problem started after having some work done on my car which required disconnecting the car battery.Best Buy looked it over and couldn't find a problem (they installed it). They installers mentioned that other customers had similar problems. In any case--sending in the unit to get looked at.If this problem hadn't occurred--I would have given 5 stars.
3,Flawed but Hey It's the Only Act in Town,"It's weird with lots of nutty things, like it forgets the playlist you're in after a awhile, it forgets your settings if you unplug the ipod, it won't display a song unless it's assigned an album name, etc. etc. But this unit and it's newer brother (which is also weird) are the only acts in town for an external ipod controller for the car. I get the feeling HK outsourced the design of the unit to an overseas company and the engineers there had never used an ipod and spent minimal time in the planning process. Most of the weird glitches are no more than firmware mistakes that should have not gotten through."
1,"To put it bluntly, this just plain STUNK!","This was (in my opinion) a true dud. In fact, I thought it was the worst stooges' dvd ever. All they had was ""Hollywood on parade"", ""Knife of the party"", ""Henry the ache"" (which I thought was really a stinkbomb). Then we have ""Disorder in the court"", which is a ton better. That was the only good one on this dvd. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I wish they'd release some true classics to dvd like ""Pardon my scotch"", ""Movie Maniacs"", and ""A Pain in the pullman""!"
3,Analysis combined with Short History,"To clarify - if 3 1/2 stars were available that is where my gut would have put this book. Whilst this book serves a good historical perspective of the evolution of information age warfare in US Government and Civil Agencies (and in particular the DoD) it left me a tad disappointed. The author definitely, as highlighted in other reviews, makes some extremely pertinent points (nuggets is probably an apt description) on the future of war how it may be fought he perhaps doesn't pursue these as far as I would have hoped and I was left with the impression that the book, whilst an interesting and easy read, was unnecessarily 'padded' out with historical examples. This aside, it is easy to criticise, and I wish to note that Chapter 12 dealing with assassination in the information age is a particulary good discussion."
4,interesting and accurate,"Even though a few years have passed since it was written, the subject is more relevant than ever. The author presents the material in a unique way to show you how we got to where we are and keeps it entertaining. As a Captain in the Army, this gave me a better understanding of the thoughts and actions of our senior leaders at the strategic level but also gave me some ideas of how emerging threats could effect us at the tactical level. I didn't agree with 100 percent of it but the overall arguments were solid."
3,Warning: Mastering Bugs!,"June 2001: The Eisenstein box set from Criterion is based on new transfers but has serious problems with the mastering. If you have a progressive DVD player or a line doubler you will not be able to get a picture free of motion artifacts since the pulldown on the discs is screwed up many times. In addition it seems the Nevsky disc has footage before digital restoration instead of after, a bizarre mix up. Wait for a remastered version."
5,EXCELLENT TRANSTER FOR AN EARLY CRITERION RELEASE.,"EXCELLENT TRANSTER FOR AN EARLY CRITERION RELEASE.I DOUBT CRITERION USED DIFFERENT PICTURE QUALITY FOR EISENSTEIN'S WORKS.IF NOT MY MISTAKE, I'M SURE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IVAN THE TERRIBLE BE PUBLISHED IN HIGH DEFINITION, AND UNCUT VERSION ALL OVER THE WORLD.THE CHAPTERS SWITCH AND COMMENTARIES ARE REALLY PRECIOUS AND RARE. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED."
2,Cute but very hard to put on!,Very hard clasp to close- nearly lost the earrings twice- they are cute but beware!
2,Linksys HPN100: a little slow,"The 1Mb/s transfer rate over POTS (phone line) is a little slow, and internet sharing crawls. The built-in ethernet port is nice, if you can run the cables."
2,Beautiful illustrations salvage so-so writing,"The colors and images of this book are marvelous. Simply gorgeous. They will prompt people to pick up this book, turn the pages, and buy it. The writing, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The poems are trite and obvious. If this series is to continue, I hope the publisher keeps the gifted illustrator and dumps the ho-hum writer."
5,Lovely to own for new baby :),"I bought this for my daughter's new baby...she loves it and finds it very handy when visiting or shopping too.I'd highly recommended this product...wish I'd had one for my little ones...I even love the name : ""Moses Basket"", don't you ?(It's a nice, clean place to have for your baby in doctor's waiting room too!)"
2,Terrible color!,"The quality of this basket is not bad. However, the one I received is orange! There is no ""honey"" color about it. And the ""ecru"" bedding that came with it has multi-colored polka dots on the sides. It is such an awful combination, I am returning it immediately. I expected color variation from staining/dying a natural fiber, but orange is a little extreme for me. I'm hoping a natural color one will be okay."
4,fine for the price,"As others have mentioned, the bedding is very flimsy and poorly stitched -- I had to re-sew all the ribbons and part of the fitted sheet after laundering. The fitted sheet is kind of loose and could probably use a new elastic. The fabric is as thin as can be. The basket itself seems sturdy and has been very useful. It looks nicer in person than online. I haven't been able to find any sheets online or in stores, so when the baby spits up I have to wash and dry the one sheet before I can use it again, which isn't super convenient."
3,I've seen better,"I had a moses basket when I was raising my children; now that I am becoming a grandmother, I wanted to get one for my daughter. Although the basket, itself, is very nice, the hood is not so good. It attaches with velcro and does not appear to be quite the right size/shape. The lining is easily removable, making washing it easy, which I do like; however, the ""bumper"" is very thin (almost nonexistant). I wish I could comment on the mattress and fitted sheet for the mattress (supposedly included), but I didn't receive them. Hopefully, I can get them sent to me; otherwise, I will have to fashion some kind of padding myself as nobody, especially a little baby, would be comfortable in this basket without something."
1,Moses basket,I looked good but the hood was damaged in shipment. I returned it and purchased it elsewhere.
3,Beautiful Basket But....,"This basket is very beautiful. However, the wood seems to be splintering in some places. I need to really go over in and inspect it thoroughly again but, at this point I'd feel a little nervous putting a child in it. The basket is exactly as pictured and the seller shipped it promptly. I just am not sure if I should have expected some splintering from this type of sleeper or not. I thought that since it was supposed to be for infants that it would meet certain basic guidelines."
4,I like it.,"It is good for laying your baby in when you're somewhere a bassinet isn't available. The velcro on it is annoying, but other than that it is nice. It serves its purpose, and when the baby is to big for it, you can use it as a laundry basket."
4,Works great,"Honey Hooded Baby Moses Basket. This works great for carrying my granddaughter around the house, she also prefers to sleep in this little Moses carrier. I do agree with earlier reviews, the ties could be better and there could be more of them to prevent the side pads from handing down. Other than those issues that are easily fixed, it's a great product for the price."
3,"decent, for the price","i loved the photo of this basket- and thought the honey color was very pretty. unfortunately, when it arrived, the honey is very red and the canopy over the basket caused the entire basket to bow out when attached. altogether, not the most sturdy moses basket i've seen, but for the money it made a cute and creative way to wrap a bunch of small baby gifts and will be a cute decoration, if nothing else."
4,Moses Supposes His Toes-es are Roses...,"You cannot beat the price for the price. Be warned that the top cover is velcroed to the bottom basket. If you are picky, you might need to look elsewhere. But we are satisfied with the quality in relation to the cost."
4,Great Value for a great product,"I wanted a Moses basket to take with me to parents house when we visit. My daughter sleeps well in the basket. The basket is tightly woven and very appealing. I didn't give it 5 stars due the hood is attached with velcro, making it less appealing. I would like it better if the hood was woven on. This is a great value for $29.99. Check around and you will not find a quality Moses basket for less."
3,Worth $30,"I had been using a small basket to carry my baby around my house, but she outgrew it, so I started looking at Moses baskets as a replacement. I was hesitant to order an expensive basket online without being able to examine it, so I decided to get this once since if it didn't work out I would only be throwing away thirty dollars. The basket has decent padding along the bottom, and pretty much looks just like its picture. The sun hood sticks on with velcro, which is visible but holds the hood fairly solid. The basket is somewhat floppy and deforms easily. Overall, I have found it very suitable for its purpose and feel that it has been worth the thirty dollars I paid for it."
5,Great buy!,"I have a two story house and bought this basket so I didn't have to run up and down the stairs all day to check on my napping newborn. It is fabulous! I keep it downstairs so my son can be in the kitchen or family room with me. He sleeps very comfortably in it, it looks great, and the price was right. An extra bonus--my daughter can use it for her dolls when my son outgrows it! I would definitely recommend this product."
4,A GREAT SONG EXCEPT I DON'T KNOW GERMAN,"It had a great beat and Ricky looks like Vanessa Williams. The only problem is that I don't speak German so the song wasn't as wonderful as it could be in English. I didn't know what they were saying but judging from the music video the guy Laura breaks up w/ then starts to date Ricky (this all happens during the video) and then the guy dumps Ricky so they both try to make his like miserable (and start by...kicking over his scotter...Ooooooooookkkkkkkkkkkkkkk...) Well, I suggest this CD, but mostly to people who know some German or at least know what the title of this song means (somebody please tell me...not only am i stuggling w/ the title of this song but also with about 12 titles to Enrique Iglesias song...please help me)"
2,Stunningly weird.,"The story of the Findhorn Garden is somewhat like that of Lourdes or Old Faithful--I don't know exactly how to describe it, but it is by turns hyperreligious, extraterrestrial, down-to-earth, and just plain bizarre.The woman of the house talks to the spirits of plants, and they tell her how to plant them (sort of an interactive Burpee service), and they grow in sand and fertilizer, blooming in extraordinary abundance where there was nothing but an ugly, abused mobile-home park once.While this is a 1960's tale, there is much to be admired about it, and much to ponder as to what on earth does this indeed represent?"
5,"For Ideas Only, Not a How-To","This is an excellent book if you want ideas on possible window treatments for almost any type of window. I was delightfully surprised to see all kinds of unusual shaped/styled windows. Many of the window styles are not covered in most window books (Arched, Cathedral, Celerestory, Portholes, Bay, Bowed, you name it and it's probably in here). If you are a decorator, have sewing skills to be able to construct from a picture or can hire someone who can, this is a wonderful book.If you need step by step instructions on making curtains, I would still recommend having this book as a resource and picking up a different book on how to make curtains."
4,1001 Ideas for Windows,"Most books about curtains are primarily geared toward teaching the reader how to make the curtains. For those people like myself, who aren't interested in making the curtains and just want some ideas on how to decorate their windows, this book is ideal. The author has many different suggestions (including curtains, draperies, blinds) for every type of window and even for french doors."
4,jumbo adjustable wrench,"A huge, heavy wrench. Not the quality of a top brand for a professional mechanic, but plenty good for a casual do-it-your-selfer. It has huge capacity and plenty of leverage. Not to mention that it's a fraction of the cost of a professional tool, which was the determing factor for me. I wanted a bigger, longer adjustable wrench than my current 12-inchers.Pros: Big capacity and long handle for extra leverage.Con: I reduced the rating because the adjustment screw was rough and little jerky. It does work, though, with a little jiggling and some oil on the screw."
4,Im happy with it.,I bought this for christmas for my zeppelin obsessed boyfriend who recently started playing guitar. Even though this book is really advanced and he wont be able to play it for a while. Its a good book to set a goal to. Its really detailed and kinda awesome. He loved it. :) im happy.
1,Not performed by various artists !!!,"I just reviewed the samples and see it's performed by Walter Chancelor jr. he's ok. but the music is watered down just like his tribute to Earth, Wind & Fire and what's misleading is it says various artists so you'd expect some of the top sax players in smooth jazz, but it's just him and a handful of musicians on other instruments. So if you want a good smooth jazz tribute to Luther then purchase Forever, For Always For Luther at least they actually have various artists performing, but this album NOT!!!!! and I really mean NOT!!!!!"
2,not so much,I'd rather hear luther any day. this is so watered down....was givin to me as a gift and i should have returned it
1,Not Pleased,"Simply stated,I was not pleased. I thought this was a compilation of various artists as well. I was disappointed. I really ordered the wrong album. I wished I had read the comments before I purchased. This is probably best suited to be used as bedtime sleeping music only."
4,Great book and good history,"I loved this book. It has been a while since I read the Deryni series and this was a great refresher. It was very interesting to take a peek into the earlier histories of all the characters. The book delivered exactly what it said it would, a look back. A definite must read."
5,In The King's Service by Katherine Kurtz,What a great book for anyone who reads the Deryni series. The book arrived promptly and in excellent condition.
3,Less than should be expected of Kurtz,"In the King's ServiceChilde MorganWhile these books introduce us to the early lives of King Kelson, Alaric Morgan and Duncan McClain, they don't have the level of intrigue that make her Camberian and Deryni cycle of books so good. There is some intrigue but it very minor to the story.If you are a big fan of Katherine Kurtz, as I am, these books are worth adding to your library if only to provide background to her grand drama."
2,Where's the magic?,"My review will echo several others here in that I am a huge Katherine Kurtz fan and this novel was a disappointment for me. The world that Kurtz created and we loved that involved the first two trilogies centering around Saint Camber and then King Kelson Haldane were delights to read. Reading this book was equivalent to reading ""The Crossroads of Twilight"" from Robert Jordan from a dedicated fan's perspective. The use of magic in the book is muted and mainly revolved around the psychic dimension of the Deryni powers. I will read the reviews of the next book before buying."
3,Give it a miss!,"I don't know why Ms. Kurtz wrote this book---it doesn't give any new information or interesting sidelights to the Deryni series. She raises a few questions, but the answers turn out to be meaningless... For example, there is a question about Alaric Morgan's true parentage, but then it turns out that he is fathered by just the man we would've assumed anyway--his mother's husband, named Morgan, is his true father.This book does answer the question of how Duncan and Alaric are related through their mothers, but in such a way that the informaton is almost meaningless.If you love the series, by all means read the book. If this is your first Deryni book--read another one, because this is not representative of the series!"
3,Disappointing. . .,"This one book has enough material for a trilogy. As it is, Kurtz--bless her heart--is trying to cram the maximum amount of story into the allotted number of pages, and it shows.There are so many plot points and characterizations that scream for more development that it would take too long to enumerate them here.I wish Kurtz could have talked her publisher into a trilogy."
2,It needs an update or Supertopo needs to write one.,"This guide might tell you what's there but you'll have to figure out the rest. The topos are vague and the drawings are not very useful. Compared to the Supertopo books, the Falcon guides are useless. Unfortunately Supertopo only covers the South Lake area and neglects Donner."
3,Topos are tiny and hard to read,"If you're over 40, I'd be surprised if you could make out the tiny print on the topos in this book. The text is very small and very difficult to read. There also is no ***** system recommending quality routes. Try to search out the old guide book with larger and more readable topos."
1,This is not wide angle adpter ring.,"I ordered 86mm wide angle adapter ring from Amazon, since no other sellers have Lee wide angle adapter ring for 86mm.This was not the wide angle adapter ring but the regular adapter.Do not order this one if you want wide angle adapter ring."
5,Works great on my 17-40mm on FF,"Bought this Century Optics 77mm Wide Angle Adapter for the Lee filter system after hearing it's the same as the Lee branded ones. I can confirm, it works perfectly with my Lee foundation kit and actually came in a Lee branded box. Also, I wanted to add that there is no vignetting at all at 17mm on a full frame 35mm format (17-40L on a 5D). I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about, this is a wide angle adapter and it works perfectly."
2,Tepid...,"I was excited when I bought Edith Layton's latest historical ""To Tempt a Bride,"" but after finishing it I can't help but wonder where the ""tempting"" comes in? Eric Ford has apparently been in love with Camille, his friend's sister, for a long time; but his struggles with malaria and the ten year age difference over her, stop him from showing Camille his feelings for her. Ok, that sounds like a romance, but the problem with this book was the lack of chemistry between the protagonists. If Eric is in love, and Camille feels the same, I expected love scenes, longing, or something to indicate how they felt. There was none of that, and the fact that I had to wait until almost the end for a sex scene did not help matters. The story seems more about the relationship Camille develops with the mysterious Nell, than a romance. If you like tepid regencies, ""To Tempt a Bride"" is for you, but if you are looking for a good romance, skip this one."
2,Padded Rehash of False Angel,"As an avid fan of Layton's for years, I was really looking forward to this novel but it was a disappointment. It was a longer and less interesting version of False Angel, an earlier novel which I can wholeheartedly recommend."
2,What happened to the ending? Bad editing or just lazy?,"I read this book over the weekend. The storyline was ok, though I think this series may have run its course. The editing was terrible.I was really disappointed at the end of this book. I am wondering if they had published a draft version instead of the final version. One page has a 'Insert Techno' sentence, meaning they intended to describe some tech information, but never put it in.There were also several starts at storylines that just ended. Several hints that Tomboy was on the russian carrier for some reason didn't go anywhere.The worst part was that the end of the book as two badly conflicting sections. In one section, Tombstone lands on the ship after being shot up. In the other section, he sees Tomboy's russian bomber shotdown. It was very confusing. I think he was trying to work the Tomboy character into the book, then left for vacation without finishing.Not his best work."
3,getting back on track but not there yet.,"It's definitely better than the last 2 or 3. The editing isn't as sloppy although it still needs improvement. Like the last few in the series there are some important plot lines that never got resolved (did they discover the bug in the fire control computer, whose missile hit the cruise liner, what's a sponge, what happened in the UN, what happened to the trigger happy Russian commander?) and it ended sort of abruptly. The air battle started on cue but for no apparent reason and the character development was superficial this time. The Tomboy bit was confusing. But it was still fun to read."
2,What happened to the story???,"I have read most of the books in this series and have rather enjoyed them. But how did we go from an unfortunate series of events that led to the sinking of an American cruise ship by either a Russian or American missile, to the rest of the story? The book attempts to find out whose missile actually hit the ship, then drops it. Why did the Americans all of a sudden want Pamela Drake to steal the crystal from the Russian laser, and for what reason? How improbable is it that Tomboy would be on the Russian ship, then ejecting from a Russian bomber with no further development. Then the President appears out of nowhere on the carrier to present Ms. Drake with a metal(book's spelling), for what??? Not a really coherent plot for the last third of the book."
2,one-time use,the mascara by itself did not work for me but i suppose it might work if u use it over your regular mascara. i didn't think the color was strong enough.
4,A rare find...,"I bought this CD for my husband, as we love Michael Buble and heard a duet with Jane and thought it was lovely. She has such a clear voice on this CD, it is heavenly and fantastic quality. We have bought a few new Artist's CD's this month and she ranks as one of the best. Would definitely buy another CD. If you like classical jazz with the sweetest of voices, then you have found your treasure..."
4,Dazzling Strong Voice,"I had never heard of Jane Monheit until recently; she was strongly recommended by a friend whose taste I trust. I was not disappointed; Ms. Monheit has a voice that is assured and strong. In fact, at times she has the power and perfect pitch of Barbra Streisand. One can tell that she loves what she sings, and her choice of material is excellent. The only reason that I did not give her five stars is that her phrasing and pronunciation distract from her otherwise fine performance. For example, ""Dancing in the Dark"" and ""Over the Rainbow"" are beautifully sung; however, they suffer from strange phrasing and pronunciation that had the unfortunate effect of shattering the spell of her hypnotic voice. I look forward to future releases from this dazzling singer."
4,Another great CD from Ms. Monheit,"Overall, this is a solid contribution to the portfolio of Ms. Monheit. She once again shows some diversity in her selections and uses her incredible voice and talent to stir listeners. Her duet with Michael Buble is incredible. Their mesh their styles wonderfully.If you are a fan of Jane Monheit, I recommend adding this CD to your collection. If you are new to Ms. Monheit, I would recommend buying ""Come Dream with Me"" first."
2,Billie Holiday??? Ella Fitzgerald???? Whaaaaat????,"Despite having a beautiful, God-given voice, this girl has problems and they are all of them readily evident in this CD.First of all, she sounds NOTHING like Lady or Ella. NOTHING!! Which is fine, but she and others need to stop making this comparison.Secondly, she is most definately NOT a jazz styled singer. She is a pop singer who does standards. If you want to know how a jazz singer sounds, check out Paula West, Dianne Reeves or Allan Harris.Third, as Stephen Holden FINALLY pointed out in the NY Times, Monheit has problems when she sings songs she cannot connect with. This is her biggest problem.Finally, the cd is more often than not flat and uninteresting. And as for Mr. Buble, I shudder to think that people have been conned into thinking HE is anything more than a below average wanna-be Sinatra."
1,"Awful, awful, awful","It has become apparent that Ms. Monheit doesn't have enough of a voice to do ballads, and this CD is mostly ballads.The first cut is a jazzy little riff, and it's quite nice. But the album quickly goes downhill.Save your money. Or spend it on Stacey Kent, who is what Ms. Monheit aspires to be."
5,R_Urdiales,"If I would hear an angel, I think will sound like the voice of Jane Monheit. I really enjoyed the CD, best the romantic songs: In the still of the night my favorite."
3,Whereto now Jane?,"Jane's first album was a winner, both in terms of program selection and performance. The second album was disappointing as far as program selection is concerned, as was the third and to a lesser extent, her latest album. She has so much to offer but does not seem to be able to match the success of her first album. Nevertheless a fine voice and techique. One could only hope for ""a less commercial"" fifth album."
2,Should not be classified as Jazz,"Jane Monheit has a beautiful voice but to classify her in the jazz catagory is a stretch. There are 3, maybe 4 songs on this entire CD that are jazz. The rest is.....something else, I don't know what. Her songs with Christian McBride, Lewis Nash, Kenny Washington, and Ron Carter were great. I believe you should stick to one style of music per CD. As a Jazz Lover, this was not a good buy for me."
1,SHE NEVER TAKES A CHANCE,"BORING! Every Monheit Show & CD I have seen & heard is boring and she sings every tune, every show exactly the same; same notes, same non-commital way of singing. She sounds well rehearsed. She does sings in pitch and is breath-takingly drop deap gorgeous! But her CDs are simply boring. I think there is a real market for jazz singers that sing the standards and sing them fairly melodically straight and Jane fufills that need. However there are tons of under-publicized jazz vocalists that are heads and shoulders above her. Try buying TERI THORNTON (the first place competition winner; jane was second)! Mary Stallings is a goddess! Neenna Freelon, Paula West, Carla Cook, Rene Marie and so many others. Monheit is the Britney Spears of jazz. Take a chance and buy someone that is not so publicized. You will be surprised."
2,I just can't take the hype....,"anymore. The more this pretty girl with the pretty voice is gilded as the next Ella, Sarah, Norah, Billie--whatever--the less remarkable she seems. She is bland. I actually laid our some cash to see her live. Lively, pretty--but the constant brushing her hair out of her face (get a clip, Jane) and pouty facial expressions reminded me of a child acting out burlesque. It was a cartoon. I would have laughed out loud if I hadn't been so queasy at the sight. Now she has big $$ behind her and the relentless hype goes on and on. She is perfectly fine--but she is not, by any means, what she is made out to be."
2,Nothing new - no new thoughts or insights,This was not anything I haven't read before on the subject. here were no new insights. It was inexpensive so I am not complaining but I would not recommend the book to a friend.
4,I needed it,"Thanks for writing this book. I saw a lot of our relationship in the things you have written and over the past six months our sex life has improved dramatically thanks to the knowledge you have shared and the other book we bought, 500 Lovemaking Tips and Secrets which really made it a lot more fun and interesting for us."
1,not very helpful,"Ok, look, if you are the high libido partner, and your goal is to get sympathy and understanding, acknowledgment of your needs and relief from your loneliness and hurt feelings of rejection, read this book and hope for mercy sex.If you are the low libido partner who loves her spouse, you probably feel bad enough about the situation anyway. You are being told to get your act together or else head for disaster. ""Desire is really a decision. You have to decide to make having a vibrant, exciting emotionally satisfying sexual relationship a priority"", and ""just do it!"", the author writes. The good old 'Fake it till you make it' approach. Really?If you want your low libido partner to feel passionate about you again, readRekindle your Love Life and Reignite your Relationship: A Practical Plan for People in a Low-Sex/No-Sex Relationship or Marriage.HereThe Sex-Starved Marriage: Boosting Your Marriage Libido: A Couple's Guideyou mainly learn how to keep a bunch of therapists in business."
1,Absolutely useless!!!,"I read both this book and its carbon copy, Rekindling Desire by Barry McCarthy, hoping to find some help for my own low-/no-sex marriage, and found absolutely none at all. They did not even begin to address my situation. They deal strictly with sexual techniques and completely avoid the deeper relational and emotional issues that drive couples, like me and my wife, apart. I would not recommend these books to anyone."
3,Didn't describe us,"I wouldn't recommend this book if you and your spouse are in a good relationship but want to improve your sex life. It is meant for distressed couples, or at least couples where one member is distressed. Neither my husband nor I could relate to the marriages/people described in the book. Weiner-Davis gives a nod to couples like us and suggests that it will be good for us too, but we didn't find much that applied to us. Given that most of the information from couples comes from her counseling experience, the direction is going to be skewed toward what is going on in the homes of unhappy couples. I'd like to hear from couples who are weathering this challenge, looking for and finding solutions without experiencing the high level of distress which shows up in this book. It's probably a pretty good book for the couples it is really intended for. So I gave it 3 stars."
1,Sex Starved Marriage is one sided,"If you're willing to buy into the myth that sex fixes everything, then, this book is for you. Best of luck to anyone out there starving for more than ""the act"" whose spouse or significant other picks up this book. Good read for a laugh."
4,Answers for me...,"It's nice to have a book that addresses BOTH sides of the issue. So many other books I've consulted speak only to the partner with the lower desire. It may not be a perfect book, but it gives a more balanced approach than much of the other books that attempt to speak to the disparities in sexual desire.This is a good starting place for a discussion between the partners in a relationship struggling with differences in their needs for physical intimacy."
5,Flying high on two wings,From two sisters who are renowned in the Australian music industry comes this fine showcase of their vocal talents. The CD includes songs by many well known Australian songwriters such as the unbeatable Paul Kelly. It is an uplifting and magnificent album with a blues and gospel tinge to many of the songs. Listen to this CD every morning if you want to start your day right.
5,amazing!,"I first heard this during the wind down of a yoga class and was mesmerized. my yoga teacher said she had looked for years before finding this CD, which truly captures the vibrations of bells. I love it because of the vibrations it creates in me and the never ending quality of the tones. Get it today; I am ordering several more for my sons and friends!"
3,"It's good, but . . .","Don't get me wrong, this is a very well-written book, but I found it vaguely troubling that it seems to have nothing to do with the other books in the series. And I'm not talking about the choppy chronology of the Trillium books . . . that I can overlook . . . what bothers me is that Andre Norton chose only to write about Kadiya. I've always thought the appeal to this series lies in the three fiercely different sisters. Haramis is my favorite, so I was disapointed that in the whole book she was barely mentioned. You'll love this book if Kadiya is your favorite triplet, but as a continuing chronicle of the princesses' story, it fails."
1,Muddy,"I loved Black Trillium, and found Blood Trillium a worthy, if darker, sequel, but reading Golden Trillium only reveals what a thorough editing job May and Bradley must have done on Norton's text while writing the first novel. The story is vague, and the language impenetrable. I forced myself to finish it, but didn't pick up much. For Norton fans only."
2,"Readable, but I wish I'd known. . .","I have to admit I've read better books than this. It was better than Black Trillium, which I found practically nauseating, but I read through Golden Trillium only because I kept thinking the plot would pick up a little. It never did-- at least not until the very end, where a novel's worth of conflict is squeezed into about two chapters.If you managed to plow your way through Golden Trillium and/or Black Trillium, read Marion Zimmer Bradley's Lady of the Trillium--it's infinitely better. If you haven't read Golden Trillium yet, do yourself a favor and check it out of the library, so you won't feel cheated."
4,This Book was very Intriguing.,"I loved this book...in fact, it is the book that took me the shortest time to read, in all the the series. But somehow it is the only one of the series so far, that is anticlimactic. I found No discrenpancies. However the story could have had a lot more to offer. Maybe more emphasis on the guy from Varm...more interaction from the 2 forces prior to the last 20 pages.....that is the only thing that disapponted me about the book"
2,Dissapointed about the cd,When I start preparing for a MS exam I always buy a Dummies book. I used the For Dummies when I did the 70-098 and 70-210 exams so I bought this title without looking at the reviews.This book by itself would not have given me a passing score. There is nothing about Active Directory or Group policies in this book and I had quite a few questions on the exam about these subjects. The book did give me some good info and is good to start of with.Biggest dissapointment is the cd. Almost an exact copy of the 70-210 cd with a few extra questions. It hardly had questions related on the book.I just bought 70-216 and 70-217 from the dummies series because I think they deliver superb reading material.
3,A good place to start but not a 1-stop shop,"I found this book to be a very good place to start but DON'T rely on this book alone to get you through the exam! There are several areas (e.g. Active Directory & Subnetting) that were not covered in the book yet these appear on the exam and others that are not covered in anything like enough detail. Also, while the test questions on the CD are a good way of checking your knowledge of the topics covered in the book they don't really prepare you for the questions you will meet on the exam. For this, I recommend using 3rd party (e.g. selftestsoftware etc.)."
4,Quick way to get the concept.,This book can bring you to understand easily and quickly. You no need to read a very large article to get the meaning.
3,Fascinating cultural and historical insights.,"Although there is substantial dialogue, this book almost reads like a biography of Liang Shi-yi, with cultural and historical gems thrown in. The best parts (I think) are in the author's description of common life which are virtually unknown to westerners (like the acquisition of various wives and concubines). The plot can get bogged down in detail at times, but at other times, the detail provides amusing insight into the life of a Chinese leader."
2,Where's the coconut?,This tea tastes more like spiced tea rather than coconut. Try CS vanilla maple if you crave an excellent tea.
5,"Fabulous & Healthy, Too","My favorite tea, and my only tea. Two tea bags easily makes a full quart. To this I add a heaping teaspoon of xylitol, which is a healthy and alkalizing sweetener.I especially like that this tea is caffeine free and features rooibos tea. Rooibos tea is as healthy as green tea, I've read, and it's far more palatable when combined with these delicious spices.I see one reader didn't like the coconut flavoring. Fair enough, but I recommend you try buying one box locally and deciding for yourself. I like everything about the flavor, as do many others who rated the tea. And the prices offered here can't be beat."
1,"I didn't get it by june 5, so I DON'T KNOW","MAYBE THE PRODUCT IS OK, BUT THE ONE WHO SHOULD MAILED ME THESE ITEMS IS NOT OK."
5,Fashion at an affordable price.,I love the earrings! Gem Avenue is a great seller. Wonderful quality/fast service. The earrings were exactly as the picture.
4,Must Read...rather must own,"I guess that having read the reviews before I bought this book; it is totally worth it. So I wont repeat what everyone has said, but everything that they said is true! It is truly an amazing book and a must have before you travel anywhere.I give it 4 stars though for poor editing. The maps are wrong in places ... cant forgive that. Also it needs a severe update as far as contemporary work goes to include work by HDM, Holl et al. The author can and should also attempt a book on buildings in Europe & Asia. Will be great to have all volumes as a repertoire of the best architecture around."
2,Worthless index maps,"I'm not sure who put the map index together, but they must've been dyslexic. The numbers on the maps hardly coorespond with the correct page numbers of the building. I spent over 2 hours ""correcting"" the book, in order to make my cross-country road trip a little more efficient.Do not buy this book until they release a 3rd ""corrected"" edition... ...unless ""correcting books"" is your cup-of-tea."
5,Great for meat preparation!,"I use my polypropylene board for meat preparation since it is dishwasher safe. I have been known to ruin small wood chopping boards by putting them in the dishwasher. They eventually warp and I have to toss them. So, this saves me money in the long run and makes me feel good as it can be put in the dishwasher. This board is large enough for all meat preparation.~The Rebecca Review"
2,another piece of trash,"It totally boggles my mind at other reviews and what some people consider good to great. This by far is one of the worst in the Buddah Bar products. A couple of nice pieces but otherwise an uneven, noisy, even just horrible at times c.d. If I could i would return it. Buy Siddhartha 1 and 2 also Buddah Bar 1, instead. Do not waste money on it."
4,love them,if your a poas addict like me.. and everyone else TTC then these are great for the price! they do give some nasty evaps at times but when i used them with my first pregnancy i got my BFP plain as day! i would/have recommended this product to dozens of my ttc buddies!
2,Generic pregnancy tests,"I do not like these tests because they have an evaporation line. Since they are high-sensitive tests, they may display a faint line, especially if you test before your AF. However, it is so hard to distinguish the test line from an evaporation line.Even though I kept a time frame, this test left me guessing. In my opinion, there are better quality tests which are not expensive as well. I will not buy them again."
5,>>**SHIPS FROM CANADA**<<,"I bought these about 2 years ago, and again about 3 weeks ago. I'm a pleased, repeat customer. The tests are NO MESS, easy to use, and easy to read...and yes, they work great. However, I can't remember how soon the test reads positive (I think it's about 3 days before the period is due).The little cyphen that comes with each test can be placed close to your body while peeing, and it will collect the urine just fine with no splatter. No need for cups at all.My only frustration is that these >>**SHIP FROM CANADA*<<, so it took about 12 days to receive them (I live in UT). The seller shipped them within 24 hours of my order, so the seller is great to work with. I will always buy all my tests from this company because the product is great and a GREAT price for the quality."
2,Not Satisfied with the Delayed Detection,"I wasn't crazy about these pregnancy tests. They did not detect my pregnancy soon enough for my satisfaction. I bought them for comparison purposes, along with another set of ""early"" tests. These tests were not detecting my pregnancy until a full 7 days after the other tests detected it. These tests are okay for comparison purposes if you don't mind delayed detection. However I recomend the other tests I bought for earlier detection and more accurate results. Here is the link to that product: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FYGQ5I/ref=ox_ya_os_product"
5,very good conditions thank you,the book is in very good condition it looks like new and I am very happy because I save almost $100 from buying a new one from school.
3,Managerial Accounting,Book I need for this course. Came in right on time even though we havent used it other than for example problems for the exam.
3,Fairly basic,This is a fairly basic text. I liked the emphasis on how accounting can alter employee incentives. I wish certain subjects such as other cost accounting methods had been covered in greater depth. Frequently the text recommended consulting other text books.
1,The Book Sucks,This books was not helpful at all. I was so confused that I actually had to drop the course.
4,It is what it is,"The vinyl/plastic is soft enough to make it easy to work with but I found the 3/32"" bulb to be perhaps a bit wider than my original sweep and had to struggle quite a bit to get it to insert into my shower door. Finding parts for old doors is rather difficult and I was able to make this work reasonably well for my need but it would be nice if CRL offered a greater range of dimensions. No major complaints about it but I wasn't delighted with the product either."
5,Just what I needed - though expensive and hard to find,"Glad to have found this product online, as it is hard to find elsewhere. Think the product price along with the shipping fee is a little expensive. Nonetheless, I received the product ( I ordered two this time around) from the shipper in new condition and in a timely manner."
3,This Is Personal....,"""Night Train"" is one of those tunes that you could just listen to forever and not get tired of it. The other cuts, in my opinion, are not nearly as strong as the title, hence the three stars(""Night Train"" by itself rates off the charts). Personally, I think no other version of ""Night Train"" even touches this one, even James Brown's(which is saying something)."
4,Not exactly,"I really would have liked a better rendition, but since this was the only thing available, it's ok. I am still waiting for Harlem Nocturne to be found. The 50's music I cherish."
3,Tony Tryschka Book,"Good songs except not really for beginners. Wait until you know the three basic rolls (i.e., alternate, forward, and forward reverse)."
3,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!,"This album has some good spots. Cieto Lindo is great. In fact, I first herd Cieto LIndo,(Brubeck's same version from this album)on a compilation, thinking the album that the song came from was great since the song was, I was rather disaponted. The album has some great streight ahead 4/4 jazz tunes, but compared to some other Brubeck albums, this album, I thought was boring. This album's all right, but lacks some great 5/4 or 7/4 tunes that made Brubeck famous. It just doesn't live up to Time Out, Time Further Out, or the concert At Carnigie Hall."
3,Not great.,"I purchased this based on their great track on the John Fahey tribute album ""I Am the Resurrection"". There was nothing here as good as this or as good as other recent work in the same vein...such as M Ward."
1,As cheap as the price implies,"The quality of the cable leaves a lot to be desired. So much, in fact, that it broke after the first time I used it. For $14 I wasn't expecting the best cable release ever, but this is still inexcusably bad. The plus side is, it only took three minutes on the phone with Adorama Camera to get a full refund for my cable release. Kudos to the people at Adorama Camera for being easy to work with, but I would definitely look elsewhere for a shutter release."
1,Sleepless,I would like to have known that this sleep mask is not soft or pliable and cannot mold to my face. It has cardboard inside and is stiff. The strap is also too long so the leftover Velcro gets stuck in my hair. Would not recommend.
3,Very Narrow Strap,I have used several sleep masks from this company over the years. This one is very thin compared to the others though it seems to do a good enough job blocking light. My biggest complaint is the elastic strap to hold it in place is very narrow. There is also very little adjustment for the length. As the strap stretches it will soon become unusable. I will have to try to find the model I bought before.
3,K&N INTAKE,"purchased this for my 03 silverado 2500hd..I wasnt crazy about it, it was just ok. seemed cheaply designed and made which suprized me because ive always bought K&N. On the heat shield there is a rubber trim that goes around it seems like it would be better if it was curved to fit correctly instead of just straight, looked a mess was coming off and hard to keep on. Gasket that went on tube to connect to the intake manifold looked cheap like it was just made out of the same stuff as like a rubber belt. Also the directions said you may have to trim your fan shroud to make the tube fit and that wasnt happening so I decided to go with the Volent intake and it was bad a$$ check it out I am very happy with it. Looks cool and does what its supposed to do."
4,Good Product,"Got the kit and went through the install process. I purchased the entire kit to include the air intake tube. It is tight to get the tube to clear the fan but it does, barely. I have been using it for a couple weeks know and all is working good. I do tow a trailer and it does seem to make a difference. Gas mileage has gone up about 1 mi/gal."
4,Great pagan music!,"A must have album if you celebrate the Wheel of the Year. I love Lisa Thiel's voice, it is rich and full. A pagan classic."
1,Does not work with all Medela pumps!,The product description says that it works with all pumps but it does not work with the Medela Freestyle pump. It says so in the box. Amazon returned the cost of the items plus shipping but it was still a waste of time to have placed the order.
5,Better than the two-piece shields,"The *best* part about these is that milk NEVER collects in the tubing when I use these with the Pump In Style Advanced. When I use the two-piece ones, I always end up cleaning the tubing, which is a total pain. Saving myself that headache makes these totally worth it. As long as you rinse them well, I don't see how they are more difficult to clean than the two-piece ones."
3,"IT'S ONLY ONE...if you need a pair of them, order TWO","OK I guess I should have figured it out but I didn't think too hard about it...I wanted an extra SET of complete shields, the product description mentions keeping an extra SET at work, so my brain assumed this was a SET of shields. Nope, it's ONE SHIELD assembly. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime so I get free shipping; doesn't matter too much to me that I need to order another one, it will get here in 2 days with Prime. But BUYER BEWARE...this is just the listing for ONE SHIELD.Also...I found out when I tried to use them after I ordered a second one...this does not come with the little connecter that attaches the tubes to the shield, so if you need an extra set of everything, this won't help you."
5,Different sizes?,Is this available in other sizes? I would love to order a size large but can't seem to find it available anywhere
1,Didn't work,This valve did not work on my medela breast pump (i have the dual pump). i didn't return it because i was going to have to buy as much for the shipping as i did for the pump. don't buy here. just go to a brick and mortar store (like target) to purchase. it's not amazon's fault... it's the supplier's issue.
2,Skip the one piece and buy them separate,"I had numerous lactations consultants tell me (after I purchased this) to buy the medela breast pump accessories in pieces versus this one piece. When you buy them in the 2 piece, it's easier to clean and if you go up a size like I did from a 24 to 27, then you can still use part of this accessory. Also, if you even stay the same 24 size but realize you want to try the soft flange or the slanted flange, you can't reuse this one piece."
1,Doesn't work with Freestyle!!,"I really don't understand why Medela insists on including these multi-piece valves with their pumps, and was really happy to see that there was an alternative - even though it's sold separately of course. But in tiny print on the box it says they are not compatible with the Freestyle pump!!"
4,Check the pricing on the kits,"I have about 6 sets of shields so that I don't have to wash/sanitze more than once a day. I built this up incrementally.I never seem to end up buying these one pieces. Every time I want to, I look up the accessory kits, and those come with two one-piece shields/etc like this, but end up being less expensive. They may come with bottles that I don't really need, but that doesn't hurt me.Anyway, if you want to buy 2 of these, I can't promise that there's an accessory kit out there with 2 of these that's cheaper, but at least poke around to see if the currently pricing on any of the medela accessory kits makes it a better buy. It always has been for me."
2,ok as a spare,only problem is that it does not come apart like the others I have. That way they are easier to clean etc.
5,Did the job ok,came when promised and was exactly like the company said which made it nice to not worry about how it would perform
1,La Catrina will be the laughing stock of your classroom!,This is the absolute worst excuse for a video/worsheet combo I have ever seen. The entire project is so bad that its funny. I would actually like to have these videos just to laugh at them they are SO bad.
5,Beautiful and full of originality!,"Listening to this wonderful cd just once is out of the question, once you listen you crave the beautiful sounds that are sang so beautifully throughout the whole cd. The best thing about it, it all comes truly from the heart and and is sung from the soul. You couldn't ask anything more from such a talented person, it's truly a wonder why the whole world hasn't had the oppurtunity to hear such a wonderful and beautiful sound!"
4,"A good book about Skylab, America's first space station","I hope this book returns to print sometime. It is a history of the Skylab space stationprogram. It discusses in detail the experiences of the astronauts who called Skylab homefor months at a time, and the experiments they performed. I hope that the people whodesigned the International Space Station read this book, because it talks a lot about howdifferent types of people (scientists versus pilots) reacted to different aspect ofliving in a gravity-free environment and how people coped with the various problemsassociated with space station life."
3,Pop Culture Vultures,"Written with a kind of respect that a college graduate would use to reminisce about his grade school cronies, ""Precious and Few"" is a walk down Memory Lane in Pro-Keds sneakers. The authors churn up quite a few of the Me Decade's most interesting pop singles (from 1970 - 75 only) and group them in various ways, such as pop religious songs and hard rock, a category that these two wholeheartedly admit to enjoying in their younger years. The authors know their material well enough, and though they often treat it with irreverence and sophomoric smugness, some might argue that the music from this era deserves nothing more or less. This book should find itself a place next to any 1970s K-Tel eight-track collection, Pet Rock, or black lite poster, and since it is no longer embarrassing to admit that 70s music is uncool, this book might be a good primer for anyone who can hum the chorus of ""Billy, Don't Be a Hero."""
4,A time trip,"Perhaps the teenagers of today perceive the music of the 70's as one, indivisible universe. But for those who were teenagers at the time (like me) there is a clear division between the first and the second half. This book is about the first half. Those were the days before punk rock and fabricated disco music. It was a time of innocence and fun, the years of the first Beatles solo albums, progressive rock, glam rock and silly, harmless, disposable singles. For people like me, this book is a trip down memory lane - I, like the Breithaupt brothers, also discovered my passion for music in 1971. But it also provides invaluable reference about those formative years of what turned out to be a ""classic"" decade for pop music."
5,A Look at the First Half of the 70's,"Canadian brothers Don & Jeff Breithaupt examine the first five years of the 70's music scene in Precious & Few. Each chapter is broken up to cover a certain type of music like bubblegum or examine a particular group like The Rolling Stones. The chapter heading lists essential songs from the subject. The brothers interject personal accounts into the stories that make for a nice touch. The book is a quick, easy and completely enjoyable read."
3,"Amusing, irreverant","Well-written and frequently hilarious take on an astonishingly narrow musical genre: Pop music in the 1971-75 period. Written by Canadians, which has both its pluses (they know how to write) and minuses (a chapter on Canadian pop music? Puhleese!). Will be of most interest to those born between roughly 1957 and 1963. An easy read, and an amusing one, but best to borrow this one from the library or buy it used."
5,"Effective, well made, surprisingly lovely.","Polypropylene cutting boards are the way to go: they are easy on your knife, they are easy to wash (hand or dishwasher), and the food doesn't slip around. But I am delighted to report that this one is better than most.The 3 rubberized feet do a great job of preventing slippage, freeing up your second hand from holding the board in place. The round shape works really well: oblong boards are often too long in one direction and too short in the other direction. And, to my surprise, it's a really good-looking object: the size and proportion are just right, and I actually like to leave it sitting out. Well done, Trudeau. I'd definitely buy it again."
2,cutting board,The gray bumpers fell off after a couple of months cycling through the dishwasher. They were the things that made the board non-skid. I was disappointed in the product.
3,Not quite the same with Wimmer handling the art chores,"I will readily concede that it's certainly a difficult chore producing a daily comics strip and that joint efforts and ghost writers and artists are the norm in this artform.That being said, Rose is Rose is not quite what it used to be now that Mr. Wimmer has become involved."
5,Fantastic y maravilloso!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hi, ok, i just wanted to first say thanks to John H. for writing his review because that helped me make the final decision of buying ""Polen""> it is one of the best cds EVER!!!!!!!!!! Me encanta! Lynda es una super buena cantante con mucho talento. Todas sus canciones son muy poderosas y magnificas. I don't have a favorite song, they're all amazing!! I was wondering if anyone had the lyric to her songs. cuz like theyre not included and that made me angry becuase i dont see why they cant put them in. anyways the awesomeness of the cd makes up for the lack of lyrics. ..."
3,Sticky,The lube part sure works and does so for a long time but when it dries on the skin it does leave a sticky feel that has to be rinsed off. Odor is neutral.
5,Great lubricant :),I always use lubricant with toys and with my husband and this is a very good one.The price for the size of the bottle is very affordable.
5,Just what mama needed! Thank you Santa!,"If your wife or girlfriend likes a stiff one up the arse every now and then, this product is for you! This stuff is so slick that the typical ""loosening up"", or tossing of the salad if you prefer, is just a quick formality, because even if you're endowed like a horse, once everything is properly lubed, there ain't nothing that's going to stop you from hitting rock bottom. Slammin!"
2,Failure to Last,"I went with ID Glide anticipating that it would be a longer lasting water-based lubricant, but after the initial stages of sex, it was drying up and I could feel the friction increasing. I would have to reapply more or add water, both of which ruin the thrill of the moment.I ended up using quite a bit of the bottle just after a week of having sex with my wife, and it didn't seem very economical for me to continue using this product.From the other reviews, it seems that this product is great, but if you're seeking longer sex and don't want have to deal with the hassle of reapplication of any kind, consider other alternatives."
3,Does The Job!,"Kinda sticky. And not in a good way. It also doesn't last as long as I'd hopped but that may just be me.On the plus side it's cheap, doesn't stink or irritate myself or my girlfriend. Now, I irritate my girlfriend but this lube doesn't;)"
5,Good Product,"As a sensual lubricant, ID Glide is much better than KY jelly. ID Glide is more slippery, has a better consistency, lasts longer, costs much less, is oderless, and has only a very faint sweet taste. The dispenser works very well too."
4,works well,"This stuff was a bit thinner than old lube I've used. Only second tube I've tried though, and it is water based, so it's supposed to be kinda thin right? Just thinner than my previous bottle, and I enjoyed the thicker stuff more. Good product though."
4,Good stuff,"Great lube, but it gets very sticky after a while and defeats the purpose. I wish it lasted longer and wasn't so messy, but it gets the job done. Price is not bad either."
5,Great Lubricant,"Well the lubricant is cheap, effective and and comes in good quantities there is not much more to say about it, according to me is fine."
3,Left yucky stickiness,"It was OK going on, but left my hands feeling disgustingly sticky and gooky. As well as everywhere else it went, ultimately. Also, between the labels and reviews calling it ""long-lasting"" I had somewhat higher expectations. It didn't dry instantly, but didn't last remarkably long either. Maybe a few minutes. Shame the bottle is so huge, I don't think I could stand the stickiness long enough to finish it."
2,Dries out too fast,It felt really cold on the skin. It just does not conduct body temp as well as silicone. Then it dried out and felt sticky and not in a good way.
1,Dries quickly and leaves sticky residue,My partner and I used this lubricant on multiple occasions and the first several times it seemed fine and lasted as long as we wanted it to but recently it seems to dry very quickly and becomes very sticky and useless far too soon. I will not be buying this product again.
3,"Fun for 5-10 minutes, sticky after that.",As a lubricant this stuff is very good for about 5-10 minutes. As it dries it gets sticky and uncomfortable and you look forward to washing it off. It is very slippery and fun but in my case I found that I was de-sensitized by it's use after about 5 minutes and it made it hard to reach a climax. I don't have a great deal of experience with lubricants so perhaps these results are not surprising.I may buy this item again but not before trying a number of others first.
3,Good stuff,"ID glide was the first lube we purchased few years ago and always thought it was great. Goes on a kind of thick, stays slick, and is relatively easy to clean up. It was doing the job well so we never really bothered to try other lubes until recently. Each brand has its pros and cons, but by comparison we found ID glide to be harder to clean up than the others. It's consistency actually prevents some of the sensation you get from a ""thinner"" lube, but it does stay slick for a long time. I would probably give it 3.5 stars if I could because you can't be its price per ounce."
3,Satisfied customer,"have only used this product for 7 to 10 days, purchased late in the season and satisfied up to this point"
2,Misprint in the Guide,This guide should be a must for any Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist of the Roses enthusiast. It has a list of the decks that are available at the start of the game and also list most of the cards that your opponents have. It also provides a list of all the cards available in the game. The biggest disappointment with this Guide is the image quality of the cards as they are very pixelated. There is also a mistake with one of the cards that labels the card as one thing and but shows the image of another card. I wonder how official this guide really is?
2,short shrifted,i thought this would be a great combo pack for my 3 month old son but it's more like an introductory trial product rather than full versions of media
5,Delivery was very fast,Product was fresh and arrived fast. Packed w/ice tightly to prevent crushing during transportation. I was quite surprised at how when I received the package. THANK YOU!!!
2,"Nice for one person, not for two. Leaky wing nuts...","This is great for one person. It pours straight down over the top of your head nice and smooth. The adjustable arm can swing up and down so you can have the right height. The wing nuts also let you adjust the angle of the head. But! you can't angle it side to side at all. So mine hung a little crooked, closer to the wall. The only way to adjust this is to tighten or loosen the actual thread part on the wall, which is no solution. I also found that adjusting the wing nuts when the shower is on, leads to water spraying up at the ceiling.Another note... I'm not always a single person shower type. I might have company, therefore they are left out in the cold. I'm trading this model in for the wall mount aquascape by the same company instead.If you shower alone and don't change your water direction much. This is for you."
4,Dependable,"I have only had this product installed for a few days, but it seems to be working fine with no issues. I have never used another rainfall shower head, so I do not know what kind of experience I should be having. There is enough pressure to keep the clean feeling while maintaining the soft feeling of rain."
2,A year old and ready to replace,"The showerhead gives a lovely shower of water... when the arms can manage to hold the showerhead up, that is. Fortunately I'm short enough that it's never hit me in the head, but I sometimes fear for my (taller) husband. From the reviews it sounds like it's pretty hit and miss with this product: either the arms work, or they don't. So just keep your seller's return policy handy. If it weren't for the problem with the arms I'd be very happy with this showerhead."
1,Never got the item,"Unfortunately, I cannot review this item though I did order it. I was sent the WaterPik RPB 173 instead. I took the box I was shipped to my daughters house, which is out of town, and to my surprise it was the wrong item. I installed the RPB 173, it leaked like a sive and was a total waste of my time and money. Next time I will order from a vendor other than DrillSPot."
5,Milton's poetry as inspired invocation in crisis,This book takes a fresh look at Milton's lifelong creation of poetry as a divinely inspired response to personal situations of crisis -- a pattern similar to and informed by the poetic invocations of the Psalms of the Old Testament and the Confessions of Saint Augustine.
5,A Senior Review,"At almost 62 years of age, I wasn't sure that this book would be of any assistance -- I hadn't worked out in some time, and had aches that made me nervous about trying a fitness program. However, I got immediately engaged, involved, and found that the book spoke to me and my needs perfectly. There is so much information, presented so clearly, that targets everyone. I'm now moving more easily, and most importantly, looking forward to moving, for a change."
3,Great for Beginners But Intermediate and Advance Folks Look Elsewhere,"I am a big fan of Gregory's holistic approach to fitness; his interpretation of mind, body, and spirit or soul whichever one floats your fancy.I think you do have to incorporate all the elements of fitness, good nutrition, but also the MIND, the Infinte Powerful tool that many of us think we are subject to, however in Truth we are in control of our Minds. I bought the book knowing these prinicples and they defintely reinforced, however came away with the thought that this book is more for beginners.Intermediate and advance who are honest with themselves already know most of the information contained herein. If you want to incorporate more mental toughness into your workout there are a few pointers here, or I recommend any of the ""new thought"" books from the likes of Ernest Holmes."
3,Great martial arts moves.,"Upon looking at the book, I was struck by the fitness I.Q section.This is a great tool for many beginner exercisers.It gives you an idea of who you are, and at the same time there is the self affirmation aspect.I feel that there is something powerful about knowing yourself-it is the beginning of greatness.Gregory has a section in the book that deals iwth ""Cleaning your body of toxins"".Recently, I've been paying attention to this phenomenon and I was impressed by Gregory's knowledge.How many people for example know that toxins in the body contribute to gallstones, headaches, depression,abscess and constipation?I found this to be amazing, in the sense that we have soo many pharmaceutical products out there, that are meant to treat these conditions....while a simple solution would involve getting rid of toxins in the body.last but not least,I fell in love with the martial arts exercises that he has in the book.My clients love them!, thank you Gregory!!"
5,GREAT and long . . .,This is a great all-in-one DVD. We have many showed DVR'd but to have them on a DVD together makes long car rides much better :) It was worth the price (I got it for a bit more at Target) since the story keeps playing and my Little One very happy :)
3,Wubbzy's Big Movie,"The episodes in this film are:Puddle MuddleA Tired Tail*Pirate TreasureCome Spy with MeA Tale of TailsPerfecto PartyMonster Madness*The two that are marked with an asterisk are not on previous DVDs. Five of the seven are on other DVDs. If you've already purchased previous DVDs, you may want to skip purchasing this one."
4,Perfect for toddlers,my twins love wow wow and this dvd is perfect they ask just about every morning to watch it.....great buy
1,100% Complete waste of money and time!,"My actual rating would be 0 stars or avoid! Without repeating the problems stated in the other reviews, I experienced them all. I tried installing this software on two desktop computers and a laptop, all extreamly high end hardware. The program behaved the same on all - TERRIBLY. There are most likely no perfect programs, but this one from Broderbund sould not be on the market."
1,A Complete Waste of Money,"I bought this program with the hopes to be able to take my hobby of home design, etc from paper to computer. I thought that I would try this program, especially since it was inexpensive. I was very pleased the first time or two that I used the program, but after that, the program began to freeze, give me illegal operations and shut down my computer. I have a relatively new computer with a very good video card, so I know that it is not the hardware. It has to be the program. At this point, I cannot even run the program on my computer. As soon as I open the program and go to begin a project, my computer freezes up. At least before I could get half my project done before it froze up on me. I do not recommend this product to anyone. If you want to purchase a similar program, spend the extra few dollars and get one that you can use."
1,Disappointed with product!,"I was very disappointed with the capabilities of this software. If you seriously want to design or remodel your home, I suggest purchasing something else."
1,Horrible Product,"Don't buy this. Impossible to install more than the garden cd. The rest won't install. My son bought one, and he can't get it installed, and I bought one, and I can only get the garden cd to install. I only found this site, trying to get tech help to install this miserable product. Tech help, isn't at the address given in the support guide. I have been trying to install it for 3 hours, and no luck yet. DON'T BUY IT. Installation, should be a snap, not with this product."
1,This Program [stinks]!!!,"I only give it one star because if you do not have 32 ram to get the better program it is acceptable. But it is slow, hard to decorate because you have to take a photo of anything not in the first picture you take. Not only that it kicks you off and you end up losing all of the work you did. Very frustrating, do not buy this unless you do not have 32 ram or more. ..."
5,Awesome Software,"I am somewhat surprised after reading some of the reviews on this product. I have used this program for about two years now and about six months ago, my husband and I finally created our dream home. It is really easy to use. My computer is about five years old and I've never had a problem with the program. I do suggest, though, that before you purchase this program/software, be sure it's compatible with your computer.Needless to say, I would definitely recommend this product... ENJOY!!!"
1,Bad Program,"I've tried to use this program on a PC running Windows 98SE. The system has 384 Mb of RAM, 12Gig Hard Drive, 500 Mhrtz and each time I've loaded this program and built a plan, I was either unable to save it or, after saving it, was unable to reaccess it. Support is on-line only, no telephone or email so I was unable to solve the Error messages.I wouldn't recommend this program."
1,continuing crashes,"I was almost relieved to read the other reviews of this program, it used to crash alot on my older computer but I thought all the problems would be fixed when I brought home my new laptop last weekend. I was trying to redesign my 1100 sq foot house and everytime I start the program it will only run for 10 minutes or 2-3 changes. And every other time I try to save any changes, the software crashes without saving,which is extemely frustrating. Oh well, at least I know it's not my computer, back to the store for a decent piece of software."
1,Frustrating!,"I spent 3 hours trying to design my kitchen. When I switched to 3D mode, cabinets and chairs would spontaneously float off the floor. At one point a cabinet decided to move into the sink, despite the fact I set in on the ground in 2D mode. It was complete frustration. Needless to say after a grand total of 5 impossible hours, I returned it for a refund."
3,good product faulty design,this lighter has an amazing torch. one of the best i've seen and over all good design with the exception of how the torch springs out. a lot of stress is on only two little mounting points made from plastic. over time these mounts break. other than that one design flaw the lighter is very elegant and have recieved many compliments.
1,A piece of crap,"It doesn't conform to FD spec. Very difficult to put on and almost can't get off my FD lens.After carefully examination, I found the problem. It is missing a small hole in the adptor. I need to drill a small hole to make it work. Which hole? Look at an original FD rear cap, you will know.Now I can put it on and take it off easily. But...it is not tight enough when use on any FD lens. Making it useless. It doesn't conform to FD spec. Period.A piece of crap from India."
3,Not bad...,"The product I received did not look like the picture.It does work, and I had no problem getting it on and off the camera or my old lenses-- but be GENTLE!As stated in other reviews, it will not infinity focus. This wasn't a big problem for me, as I was mostly enjoying being able to use my macro lens again, but it was a bit irritating. If you need infinity focus, of course don't buy this!If, like me, you are considering this just to play around with those old lenses, go for it! If you are expecting to get pro grade awesome photos out of it, you probably won't without a lot of work."
4,Makes it Possible to Use Your Old Lenses,This lens mount adapter allows you to use your old Canon FD lenses on you new Canon EOS camera. It works well with telephoto lenses in the manual mode. Just stop your lens down and let the camera select the shutter speed in the Program mode. Works great with telephotos but doesn't work at all with wide angle lenses. Don't put it on too tight or you might not get it off.
1,Terrible Adapter for a Canon 7D,"This is a terrible adapter to buy for the Canon 7D.Since it has no glass inside of it, it's IMPOSSIBLE to get anything close to infinity focus. Only things up close will gain focus so basically it's just good as a sloppy Macro lens for the canon 7D.Honestly, I was deceived by the picture as it looked like a solid adapter, but most definitely not.DO NOT BUY for the smaller sensors."
1,Adorama Poor Customer Service,"The product I ordered was not what I got. They sent me a cheaper product.I tried to contact customer service they only wanted to pass the buck and tell me maybe I bought it from somewhere else. <h1>Save your money, don't buy from Adorama!!!!</h1>"
1,Piece of junk,Purchased from Adorama. No lens. Just the fitting. No focus. No work. Can't get off the FD lens. Stuck. Not worth any price. This particular product is malicious. Will now have to take the FD lens to a camera shop to see if they can get it off without harming the lens. We've tried everything we can think of.
3,A Practical Manual,"Mr. Dobson's book gives practical advice on how to enter commodity or stock market positions using one of the simplest and perhaps most reliable tactics: buying or selling 50 percent retracements of major moves. If you believe that the simplest solutions are often the most effective, this book will delight you. It gives a step-by-step system for using the retracement rule to make profitable trades. If your are sometimes overwhelmed by myriad technical market indicators, implementing this simple approach can help cut through the fog of conflicting technical data."
3,Very basic,"The whole book talk about just one rule, But the rule is very very important to trading and works in all markets. Sad thing is i could of found out the rule just by doing a lil searching online."
2,Annoying noise for the most part,"I'm sure these are highly skilled musicians here, and what they do sounds difficult, but what they have produced here amounts to over an hour straight of annoying (though interesting) noise.Often people will discredit a song as ""nothing but noise"" if they strongly dislike it. When I call this ""noise,"" however, I do not mean that I strongly dislike it (although, of course, I do strongly dislike it), I mean that it truly does sound more like noise than music - random tooting of horns and banging of drums and plucking of strings. As noise, it really isn't that bad I suppose, but as music I found it difficult to enjoy.My recommendation is that you listen to the one minute sample provided by Amazon. If you don't like it you probably won't enjoy the other 75 minutes either."
4,"Installation problem, but works well","Would not install. I had to go to their web site and download an update. After the update, everything went smoothly.I have not tried all the features, but it was very easy to capture video and create a movie from it. Other than the initial intallation problem, I am pretty happy with this."
2,Latency and S-Video Connection issues,"I installed this device and software + latest drivers bringing it to version 10.7. The PC is a P4 with 2 gigs of ram and 120 gigs of hard drive space. Software from the DVD took about 1 hour to load for all full features (2 discs). My issue came with the actual video capture. The S-Video input did not operate as specified and kept returning a error that no signal was present. Because of this, I had to use the composite input. (Checked all software settings but nothing resolved with S-Video).Monitoring of signal had a definite lag time with at least 10 seconds so it became difficult to sync the exact moment of capture. (This can be resolved though with the editing of the capture after executed. All in all I feel that this device is overpriced for what it is. Also, although it said on the box that the videos can be coded for Mpeg 4, the software settings did not list this other than Mpeg 1-2. I am returning the unit and getting just a basic capture device"
1,Does Not Work- No Customer Service,"If I could give this product, and this company, less than one star I would. I spent two months going back and forth with customer service in E-Mails trying to get the problems resolved. I followed all of their instructions. Not only did the product not work, their slow and inept customer service told me to upgrade my PC video card to make it work. I did. That didn't help. Then, they would not give me a refund. Steer clear. Once you buy this dog, you're stuck!"
1,couldn't use it,"I attempted to use just the box after reading a lot of ""stuff"" about the software online.I was not able to use it that way so tried to load the software and it kept shutting down my computer. This is not what I expect from a hardware/software bundle in this day and age. Especially one that is so simplistic. DOn't buy it."
5,Excellent product,"Cutting board does not slip on the counter. Does not dull knifes and is the perfect size for dicing vegtables, meats etc. The groove around the outside prevents the counter tops from getting wet. Excellent item, If you need a cutting board, I would suggest one of these."
2,Not low self discharge batteries.,"I bought these with the DPS-601 charger to power my point and shoot digital camera about a year ago. They did recharge several times before I noticed their capacity begin to decline. I also noticed that if they sat for any length of time in the camera, I would get the message to change the batteries when I turned it on. Recently, they would only hold enough charge for 20-30 pictures without flash even if they were freshly charged. I had given these up for dead until I got a La Crosse smart charger. They refreshed to 2000mAh. I believe I will get some more use out of these by using a smart charger. I would not buy these again. If you want batteries that will be ready at any time even if they've been sitting in the camera for weeks, invest in Sanyo Eneloops or similar low self discharge batteries from a trusted name brand. Digipower Endure Series 1 batteries will not last using a dumb charger. If you have a smart charger you may get your money's worth out of these."
2,Not a white paper,This paper is a nice weight and has a nice feel to it but it is not white. It is more of an ivory color so it did not work for me.
4,Not so white.. ( probably because natural white),"Quality of the paper is good, but I am disappointed with the color of the paper. It is not so white.. If you are looking for pure white paper this is not the right product..."
1,float,It is a good float i have had 3 of them but all three got a hole in them.So beware they will get a hole i will not buy another because the last float last less then a month and got a hole in it
2,2 or under,"I bought this for my toddler. He was able to use it for less than 1 month. He grew out of it.The velcro strap on the bottom is much too short. It is also very hard to remove after the childis done swimming.I had to deflate the whole tube,to get him out,ending his day of swimming.It's a good idea, but is not for kids over 2.I think it could be made better."
1,Terrible AND DANGEROUS!,"I was so excited to so these tubes as an option for my 2.5 yo and 17 mo old. BUT first use and they both went under. Thankfully I was right there to grab them, but it still scared my son and now he won't use a ring because ""they make him go upside down in the water."" WARNING -- do NOT buy. These are dangerous!"
3,"Okay, but not live...","Maybe it was just me, but I thought this was a LIVE album. Instead, it's basically a studio recording of 3DN with an orchestra for arrangements. Not that it's all bad, but it seems to be basically the same 'ol 3DN songs with a large orchestra for intros and background. A lot of the familiar favorites ( with a couple of exceptions missing...ie. Eli's Coming) but still a good listen of the old favorites."
2,Where's Chuck?,"This could have been an incredible album (much like Grand Funk's ""Bosnia"" album) and a tribute to one of the best groups of the 70's. Sadly, it is missing one ingredient, Chuck Negron. Cory Wells is a great soloist (Mama Told Me Not To Come)and Danny Hutton has his moments (Liar) but hearing Danny attempting to sing ""One"", Joy To The World, and ""Easy To Be Hard"" is too much to ask for those familiar with the originals (all three songs and many of their other hits were originally sung by Chuck). The production is great, Richie Podolor, the original producer still has the touch and the harmonies are impeccable. But this album should be called ""Two Dog Night"", and not ""Three Dog Night"" since one-third of the original group is missing. Here's hoping they re-unite (soon) and give the fans what they deserve, a band that can rival the original group."
1,Maybe one day,"Maybe one day this band will be what it once was. Three Dog Night will never be the same without Chuck Negron.You can fluff it up all you want-- it just doesn't work.Should you listen to Chuck's new live cd, you will definitely see he does not need the London Symphony.Hey Danny and Cory, when are all of you going to put things behind you and reunite. You need to grab your spot in Rock & Roll and re-gain your place in history.There should be a secong coming. DON'T YOU THINK??"
2,Two Dog Night Needs The 3rd Dog?,"Three Dog Night With the London Symphony Ochestra is nothing more than an oldies group re-recording their old hits in which every tune is inferior to the original. Hutton and Wells make a valient effort in what is nothing more than an exercise in remake futility. Buy the ""Best Of Three Dog Night"" which is a 20 track compilation of all their biggest hits and features Chuck Negron the lead voice behind 3/4 of their hits. Hardcore fans must be lying to themselves if they think thid cd is worth 4 or 5 stars. When you hear ""one"", and ""Joy To The World"" without Chuck Negron you quickly realize how important he was to this group. WARNING: THESE ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS SO PROCEED WITH CAUTION?"
3,A very average book,"This is my second book in Terry Pratchett's Discworld. After reading Going Postal, I had some high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, this book doesn't flow well, nor does it maintain an interest level.Basically, a writer comes upon a printing press and almost haphazardly starts a newspaper. While an interesting concept, the characters and tangents that dominate this book becomes a little too much.While not a terrible read, it's not the smoothest read either. The depths into fantasy are not my taste, especially the needless descriptions of gollums, trolls, and vampires. Some parts bored me silly.All in all, it's decent, but I cannot recommend it."
3,worked ok,"I bought this pack when we were trying to concieve our last baby. It was a cheap multi pack which is what I needed. I used several that turned out to be negative, but when I finally was pregnant, it took quite a while for the pregnant line to show up and it was very faint at first. I took one and it looked negative, so I throw it away. Then I knew I had to be pregnant, so I took another one and it still looked negative. So I set that one aside and took another one. About 20 min later, I saw a really faint line and looked at the one I previously took and there was a definate line. So you just have to give them a long time to work (which is torture when you want to know) So they work fine, just slow."
1,dumb,The worst game i ever played its a stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid horrible horrible horrible horrible super stupid game
2,Eh.,"Not what I call a great game, it's a game but not well developed. I remember the older Tony Hawk games and could recall they were a lot better than this. I think the development team on this just got lazy and wanted to make a game with ""better"" graphics for the newer systems and just threw out some upchucked garbage for the older consoles. Really bad move on their part. I'd stay away and go back to the older titles."
2,Very Disorganized. Bad Quality. Bad contents. Some katas.,"This is a really disorganized book. Badly edited, looks like a highschool news paper. Tries to cover so many things, that it's REALLY superficial. In 100 pages (+/-)covers how 2 get in shape, basic warm up, how to eat, how to bow, how to use bokken (really badly explained -not usefull for beginners), how to use Jo Staff, and 5 or 6 Kumitashi (2 person) Katas. Some pictures, some BAD drawings, it's not useful for a beginner -too superficial, cryptic pictures and explanations-, and if you already know the katas and movements in the book, you can hardly call it a good reference book."
1,Superficial & often wrong,"Bad writing, worse illustrations and its obvious that Kirby doesn't have much of an understanding of kenjutsu. Save your money or buy one of Obatu's books."
5,Celestial Seaonings Tea,I love this tea and my grocery store no longer carries it. I was glad to find it here and be able to get auto shipments and a resonable price.
2,Video quality,Video has jerky sections between clear sections.Overall the story line is OK.Perhaps I should only purchase new DVDs
2,jusk okay,I ordered several Teletubbies DVDs. This was not my favorite. It was just okay. My 14 mo. old did not seem impressed either.
5,Tubby Heaven,My children adore the teletubbies and watching them play in the snow is great fun (especially since we live in the South and don't see much snow). We are fans of all the teletubbies videos!
2,Like reading a dictionary,"We love books. Bat books, bunny books, fat books, funny books. However, we did not love this book. It is simply page after page of tiny dinosaurs with the name of each one under it (my guess is 100 of them). The print is too small to read or see unless you put the book to your face. I made it past page 2. My toddlers simply got up & walked away (they have NEVER done that before at story time, but you see there isn't a story here) This book is perfect for a teen doing a research paper (a prehistoric teen who doesn't have internet access or a library), but not a tot who wants to know more about dino's then just their names. We enjoyed the series of How Do dinosaurs....by Yolen"
2,He's no Dan Jenkins,"Gary decided to write a golf book that has neither the wit nor the accuracy of his usual on-camera comments. Loosely strung together stories, non-stories and poems (apparently concocted with the help of the Oxford Standard Dictionary at his side)leave this reader wondering what the author was striving for. Be prepared for repetitive references to Fairway Louie and be sure to overlook the typos the editors failed to catch. Or, in the best case, avoid the book altogether"
5,The Book of Kehls,"A book you can't put down - that's the way I would describe Mrs. O'Hagan's The Book of Kehls. You get the feeling that you grew up with her in the way she draws the reader into the most intimate part of her life in dealing with her parents, her siblings and her disabled son, Jamie. This book is about an Irish family and how they deal with a disease that affected everyone in their family. It is about a mother who is above all human, unashamedly sharing her emotions that run the gamut from being frustrated to being hilarious. Above all, this book shows Mrs. O'Hagan's strength and unending love in letting her son know that it is okay to stop fighting and to find peace. A must read."
4,Jazz Accordion Masterpiece,"As the only readily available Leon Sash product in print, this reissue of an LP is a must-have for anyone interested in Jazz Accordion, and an ear-opener for any accordion fan not familiar with Sash. Less well-known than Art Van Damme, Sash nevertheless ranks at the top of the accordion virtuosi. With sympathetic backing from only a rhythm section, Sash's sophisticated readings of standards and his own compositions range from gorgeously lyrical gems (Polka Dots and Moonbeams) to keyboard-busters (Pennies from Heaven). Sash's custom dual right-hand keyboard accordion can confound the technically-minded listener and player wondering how he got his chord voicings. Strongly recommended."
5,great,"I love this cd. I wish there were more recordings on cd of this sound. Totally different sound and style from Art Van Damme, but just as exciting and talented. Great cd!!"
1,Cheap Junk,"This product did not fit correctly. It ripped without too much force. I contacted the seller. After 3 months of the run-around and 8 e-mails to the seller Amazon.com paid me off for the product ""NOT COVERCRAFT"". They are as disreputable, sleezy, cheap and evasive a co. as I have ever dealt with. I'm gratefull I bought through Amazon as otherwise there would have been no recourse. To this day Covercraft has never contacted me again and I still don't have a tire cover... Steve A"
2,kinda a horrible book,"The first story was interesting and I liked it some. Kinda quirky. The second about the lady in the van was pretty disgusting. The harsh realities of someone living a homeless lifestyle with no hygiene and little ideas of civil behavior. It was NOT funny, just sad and upsetting. I guess it was best to let her live her life as she choose to, but she was not mentally sound, and was really needing more help than she received. I cannot imagine how the author could have passively just let it go with her living in his front yard knowing how neglected she was and how extreme her circumstances were. It was nothing like it was described in other reviews, or on the book itself. I'm only glad I read it first before attempting to give it as a gift to my friend. I gave it to a 2nd hand bookstore instead."
4,One great story /one not so great,The first story (The Clothes They Stood Up In) is wonderful. The second story just does not grab you.
3,two divergent lfestyles........one question.......,"This is a book the encompasses two short stories that at first glance may seem totally unrelated but, in fact, are very similar.In the first story a couple is robbed of all their earthly possessions except for what they are wearing. What happens when all your ""things"" are missing? How is your life defined by the things that surround you? How are your possibilities limited? These are some of the questions that are explored.In the second tale, an elderly woman lives her life completely out of her van, everything she owns is packed into the van. Is she more free than those who have more material possessions or is her life limited by this lack of personal property??With these two unique looks into the lives of two very divergent lifestyles the author opens up the world of possibility and contentment that people seek to achieve."
4,Witty and Charming,"The Clothes They Stood Up in and The Lady in the Van are two very charming, very witty works--one is a novella, the other an extended essay about a most unusual woman Alan Bennett was acquainted with for many years. The novella concerns a couple whose possessions are all taken from them--all but the clothes on their back. The essay concerns an eccentric woman who lived in a van on Bennett's property. Both pieces are very funny and both ruminate on the nature of possessions and acquisitiveness effectively. These are enjoyable, breezy works."
2,Skip the short story,"I read this book AFTER I read Uncommon Reader and was disappointed with the short story/novella. But Bennett's essay Lady in the Van gave me pause and was well-worth the read. Bennett, a well-known playwright allows a homeless woman to park her van in his driveway for years. The essay (compiled from newspaper columns he wrote) is honest ... not saccharine at all."
1,Odd smell,"I've bought and used the Medela quick clean wipes before, but in the resealable package. These individually wrapped wipes have a very strange chemical smell to them, to the point that I will only use them to wipe the table or work surface I'm standing bottles and pump parts on. I won't use them on the pump itself, after it has dried completely. Very, very strange and disappointing."
5,Great product no problems,The systemworks installed easily and has worked flawlessly for the last several months. Buy it you won't be sorry.It has kept my computer virus free and running fine.
1,Great ide with a huge flaw,"Could all reviewers of any Oregon scientific globe please indicate whether they have managed to update their globes? A huge manufacturing flaw is that the globe cannot be updated and if you dare to try, you destroy the pen and have a globe but nothing else. This is misleading advertising saying the globe can be updated. There is no costumer service to help you if you do update it. Still if you do not update it, it's a great product. As a result, this is a frustrating product because it's close to be a great one but isn't."
4,"Well presented, well made",Stories are classics.Illustrations are nice.Binding is good.Cover seems very hard wearing.Quite heavy and sturdy.
3,Bedtime stories,the book was a little more beat up then I would have expected. I had to glue it back to the binding.
4,Great for reading aloud!,"The language in these stories is great for reading out loud, but I want to issue a word of warning. Some of the pictures are too scary for my 3 year old. I was very disappointed that the troll in the Three Billy Goats Gruff story was such a hideous thing. My daughter was actually scared of the pictures. There are other instances of that throughout the book, so if you have a really young reader, please take that into consideration."
2,"Great stories, poor quality","I was really excited about this book, because it was the book that I had when I was little, updated of course. I really wanted to share this with my boys, but my favorite story wasn't even in it anymore, The Gingerbread Man. It's got all the other stories, and the pictures are even the same as when I had the older version, which I loved. It's got Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Hansel and Gretel, Henny Penny, Puss in Boots, Jack and the Beanstalk, The Little Red Hen, Snow White, The Three Little Pigs, The Tortoise and the Hare, The Steadfast Tin Soldier, Cinderella, The Ugly Duckling, The Pied Piper of Hamelin, Sleeping Beauty, Rumpelstiltskin and The Three Billy Goats Gruff. The 'imitation leather' version, I repeat, DOES NOT have The Gingerbread Man. When I got this in the mail, and I opened up the box, it was already falling apart. The binding is horrible. Don't get me wrong, the stories are wonderful, but it should be better quality."
5,Informative,"If you are a music and literary lover, this is your book. Sure, we know Elvis copied more Black music than Pat Boone, the Beastie Boys, Vanilla Ice, and The Osmonds combined, but this book takes you to Harlem, the center of Black Culture, so that you can understand the severity of the cultural theft. This book will make you a sophisticated musical genius. Buy it now!Elvis Presley Is Alive and Well and Living in Harlem"
4,syrup pourer,"excellent product: sturdy, effective gasket/seal, durable glass container.Easy to clean.Size good for family of 2 to 4 -- appx. 6 oz."
5,Just like Mom's,My mother always served syrup and honey in dispensers like these. It's like old times but with the convenience I expect now.
3,seems to be good,The seat seems to be good but it does not fit my bike. I am not able to turn the wheels without it hitting the feet at the lowest. When the feet are at the highest- it works great. I guess I will have to buy a different bike :-) I also kinda wish the seat hooked on to the bar a little safer than just that one screw.
3,Too small,"I bought this product from Walmart and I will be returning it tomorrow. Maybe it can carry up to 40 pounds if you can fit that child in there. It is very small. As soon as my daughter saw it, she thought this was something for her baby doll. She is 2.5 years old. I really can not imagine a 30-pound-child in this thing."
4,GREAT IDEA,love it! just needed to buy longer screws to fit it around the bike. My 16mos old daughter loves it!
4,Fun to use,This bike seat is actually a lot of fun to use. It allows for easy interaction with the child and makes the ride more interesting for her and the parent.Easy to install and doesn't hinder my pedaling.It does seem a little small though and I am not sure my daughter (now 2.5 years) will be able to continue using it next summer.Protection wise: hard to tell. It doesn't wrap around the kids like rear seats do but then again the kid would probably be protected by my body if we fall on the side.
4,Got a lot of use!,"We bought this when our son was 10 months old. It was great for him then, and now, at over 4 years old, it's still great! He's 106cm and 16kg and if I were any shorter (I'm 5'10""), we'd have to come up with another plan, but we should be fine until school ends!I use this to bike me and my son to our school each morning. It's about a 20 minute ride each way, so I was worried about the position my knees would be in while I biked. It's possible that I turn them out slightly, but not enough to notice or bother me. I've never done anything long or hilly, but flat riding is easy and my son loves sitting where we can talk about what we see.My only gripe is that somewhere around year 3, the red straps virtually disintegrated and had to be tossed. My son is good about sitting still, but he's not strapped in any longer."
1,Did not fit my bike,This is not product review but compatibility issue which can be very common.I have a hybrid bike which has a thin handle and this seat didn't fit on that. So I ended up returning.
3,works great but small,"It fits my bike nicely and pretty sturdy after installation. The last screw that's connecting the seat and the bar didn't fit nicely but we could work it out. It looks great, works great and baby loves it but size is pretty small.I have 15 months old baby (about 25 lbs) and it fits just about right which seemed she could only use it less than 6 months. Best bike baby carrier I've seen so far but not designed for a long time use."
5,It's worked for us!!,"I wasn't into the typical bike seat...I got enough wrinkled noses at the idea of biking with my toddler on board, so I wanted to try an alternative. This seemed interesting, and more comfortable to keep my daughter where I could see her and talk to her while keeping my eyes on the road. It was no sweat to install and we have used it frequently since early spring, when my daughter was 3.5, 30 lbs and 33"" tall. I find it an easy balance, even when we fill our front basket with library books, etc. She loves the riding experience. We even FELL with this seat once, on a recent rainy morning - my kid came out unscathed, as, being near my arms, I was able to catch her above the pavement when we slipped on the it while mounting up!! Now that she's just over 4 she's getting tall enough that we will be looking at trailers soon, but it is still a comfortable ride. I paid almost double the current price and consider it well worth it!"
4,"Great product, but not intended for short people!","I loved the idea of this bike seat but it didn't work for me! I'm 4' 10"" and once I put this seat on my bike I couldn't reach the ground without jumping off the bike (not possible with the seat right in front of you). I bought a new bike so that I could reach the ground from the seat but unfortunately the span between the handle bars and the seat was too short to fit the child seat. Maybe a taller person would have better luck."
4,Infant Fun,I bought this Child Bike Seat after I saw a neighbor using one. The seat is well made with hard steel and durable plastic.I have total confidence that my daughter is safe and secure with this product.The downside is that the screws supplied with the seat are too short for mounting onto a mountain bike and you'll have to run to Home Depot for a longer set.Why not just give us the longer screws to begin with? It's a good product but just be ready to improvise a bit.
4,Kangaroo Wee Ride child Bike Seat!!!,"I wanted a child seat to ride my 19 month old son with. I saw this and thought it would be good because the child sits in the front. My sister had a bike seat mounted in the back. I took my son on a ride with that one and he didn't like it nor did I. I like this one because it mounts in the front of the bike. The balance and turning of this bike seat vs. the back mounted seat was everything the website said. It's easier to turn and balance with the weeride. I received it about 3 weeks ago. I bought a beach cruiser with 7 speeds. The mounting of the seat took about a week because I could only work on it during the weekends. I had to drill a hole in the tube frame of the bike in order to secure the seat to the bar that was included. After that it mounted very tight and secure. My son loves the seat and I do too. I would recommend it to anyone. It just takes a little mechanical experience to mount it correctly. Also, you can't beat the price."
4,wee ride,"my child loves this bike carrier! wasnt too happy about wearing a helmet. it was easy to install, the bike it is attached should have longer tubing under the seat so as not to attach to the actual adjustable tubing of the seat. otherwise you have to remove or loosen, each time the seat needs adjustment.very simple to get child in & out. the straps however are as short as possible right now, and are not as snug as i would prefer. if your child is small the belt straps are adjustable, but cannot go to be small enough for a child of ~20 lbs or so."
5,desperate mom,"After searching for a bicycle seat for my 20 month old daughter, this seat has it all! I didn't feel comfortable with the seats that sit on the back of your bicycle, the weight distribution was awful! After getting the wee-ride, it took my husband about a half hour to put on, my daughter LOVES it!!! The first time out, she fell asleep on the head rest and my arms kept her straight, the foot holders are great. When people in my neighborhood saw us riding around they did a double take! I cannot rave enough about this fabulous seat! My daughter is safe, comfortable and loves going for a family bike ride now!"
4,Fun bike seat...,"We bought this carrier for our 1 year old daughter and attached it to my husbands bike - and we LOVE it! She enjoys being up front with the wind going through her hair and seeing everything as we ride along. Much better than seeing dad's back the whole time. The only issue I have with the seat is that my daughter will quickly outgrow the straps - she's a big 1 year old, but we're looking to buy larger straps so she can use the seat for longer."
1,really silly!!,"This bicyle seat is rediculous!! I bought this seat for my 2 year old who is very small for her age. Upon opening the box, I immediately realized there was no way any child bigger then say.... 25 lbs would fit in this thing. THEN, I went on to try and mount it onto my bycicle, and there was just no way no how. I have four very different bikes at my house, beach cruiser, womens mtn., mens mtn., and a tandum cruiser (nice bikes too, no junk) and this seat would not mount to any of them. I am going to return it to the store I bought it from and look for a better product :0)."
1,bike seat,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! this was the biggest was of money it was such a pain to put on having to take you bike apart to do it it says for up to 30 or 40 pounds you'll be lucky if one of you childs stuff dolls will fit i would not recomend this to anyone
2,Love the idea but it's not practical,We love to bike as a family and we first started with a trailer which neither one of my kids liked. So we finally bought a back child seat for my 3 year old and I just wore my 17 month old on my back in my ergo carrier. Now that's it's summer time in FL it's too hot for that so I came across this seat and fell in love with the idea. So I tried it for the first time today and I hate it. I don't like to say that but I really just do not like it. I went 2 blocks and my inner thighs were super red from the seat scratching the inside of my legs. I have to bow my legs out just to pedal. I guess if you are just cruising the town it would be ok if you are wearing pants so it doesn't rub but we bike on trails and uphill and I couldn't imagine doing that with this seat. I Love though how my child was so close to me but I don't understand how this seat can be used comfortably. I'm really disappointed and I'm now looking into an ibert seat instead
3,"Great, but still difficult to ride with","I loved the idea of a front carrier seat so I can keep an eye on my munchkin and she can see where we're going. We ended up putting this on my husband's mountain bike because I couldn't reach the handles around the seat itself. My husband said the most difficult part of having the seat in front of him was he couldn't stand up when he needed to to go up larger hills and my daughter's bike helmet kept hitting him in the chest. Also, when she leaned over either side to look at something he almost fell over a time or too. The seat itself is great (except for the difficulty of getting a child in and out of the harness), it just didn't work for our family.We ended up getting a bike trailer for our 2 and half year old 25 pound munchkin. She's much happier because she can see and have toys and snacks with her while we ride."
3,not for short people,"I'm 5'4''. I find it's hard (impossible)to get on and off my bike with this baby seat on. The bar for install the seat blocks my way. My feet can't reach ground if I can't get off from the front.It doesn't work out for me. Tried couple times it's not working. what a pity. We have been waiting to go for a ride.The quality is good and not hard to install. But, not for me."
4,We love our WeeRide Kangaroo!,"We love our new WeeRide Kangaroo child bike seat. It was very easy to install and I love that when I want to go on a bike ride by myself it is one screw and I am good to go. I would say it is different riding with her, my legs are further out to get around the seat but it is not uncomfortable. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to get out there on their bike with their little one."
1,Leaves no room for the driver...,"We really wanted a child bike seat that would allow our son to see more than just one of his parent's backsides during our family bike rides. So, we researched and purchased what we thought was the best for the amount of money we could spend--the WeeRide Kangaroo. It was not too difficult to install, however, only upon installation does one realize there is no room for the ""driver"" to stand while straddling the bike. The WeeRide takes up all of the frame, from the seat to the handlebars, leaving no room to hold the bike up when coming to a stop. We ended up having to return the seat to Amazon."
1,Not much freedom to ride...,"The WeeRide is a great idea, but it's really not comfortable to use. You have to bow your legs out to pedal otherwise your knees hit the seat, even when it's as far forward as it will go! And the part where they can put their hands or put their head down can get in the way when you're trying to make a turn. If I'd have known about the iBert I would have gotten that one because it keeps the child's legs forward and just looks more comfortable for both of you! The safety straps on the WeeRide are a joke. Buy the iBert!"
3,"ok, but some issues","my 1.5 year old daughter loves riding this. the front-mount design is great. it feels very secure and stable to have her in front of me.now the issues: first, this was difficult to install on my specialized mountain bike. the only place for me to mount the front clamp is on the handlebar stem. unfortunately, the clamp is much larger than the stem, leaving a loose fit. i think i'll be able to get something from the hardware store to make it fit better. also, the back clamp was too big for my seat stem. however, i was able to solve this by switching the bolts front the front and rear clamps (the front bolts are larger). lastly, the plastic seat portion is a bit flimsy."
1,My Granddaughter FELL OFF as the ONE THUMBSCREW gave out,"I liked the idea and bought this and enjoyed it for two days. My wife went out and put our granddaughter in the Wee Rider and as she was standing there the seat fell. It became unattached from the bar and my granddaughter took a tough fall, if she did not have her bike helmet on she could have been hurt.We looked back at the directions as I thought I may have missed something but I did not, there is only one thumbscrew that holds the whole thing to the frame. To make it easy to remove there is no bolt underneath. I can't believe others haven't had this issue. I plan on returning it and writing the company. Four screws with bolts to hold the bar to the frame but only one thumbscrew to hold the Wee Rider to the bar is crazy."
2,Very uncomfortable,"First, this product did not fit on my husband's bike at all, so I had to put it on mine, which was not as planned. Second, when we finally got in on there, I had to pedal bow-legged to get my knees around the seat...and not a little. It was really unwieldy. On top of that, with the extra weight of my daughter, I felt really unsteady going around turns. Then, my one yr old started grabbing things...my bike, my arms, my face whatever she could get her hands on. I felt like a circus monkey trying to balance on a unicycle. Needless to say, I am going to start looking for the bike trailers, even though they are a lot more expensive, because this thing just does not work. BTW, I am a 5'6"" female - maybe if you are a 6 ft. tall man it would work?? Really, I am one of those people that never gives up on an idea - I have duct-taped a lot of things together in the name of making it work, but there was just no way this was ever going to be comfortable."
2,"Neat Idea, Just Doesn't Fit",I gave it 2 stars because it's a great idea. I couldn't give it any more than that because it wouldn't fit my bike (Gary Fisher) or my husbands (Specialized). The seat went on my bike after I removed my seat but the platform would not fit because I couldn't remove the handlebars! I had to attach it to the spacers on my bike instead of the tube and my husband's bike didn't have a tube or spacers to attach it to. I don't know how this seat fits any bike. I really wanted it to work and was so disappointed when it didn't. I got this seat for $56 at Wal-Mart and I'm glad I did so I don't have to pay the shipping fee to return it. I ordered the iBert seat from Amazon since I couldn't find it locally. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it fits!
2,Disappointed!,"I was so excited to receive this child bike seat, but was very disappointed! The seat could not attach to either of what I thought were standard bikes. Where the bar is supposed to attach on the front of the bike, the bar swivels. Therefore, it didn't work. I tried but couldn't turn the bike very easily. Not only that, but check out how small the seat is compared to a normal child's bike seat. The seat is teeny, and doesn't seem safe and protective if you where to fall. Bummer!"
5,My son loves it!,"My son loves this! I was a little bit nervous putting him on it what he would think but he loves it and goes everywhere with us in his wee ride. Such a great purchase and good price too! I feel very secure with him right there in the front with me. My brother is a pro cyclist and works at a bike shop and has very strong opinions about bike things and he approved the Wee Ride. It installed quickly and easily but I haven't tried just taking the seat off yet, haven't needed to."
2,What the manufacturer doesn't tell you....,"As at least one reviewer has noted, it doesn't fit many bikes. Before buying, look at the ""neck"" of your bike's frame above the crossbar and just below where it meets the rotating shaft connected to the handle bars. If this stationary ""neck"" of your frame is not at least 1"" long, forget this product. Most mountain bikes have virtually no neck at all, so check before you buy!"
3,Didn't fit my son or me very well,"My son's feet didn't fit in the footrests width-wise with shoes on, so he had to ride barefoot or with those water sock type shoes on. He outgrew it in general by age 2, but his feet were too big by 1 1/2, and he has normal sized feet. I really like that he sits in front of me, but make sure that your bike has a long frame. Mine is a cruiser and I had to ride with my knees slightly pointed out because his seat was so close to me. Overall, it's a nice idea, but the bike rides were too uncomfortable to really enjoy."
2,Don't waste your money,I bought this for my one year old it seems cool but my knee knock it and I don't feel like I really have enough room. It is sturdy and does attach to the bike easily but I only test rode it because my kid wouldn't even sit in it. I would get a back seat in hindsight( ha) anyhoo maybe it would work better on a mans bike. If you have the money the Madsen cargo bike rocks so much I love that thing.
5,Comfortable and safe,"We use this seat several times and my baby always have a lot of fun, very safe and excellent materials"
2,"Very interested, but is it logistical","I was very interested in purchasing one of these for my then infant so that I could see him while riding bikes with the rest of the family, but I tried one before buying and, being short in stature (I'm 5'2""), my legs kept hitting the foot rests of the seat and we kept having to play head tango. It's a swell idea, but not for those of the shorter variety."
4,wee ride,"love the seat, hate that amazon made it appear that the bar didn't come with it, now i have an extra bar that it completely unnecessary. next time, i may look on amazon and buy somewhere else."
4,"nice and sturdy, but could be approved",The carrier was easy to put assemble and my 18mo old daughter loves riding in the front. My only complaint is that there's no quick way to detach the seat for riding solo. Otherwise I love it and I feel safe placing my daughter in the seat.
3,Very good!,"My son loves riding in this thing he can see all around every thing I see. Seems to fit well the strap system could be easier to use but works. Riding is not the same which I read in previous reviews however, to me right now not a big deal because my son starts to get fussy if I try stay on too long. I'm 6'2"" 225 lbs on a 19.5""mountain bike frame and my main problem is I can't really stand up and peddle or have seat higher than I can touch ground. However everything having a child is an adjustment why wouldn't my cycling experience. Overall, not bad for price it's half of what a trailer cost and I think more enjoyable for my son and me. Just happy to be out cruising a little and easy to handle."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"I ordered this seat for my bicycle so my daughter could ride and it's one of the best investments!! Unlike the rear mounting seats, it allows her to interact with me during our trips. She is safe and secure right between my arms...that's PRICELESS."
2,it's dangerous,"This bike sit create a danger because it doesn't let the rider to jump off or jump in on bike quickly. Baby is on the way (you constantly hit baby's head with your chest), bar it too high and child sit is to near to the main sit, so if you jump down than your groin get stuck in between two sits. It's create dangerous delays while on intersections and increase your chance to be hit by the car.My knees should go to the sides or the rub child sit. Also it come with some kind of a ""shield"" that go between baby and a bike wheel. I guess for baby sleep on it or defend from rollover. It's impossible to install it if your bike front bar is too high. I'm 6'2 and have normal size bike for my height by the way. Here is video of us riding it: [...]So I'm planning to buy child sit for the back of the bicycle."
1,not for all sized mamas,"Not for all sized mamas, especially if you are breastfeeding. We got this as a gift because my friend loved hers. But after installing it, putting my son in a helmet and taking off down the road I realized a major problem... My boobs kept hitting him in the head. It was uncomfortable for both of us. I took the seat off the bike and never used it again. We bought a back riding seat, problem solved."
5,A riding wee will go!!,"Yay! My wee ride seat arrived today! I am very impressed by the quality of this item! My husband attached to my bike pretty quickly.. and since it's winter here in Michigan we practiced a bit in the living room! So, I haven't officially taken my girl for a ride yet, but I don't see any issues with getting on the bike or peddaling. A lot of people said that you had to peddle with your legs bowed, but I don't have that issue. I'm 5'4 and also find no problems getting on the bike with the seat in place. My 14 month old loved our practice run in the living room! can't wait to take it for a full ride!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Does not fit ""virtually any"" bike, as claimed.","I was very disappointed to find that this seat does not fit on either my wife's or my bicycle. Both are fairly standard off-the-bike-store-rack models. The company's misleading advertising states it fits virtually any bike. What it should say is that you must have at least 3/4""-1"" of head tube extending above the top tube so that the front mounting clamp will fit without interfering with the headset bearings (steering mechanism.) My trek mountain bike has essentially no such space. My wife's Giant city/trail bike had a little more space due to the sloping ""ladies"" top tube, but the clamp still did not fit. Had I known this, I would not have wasted the shipping fees, and gotten a seat that fits."
3,"Not for shorter people (5'5"" or less)","Bought this for my 1 y.o. daughter, loving all that I read about it. We have the Bell Cocoon seat for our son, which seats him behind us. Naturally, having your child in front of you is much more appealing -- if you can.Unfortunately, after we installed it on my bike, we realized that I would not be able to make turns with it attached. I am 5'3"", and it looked doubtful that it would fit even before we attached it to my bike.So, just a quick warning for the shorter folks out there!"
2,bummed..,"I wanted so badly to LOVE this product. It's okay for short runs, it gets the job done. However, it was pretty uncomfortable for me. I'm 5'4"" and my daughter's helmet hit me square in the chest, she had to lean forward. (she's only 15mo old and also petite!). Plus, I had to bike with my legs splayed/knees pointing out. Just plain akward..I have to second the other reviewer who commented negatively on the seat belt system. It's not a very easy in/out set up and the straps slipped off my petite daughter's shoulders. The ride must've been comfortable for her though, she'd even fall asleep w/ her head on the pad!!We did get lots of comments on how unique/great idea the seat was. I truly wanted this product to work out, it just didn't cut it and we broke down and bought a pull behind bike trailer."
4,fun for toddler,My son loves to ride with me in this. It was easy to install on my bike and seems safer than the ones that install on the back of the bike. Only issue - makes turning a little hard - gets in the way a bit - but I would recommend it to anyone looking to ride with their child.
4,I like the front loading bike seat,I was not smart enough to switch the bolts from the front to the back so I replaced the rear bolts. I can't imagine this would fit any non-steel seat post.I put the seat on a long wheelbase touring bike so I'm able to use cleats just fine. The splay of the legs is disappointing but more than made up for the fact that I get to hug Anna while I'm riding.I just have to teach my kid to keep her arms out of the way.It's definitely going to cut about 2 mph off your usual speed.But the cuteness factor is overwhelming.
4,Pretty Good Seat,"It was about a 3 out of 5 to install.It is such a simple concept. It is a simple, no frills seat. The strap system is kind of wierd.Overall, it is a good seat. My girl loves going for rides, and it is easy for me to ride with her in front. Much better than the seat in the back.P.S. kids dont need cup holders everywhere they go."
5,Awesome!,"We have owned this bike seat since 2009 and we love it! It is now being used for child #2. Contrary to other reviews, I am also 5"" tall and about 115 pounds I have never had an issue with this seat. It also fits nicely on my husbands bike. Both of our girls love biking and have ridden in this seat countless times. Yes you have to make some adjustments in the way that you ride as you have a child in front of you, but it is worth it to see your baby when you ride vs having them riding behind you."
2,Does not fit short rider's bike,"I have a Raleigh mountain bike and I am 5'2"" tall. The Wee Ride seat did not fit on the right spot on my seat post. It also had a lot of little screws, bolts and washers that were annoying to work with and the allen wrench could not fit in the tight spaces between the bicycle and the seat hardware. It is a cute seat but simply did not fit my bike."
5,WeeRide Kangaroo,"Well, It is well built and alot safer in my eyes. Your kid is actually locked inbetween your arms and in the middle which helps with balance no worries about getting off the bike and tipping backwards."
4,Fun Product,Product is not as easy to install as some say. Definitely need two pairs of hands or a clamp to hold the bar in place while attaching it to the frame. We had to switch the front bolts with the rear (specialized mtn bike) as my seat post is thicker than most. I am 5-11 and my knees do not hit the seat (some people probably have their seat too low). The straps are hard to adjust especially with a fidgeting two year old. All in all we are happy with this product and we would recommend it to anyone.
3,Great Idea - poor execution,"When I bought this, my daughter was very excited about it. However, when I tried to attach the cross bar to my seat and handlebars, the clasps weren't wide enough to go around the Seat bar. I returned it and bought the iBert version instead - it works really well!"
5,Beautiful moments,Amazing device. Love it. Very easy to mount on my bike. And very secure. No Problem with my legs and the weeride.
3,Too small for my Toddler,"This is a great seat for babies between 1-2, no older. Any larger than 25lbs. and your baby is too big. I've seen it work well for others, but didn't suit my needs personally. Otherwise, a great seat!"
1,"Not for anyone 5'-02"" or shorter","I thought this would be a great option since my twins were getting upset having to share the bike carrier. This was a disaster! I couldn't stabilize my bike when we stopped and almost fell over with one of my girls in the front carrier. I never read anything stating you should be a certain height, but the bar was a concern. Luckily we were only just out of the parking lot, so I walked the bike back home. I brought this right back to the store for a refund!The harness system bothered me too. It doesn't work like a car seat does. I had to stand them on their feet and wiggle them into the harness.I'm going to try one that hooks directly to the front of the bike. Great product if you're taller than me! :-)"
4,Will not fit Schwinn Majestic!,"I have to give the seat 4 stars as I have yet to use it. My wife has a Schwinn Majestic but the Kangaroo will not fit - the frame on this bike curves up, which moves the support bar above the head tube (so it would attach to the handlebar stem, which the manual explicitly states NOT to do). No fault to WeeRide, I needed to get my own bike anyways so I'll make sure to get one that will work with the Kangaroo."
5,Awesome!,"All I can really say about this. Have it on my Trek 7200 and it works fine. Not really noticed a change in riding style. Really love that my son is up front, makes the rides so much more enjoyable. He is constantly pointing things out and that makes it extremely fun. Plus as he got older he could reach forward and ring the bell. Only complaint I have is that he has outgrown it (had it for 2 summers) and now I must find something else. Maybe the Chariot Side Carrier, I can't see putting him behind me now as he has been up front this whole time.I also bought a second bar, thought would put it on my wife's bike, didn't happen, my fault for not measuring, women's bikes are hard to fit these things too."
2,Concept good but only for very young children,"This bike seat is sturdy and seems to be safe, but my 20 month old daughter, who is 39.5 inches tall (quite tall for her age), was already too tall for this seat, so I returned it. So this seat is for 6-18 month old children at best (or older if they are small), so if you get one, don't expect it to last for very long."
5,Great fun for my daughter and I,The seat is fantastic and my daughter loves to ride in it. I would recommend this seat to anyone!!
4,Glad we bought it,"This was fairly easy to install on my husband's mountain bike. Caveats are that the harness attaches in such a fashion that I was a little concerned about my 18 month old daughter's shoulders being able to slip out. There is no chest strap that narrows the harness over the chest since the buckle is down in the waist. However, that's a small detail. She seems pretty secure. The other issue is one that has already been brought up and is probably an issue with all of these styles of bike seats. When you peddle, you have to change how your legs move by splaying your knees out a little. This precludes it from being used for legitimate travel since it would be uncomfortable for longer or more demanding rides. A short ride around the block for the child's entertainment is just fine. That's why we bought it. My daughter absolutely loves it. She was VERY upset tonight when the ride was over and I took her out."
4,"Great seat, easy to assemble.","This was our second try after the iBert front seat, which didn't fit on my bike. The Weeride at first looks cheap and fragile, but it actually works perfectly! It is easy to assemble, the weight of the baby is in the middle of the bike so the bike movements and stability are not affected, and my 17 month old has a blast looking around while we ride! My only concern is the width of the seat: it is supposed to hold a 40 lb child, but my 24 lb son (a medium sized baby) is already almost filling it up completely."
4,"Very fun , but straps are not the best.","This is a very fun seat for babies, my son enjoys his rides , and he even demands to go out biking now.The only thing i wish it had, are better straps, they slip down and loosen up, i tried to tied them from the back, but they start to loosen again.This definitively needs a better strapping system.They should also have more colors!"
5,Great luck with this,We get so many compliments about this seat and our girls fit in there quite securely. Very pleased.
5,Great Product,We purchased this product to go on bike rides with our 15 month old. She is motion-adverse (doesn't even like the baby swing) but absolutely loves this bike seat. When we mention a bike ride - she is all smiles. My wife and I feel more comfortable as well with her in view and keeping the center of gravity where it belongs. Highly recommend!
4,WeeRide Seat,"He absolutely loved it. It fits well on any bike. The only problem I had is when it was on my bike, I am only 5'4"" and had troubles getting on with him in front of me. So he rode with his dad."
1,Doesn't fit my bike,"This product does not fit my older trek mountain bike. The installation system is not as flexible as the advertising makes it sound. Take a look at how much room you have on your head tube between the steer and frame before you order this product. You probably need at least 2""."
2,Disappointed,"I thought this would be a perfect alternative to the caboose type carrier, but I was very disappointed. The straps are way too long for my child (and probably for most kids--my daughter is 22 lbs and 30 in. tall). The seat is almost exactly straight up so she was leaning forward making it uncomfortable. I returned it."
4,Great buy!,"We love this bike. We bought it for our trip to Cape Cod and now use it and ride our bikes around the neighborhood all the time. I would've given this bike 5 stars, the only draw back is that my son (23 months) can reach my handle bars...but it's also a plus in that we share the handle bars and drive together (we have a rule that he can't move the handles, only momma steers). Other than that, this is great having the seat in front providing the ability to easily communicate with my son without taking my eyes off the road and I don't feel any of his movements - it's much more stable than a rear seat. I'd recommend this bike to anyone."
2,Great but...,"I love this seat and so does my son. However, and it's a pretty important however, the harness straps really need to be longer. My son is 21months but he's pretty big for his age and the straps are already at their limit which also means they slip out of the buckle if not secured a by pin or tied. I'm going to have to replace them/extend them myself pretty soon."
3,does not fit every bike,"This item is great, but contrary to the company's description it will not fit all bikes. I have an Electra cruiser but the top tube is too long to accomidate the unit. Tried it on my mountain bike; forward lean makes you squash your kids head. Fit great on my wife's cruiser but bike is too small for me and she does not feel comfortable riding with child. Weeride says they do not have adaptor to extend it or else I would have kept it and loved it."
4,talk of new york tony yayo straight from C-73 !!!!!,"This is tony yayo's latest mixtape produced by Big Mike , this mixtape come's out just before tony's first solo album "" thoughts of a predicate felon"" wich should come out between the 21 and the 28 of june 2005Let's come back to the mixtape ; you've got some two songs from tony's solo , his first single "" so seductive"" feat. 50 cent and ""live by the gun"" produced by Dr.dre the rest of the mixtape is made of G-unit songs with tony yayo , tony's verses in some songs ( like ""hate it or love it"" g-unit remix )freestyle from jail ( Rikers Island ) where he disses Ja rule ,Benzino and The Source exclusive interviews and two bonus songs including ""twist it"" from olivia feat.

3,A SOMEWHAT FLAWED HERO,"This is a very well written book, but I take issue with some of the comments. For example, Newman is described as a Tory, just like that. Newman was a Liberal in politics (he hated Disraeli Tory policies) but not, of course, in religion.Although Roland Hill is obviously very sympathetic towards his subject, the book in the end did not quite endear me to Lord Acton: in private, he was harsh in his judgements of other people.The Foreword states: ""He [Roland Hill] is sympathetic to that liberal Catholicism towards which Acton, with whatever oddities or overstatements, pointed the way."" The Acknowledgements by Roland Hill make his (Hill's) stance even clearer: ""I admired [Mathew] ... for his liberal views on Catholic matters.""If you are a liberal Catholic you will probably like this book. If you are a true Catholic, you will not like aspects of it. Nevertheless, an interesting read if approached with caution."
4,safety,"This heater should be used with a ground faultdevice. Very shocking if it becomes defective.One I had, three years old, shorted out. I foundout why the horeses weren't drinking out of thisparticular water tank when I stuck my finger into thewater!!!"
5,This purchase was for a replacement for an identical heater that gave me 5 years of dependable service.,The best thing about this heater is that it only requires being submerged in the bird bath and plugged into an electrical receptacle to operate.
2,defective,i bought a couple and they are defective. but there is a bright side! the plastic inside the handle breaks off and you have a blade without a handle but use some industrial glue like what you use on your windshield on your car and Valhalla!! you got a bad ass knife. the seller was a helpful. good customer serviceknife is HUGE btw
3,Does the job,nothing fancy about this item. My jar opener came and it was this ugly beige color. The jar opener itself is just a thin piece of rubber. It is not like the round ones I had growing up that had the inner rubber webbing to grab hold of. If you are just needing a jar opener on the fly and not wanting to spend much money then this is a safe bet. I am just a little worried about how long this will actually last since it is soooooo thin.
3,It's functional,The product if functional and standard. The one I received in the mail was plain white without any logo. It's what I would expect for the price. Bought it to replace a free marketing one I'd had for years that became damaged - and the new one is equivalent to the free one.
3,Just ok,For some reason I'm not getting good grips with this product. It may just have to be worn in some...It's just ok.
5,Great product.,Such a simple device that works like a champ. It provides just the right amount of force to open those pesky jars.
5,The MUST have book on tying,"This is a must read book for the beginner.It tells all about the tools needed for tying. It talks about hooks tying materials.Then goes on about the fly types from nymph , mayfly. caddis, stone flies and streamers. It talks about salmon flies, terrestrials,bass bugs and salt water flies.The chapter I liked was the one on beginner tying practice. I have been tying flies for thirty years and I relearned stuff that I had forgotten about, not too mention the fly patterns in this book.This book is a MUST have in any tier's library."
1,Mr. Richey,Warning... this was NOT a two row radiator as advertised! When the item arrived I got a single row radiator instead of the two row as advertised.
3,Does its job - but makes room hot!,"I bought this when I was living in New Jersey. It is my first dehumidifier and I may have been expecting too much.It removes plenty of moisture and works great. When the bucket is full it shuts itself off. You have the option of connecting it to a hose and let it run indefinitely with no water collection. Don't set it on max, because a room that is TOO dry is also uncomfortable. You can set it as low as 40% humidity, and can increase this in increments of 10% to Max.Main problem is that it runs very hot. It will heat the room in which it is placed. On a hot humid day the last thing you want is a hotter dry day. This is not one of those units you would want to put in your bedroom.It is not really quiet. I don't know if it is quieter than other dehumidifiers, but it produces the same amount of sound as a room air-conditioner."
1,Not happy.,"Purchaced unit for basement and it worked great for the first year & 1/2 but it no longer works properly. It seems the compressor doesnt work any longer. Fan works and the compressor is running just not getting the radiator cold to remove the moister, just sucking my electricity. I had to switch back to my old unit that I have had for approx 12 years and still works great once I fixed the switch. wish they still made them like that. LG is loosing in my mind. my 1 year old LG dishwasher is starting to piss me off now. NO MORE LG"
2,Stops working after two years,"I had purchased the first one about 4 years ago. It did work well and did what is was supposed to do. I felt that it was not easy to dispose the water that gets collected in the container. Though it looks good and did its job, my main problem is it stops working after couple of years.I again bought the same brand couple of years ago. It stopped working again now. The next one I am going to try something else. I do not believe this product is reliable. I thinks this also makes more sound, but since I did not try others yet, don't know if others will be better."
1,Awful quality,"I bought this as a reconditioned item. However, when it never works from the beginning, I have my doubts about this companies work. Even after we called customer service and followed their instructions it would not work. By the way, Customer Service instructions did not even come close to what the handbook indicated. I can not risk trusting this company again."
1,Poorly Written,"OK, before I go too far, I must admit that I haven't finished this book. I've made it through chapter 4 and I can't go any further. I can't stand it when authors start to talk about something and then tell me I can find the rest of the information in ___ chapter. I also find many of his statements redundant and unneeded. I LOVE biographies and I LOVE books about special needs (I'm a special education teacher), so I was so excited about reading this book. This book was nowhere near as enjoyable as other biographies and not even close to being as informative as other books about autism. If you want a biography that includes information about autism, choose one of Temple Grandin's. If you want a book about Jefferson, choose another!"
2,Mary - parent of autistic son,"While I agree that Thomas Jefferson was autistic, I think that Mr. Ledgin goes on and on for at least 200 pages more than necessary. I think he proves his point in the first few paragraphs. Going on and on with tiny details that no one cares about just makes me think that Mr. Ledgin is probably somewhere on the autistic spectrum as well.This would have made a very good magazine article. Way to long and dry for anyone but the most devoted fan to read."
2,disappointed,I purchased this pump for my turbod B16a2 when it actually would kick on it ran like a rapped ape i figured it was an issue with my pgm-fi relay at first so when i finally got the chance to dive into my car i put a new one in and still nothing i just hope the new one last alot longer to be honest
5,Worked right away.. created a menued DVD in under 1 hour,"I had no problems with this. I have 1 GB of RAM (windows XP) with dual-core processors and believe I would benefit from adding some ram. The only reason I give it 4 / 5 (vs 5/5) is because the software is a little anti-intuitive. Overall, it is definitely worth the cost."
1,Caused me considerable work restoring my computer,"Installing the software for this thing caused my SQL Server instance to drop all its databases and reset the system administrator password. If that isn't enough, the videos it captured were full of snow and interferance.Over the last 15 years I've bought a lot of computer stuff, but I gotta say that this thing is by far the worst. Its a discredit to Amazon that they even sell this item."
1,Do not buy,Garbage pure and simple. Hardware was broken out of the box and the Software would not install (hangs on setup). Double whammy - two goats for the price of one.This is my second capture device from Pinnacle - first one lasted about 3 months before it died.Avoid their products at all costs.Returning mine for refund - will never buy Pinnacle again.
3,Well researched and relevant,The book points out the general direction of the mobile industry and analyzes some of the reasons why. Good for anyone looking to develop strategy and tactics for the mobile business.
3,Useful!,"I found it very useful and it let me know concepts, tips and much more stuff about Mobile. I can tell that is an elemental tool for people who work in relationed jobs."
3,In need of a update :(,"Over all I was disappointed in this book, Most examples ref 2004 to 2005 technology. I kept asking myself just how far Mobil Marketing has come in the last 4 years. I did find the information informative if not dated. Bottom line is .. would I buy this book again? and I have to say no."
2,Cute but too fragile for everyday use,"My husband and I put these on our wedding registry and received two sets of six. We now have only two bowls left. A few cracked in the dishwasher, but several others have just turned up cracked without our knowing what caused it. It's too bad -- we registered for them because they are the perfect size for desserts and snacks, and their shape makes them stackable (although stacking them may have caused some of the cracks). We wanted something nice-looking but durable and easy to clean and store. These seemed to fit the bill, but they've turned out to be too fragile for everyday use. We'll be replacing them with another product."
4,"Very pretty, but very fragile","The vendor sent them immediately, and in good condition, except two of the rims of the bowls (dessert size) were not quite chipped, but not smooth to the touch. All of the rims are very fragile. I'm not sure how long they will last because of their fragility, but I do like them. I am keeping them. Just beware, they are quite fragile."
3,starting to break,"I have had these for several months now and I have enjoyed them and felt that they were a good product. They look pretty for serving small portions of fruit, dessert, or side dishes in. However, all of a sudden lately they have started to break easily after using them for quite some time. I don't know if this is from putting them in the dishwasher regularly or what. They have not been handled particularly roughly. They seem to have weakened in strength over time. I would not buy anymore and will have to find something else sturdier to replace them."
4,Indiana Jones,"Like always, I check out my games' reviews. Then I buy it. I always think, ""Is this worth the money becuase it is a lot of money?"" This is the best hand to hand combat game I have ever played and the funest. (I play a lot of action games) It is a great adventure/action game in my in my opinion. In the beginning it teaches you all kinds of moves and starts you off easy. Then it goes to actually thinking like Indiana Jones. But it doesn't drive you crazy until you pull your hair out. It is a big game and I would recommend buying it. (I did buy it and it is awesome!)"
4,Good concept and storyline,"This game has a good concpet and storyline, and it plays better than Tombraider, since I am a fan of Indy. The only reason it did not get a 5 star is that it is BUGGY. It seemed it was rushed out of production with very little QC. The perspective sometimes would not be correct, and Indy could walk through walls, or being shot through walls. They could do a bit better on the graphics, since there are still quite a few polygons here and there. Overall it is easy to get started without reading the manual and the controls are easy to remeber and learn. I bought this along with Metal Gear Solid II and I found myself playing this more than the MGSII."
2,Indy? How bad can it be? Oh.....,"Long wait but you knew it would be good. But it isn't.Can't save - This is incredible- repeat, repeat, repeat. Missedthe last of 12 jumps? Back to the first.Controls- Terrible - Hence the repeating problem. It's onething to miss a tough action but another to have to work withterrible controls.Will wait for Tombraider and avoid Lucas in the future. How could anything this bad take so long? Hey, did you guys outsource this? The product was overdue, and is poor quality.Your reputation just took a beating. Next time hire professionals."
3,"Pretty Graphics, Frustrating Game Play","I was excited by the prospects of a new Indy game. This one has dazzling graphics, very good sound, and a rich story line.The game play, though, tarnishes the experience. Lacking a mid-level save fuction, you're doomed to repeat tedious sequences again and again. Also, Indy easily falls off of things and gets himself stuck in tight spaces while the bad guys are attacking. Underwater movement is especially frustrating because of the extra element of air supply.Pay attention to the system requirements, as processor and graphics requirements are high."
3,Questionable?,"It could have been a better game, though some levels were real fun. Sound became real choppy and Indy couldn't be controlled well when alot of action was happening in the game, that was very disappointing, at the least distracting. Rent first."
3,A fun game,"Not a bad game I would give it a 3.5 star rating. The graphics are so so, the sound is decent, and the plot could be another movie. This is like an Indy movie but with alot more bad guys.I don't really like the whole sharks and alligators bit, since a run in with them would be completely fatal. Nor did I like the whole kraken thing. It is worth the money now, but it does have very little replay value."
2,Demo not the same as actual game,"I bought this game at Target along with my X-Box unit. I played approximately an hour and a half of thie game. I don't recommend the game for beginning video players and for those who like good graphics.First, in the second section of the Ceylon portion of the game, the Indy character enters a pool of water. He is expected to find his way into the ruined temple. I spent considerable time attempting to get the character to move past this point without success. I believe a more experienced gamer may have better luck. I know the reviewers at GameSpot could pass this point. (They rated the game a 6.6.)Second, the graphics are bad. I have seen instances of Indy's arm, leg, or torso enter a wall or a plant.Tomorrow, I am exchanging my game for a better game."
4,Matt's Review,"I first played this game several years ago when it first came out. I'm a big Indy fan and found the game entertaining, but like what some of the other people said, you do have to start the level over if you die, which is frustrating, though I like the game better than Infernal Machine and Staff of Kings. Infernal Machine was way too long and tedious, and Staff of Kings was way too short. I could play through it in under five hours. Emperor's Tomb was not too short and not too long but just right. When you are ready to move on to something else, the game ends."
2,Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb,This game is god awful. The controls stink while the game play is medicore. The worse thing about the controls is that it's too flaky and unpolished. The controls are extremely sensitive and at times very unresponsive. The camera angle is even worse. You can face looking into inside of a wall. Yup.. inside of a wall. The camera angel is right up there with the controls as making this game GOD AWFUL. I expect more from Lucas Arts to make a game unfinish and unenjoyable as this.
5,Great Game,I played the demo of this game and the game play is a blast. The graphics are pretty good and the sound is great. If you like a fun action game that is really close to the idiana jones movies then I would buy this game.
2,Indiana Jones and The Emporer's Tomb.,"Very good gameplay.Controls-- fluid.Graphics A-ok. I just can't say the game was too exciting though. Too much walking around. Although if you like Tomb Raider. (which I did not,);Sorry crazy tomb-raider like people. ..GO for it. My pick for best X-box game of the last couple weeks is Medal of Honor. Awesome game, I can't say enuf. Advice. Toke a few hits on a ""tobacco pipe,"" for some excitement. Nuff said. Not me cup o' tea."
2,buggy game play,this seems like a good game overall except for all the bugs. there are serious programing errors. the game locks up periodically and does not let you continue. this is especially frustrating when you complete a level and have to start it over when the cut scene crashes. lucasarts probably should have playtested it more. without the bugs i would say 4 stars.
4,Great fun for starters...,"I have to agree with the other reviewers about the problems with this game - not being able to save (very irritating if you die at the end of a level and have to start the whole thing again) and the game freezing at inopportune moments - although it was a relief to discover that it was the game and not my Xbox causing the problem...But despite all this, I still really enjoyed the game. The graphics are excellent - the controls easy to master and the music matched the action incredibly well. Indy really does look like and sound Harrison Ford and parts of the game are based on the actual movies which makes it fun as well. The die hard gamers seem to have found the game very frustrating with the issues that crop up, but if you're not too serious then this game can keep you happily occupied for hours - it did me!"
2,Too basic for neurology resident.,May be beter for medical students but definitely not sufficient for neurology resident.Very basic information.For neurology residents there are better books to buy.Everything is in stories when you want pointers on call.
2,QUITE BORING,"I have this DVD and the last time I watched it was well over a year ago. Every set looks the same as the last and it's just so dull. It should have been gorier and milked it's hardly original concept for all it's worth. The dialogue simply stinks too. Jerry Goldsmith's music is below par also which is strange for him. All you get on this non-anamorphic DVD is a trailer. Watch out for Sommers' next movie ""The Mummy"" it's also garbage. Some nice effects though."
4,Action-packed!,"A crew of Highjackers led by Treat Williams go into a ship where the passengers suddenly have disappeared but only find one surviving passenger ( Famke Jannsen), they all must survive and escape the ship from a deadly prehistoric monster that is attacking the ship.It's got a farfetched plot but this movie is very entertaining and gory at times. The monster itself is cool looking, the action keeps going making this a enjoyable feast of blood and action.Also recommended: Titanic, Ghost Ship, Die Hard, Leviethan, Deep Star Six, Deep Blue Sea, Alien Resurrection, Aliens, From Dusk Till Dawn, Total Recall, Starship Troopers, Die Hard 2, Con Air, The Rock, The Toxic Avenger, Slugs, The Beginning of the End, Jaws, Lake Placid, Alien, Predator, and Total Recall."
5,This is how to make a good movie,"This is my favorite movie. The plot is good, the effects are excellent, the action is solid. The cast is superb. Treat Williams, Famke Janssen, Wes Studi, Trevor Goddard, Kevin J O'Connor, and the rest combine to form one of the most wonderful casts ever. This movie is a pleasure to watch over and over again."
1,not happy,"hello. I was very dissapointed for the DVD will not view on my home system, Saying i Have the wrong region.I did send inquires on this and received no response to the matter.I have 2 DVD that I can not watch because they are region 2 (europe). I am region 1..North America..USA.will can you help me now"
2,Just when you thought it was safe!? :),When you thought it was safe to check out horror/sci-fi films from the 90s boy were you wrong. The 90s was probably the worse era for horror and sci-fi films easily. A lot of those kind of movies from that era lack creativity and originality in a big way. This movie really has nothing to offer rather than a big caboom a very digitalized and cheesy looking monster; and a boring cast. Hard to believe there is an actor in this movie that made an appearence in last of the mohegans.
3,survive this,"some good moments in a film directed by Stephen Sommers(directed the dreadful Mummy movies). this one is his best one so far with Treat Williams and Wes Studi and Studi's shipmates and Williams crew go and highjack a luxury cruiseliner but find something different on board thats eatting alive all the crew. so they race against time and try to stop it and survive. Kevin J. O'Connor sparks some laughs alongside Williams. dont get to caught up in the moment, the beast at the end is stupid but the ship exploding is great and Anthony Heald is way funky in this pic."
5,"""If the cash is there we do not care.""","An entertaining B-movie and a sign of things to come from director Sommers. Fast-paced, good performances from Treat Williams, Wes Studi, and, of course, the always beautiful Famke Janssen. Maybe not as good something like TREMORS, it does have that kind of feel and is a good ride. Don't look for more and you won't be disappointed. Is is just me or is Kevin J. O' Connor the human equivalent of finger nails on a blackboard?"
3,Pure Fun!,This film is a lot of fun to watch. Just suspend disbelief for a while and simply go with the flow.
5,Non-Stop Guilty Pleasure,"""Deep Rising"" is one of those guilty pleasures. Even though it borrows from so many flicks (""Alien,"" ""Poseidon Adventure,"" etc.), it is nonetheless a very entertaining roller coaster ride of a movie. It starts quick and never lets up. Lots of tight and involving action sequences; good (if not great) special effects; and a cast of some good and awful actors! I had a hoot watching it. The monster was pretty awesome, and the villains certainly deserved what they got. Wes Studi's final scene is one of the most vile characterizations in modern horror films. Kevin O'Connor is very enjoyable in his whiny supporting role. My favorite of his many one-liners: ""Can you just catch asthma?"". Treat Williams is a good anti-hero and Anthony Heald is awful as the main villain, but you can't help waiting for him to get his! The rest of the cast is typical and adequate, although I think poor Wes Studi couldn't have gotten much more ""wooden"". All in all, one of those great B-movies of the 90's!"
4,"CONTRIVED TO SAY THE LEAST, BUT STILL A FUN HEART POUNDING EXPERIENCE!","It's hard to put this movie down, as it tries so hard to pay homage to the sci-fi and horror movies from the past. This film borrorws from several other movies like 'Alien' and 'Poseidon Adventure', but it is one heck of a ride. The action is tense, Rob Botton's(The Thing remake)FX are very good and just the right amount of tongue and cheek humor thrown in to make this a very good monster movie, that's right up there with the original 'Tremors'.....not quite. The DVD transfer looks good, but this film deserves an upgrade with some interesting extra material."
3,A Giant Squid That Eats People!,"Enjoyable movie about a squid that eats a cruise ship full of people. Treat Williams is a decent action hero and Famke Janssen is a good female lead. The dialogue is funny, crisp and the direction from Stephen Sommers is good. I was satisfied with the action and also liked Sommers' ""Mummy"" pictures. Plenty of special effects to grab attention from the most maniacal science-fiction fans. A good movie!"
4,"Good, braindead solid action!","This movie is among my favourite ones. It's not a good movie if you look on the story side, but what the heck: Don't we all need to see some real action with excellent one-liners and big evil monsters? Of course we do! And this movie delivers it all!"
4,Titanic Is Invaded evil worm-like aliens,"You must see Deep Rising. If you are a Sci-FI fan this is the hot tamale(though if you did not like Alien the movie I do not recommend this movie). The blood and gore is throughout the whole movie, so if your stomach is uneasy Deep Rising is not for you. A great action thriller about a boat driver who drives a bunch of theives to a Titanic like boat. But when the convicts arrive the find thal all the passengers had allready been robbed....of their lives. The rest is for you to find out. A must see Sci- Fi thriller."
3,"A MONSTER FROM THE DEEP ATTACKS THE ""NEW TITANIC!""","BLOODY, GORY, AND EXTREMELY INTENSE, DEEP RISING REALLY DELIVERS THE ACTION! THE SEA MONSTER IN THE FILM CONSUMES EVERYONE ON BOARD THE ""TITANIC-LIKE SHIP"" WITH ITS NUMBEROUS TENTICLE FEEDERS AND LEAVES NO ONE ALIVE ONBOARD. BUT AT THE END THE CREATURE GETS WHATS COMING TO HIM. IT'S A MUST SEE IF YOU LIKE GORY SCI-FI ACTION MOVIES!"
4,fantastic fun if your looking for nothing serious!,"Deep Rising was a truly entertaining film. I knew it wouldn't be an Oscar nominee, but that didn't stop me from being really surprised at how much i enjoyed this aliens meets titanic film. Totally over the top with light miniguns, the heroes and monster fodder take on a horde of nasty deep see monsters out for a picnic of human flesh. Treat Williams plays the cool hero, so cool in fact he never breaks even the smallest sweat throughout the whole movie while everyone else is panting away just as if they had run a one minute mile. After a million rounds of ammo expended, lots of gruesome deaths and splattered monsters the movie ends with what else, but a chance for a sequel. I hope it gets made because Deep Rising is deffinately one of those movies you have to see just for the fun of it."
2,bad monster movie,"The story is just ""monster eats up almost everyone on the boat, and some bravely escaped from it and destroyed it with a big explosion). But I finished it by killing the time."
2,Bleauch!,"Stephen Sommer's oh-how agonisingly-predictable monster movie (which owes a lot to James Cameron's ALIENS) is as un-original as they come. Blunty, it's a rehash of of the old corny ""monster at sea"" movies. Nothing suprised me, except for a couple of impressive special effects. And did anyone mention plausability? This is so uninvolving and lacklustre it borders on the excremental. Only some inventive stuff with that gooey creature offing people eliviated my interest, but the rest is boring drivel."
1,Movie was crap,"Don't know how anyone can like this movie, i saw it on TNT late night. Some of those movies are good, but this one wasn't one of those, it was just plain stupid."
3,Silly but grossly entertaining.,"Deep Rising is one of those nonsense movies I've seen. If the producer is trying to impress the viewer with the gruesome sea monster in the movie, then he succeeded. Visual graphics & sound performance for the DVD is absolutely astounding. Other than that, it's silly."
1,Bad in a bad way,"The studios make lots of trash that gets buried in unmarked graves, showing up on local channels with lots of commercial interruptions (but showing the same couple of commercials over and over), leading us to wonder, ""was this movie ever in theatres?"" This movie is just bad. It is very suspicious that this unremarkable bad movie should attract so many reviews, and that they are overwhelmingly positive. There are a few inexpensive special effects created with care (the ocean liner model that gets blown up, the computer graphic tentacle monster). The monster is an extremely slithery version of the alien in Alien, you know, it opens an orifice in what is supposed to be its head and then there's another head (or whatever). Every time the creature bursts into a room, it looks the same. The riding around on the jet ski in the boat at the end is some terrible low budget movie making. Not a classic bad movie, but bad enough to regret wasting time watching it."
3,GOOD SPECIALS EFFECTS,"The creature effects created by Rob Bottin and industrial light & magic are great but the story is really ordinary; the actors are medium and the direction isn't under control. If you love monsters movie with action but no story, buy this movie"
3,Not Bad,"If you like the monsters movies, you will enjoy this one because the specials effects are fantastic but the script is really bad. It's a kind of movie you see one time and after you forget."
4,Calamari Baby!,"Everybody dies you know. Especially in this hilarious movie about a cruise ship that is eaten by a giant squid. Who can stop this squid? Treat Williams, YES! He was incredible in ""The Phantom"" another masterpiece and he proves himself in this movie. Axes to the face, ladies getting sucked into toilets and crazy guys puking into buckets are some of the funny highlights in this Stephen Sommers epic. Just when you think this movie can't get any better, they throw in Famke Janssen, the most beautiful lordess ever and you have the ultimate movie. I was enlightened after watching this movie."
4,i liked it,"this movie was great in my opinion. it had good special effects average acting about the right lenght, good storyline. the only problem i have with this movie is the end. they just get done with destroying the alligators and then at the end there on a island with some other monster. but still is a watchable movie. i would just rent however."
3,Done the way Godzilla should have been!!,"Good character development, great directing bySteven Sommers, and a great cast made this flickthe mindless fun that Godzilla should have beenbut was not. Instead of focusing heavily on plot,Mr. Sommers (who also wrote this film) developedcharacters and wreaked havoc on the audience withplenty of action. Sure it was predictable, but itwas supposed to be. This movie was not intendedin any way to be a suspense film. This is betterexplained with the film's comical ""full screamahead"" tagline.I could say more about this film, but I won'tspoil it for you. It was meant to be nothing butpure, mindless fun and I got EXACTLY what Iexpected from it. Good stuff."
2,Deep Waste,Good effects but weak story line. Lots of great effects and sound (DVD). Movie not worth the time except for beauty of Famke Janssen who isn't on screen all that much
3,Deep Rising is extremely entertaining and some what fun.,"Deep Rising's director, Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, Adventures of Huckle Berry Finn), seems to always have a serious/tongue-in-cheek comedy horror film put together. I recently saw the Mummy returns and wow was that corny. Deep Rising is good enough to watch over and over again but has a terrible plot, pethetic actors and some of the stupidest dialogue I have ever heard. Awesome monster effects though and cool idea. I'm very glad Stephen didn't entitle this film, ""Tentacles"", ""Deep Rising"" is more creative."
5,This movie really scared me,When I watch a monster/horror movies I want to be scared. This movie does just that. It's not the most original story but it is great fun to watch. It builds the tension from the very first and gets scarier and more gory as the story progresses. You really have no idea what the monster really is until the classic scene where the hero confronts it. The special effects are excellent(expected) and original(rare). The movie is visually beautiful and the soundtrack is very good. I would like to have seen more development of the love interest between the two characters but that is not the reason you see a movie like this. Shakespere in Love this is not. This is a very fun movie with no redeeming value and there is nothing wrong with that.
3,"""CREATURE FEATURE"" FAN HUGELY DISSAPOINTED","I am a massive fan of monster/creature movies, therefore, I really looked forward to seeing this movie. However, when the end credits finally scrolled, I can only describe myself as being dissapointed. Sure the effects were okay (but did still seem a bit computer generated) and the movie does offer its fair share of gore; I even liked the idea behind the story 'prehistoric sea creature attacks ocean liner'. But I really didn't like the script, it was just too corny, the acting is unconvincing and the movie didn't build enough suspense. It would have been much better had the film concentrated more on the creature attacking the ship rather than the annoying rag tag bunch of crims that make up the film's cast. Still the movie is fairly enjoyable for a one off viewing but I definately reccommend renting before you buy."
2,Citizen Black eagle,"Price on the watch is fair. Delivery is very good. The watch itself is nice however, after wearing the watch for a couple of days the plating on the band comes off and look cheap. A watch priced at that level should not have that kind of problem - disapointing.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQU0Y6/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
4,Classic aviator watch,"I've had this watch for about 3 months. I bought it at a wholesale club for about what Amazon is selling it for now.The watch has a nice heft. It was a little difficult to set but has run flawlessly since. The watch band tends to pull hairs but removing a link or two cures that problem.My only suggestion for improvement would be some type of backlighting for the watch face or at least the digital display. The digital display is difficult to see since the LCD is somewhat gray on a black background.All in all, I'm glad I bought this watch. I have two other Citizens, one other an Eco-Drive, and I've been very pleased with their performance.UPDATE - ONE YEARMy opinions haven't changed. Several reviewers have commented on the black paint coming off. I've noticed this on the clasp but not elsewhere and I wear this watch for everyday use. It keeps time very well. Multiple time zones are handy for international travel. I would still highly recommend this timepiece."
2,Big Disappointment,"Not what I was expecting. You can't manually set the time - the analog time is governed by the digital time. No matter how I tried, I could not get the watch to set to the correct time. It was 4 minutes fast. The directions are not user friendly and there is no telephone number to call for assistance. This puppy is going back."
4,awesome,"ive had my watch for almost four years. it has withstood everyday wear and tear. the black plating does fade, but over time slowly. it is a great watch. my analog time is off from the digital time. but all i do is set the time to three time zones ahead, and its fine.should get it fixed... but oh well.i have not had the battery changed for 3.5 years.the crystal is very hard to scratch.solid almost invincible watch"
4,Great Watch,"I love this watch. Great features and the quality appears to be first class. It looks more expensive than it actually is. I have many watches and most with so many things on the face are difficult to read in low light but the contrast on this watch is great. The GMT and slide rule is perfect for us pilots. It is a large and heavy watch but is very comfortable and never having to change a battery makes it worth it.I gave it a four out of five for some very minor problems. The crown is difficult to pull out without taking it off and when it is turned there is a little ""tick"" feel rather than a satisfying ""click"" you would expect from a watch of this quality. Secondly, the volume of the alarm is a little low making it hard to hear anywhere except a quite room. This might be attributed to many hours behind the prop.Even knowing this I would purchase this watch again without question."
2,Not durable or reliable,"I am about to send this watch back for the third time in about 2 years. 1st time, watch would not zerorize (digital time constantly off analog time). Second time analog hands wouldn't even match up to zerorize, came back with new chip but lower mode dial not quite centering. Then the mode dial fell off a few months later, so now it's on it's third trip back. Not sure if I would invest in the steel clasp -- pins seem to have bent a bit and the black wears off the casing.I am a professional pilot and bought this watch to wear everyday, but I don't think it's durable enough to be worn by actual pilots."
5,"Great watch, nice price","I was looking for a watch for travel.One that didn't look too casual, but not too expensive.This watch was what I was looking for.Nice functions and looks.The only problem is that you have to go to a jeweler in order for it to be fitted, they should provide a do-it-yourself tool."
5,A Modern Day Messiah....,"Okay, that may have been a little strong, but it is a damn entertaining book. It is a quick read. As a fan of Modern Drunkard Magazine....I tore through this book like a jackal on downed water buffalo. In the vast wasteland of political correctness, it is nice to see a man embrace being a drunk with such zeal. God bless you Frank, I will pour you a drink in heaven....or wherever our kind goes when we die."
2,Ehhhh.. I've had better,"I love these drinking ""how to"" books but this one was kinda boring, long, and was used language that was based in like the 1940's. I actually stopped reading it for a while and could only read a part of one chapter at a time. And it just got worse and worse as the book went on."
5,undiscovered genius,"Frank Kelly Rich is what you get when you take Maddox, Tucker Max, and Charles Bukowski and combine them into one glorious book about everything that is great about drinking. This is one of the few books I've read that makes you laugh out loud on almost every page. The buzzwords for boozeheads chapter is nothing short of nuanced genius. And the juicing on the job chapter is one of the more enjoyable pieces you will ever read. Modern Drunkard quietly and continuously puts out some of the best writing on the internet and this book is a testament to the fact that some of most talented writers in America still operate beneath the radar. I couldn't recommend it more."
4,Recycled Material,"This is an excellent book but I was a little disappointed to see that it was mostly recycled material. I am a subscriber to the Modern Drunkard magazine and it seems this paperback is a collection of their most amusing articles and such.Nevertheless, it's absolutely worth purchasing, especially for those of you whom are not aware of the magazine's existance. It is laugh-out-loud funny, informative (believe-it-or-not) and encouraging for those of us who continue to lead a shameless life of debauchery."
1,I wish i could give this zero stars,"I was so shocked at the poor quality and irreverent nature of this item, it is garbage for your brain. I have purchased documentaries from BBC before and was equally disapointed. From now on I will stay away."
1,Typical stuff from the BBC,"This program is total trash. The BBC has made a side business of attacking historic Christian faith. I dare them to cast their postmodern polemics against Islam, but they won't do it because they are intellectually dishonest and cowards."
5,Mysteries of the Apostles,"The fisrt part, on St. Peter, is a very successful blend of archaeology and Biblical tradition. It's excellent, and it makes heavy use of the Apocryphal New Testament from Nag Hammadi in Egypt, but, for the first time I've ever seen, in a positive way.The second, on St. Paul, is good, but probably tries too hard with science and archaeology where it doesn't really fit in with the Biblical traditions.The final part, on the ""Revelations"" / Apocalypse is great, and long overdue. It shows that this last book of the NT was NOT a prediction of the future (an idea that's misled countless people over the centuries) but a message only relevant in the ancient author's own time. And it seems that the nasty number is NOT 666 after all !"
5,A must have for all Marines !!!!!!!!!,This is a book for all Marines. Well done and the pictures are GREAT !!!!! Please print more.
2,Not complaining about content...but condition,"We, of course bought this book used, but were trying to replace an exact copy we had. The picture we chose from showed us the the new leather bound cover. The one that came was canvas, and the book seller said the copy we bought was in very good condition. Well, the one we recieved was not only canvas, the binding was broken, and taped together with scotch tape! I don`t consider a taped up book to be in ""very good"" shape!!!"
2,Humes & Berg 153 Trombone Cleartone Mute,"This mute has a LOT of back pressure....and the way it fits in my horn, it raises the pitch almost a full half step. So you might have to play with the cork ring thickness to adjust how far into the bell the mute sits. I'd rather just use my Dennis Wick Harmon mute."
2,Nature's Answer Periowash,This product was recommended by the dental hygenist as a product that worked well for another patient of her's. I found the taste of this product so awful that I found myself not using it at all. So I will never know if the benefits of it were beneficial as I just could not stomach the taste of this product.
2,It's ok,"Nice flavor, all natural. Just didn't last too long. I recently purchased another oral rinse (Oragne lid, green bottle) that knocks this clear out the competition. It's ok I guess."
5,Awesome!,This product has all the right ingredients to make it high effective. Girlfriend and daughter love it and use it over alcohol based products.I bought 3-5 more just to stock up on at this decent price!You don't need to be a health freak or holistic healer to realize the power of this product. Just read the ingredients!
5,The Mouthwash of all Mouthwashes!!!,"Packed with great & healthy ingredients, this mouth wash leaves your mouth feeling fresh and you can rest easy that all of the nasty chemicals in other mouth washes are not present in this one. Clean mouth and piece of mind in one bottle! Highly recommend!"
5,Natural,I was having trouble with dry mouth and this product has really helped.. I am an organic type of gal and this mouthwash gives me everything I am looking for
1,Gives me a stomach ache,"I've tried this mouth wash three times and each time ended up with a stomach ache, so I discontinued use. I was really hoping to find a natural mouth wash, but this isn't it for me."
3,Reminds me of skoal dip...,I used to dip tobacco and this tastes almost the same...can't believe I used to swallow that stuff. The Cool Mint version of this product tastes much better.
4,Better than the competition,"It's not as harsh or chemically as the main stream mouth washes, yet after a bit you can feel it really do a good job. My breath stays fresh for awhile."
5,great,"this product is the 2nd one I purchased love theproduct, except this one that I received was not the same ""strength as the first one I purchased. I called Natures answer direct and the rep contacted me back explaining that it must have ome from different batches of product and she will gladky send me a complimentary bottlle to replace that one.......haven not rec'd it as yet.....3 wks......."
1,Quality is very Cheap!,I bought this thinking the quality would be good! I am writing this review for only 1 reason so that Users like me don't waste their money as I did. Quality is so cheap that it just broke in a day! Stay away Guys this is complete waste of money.
4,not what i thought but still nice,"I was so upset with the local beauty supply store when they stopped stocking TIGI make-up. I love loose powder and the powder that came in this container was amazing and lasted forever. I ordered this thinking it was regular, but it did clearly say shimmer. It kind of reminds me of Edward in Twilight -lol- I joke that i have sparkly skin, but it's fairly subtle and still works great for powder."
3,Not a bad adaptation.,"Cliche to say, but the book was better! The show could have stood to have some better direction and pacing, and less music and melodrama. It's actually all right besides, though! Has one of the better depictions of gay men in anime, but that's not saying much giving the medium's consistently poor representation of the demographic. Again, not the best, but there are much, MUCH worse out there. Consider giving it a shot. Hopefully we will someday see more adaptations of Antique Bakery's original author's work such as ""What Did You Eat Yesterday?"" or ""The Moon and Sandals""."
1,typical,"This book is typical of the thinking in the late '70s. They are big on face-to-face confession, and laying on of hands for absolution, which are being abandoned in the wake of sexual abuse problems."
5,Supports Windows XP x64,"It's a great card for the price. Manufacturer provides drivers for Windows x64, and that was the reason I bouth this card."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM!!!,"Landscape and garden designers, whether amateur or professional, are STRONGLY CAUTIONED against buying this product. In addition to being difficult to use, it contains numerous bugs. The program will crash repeatedly, even with the most current computer equipment and video drivers. Worst of all, it has a tendency to crash and produce an irretrievably ""corrupt"" file when a plan has gotten large and detailed. This then prevents that file from ever being used, and it cannot be reversed. This happened to this review's writer after having invested over two weeks of work on a landscape design. Broderbund software tech support could offer no help other than to state that this apparently happens all the time! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Very disappointing,"Clumsy, unstable program. Persistent crashes and lots of run-time errors. No one available at tech support. Not worth the trouble it takes to install."
1,"Sharon from Alexandria, VA","This is an extremely poor program with lots of bugs. The program often does not work, items added to your landscape often do not show up in all types of views, some ""jump around"" and become unattached to where you placed them. Often it is impossible to delete items that have been improperly placed. This product is NOT ready for sale. It needs a lot more work to remove all the bugs. This is an extremely fustrating and time consuming adventure, with very poor results. Further, the advertised ""see your landscape in different seasons"" doesn't work. I expected my deciduous trees to change colors and lose leaves. This didn't happen. I couldn't calculate my light for winter planting. I'm going to have to start over with other software."
1,Look Elsewhere!!,Not user friendly! Look elsewhere. Continues to lock-up with windows XP. The packaging is deceiving. Refused to honor rebate (no leeway for mail time).
2,"Some nice features, however a cumbersome tool","I purchased this software to help visualize basic landscaping ideas for my home. I found the overall usability to be poor. Simple things like grouping several plants and moving them together is not supported, the 'grow' feature didn't work in many cases, and the overall navigation is poor. I did like the 'arial' view that allows you to zoom over and around your plot and view plants in 3-D from all angles. I also liked the plant library to lookup and research basic information on plants. Overall, I'm disappointed with this product."
2,Total 3D Landscape Deluxe 3.0,"The program started lagging for me real bad after getting only a few things built. I'm using a 450 pentium with 256 meg ram and a 16 meg voodoo video card. The package came with a decent users manual and a small tutorial to get me started but don't expect to import a picture of your house and yard and start throwing shrubs and flowers into it. You'll have to cut sections of walls from a photo of your house, and remove obstacles such as tree limbs hanging in the photo and resize them to fit sections of walls on the house that you made inside the program. The complete yard will have to be constructed from scratch inside the program unless you want to use one of theirs. I was also surprised not to find the standard privacy fence and chain link fence in the fence section among other things. I keep going back to it and trying to give it another chance but the lag just kills me. On the upside. The program comes with a 90 day money back guarantee if your not satisfied."
1,Buy DIGS,"Spend the cash and buy Design Imaging Group, Inc software. www.designimaginggroup.com. It is expensive, powerful and works flawlessly. You cannot get good landscape design software cheaply. I have tried them all. Good luck."
2,Incompatable with Windows XP Professional,"Program crashes with Windows XP Professional. Other reviews indicate frequent crashes with other systems as well. You can spend a lot of time learning the program and entering your specific plan, only to go ""KABAM!"" Really a shame, since there seemed to be so much potential."
2,Won't see the CD Rom,"The program seems to have the right idea, but it crashes all the time and now I can't even get it to recognize the Data CD Rom while I'm running it. Real waste of time and disappointment."
1,Watch Out! - Inexplicable Double Images,"I am seldom moved to complain publicly about a piece of software, but Total 3D Landscape did not work properly on my plain vanilla Dell system running Windows 2000 with plain vanilla video. Working in 2-dimensional mode and placing plants in location, I got unwanteed duplicates of the plants 6 inches to the right on my screen. I'm one of those persons who has been fooling around with computers so long that I can fix almost anything. Not so with Total 3D Landscape. The program was completely unusable and simply not worth the more than two hours I wasted on reinstalling and searching for any possible mistake I might have made."
1,Do not buy the 4.0 version either,I bought the 4.0 version and it is user demonic. Do not buy this item.
1,THIS PROGRAM IS HORRIBLE,"Much like the other reviewers:The program crashes suddenly and without warning.That wouldn't bother me so much, but...When I save a pretty cool looking rendition of my house, it drops the windows from the saved file, making me have to start all over again.Not any more. I'm uninstalling it and complaining to CompUSA."
5,Like the old days!,"I bought these dvd's for my grandchildren-they are the same Richard Scarry shows my own kids grew up watching. The quality is ok-these dvd's aren't hd but they play just fine and the kids love them. A great bargain for so many episodes. There are bonus episodes of Busytown Mysteries on there as well. For the price, you can't go wrong. I love anything Richard Scarry-nice to know my grandkids can watch these over and over and I don't have to worry about any inappropriate content!"
5,Memories,I love reading Richard Scarry books. The video is great. It is nice to see the stories come to life.
4,Am I missing Something?,"My boys (ages 5/6) could not get past level one on this game. Some of the items that needed to be found, never made their appearance. I even tried. Perhpas we got a bad copy.I must say from a parent's point of view the music drove me nuts!!! Same little tune, played over and over....it never changes."
5,"What a joker, :)","Reading the review from Gordon Ehrensing had me cracking up so much I had to read the additional reviews this guy?? wrote on other products - and what do you know - it follows all the way through. Someone found an outlet for mischief, is sneaky about it and on top of it all there are people out there that find the reviews helpful. At least Gordon accomplished something. Congratulations - I hope you have just as much humor in real life. By the way, read his review on Sex and the City and give some attention to the names he used :)Other then that, I always enjoy the series. Hat off to Samantha, lets be truthful, isn't that what we all would love to do. No regrets and games!!!!!"
5,Makes Any Coffee Delish!,"It's sugar-free! This coffee-mate adds a sumptuous taste to any coffee whether it is flavored or not. The vanilla and caramel mix is lite but delicious! This product is really good and, once again, is sugar-free--a plus for the flavor."
5,Can't find in my area,"Personally, the best flavor in the Coffee-mate line. I' am border-line diabetic and this really works for me. Can't find it in my local stores"
5,Addictive,"Very delicious product! Would recommend it to anyone who cannot have sugar. Have to warn you though, it's very addictive!!"
4,Makes my wife happy in the morning,"The Amazon price isn't very impressive, but the ease of shopping on Amazon makes up for it."
3,Pleasant viewing - limited extras - of course no Rusty,"This was a nice DVD to watch, not great, but good. I agree some in the band could have used more rehearsing time - but all in all was interesting to view. My DVD also had the editing and sound issues. Not much in the way of extras.Cactus to me has always been about the guitar playing of Jim McCarty and he doesn't disappoint here. Carmine and Tim's reputation is well known (some good, some not so good) - but I was surprised at how much I missed the singing of Rusty Day. Jimmy tries hard - but I missed Rusty and it isn't quite the same without him.If you are into the nostalgia trip (and that's not terrible), this is a DVD to watch if you are a very big Cactus fan. Worth the price (to me) just to watch McCarty. If you are questioning where to spend your dollars on this band - get the first or second CD. Both are excellent (and the third isn't bad either)."
4,Cactus Rocks,"I was very excited when I saw this DVD for sale. Tim Bogert and Carmine Appice are two of the best musicians to come out of the sixty's and seventy's. I loved vanilla Fudge and Beck, Bogert and Appice, and Cactus. I thought overall it was a really good performance. I noticed some faulty editing and some defects in sound quality here and there. It seemed to jump from stereo to 5.1 in and out. Also the band probably should have rehearsed a little more as there were just a few moments when Carmine lost the grove on Rock and Roll Children and some of the endings seemed to just stop and hang there. I don't know if the sound problems were just defects on my disc, or just some not so good production. I would like to hear if any one else noticed this. However that being said, overall I very much enjoyed the show and Jimmy Kunes did a great job on vocals."
1,I Like Cactus More As A Plant,"I remembered I had some friends back in high school that were into these guys. I knew it had people that I liked from other bands in it. I wasn't sure who all was in this band. I've been picking up some things by bands that I never had the time or money to check out back then to see what I was missing. To my taste, I wasn't missing anything. I've heard this type of music done way better else where."
3,Relatively cheap construction,"Sound transfer isn't great here, but that isn't my major gripe; much cannot be expected of the miniplug. The bigger problem for me is the fact that the flimsy construction means exsposed bits of wire that should never see day-light end up seeing just that. As a product that is likely to see use with prosumer camcorders and thus will be lugged around a lot, build quality should simply be higher.Still, the mere fact that this is a tough product to come by and that it does open up a range of mics that would otherwise be unsuable with the mini-plug port, at a low price, earns a solid 3 stars."
2,Buyer Beware,"Beware!!!! This DVD is in HEBREW. If the child you are buying it for doesn't speak or understand the language, you will not be able to use it at all and Amazon will charge you postage to return it. I suppose I didn't read the information about the product well enough when I ordered it, so imagine my surprise when it arrived and I couldn't read a single word on the outside of the case! I knew it was either Hebrew or Yiddish. I checked and yes, when I scrolled down the description said the language was Hebrew. I don't remember reading that as I was ordering my Christmas gifts. I didn't realize something like a product in a language other than the one I am using when ordering wouldn't be part of the initial information given: at the top where it doesn't have to be searched for by the buyer! Innocent mistake or stupidity? All I know that I feel that the buyer better beware when dealing with Amazon. They don't allow for any mistakes on the buyers part."
1,Far Too Simplistic,"This book might work for someone who has never thought about goals and priorities, who is grossly overweight, and considers exercise evil.I'm twenty pounds overweight, eat less than a thousand healthy calories a day, and do mild exercise (I'm 57 and have had a heart attack). My doctors can't figure out why I gained weight. My nutritionist can't figure it out. They all just write it off as ""Oh, well, you're older and maybe your metabolism has slowed down."" Big help.I thought I'd learn something from this book that might enlighten me, but it's all just dirt-simple basic logic. If you know your motives, have set goals, and are aware of what you're doing and why, this book won't offer anything new. If you're trying to diet and exercise for the first time and are completely clueless, you may get something out of it."
4,Cute kit,"I got this kit without seeing a picture. The kit is a standard latch hook kit, it comes with the hook, yarn and mat. The pattern is a purple care bear with his arms open and a pink background.The grid is 15x12.It will make a cute pillow and is a great project for my 10 year old."
2,Don't bother if Windows is a client,"This book may be of value if you are trying to get two Symbian devices to communicate. But if you need to communidate with another OS, it is sorely lacking.The book leaves out very critical info on using RNetDatabase in order to be discovered. It also glosses over actual data exchange not realizing that RecvOneOrMore() is not supported on some devices.As bad as the Symbian SDK documentation is, this book does nothing to add to it.Don't waste your money."
2,"OK, does not go over 'hard topics'","This is seems much like a high school reference than a college level textbook. If you are looking for answers to challenging problems look elsewhere such as proofs on induction, well ordering, proofs by contradiction, contraposition, please look elsewhere.This book is good for going over some of the basic concepts of discrete mathematics, but does not challenge you, nor integrate many of the problems, which is what you would encounter in most college level discrete mathematics."
2,"2,000 problems by Lipschutz and Lipson","There are more than a few reviewers who miss the point: this is not a primary teaching text, it is a supplement. That said, you can learn a lot about the topic by reading this book first and solving the problems.My chief concern is NOT the place that this book fills in the curriculum, rather, it is the large number of errors in the answers. I'm half way through and this book, along that dimension, has fundamentally lost my trust. Many people complain about multiple-edition books, but that probably allows the publisher to get the bugs out. Not so for this text, which is quite old.I do NOT recommend its purchase. Buy a book without the bugs."
1,Lacks current and expanded problems:,"I recently purchased this book for a discrete math class I was attending at UMD. This was no help in practicing iteration, induction, or summation. The only good point about this book is that it gives plenty of examples for visuals (i.e. set theory, graphs, and trees)."
1,"Once again, another bad discrete math book.","Here is another example of a discrete math book that fails to explain with enough concrete examples and insight. Sure, it might be a problem solver book, but it still doesn't help a person much who has difficulty with this subject."
2,Too hard for a kid!,"I purchased this book for my five year old son, knowing I would have to help him somewhat in assembling the ships. I soon realized that this was no easy job - for a kid or an adult! My husband made one ship, and I made another, and we both were very frustrated at the difficulty level. The instructions were very brief and unclear, and pictures were not included on two of the ships - so we had a hard time deciding what they were supposed to look like! I would not recommend this book for anyone under 10 years of age, and maybe older. Granted, the color printing was nice, and one ship did turn out pretty neat. But overall, this would be best for teenagers or older Star Wars fans."
1,Poor quality cable that doesn't match the picture,"I've bought tons of ethernet cables over the years, including Belkin cables, and I know there's nothing magical about ethernet cables, especially cables that are only 1 foot long. But this cable is much thinner and cheaper feeling than other Belkin cables I have, and it does not have the molded connectors that are clearly visible in the product picture. If I wanted a cable this cheap I could have just made it myself. This would probably be my first ever return to Amazon if I thought it would be worth the time. Buyer beware though..."
5,A cable is just a cable,"It is a Cat 5e cable. No batteries, no lights, nothing fancy, just a cable. It works just fine and would be hard to mess up. Still it is appreciated that it worked just fine for the application and there were no headaches."
5,Perfect Father-Daughter Dance,"This is a great CD. My dad and I danced to ""Daughter of Mine"" at my wedding. People were in tears watching. There is no better father-daught song.Best of Luck!"
5,Love is a Voyage,"My husband fell in love with the song, ""Love is a Voyage"".After much looking I found it at Amazon.ca. We love the song, and have recommended this CD to friends. Love is a voyage and finally we found our true shipmates."
5,Jean Nate is my favorite,I cannot get this at local stores anymore. I am so glad that I can get it from you! Thanks!
2,Its Morphing Time(Triceratops),This video is about the blue ranger Billy.In the first episode there's a food festival going on at Angel Grove and Rita decides to get in the mix by creating a pig monster that can eat anything and everything.The second episode is about when Lord Zedd casts a spell on a statue that can make a clone of Billy.Now theres a good Billy and a bad Billy and the rangers must figure out a way to figure out the real Billy and the fake Billy!
4,Nantucket from the Interior,"The photography in this book is beautiful. However, if you are looking for pictures of outdoor Nantucket scenery, then you may want to choose another book. This book shows a lot of the inside of homes & their backyard gardens. It is a great background reference. It is clear the author did a lot of research of historical Nantucket when writing this book. Overall, there are a handful of really nice pictures of Nantucket, but mostly of the inside of older or newly renovated homes on the island. Great for decorating ideas!"
4,house and gardens Nantucket,"Very nice book of pictures of Nantucket. I you like to paint, the pictures in this book can give you great ideas. nice coffee table book"
5,Great book! Great author!,Great book! Great condition! Author Virginia Heard is a friend of mine and she was touched to see this book again.
1,red526,"I recognize that this book was originally a doctoral dissertation. But, even so, there is no excuse for all the jargon. One is required to plow through mounds of ""high-tone"" verbiage to get to any significant information. My high hopes for the usefulness of this book were almost totally unmet. Added to all of the above failings is the outrageous price tag of nearly $100.00."
5,perfect size glass for serving cocktail neat,"Fast shipping. Perfect size glass for serving scotch neat or your other craft cocktails chilled & strained. like the heavy bottom of the glass, feels like the glass has heft"
1,recieved the package with all glasses broken,Due to incorrect packaging all of the glasses were broken. I needed these under my tree. I will be going to sears and not buying from you again.
3,Great album,good selection of music from Rob Zombie.. some cheese on there but its one of the few places you can get some good Terry Reid tracks..
5,Well worth the listen!,"I thouroughly enjoyed this soundtrack. It has a classic rock feel with soul. It introduced me to an artist I've never heard of before, Terry Reid. I liked him so much I purchased a couple of his solo CD's. Great anytime CD to listen to. I highly recommend it's ecclectic vibe to anyone."
3,Good music lame movie,"Unless you want to hear the F word between each song, order the pg/edited version. The movie sucks but the music is good. I only ordered this for the Terry Reid cuts, they aren't available anywhere else."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this one, after what seemed like a very long wait, without a second glance. This was because the soundtrack for 1000 Corpses is one of my faves. However, I was very disapponted when I recieved it and realised that none of the material is Rob's (I know, my own stupid fault there). It's just an odd mix of dated rock and country. It was one thing to throw in an odd tune here and there on the first one(although I considered this to be a weak point), but here there is nothing to look forward to but tired AM radio fodder.So sad.... :("
4,devils rejects,"this is a good cd,it has great soundbites from the movie. the song selection stays true to the movie. i was suprised at the genre of music rob used, but i really enjoyed it. i haven't watched the dvd yet."
1,horrible... what happened?,"i don't know what happened to the author, but i've read all the books in both his series.... and when i finished this one... i didn't feel like continuing on. the book was nothing like the ones which he wrote in the past. grammatical errors, spelling errors, poor plot developments, and some characters were just dropped from the book. for those who did read it, where did tomboy go? and why would the chinese attack hawaii? for fun? there was no reason in the book why they did that. it just... happened... and because this took place at pearl, there was some history involved. excuse me, but i wasn't aware that the uss arizona was blown up by a kamikaze. kamikazes didn't even show up until iwo jima and okinawa. what happened?"
2,A joint op in name only,"When I first saw it, I thought it was going to be a crossover like Ed McBain's ""The Last Best Hope,"" but it's closer in style to any of those multi-franchise STAR TREK novel series like ""Invasion!,"" ""Day of Honor,"" ""The Captain's Table,"" and ""Badlands"" in that the story gets continued in the SEAL TEAM SEVEN novel ""Tropical Terror."" There's more focus on submarine warfare in it than aerial combat, and the ST7 contribution is basically ""Plus we've got SEAL Team Seven."" It also has the usual near-whining of all the characters (and probably Douglass) that the series seems to have picked up: ""We can't engage the Chinese over land or we'll kill civilians!"" ""Bill Clinton sold out the military!"" ""The F-18 Hornet's a piece of junk!"""
4,Die hard Keith Douglass fan,"I have been an avid reader of Keith Douglass for several years now. I especially love the books that have both the Carrier and Seal Team characters working together. This book was very good with only one exception and that would be that there wasn't a lot of action by the Seal Team. Nevertheless, it was a top quality action adventure. I have all of his Carrier and Seal Team books and it is a nice addition to my collection. Keep them coming Mr. Douglass!!"
4,A delightful read,"This book is based on a relationship between a mother and her 8 year old child that I found touching, romantic, and funny. There's a small struggle to everyday life as a mother and proves the sacrifices of motherhood. Read what happens when a man of her dreams comes along. I recommend this light-reading book to those who appreciate reading the joy of motherhood and can relate to the very small things in life."
3,"Light, fun summer reading for fans of this sort of thing","Another reviewer said it was the worst thing ever. S/he's had lucky reading experiences, because it's certainly not that bad. If you like the Nick Hornby/Helen Fielding thing, you'll probably smile at this one, though perhaps not laugh as much out loud. For that group of readers, it worth a trip to the library and will make for a nice summer read."
3,A great source of information.,"This book is full of great facts and information for decoding your Camaro's VIN and options. It even goes so far as to list prices for the listed options. I felt that the downfall of this book was the lack of production run numbers for each model. The Firebird Red Book contains this information, so I feel this book should also. Aside from this flaw, this can be a very helpful guide to the Camaro enthusiast."
3,Larger than expected,"This bag is huge. I love the style, but being a petit person, its kind of weird using this as an everyday tote. I use it as a carry-on bag, since it fits large my 17"" labtop."
5,Wonderful insights into the nature of aeronautical R&D,"This is a first rate scholarly study of the the oldest aeronautics laboratory in the United States. Its strength rests in its understanding of how scientific and engineering research really works. It's a very dynamic story with wonderful depictions of some of the most colorful research personalities in the history of American aeronautics, e.g., Eastman Jacobs, Fred Weick, Germany's own Max Munk, John Stack. Hansen's sequel to this book, entitled SPACEFLIGHT REVOLUTION, is even better."
1,Very Dissatisfied,"I order this ceramic cup and when it arrived, it was broken in pieces. Amazon does not list the returns policy for this company on the Amazon website so I was instructed to write the company directly to find out about returns. I have written them three times with no response. This is unacceptable -- the vendor or Amazon should be responsible."
4,Could have Been A 5,"Nikolai Grube provides a decent video on the downfall of the Maya. A few Cheesy dance/acting scenes that at times seemed to be just time filler but overall educational and interesting. Dos Pilas, Nachtuun, Tikal, Naranjo, etc..."
2,G Foreman grill,used this a couple of times & no more.... it does not have enough power to create the seared/broiled effect & taste. also it is too small for all the cleanup trouble..
2,Royal Pain to Clean,What a pain to clean this thing. I thought we must have a defective unit but it seems others have the problem too. If you buy one buy one with removable plates
1,Was Great Before It Broke!,"We only had this for a month before one of the hinges broke. We didn't use it everyday, just a couple times a week. Conveniently this broke a week or two after the no return policy of Amazon kicked in. Not sure if it's even worth dealing with the manufacturer with shipping costs to send it in. I'd be wary of this model and look into something that was better built."
1,poor material---poor design,This item was designed to last 1000 years; at the bottom of a dump site.The cooking surface seems to be magnitized to food. It simply will not let go. The lid has a smart 2 position design that appears to maximize designflaw in both directions. The only reason not to return it is the timethat it would take.
4,Great Grill,"Love this appliance, the latest in a long line of Foreman Grills I've owned. Especially like the large surface area and double-hinged lid for thick steaks and chops.Slightly annoying is the fact that meat often sticks to the top surface when opening, and the teflon doesn't just wipe clean...usually takes come elbow grease and a good scrubber!Still one of the easiest, cleanest, and healthiest ways to prepare food."
4,I use this product alot,"I was concerned about smoke with this product, but it doesn't smoke much when cooking. It's counter size which was important to me because I don't have alot of counter space and planned to use my grill several times a week.As long as you clean the product right after use, while it is hot, clean up is simple.Drawback: The hinged lid is difficult to use. One side will hinge, the other won't or neither side will hinge. I stuggle with it sometimes."
4,George does it again.,I really love the speed and converience of this item. I'm satisfied with this model and have no need for additional plates. Note that the price was a bit lower as I got it on a friday with about 20% reduction in price and the free shipping.It works as advertised and is a bit easier to clean than my previous model George Forman grill which it replaced. I also like the floating hinge mechanism.
3,ok,This grill gets the job done but I used to have the small dinky one and I liked it better. This one doesn't have a timer and the meat sticks to the grill if it's done or not.
3,Let George Do It!,"Cooks everything very quickly and efficiently. Just watch your food and check the doneness frequently, otherwise you might have dried our or burned yum yums for dinner! I also think it is NOT so easy to clean. I regret that I did not order the model with removable plates. Other brands also have a model where the grill plates can be washed in the top rack of your automatic dishwasher. I'm not sure George does.Still this a terrific kitchen appliance. George does it well."
4,Works fine.,"It works well enough. I wish cleanup was easier, but this the general complaint with the foreman grills."
4,works great!,This is a great grill. I just wish it were bigger. I like how you can adjust the top so that it doesn't touch the food. It's also very easy to clean. . . definite plus!
1,"Great Idea, Poor Design. Returning Mine","It does the job but as some other reviewers have written this model is hard to clean. Must be wiped clean as it stands. Also the no stick surface does stick and it is wearing off after only 3 uses. Great idea, poor design."
3,good for chicken not meat,"i saw the review for this item and had bought it as a gift for my hubby,i love the way it cooks boneless chiken slices,but the burger meat , it doesnt cook on the inside, as there is not way to control the temperature, the outside gets burnt till the patties are done, i dont know if anyone else had this same problem, but over all it cooks fast and delicoius only if the food is thin"
2,Games to Keep Kis Moving Review,"There are many great game ideas in here that allow many students to be involved, however I found that many modifications to the suggested rules needed to be made for safety. I've found that pushing and pulling between students as part of the rules of the game is not only not necessary in many sports, but can be dangerous. Unfortunately this book used this ""pushing & pulling"" strategy a bit too much. Teaching students to work as a team can be done without encouraging overly aggressive behaviors. Many of this books ideas are worthwhile, but teachers need to think ahead and modify the rules so that safety is addressed."
4,Good for beginners,"I recommend this book for beginner I Ching practitioners. The worksheets themselves are very useful and give you a handy template by which you can flesh out I Ching readings. Looking back to review previous readings is always interesting. You have an instruction for the divination, the I Ching and the journal/worksheets all in one book. I always recommend comparing I Ching translations (Wilhelm's is online for free)."
4,incandescent bulbs are kind of annoying,"I have had this light about 2 years. I have 2 other Surefires, and had one other that got stolen. I think they are great flashlights. They are all bright and feel really well made.The only problem I have had with this light, and other Surefire lights is sometimes the bulbs don't last long. Surefire says the bulbs should last about 30 hours depending on how they are used. The 225 lumen bulb on my M3 lasted through about 2 or 3 sets of batteries over the course of a year. Batteries last about 20 minutes with that bulb, so I guess I got maybe an hour of use out of it? That bulb is about $30. I was kind of annoyed about that. With one of my other Surefires, the bulb went out after being dropped. These bulbs are expensive. My next Surefire will be LED."
3,Fascinating and strange,The imaginative and thought provoking novel had me wondering where a talented writer comes up with their ideas. Caiman made me turn pages just to know what he would throw at me next.
2,Floppy MISSING!,"The book--Computerized Accounting--comes without the floppy essential for learning. I've had a terrible time using the book without it and have tried repeatedly to get the floppy containing the Quick Book data files that Horne references throughout her book.I have tried local bookstores unsuccessfully and called and written Horne asking to purchase the floppy. The She has not answered my calls or letter. I'm hoping Amazon.com can help me.Otherwise, the book contains useful material and is a good help at learning accounting basics. But, without the floppy, the book is an exercise in frustration."
2,Remediation,"Not well organized, arbitrary, puffed up, dense. If writing well is writing simply and clearly, this writing gets a D. The book is fraught with tautologies and contradictions not to mention simply not matching reality. It reminds me of the products of academic careerism at their worst."
1,Strays from the subject,"This book looks like one that would be reasonably straightforward and easy to use. Unfortunately, I found it to contain CHINESE recipes and it seemed rather unauthentic."
3,All Around the Drums could be better,This book could be better...the author forgot to give more importance to historical facts about drums. And I think you can't write something like this without ENOUGH historical knowledge about your content.
3,Rather ordinary tea,"I've been very happy with consistently high quality of Celestial brand till now. Organic Black Tea has very mild, almost non-existent flavor, despite the fact that description on the package claims it to be ""a robust, full-bodied flavor"". It appears to be expired (pardon the pun) prior to the expiration date of 06-12-2008. There is no references on the packaging to where this tea was grown, and it only has vague statement that this is an ""Artisan blend"". Fortunately, I am stuck with just 10 packs, and not 20: as I can see, Amazon now only offers 20-pack units. I would not recommend this particular tea. Better choices are English Breakfast and Irish Breakfast from Celestial Seasonings."
2,not as good as their other teas,"I like many Celestial Seasonings teas, but not this one. I will not buy this again. The flavor is stale. I will buy other types but not black tea - not again."
3,Not Bad,"I have been ordering this tea for some time. I like black tea and this is the best organic black tea I have found. It could have more flavor, but it's not bad."
5,Scooby Doo: Showdown in Ghost Town,"This game is a good fun learning game for kids, especially if you like Scooby Doo. It has you go around to different places and find clues to help solve a mystery, just like in the shows."
2,Fun first time only,"Our 3 children love computer games, (ages 6,7,&8) but this one they only wanted to play once. The game is too repetetive, and not very challenging."
2,A Little Slow,"My nine year old was able to make his way through the mysteries but getting from one place to another is a little slow and the game also there tends to be too much of the same thing each time you play. When the newness of the game wore off, my son did not choose this game to play very often."
4,This is a lot of fun!!,"Look, it may not be the best PC game, but over all this is a lot of fun!My niece (age 2 1/2) and I play together and we have a great time. The screen images are very crisp and clear. There are all sorts of clues that you need to find and the more we play, the more clues my niece remembers. She gets a big huge grin on her face when she remembers what we need to do next!She's really into trains right now and there is a very cool train ride where Scooby and Shaggy are being chased by ""the bad guy"".The sounds are fun and come on, IT'S SCOOBY! Oh, and the best part is, the only time you see Scrappy is when you go to the menu screen. :)"
3,Disappointing,"My five year old (big Scooby-Doo fan) worked his way through the game very quickly. The package states that it's different each time the game is played. However, the variations in each new game tended to be minimal, with a finite number of suspects and the clues are always in the same place, regardless of what level is played. So once you've played the game once, and know where the clues are, there's no mystery the next time you play. Only the villain's identity changes between one of the five suspects."
4,"Dirty District, Vol 3","As all the Dirty District volumes always promises, a variety of underground and signed artists, as well as a fine mix of old school artists like Al Hudson (One Way), on fresh brand new tracks. What sets this Vol 3 apart from the previous 2 volumes to me is the clever infusion of R&B strategically placed to break the rap music up in sections. It gives the feeling of what mix tapes USED to sound like back in the early to mid 90's, a must have for the J-Dilla inspired fans out there, you wont be disapointed."
3,An OK Read,"I read the book in two sittings. Easy read. Not the most profound book I have ever read but I think I would have enjoyed it much better if it did not have the ""cajun"" talk and the ""baby"" talk. It was just plain silly. I know children cannot pronounce many words but give me a break. And when the adults talked like the baby, especially the mother, that just killed me. I don't think it's a memorable book. But I enjoyed it none the less. I would recommend it ""IF"" there was nothing else around to read."
3,Get rid of the baby talk and you have a good book,"This is the story of a woman on the run with her 3 year old daughter. Emma is the focus of a man obsessed. She flees to a small town and quickly becomes involved in town. She falls for the tall dark and handsome sheriff named Elvis. Who cares that he's missing an arm and has a scar on his face. She sees past that. Together they try to bring Emma's life back. Ok, good storyline even a good story. But..... through out the whole book Emma's daughter Gracie is talking baby talk. Get gets so annoying that you want to gag. She also gave too much maturity to the 3 year old. (newly turned 3 year old) What 3 year old has the ability to reason like an adult and carry on conversations like an adult except for the baby translations. Way to much for this reader."
4,Loved Elvis,"I've always been a sucker for a man named Elvis, and this one was no exception. An imperfect man, but a perfect hero. And I really liked how things sizzled when Elvis and Emma got together. Little Gracie was delightful! She knew Elvis was a keeper from the very first."
3,Not Susan Anderson Best Effort,I also had trouble with the dialog. There was too much of Gracie's talking & not being around kids myself it was hard to figure out all the time what she was saying. Emma's Cajun accent was also difficult at times. I didn't always know what she was saying either. Elvis had it right when he told her English please!! I also didn't like the repeat dialog between Elvis & Emma. If you can get by all the language problems & just enjoy the story it is a good story. I enjoyed the story but it took too much of an effort at times to figure out what they were saying. That's why I gave it a 3.
4,I agree with Kelly,"A good book, but the child's incessant baby talk (""I yike twikes"") drove me crazy."
3,"The book is fine, shame about the editing","This isn't a review about the book, it's more a warning about those who hate poor editing. I can't understand why some kindle books are so poorly edited and this is one of the worst. There are some spelling mistakes in the original book to show how the toddler, Gracie speaks, but there are so many other errors. Towards the end of the book there is even an error message in the book (the kind of thing you get when you cross reference but have lost the link to it). There are apostrophes in weird places, quotation marks the wrong way round and simple typing errors (an m instead of an n). I bought this kindle edition to replace my old paperback, but obviously I will be keeping the paperback - which has actually been proof-read."
3,Exposure,The story in this book was good and I enjoyed it but the editing was HORRIBLE. It was extremely distracting with all of the typos. I think it should be re-edited and released again. If I were the author I would be very upset.
4,surprised to enjoy this one so much,Not normally enjoying the romance/suspense combination I was a little hesitant to buy this one BUT Susan Andersen has written a thoroughly enjoyable story. Loved the two main characters - especially the mature way they communicated and dealt with their problems. The description of the good and bad things about small-town life were also realistic. If you have enjoyed her other books do buy this one - if you haven't yet discovered her talent - what are you waiting for?
4,Enjoyable Read,"I liked this book. Emma is a memorable character, and all major characters in this book are 3-dimensional. My only problem is with the forced dialects of Emma and Grace(I had a similar problem with Be My Baby). I don't know many Cajun Southerners, but I don't care for the generic terms of affection- cher, chere, cherie etc.,. And trying to read any intelligence out of Grace's baby ""tawk"" is nearly impossible. I know small children have trouble with certain consonents, but can't that be more subtly inferred with simple, monosyllabic phrases? If not for the language factor, this book is top rate. It is fast paced, witty, and the characters relate to each other in a realistic way. Worth a purchase!"
3,"Nope, not her best...","I agreed that although I generally like this author, this was not her best book. I also agree that Gracie was too central to the story line and that her vocabulary and conversations were not realistic to a 3-year-old. What I also found annoying was the way Emma interspersed her ""Cajun"" French in her conversations. Although I'm not an expert, I found it unrealistic that she spoke this way. But, on the whole, I did enjoy the book. The story line was, for the most part, pretty engaging."
2,Not her best effort,"This book was disappointing. The hero's name, Elvis Aaron, was a bit trite. The plot had potential, yet I found the dialogue between the main characters sadly lacking. I found it to be a difficult book to finish."
3,Enjoyed the story,"Good plot, interesting characters. I enjoyed the relationship between Emma and her daughter Gracie. Overall, a good story that will entertain you on a beach or rainy day."
2,Very little to nothing about quilting.,"If you want to watch a Chicago club of middle aged women giggling and dancing and another sewing buttons and candy wrappers on cloth, well this is the DVD for you. The view of Gallery Quilts flies by so fast it's little more than a blur. In its favor, there is actual sewing being done by A MAN on a quilt that is quite a work of art. But this is momentary. Unfortunately this quilt is demoted to a status of 'also ran' in favor of the junk drawer lady and the giggling chorus. If you want to see a DVD about quilting and the beautiful quilts that hang in museums keep on shopping."
4,same release,"i bought this title thinking it would be a new release,but sadly dissappointed that it features all the same tracks on his release ""in and out with..."".also the listing said the cd was called ""chill out"" but it was actually called ""a night in with boy george"".so buyers beware that you don't double up on the same stuff."
4,"A good story about winning, losing and cheating","I bought this just as my 6 year old son was getting into watching football on tv and pretending he was a football player. Harry the dog can talk to Mike the young boy via telepathy and ends up giving him the plays he overhears the other side planning to help the team win the first game. In the second game, Mike has to decide if he will use Harry's telepathic powers or go without. It's an enjoyable read aloud book with a lesson about how it's not really winning when someone cheats."
1,Do yourself a favor and get a different collar,"When I first got the collar it looked great and I was happy. Then I tried to open it. It was EXTREMELY tight and very difficult to open. It was actually painful to my hands to get the thing open.I opened and closed it a few times, and thought it was looser. I put it on my dog 3 times and struggled to get it off of him each time. The last time I just had to cut it off.Get a different collar, this one is bad."
5,BEST MYSTERY OF TODAY,KILLER IN PAIR-A-DICE SETTING WAS WELL PICKED AND TITLED. THE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH NEW YORK POLICE CAME TO THE FOREFRONT IN THIS BOOK. VERY HARD TO LAY IT DOWN ONCE YOU START TO READ.CORWIN MCINTYRE AUTHOR OF FOR AMERICA OUR LAST HURRAH
5,Amazing,"Paul, Linus and Marco absolutely shred in this DVD! The songs are performed live but not in front of a live audience, it's live in a studio situation. The guys really seem to enjoy the music they are creating which adds to the enjoyment of watching and the introductions to the songs by Paul (insane shredding included) makes it even more fun to watch."
2,A live DVD without an audience. Just plain strange.,"As you'd expect with a Paul Gilbert ""Live"" DVD, the band is tight and the playing is excellent. When I see the word ""Live"" in a music title, I think ""in concert"". Surprise, it's live in a studio, no audience! It comes across more as like an instructional video than a live video. Each song has an intro by Gilbert, demonstrating a riff from the song and telling what key it's in before actually playing it. They play the whole thing in the space outfits they wear on the cover of ""Spacehip One"". To say I was disappointed is an understatement, it bores to tears. I hate to say anything negative about Paul, but avoid this one, get one of his earlier live dvd's or the ""Spaceship One"" cd."
3,Safe Arrived Dented,"I might be generous by giving this product 3 stars. The safe had two dents (one in the upper corner and one on the upper right side edge of the safe). I did read on the safe that the safe had been drop-tested and fire-tested. The dents were disappointing for a $200+ item, but since the damage didn't appear too severe, I kept the product. The safe was the exact size that I wanted and the instructions were easy and clear how to program the safe, a plus. Unfortunately, only after receiving the safe, did I read the comments of other reviewers of other models of Honeywell safes, most complained of dents or worse damage to their safes."
5,Bound By Honor,"This is a wonderfully written book by a new author. Keeps you glued to the pages and leaves you wanting more. Just the right amount of love, intrigue, mystery and excitement. I will be looking for another book by this author."
1,scooby doo and the phantom of the knight disappoints,"As a person with considerable experience at the computer, I was diasppointed in this game. After several hours, I had produced only one suspect and one clue. The directions for operating thetoolbar to acquire clues or evidence did not work for me. I havemastered other games of considerable difficulty, so I was relieved to see that other reviewers had similar problems to myown with this game. Pass on this one and try something else!"
1,Not for Little Ones,"I bought this for my 5 year old and were BOTH stuck! He has played it several times and can't get past the first clue. He became frustrated with this game and stopped playing it. I too thought maybe it was me, but I am apparently not the only one out there who wasted their money on this game. I can only hope the other games for Scooby fans are better, as my son now wants a new one since ""this one won't work""."
1,An exercise in frustration,"If I could give this game 0 stars, I would. The box says ""kids can play independently. Provides help when your child needs it."" This is completely untrue. Like another parent here, I tried to play it myself after my child went to bed, but still was stuck. The help section just tells you what to do with characters, mazes, and games that you can't get to. It was no help whatsoever. I hope this review saves someone a purchase. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this! I will be returning this one to Amazon!"
1,Waste of money,"This game was soooo frustrating that I could not even help my daughter with this one. I kept going back to the Help menu, thinking that we've missed something too but it just did not help us at all. My daughter was so disappointed, we had to take the game back. I couldn't figure out a darn thing. My daughter is 5 and she can play most of my computer games with no problem but this one baffled us both. Do yourself a favor and save your money for a Scooby board game or something else -- don't make the same mistake I did!!"
1,I've played adult games that were easier,"I bought this game because my son is a Scooby freak. He played it and couldn't get beyond 1 suspect and one clue. So I played it after he went to bed and I couldn't either. I thought I must be missing something. I went in every room, I clicked on everything. Help was worthless. I thought I must be missing something simple but I guess others have this same problem. Wish I read these reviews before I bought it."
1,Disappointing Waste of Money,"Bought this program for my 7 year old son. (The product says ages 5-10). What a piece of [...] this is! I have had other programs from the Learning Company that perform rather well. While installing this program you are forced to install lots of other junk ""tag-a-long"" programs (AOL, Quick time etc.)just to complete the install. Finally getting the program to run I, the 36 year old adult could not figure out how to make any progress in the game at all. How can I expect my son to figure it out? It was Impossible to even get to the games in which you earn ""Scooby Snacks"" that are needed to get around in the Castle. Printed out the entire ""Book"" of instructions and still could not get anywhere. I wish I would have read the other reviews first, I would not have bought it. My son doesn't even want to try it anymore since it's so frustrating."
3,Parents Cheapsheet for this potential Frustrating game.,"It took me an hour to realize that to get past the first suspect and clue, you needed to give the ""feather duster"" to the old lady. That opens the locked door and makes the most of the other suspects appear. For the other locked door in the town, listen carefully to the Jester's rhyme after you give him the first ball.With these two hints, the game is just like the ""Jinx at the Sphinx"". Without them, you will want to throttle the programmers. I played the game myself before I let my 5 yr old play. Since I knew the tricks, he enjoyed it completely.Good Luck."
2,hard but no replayability,"I brought this for my daughter and played it myself first. I enjoyed the difficulty that the game play provided but was extremely dissappointed to find that the second time I played was exactly the same, all the items in the same place, the game play the same, it was easy. The only thing that really changes is the villan and the clues.The kids have played once, with helpful hints from me to get them going when they got stuck. They havent been back which dosent surprise me as they tend not to replay games that do not have some varability.It could have been a great game as it has the difficulty but without varibility it is not as good as it could be.Solving the villian and clues does not play a big enough part in the game to make it replayable."
3,Fun! My son loves this game.,"My five-year old really enjoys this game. I really enjoyed playing it with him the first time. While I find that playing it more than once is dull, my son can play it again and again (by himself!).The game requires that he listen to what is said, remember clues and locations, and to conduct a thorough search. While I wouldn't call this game educational, I still find it to have some positive merits. Additionally, as a gamer myself I think that this is an appropriate adventuring game for a 5-8 year old and builds some of the skills needed for more complex adventuring games.We had no trouble what-so-ever installing the product. We popped in the disk, clicked install, and everything worked great. My five-year old could have installed this!"
3,Disappointed...,"I was excited to see that I got my desk in the mail. Just so you know, the desk comes in two separate packages... When I opened one of the boxes I saw some pieces were loose. I ended up having to wood-glue parts of my desk together, which unfortunately was barely held together. Other reviews show that this is a common problem. I would have ordered another desk if I had known the desk would need to be fixed.Relatively easy to assemble, still looks nice, so I gave it 3 stars."
1,Very skeptical of the good reviews,"Awful packaging. Unbelievably poor quality. Box looked good from outside, inside desk was broke in 7 places. One of the desk legs was the wrong leg. Staples used to hold pieces together barely reached 2nd piece, would literally fall apart in your hands. Paint cracked and flaking back at every stapled joint. I was expecting ""inexpensive"", I wasn't expecting the poorest quality product I have ever seen. Holy cow this is sooooo bad!"
4,Like the desk a lot,"We liked the desk a lot... it's a good size and easy to assemble. We chose the color ""Merlot"" which is nice but much more RED than we thought. I thought the color Merlot would be more of a darker color wood, not so red."
2,Damaged and issues,"Well, I'm not happy. I spend weeks trying to find the perfect desk and decided on this one. The boxes arrived in good shape, but the top corer was damaged. Looks like it was dropped - possibly before it was packaged. The bottom predrilled holes on all four legs were 1/4"" off. I currently have them only attached with one of the two screws. White spot on the front of the desk. Just not happy. Sent a message to the company to see what can be done."
4,Not as sticky as other brands,"Has a nice flavor, not one that has a bad after taste or is too thick to enjoy. The warming is very subtle, but effective. Man and I enjoyed using it."
2,too thick,"In my opinion I think its too thick. smells great its just more thick than I expected. I reccommend ""wet"" brand, its water based and tastes awesome. ---> stayswetlonger.com"
5,The Scent of God,"The title caught my attention with the unusual sensory image. I appreciate memior and autobiography, and, this life story is intense. Beryl Singleton Bissell searches and describes spirtual and sensual knowing of self and the world through her unique life story. The sentences are well written. There is a sense of wonder throughout. I eagerly will give this book as a gift to others."
5,"Poetry, if you've never like poetry","This work is real for me in elegance, simplicity and joy. Mauro puts together words like no other writer I have ever read...in fact I've never liked poety that much, but Claudia Mauro makes reading it so accessable and fun. The words partner and dance with each other. There is also a thought or perspective that gets some really good air time as well.This is poetry for the poets--the wordmasters to see another wordmaster at work, but mostly it is for the ordinary reader that enjoys reading but has never really appreciated the art of crafting a poem.There is an absolute richness of words playing together that Mauro hands to the reader with a smiple gesture of spirit.I recommend this with all my heart."
3,Some Very Nice Ideas,"Contains some great ideas and super pictures of finished products, but gives much less information on how to construct the mid to large arbor projects that I was looking to do. It also is more of an intermediate to expert carpenter project book; I suspect most high intermediate and expert builders could easily take any of the ideas here and run with them. I, being somewhat of a novice carpenter, was looking for something a little more ""by the numbers"" for the arbors I would like to build. However, I am using the step by step trellis plans for one of the simpler trellises and it's very much ""by the numbers""."
2,Protects but not made good enough,"These are meant to protect the clip on the RJ45 (ethernet) cable connector, these do that, but they fail at the part that makes it functional. The reason why is how small and shallow the clip cover is, when it fits snug on the connector it pushes the clip a little down, this means it now fails to let the clip latch on the ethernet port and stay secured. I wouldn't buy these again."
5,"""No Snag Boots for RJ 45 Connectors""","These little boots for RJ 45 Connectors are such a time saver. Not so much for the original install, but for any type of reconfigure of a data center or hub room. Those who choose to install without these boots are either ignorant or inconsiderate of the next person who will make changes behind them. These are a must for data work"
4,RJ45 Blue Strain Relief Boots (50 Pcs Per Bag),"Worke as expected. Am able to use parallel ports without any issues. I will say the material should be a little more flexible as it seems more plastic than silicon soft. Otherwise they work great and for the count vs costs, it can't be beat."
1,Don't bother,I got these figuring they would make my ethernet cables I made look more professional and protect the connectors. They actually don't stay on the connectors and float down the wire from the connector. If you manage to get one to stay on the connector it will squeeze it's tab and make it fall out of the device it's plugged into. Absolutely worthless.
5,Just what you expect,"Pretty simple. Slip over the cable, crimp the ends, and then slide this over the connector. This was my first time ever making my own ethernet cable ends, and it was easy."
2,"maybe its me, but I don't like these","Perhaps I was expecting to much, but this is not really doing much for my cables. They mostly get in the way and are a bit to loose for my taste. It may bee unfair, since they are a bit loose on the wire, because maybe the wire I bought is a bit slim - I don't know. But next time I will try another brand."
4,Great Buy,Im satisfied with this item purchase. Great savings and they do the job. I wil definitely buy some more of these boots.
3,"Nice, solid, tough","A nice blue color, it is a bit of a darker shade of blue than the picture. It still matches the 1000ft of cable I have. It's a strain relief boot, what can you really say about it? Does the job. These things are pretty solid, more than stuff I got a Lowe's."
4,Most durable of the collector's editions,"Like all of the bigger collector edition models are of their respective ships, this is a very good representation of the snow speeder. It didn't take all that long to put together, either. It now sits very stably on the top of my desk, next to where the Star Destroyer USED to sit before being knocked off by a closing door one too many times. (It didn't get hit; the vibrations in the floor were enough.)The durability of this model stands in stark contrast to all of the other models, except for maybe the Naboo Fighter. This thing is built like a brick, which I suppose is understandable given its size and shape. It doesn't have thin, folding wings like the X-wing, and it is far less volumnous than the Star Destroyer. This wasn't near the top of my list, but since I already had all the others, it was a welcome addition."
2,does not contain much..,"this rough guide isn pretty much the same as the other guides.. as usual in singapore it contains the usual places.. orchard, little india, sentosa, east coast and the usual touristy places. It does not include the heartlanders area eg. Hougang, Yishun etc. For eg, in woodlands.. it only mention the the zoo.. did you know that's a big Shopping Mall in Woodlands called the Causeway point.. nect to the MRT station.. As for eating places.. it fail to capture the good places for local food.. may interest the food lovers and those adventourous enough to try..It should include a portion on the heartlanders.. I'm sure some tourist may want to see our locals their way of life.. for eg a tour of an HDB estate (public housing) that may include the market, the coffeeshop, look at the flat inside out.. etc.. the peculiar and distinct characters of the heartlanders.. etc.. otherwise tourists may think S'pore is just of the ""place"""
4,"They Work Great, but BOTH times I've ordered the tablets have been broken.","The ingredients here are very good. The boost for my weightlifting workouts is great. If you're considering a pre-workout boost, you already know what you're doing here.I have ordered twice from Amazon. Both times the pills have been broken and pulverized. I don't know if other vendors might do better--it might just be the nature of the ingredients--but my orders were from different lots with the same dusty results."
1,defective,"it was defective, it's the last time I order used CD.i have nothing more to say. there shoud'nt be a mnium f wr thisriew."
2,Not for the long term,"This is an interesting interpretation of the Tango. Its modern and it's sort of funky. However after listening to this a number of times, I find it's a bit shallow. It doesn't have the rise and fall of other tango music. It's a sort of ""one speed Tango"", and that's just not enough to maintain my interest over many listenings."
4,"Great poem-novel, pedestrian translation","Marta Tikkanen's poem-novel (diktroman) is one of the classics of recent Swedish language writing. This bittersweet account of her marriage to the alcoholic and egomaniac Henrik Tikkanen, (himself a prominent finlandsswedish writer) is told in a series of separate but linked poems. As in her other works from the 70s, Marta Tikkanen tempers her feminism and criticism with an ironic humor.My only reservation is the quality of the translations by Stina Katchadourian. While Katchadourian is a native Finland-Swede, her translations in this volume seem to me to be overly literal, translating the words while missing the the alliteration and rhythm.As a bonus, Henrik Tikkanen was also a talented illustrator, and contributed to the second edition (rather decent of him, given the scathing portrait)."
3,little smaller than it looks,"This is a great pirate hat, but it was a little smaller than we thought it would be. It's pretty durable and made of quality stuff."
5,Even handed & solid coverage of 4th century debates,"I found this book to provide the best recounting of facts from the original source texts (more fair than Grillmeier's set.) His tone is not an apologetic of classical trinitarian dogma, but neither is he negatively skeptical of the what became ""orthodoxy"". The coverage is suggestive of the fluid state of doctrine at that time. Agreement, unfortunately was settled politically. The material focuses on the 4th century debates, but not the later extentions made at Chalcedon."
4,Painstakingly detailed!!!,"I worked through this text in a doctoral seminar on the Arian Crisis. It is without doubt a must read to grasp the intricacies involved in the early patristic struggle of identifying the triune God. Hanson was too harsh on Athanasius, in my opinion. However, the book is an essential guide and will be consulted again and again. Solid scholarship if sometimes a little lop-sided!"
3,Christian Rap?,"This CD was alright, but it's Christian Rap and I'm just not into that whole thing. Try the real thing like A Tribe Called Quest or any Dan the Automator productions (Handsome Boy Modeling School, Gorillaz)."
3,Only 30 mins+ of Winwood,"WARNING: There's only about 30 mins+ with Steve Winwood. If you're like most people, you are more interested in Winwood, the roots of Traffic and then solo Winwood, but there's only the aforementioned time in which Winwood appears. The rest is of the less interesting SDG after Winwood. In all fairness though, the DVD is named after Davis. Oh well..."
3,Was the truth not provocative enough?,"This isn't a bad film, if you view it as fiction. Why so many interesting aspects of the artist's life were misrepresented, or plainly fabricated, is beyond me.It's always irritating to me when fiction is passed off as biographical. If you use the man's name, use the man's life. If it's a life worth documenting, then it's a life worth documenting accurately.I'm all for a measure of creative license. Certainly, some is necessary in a feature film format. This one went beyond. Even the art was fabricated. Not just reproductions of existing paintings, but paintings that don't exist (i.e. Picasso never painted a portrait of Modigliani).There are a number of biographies and a documentary about Modigliani if you're interested in his real-not-hollywoodized life, and work. Heck, read wikipedia. You'll learn more about the man."
2,Contains Preservatives,"While this aloe has several things going for it,such as organic aloe vera and 100% natural fruit juice (which provides good flavor), it contains preservatives. While for some customers this may not be a negative, for those like myself who cannot have artificial preservatives such as Sodium Benzoate and Potassium Sorbate, this juice is not the right product. These ingredients were not disclosed in the Amazon listing which is disappointing."
2,Just not sure.,"I ""may"" have left another review about this juice but can't remember. At first, I really thought it was great. But, after a month or so of taking it, I can't stay out of the bathroom!!!! It may be helping in other ways but it just isn't worth me having this problem. I have also been sick to my stomach for about a week. Hum!!! I'm going back to my Lily of the Desert 100% pure aloe juice that is much cheaper and didn't cause this problem."
3,Reduced picture quality,"This little camera has nice features such as it's size, weight, and weatherproofing. Picture clarity is another issue. Photos are no where near 35 mm quality. They tend to look soft and kind of fuzzy. Not sure if the focus is off or the film resolution is that much less or I am just too picky. If you are looking for a easy to carry and use camera and are not too concerned about picture qualiity, this camera will serve you well. I will be getting rid of mine."
1,I hate this thing!!,"Ugh! I hate this camera! I thought it would be cool cause of the advantix film options and the size of the camera itself, but it was nothing but a waste of money.the delay between shots on this camera is RIDICULOUS! I am serious! So many times I have missed that ""kodak moment"" because of that!also, it takes a VERY long time to start up.It also has a lot of trouble focusing. a lot of times I can't get my shot because it won't focus because of an angle or a matter of inches. it is SOOOOOOO annoying!the pictures aren't that bad, but they certaintly are not great.we also recently had trouble with when the film runs out the camera would get stuck rewinding and would freak out. it also got stuck a few times trying to retract its' lens. we had to send it to kodak for repairs.don't buy it!! save the [money] and put it towards a better camera!"
2,Mediocre,"I really liked this camera the first year I had it. The pictures were good, it was very convenient... but a few days after the one year warranty had expired, the camera started to rewind the film after just one or two pictures and sometimes freeze up (the lens wouldn't retract). It is currently at a repair shop. Another downside is the high cost of APS film and development."
5,"These guys cant fail, can they?","Seriously people, these guys cant help but get better in various ways in this album, yet remain in the past in a few others. While most agree that their heavier stuff in the past were their highlights, I find their bombastic turnaround to be a good, predictable one, and this comes from a person who doesnt like dream theater. Hansis voice just keeps getting more powerfull with each album, and its natural for the music to keep changing in that broad, sonorous direction. The only weak song in this album would be 5, too slow, so its good to see most keep a good pace. And while they stay in the past by keeping the bombastic direction of their previous album, you never know what curball these guys might throw in the future. Furthermore, its cool to see them sing in spanish, since, Colombian born myself, its interesting to see them sing in my native language, and I hope for more of that in the future. Also, they rule live, so check em out wherever possible! Worth the travel."
5,oh my god!,"i recently received this album in the mail from amazon and its rendered me speechless. i havent been able to stop listening to ""A Night At The Opera"" for several days and counting! blind Guardian definetely didnt waste their time in the studio when they were making this, theres so much going on here that it can be overwhelming at first, but if you let it sink in, youll see how epic this album really is. ""Precious Jerusalem"" gets everything going with fast drumming, quick riffs, and a powerful chorus done with a choir. since then, the journey doesnt slow down until the bonus track, ""Mies, Del Dolor"", which features Hansi singing in a foreign language(Spanish?). however, as breathtaking and powerful this is, i dont think they quite got up to the majesty of their earlier release, ""Nightfall in Middle Earth"". that album just cant be beat, and trying to reach those heights once more is going to need more work, but this album is an awesome effort and worth your time."
4,Spend a night at the opera with: Blind Guardian!,This album is awesome. It's blistering! To hear all the details you'll want to hear it over and over. And may be that's the only problem with this disc. Some songs have too much stuff. Cool anyway!
3,Not as good as spected,"The correct rating in my opinion should be 3,5 stars but since thats not posible I rate it with 3. Is not that this is a bad album, but coming from Blind this is no one of their best, considering also the great success of Nightfall in the Middle Earth or Imaginations from the other side. This may be the reason why I was disapointed with it, even do it isn't bad. There are some interestings tracks that need to be pointed: ""Precious Jerusalem"", for example, a song with a lot of power and energy and very nice choruses, ""Under the Ice"", ""sadly Sings Destiny"" very on the way of previous albums, ""the Soulforged"" also a very good work more alike with previous albums, maybe my favorite and finally ""And there was silence"" an interesting song of 14:05 minutes but very well structurated.Another thing that made me rate this album with 3,5 was the fact that the art work is so poor that it is very disapointing for B.G. fans."
3,"Boring, Grandiose","I love Blind Guardian, but...here's the scoop:this CD follows in the same direction as Nightfall in Middle Earth--keyboard-saturated, symphonic tracks. It is very little like the earlier Blind Guardian I love, namely Somewhere far Beyon, Tales from the Twilight World."
3,not as good as middle-earth,"At the end of the day this does not sound as epic as middle- earth the songs don,t seem to stand out and the melodies arent quite as good"
2,"Blind Guardian, How could you do this to me?","First of all, This is NOT Blind Guardian. Most people get the impression from ""nightfall...."" that Blind Guardian is a big, bombastic band. Very untrue for any fan who has heard earlier material (""follow the blind"", ""battalions of fear"", ""tales from the twilight world""). What we have always cared about was the uniqueness of Hansi's voice and the insane soloing (which really isn't that difficult). BG has always been a ""fun"" band with some really emotional stuff. Well now that is gone, the bombastic choruses on thsi album destroy any uniqueness in Hansi's voice. The solos are what we've heard on every other Blind Guardian album and the lyrics are strangely silly....Nothing memorable on this album, this album only gets two stars because of ""precious jerusalem"". This was the only tune worth listening to..."
1,a night at the opera,"Let me start this review with the following qualifier.I am not a rabid fan of this band. I have thought the threeprevious albulms to be excellent, but I don't give thisrelease the same amount of praise. There is way to much orchestration and 'noise' going on for my taste.The musicianship is as good as you could possibly ask for,but I don't think the songwriting keeps up.Yes it is a departure in some ways for them, but not a stepforward I am dissapointed to say.Not in the same category as Nightfall on Middle earth."
2,A spoof on heavy metal?,"I purchased this CD based on some amazing reviews I have read for this record. The first thing that came to my mind upon listening to this was Spinal Tap. Is this some sort of heavy metal spoof or joke? I will admit that the musicianship on this record is quite astonishing and there is no doubt that there is talent in this band, but this just sounds like fire and brimstone power metal. I have been a fan of Iron Maiden for years, and this band is no Iron Maiden. Iron Maiden has an addictive quality to their music, which is sorely lacking in Blind Guardian. The only addictive trait to Blind Guardian is what I perceive as the band's sense of humor.I enjoyed some of the riffs on this record and if this was simply an instrumental record I would have given it 4 stars. As it stands however, the lyrics, lead vocals and choir backup leads me to believe that this band is hamming it up."
2,"Too ""catchy"".","I give this album two stars because the band members are so talented. My overall opinion of this album is not very high. I have never heard anything else by Blind Guardian; I listen mostly to heavier stuff. The musicians do have a lot of talent which draws me from giving this one star but a lot of the songs are just too ""catchy"" for my tastes. For example, I never owned any Iron Maiden albums but Bruce Dickinson has a great voice. I like to hear vocals done in an aggressive way. Hansi isn't that bad a singer but this is much lighter than what I normally go for. Just listen to something like ""Precious Jerusulam"" to see what I'm talking about. ""The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight"" is perhaps a little more interesting but still I prefer my music heavier. Click on my username to see what I am into if you want."
4,a great power metal album,"this is the first blind guardian album i have bought. before this all i knew was the cover of ""beyond the realms of death"" which was originally a judas preist song. well i am glad i got it. it is a powerful vocal album. there has to be like 6 different vocal tracks atleast. that can be nice but it can be annoying. the last track would be nice if it had a english translation to it. the first track precious jeruselem is a quality song that uses vocal layers with good taste. with a name like ""a night at the opera"" some of the vocals do sound like theatrical songs. with that said i would highly reccomend this album if you like the power metal genre and the high pitched vocals with many vocal layers. i look forward to getting other albums by them."
2,THis singer....,"First of all, I think it's absurd for a band to release an album featuring a title identical to Queen's absolute masterpiece, A NIGHT AT THE OPERA.Second, even liking Blind Guardian a lot, I had enough of Hansi Kursch harsh adn full of acent vocals. It's simply unbearable for me nowadays."
1,"Oh, the pain!!","I have to agree with a previous reviewer from Aug. 5,2002, Rand Al-Thor. I could have written that myself with only two exceptions;1) I didn't hear the bonus track that actually had real singing as I couldn't get past the fifth track without cringing in near agony over the auful and overbearing vocals (kind of like those senes from Star Trek where everyone on the bridge is covering there ears and falling to the floor - they must have had this disc on).2)I have never heard anything from Blind Guardian before this one, so I have no frame of reference to any past work. Doubtful I ever will after this mess.I do so agree with him also about the drunken, disorderly croud noise. That is the first thing I thought when I first played this CD. I've learnes my lesson about buying a CD based on the good reviews. From now on I will listen first!! This one will end up at the local used CD store."
3,Different and innovating... but it gives me a headache!,"I love thrash and power metal. A Night at the Opera (why did they choose such an un-original title?) falls within a different music category. It's somewhat unique, which is the reason I give it 3 stars. It's fast, aggressive, sometimes melodic and well played throughout. The singer's voice is very particular, and the album is filled with many sounds different from the conventional power metal category.HOWEVER, I think Blind Guardian tried so hard to make a different album that it came out totally over played and very noisy. After the third song the screaming vocals start getting pretty annoying. There is so much going on at the same time that it doesn't let the music breath properly. It ends up being a very overwhelmingly noisy album threading in the edge of cacophony. I will continue giving A Night At The Opera a chance, but I cannot make it after the fourth song without changing the CD and reaching for an aspirin."
3,Good but missing the mark,"Typical from them.Better than some where far beyond,but nothing to Nightfall in Middle Earth."
5,KICK ASS,"It's worth it just for ""The Soulforged!"" Come on, people. They wrote a killer song about THE coolest fantasy character ever imagined--The one and only Raistlin Majere! If for no other reason, buy this CD!"
3,"less would have been much, much, more...","This album is a massive, overproduced wall of great music. However, that strength also happens to be the albums worst flaw. Here's the only way i can describe it. I happen to love iced coffee (let me finish). This album is the equivalent of a tsunami of iced coffee surging directly at me. While its quite delicious, I'm gonna take a few sips and get the hell outta there while i still can. This album is a relentless barrage of loud, good music. While every song is good, I can only manage to listen to three or so consecutively before i start to get ""drowned"" out.... sorry, that was bad."
2,Not Lithium Ion batteries,These are not Lithium Ion batteries. They are Lithium primary batteries. Quite a difference as these really should not be recharged in a Li-Ion recharger. I should have read more into the product description where they are described just as Lithium batteries.
4,Pretty Great,"Overall, very good. Pages and pages of airplane interiors and brand identity design, but I was hoping for more airport interior design. I didn't see one shot of the famous Eames group airport seating...? WTF?"
5,Thrilled,"I am thrilled with my little book. I try to incorporate these numerous foods into my diet. There are a lot of foods in here. There are vegetables, fruits, nuts, herbs, fish, meat and more."
4,Good reference book,"This is a great primer to start with when looking for healthy foods to prepare. It's very to the point. It's also inexpensive. The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't rank the foods. But maybe that's asking too much since they're all very good for you, anyway."
2,Nope.,"Can't tell you how many times I played this album trying to catch a hint of something in it. But no, it just isn't there. Paul Simon's music, just about all of it, has brought great joy and beauty to my life, but here he just falls flat."
1,It grows on you--like a fungus.,"No, seriously. You may like this or you may not, but I can't understand the people urging you to listen to it ten times or more. It's a guy who proved incontravertably in ""One Trick Pony"" (the movie) that he can't convincingly declaim a line TALKING. Trust me: even if you love it at first (or second, third, or fourth), you don't want to hear it ten times!"
4,The Old Man Sings and Heals,"1.This album requires audience particiapation- you cannot listen to it without thinking. 2. Although I'm not in love with all the songs, Paul Simon as a perfomer excels on this album. In particluar, his rendetion of ""Pigs, Sheeps and Wolves"" combines great comic timing with Simon's clear and calm tenor. 3. ""Love"" is a magnificent song that makes me feel better about not feeling better. 4. ""Quiet"" proposes a refreshing and brilliant way to approach failure: ""When they say you're not good enough/Well the answer is you're not"" If only all the angry and arrogant people in this world understood that."
1,Save your money,"I'm out about 15 bucks, so maybe I can save someone the same fate. As long-time fans of Paul Simon, my wife and I bought this CD with high expectations. We've listened to it several times, once in the car during a painfully long stretch of highway where we were determined to find a reason to like it, but unfortunately, it just ain't there. The melodies don't seem go with the choruses which don't go with the rhythms which don't go with the lyrics which all makes for an ugly music stew in our heads. Now, maybe we're very musically unsophisticated, but we know good stuff/bad stuff. Despite other reviewers' suggestions of listening till you like it, that's not something you should have to endure. Pleasure should be immediate and apparent. I could probably learn to like having my teeth drilled if I did it continually. No, download the free sample, decide for yourself, and ultimately, save your money."
2,Very Dissapointing,"I am afraid I have to agree with ""Disappointing"" (October 5) and ""It Hurts Me To Write This"" (October 4). This CD has GREAT instrumental work, but the song lyrics are the weakest of any Paul Simon work. VERY DISAPPOINTING!"
4,"Excellent, but very different.","Paul Simon has always been my favorite artist. From the days of Simon & Garfunkel, he has always been an obviously phenomenal musician and songwriter. His music has a tradition of brilliance as well as catchiness. His huge album ""Graceland"" was probably his pinnacle for catchy music and success.In ""You're The One"", he returns to a smaller production performance that is slightly reminiscent of Paul Simon from before 1980, but he also adopts a weird ""coffeehouse"" kinda vibe that I've never heard in his music before. It is a very good album (hence, 4 stars). Paul once again came up with a completely new sound for his newest album, just as he had accomplished with ""Graceland"". It is a different style of music that what I've come to expect, as if he threw away popular influence in order to create an entirely personal work of art."
3,"Not the best, but not all that bad","I really think alot of people wan't to really like this album but just can't. It is very different, which could be good and could be bad."
1,Simon has lost his touch...,"When an artist as popular as Paul Simon takes an ten year hiatus from releasing a proper studio album (disregarding the 1997 debacle ""Songs from the Capeman""), you expect the new release to be near perfect. Unfortunately, Simon doesn't deliver. To deliver the lyrical punch of his latest album, it seems that Simon apparently stole a third-grader's rhyming dictionary. On ""Old,"" Simon's preachy three-chord ode to God himself apparently, he rhymes such classics as ""old"", ""mold"", ""cold"", and ""sold."" Brilliant. Simon has left behind the accessible and interesting songs of yore and opted to offer the listener a disjointed collection of songs that trudge along with no clear direction or variation. The songs on ""You're the One"" are pleasant enough if you're using them for background music, just don't think about them too hard or they'll drive you nuts."
2,Not the One,"I had a funny thought when I was listening to this severely disappointing album: this is actually the first truly mediocre release from Paul Simon in a recording career that has now spanned nearly 40 years. But there's simply no denying that YOU'RE THE ONE is riddled with weak, and occasionally shockingly bad, material. For every solid, affecting tune like ""Hurricane Eye"" there's a clumsy embarrassment like ""Pigs, Sheep, and Wolves"" to kill the momentum. And the list of horrors doesn't stop there: the title track is pedestrian; ""Darling Lorraine"" can't decide if it wants to be cute or epic (and so it settles for being a cute epic, which is just as bad it sounds, believe me); and ""Old"", with it's lyrics lifted straight from the Born Again Cheerleaders Handbook, sounds like Pat Robertson gettin' the funk out. Unbelievable."
1,Worst Paul Simon Album Ever!!,"Horrible. This is the word that I kept muttering to myself as I listened to the new Paul Simon album. As I was buying ""You're The One"" I had visions of ""Graceland"" dancing through my head. That is, I believe, one of the best albums I've ever heard. It sounds as great today as it did fifteen years ago. His follow up, ""The Rhythm of the Saints"", was also very good. But whatever you do, don't go expecting his new one to be anywhere in the same ballpark as those two. That was my mistake and I couldn't have been more disappointed. There's not one song that has a memorable melody. The songwriting is weak to say the least. And that half singing/half speaking thing he does is incredibly annoying. He's done it only sparingly in the past so it's never bothered me that much, but he does it way too much on this album. If he just wants to read bad poetry than he needs to go ahead and do that. That way the rest of us who prefer music can save our money and skip it."
2,Creative Small Potatoes From a Musical Landmark,"After the intoxicating experimentation of ""Graceland"" and the sorrowful poetry of ""The Capeman"", ""You're the One"" gives us quiet meditative songs that are pleasant enough. Unfortunately, none of the tunes--with the exception of the charming ""old""-- speak eloquently about missigivings within relationships and personal needs that are Simon's hallmark. This album will leave you with a puzzled frown on your face and dissapointed expectations."
4,Don't listen just once,"Paul Simon is/was a genius. But on the first take, I was disappointed by this album. I was ready to put it aside and move on. But, giving him the benefit of a doubt, I came back to it. By the 4th play I was hooked. There is a lot here; not the immediately compelling rhythms of Graceland or the transparent grace of Rhythm of the Saints or accessible poetry of Hearts and Bones, BUT: some really fine songs and musicianship, if you give it time and a chance."
5,We Were There for Capeman,"Our family attended the Broadway debut of ""Capeman"" and were energized by the music and story. Despite the popular point of view, we voted yes! Now we vote yes (along with the popular point of view) for Paul Simon's newest CD. Favorites are ""Pigs, Sheep, and Wolves,"" ""Hurricane Eye,"" and ""Love."""
