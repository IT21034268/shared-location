3,Fetch My Brain-Drill!...,"My interest in this movie stems from my fascination w/ mind control, government conspiracy, and mad science / experiments gone wrong. Though all of these elements are present, THE MIND SNATCHERS is just too long and slow. This would have made an excellent 20-30 min. short, or anthology segment. As it is, TMS has a bloated mid-section, sandwiched between a decent beginning and a perfectly downbeat ending. Christopher Walken (THE DEAD ZONE, THE PROPHECY) plays the violent, angry Reese w/ his typical ease and un-forced oddness. Ronny Cox (DELIVERANCE, THE BEAST WITHIN, ROBOCOP) is also good as Reese's unhinged, hillbilly roommate. Shaved down, this could have been a classic..."
3,Strangest Tea Party EVER,"I am not exagerating when I say that this CD is a polite hallucination: A late-aternoon tea party with the slanted light heavy on the wooden floor, stirring up the dust mites around the heads of Sally Field, Dudley Moore, Peter Cook, Angela Lansbury, Cat Stevens, a particularly large white Teddy Bear and a girl in a red raincoat (isn't she hot?) and violet umbrella. When you drink the piping tea, your lexicon is reduced to the letters of the alaphabet, letters that trip off your tongue to the halting beat of a music-box tune (where is that music box?). There is nothing more to say....."
3,Very straight-forward insight,"Book has some helpful (though somewhat one-sided) discussion regarding the ""why"" of expository preaching, but also some help in formulating the ""how"" of expository preparation."
2,Basic and boring,"Chapell has contributed almost nothing to the art of preaching that has already been said before. The one glimmer of hope that he may add something of value to sermon development tucked away in the tenth chapter regarding what he calls the ""Fallen Condition Focus."" His handling of the elements of the sermon, expositions, application, illustration, are reiterations of what has all been written before. Furthermore, there is no permeation of Christ-centeredness into any of the elements."
5,Another Great Book,I enjoyed this book and use it from time to time to get other ideas for messages. It would be great if we all live the Christ centered life and quit living for self or selfish reasons.
1,Rip Off,"Turns out the cleaner solution is DISTILLED WATER. Cloth covered ""brush"" not really large enough to get a good handle on it. Could so as well with a towel and water. NOT WORTH THE PRICE>"
1,A RIP OFF,"I ORDERED THIS SET BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD DEAL...$25 DOLLARS FOR THREE NEEDLES AND THE WHOLE KIT SET...I WANTED IT BECAUSE OF THE NEEDLES...WHEN I GOT IT...IT WAS JUST THE WOOD LINT COVER CASE THING AND A SMALL PLASTIC BOTTLE THAT SAID ""DISTILLED WATER"" AND NO NEEDLES! I CALLED THEM AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD RETURN MY MONEY BECAUSE THEY ""DONT HAVE IN STOCK"" ANY NEEDLES...RIPOFF!"
1,COMPLETE RIPOFF !!!!!!!!!!!!!,Your are getting a piece of cloth glued to a block of wood and a bottle of distilled water for your money. THERE WERE NO NEEDLES INCLUDED!!! I called Crosley and they said they stopped including needles with this item a long time ago yet Amazon still advertises it and shows pictures of the three needles even though they are no longer included. Very deceptive.Amazon sent me a return shipment tag and promised to refund my money but it still took my time (and money) in bringing the package to the UPS store for the return.
3,a grower; but Bernard's best is still to come,"Fans of Suede Mark I will have a tough time wrestling with this one. There are enough snatches of his trademark ""big"" sound to keep us happy, but too often it sounds as if he's deliberately working against his strengths, stripping down his sound to let his (rather callow and undeveloped) voice shine through. After listening to ""Not Alone"" and realizing anew just how exhilarating his music can be, you can't help thinking he's holding back during much of the rest of the album. Still, there's a half dozen pretty great songs here, and even some of the acoustic numbers, most notably ""You Light the Fire"", are quite beautiful. This one definitely takes time to get into, and by and large it's worth it, but I think the next album will be even better."
4,An excellent album!,"Although not worthy of a five-star rating, I'd say this is definitely a great album! There are songs on here that make you ponder about past relationships, make you wish you were in love, calm your nerves, and more. It's much like the Pumpkins' ""Siamese Dream"", but without the metal antics and with more lushness. Yes, it can put you to sleep, but just skip to ""Stay"" and you'll feel the yearning of love sweep over you. Okay, so that may sound cheesy! It's not a cheesy album by any means! It's quite beautiful. ...."
3,Good ridence to Suede,"I could never stand the band suede with their rip off glam rock/pop music, but whenever I heard their early stuff I couldn't help but notice the work of their guitarist B.Butler. He has now done the honourable thing and left Suede to start a solo career, and this is a promising start. Instead of the plastic rubbish Suede used to produce, you are left with a warm number brimming with class. His acoustic and electric playing is superb, and he is probably up amoung the Marrs(Smiths / Electronic) and Squires (Stone Roses / Seahorses) of the world. 'You just know' and 'Not Alone' are highlights of the album, however, the songs themselves are not as faultless as Butler's playing, ther is too much of the same thing which is alright for the first 6 or 7 songs but after 12 its just annoying (its not helped by Butler's pathetic voice). I would recommend this album, but for the guitar work and not the songs themselves."
3,"Good, not great","I guess I was disappointed with this, but not totally. The guitar work is great, vintage Bernard, but the lyrics are pretty terrible and his voice is so weak and generic. This is particularly jarring when I'm used to Brett's poetic lyrics and unique delivery married to Bernard's delicious licks. So in the post DogManStar contest, it's Suede 1, Butler 0. But this cd is still better than 99% of the stuff out there--I just hope he can find a singer/lyricist to work with."
3,"George Harrison, where are you?","~Bernard finally escapes the Johnny Marr-designed cage of Brit session weirdo and does it his way. Why it sounds so much like confidence thing down, perhaps someone could convince him it's OK to rock out again?"
5,this man has skills!,"great album. it nevers stays at the same pace or repeats the same riff, and the tracks are all varied in length, not limited to a verse chorus verse structure. it is entirely a guitar album - no songwriting here - but BB uses his guitar as his voice throughout the album. if you like a good guitar bassline and solo, and want an album rather than a set of songs, you can't go wrong."
4,"one neil, worth the wait","Still jaded by the break up of my favorite band (Crowded House) Neil's first album took months to grow on me. One Nil, on the other hand has made an instant bond with me, and is worth the trouble of importing asap, since we can't buy it in the us yet. Soon my pretty little musice jem.... soon"
3,CD,"Love the item, but it took a while to get to me, i had to email to find out where my product was? I'm vry happy with the CD but not happy with how long it took t get to me!"
3,Sounds really good - but noisy,"Still give it 3 stars.... Sounds surprisingly good for a 30' input cable. a little bit of attenuation on volume, but easily made up for on amp. Nice mid's and high's... again, especially for 30' of cable.BUT the physical cable creates considerable noise when shaken or as it drags across floor or stage. If you have high gain on amp you'll definitely notice it. I should've bought the more expensive version to see if any improvement in that area. But still great to have a flexible coil cord... haven't used one in 30+ years!"
3,Good and good looking guitar but it tends to tangle.,"My band goes to great lengths to make everything on stage white when we play. For a while finding a white belt and dress shoes was holding me up, but in the end the only hole in my ensemble was the black cord hanging out of my white jazz bass. This cable definitely solved that problem, but it tends to tangle badly when it's stored.Our guitar player has the Vox version and it seems to tangle a bit less."
3,Tiny,These earrings are very small. I guess there was a description or measurement somewhere but I was disappointed and do not wear them due to the very small size (length).
3,it's okay,way toooooo small !!!!!i was looking for something biggerso i gave it to my little sister .... .
4,lauraf,I just received these earrings . They are just like the picture. They are smaller than what I imagined but I am still pleased. They are very light and you don't even know you are wearing them. I like the clasping mechanism on them and feel secure that they won't come undone. Great price. Received really quick even in the midst of xmas!! I would definately recommend them for someone who wants subtle gold earring.
3,Nice but small,"They were smaller than I expected. They are still nice and will make a nice gift, but I am slightly disappointed."
3,Good for everyday wear.,"I purchased these because I lost my favorite 14K gold pair. These turned out to be smaller than I expected, but they stay on securely and are good for travel. They fit the bill for what I needed and I don't worry so much about losing them."
5,Gr8 Ying Yang,this track is not about rap. anyone can rap this. the twins just whispering this so it's not a big deal but they found awesome beat with collipark so it was a big club banger in this summer. lyrics are a lil bit boring but i hope this track will win this year's VMA @ Miami :-D
4,What about the people of the U.S?,"This book gives a personal glimpse into the true character of our elected officials, FEMA, and the federal government as a whole in an emergency situation---it's abominable. So many passed Katrina suffering off....not wanting to hear the real truth. Our fellow citizens were in dire need of the basics to survive and were largely ignored and left to suffer in unimaginable conditions in this country. Instead of sending $$ to other nations that never intend to pay us back.....we need to be taking care of our own. President Bush requested a ""fly over"" on his way back to DC, from vacation in Crawford, TX. BIG DEAL!!!! Mayor Nagan is a pitiful man....hiding out, not addressing his people or calming fears, and sadly was re-elected!!!!What's happening to this country??????pam"
2,What a disappointment,"How can Brinkley call himself an historian? If nothing else, readers expect historians to get basic facts right. And as one reviewer has said already, the factual errors in the first pages alone are enough to destroy this historian's credibility. On the other hand, Brinkley is a great story teller and a gripping writer. Scene after vivid scene keep you reading, and in part redeem the book's glaring errors."
5,The Great Deluge by Douglas Brinkley,"I ordered this book because I survived Hurricane Katrina and I know first hand what it was like. This book just puts you there. It mostly talks about what happened in New Orleans....I was in Mississippi. I don't especially agree with the author's political views, but he did an excellent job in telling what it was like before, during, and after the most devastating event of my (and thousands of others)life."
1,Too opinionated!,"If you hate President Bush, you'll love this book. But if you are seeking a true historical account (which the book does not contain unfortunately) of a major disaster without all the left-wing editorial padding, skip this book."
1,The Great Disappointment,"I was greatly disappointed with most of the book. The inane references to songs and favorite music of the person being showcased were clumsily done and added nothing to the story or the in providing a personal insight on the person in question.""Leaders"" at most levels came in for justified savaging. Noted that Blanco was treated far too kindly and there was absolutely no mention of Mary Landrieu's initial laurels for all the ""heroic"" Louisiana politicians followed by unending shrieking because the congress chose not to pass her demanded $250 billion recovery bill writen by lobbyists. References to any of the Morials as concerned statesmen was almost too much to bear.I wasted my money buying the book. If you want to read inecssant Bush hating, save your money and just read molly ivans'on-going drivel."
2,Liberal,"I wish I had known the author was a liberal before I purchased and read the book.I was born and raised in the New Orleans area, and my sister had a home in Bay St Louis, so I was very interested in the real workings of Mayor Nagin and Governor Blanco, before, during, and after the storm. Both should be charged with negligence.I began to get very angry toward the end of the book, then realized how liberal Mr. Brinkley is. I've wasted my time.I thought I would like to read his book on John Kerry, but now I know I will never read another book written by him."
5,A powerful book,"I ordered this book before I saw the author on all the talk shows, and it still lived up to all the hype that usually goes along with ""talking heads"". It is unbelievably compelling: I read it on vacation and could not put it down and have promised to pass it on to my husband, daughter and son in law. It left me with the impression that the people of the gulf coast are to be commended for their courage in the face of such Political ignorance and apathy. Why the current administration (nationally and locally) has not been indicted for the apathy (not a strong enough word!) with which they treated the coming storm and its aftermath continues to be the big question.I strongly recommend this book to any one who is a student of history, politics or the south."
4,A Review From Someone Who Was In Katrina,"This is a great book. It is an easy read.I do think, however, that the author missed some aspects of life in this area.The word mandatory is a misnomer. There is no such thing. This is a free country. You are free to stay--and you are free to die. Many people do not leave because they know that their homes will then be looted. This is expecially true for the poor who own very little already.When you live on the gulf coast, you grow up knowing that there are certain things you do for a hurricane. 4 days before, 3 days before, 2 days before, 1 day before. This is common knowledge. This book is an eye opener as to the lack of knowledge in some areas. Something that for Mobilians doesnt make any sense.With all this said, however, FEMA itself is a disaster."
2,Poorly written,"I am sorry to report that I think this book is poorly written and edited. It has numerous factual errors, and a lot of the anecdotes collected by the author cannot be verified. If you are looking for a collection of oral histories about Katrina, you might be satisfied, but if you are looking for rigorous history or journalism, pass this one by.It did not include a map of New Orleans, which would have been very helpful to the reader."
1,Incorrect,I was deployed with a FEMA urban search and rescue task force to Katrina and spent two weeks after the storm working in New Orleans. The author of this book relies on reporters mostly to gather his data. The parts of the book that describe events that I was personally involved with are grossly inaccurate and obviously written by someone who wasn't there and instead relied on an account of someone who didn't understand what was happening. Save your money. The book is too inaccurate to be considered a history lesson.
5,Leadership Secrets of the World's Most Successful CEO's,Only book I have ever seen on leadership worth reading. I've read a lot about the author since reading his book. Pretty interesting guy. Also caught him on Fox a while back. Fascinating interview. Big ego. But he seems to back it up for the past couple decades from all I have read. Can't wait for his next book! Hope this is a series?
5,Leadership Secrets of the World's Most Successful CEO's,This book is like the Hall of Fame for Smart CEOs and advice. Easy read. Great little bits of inspiring insightful and valuable information. Information cuts right to the chase. Highly recommend this one!
1,A Waste,"Maybe the world's most successful as described by the title, however, this book is not in the same category. A dull, uninspired effort to translate an uninspiring message. A waste of your $'s."
2,Superficial at best,I don't think that I personally learned anything from this book --Management is a blend of many traits and values. I don't believe this book is a condensate of anything I have not read before and I do not believe it adds to the practice of management.
5,Leadership Secrets of the World's Most Successful CEO's,"Perfect book on the topic. Honestly I only read two thirds of this book, but based on the way it was written, you can sort of read what you choose to and disregard the rest. The author got 100 big names and companies. It's a pretty impressive list of CEO's. Absolutely worth reading!"
2,Leadership Secrets of the World's Most Succcessful CEO's,"Seems to me like the guy who wrote the book was a better ""leader"" than anyone in the book. The NY Times even said that. Too bad he didn't write more about himself. Then again, he's probably as much of an ego maniac as the arrogant rich losers he profiled. How else would he have gotten them agree to be interviewed. I'd be quite curious to see how many of his ""great leaders"" are in jail in the next 24 months. And who dubbed his selections as the World's Best. Please. The World's Best and they are all from the country he lives in. What crap. I'm being generous giving him two stars."
3,I don't know - haven't read it yet,Joyce Meyer's books are always good. I just haven't read it yet but she's never disappointed me yet. I look forward to reading it in the future
2,This book made me anxious,"Anxiety is a problem I have dealt with for years. I know God calls us to be anxious for nothing and rest on Him. I was hoping this book would encourage me and build me up as I learn to trust Him more. Instead, I felt like the author used the topic to justify her ministry. She relied too much on her own experiences and didn't provide enough truly practical or helpful advice for others dealing with anxiety. This was the first book by Joyce Meyer I have read, and I was not very impressed."
3,There are more inspirational books,"To find serenity and peace I think you need to read a book by someone who lives it on a daily basis and just not writes about it. I recenlty read a Brush with Darkness by Lisa Fittipaldi and this book, as no other I have read this year, touched my soul and my heart and has led me to a better understanding of my path in life."
1,Not enough psychological components,Too many bible verses made reading difficult. Too much of blaming anxiety on the devil instead of the person's reaction to stress.
5,Be Anxious For Nothing,"Be Anxious for Nothing: The Art of Casting Your Cares and Resting in GodI highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to not only get closer to God, but be able to use Godly principles in their daily lives. This book, along with the accompanying Study Guide, has made a great impact in my life. I was so impressed with God's word presented by Joyce Meyer, that I bought a set for my sister and her husband. It is great to use as a daily devotional at your own pace."
2,Appeal lost on me,"As one who loves good literature and cats, I was eager to own this book after reading the reviews. I was disappointed with each and every page! I found the story and the 'characters' lacking both depth and interest. I am not familiar with the author, but closed the book wishing he had allowed someone else to put his sketches to word."
4,...,"Your usual trademark Snuff with a little more staying power. This was originally released 18 years ago, and still remains ahead of the melodic punk rock pack. It was ahead of it's time then, and is ahead of it's time now."
2,some punks will probably like it.,It's not that i dont like this record it's just since i got it it's just never really grown on me that much at times im listning to it and am actually enjoying it and other times it just bores me but having said that snuff have that effect on me around about half of there albums such as demma and disposable income etc... i really like and the other half such as numb nuts and flibby etc just fail to intrest me. It probably will appeal to you if you are into the punk genre but the 2 stars that i gave snuff said are valid from my perspective.
5,GREAT!,"I really like this tire. Why? It GRIPS on everything I've tried! It isn't incredibly knobby, so it also rolls very well. I've used it on mud, wet leaves, sand, snow, ice, gravel, cement, pavement etc... Still love it. Really deep mud it slips , same as the ice, but find me a tire that does, without studs. I have put about 600km on the tire and it still looks new. I'd recommend it!"
5,Seaquest Season 1 - It couldda been a contender,The first season of Seaquest is one of the best Sci-Fi series since Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. The fact that the ratings forced the writers to go hog wild with fantasy and force Roy Scheider off the show because of his disgust is a sad commentary on our society that can't just appreciate good writing for what it is.
4,Sea Quest memories,"I liked Sea Quest when I was a kid. And as an adult it brought back memories of my childhood. I can see now that it was a little cheesy, but it is a good show for kids and I also really liked how Bob Ballard from Woodshole gave a little science bit at the end of each show. Overall it is a good collection."
4,Great season of a good series,"I was a big fan of this series and even though it got cheesy - watched it all the way through. Of course the first season was the best and I loved the little ""real science"" guy at the end telling about discoveries and advances they are working on.on a sad note, I was a big Jonathan Brandis fan and was so very sad when I learned about his very tragic death."
5,Finally!!,"They finally came out with the first season which is AWESOME!! Now if they only come out with the other seasons as well, I will be very happy. If you loved the show on the original run or in reruns, get it. If your a huge sci-fi fan anyways, get this. You will really like it. It is an awesome show!!"
5,Entertaining,We have always enjoyed Seaquest and I was delighted to see that it was on DVD. It is still as entertaining as it was when it first came out. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes to be entertained.
5,So glad it's here!,"I enjoyed the first season of Seaquest DSV, and the DVD set is pretty good. It would have been nice to have a tribute somewhere to Jonathan Brandis. Only on the first DVD is it marked ""Side A"" and ""Side B,"" so I can't always tell what I'm going to be playing until I start the DVD. Other than that, I'm enjoying watching the series again and would recommend it as fun family viewing."
4,Excellent Series and good season!,"Great. Love this series. Great ideas, good actors/actresses, cheezy dialogue, and sappy story lines, i just love to watch it. Don't ask why, I just thoroughly enjoy this dvd set. Of course, Jonathan Brandis is a plus . . . . Plus, the whole exploring the sea thing? Totally original TV series idea - unlike space which has been done, done, and done again."
5,Best earplugs for swimming,"I went through two other models before I found these. They are soft and easy to put into the ear, just remember to twist them to get them out. The seal is tight and comfortable."
4,Fits well and reuseable,"These are completely reuseable. Try to make sure they're completely dry before putting them in. I get the best results when I put them in relatively deep. It feels a little uncomfortable but you get used to it, and it'll keep ALL the water out."
3,a little pricey,"bought these for swimming. seem to work ok, but thought theywere a little pricey just for earplugs. Don't know if I would recommend."
5,Comfortable and work great!,"I got tired of uncomfortable swimming earplugs that leaked, so I decided to take a chance on these earplugs. The reviews were very positive and the price was reasonable, so I purchased 2 pair. Once the plugs arrived I opened the package and placed one of the plugs into my ear to test the fit. All I can say is WOW! These things are soft, comfortable, and had a super seal. I actually got a little nervous removing the plugs for the first time because the seal had created a small vacuum that made them not want to come out very easily. I was used to my old earplugs practically falling out of my ears, which is one of the reasons they leaked water.I swim daily and these things are not going to make my ears sore from inserting and removing them like my old ones did. The water seal was great and I didn't get a single drop of water in my ears while swimming. I highly recommend these plugs to swimmers!"
4,KEEPS WATER OUT,GOT THESE FOR MY GRAND CHILDREN WHO HAVE TUBES IN THEIR EARS. DOES KEEP THE WATER OUT. WISH THEY WERE A BRIGHTER COLOR SO YOU CAN FIND THEM EASILY.
5,Great Product,I just recently found these and bought them. I swim 2-3 times per week about one mile each day and I cannot survive without ear plugs! The other type I used were stiff and hurt my ears as I used them. I have had these ear plugs for just over 2 weeks and I realize that may not be enough time to yet say with assurity but I really like these plugs! They are comfortable in my ears and are soft yet keep the water out and not irritating to the tender part of my ear!!! Hopefully they will not stiffen up with time but I will watch for that but as of now I like them alot!
2,Not happy,"I have small ears, I guess. I only got these to properly fit in once. Lost one on the second swim try. Read others tips and still had no luck. Had better luck with the silicon waxy things, though I hate how those collect debris.Not for everyone, it seems."
2,they don't stay in,"these plugs are not rigid enough at all to stay in the ear. i've tried and worn so many different types of plugs since i had my ear tube surgery and my audiologist taught me how to put them in so i know i'm doing it right. but if i so much as move my jaw to speak while taking a bath with these things in they start to fall right out and water gets in, which is quite painful when there is a hole in your eardrum. also, despite having pediatric-sized ears even as an adult, they are too small. the part shaped like a christmas tree doesn't have enough girth and the stem is too short to hold onto easily enough to get them in as far as they really need to go, which is likely why they keep sliding out. granted, most others are far too big, which is why i tried these. but these are much too small and much too squishy to work. something in-between would be perfect."
5,Couldn't be any better!,"I've used the ear plugs 3 times so far and have no complaints. I was worried about them falling out of my ears, but they stay in VERY well and do not let ANY water in. My only complaint is, albiet a small one, that I wish the ear plugs were colored and not clear. The other day I took one out of my ear and dropped in the water of the pool and it was very difficult to find. That said, these are very reasonably priced and work VERY well so I would have purchased a replacement pair anyway.If you're looking for earplugs you can buy these without worry. They work great and are comfortable!"
4,I wish they had an extra ring -,"I purchased these to replace an old pair of Speedo swimming ear plugs -Description -They really look like the pictures and they are soft but not too soft - they have 3 rings(?) -The Pros -- Easy in , although it took me a while to get used to having to pull my ear up to let them in- comfortable , no ear irritation- easy out , easier if you twist them a little bit before pulling- they seem to stay in the same position for the duration of a 45 min swimThe Cons- sometimes they let a little air in and you would hear a funny popping noise everytime the head goes in the waterThe use -I use them 3-4 times / week for around 45 min and they keep the form and seal just fine for that duration - I have not notice any degradation on the material during the 1 month I have been using them -I wish ...I wish they had an extra ring , 4 instead of 3overall a great Product - :) happy with them"
4,soft and easy to insert,I use these for swimming since I tend to get swimmers ears if I get water inside my ears. These are easy to place but they do slip out a bit.
5,Great product!,"These plugs are wonderful! They are just the right size, so they will keep water out of my ears without putting too much pressure on my eardrum. I'm very glad I got them!"
3,My ears no likey no wetness,"I got these because I suffer dearly from ear infections after swimming in the pool. These did an OK job of keeping water out but nothing awesome like I was expecting. Im planning on getting a swimming cap and putting these underneath to see if that does the trick. Hey, I'll look like michael phelps, I just need a red white and blue speedo now"
5,Great plugs,"Been using these for a few weeks now, and they are great. Way better than the wax plugs. Easy to put in and take out with no water in the ear to report. Will buy again when these wear out."
3,Effective but ...,"It does the job of preventing the water from entering my ear but I have to keep adjusting it to a certain angle to keep it in place. I am still using it but I am already in search for a new ear plug that will stay in place. Not all ears are the same so if this fits your ear then good for you. I, however, will have to keep searching."
4,Earplugs are comfortable,"The earplugs are easy to find on the counter (since they are purple !) and easy to fit in your ear. The left one has a tendency to come lose in my ear during my shower (maybe I am not fitting it properly since I am right handed), but the right one stays tight and keeps the water out."
5,make me enjoy swimming more!,Block water well. Super soft. I love them!I ordered another box for my mom. She has ruptured eardrum. These earplugs should work well for her when she takes a shower.
5,I like these earplugs,"I bought this 'Mack's AquaBlock Earplugs - Clear' at Amazon. It works well to me. It's not too big so my ears are not hurt when I have the swimming cap on - the cap presses on the head, you know. Its color is clear, so less noticed. I will buy them again."
1,sucks,This product is very cheaply made. One little wind storm and the seams came pulling apart. As for the seller they were great to work with. sent the stuff right away. Thanks.
1,dont waste your money.,"!!!!!!ITEM RETURNED!!!!!!I wouldn't waste my money on this product. its not like the picture where is goes down half the pool, it maybe goes down 10 inches. it holds on with draw strings in one spot, and with 2 adults pulling the strings it still doesn't get tight. it lays in the water, not nice and tight like the picture.!!!! SEE THE PICTURE I SUBMITTED THAT IS WHAT YOU GET!!!!It has fallen off 3 times already,(have had it 2 days now) and it was not even windy, we also tried putting a innertube under it too, still to no avail. you would be just as good if you bought a tarp,"
3,Not the best cover,"We bought this cover for our 12 ft. metal frame pool, and it's ok, but it's hard to get it taunt around the pool. Really, it just fits it, and a larger one would probably work better. My husband tries to get it taunt but it's really hard too. When a wind comes up, most of the time, it gets blown up on one side or the other. So, this cover really does not do a great job for us keeping garbage out of our pool. All in all, I probably would not recommend this size cover but a larger size for your 12 ft. pool."
2,So-So Item,"The cover tore easily around the seam. Would not take alot of tension or pulling when putting it on the pool, before it tore."
1,Useless and complete waste of money!,"I bought the item despite some of the bad reviews I read about this pool cover, thinking ""how bad could it be?"". It is completely useless. First, this pool cover sinks in the middle when installed and no matter how much I tried with two other adults, we could not make it look like it is advertised in the picture. Second, once it is put over the pool, it cannot withstand a reasonable amount of breeze. I wish I can send it back and get my money back!"
1,Bad product,It took me almost a month to get this pool cover and when I did get it the wind blew it off and ripped it right away.
1,Intex Pool Cover,There no way that we have found to keep the cover off the top of the water. So therefore it does not drain the water into the pool and is a big hassle! Had to take off because of winds.
1,12 Ft Cover for Intex Style Frame Pools,I bought this cover for my frame type pool like the one pictured and the cover is CRAP. It says intex on the top and it has holes in it(not sure why looks like it was made this way). It lets all kinds of leaves and bugs into my pool. the cover does NOT fit properly. The seams are ripping.I have a 12 ft pool and this cover is TOO big. the drawstring does not work properly and its ripping in that area too.It does not work well in a heavy rain either.It does not stay above the water because you cant get the cover tight enough.I am NOT happy with this cover and would never buy one again.You would be better off buying a tarp big enough to cover the pool and tying it down.It is definitely NOT worth the price.
2,12Ft Cover for Intex Frame POOLS,"Didn,t like the product. it was to lite weight. Wouldn,t stay on.Didn't last long. Maybe try something difference this year"
2,Warms the pool but makes mildew in the water,"I love the warm water but after a few days, water has mildew in it.... I guess it needs more air flow...."
5,DC Cab,"Loved the movie when I originally saw it in the '80's, and enjoyed it again on Amazon Instant Video. It's just a good comedy, something that you rarely see anymore."
5,Very pleased,"Had to replace wedding band, lost after 37 years on my finger. Just received this ring within 48 hours of placing order and am completely satisfied...very attractive."
5,nice present,The watch was nice and presented in a nice box. The recipient was very happy with the present. Than you
3,Not easy reading,"This is not one of Andre Norton's best novels. The dialogue goes into long speeches in a style that loses your attention. The story appears to start in the middle of something, and gives the readers a feeling that they may have missed a previous book. It is a complex fantasy that skips back and forth between characters, and there is one large jump forward in time. Overall, it is a somewhat interesting tale of an evil mage aspiring to power, but the story drags, and it is hard to identify a central character."
2,Disappointment from a Master of Fantasy,"I have LITERALLY read everything that Ms. Norton has written and I can count the number of times I've been less than delighted on the fingers of one hand. Well, this is one of those times. She delivered such a gem in A SCENT OF MAGIC that my expectations were high for this one. But a WIND IN THE STONE is a disjointed mishmash of a story with characters you spend too little time with to get to know. Skip this one, especially in hard cover, and read the paperback if you absolutely must."
2,She could do tons better,How I treid to finsh it! I couldn't get past the first 70/80 pages or so. the only part that interested me was Irasmus. I wanted to find out more about him and his thoughts. The narrative is sometimes confusing and it is hard to empathize with the characters. It is very hard to get ino the book
1,It was broken,"I was so looking foreword to watching the movie went I found it in the box. But, when I put it in to the dvd - the dvd kept spitting it back out. I evern took it to my friends house and tryed her dvd - and it kept spitting it out. So, sad to say I was very unhappy with this product. Sorry--Vic"
2,To Live For,"I read what this movie is about. Sounds like a very, very, depressing movie!!! A real downer of a movie... I recommand not watching it. Why get yourself upset..."
3,Disappointing,"I found this volume in the Sharpe saga to be somewhat disappointing. The plot seemed very contrived and Sharpe was somewhat out of character. The actual battle of Vitoria, which was one of Wellington's most glorious successes, seems almost an after-thought here. The intrigue surrounding Ducos, in retrospect seemed irrelevant and the Slaughterman too much of a characature to believe. Nevertheless, it's worth reading if for no other reason than completeness."
3,Not my favorite,I've been reading Sharpe's adventures (mostly) in order. This book is my least favorite thus far. Several characters (Sharpe included) seem to act out of character. Eventually I just wanted it to end as it became predictably boring.
2,It's for nostalgists only,"I bought this as a gift years ago, and after a couple uses it was left unused for a long time. I admit I was enamored by the vintage look of this unit but the sound quality is so poor it's only worth anything as a novelty. finally managed to sell it off to someone for a small fraction because I didnt feel it was worth anything close to what I paid.For $100 and a little luck you could easily buy something off of CL made 20 years ago that would produce ten times better results that this. If you want to relive the glory days of vinyl, cheap reproductions of portable turntables are not the way to go."
3,Horror in Red!,"Sound is good speed is fine my problem is some records play fine others stop while playing. Some times it skips across record. Will drive you crazy!!! Get something else PLEASE!Crosley CR711 Autorama Turntable with AM/FM Radio, Red"
1,Worked great at first... now it is garbage,"I got this as a replacement for my bulky, multi-component stereo system that I had bought in the 80s. At first this was a great compact way to play my vinyl.I have had it two years and the sound has never been great but I thought it was a good value. Now one day the speed got all messed up for no reason at all. I agree with the other negative reviews. It is plastic junk in the long run.I wonder how many of the positive reviews are made right after they purchased it. If you want something to last a week or a month, then this is a good value. If you want something to last a decade or so, open the wallet a little more and buy something worthwhile."
1,Nice Looking Piece of Junk,"Very cheaply made -- when I play a record, I can hear radio static with muffled voices coming through the speaker. Heavy records make the turntable surface tilt, causing the record's edge to scrape the side of the unit. One of the worst purchases I have ever made. Stay away from this player -- it looks cool but as far playing records, it's a piece of junk."
1,Plastic Junk,"The Turntable on this unit is very cheap and is made of very lightweight plastic. This causes the turntable to be weighed down when you place a record on it, which in turn causes the record to rub against the edges of the unit... resulting in a warped sound output. If you want to spend 150.00 on a old fashion looking radio, go right ahead. But if you want to spin LP records without them sounding warped, don't waste your time and money. Looks cool, sounds and performs lousy."
1,A Real Disappointment!,"I had been shopping around for a record player for a long time and finally settled on the Crosley CR711 retro, red in color. I went with Crosley because I know it was a name I could trust. I was so excited when I received my record player...that is, until I put the first record on. The music sounded like the record was warped, although I knew it wasn't. I kept trying different records, still the same quality. To make a long story short, after multiple e-mails and phone calls, Crosley agreed to have the record player returned to them for repair at their expense. Again, another disappointment. That was two weeks ago. I had to pay for the shipping, I still have not received my record player, and when I sent another e-mail, I was told a part had to be ordered and the record player was still under repair. The whole experience - VERY disappointing! It's not like I can cough up another $130.00 for a record player!!!"
2,"Audio sounds cheap, looks cheaper.","This unit is made of cheap looking, thin plastic. The sound it nothing to brag about. Please see reviews of ""Crosley CR711 Autorama Turntable with AM/FM Radio, Red"" before purchasing. (Please search for this same unit, in the red color, on this website and consider the reviews before making your decision to purchase the Crosley CR711, in any color.)"
4,"it's SNUFF, what more do you need to know?","if you like SNUFF, you won't be disappointed with this. Pink Purple is one of my absolute favorite SNUFF songs ever."
5,AS GOOD AS THE FIRST.,"For their sophomore effort, the Hellecasters have continued the musical soundscapes they explored in their first CD. Check out track 10, ""Le Journee Des Tziganes"" (wish I could pronounce it!) for some unbelievable percussion."
2,Really quite boring,"A guy at work, who plays the guitar, lent this CD to me once. He was going on about how these guys were much better than all those famous guitarists who tour the world endlessly and that the music is sweet to taste.I gave it a try. I was really quite bored. Admittedly, it's melodious and everything but so what? There is only so much instrumental guitar a person can listen to unless there is at least a pinch of flamboyance."
3,Enjoyable... for a Tween or Young Teenager,"While I enjoyed some of the moments of the book, the flow seemed awkward and there were times when I felt the characters were a little too one dimensional and contrived.Once I was finished reading the book, I gifted it to a girl who attends the same ballet school as my daughter. She later said she absolutely loved the book. Perhaps the teenage girls in the book were more ""realistic"" to a twelve-year-old than a thirty-something-year-old. Or maybe free books just read better than $8 books do.Overall, good brain candy for a quicky read and an interesting and fun look into the world of the fae, but nothing that drove me to wanting to read more of the Chronicles of Faerie books."
4,the faerie chronicles,"two young teenage cousins....dear lovers of faerie lore,... one visiting the other from Canada, explore modern Ireland in search of the Sidhe, the faerie folk, and find them, and quite a bit more than they bargained for. One girl goes off with the Sidhe and the other goes in search of her and discovers much more than she expected. Similar to Charles DeLint's young adult novels, although not quite as good in our opinion. nonetheless, we enjoyed this first book in the Chronicles of Faerie and will soon order the next one. Check it out.kyela,the silver elves"
4,Faery Delights,"I've just finished this first book in Melling's series. Loved it, and I'm supposedly all grown up! Really a number of excellent things happening in this book. On a personal level, it was a magical memory tour of Ireland for me, as it's been a couple of decades since I've been there, and it brought back so much, but it also gave me a feel for contemporary Ireland. Like the character Gwen, I was pleased to find the fae folk weaving in and out of the everyday lives of the characters. Good depictions of the fae, she caught their mutability beautifully, something that is quite difficult to do.One reviewer disliked the ""sugary"" ending -- well, maybe I'm a sap, but I'll stand by my opinion that the ending was just right, and quite plausible within the way the rules of the Otherworld work. Overall, I found this quite delightful, and would recommend it to readers (of any age) who are interesting in Ireland, and faery lore.Dawn Killen-Courtney, author ofThe Trollton Chronicles"
5,Great Book!,"This book is good for mid teens and seasoned readers alike. Gwen is visiting her cousin Findabhair in Ireland for the summer and the two girls are excited to visit ancient sites. After meeting some odd characters, the girls sleep out under a Sidhe-mound and Findabhair disapears. Gwen must find her and she travels Ireland in a frantic search. I loved the character of Granny and the beautiful descriptions of Ireland now and then make me want to visit it even more. I really enjoyed this book and have read it more than once."
3,Ok,This was an interesting read about the realm of fairy. The story was ok and the characters good but it lacked something.I really liked how it all came together in the end. I would recommend for 14 and up.
2,Hunter's Moon,"Hunter's Moon went by pretty fast for me, mostly because there wasn't much going on. The cousins decide to stay inside a faerie mound, one chooses to go away with the faerie and the other chases after her thinking she was kidnapped. Along the way she meets some nice helpful people that surprisingly believe in faeries (what a coincidence). Of course there is to be a sacrifice on Hunter's Moon, as anyone who is familiar with faerie lore knows, but somehow the characters are surprised by it. I'm surprised the author was able to fit a two sentence plot into 300 pages. Sometimes simplistic is good, if it is made to be endearing and entertaining for example, but this was neither. The characters fell in love too quickly, and there was so much running around we barely got to know them. Another disappointing fae novel."
3,A Good Read,"I actually bought this on accident. I thought I was buying a book by the bass legend Mike Watt, not some guy from Pennsylvania. But when it arrived, I decided to read it anyway, and I am glad I did. It is a very fast read, and no lapses in the action. I like how Watt is not afraid to go for the occasional lame pun, tangent (the Godcorp ads are great, but too over-the-top to be considered satirical), or kitsch reference. Definitely a surprise for me in terms of enjoyability."
3,A little small for your Manduka Black Mat.,"I tried using this bag for a while, however it's a bit small for the black manduka mat."
3,"I enjoyed it, though sometimes boring.","Maybe you have experienced a situation, when you are not able to get away from the book you have started to read. From my point of view, that was not that kind of a book. I read it, because I wanted to know something more about Arthur Andersen itself. I found some very interesting things, mostly about their top brasses and their behaviour, but very often I came across sections, which bored me to death (description of day to day work of the author...etc.). Overall, I recommend this book to all of you, who would like to get to know something more about Arthur Andersen and its greedy behaviour."
5,Excellent Book,"As a former (non-Android) Andersen person who worked closely with many of the people mentioned in Toffler's book right up to the bitter end, I can attest to the accuracy of her inside view of Andersen. Sadly, her experiences there mirrored many of my own and I agree with all of her conclusions about what really caused the downfall of the firm - i.e., it was management (or lack thereof), not the government, that killed the firm. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Andersen specifically or in corporate culture and ethics in general."
2,A so-so read,"I read this and was very interested in the first few chapters. Prior to midway through the book I just wanted it to end. When reading it, I felt like I was reading something an outsider to AA was writing. I don't think the author was imbeded enough in AA to really know what was happening. Based on her limited tenure with AA, she wrote about what she saw, which really doesn't give too much insight. I didn't find out anything new about AA's demise that I didn't already know. Check this one out from the library. Sorry to say, I wouldn't buy it."
2,"Interesting, but questionable accuracy and motive","The book was an interesting read, but since it was written by an ethics consultant who clearly didn't follow the standards that she is trying to preach, it left a bad taste in my mouth. As other reviewers have mentioned -- the author is jaded, bitter, and angry at herself, but still tries to ""teach"" the readers a moral lesson. The result is a book that reads quickly but comes across as terribly one-sided and begs the question of whether this is really a fair portrayal or the work of a bitter ex-employee. Read the book for its anecdotal qualities, not for its ethics lessons or its historical accuracy and insight."
2,The National Enquirer,"As a former Andersen Partner, who, like Barbara, was also an experienced hire, I must say this book reads like the National Enquirer! It sensationalizes the negative and overlooks the many positive things Andersen did for its people and its clients. The firm that I joined and knew helped many clients, and launched and enhanced many careers. The 85,000 people who represented Andersen are your friends, your relatives, your neighbors, your colleagues, your clients and your vendors. The vast majority are people of high intellect and high integrity who did not behave in the manner described in this book. This book is a shameful portrayal of the people of Arthur Andersen that enhances the author's pocketbook at the expense of others' reputations in the community."
2,Personal Aggrandizing,"While I am very interested in the concept that this book is based on, Mrs. Toffler does a terrible job of conveying relevant material to the reader. The book reads like a montage to her personal successes and failures while at Arthur Andersen. It is heavy on subjective material, and lacks the objective material that is necessary to effectively describe the turbulent period of accounting fraud at the beginning of the new millenium. It also involves a myriad of ""he said this to her associate who then relayed the message to her superior who memo'd it to his subordinate who subsequently memo'd it to the firm while contacting a potential client about an existing client"" type of descriptions that can be very confusing and drawn out. I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,An interesting reading for an accounting professional.,"The book is an interesting examination of AA culture that, no doubt, lead to Andersen's demise. (Let's be honest, what company audited the majority of big name clients that had huge restatements?)If you are an accountant, buy this book, read it, compare it to your company, and pray God that you will not work with a person who does not understand the risk of audit failure.I am sure AA parnters new all too well what was going on at Enron or Worldcom or Global Crossing, I don't think they realized how serious were their audit failures.Author examines the culture that deteriorated to the point that it allowed bad audits to continue in the hopes that it would be somebody else's problem.Disclaimer:Of course, the number of people who are responsible for the demise of AA is neglible in comparison to the number of honest and hardworking AA auditors."
1,BEWARE !!!,Jane Eyre 1944WARNING!!! ....This is NOT the 1944 version of Jane Eyre with Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine!! It's a poor quality 1930's version of the JE .I had to give it one star to post this warning.
4,"A good book, which has something written by me in it...","Well, the book finally came out and I picked up a copy of it. All in all, I think it's a pretty good book. It's nice to see writings by boys my age in the midst of all of today's pop-culture ""girl power"" nonsense. Anyway, one of the writings in this book is by me..""My Perfect Wish"" on page 141, I believe. So if you read this and have the book, check it out. Anyway..all in all, the book came out well."
2,"Functional, but ""vintage"" look is cheap sticker","The radio performs well and does what a radio should do, but it's highly disappointing in person. The ""vintage"" covering isn't even cloth -- it's a sticker -- think contact paper on a bad day. I'd rather have a plastic radio that looks quasi-vintage in reality than a sticker wrapped to look like fabric."
4,Cute and functional - good for price,"I bought it for my office and it is my companion - clear reception - cheap plastic exterior, but I don't care"
3,New American bible reader's addition,This was a beautifully bound Bible. I gave it as a gift to a high school graduating granddaughter.
3,LS Lewis The Aboriton of Man,"My advice is to research shipping cost before you make a decission. I ordered a book at the cost of $8.95 and paid $11.95 to ship it. Make sense? NO! There has to be a better way to make shipping costs more clear.Thank you ,John Freschi"
3,Not for rough hands,"The New American Bible is one of the best translations of the Scriptures out there. It is used in the Lectionary for the Mass of the Catholic Church. This publication, however can be difficult to read and handle, due primarily to a small font size and very thin pages. The soft leather cover attracts scratches quite easily, but I can say that it is very attractive (turquoise and black). The fact that the notes and comments for certain verses appear at the end of each book makes reading the references a little difficult. I find myself having to turn to the back of each book constantly to see the translator's comments. If you don't need the notes, this is great for you! It truly is a reader's edition. If you are new to the Bible, I would recommend a version where the notes and Scriptural references appear at the bottom of each page."
4,Great Bible for reading,"This Bible is in a wonderful leather cover with a good matte texture. Unlike many Bibles I've seen, the textual interpretation notes are collected at the end of each book. I prefer this, as I tend to get distracted by these notes when I'm reading. The lectionary at the end is useful for previewing the readings that will be proclaimed at Mass. The sides of the pages bear index tabs, but the Catholic books (e.g., Wisdom, Sirach) are not included on the tabs (the books are included in the Bible, but you'll have to remember their locations in the Old Testament).The one caveat with this Bible is that the pages are quite thin - I end up turning the pages very carefully. The thin pages make for a very compact Bible - only about 1-1/4"" thick including the cover."
4,A good punk album.,"These guys aren't anything super-special, but they are a good, solid band. A few of the lyrics on this album aren't quite up to par, but the music's good and catchy (but without being annoying). Overall, you'll probably enjoy this album, as there's not much you could hate. And that's pretty good when you compare that to other melodic punk bands (Blink 182, Snuff, etc.)"
1,A pointless film,"I got one thing to say about this movie, ""what dyke drama""It has no plot, no color, no intimacy, did I mention NO PLOT!!!!Its a poor excuse of movie making.""Shouldn't dyke movies by law at least have one cute girl?""and my last comment, waste of film, waste of time."
1,Another Narrow and Shallow View of the WORST of Lesbian Life,"WHY oh why do film makers depict lesbians as a community of bad hair, bad clothes, and dead end jobs? OK, yeah, I get it, these people are REAL. But so are women with interesting lives. Show us the successful, functional, socially integrated and ATTRACTIVE women too. How about some intelligent or athletically talented women? There really ARE women like Kay and Professor Bell out there! These characters are WEAK, boring, seem stupid and lifeless. Every aspect of their lives seems troubled, dingy and cheap. The, ""I'm a poor-childishly-dressed-'free spirit'-without-means-to-support-myself-but-that's-COOL-man thing is WAY old. The dead beat life is NOT attractive or respectable in any way. It's someone's idea of how to glorify a meager existance. Unless you need confirmation of a wasted life style, don't waste your time, this movie is terrible."
1,The Worst Of Lesbian Film Making,"In a world where lesbian films are generally non-representative of our community, this goes further to create a dull, meaningless and paranoid world of affected and shallow misfits. No real plot, no one to connect with or care about. The women seem stupid and detached from reality and society. This goes a long way toward setting the public perception of lesbians back into the dark ages. Horrible movie, don't waste your time."
4,a drama but not a drama,"Very well done video the maker has created. It is highly erotic, but with a romantic flaire -- the element that is missing in all the lesbian erotica out there. It's a beautifully and lyrical visual experience in movie."
3,Haven't I read this before?,"Caveat: I haven't read the book.I HAVE reviewed the principles of this diet, however, on the Men's Health website. My initial reaction was that this seems to be a diet plan that was derived from the Oz / Roizen book, ""You: On a Diet"". So much of what this book recommends are the same as those that were outlined in very clear detail by Oz / Roizen, right down to the cheating and the use of nuts as an integral part of the program.I must also add that having ""six-pack abs"" is indeed a function of desirable genetics, and a lack of belly fat. This book should help with the latter, but only providence could help the former. Admittedly, this book promises to help you flatten your belly - now THAT almost everyone can do."
4,fine and dandy,"Item arrived in almost perfect condition. Arrived on the last day of the estimated arrival time, and owner wrote a personal note apologizing for being ""late."" Would do business with them again."
2,Quite simply - it doesn't work.,"This book ""guarantees"" that you will see changes in your body - and in as little as two weeks. Well, it sounds too good to be true and it is. I followed this plan for months and it did nothing. So where do I get my money back?There are some good tips for healthier eating in this book, so if you get most of your meals from a fast-food place this might help you out, but it definitely doesn't produce the results it promises."
4,It's a book for men...and?,"So many complaints from women that this is not really a diet for women. In my experience, there are thousands of books specifically targeting women. I find it quite refreshing that this is a book geared towards men and their weight issues and workout needs. If you go to any bookstore, you will find that almost every ""diet"" book out there is for women. Buy any one of those if you don't like this one."
3,abs diet book,"I have read most of this book. I haven't got to the exercise part yet. I do like it and believe it will lead to even healthier eating and hopefully the loss of fat in the stomach area as stated...at any rate, it is good information and believe that it will probably have the desired affects if followed closely. I guess the main issue I have with the book is that it seems very repetitive and speaks a lot about the reasons the ""other"" diets don't work--which really didn't interest me--I just wanted the info on this diet. I had already dedided not to try the ""other"" diets, for basically the same reasons he mentions. Also, I'm not quite sure if the ""one entree"" dinners are complete dinners or if you can add side dishes or salads, although I believe salads would probably be okay."
4,Women,"I enjoyed reading the book, and recieved very helpful imformation, but it really dose't talk about the female body system and how it will responsed to the diet plan. I read one review from a woman, that was basically areadly in phiscal shape, just needed some help with her stomach area. She gave the book high reviews. I would like to see the book with more women points of view next time. I am looking forwared to finging my Abs again. Thanks for a great book"
4,Great book. Good recipes,"I often refer back to this book every few weeks. I love the smoothie recipies and it also takes you through the pros, cons, and challenges of other diet plans. It also explains that you have to work out your back and other parts of your body in order to sculpt good abs. A good quick read and definitely worth it..."
3,Good for building strength but not so good for losing weight,"This is a review for both the book and the online program. I followed the online program for three months, strictly adhering to the meal plan and exercise schedule. I initially lost ten pounds pretty quickly and then plateaued. I was extremely disappointed that I didn't lose any more weight because I was working so hard. Sure, I got pretty strong. I upped my squats from 185 ten times to 275 six times. And I was benching 250 ten times. But I was still flabby. The adviser recommended that I up the number of circuits but that would mean a lot of additional time in the gym. I was already averaging 1.5 hours as it was.Pros-Whole food menu-Superfoods-You don't go hungryCons-A lot of time in the gym-Too much dairy-A lot of meal prep time-Not enough cardioTo summarize, as with any diet, your results will vary. If you have a fast metabolism, this diet will ignite your fat burning. If you are like me, you will see initial gains and then plateau."
5,Awesome book,The Abs diet changed the way that I look at food. I now eat to feed my body instead of feeding my cravings. I've learned how to eat to burn fat and feed muscle. I am in the best shape of my life and I owe it all to The Abs Diet. The name Abs Diet is really confusing because it is not really a diet. Its a way to eat so you can live a longer happier life. I just wish that I would have found it sooner.Robert E. Bacon
4,Simple enough diet Plan,"I found this book quite easy to read. The 6-week diet plan is not hard to follow. I was looking for a diet plan that complemented my running routine, and I think I found it (I say I think because I am at week 4)So far, the excercise plan is easy to follow, same as the diet plan. I have lost 6 pounds since I started. Most importanly, it spells out what to eat and WHY."
4,Easy for people who don't know how to diet and exercise,"I'm only starting my second week on the plan and its already made a big difference! In just 1 week I've already lost almost a full inch across my waist...and the most important thing is that I'm feeling better and feeling like I look better! The plan is so easy to follow, the book is humorous, the food is good, and the workout is perfect for someone who isn't sure how to get into a regular exercise and healthy eating program. After a week....I don't even need to refer to the book when I go to the supermarket...I already know what I should and should not buy, and what to look for on labels. I recommend it to anyone who is starting out and needs to be pointed in the right direction!"
5,this book really works,"I was one of many that was featured in this book with a success story. I tried it for 6 weeks and it really does work. You never starve, your not as limited to what you can eat like ""atkins or south beach"". the food is good, the recipes are easy. i can't say enough about this. i lost weight and body fat. i still stick with the plan and i have maintained the way i look, feel and weight. Again, this is the way to go."
4,Decent health book,"The book has helped me to clean up my diet, however I haven't really lost much weight on the program so I've also started counting calories a bit. I'm impressed however by the exercise regime set out in the book."
5,Good Advice,I'm a dietetics major and I think this book offers a lot of sound advice about food and exercise. Zinczenko does an excellent job of describing the diseases most related to food choices which is great because people generally don't know why it matters for them to know anything about disease processes.A knowledge of what could happen is the first step in prevention.
5,What did you expect?,"I've read a lot of diet books in the past couple of years...come to think of it, about as long as I've been sitting behind a desk. I bought the ""Abs Diet"" book because it was a very straightforward, honest set of ""rules"" that will lead to great results. The book is a quick and easy read as well as informative and enjoyable.Fad diets, including the low-carb craze, that require you eliminate or go overboard on any one thing are like a 3-legged table with one of the legs missing. The ""Abs Diet"" isn't magic. It's based in eating whole, healthy foods without a lot of crap and follows more of ""everything in moderation"" approach to diet and exercise. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to #1 be healthier, and #2 look better. They offer an online subscription service too that can be quite helpful (although not as user friendly and inexpensive as Calorie King's, it's still pretty good)."
5,I Love This Book!,"I have done the diet and exercise plan for 6 weeks and lost 2 inches on my waist and 2 inches on my hips. I used 5 pound dumbbells for my weight workout. Now I am increasing to 8 pound dumbbells and for cardio I'm going to do running on a treadmill. My perfect body is on the horizon :) This is the best diet and exercise plan ever. I love lifting weights - it's exhilarating. If I'm in a low mood then my joy is restored after the weight workouts (I do 3 circuits of the weights and abs exercises). If I'm in a good mood, then after the workout I'm in a super good mood. I'm so glad I discovered this book and plan to buy also the eat right every time guide and the DVD. This diet and workout plan definitely works for women as well - I am proof. I've read the book 3 times because it's so motivational and is a well-spring of information."
2,too much flab,"There's some good sense in this book, though most of it is borrowed from other places, like the South Beach Diet. But whatever muscle there is is buried under layers of writerly fluff. Readers deserve a little more respect - even readers of diet books."
2,Book can be summed up in 5 pages or less,"The information in this book can be summed up in 5 pages or less. Basically there is a list of foods to base your diet on and they're no big surprise. It is what you would expect to eat. Recipes are basically no-brainers - lots of smoothies and egg dishes. Has some good exercises with pictures which was nice if you don't know what type of exercises you could do to strengthen your abs, but I have an extensive collection of exercises so a lot were duplicates of exercises I already have. I bought the book used, so I got my money's worth. I would suggest getting a copy from your local library before you spend any money buying the book."
4,The Perfect Diet,This diet is so easy to follow! There are plenty of different foods to choose from so it's not restrictive and doesn't get boring. And who doesn't like to eat six times a day? I give it a big thumbs up. It's working for me!
4,Abs Diet,"The word ""diet"" shouldn't even be in the title of this book because it's not really a diet. The book explains what you should be eating the most of and what you should stay away from, but not in a 'diet' sort of way by limiting your daily intake. He basically says to eat all you want of the healthy foods nature has to offer! Great book for those who are frustrated with yo-yo dieting and other eating plans that you cannot keep up with for a lifetime. This one can!!"
2,Kindle Version Has Flaws,"As a diet/lifestyle plan I would give the Abs Diet 4 or 5 stars. Unfortunately, the Kindle version of this book is very hard to use effectively.This weakest point of this book is its organization. The ideas are great, but you have to jump around a lot to reference the workout plans, exercises, diet concepts, recipes, weekly plans, etc... This wouldn't be a problem in a paperback version of a book (and is usually the strength of Kindle books), but this book is extremely slow to load. For some reason the book is in a non-standard font that takes forever to load from page to page. There are numerous useless ""skip to page # for more detail"" notes that have not been linked to the page number, making it impossible for a Kindle user to skip around quickly. Also, the workout section of the book is sloppily formatted for Kindle and has a ton of glitches and blank pages that should have been edited out.Avoid the Kindle version of this book."
3,Slow going,"I just started my fourth week and have only lost about 1 lb per week. I've stuck to the diet, replacing my breakfast and lunch with the ""oatmeal shake"" and I've been walking 3 miles every day. The weight is coming off...just not as fast as I'd like. The thing I liked least about this was ordering from Amazon and expecting the book to arrive within 3 to 5 days as advertised. Three weeks seemed a bit excessive. Aside from that however, the things you can eat are easy enough to live with."
4,Sound advise... too much hype,"In short there's too much fluff and hype in this book where pages upon pages were based on pumping up the reader to finally lose the weight. However, when David actually does get into the concrete information about how and what to eat, it's very sound advise and helped me out a ton. There is another problem with the book in that although David brings out a lot of facts in his hype speech throughout the book, there's zero citations or references of the information. I sincerely doubt he is but what's saying he isn't just fabricating most of the studies he is talking about?"
5,The Abs Diet,"This book, if followed correctly and acurately as David Zinczenko writes, you too will lose weight and get fit. I not only lost 10lbs. in a matter of weeks, but lowered my cholesterol considerably. I'm still at it to this day.Thanks David!"
1,Didn't work for me!,"I followed this plan RELIGIOUSLY for over 8 weeks and I gained 7 pounds, mostly around my belly and face! I bought everything on the shopping list, some items were never even used in the recipies! This book contradicts itself several times about 'eating before working out, or eating after working out', '3 alcoholic drinks per week, or 2 per day', etc, etc. The other thing I found frustrating was the fact that most of the recipes if followed directly (which I thought was the idea!) are for 4 servings, so I found myself eating the same thing a lot, or a ton of leftovers and wasted food.I'm just very disappointed and don't recommend it, but then again, everyone's bodies are different so I hope it works for others!(P.S. a friend of mine tried it and had the same problem.)"
4,Abs Diet book,The book was delivered in a timely manner and was in perfect condition. I would make a purchase again from this seller.
2,NOT for WOMEN,"I did enjoy this book it is very educational. BUT it is not for women to lose weight. They advertise it for women and since ""Abs diet for women"" is not in kindle I got this book. But the meal plans are for men, the morning breakfast one has 400 calories, which is way to many for women.Had to go buy ABS for women to get the correct diet plan."
2,Not for women-only for Americans,This book is not for women and that is bad because nowhere says that this is a book for men. The other thing is that this book refers only to Americans! How about me? I am Greek. Maybe I shouldn't buy this book.
1,I still have a gut and its week seven,"I read, I tryed, I still got a gut. If you did it 8 hours a day for six weeks you could look like the pictures."
1,lousy book--but it does have its uses,"My husband just bought a copy of this ""book."" Thought it was a complete waste of time. I will give it one star, however, because it helped to take the wobble out of our dining room table."
3,middling,"i really wanted to use this book to jumpstart my diet. in fact i did wind up losing 25 pounds in three months, but i can't really give any credit to this book. it ready pretty much like any men's health article. little bit of text, then some anecdotes a little more text and then a recipe for a smoothie.i'd say skip it and do what i did: eat a lot of fiber, minimize calories coming in and work off at least 4-500 calories a day in cardio + weights.oh, and the bast thing you can do: stop 'working out' and start 'training.' find some event you want to do and devote yourself to doing it well.good luck"
4,Diet and Exercise,"Let's keep this simple.Don't buy another diet book.This one has the basics you'll need to become and stay healthy.1)Exercise for 15 minutes twice a day. (Find activities that will raise your heartrate by at least 10% for 900 seconds). A higher heartrate has a positive correlation with calorie burn, which inturn has a positive correlation with a healthy body.2)Before you turn off your alarm down a 60 calorie or less item. (This jump starts your metabolism for the day).2)Eat a balance portion of fats, carbs, and proteins seven to eight times a day.3)Start chugging. As long as you are over 100 pounds drink 1/2 ounce of water for every pound that your fat body carries. If your weight is 120...drink 60 ounces of water a day. If your weights 400 pounds...drink 200 ounces of water a day."
3,Hard to Follow,Bought this with high hopes but found it hard to follow. Takes a lot more discipline than I have.
4,"Good, but not by itself","If I had to form one healthy and manageable diet based on existing diet books, I'd go with ""Volumetrics,"" ""The South Beach Diet,"" and ""The Abs Diet"" combined. South Beach by itself can be a little pricy to follow for some people, but there's plenty of fiber in it and less sugar and sodium. The Abs Diet adds convenience without altering the overall plan of South Beach significantly. In many ways, they're really quite similar. And Volumetrics is a good plan for long-term maintenance."
4,It's a Diet Book!,"I am slightly overweight, 5.8 and 180lbs. I have been working out six days a week to get my body into better shape (not that I am not-actually I am fairly muscular). I have been working on my abs so I went to BN and looked throught this book and read significant parts. So it is a diet book with an emphasis on the abs. Overall, it is a good sensible book but it is still a diet book and diets scare people, at least it scares me. I did learn something that will alter my workout. I was doing more cardiovascular exercises than weight training but I now I am going to devote half the time for eachl. Why? muscles help you loose weight even after you are done working out. If you want a diet book read this one."
3,Good ideas need to be organized,"The author has good overall ideas on weight loss, but needs to organize his program into a step by step method. The book is too hodge podge considering the fact that what he says is not overwhelming."
3,nothing new here,"The abs diet does on bring anything new to those interested in a healthy lifestyle. Eat six times a day, nothing new with that statement. Eat nuts and healthy fats, nothing new here. I find the book to be a collection of common practices you can pick up in any health magazine today. For a healthy and active person I feel this book does not add any new or creative techniques to obtain a better body. I may be bias becouse I have subscribed to health magazines for many years now."
5,Abs Diet Review,"As a marathon runner, and an avid health enthusiast, I cannot recommend this book enough.Not only does this book break down every other diet and why it's unsuccessful (everything from Adkin's to Weight Watchers) it is written in a simple, straight, no-fluff manner.If you read Men's Health Magazine, or Women's Health Mag, this is the book for you.I would highly recommend this if you are looking to modify your diet. It taught me the power foods I should be eating, and the foods that were weighing me down (literally and figuratively).Also, David takes the time to explain health terms that you hear thrown around a ton, but don't know what they really mean ""Trans fatty Acids, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Chlosterol"", etc.In comparison to other health books (ie: Body For Life, etc) this is less sales and more health geared."
3,Great for Beginners....BUT,"This book is a great read for people new to eating right and weight training. It is very easy to follow and to understand.The no measurements, no calorie counting is a strong point of the book as is the basic workout for a weightlifting novice. Having said this, anyone who is familiar with weight training and clean eating(i.e. Eat 6 times a day, plenty of protein,low glycemic carbs, etc.)will not really find anything new. Your better off just buying the issue of Men's health that covers your 12 Power foods and saving yourself the money"
4,Great place to start with raptor identification.,"A good book to start your field and in hand bird identification specialty book shelf.The pictures of birds flying over head are much improved over the paperback Peterson series book ""Hawks"" by Clark and Wheeler."
5,Great for lens cleaning,The E-Wipe cleaning pads seem to have the right amount of cleaning solution. They do a great job of cleaning lenses. I occasionally use them to clean the glass screens of electronic devices. The cleaning pads are great for removing very thin films of oil.
1,to gross for me,"I ,very much enjoyed ""Baked"" it was very funny and the characters were great. This book was to tough for me ,I draw the line, at people eating other people especially if there already overweight."
2,Customer Service non-existent,"These scissors are only good for about a year. After that, the blades will dull and you will not be able to sharpen them because of the curved blade. I went to CulinHome website and sent them a email explaining this, asking what they suggest I do now. I was hoping they would offer a sharpening service, or heck, maybe a discount on a new one... but no response. It's really a shame. I have bought 4 blades and 2 scissors with them in the past, but am not likely to buy from them again.We have to vote with our dollars. Not just to reward good design but also for customer service."
2,A Huge Disappointment,"As a beginning student of mandolin, I've been looking at a lot of instructional materials in addition to taking lessons from a professional musician. Perhaps I'm too far along or my teacher is too formal due to a classical education and playing mandolin,fiddle and guitar but this is one of the worst instructional videos that I've seen so far. Some of the techniques shown in this video will handicap the beginning mandolinist as he or she attempts to develop speed and agility on the fretboard. Also, do yourself a favor and learn to read standard musical notation; you won't regret it later when you learn the instrument and can pick up music written for other instruments and turn it into serious mando-pickin'. I've just started (I do read music) and I've already been able to pick simple versions of some of my favorit tunes!"
5,"if Bruce Lee could play guitar, it would sound like this","I feel like going door to door and telling the whole world about The Hellecasters, they're that good. I'm a hard rock/metal kind of guy, but these guys are crazy. They just rip. Everyone that I've turned on to this has bought their own cd. Enough has been said in the previous reviews, just wanted to add my 2 cents."
4,the sure cure for short attention spans,"This album takes no prisoners as it begins with the country rock of highlander boogie. John jorgenson's bag-o-tricks is surely displayed on this track. ""Peter Gun"" is a feel good cover that is easily picked apart by these three ""steel string surgeons"". The next track... look i could go on and on about each song on the album, but the bottom line is-- If you spend all your time listening to the lyrics of songs dont buy this album. But, if you live for the lead ride this album is for you. These guys are masters of their crafts. If you love the guitar and all of its possibilities, then, The Return Of The Hellecasters should be in your collection"
5,Awesome TV for Standard Definintion viewing,The truth is most people still watch SD programming on their HDTVs. I wanted a TV that would give good SD quality and I think this one gives outstanding quality. I have Dish Network International programming (that won't be going HD any time soon) and the channels look great on this TV. Highly recommended.
5,"what a deal, what a TV!","I got this TV while it was on sale for the HOlidays, and it's about time I upgraded to HD, being a filmmaker I can pick out image flaw and whatnot pretty easily, and this thing produces an amazing image for the dollar. The only thing is, burn in scares me a bit, as alot of the movies I watch are in the 2:35:1 aspect ratio, and have noticed the bars will burn in for a half hour or so, but just watching full screen for a bit will get rid of it, I'd be wary of a plasma if you're gonna be gaming alot. But overall, the contrast is great, it gets solid blacks, and I'm happy, and you should be too if you get it."
5,AwEsOmE value,I researched and researched and..... settled for this plasma. AWESOME. I am COMPLETELY satisfied. No need to repeat what others have already said.
5,Wow...nice picture!,I am very pleased with this purchase. The picture is great and the price was just too good to pass up.
5,Great TV for a great price!,"I was set on getting a Samsung DLP for the longest time until I came across this TV and all the great reviews for it. I then switched over to plasma and I couldn't be happier with this TV and my choice. I have had it for about 3 months now or so and it is still as stunning as it was before.My Sony upconverting DVD player workes great with this TV and utilizes one of the two HDMI ports provided on this TV. xBox 360 looks great as well. HD cable is my favorite part of this TV and the improvement over regular cable is unbelievable!The speakers aren't as loud as I would like but I plan on getting a theatre system soon to give me that ""surround sound feel."""
5,"Panasonic 42"" Plasma","This TV is awesome. The picture is sharp and lives up to it's Consumer Reports Best Buy pick. It has plenty of inputs, TV menu's are easy to figure out, sound is ok, but you will probably want to hook it up to a surround sound system anyway."
3,Bad Motion Blur,"Let me first state that I hate LCD TV's. The motion blur kills me. That is the reason I chose to buy the Panasonic Plasma. From all the research I did, I kept hearing how Plasmas do not suffer from motion blur.This TV has some of the worst motion blur I have seen. Watching sports or playing video games on this TV is not possible. I am not sure if all Plasmas have motion blur, but I can tell you for a fact this one does. This has nothing to do with the ""clay face"" issue this model is known for. With the proper settings, this can be removed completely. But no amount of tweaking fixes the motion blur problem.If this TV will not be used for sports or video games, then I would recommend it. Non sports HD content and movies look stunning. I am hoping the motion blur issue is only related to this model. I will probably return it and get the Panasonic 42px75u. Thanks.Jeff"
2,I wish I had bought an LCD TV,"When I first received the TV I was happy, it looked good and it served its purpose. But, I have only had the TV for 3 weeks and I already have image burn in. I only watch the TV 2 hours a night and I have done what I could to avoid burn in, but it happened anyway. The black bars at the top and bottom of the TV are already burned in and network logos in the bottom right hand corner are burned in too. If I could return this TV I would and buy an LCD TV instead."
3,picture is good BUT,"before i begin, please excuse my naiveness as i am a newbie when it comes to plasmas....i got this about a week ago and noticed that i get shadow images..its not that bad but when words or whatever come up i can totally tell the shadows...is this normal? and yes...i did calibrate it..."
1,Check TV on Delivery !,"1 star is for delivery not for TV.Just got TV via Eagle USA.....opened box, which looked in perfect condition and the TV at 2 large cracks in it. Repacked and ready for pick-up.Unpack before delivery guy leaves !"
4,TH-42PX60U,"The set has a good picture, but was not the model I wanted. By mistake, I ordered the set, thinking I had ordered the TH-42PX600U model, which has more features, including a cable card slot. I do not like having to use a tuner box to see HD. The set occasionally shows nonfunctioning pixels at the top, but I cannot determine if those are due to source material or the set. Since I thought I was buying the higher grade model, the price I paid seemed reasonable. It was actually high, since it was for the bare bones model. I had already found numerous sources for the TH-42PX60U at considerably lower prices. After buying (the error was entirely mine) I suffered buyer's regret."
4,Panasonic TH-42PX60U,"I also had reservations about ordering a ""big"" TV on-line, but had no problems (yet) with Amazon or the White Glove service. Took about 12 days for the TV to arrive at my doorstep and the movers placed the TV in the room of my choosing. They also unpacked the box so I could inspect the TV for any potential damage. TV works great. Not a big fan or adjusting the aspect ratio every time I change a channel and sometimes the picture doesn't fit on the screen but other than that I'm very happy with my TV. My only $.02, it was not clear that the number you submit on your order form is the number that the moving service will use to schedule an appointment to deliver your TV."
4,The Best HDTV For the BUCK,"The Best Bang for the Buck, I went to Best Buy Picked this up for 1299.99Looks great tested it with Finding Nemo because of the colors and sharpness looks incredible. HD TV is even more of a in your face great looking thing. One thing many people who review this TV dont mention is, with the Xbox 360 playing games is clear as it gets beatiful looking gamesIf I had any complaints it would be the Resolution could have been a little higher and being that its a newer model 1080i native would be been even better. Dont let that fool you, this TV Set in a final word is AMAZING!!!"
5,Great for the money!!!,"This TV has everything you need to get HDTV. There are some other features that you could get on a pricier model but this model offers the best picture available on almost any HDTV, albeit with a basic feature-set.Follow the setting posted by the last user but you may want to keep it toned down for a while until you break it in (100-200 Hours). I only offer that as a precaution to protect the investment, I have no first-hand experience with burn-in that they say is hypothetically possible if you leave the same image on for an extended period of time.Shop for price, this one is advertised alot."
4,"Nice TV, but shame on Amazon","Was really excited to place an order for this TV for $1279 on Monday 11/27. Amazon said tv was on backorder until the 30th. No big deal. On 11/30 I received an email saying that Amazon is having problems with their supplier, and my tv wouldn't be shipped for weeks, and would arrive between 12/21 and 1/9. Yet this tv is still shown to be in stock by Amazon by December 4th. If you check this item daily, you will notice that the in stock date keeps getting pushed back every day. Don't plan on getting this into your home by Christmas from Amazon."
5,Excellent Buy,"I saw this Plasma unit and a similar sized LCD unit from VIZIO at a members only store, playing the ICE Age movie, and I can easily say that the Plasma's display quality was way above the LCD. The viewing angle was great on the Plasma. The next thing I know, I was getting an orange flat cart, and hurtling down the cash register with the Panasonic plasma and brought it home.I connected it to my computer via Component cables, use 720p to play dvd movies. The experience is nothing short of Awesome. The clarity is unmatched by LCDs.. seriously.. it's scintillating.Also my digital photographs stand out when i watch it on the plasma.Overall an excellent bang for the buck... Absolutely pleased, and highly recommended."
4,I CALLED Panasonic to confirm Resolution,"I just called Panasonic.1-800-211-7562I asked them about the confusion if this Plasma can actually ""DISPLAY"" 1080 or not.Answer: This tv will ACCEPT a 1080 resolution, but will down convert it to DISPLAY in 720p format. This tv only displays a 720p resolution.Side Note: I asked whats the ""real"" difference? He said, if you sit any farther than 5ft from the tv, you'll notice the 1080 will be a bit sharper. Other than that, the TV will look identical. (Thats why the 720's looks basically the same at BestBuy... You're standing SO close) lol"
4,Great little stool,"This is a very basic, small stool. Folds extremely compact. I am not sure I would trust it for sitting for long periods/if you weigh more than 150, but it is perfect as a very portable footstool after a long day of hiking."
3,"Not Strong, yet not weak...","Wilshire's debut album is not a total let down, but is in no way a breakthrough in Christian music. Perhaps the best thing about this project is the lyrics. The words to the songs are both powerful and thoughtful, but most of the tunes just don't let this record live up to its potential. Take my advice, and buy it if you can a low sale price."
2,Very Talented Group... Subpar Album,"Far and away the best song by Wilshire is ""Special."" I bought this album expecting something in that vein, and there simply wasn't anything. That's not to say that this album isn't pleasant (or even good occasionally)... but there's just nothing ""Special"" on here."
3,PRETTY GOOD!,"I saw this great duo in concert with Smitty in the fall. Their concert was really very good. Their cd is good too, but a little weake. They have GREAT harmonies, GREAT lyricks, I guess they are just a tad too soft for my taste, but other than that they are GREAT!"
4,This couple is reason for Smitty forming Rocketown Records,"This debut album from a very talented duo grew on me the more i spun it. They can sing, write, and play. Not too many ""packaged"" artists can, or do, in the CCM world. It falls between pop and rock. There's plenty of original guitar jammin' to please the rocker and plenty pop melodies and vocals to please the ""sing-a-long"" types. The brown-ish album cover doesn't do them any justice on what's inside. Like the saying goes, ""Dont judge it buy it's cover!"" Also, check 'em out on tour with Michael W Smith - Fall '98 as opener and backup band members."
2,Cheap Stuff,"The handles are nice, the best thing about these very cheap screwdrivers. The 'oxide tip' is a some kind of painted on coating that scratches off very easily. Don't be fooled by the appearance of a real professional screwdriver. These aint it."
1,magnectic screwdrivers..,I bought this item and returned it. It was supposed to be magnectic and they did work. I would not recommend these unless you just want a good price set of screwdrivers..
5,Lollia breathe no 19,The product arrived just in time for my daughter's birthday. She loved it. The look on her face was priceless. She had seen it in a store in her travels and lamented not buying it then. Perfect gift. Smells heavenly.
2,Don't bother...,"This movie was not named American Psycho 2 until the very end, it had a complete different title. Then the studios thought it would fit in with the orginal American Psycho, so they added a few scenes to make it look like a sequel...But believe me, it is not.I wasnt pleased with this movie at all. The orginal was a true dark classic. This wasnt. ...BR>All in all, don't bother with this movie, unless your a guy and just wanna see that hott girl from ""that '70s show"" in some tight shirts! :D"
1,Offensive garbage,"This is the worst movie ever, I cant believe that this movie was made. Very dissapointing. Hopefully everyone who was involved with the production of ""american psycho 2"" will never make another film again after this disaster. Do your self a favor and buy the ""sickening conceptions"" special edition DVD instead."
1,Disgrace to the original.,"I might have given this movie 2 stars, except that just having the same name as the first movie is a slap in the face to fans everywhere. This movie is horrible. If it wasnt for the name, this movie would have been long forgotten."
2,"Below average, but watchable","The kills, the plot, and the direction are all predictable, but it still has a bit of charm. I think the music helps a lot and ties scenes together. Shatner is enjoyable also. However, The commentary by Mila Kunis is absolutely horrible. She acts like a 12 year old spoiled brat and it is painful to listen to. This is definitely a rental and not for purchase."
2,Wow.,"I don't mean 'Wow.' as a compliment. It's rare that a movie comes out that is so bad that it makes you laugh. ""Horror"" movies are not supposed to make you laugh, but this one will because it's so over-the-top cheesy and badly written that you can't help it. Plus, William Shatner has almost become a cartoon character so you can't help but laugh at his part in the movie. Not since ""Showgirls"" has a movie been made that is this bad.The only redeeming value of this movie is that it is nearly two hours of the ever cute Mila Kunis (That 70's Show). Anything with her in it for two hours can't have one star...thus the extra star.If it's late at night and there is absolutely nothing else to watch on television, do yourself a favor and turn off the TV, and sit in the corner and twittle your thumbs or something. It'll be more productive!"
1,Why? Why? Why?,"American Psycho was a masterpiece. Christian Bale gave an incredible performance as Patrick Bateman. And this makes American Psycho II even worse by comparison. It was rather unfortunate to have to say that the best performance was given by William Shatner. (Who is supposed to play a college professor playboy.) And Mila Kunis' character is just improbable to say the least. Will someone explain to me how a such a small person can impale a full grown man with a broom handle? Some of the death scenes are intended to come off as amusing, but just end up annoying and predicted. An acceptable movie for those who want a rental to laugh at on a boring night, but by no means expect the genius of the original."
1,American Psycho 2,"THIS FILM IS AN ABOMINATION!!! If you have any respect for the work of Bret Easton Ellis, Mary Harron, or Christian Bale, you will not subject yourself to this filth. Everything that was exciting, funny and intriguing about the first film is gone. I want everyone who loved the amazing first film or the great book to consider this film a personal insult. Any and every trace of the social commentary and significance of American Psycho has been wiped clean away. What we are left with is a straight slasher flick, and a poor one at that. I only wish that there was a rating lower than 1 star. I wish there were ratings in the deep negatives. i wish i could give this film a rating that reflected the 88 minutes it stole from my life. This film is a defamation of the Title ""American Psycho."" Erase it from your memory. Deny its very existence."
2,Train Wreck Of A Movie.... {2 Stars},"I can't really add much to the reviews. I mean, 76 reviews and a 2 star average. I think that speaks for itself. I only sat through this tripe because I think Mila Kunis is incredibly hot. Even that wasn't enough to keep me from trading it in for store credit. I gave it 2 stars for having Mila in it, but it's really a 1 star release.Avoid avoid avoid."
1,THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE BANNED PERIOD!,"No, I didn't see this film from beginning to end, but anyone who stick a cat in the microwave should be killed with extreme prejudice. Killing animals like that shouldn't be tolerated and they should be reported to the Humane Society without haste. I realize that this is just a movie, but there are other ways to show someone (both visually and through Dramatic Writing) is pyshco without killing innocent animals."
1,That is Blatantly Cruel To Animals!!!,"I saw only five seconds of this film and I want to throw up. What kind of ... would shoot, write, and/or even produce a film with a cat exploding in a microwave? That is just blatantly cruel to animals. Humans' being murdered is one thing, they can at least defend themselves. Everyone involved in this production should take a good hard look at the mirror and be ashamed of themselves. Next, they should look at what Alfred Hitchcook did in his films. They all at least had some style and they scared the pants off you. I realize that this is just a film, but blatant curelty to animals is not cool and should not be shown in any meduim whatsoever!!!"
2,Standrad direct to DVD filler,American Psycho 2 is your standard direct to video film. The film really isn't anything to write home about. I mean Mila Kunis gives an okay performace( although she could have showed some T& A). William Shatner gives an timid performance as a teacher deep dishin his students and everyone else is pretty much no name. The film does have some one-liners but that is it
2,Nowhere near the original...,"This movie was a major dud. I was so hyped to see this movie, when I saw it I just shook my head. It has nothing to do with the first 'American Psycho' movie except for the beginning when Patrick Bateman was killed by Mila Kunis. It just made no sense, had no real plot and the casting was horrible.'American Psycho II' is about a girl (Mila Kunis) who enters school to become an FBI agent. During the movie, she decides she wants to be a teacher's assistant. As luck would have it, she has other people in competition with her for the position, so she begins to kill them off."
4,I know it's not as serious as American Psycho,"I see a lot of complaints about this movie not being a proper sequel to American Psycho, and I believe the connection is what hurts it unfortionately. This is a very funny dark comedy, Mila Kunis is great, and William Shatner eats scenery like he does whenever he acts. If you haven't scene either film, watch this one first, you might enjoy it more. Don't miss the first one either, it is a masterpiece."
2,Well.... At least Mila Kunis is hot in this.,"I like the original American Psycho until late one night I saw that they had a sequel to it so I gave it a shot a my thought are without a doubt nowhere in a league with AP. The plot and story line is lame and predictable. the only true acting skills come from Bill Shatner and the ending is predictable. Mila Kunis was great in Family Guy (voice of Meg) but in this she looks like she's is rehersing for ""Heathers 2"""
3,"Hey now, it wasn't THAT bad","I thought the movie was cute! No, it wasn't Oscar material and it was never meant to be. However, it did make for an entertaining watch. It was never meant to follow the original. There are MANY different types of psychotics out there, why just stick with some boring old guy that everyone has seen before. I liked it!"
2,Nope; no satire here,"Understand something right away: There is absolutely no correlation betwen AP 1 and AP2 except the name. None, zippo, nada. The first was a game attempt at capturing the book (a satiric masterpeice, BTW. You should read it) and was an effective, if not great, satire. This is not a satire; more like a documentary on how to make a bad slasher movie. It has a number of unintentional genuine laughs, and you can tell Shatner really thought he was doing well here, which is sad, but also amusing unto itself. But nobody in this film is ever gonna be nominated for a Herman or Ignatz, much less an Oscar. It's just completely staggering how far this film missed the point. Not just by miles, but light years. Mikee, another reviewer, says it perfectly, so I won't add anything. If you find it for $5 or under, it might be worth owning, just as you'd buy Ed Wood. If not, rent it and forget it."
2,No Good,"Well its a stupid movie with a stupid plot, but Mila Kunis is quite good, I dig her a lot. Someone should put her in a real movie and see how she handles it."
1,Not even related to American Psycho,"Do not buy if you are thinking that this movie is even related to American Psycho. This is a terrible attempt to try and continue the Bateman legacy. It is terrible, i would not waste money on it. It would have been an average film had it been under a seperate title. This was terrible."
4,"Great Movie, depending on what you are looking for","If you're looking for a movie just like American Psycho the original, you will probably be disappointed. The movie would probably be better appreciated if the movie had a completely different name.I can understand the poor reviews and low ratings because these people were expecting a Horror movie. This is NOT one. That doesn't make it a bad movie though.This movie is MEANT to be be funny sort of like the ""Scream"" series. The humor and twists and turns are VERY clever. You'll probably be surprised by a couple things by the end. Mila Kunis is very believable in this role.The goofiness of William Shatner as the professor is intended and adds to the film."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!,"This movie deserves 0 stars.I've read the book and watched American Psycho.THIS MOVIE IS A DISGRACE TO PATRICK BATEMAN!Reasons NOT to see this movie:1) The entire plot is predictable within the first 10 minutes.2) Barely any Gore, little blood, not a horror movie.3) It has a ""cute"" ending.4) Mila doesn't get naked, no nudity whatsoever.Save your money for the book ""American Psycho"" by Bret Easton Ellis."
3,Mila Kunis,"I just bought it to see Mila Kunis. Not a great movie, not a horrible move but a Beautiful girl."
1,I only finished it because of Mila!,"Ohh my god - worse movie ever made or at least one of them.This is really a comedy with a poor plot.If you rent it, be sure to get it free or something because not even the $4 are worth it.P.S. Mila looks hot killing people, thats the reason the movie gets a star."
1,Just not that great,"does anyone know if this even came out in theatres??? I don't remember hearing anything about this, and I'm surprised Christian Bale (If he reprised his role as Patrick Bateman at all here) would have agreed to do a movie that most people seem to find so terrible."
1,The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,"I wouldn't even give this move 1 star.I give it no stars.It is an insult to any movie.It shouldn't even be called American Psycho 2 because it really doesn't have anything to do with American Psycho.It is just one of those stupid killer movies.And believe me,that does not give anything away.If you see this movie,which I don't think anyone should,you will see what I am talking about.I do recommend American Psycho though.Christian Bale's performance in the movie is outstanding.Definately oscar worthy."
2,It's fun as a comedy,"I watched this movie as a joke. The first movie was okay but that's comparing it with the book. This ""sequel"" (only by name) is meant to be a satire I think but it came off as a joke to me. I laughed at it and actually was entertained by how bad it really was. It's a badly made movie by a director who obviously did it for the paycheck (we hope) but I couldn't help laughing and getting a kick out of this movie. This movie will definitely have an audience and a cult following (a small one but large enough to be classified as a cult following) but for most people, it will be horrible. Just take it as a comedy and you might actually enjoy it. Then again....you could make some sort of drinking game out of this movie I bet lol."
3,I'm sorry everyone but I liked this film,It's stupid ... and fun to watch.The only problem I had with it was what...was Captian Kirk doing in this film.The only reason I wanted to see this film is the fact I'm a huge Forever Knight fan.I did not like the first movie at all but I loved the book....
3,Much better than the first!,"The first one was just aweful. So I didn't think much of this sequel, but surprisingly it really went well. It worked, and there is some suspense in this movie. The fact that the psychopath is now a young college girl, was also a nice twist to the story. Good for what it is, a nice psycho-thriller."
2,Not functional,"I bought this because I have a very modern living room..however, the telescopic feature is ridiculous unless you are 6 ft tall and want to see eye to eye with it. I wish it would actually shrink lower so you could use it in more than just a floor option. Also, it rusts really easy. My kid dripped some water on the base and it rusted fast. Not what I would expect for the price I paid. The mirror also broke when my kid grabbed the face and turned to look in the mirror. He is a very gentle sensitive boy and I was present so I dont understand why this happened, Im just lucky it didnt injure him. This ended up at the Garbage dump. $90 bucks wasted.:("
5,You Won't Be Sorry,"You will be so glad that you listen to this CD. You will laugh, cry and laugh again. It's something the whole family will enjoy."
5,Totally Funny,I am from the North Carolina area. I first heard Chonda on TNN. While living in Georgia I had the opportunity to meet her in person. This CD is totally funny. I listen to it at least twice a week.
5,A WONDERFUL Christian comedian!!!!,"I have Chonda's first album, ""Second Row, Piano Side"" and absolutly loved it!!! I can relate so well, as I was raised along the same lines and pulled some similar acts in my life!!! Her 2nd album ""Having a Girls Night Out"" is also a wonderful testimony of her life!! I would recommend it very highly for a good laugh and maybe even a tear!"
3,"Half-entertaining, half headache","""Night of the Demon"" could've been a rough gem, but too many parts of it are either boring, confusing, or fail to deliver the bigfoot goods. The first half gave me hope, because it's fun. A group of researchers interupt a funny sacrifice to the bigfoot gods, bigfoot kills people (all in flashback mode) in funny ways, but after awhile, the movie loses steam, especially considering a lot of the kill scenes at the end are done in slow-motion and the gore factor really isn't a factor.But I can't hate this movie, but I can't give it a huge thumbs up either. I wanted to like it more, but I couldn't...though it did have its moments."
2,"Gore, And Nothing More","Night of the Demon is a pretty bad Bigfoot movie that I expected to be fun. But it's mostly dull. There are some gory death scenes, particularly in the third act, but a lot of them are done in slow motion and look stupid. Bigfoot also has a smooth chest, so apparantly he's metrosexual. And the woman who gave birth to Bigfoot's child (?) got on my nerves with her incoherant babbling. Unless you're a Bigfoot completist, there's really no need for you to buy this."
1,code red in serious trouble?,"Besides this title available from Amazon marketplace sellers only as of release date, all the new code red titles have an introduction from a diva from 2008. I guess she couldnt find work in this economy so she is working for pennies trying to be cute! The big question is why is code red doing this? Is she the wanna be Elvira of 2011? Besides not even being born when these movies came out ,the owners of code red have not even given her a good script as to any trivia about the movie you will be watching! So maybe you will also find her creepy like I do and not even in a good way.Hopefully in the future we will see less of her like Jar Jar Binks in the Star Wars movies. AT first cute,then annoying and then you wish you never even seen that character at all!"
5,Great Movie,I have always been a big fan of this movie. It is very hard to find. I was surprised when I found it on Amazon for as cheap as I did. A great price for a great movie.
3,Serious Eating Disorders,I liked this film. The seriousness of the theme is a crucial event in our time and I believe it gives plenty of information for those going through the same thing.
4,"Good info, some gaps.","This book has some really great pieces of information and I have shared it happily with my barn-mates. The author is somewhat brief in spots, and I finished it feeling like there were gaps in my knowledge that I needed to get other books to fill. I understand that everything about endurance riding cannot be covered in one tome, but I wish she had shared more of her obviously large bank of knowledge. Good ideas and great perspectives are sometimes hidden in sections where they don't belong, so read carefully."
3,Not what I was expecting,"If you are ready to enter an endurance competition, this book will be a very good tool to you, so that you'll know what to expect and what to take. If you are planning on start doing endurance with your horse and aren't sure of how to condition your horse, than this book isn't going to be the tool for that. I think that the writer should talk more about a training plan and on how to get a horse ready for his first competition."
3,Very strong for baby soap.,I like these soaps but even the baby is not mild. It stings in more intimate places whereas other natural soaps don't. I still buy it ocassinaly but use it more for hand washing. Their mild is pretty strong which was very disappointing. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it's organic and unscented.
5,Family Favorite for 15 Years,"Dr. Bronner's is the best bar soap around. It really is as ""baby-mild"" as the name suggests. My family has been using it for 15 years and we would never use anything else."
4,Great....loved it....but wished it had more....,"I read this entire book in like 2 hours...lolSeriously, I couldn't put it down. I'm not much of a writer, so let me give you my ""likes/dislikes""likes:1)Finally a book on how to BUILD a computer...and I don't mean slapping pre-made video cards, etc together.2) Apple I was a simple computer. So, this book does a good job explaining how it works. Down to the chip level.3) Bonus chapter on ""hacking the macintosh"" which shows some mods of a Mac SE.Dislikes:1) Was too short.2) I wished it would have covered how to get the ROM into the Apple for us who haven't ordered the kit. Basically, if you don't have the EPROM chip with the original Apple ROM, you can't assemble your own replica. If you have access to the rom image and an EPROM burner, then you should be able to use this book and the software to build it. Or, buy the kit.Overall, I still loved the book. I really hope there is enough interest to create another.-cbmeeks"
5,Good but out-dated,"This is a good guide to the first stories, but with No. XIII about to come out it badly needs updating. New characters have emerged, as have new authors, and this fascinating series has developed many new twists and turns. Come on, Marquand, give us a new edition! Some reviewers have complained this book is too short - well, there is a heap of new material to add to it."
4,Great replacement product,"My daughter lost her charger for her camera, so we bought this replacement, and it works great. The charger comes with a fairly long electrical cord, so don't worry about buying the cord separately."
4,Nikon Battery Charger,"Came in a few days sooner than expected. Packaged well. Good condition, looked brand new even though it was listed as a ""used"" item. Works exactly as expected. Definite thumbs up"
5,Wonderful.,After moving I lost the charger to my camera and after months I finally decided to order a new one. I knew I wanted to purchase a Nikon product as I don't trust those third party items and I was surprised to find it at such a reasonable price. This product it perfect! It does come with the cord to plug into the wall so you don't need to order that separate. It does exactly what my original charger did. It did take some time to ship but it arrived on time.
3,Nikon has pissed me off as my cool px s3000 did not come with a battery charger,instead they had it usb power adapter to charge it in the cameria but it never worked and after sending it back to nikon twice they never fixed ust rechareged the battery and sent it back both times so I will never buy another nikon and my new point and shoot is a cannon 3400/is
1,Does Not Work,I have tried twice to charge my Nikon battery with this charger. It does not work.Too lazy to send it back.
5,Nikon Charger Performs Well!,"Product works great! Received used camera as a gift, and only needed the charger to be in business. Decided I didn't need a new one...used product performs perfectly! Vendor sent it very promptly...."
5,good,The product works very well. I'm just happy i finally have a battery charger for my camera and I can take pictures again! yay
1,Test it out ASAP!,"Ordered the charger several months ago and only recently had an occasion to use the camera (my college graduation). Lo and behold, the unit was defective! Make sure you test it out within 30 days, as that is how long their ""warranty"" is. What happened to the standard 1-year warranty? Oh well looks like I'll have to order another!"
5,Great Charger,"This charger is a great deal. I found a off-brand 'multi' charger at a local store that was cheaply made and twice the price. I'm so glad I found this one. Nikon makes a quality product. As other reviewers have said (Thank You!) this one comes with a power cord as well, although it is not shown in the picture. Don't hesitate to purchase, it ships quickly and you'll have an original Nikon charger again."
4,Nikon Camera Charger,I got the item and now can charge my camera. The listing did not show that it came with the power cord so I ordered one separately. Overall happy with the purchase.
5,Works perfectly!!,I wasn't sure if I was ordering the right item but this is exactly what I needed. Took the battery pack out of my camera and put it in the charger....worked great!!
4,Just what I ordered.....,I ordered a Nikon Mh-63 Battery Charger for my camera. I lost this important part of my camera on vacation. I was surpise to find it on Amazon.Com at a good price. I order it.. and it was delivered in 5 days. It was what I ordered and I got what I ordered...
4,Battery Charger,Product worked great and arrived at my door in a few days and was much cheaper than buying a new battery or camera
4,"Works great, but . . .","This is a great charger, and is almost exactly like the one I lost/ was stolen from me, but is not quite in as good condition as was advertised. I got it a while ago, and have been meaning to write a review for a while, so here it is. When you get a charger like this, you can pretty much rest assured you're doing the right thing, because it's the same basic charger as came with the cordless drill, not a knock-off piece of junk some one is trying to pawn off as a suitable substitute! Most of you reading this probably know what I'm talking about.I have had this one for a while and it's still working very well, if not better! :) Honestly, you cannot go wrong with a Dewalt. I have been a professional carpenter/electricion for most of the better part of twenty years, and I personally swear by DeWalt. Wilwalkie products are good, but I use Dewalt across the board, just cuz! :o)"
3,Didn't come with manual,"It didn't come with a manual and it said it had tuneup mode, but it didn't, it was just a regular charger. Still a good deal for a plain charger."
2,It works but,"This unit works fine(as advertised), BUT; If I would thought for a moment I would havew waited for their charger that works with the lithium ion batteries also. Now I still have to purchase that unit."
3,Where is the Button?,You advertise a tune up mode on your DW9116 Dewalt charger. I see the button on the picture of the charger I was suppose to get. But when I opened the package...I see the yellow label for the tune up mode but no Button. Does the charger tune up automatically without the button or is this a classic case of false advertisment? Please fill me in on this one...
5,Excellent Product,"Charges Black and Decker PS140 14.4 Volt Firestorm batteries. Much better than the stock Black and Decker charger as the tune-up feature of the DeWalt charger breathes new life into old batteries. Plus, the 1 Hour quick charge time is an outstanding feature."
2,Seems very temperature sensitive,"I have found that on about an 80 degree day, charging will never start unless the battery and charger are put in a shady spot for quite a while. Has anyone else had that problem? Not good for many job sites. I will follow up with DeWalt in case it's a malfunction."
4,DeWalt/B&D 14.4 Charger,"This charger replaced my blown B&D; charger that came with my Fire Storm tools. What a great deal ($20 including shipping).Was able to charge batteries that are at least 3 years old!!Helpful LED indicator re: battery status...quick charge; 1 hour.No manual, but other than that a GREAT DEAL!!!"
4,Good transaction,"The purchase of the charger went well and the charger came wtih instructions, and the packaging was complete..better than the previous purchase of the same item last year. Continue Improvements!!! The dewalt charger beats the Black and Decker original equipment by leaps and bounds."
1,Roll of the dice-----I lost!!,"Saw in some review that this DeWalt battery charger could be used to recharge Black and Decker batteries in my drill. Trouble was that both batteries ""died""and very costly to replace. For a few dollars more, can purchase whole thing but will never spend another penny on Black and Decker item.IMPORTANT---I cannot rate this item as I could not recharge my batteries. It is probably a very good charger."
2,this one is out in my book,I bought two of these here about six months ago and today a firestorm battery killed both of them. I did buy another from a co worker today but beware of this one.
3,Dewalt DW9116 7.2 -18 Volt 1 Hr. Battery Charger,"DEWALT DW9116 7.2-Volt to 18-Volt Pod Style 1 Hour Battery ChargerBought two of these at one time. Works great as they are supossed to but I noticed on thing after starting to use for the first time, the little yellow refurbish button is nowhere to be found, it's in the photo but not on the units I received. But in the end, I wanted the charger to recharge my 12 volt batteries, and they do that just fine."
5,Just what I wanted,I ordered this item to replace one that was zapped by lightning. It is exactly what I wanted and needed at a price that was unbelievable!
4,It tunes them up,"Replaced my old charger with this one. Made a big difference with my older batteries that would not take much of a charge. Gave some new life to them. If you are a user of cordless tools, you know that batteries are the big maintenance expense. While my figures are not scientifically valid, my best guess is that this charger will extend the life of the batteries at least 20 percent"
5,DW9116 included with DC970K-2,"Like many others, my Black & Decker PS160 charger died. While some reviewers of the B&D PS1MVC charger say not to charge a B&D battery in a DeWalt charger, many more reviewers of the DeWalt DW9116 say they have charged their B&D batteries in a DeWalt charger with no problems. I was about to buy the DW9116 charger for about $40, when I noticed Home Depot is selling the DeWalt DC970K-2 drill kit for $99, which includes the DW9116 charger. So, for an extra $60, I got an extra 18V drill (an upgrade from my 12V B&D drill), two batteries, and case. I can use the DW9116 charger for the two B&D batteries and the two DeWalt batteries. The DW9116 is very fast, charged my B&D 12V PS130 batteries in 30 minutes without problem."
3,Worked As Promised,"I brought this charger to replace a dead one for a 9.6-V DeWALT power drill. The dead charger came with the drill set that was only used occasionally. I was surprised when it started smoking. Very disappointed from a reputable company as DeWALT. I wanted a higher voltage charger in case I get other DeWALT tools that use 18-V. I shopped around the big box store and found this one at Amazon to be the best deal.Pro - Charges up the 9.6V batteries quickly, no nasty plastic shipping container to deal with, easy to operate, so far so good.Con - Shipped in a plastic bag. Although the charger might be new but it sure makes me think ""refurbished"". So I guess it's both a pro and a con."
1,DEWALT DW9116 7.2-Volt to 18-Volt Pod Style 1 Hour Battery Charger,"This product arrived with no packaging at all, it was just thrown into a bag. It appeared as if it was bought at a garage sale, with scratches and had that ""used"" look. It obviously was not brand new, if at most it may have been refurbished, due to the lack of packaging. I was seriously disappointed in this merchant and must warn you that if you purchase from here, you may not get a brand new packaged product! Beware please, and be careful what you purchase because sometimes the description reads it is new, when it is not. I hope this helps."
5,Works as intended,This works as it is intended. I like how it conditions the battery as well. My battery holds a charge for months. I love dewalt products! get a whole set as a christmas present you will not be disappointed.
5,Great charger!,"I was happy to find out that this charger would charge my Black and Decker battery and, in fact, it charges it much better than the original charger that came with my drill.I am extremely happy with this and I would recommend this to anyone. It's a great deal."
4,battery charger,the unit I purchased showed a manual tune-up mode button. the unit I recieved has an automatic tune-up mode system. I do not know how that works. the charger works fine and the price was good.
5,GREAT VALUE,WHAT A GREAT PRICE AND IT WORKS GREAT....WOULD BUY IT AGAINTHANKS FOR THE GREAT FIND.......
5,Worth the price,"Lent my DeWalt to my brother who lost the charger. Went to **** and they wanted to charge $110 at the store. Searched Amazon and found this one. Looks, feels, and does the same thing, and in fact, brother can't even tell that it's a new charger.This is just the charger though. Nothing else, including the instruction, comes with it."
3,Not a direct replacement,"The charger this one replaced had a 'battery optimizer' feature that helped to restore older batteries. Dewalt recommended to use this after 10 recharges. I took the number off of the old one and found this unit. It has the same Dewalt part number and even has the spot where the optimizer should be......but it isn't there!Unit charges fine, just thought I'd get the exact unit I had."
5,Replacement for Black & Decker charger,"Top of the line product. This product comes highly recommended. It cost $70.00 at Lowes plus tax. I got it for $25.00 total price. I burnt up two original chargers for my Black & Decker cordless drills, Firestorm. This charger will handle all B & D batteries as well as Dewalt."
5,Works for 18v Black & Decker Firestorm too!,"I can verify that this charger will bring back to life the 18v version of a Black & Decker Firestorm battery too! It brought mine back to life after needlessly buying a new battery.This is really significant for us 18v owners because Black & Decker does make a ""kill proof"" charger that reconditions batteries but it is not available for the 18v version! So this is your only prayer of giving your batteries new life. That's certainly better than messing up the environment by (1) throwing away a battery that can be rejuvenated and (b) causing someone in the world to have to manufacture a replacement.My dead battery was manufactured in 2000, so it was old but not ancient. I only use it once a month, so I would guess there is more life in it!"
4,DeWalt DW9116 7.2-Volt to 18-Volt Pod Style 1 Hour Battery Charger,Great product. Please note that they recalled an earlier model due to fire hazard. Maybe that's why my old one burned up. This model seems to be working well.
3,This is NOT the original 1932 edition!!!! Beware!!!!,"This is a reprint of the vocal score issued in 1935 by Universal Edition and MUSGIS Moskvá. Already there's censorship of both the music and the text present (not as severe as with the 1962 ""Katjerína Izmáylova"" version, Op.29/114 - but still purged enough - the irony is that it still wasn't tamed enough for Stáljin's tastes!). While good as a curiosity, save your money and first buy the vocal score of the 1932 version from Hans Sikorski (especially if you can accept not having an English text - they have it in Russian and German - either way, it's still in print to the best of my knowledge) - OR wait until they publish the English text that has already been prepared for Boosey & Hawkes."
1,No drainage holes,Drainage holes are a MUST for bonsai pots. We have to drill them ourselves and is is not easy! Do not recommend.
2,One kick-ass movie???,"Samourais has alot of problems. It starts off with pretty OK, the plot centers around an ancient demon using technology and magic to stay alive, but then everything goes KABLOOEY when the action moves to France.The movie is like a poorly made Frankenstien's Monster: it got up off of the operating table but comes apart at the seams shortly afterwards. Samourais has some decent fight scenes, but is filled with bad acting and silliness which reaches a critical mass towards the end of the movie.Send this one back, it needs more seasoning."
1,The horrors of Samourais,"If you are so masochistic as to rent/buy/fail to smash this DVD the moment you spot it, then you get what you deserve. This movie is an excellent illustration of why France and Japan are so far apart on the globe ... and why they should remain that way indefinitely, without any cultural contact. Ever."
5,fairly original concept,"I like the movie based on how it blends the east and the west, the new and the old."
3,No CD-ROM,The book was supposed to bring a CD but it wasn't. I wrote a note but still waiting for an answer...
3,GOOD BOOK but OLD CDrom RELEASE,"I'm very happy for my new English Vocabulary in Use Ipper Intermediate, but I was disappointed for the CDrom. It was not IT updating, unfortunately I received it for Windows XP or 2000. Really I expect it at least for Window Vista or Window 7!! I bought also the Business Vocabulary, in this case the CDrom included had got the new release. Why this not?"
1,the product is not good. Only after I sent 13 e-mails complaining about the vendor replied.,"the product is not good. Only after I sent 13 e-mails complaining about the vendor replied.i have bought an edition of ""the key to the bible"" and i have several problems.non of the bonus material is available, it is not possible to open it from non of my computers. i also tryed it on computers of my friends, but it did not work. i would be glad for your help. is it maybe possible that the bonus features are not available on Windows Vista."
4,As advertised,"The Pec Pad is exactly as advertised. I used them to clean archived 35mm kodachrome slides. The pads allowed even application of the cleaning solution. The pads also removed the solution with out leaving any streaks or lint. Overall, the product performs as expected. The only thing is that the package is a bit difficult to open without exposing all the pads. A fairly minor issue though."
1,PEC*PAD not are maybe safe on anything but coated lenes,"So I have a high end Super-Multi-Coated filter and now it has swirl marks. I pre-cleaned the surface first to remove heavy grit and dirt. This is a blower and finally light swabbing with a Pec*Pad. Then switched over to the Eclipse liquid and followed instructions. As a previous reviewer had done, I looked over the surface with a high intensity light and could see fine marks... It was later I tried to clean a junk lens and moved the pad in a linear direction and tested under light and found the fine scratches in the direction of the cleaning. So I would say that this is not as safe as claimed. It also leaves residues behind from either the pad or the oils that are loosened, but not absorbed so I would only be pushing the oils around. My micro-fiber cloths are far better...infinitely better and pass all light tests for scratches. It looks like I should go back to microfiber cloths at $7 bucks a pop and keep retiring them every dozen uses...$$$."
1,Horrible for cleaning lens,"Well, the package says lint-free and non-abrasive and both statements are true. The problem is, you cannot use these pads to clean a lens, it only ends up smearing and making the problem worse! I bought these with the hope of placing a drop of lens cleaning solution and then using these to buff my lens clean of oil and smudges and these pads only make the problem 10x worse! They are 100% non-absorbent so they leave a smeared mess all over the lens. I was really hoping this was the good stuff. Instead, I just wasted 10 bucks."
2,Disappointed,"I heard great review about these wipes. Yes they are lint free, but when i wipe my lenses with them they leave some sort of oily film on the surface. Or they just spread out what was already on the lens. I am not using them."
1,Try Something Else,I tried my best to use these photowipes in accordance with the instructions but I nevertheless ruined two irreplacable slides in the process. After that I mainly used my photo editing software to remove blemages .... a slow but safe process.
2,Hard to keep moist,"The wipers work great. No complaint. However, you only need one or two at a time and the other 98 or 99 will dry out and become useless unless you take some care. I used these at work and unfortunately did not have a zip lock bag handy. By the time I got home that evening the others were just tissues. Before you open the package, have your zip lock bag ready and maybe even put a damp paper towel in the bag with this package to keep the sheet moist."
1,NOT FOR WIPING BLANKETS ON DIGITAL PRESS,THESE ARE THE WORSE ONES I HAVE TRIED..... THEY LEAVE SO MUCH LINT ON THE BLANKET.... THEY ARE NOT FOR MY PRESS. I FOUND THE RIGHT ONES AT HIGH TEC INDUSTRIES.... EXCELLENT FOR THE DIGITAL PRESS.
3,Works ok I guess,"I purchased these Pec Pads based on the reviews read here, but when I used them with a cleaning solution that I already had, all I got was streaks on my lenses and LCD. I am going to reserve bad judgment until I receive my new order of Eclipse Solution.They are really lint free though."
1,Left residue smeared on lens,"I tested these Pec Pads with Eclipse cleaning solution on a lens filter that was already 99% clean to see if I could get it to 100%. The Pec Pads left a smeared residue on the filter. I retested the Eclipse with a microfiber cloth, and the residue disappeared. So the Pec Pads created the residue. Stick to microfiber cloth, folks! And Eclipse works no better than pure isopropyl (not rubbing) alcohol, which is much cheaper and available at your local drugstore."
4,Lens Cleaning Wipes,"Perfect for cleaning camera lens, slides and film. So far no scratching of the lens or film surfaces. Use in combo with bulb blower to remove particles from film and lens."
3,Christian Rock,"I've been a born again Christian for several years now and saw this band Petra on the 700 Club. The singer's voice is fine. Key tracks are: If I Had to Die for You, Hello Again and Shadow of a Doubt. A fine album to reflect your faith. They are one of the most successful Christian rock bands ever. Their name is the Greek word for ""rock."""
4,Several solid tunes.,"This album was a good effort by the new crew of Petra, but is definately overpowered by works like Beyond Belief and Petra Praise II. For anyone looking for a first Petra CD I would recommened the former two. This is a new Petra sound that is definately worth a listen however and inspiring songs like Falling Up and If I Had to Die For Someone make this albumn worth it. Their musical style seems to be in transition on this albumn however and its hard to classify in terms of modern styles."
4,"Good album, but just good.","Don't get me wrong, it's the best album Petra's done for awhile, but it can't rival the ""Not of this World"" days! I've been a Petra fan since 1976 and I own every one of their albums including ""Petra"" on the original Black-and-White cassette. I've been disappointed lately by ""Unseen Power"", ""Wake-Up Call"", and a little by ""No Doubt"", but ""God Fixation"" puts Petra on the rise again. Not nearly as crisp and excellent as Petra's crowning achivement, ""Beyond Belief"", but DEFINITELY worth a listen!"
4,Much better thanNo Doubt.,"I have listened to this album and it turned me on to Petra. Now I own 11 Petra cd's. The title track does leave a little to be desired, but FALLING UP, seems like they have returned to the old ways. A MATTER OF TIME is a retirn to the hard hitting style of Unseen Power. IF I HAD TO DIE FOR SOMEONE? really gets you thinking about Christ's death on the cross, and could we die for him. This album is lacking in the message side of Petra's songs. They are more hidden than usal. I give four stars. But again it is better than No Doubt. A relly good album for Petra starters."
4,No earthquakes here but a cut above the rest,"As an 80s retro-rocker I heard this album for the first time and I was MORTIFIED! With the exception of two escapes from the ""Beyond Belief"" timewarp (It's just a matter of Time and God Fixation) the 80s rock feel had vanished. However, listening to this album for a second, third and fourth time, it hit me that this album has what most other recent Petra productions lack -namely class and strength in depth, as well as classy melodies and production far removed from the under-produced ""Wake-Up Call"" or the tacky, artificial ""No Doubt"". This is not material to blow your speakers apart in a tidal-wave of sound. But don't be fooled - it is very nearly as good as Beyond Belief in a totally different way."
4,"""Petra means Pop"" is their new Fixation.","I've probably listened to Petra since the time of my birth, and they're one of my favorite bands. Their albums from the late 80's and early 90's are their finest work. However, their newest release doesn't quite match up to their hard rock of the past. GOD FIXATION lowers the tempo and creates a newer, more modern sound. Fans of the old Petra may be dissapointed with this release. But in quality it's a nice effort. My favorites are Matter of Time and St. Augustine's Pears. For every Petra fan out there willing to take a risk, buy this album. However if you prefer the late great Petra then you might want to research this album further."
4,Good but not great,"this is an o.k. c.d., but you should get No doubt instead. My favorite song is A Matter of Time. If you like christian rock go out and buy this c.d!!"
2,Give me a break,"When they dropped Volz, you knew the sound would change. With Hartman, and the original bass player gone it's a ^@*$^# crime they still call themselves Petra. This album shows certain creative influences are sorely missed. This is the album Petra will look back on and say ""We did this one to pay the bills!"""
5,"Right, let me think... um, well... BLOWAWAY! !","Petra never cease to amaze me by how they change the sound on every record they produce. And these songs are as good as Bob's first highest on Wake Up Call. The choruses on this album though are some of the most in your face that he has ever done and I love these kind of songs. John Schlitt is still in very good form, although probably not as high as i thought he would be but still awesome! The songs on this album are all so differnt in sound. That is why I love the album so much. None of the songs sound like each other which is brilliant! THIS ALBUM HAS INSIGHT, PASSION, BEATY AND SINGABLE SONGS THAT WILL MAKE YOU THINK FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE. My fav song is ""Shadow Of A Doubt"", my second favourite petra song ever."
4,The best of the post Hartman/Lawry & Gates albums,"This is by far their best album since the core players that gave us ""Fired Up"" through ""Wake Up Call"" left. Hartman seems more focused as a song writer and gives us some inspired messages to take to heart.Though we would see more personnel changes after this album, Hartman writing, Weaver setting the time and Schlitt belting out the songs like only he can, have helped to keep the Petra boat on course through all the changes in direction."
1,Pretty poor choice,"Incomplete. Superficial. Inaccurate. I felt taken, after paying for it and reading it all the way through."
1,NOT a good choice,"The writing in this book is very incoherent. It is really hard to read and the author rambles on and on about useless obvious things. The examples provided are erroneous. What the author calls a very complex sql query is actually a very basic sql query and on top of that is incorrect. Example: in trying to count the num of transactions, the author made the mistake of sum(tran_id) instead of count(tran_id). If he cannot write a simple select statement how could he provide input on data warehousing. I got more information from SQL OLAP Tutorial in the books online than from reading the 1st 4 chapters. Also the author does not provide any solid examples drawn from his experience. It appears as though he is summarizing the books online and another great data warehousing book, ""The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit"" by Ralph Kimball.Save your money and look for another book."
2,Misleading title,"A better title maybe ""Professional Data Warehousing with OLAP Services in SQLServer 7.0"". As a designer and developer of a data warehouse back-end, I thought I had found a great book to enlighten me as to SQLServer7 specific data warehousing techniques, but in reality the author rarely deviates from discussing OLAP in SQLServer and data cubes. If you're looking for information on creating and optimizing a data warehouse as a back-end system, I would highly suggest looking elsewhere. Although there is basically no discussion of data warehousing, the book ""Transact-SQL Programming"" offers a much more well rounded approach to the awsome capabilities of SQLServer."
2,WROX - shame on you,"I know WROX books and until this one they were very good or excellent. This one is no help to anybody. Author touches a lot of subjects not giving you anything on any of them. Almost anything you can also find in Books OnLine (bad as they are).If you need serious book, look for E. Thomsen titles."
1,Disappointed by the size/lack of good content,"Don't be fooled into thinking Speedy Spanish for Physical Therapists is actually a book. It is about the size of an index card and only has a few pages. Okay as a pocket reference, I suppose, but not great if learning any amount of Spanish is your goal."
3,Not Dilruba,"Hi, this is not a Dilruba, it is an Esraj, a very similar instrument. The body is smaller and there are fewer strings than the Dilruba."
1,Don't waste your time,"Don't waste your time on this movie. No better than if it had been a high school production made movie.If you want to see something with a Beast, suggest ""The Beast"" with Sirpa Lane. The Beast is very fake in both movies, but at least you enjoy what you are watching."
3,Silly Love Story,"A woman who is desires to find love by her 30th birthday. It is cute how the one person who is the ""right guy"" is standing what in front of her face."
5,true life re-energized,I wish i had had this book 20 years ago but it helped me so much even now. Each story is a book unto inself and the thoughts of the women are so true to life. Even now at 63 I feel re-energized by this book that there might still be another someone out there that will see me for who i am and not what i can do for them. it's made me rethink about the rest of my life. i admire the writers as much as the characters they wrote about. thank you so so much. For those wanting a-life-after-divorce or a-life-after-death this is the book to get. I had gotten it free but would gladly have paid full price.
3,"A light, funny read","Reminded me of the stories published in the Digest magazines. The stories are funny and lighthearted, and I enjoyed them very much."
5,Four from the heart!,"Wow! What a gift! Not only four wonderful stories, but a great all-purpose gift for boomer men to give boomer women (and others). All four authors write from the heart with verve and good humor. Each story reminds us of imporant lessons (even those of us who don't have pantyhose to give up). It's good reading. Give it a try."
2,Full of pictures with missing information,"I bought this book in order to gain practical information on cichled species and their identification but I am highly dissapointed. It is full of pictures with a lot of missing information (such as sexsing, behaviour or breeding) and it is full of technical descriptions which are not helpful for an amateur aquarist. Photos of the lake Malawi and Tanganyika fishes are all mixed up; pages are not organised at all."
2,Don't repeat my mistake,"One expects when buying a book by such a respected author to acquire a truly great book. This is not the case with this book. First of all, most photography are of very poor quality. Second, not all pages are numbered! This make the job of identifying fishes a lot harder. I'm very disapointed."
5,An EMT's / Paramedic's MUST HAVE,"This is a must read for anyone working in the Emergency Medical field, it teaches how the first words spoken to a patient are the most critical and it show's credible evidence that not only is this method of communication nessicary but also medicine for the mind's healing capabilities. I not only recommend this to anyone who works with EMS but i request it become part of the Learing Criteria. The pertinent contained in this book is one that can only help, not only the care takers but the patient also, not just at the time of the accident but for a lifetime."
3,A Real Page-Turner,"Most of us think of civil law as a tedious, sometimes arcane world of legal technicalities that we'd just as soon not know about. Laurance Priddy, a Fort Worth attorney who has practiced personal-injury law for years, takes us inside that world in Critical Evidence, but the book proves that the wheels of justice don't always grind slowly forward. This is a fast-paced story, centered on a traffic accident during a rainstorm. A plaintiff's attorney, down on his luck, accepts a long-shot attempt to find justice for a victim's wife, and the resulting journey takes the reader through not only the world of civil law, but inside the personal world of its practitioners, and finally through a suspense-filled adventure in industrial espionage. The book is a real page-turner, and the reader will be rewarded at the outcome. The downsides include some editing flaws and strained credibility in the romantic encounters. But it will keep readers awake watching for the next turn of events."
3,Question,"Good read, but could do without the gratuitous sex. At the end what happened to Jim McSpadden how did he morph into Jim McDonald? Poor editing."
4,Very Lovely,I bought this watch for my wife any she love it. Small dial looks very nice. Colour of the belt is not very attractive. I never expect diamonds in a $90 watch. Price was a bargain.
4,Weak Binding,There isn't much left to say about the contents of this book so I won't bother. When I received my copy the other day I opened it and the binding partially came apart around the first few pages. Now the first page inside the front cover sticks out when I close the book. It just isn't put together as good as it should be.
5,Very Thurough,"This is a very thurough book about ANSI C++ from the creator. It is not for beginners to programming or C++, but is best used to fill in any holes in your knowledge. This IS the end all be all of ANSI C++ books. It's very 'math-bookey' and some of the sections are difficult to grasp, but if you want to be senior level C++, this will do it."
4,Very thorough treatment of C++,"I guess one wouldn't expect anything less from the designer of the language than a book that goes into extreme detail. This book is a valuable reference for those who really want to know the details of C++. It starts with the basics of the language and moves into higher level constructions, such as the STL. Through the book, Stroustrup is clear to describe exactly how the language behaves and what parts of C++ are implementation specific details. There are even bits of humor hidden in all of those pages.As other reviews have mentioned, this is not a good book for beginners. In fact, I don't think it is a good book for an experience programmer starting out with C++. If you are in either of those categories I recommend looking for something simpler. If you start out with this book you'll find yourself lost in the details. However, for those that are experienced programmers and know the fundmentals of C++, this book will serve as a valuable reference."
2,If you want to learn C++ don't buy this book,This is a tough review to write because I have great respect for the author. This book is totally confusing for someone new to C++ and once I had learned the language I seldom find anyrthing of value as far as refrence. If you want to learn C++ get a primer and use Acclerated by Koening and Moo. That book will get you up to speed and give you results quickly in C++.I really would like to know how to make this book useful. Features are explained then it seems that the same information is rehashed over and over with minor vartiations.I just try to read the book and try to learn somthing and I seem to rehash and rehash the same points or that it seems to me that the book is disorganized. I find that other books will expain thing better and if you have gone through other books you don't need this one.
2,"Poor Bible, but it's Bible","This book is nothing but a reference for language lawers. Unlike K&R it is not interesting, valuable for C++ programmers. It is too long to read and find something you just want to know. Unfortunately, the book is a standard book for C++. If you need to understand accurately what is the standard of whether you wnat or not, you should stock this at you bookshelf. I can say this book represents the weakness of C++."
1,Poorly Written,This book jumps around far too often to be readily comprehensible. It does not work well as an introduction to C++. This book was misused for an introductory class. I then learned C++ from other sources and now I try and come back to it as a reference and it is too dense to be helpful even now. I consider this book a severe waste of money.
5,C++ holy grail written by the language's creator himself,"I recommend this book to any level of C++ programmer. While it may be a challenge to understand for someone without a lot of C++ experience, this book is a comprehensive overview of C++ and object oriented (OO) programming in general. The text isn't easy to get through the first time beacuse the author assumes that the reader is comfortable with various functions and concepts. Sometimes functions or ideas are used in examples that aren't fully explained until later in the text.Bottom line: If you are a C++ programmer, you should probably own or have access to this book."
3,Not a first course text,I was assigned this book as a first course text in C++. Bad Idea! It may be as Whitehead said of all to follow Plato: a long list of foot notes to expound the dense writings of the master(OK thats not it exactly... but I think the point is clear). This book is very difficult for a beginner and should be avoided by all mortals for at least until you have gone through a more appropriate primer such as the one offered by Lipman and Lajoie.
5,Essential Reading for Real C++ Developers,"This is not an introductory programming book. This is a book about what C++ has to offer and how to best take advantage of it. It will be most useful to people that already know another language (C would make your life the easiest) and want to learn C++.The first three chapters do a great job introducing the major facilities of C++ and how to think in C++ terms. The coverage of different programming paradigms will be useful to all developers. Also, the material on inheritance and multiple inheritance in particular, is clear and insightful.This book is an excellent tutorial and reference. Though it is dense reading and the code examples are typically short but not inadequate. You may also have some trouble jumping around to a particular section as the examples often build from previous sections. But it is easy to backtrack to get the big picture.Anyone writing nontrivial C++ applications should read this book."
3,"If you need remember what is C++, this is the book.","If you need remember what is C++, this is the book. The book is not for beginners programmers: no tutorials, no examples well explained.The book don't have trick, compiler implementation or constructed decision language.The book show the standard, simply the standard..."
4,Great book for experienced C++ programmers,The book serves as a reference for experienced C++ programmers. It is to C++ what K+R is to C.
5,extremely dense,but this is really worth reading if you really want to master c++. not terribly easy reading though...
4,"The best reference, the worst introduction","A friend gave me this book. I have used it only in times where I already had done what I wanted to do, I just could't remember exactly how to do it. Implication: this is a horrible book from which to learn. If you don't know how to do something in C++, you won't learn it here. However; if you want to remember something, the detail in this book makes it an indespensible reference.More positively, this book covers everything I have ever eneded to know, and I imagine it covers everything there is to know about C++. I think anyone who writes in C++ needs this on the shelf; for Christ's sake, Stroustrup wrote the freakin language!Bottom line: Learn it first, buy this book for reference later."
5,totally unreal!,"This book is aimed at experts in C++ that wants to advance their programming skills in pure C++, not in MFC, DirectX, openGL, etc-just C++! The book covers many of the most important aspects of polymorphism to encapsulation and how C++ achieves brevity. This book explains many of the concepts throughout using examples and indirect dialogue to help the user gain maximim amount of practice and learning. What the book should of said at the back is ""THIS IS NOT FOR NOVICE!""i suggest you do not read SAMs books but rather read C++ complete reference! SAMs books are more like a vague type reference but once learnt the complete reference for C++, move on to this!!"
1,Disorganized thoughts of the writer reflected in book & lang,"C++ is a disorganized language and now we know why. It's inventer is not capable of organized thought. The organization of the book reflects the design, or rather, lack of design in the language itself.The similarities in the problems with the book and the language are often striking. Both suffer from lack of ""editing"". Both suffer from lack of overall design (the language features don't work well together, neither do the presentation topics in the book.)You can barely read 3 pages without Stroustrup providing a warning on some way the language allows you to hang yourself. Is it any wonder that software is so unreliable these days when so much of it is written in a language that is like running a gauntlet?I not only do not recommend this book, but if at all possible stay away from the language. Use Java, use C#... I don't care. You aren't likely to pick another OO language that isn't a vast improvement over C++."
3,C++ is not what it should be,"C is Unix and C++ is just another Multics in the programming language world.I would consisder C++ a testbed for language design and implementation, butnot a successful language.It has lots of features, and most of programmers would be misled and get confused(this culminates in c++0x)Bajarne told people to focus on techniques not features, it's really hardto follow in the real world though. I think a good programming language shouldbe simple and elegant, and won't cause confusion for any level of programers.C does a better job, and Java is ok. If I have other choices of OO programminglanguages, I would give it a try. C++ is really a dilemma for me."
3,Unless you already are a master in C++,"With all due respect to the C++ guru, the creator, I will say that this book didn't meet my expectation. I have been programming for last ten years, mostly in C and some C++. When I bought this book I thought it would be of the class of K&R for C. However, my experience so far has been different. I had to really struggle to locate answers to my doubts. But, I should also confess that time didn't permit me reading the whole book page by page. But so what! In fact I got better and faster answers through Google. I am sure many C++ professionals will probably think otherwise about this book. Who knows may be I will start loving the book after some time!"
5,Great Reference for Intermedite to Advanced C++ Programmers,"Don't buy this book if you are new to C++ and want to start learning from the ground up. That's not the audience the book was intended for. However, once you do attain some C++ knowledge, this book will be invaluable. I'm an experienced C++ programmer and software engineer, and this is the definitive reference for both myself and my colleagues. I've bought 2: one for the workplace and one for home, and I always learn something new and useful whenever I read through it. If you're a serious programmer, you don't want to be without this book."
3,"Lots of interesting details, like an annotated bibliography","The book reads like it was constructed from thousands of individual index cards. Sudden shifts in focus. Occasional interjections ""here's something almost no one else has noticed..."" Themes introduced and then dropped.Since it does not appear that Richard Rhodes has done original research in German, Polish, or Russian, the bibliography is a good starting point for those interested in doing their own holocaust research in English."
4,Remember,"With newly available Russian sources, the author tells again the story of Germany's plan to open up more land for expansion. The horror that is detailed is must reading, though mind numbing. Read so it may never happen again."
4,"Unremitting, Important, Well-Written","Richard Rhodes has dealt with violent topics in the past but nothing matches the horrors committed in this book on such a personal level. Masters of Death (The SS-Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust) will bring the reader quite close to the horrificly committed mass murders from both the perspectivie of the killers and the victims (of those very few who managed to survive). There is a little pyschobabble near the beginning mixed in with small bios of Hitler and Himmler that does not entirely hold together but it is minimal and, in no way, interferes with the important story told here. The author shows how the killing of Jews in Eastern Europe developed the methods and hardened the men, by making horror routine, to the Holocaust that followed of whiich these first years of killings were a part. This book is an important addition to Holocaust literature by an accomplished writer. This book is both very hard to read and difficult to put down."
4,A journey through Hell,"A key part of the Holocaust story, even with some flaws. Minor flaws are dates of U.S declarations of war. Major flaw is the failure to demonstrate how the Lonnie Athens theories of violence apply to specific individuals, or to the larger Nazi group. Also, the author's views on the basic nature of Jews compared to that of ethnic Germans, while interesting, is not fully developed.The Specific cases of brutality are just beyond comprehension"
4,Great Beach or Subway Book!,"A delightful book full of quick-paced, entertaining stories. A must-have for the beach or while commuting.The best stories in this book (IMHO) are: ""The New Guy Starts Wednesday"" by Tom Green and ""A Tempting Office"" by David Lignell.A MUST READ at a great price!"
3,Be sure to note.....,"....the weight of this item. It seems quite heavy around my neck.Unfortunately, as another reviewer stated, if you are upright, the filling goes to the bottom. I've tried shaking the filling where I want it before placing it in position and that helps, but then shifts even more weight to my neck.. It seems nicely made but if I had hung something of this weight around my neck before ordering, would not have purchased this wrap."
4,Very Pleased w/This Product.,"I just wanted to inform anyone who purchases this product - you will not be disappointed. I have arthritis in my neck and shoulder and once I heat this wrap and apply, I can feel the pain easing. I also recommend the shoulder wrap to anyone who has neck or shoulder problems."
3,"Cozy, but short lived","I suffer from tension in my neck and shoulders, and frequent headaches. I like the shape of the wrap - it encompasses my neck and shoulders nicely, and can double as a headache wrap as well because of its softness (not quilted so can fall easily over head and neck when lying down). The drawback is that it doesn't stay warm very long. I usually have to microwave it for 3 minutes to get the heat I desire, and it lasts around 20 minutes max. Also, as another reviewer pointed out, when you warm it up beyond the stated time (1 - 1/2 min. which doesn't get it nearly warm enough) the rice filling does get a certain ""toasty"" scent. Am going to try the Cherry Stone Neck Pillow ($25) next time."
4,Warm and Toasty,Ordered 2 of these as gifts. The people that got them loved them. To me they were a little heavy to wear on your shoulders. The shipping takes a long time - so just be aware when you order this.
5,Super Cape,"This cape is really something. It's so nice and relaxing. Heated or not, it's great. I love it."
2,"Teddy Bear's Picnic, VHS","This is a great children's video, however the quality was very bad. When I went looking for this video, there were many for sale at different price ranges. I bypassed the ones that claimed they were in ""good"" condition, and opted to pay a little more to the person who listed their copy of this video in ""very good"" condition. OH....NOT TRUE AT ALL. We have a brand new VCR with auto adjust tracking, and upon playing this video the very first time after we received it, the first 4-5 minutes were unwatchable due to bad quality. I was very upset, but did not return the video as I would have had to pay for shipping to send it clear across the US. Basically, I bought a piece of crap, not because of the content of the video, but because of the quality of the item. The seller was TOTALLY DISHONEST!! Won't buy from here again!!!"
4,Teddy Bear's Picnic VHS,"I am thrilled to have a copy of this video again! It was shipped extremely fast, allowing me to show it to my preschool class on Teddy Bear Day. I lost my first copy of this delightful story in the massive flood in New Orleans after the levees failed during Hurricane Katrina in 2005."
3,It almost suffices,"So this breaks most things you want to know quite well, and breaks it down so that anyone can understand it, which is good. I had a few questions my teacher didn't explain well enough but this helped me resolve those issues. My main problem is that one thing we don't have in English is not there, or at least not when I was looking for it, and that is the Indirect pronoun, it is never truly explained, although I know it is similar to a Dative in Latin. And it can be easily confused with the Direct Object Pronoun, I still am not sure what is the difference in the usage, but it doesn't not explain. This the only issue I have had with it yet, but it is helpful."
5,What a great idea for a book!,"This book makes the grammar of both English and Italian stand out in high relief. You'll emerge from it with a firmer grasp of both languages.If you want to learn Italian, it should be one of the first five things that you buy. The other four should be a good dictionary, How To Pronounce Italian Correctly (the booklet and tape cassette), Ultimate Italian (the book and audio CD or cassettes) and Pimsleur Italian, if you can afford it."
4,Great complement to an Introductory Italian Textbook or course!,"This grammar reference is not to be used by itself. It works best when used along with an Italian textbook or course. It is amazing when approaching the harder tenses, irregular verbs, gender differences, and plurality. It really compares side by side what the equivalent is in the English language with respect to grammar. It will not fail you. For example, there are things in every language, such as idioms, that are not easily translated or understood. This book touches on those subjects that are harder to most students, and effectively explains them in detail. I'm an advanced student of Italian, and I recommend it. :)"
4,English Grammar for Students of Italian,Great tool for those studying the Italian Language and need assistance in connecting our English grammar to the verbs and tenses of the Italian Language. Easy to understand .
1,Radios,"These work OK but 8 miles? No way. One of the cradles has broken already. We can't seem to get the volume right, either. Would not buy again."
4,good product and reasonably good service,One of the radios didn't work at all in the first delivery.It took several days (longer than I expected) to get the replacement delivered.The new pair works great.
5,Great for ski trip,I bought these for ski trips and they do a great job. You can reach your family member anywhere in the mountain under any type of weather. I found the battery life great too. No problem to report after using them for 2 winters.
3,Could Be Better,"The signal strength is adequate, however, they tend to pick up a lot of outside chatter. Even when you change the channel you really can't leave them on because of the intermittent chatter they pick up. It would also be nice if the base chargers were independent of one another so you could seperate them and charge them in different rooms/locations if need be."
2,Not loud enough,"I have experience with several other Talkabout models, and this 5500 model isn't loud enough. I have the volume cranked all the way up and it is not nearly as easy to hear someone speaking to me as the other models I have worked with (T4900 and T5620). The chirps and rings are loud, but the microphone doesn't seem to pick up voices very well. If the two of us press our lips on the microphone and speak loudly they transmit just fine (like the other models I have cited,) but who wants to kiss a walkie talkie all day???"
4,love it!,as a travel nurse i've found this as a great resource for the basics of communicating to spanish speaking people in the ER. Fits great in my pocket!
1,Crap,"I paid like 8$ for this, thinking I was getting a small pocket sized book I recieved a small pamphlet with a few useful phrases. It would be better to look it up online and write on a flash card than waste your money on this junk."
4,Marantec entry system worked great.,I have a marantec garage door opener and wanted to purchase a wireless entry for a 3rd garage door that I have. After reading reviews of generic systems I decided that they may not work on the Marantec type opener. I ordered this one and it installed in a matter of minutes and was easy to setup and use. Works great for me and I have not had any problems. I recommend this if you have a Marantec opener.
5,Great Price!,I recieved this brand new key pad after the one we had finally wore out. I called around town to see if any store had them in stock. I found it half the price on Amazon and I recieved it in 3 days. Worth the wait! Love Amazon!
5,Replacement long overdue,I was functioning without the keypad for about a year now and the minute it arrived I had it programmed and functioning flawlessly in minutes. Not sure why I waited so long.
2,Physical package door broke,"The unit works with the door opener fine. But the physical package of the unit is very flimsy. The door hinge broke after two weeks of use. The unit is located in a protected area so I hope it will continue to work. Marantec should design a better protective cover. I had a Sears door opener for eleven years not located in a protected area and I know the unit is still on the house and working, we moved from the house 4 years ago."
3,"Works great, but very bulky and an odd design","On the positive side, it is very easy to program and works great. Very simple to use. On the negative side it is very bulky and oddly designed. I use this as a remote opener on my garage and it is mounted. However, this unit is built for some reason so you can easily slide it off and take it with you? Makes no sense to me, as if you want that you should use the keychain remote which is very small. Also, when mounted it sticks out a couple of inches and is very noticable, like having a big lump on the side of your garage.So, while it does what it is supposed to, the design of it is less than stellar. Still, if you want a remote entry on a Marantec opener you don't have much choice and it does the job well."
1,Poor Quality,Poor quality - The plastic screw head that connects the key pad from the backing plate snapped when I tried to separate the two units. Then the key pad itself refused to reprogram to my security code. I finally ended up reprogramming the old unit I originally had and continue to use it.
3,Replacement,"As noted by many others below... the keypad will wear out. ***Be Advised*** you might want to buy 2However,the process to remove the old unit and replace it with the new is simple and easy! I don't think it took more than 15 minutes from the time I opened the box it shipped in until I had read the instructions, removed the old unit, programmed the new unit, placed it, and I finished by resetting the code on the old unit."
2,Flawed design,"The Marantec garage door opener has been very good. It is quiet and reliable, but a bit slow. The remote is a very flawed design. The material covering the buttons breaks within a year or so. It is disappointing that a very good opener is accompanied by a very poor remote."
3,"So far, so good","I've been using this for a couple of months and it seems ok. I don't use it very often, but I told my kids not to press the buttons very hard. I can see how the buttons could easily wear out as others have indicated. Programming it was extremely basic and it operates perfectly. Did not come with instructions/supplies to mount to anything other than wood"
1,.,These are all Christmas gifts. I will have a better idea at that time and will reply as time permits.
1,3 packs = 3 pair NOT,"The title of this says ""3-pack"". Then, the description says ""three pairs to a pack"". I was expecting to get what is advertised: 9 pairs of socks. Since I cannot wear the socks until this is resolved, I cannot comment on the socks. I can only say that they are falsely advertised and because of that, I have to waste my time arguing with people over the phone over $15 socks."
1,wear out,these socks wear out in the first day. the first pair had a hole in the toe before the first day was out and the soles went within a week.
2,Gold toe gets a bronze medal,"Facts - Purchased 12 pairs, have worn 4 pairs.Pros -They are socks, the blue socks have light blue seam near the toe.Cons - Thin, fall down, blue is too close to black, uncomfortable.Speculation - Will only get worse over time.Recommendation - Don't try these at home."
4,"Good quality, color is more like black","I bought these socks expecting them to be a dark grey, but the color is much closer to black. Other than that, they are good quality socks."
3,Socks are fine...,The actual socks aren't bad... It's the sticky remains that the sticker left behind. The sock is all sticky and the sticker wouldn't come off all the way. >:( I spent like 20 minutes trying to peel the sticker off and there are still remains.
4,Strong socks,"I'm a dance instructor and teach 30 hours a week. Gold Toe socks wear like iron. Other socks don't last more than a few weeks. Moreover, these stay put, so I don't get blisters. The only problem, they hug the leg, so you need to tug on them to get them on.Otherwise I'd give them a 5-star rating."
3,i thought they were made in the usa?,"I looked up mens drees socks online that were made in the u.s.a. and this metropolitian gold toe sock came up .this price was great but the socks were made in china ,and the socks were for my nephew who is a marine and i was disappionted when i saw the made in china label. My nephew only weres clothes made in the U.S.A. So i kept the socks and bought some from another site that said made inthe U.S.A. and gave those to my nephew and he loved the socks from the other company.So i would like to give this product a 5 star rating but i feel lied toO!"
3,Not great,"I have large calves and these have tendency to ""dig"" in on the top. Also after the first washing one pair began to fray at the top. Would not order again"
3,Gold toe men's metropolitan dress sock size 10-13,I bought these and ordered BLUE NAVY. They are definitively black. My size is nine and they are extra- large even thought I was very careful to choose the correct size. Will see if they shrink once I wash them. Otherwise they seem to be good socks.
3,Pretty good sock,Everything about these is great except for the fact that they are listed as Crew length but they are actually more like below the knee. If you don't mind that then these socks are good quality.
2,"Comfy, but they sag very easily","The Metropolitan socks are thin and fairly comfy, but they sag on the calves very easily. I pulled them up all the way and wore them for about 3 minutes walking down the street. They were already sagging down to my ankles! They are not tight at all.I'm 5'8"" and bought the ""one size"" sock. I'm in good shape and my calves are neither fat or sculpted.For $15/3-pair, I might as well have gotten a $5 3-pack of saggy dress socks at Walgreens."
4,I MISS ANDY!,It is a nice tribute to Andy Rooney - however it is not something that you set down to and watch both discs on the same day. We watch it mainly on Sunday nights after 60 Minutes just to get our A R Fix!!!!
1,"GREED City, USA","This guy has been dead for a hot minute, and someone is already looking to cash in...Something tells me Andy Rooney would not have wanted this..."
5,Instant digital photos!!,"Remember when Polaroid cameras where the ""in"" camera to have because you got instant gratification on the photos you took? Digital cameras offer a similar feel because you can immediate see the picture you took in the LCD screen. With this printer, you have best of both worlds, digital image quality on the Polaroid film. Most digital cameras have the ability to select images for a ""print order"". Simply select 10 or less images to print on the digital camera, put the memory card into the Polaroid 500 and print. It's that easy. The unit reads both CompactFlash and MMC memory (it comes with an MMC to CompactFlash adapter-very cool). Its very easy to use and light weight. A great addition to any digital photographer's arsenal."
1,Won't work with large-capacity Smart Media Cards,"What's not on the web site, and which I discovered only after buying it and opening it and some paper: while any size Compact Flash card will apparently work, this printer will accept only 32 meg Smart Media cards and smaller. Since I have (and need!) a 128 meg card for my Fuji 4700, the printer is useless to me--all I get is a card error message. It's a pity, because the price is right & it seems like a delightful toy."
1,It's true: large-capacity SM Cards don't work,"This printer does not work with 64MB and 128MB Smart Media cards. I verified this on the Polaroid website (deeply buried, of course!)"
4,Great for the price and for what it does,"Counting the rebate, and the included 10-photo film pack, you can't beat the price!Keep in mind:- Actual picture size is approx. 2.8 x 2.1 inches (tiny)- Printing cost is around 90 cents per little photo. Typical of Polaroid.- The colors on mine are a little red-shiftedOther than that, it is a great little photo printer. Perfect for kids.Didn't experience any paper jams (yet)."
5,Another fab entry in the Sisterchicks series,"Sisterchicks Down Under by Robin Jones Gunn is another fantastic entry in this Christian series. When Kathleen and her husband head to New Zealand for three months, he fills his time with work. Kathleen finds herself alone like never before until she meets Jill at the local coffee shop. The relationship between Kathleen and Jill is so natural as written by Gunn that it's easy to suspend disbelief in the improbabilities. Together they explore the beauty of New Zealand and God, and both grow as people and friends. This book is everything good chick-lit should be: quick reading, extremely enjoyable, lovable characters, with just a sprinkle of Christianity. Can't wait for the next book!"
5,Another Great Chick Adventure,"The latest installment of the Sisterchick series has two forty-something chicks -- Kathleen and Jill -- exploring New Zealand and Australia. More wonderfully laughable antics and moments of heartwarming growth, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact, I think this might be my favorite so far."
3,"Very cute item, but loose","These Slide Show Bracelets are super-cute, but the elastic that was used to string the picture links together wasn't strung tight enough making the bracelet somewhat loose. If it hadn't been for that, it would have been five stars, as the links were very attractive."
2,"BED, BATH, AND BEYOND THE GRAVE","The main characters are introduced by reading their rap sheet. A group of youthful offenders are being transported in a van to a work site 200 miles away. They start out in the morning and by night fall they still haven't arrived. The van breaks down and they go for help.After a mishap, they come across a house of a woman versed in the black arts. One of the offenders tells us the story of Killjoy, then he somehow arrives at the scene.The characters in this film are stiff. Killjoy is overly animated with cliche ""Freddy"" style lines. His humor is the sole attraction of the film, which makes it slightly better than the first feature, but not as good as the third one.Parental Guide: F-bombs, no sex, no nudity."
1,not even a funny bad movie,"this movie is straight up awful, my friends and i go out and rent the worst movies we can find to watch, hoping they will be hilariously bad......unfortunately there is nothing hilarious about this, its just painful to watch....way too much dialogue for these awful actors to handle, that Martinez cop says every line in the same monotonous tone, no matter if she is angry or ecstatic, and the deaths are so lame its ridiculous....when you see how killjoy dies you will want to cry, so anti climactic and pathetic....please dont even waste your money to rent this, even if its only 99 cents......go buy some gum or something instead, at least you will enjoy that"
1,Voodoo Clown,"As often as the voodoo religion and clowns cross paths this is the first movie to exploit this correlation. It deals with intercity youths with bad attitudes, and there excursion to the woods far from Los Angeles. One of the youths with her impeccible ability to use voodoo decides to summon Killjoy to save one of the hoodlums lives who was shot point blank with a shotgun. Instead Killjoy begins to eliminate the teens and not even the Voodoo lady, who's house they had discovered, can stop him. But luckily at the last minute one of the teens discovers a liquid which destroys the clown. Dumb movie dumb ending, and a dumb purchase. I only regret the one star I am giving this is as low as it gets."
5,Killjoy 2,"This is easily one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Comes packed with bad acting, unrealistic situations, and of course Killjoy. A couple of friends and I rented this from blockbuster, just because the cover made us laugh. After you get past the first 20 minuntes of absolute stupidity, Killjoy finally gets ""released."" From there on out its a comic fest."
1,Incredibly bad,"I picked this movie up because it starred Debbie Rochon. I'm a big fan of Debbie's work. I also enjoy most Full Moon/Tempe dvd's. They are usually good campy fun. But this movie fails on every level. It's not funny or scary it just plain stinks.! Also,the dvd is very lackluster and contains no extras So don't waste your money on this junk! Go buy ""Dead and Rotting"" instead it's much better!"
1,Don't see this!,"The worst movie ever made. A psycho horror movie with many cliches of other better horror movies. Bad acting, bad story, bad directing. Better keep your hands off it."
2,killjoy the retarded klown,haha i cant stop laffing when i watch this movie it has such bad acting and no special effects and the ending is so funny killjoy is sopost to be immortal like but a girl simply throws a jar of some kinda of liquid on his face and he begans to scream and hold his face and he simply falls over and dies it looks like they took petrolum jelly and put it on his face i will bet 17 bucks on that lol but i bought this movie cause to me its a good movie to laff at think of it as a comedy its on my top 10 favorite list of movies
4,"A little cliche, but still a great read.","I may be biased, but I usually enjoy rewriting history with super-heroes or fantasy thrown in. This is the first book I've read that throws the supernatural into a WWI setting, and I thought they did a great job. Bottom line: yes the plot/story is a little cliched, but I thought the injection of fantasy was extremely well done, and therefore deserves a 4 out of 5."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"I didn't really care for this. This is a story about a young man going to war and thinking there will be glory involved. There isn't, just a lot of death, destruction and a lot of dragons, elementals, pixies, fairies and other supernatural weapons of mass destruction to be found. An anti-war fantasy story, if you like."
1,Worthless Edit,"Anyone who has seen the entire non-edited version of this flick will be very disappointed with the DVD. The film wasn't meant for an R rating, so this version pretty much cuts out all the goods that was worth watching. Not only were the best scenes being edited, but they were done so poorly with obvious frame jumps. The question that plagues me is `why edit it?' Does someone actually intend to make this a movie to sit down and watch while eating his/her T.V. Dinner? Basically, the point of this movie was stripped away in the DVD format, so anyone hoping to get what s/he saw on say Cinemax will be dissatisfied."
3,"Good Movie, Bad DVD","The plot of this movie is pretty straightforward. Ava Lake portrays a voyeur who's using a camera to spy on the more intimate moments of her neighbors. For a softporn movie, the acting and plot really weren't that bad.The dvd though is sorely lacking. There's no menu. How can you release a dvd without a menu? It's like Abbott without Costello, it just doesn't work. There are are also a couple places where there are really bad edits of scenes. The most noticeable to me, was a scene with Ava Lake and Regina Russell. They start out kissing, then a quick cut to a candle, then another cut to the morning after scene. You'd expect a movie of this genre to have included a lot more between those than a 2 second shot of a burning candle.If you're thinking about this movie, skip it at the current price. Wait until it's in the bargain bin somewhere, or wait for the 'unrated' version. The movie is okay, but the DVD stinks."
5,Ava Lake,"This movie is not the greatest, but i gave it 5 stars cause of ava lake. Such a hot hot woman, if you find it for the right price buy it."
3,Eh,"I didn't want to give this a terrible review, because I use Azmira pretty religiously and am happy with other products of theirs. While this didn't work for my Dane, it doesn't mean it won't work for you. We're not 100% sure that she's dealing with allergies, and are starting to think it's yeast issues. With that said, I think she does have slight environmental allergies of some sort, but I saw no alleviation. Don't let this shy you away from this product because if it is allergies you are dealing with, this may help you...and Azmira stuff is great generally."
5,they did it again,"This cd is right up there with ""A comprehensive guide to modern rebellion"" and ""for God and Country"",, this is a great cd, by this cd and buy all of good riddance's cd's...........amazing, these guys do it all"
5,Shock to a Stagnant Game Market,"I had recently stopped playing games, namely FPS because I was so uninteresed in the relative lack of innovation. It was during this hiatus that a friend menioned No One Lives Forever. I was immediately drawn in by this Austin Powers/James Bond mix and had to be dragged away from the computer, mid-mission 2 hours later. NOLF quite effectively balances actions, cut-scenes, gadgetry, and pure thought process to produce one of the most enjoyable games in memory."
5,An Awsome Game,"I have never played a first person game that had such a variety of environments, such great dialog and so many cut scenes. Neither have I seen such great looking main character in any other game. Great story, hard bosses, and lots of enemies that can be avoided of shot on sight to save yourself from beeing discovered. Drive vehicles. Jump out of the airplanes. Have a punch out contest with a bad guy and solve a hard story puzzle - who is the Bad Guy..."
5,Challenging and Fun,"Finally a fresh title in the world of first-person shooters. There's lots of great features about this game. The enemy AI is great! I found myself yelling at it when I first played it - ""They're ducking and rolling!"". Very slick. Lots of different levels as well. Standard stuff like factories, but there's a sunken freighter (complete with sharks) and one level where you're actually falling out of a plane and having a shootout in mid-air. Plus there's lots of humor in the game, both in the cutscenes as well as some of the dialog between enemy NPCs you hear as you go around the maps. Lots a fun and highly recommended!"
3,unfortuanelty,"Nice game, couldv,e been great .... expect for the fact that almost every character in this game is a joke, the main character,. nice spy... villians,. maybe if they werent so sweet and happy and funny looking,.. could have been great but the characters were just to childish to have a real FPS effect, just because its in FP doesnt mean that it is a true FPS,.. if your looking for something engrossing and something to get your adrenaline up then get Half-Life or Unreal Tournament"
3,Another FPS...,"I'll admit that my favorite games are usually not in the FPS category. It's not surprising then, to find out that I played this game and figured out after about 30 minutes of playing that this is just another one of those games.I'll admit that the theme is original, for a FPS, and that some of the levels are slightly intuitive, but the graphics didn't wow me. The enemies were also very easy to pick off.I've seen Austin Powers at least 20 times, and laugh every time. NOLF attempts to provide the same humor, but with less intelligence and wit.If you have an extra 50 bucks lying around, go for it. I'll take the buggy ""Giants: Citizen Kabuto"" over this game any day."
3,Who cares about the dumb conversations,"Number one - I love to blow stuff up and wipe out entire armies. That's my idea of a good computer game. This is not that kind of game.Pluses1) The graphics are good2) The user interface works well like other FPS3) Good weapons choices and usage4) Loved the musicMinuses1) Too much baloney between action scenes. Only losers would say ""I replayed the game just to hear the conversations.""2) See one again - especially the doggone training labs. Where's the skip button?3) Reference one again - too much setup in the story. Get me armed and let me exercise extreme prejudice.Read the positive vibes. Many admit they don't normally like FPS games. This might appeal to the wine and whine club, but if you want a real game - stick in the realm of unreal, half life, and quake."
4,"Great for its day, which is long past","I purchased this microdrive almost 4 years ago, for my DSLR camera. It worked great, the capacity was large, and the price was quite reasonable at the time! However, 1) the moving parts of a microdrive cause it to perform much more slowly than a genuine CompactFlash card, and 2) there are now larger and much better CF cards available, more cheaply."
5,you cannot miss it,A wonderful tragedy of love and death in a world destroyed by the 1st world war and the russian revolution... Marguerite Yourcenar's genius was transposed into screen in a superb fashion -- the movie was very well directed.
4,Black and White Vignette of World War I,"An unusual and thought-provoking movie about the intimate relationships, somewhat complicated by their levels of desire and intellectual emotion, of several characters during World War I in a Baltic country. The acting projects a natural yet guided reaction, occasionally theatrical and therefore memorable, to the lives of a group of German soliders, the residences of a grand house, and the surrounding villagers duing a stressful time."
3,a really nice film.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Known in France as ""Coup De Grace"" (Death-Blow) and in Germany as ""Der Fangschuß"" (The Catch Shot).. this is a remarkable film. Filmed in 1976 in Black and White, it has some great scenes.It follows the story of a Baltic woman who falls in love with a Prussian soldier in the late 1910's. When she is jilted by him, she becomes very depressed and joins the Bolsheviks.The film has some great scenery and they do a very good job at imitating the landscape as it was like almost 60 years earlier. and the fact it is in B&W; gives a good nostalgic touch to it.Unfortunately, the only special feature is an interview with the dierctor and screenwriter/actress. Volker Schlöndorff and Margarethe von Trotta, respectively.Still, it is a nice film one that will be enjoyed by quite a few people."
1,frightening book,"I have read alot of books regarding the turmoil in the middle east, some unbiased and informative and others merely to cash in on the current crisis. However, this one is one that truly scares me and the authors have the president's ear. I would give this book by Frum and Perle the same status and credibility as the Communist Manifesto (...)"
1,Rant,This book is a rant for a powerfull arrogant USA swinging the club for Israel in the world.David is a canadian who wrote bush's axis of evil speech.He is so closely involved with theneo conservatives in the white house that his writing no longerhas credibility.I used to find his conservative writing above par.Too bad people take him seriously.
1,"BOOK'S PLAN: SACRIFICE AMERICAN LIVES, SECURITY FOR ISRAEL","These men, both blatant Zionists whose main priority is Israel, suggest we go to war with the world so that Israel would be dominant in the Middle East. Not suprisingly, these men offer no end to the Palestinian plight. In these men's twisted world, countless lives of American soldiers not to mention civilians would be lost in a catastrophic battle that would ruin America's security forever. These extremists lied to get us into war with Iraq, so why would we start listening to them now?"
3,Logical Conclusions But Guaranteed To Bring Perpetual War,"carried to the extreme, the conclusions set forth in this book are entirely logical, if one believes in the precepts espoused by the authors...but one has got to think that there must be a better way...a third way if you will...otherwise, perpetual war will be a permanent state for the world-at-large...but perhaps we have already crossed the proverbial rubicon, in which case everything will indeed go as it has been written..."
2,Must Sterilize,"Do you remember the classic Star Trek when the Enterprise picks up the space robot, Nomad? Nomad was originally programmed to sterilize biological infestation on a planet somewhere, but now something has gone wrong. It thinks it must sterilize all imperfections including the crew of the Enterprise because they are ""imperfect units"". Though implausible and fantastic this episode seems like a fairly accurate representation of current American foreign policy and Mr. Bush's war on evil. And David Frum and Richard Perle have summarized the plan nicely in their book, An End to Evil."
1,Glass bubble policy,"This book is an attempt to defend the onslaughtof critical thinkers and writers against the Bush administration's policies. The writers obviously view the world from their Washington glass bubble offices. Just one recommendation for anyone attempting to write on world affairs. Go live and work in another country before writing books that are ""eyes wide shut""."
4,"Imagine there's no bad guys, it's easy if you.......","One always gets the chilly feeling that in the mire of 'international politics' and 'international law' lies the membership requirement of the suspension of disbelief. Today we all cheer an Iranian 'dialogue' that will supposedly, somehow, lead to them not acheiving nuclear status. This is a fools wish, and if pressed, I find that most anyone of any political persuasion will admit as much.In step Perle and Frum who tell you what you already know: don't be silly...these agreements have a flawless track record of failure for you to ignore at your peril. Wish all you'd like, but the truth just sits there, whether you choose to recognize it or not. By the ever-lofty and sadly humorous standards of 'world-opinion', this book would somehow be considered extreme. However, if we can't muster the backbone to realistically stare a problem down and see it clearly at this moment in history, in a decade this books suggestions will seem very practical, indeed."
3,The new 'Mein Kampf'? Give me a break,"Interesting, how many anonymous one-star reviews this book has attracted - and how many of them breathlessly refer to Frum and Perle's *shocking* support for Israel. Tell me ""neocon"" hasn't become a politically correct way for raving anti-Semites to avoid blaming ""Jews"".The book - which I'm *sure* all these anonymous reviewers have actually read - is a pretty good overview of the threats faced by America and its allies. Anyone looking for the Zionist cabal's blueprint for world domination should look elsewhere. It ain't here."
1,unfortunate,Bold concepts but unfortunately will ultimately lead to the destruction of everything they are claiming to seek to protect.These two and everyone like them represent the worst kind of fanaticism and are a greater threat to the American way of life than those they are claiming to fight.Ideals and human nature cannot be pacified by the use of technology. Their policies would eventually lead to bankrupting America and most of the developed world along with it. What they say they are trying to stop has been around since the dawn of human history.
1,A DOCUMENT OF WAR CRIMES BY WAR CRIMINALS,"When the current Neo Conservative Bush administration gets toppled this November, it is folks like Frum and Perle who will have to answer to the International tribunals that will be held for the illegal Iraq war we are currently engaged in.In writing this book, Frum and Perle provide self-incriminating evidence as being the architects of policies that violate international laws, human rights and threaten to destabilize international relations on a monumental level.Their reckless and idiotic propositions to act unilaterally against possible threats will exacerbate the dangerous situations and conditions the Bush administration has put America and its citizens in the global arena.Their xenophobic and Orwellian notions on tighter immigration controls and National I.D. cards go against the very principles of what this country was founded on, that all men have the right to pursue life, liberty and happiness."
1,"Ah, Mein Kampf, how I miss thee!","On the Daily Show with Jon Stewart Jan 27 2004, Mr Perle talked about the increasing need to remain stalwart in our conviction to rid the world of terror.He also said that Canada would be there to help after it ""was all over.""On 911 what country allowed hundreds of US airliners to make emergency landings? CanadaWhat country's citizens threw open their homes and their hearts to thousands of stranded American travellers on 911? CanadaWhat country has the largest peace-keeping contingent in Afghanistan? Canada.What country has had more of it's soldiers killed by the US Air Force than by the Taliban? CanadaPerle and Frum are evil malicious liars and mockers of the truth.Their frightening neo-con pro-Israel propaganda is hateful, ignorant, and reflects the rising tide of facism in the worlds' once most free nation."
1,Childish and Irresponsible,"As I read through the pages, I can't help but laugh at the childish ideas of the authors. Yet at the same time, I'm worried because they hold influences on US policy, as evidenced by how Bush Administration was able to offend just about every country in the world. I travelled frequently, and everyone told me, ""We love Americans, but your government sucks!"" Muslim population in the world is 1 Billion. To do anything suggested in the book is pure racism and totally against the great American values. I'm returning this book for a refund. It makes my house dirty."
1,Amateur Night for Auditioning Terrorism Experts,"Neither author is versed in the subject of terrorism; they do not know the regions of the world they discuss nor do they have any international relations expertise. Their ""solutions"" include bureaucratic reshuffling, a hopeless enterprise (look at the Homeland Security mess!), and an ID card for everyone in the United States, hardly a solution for anything. This thing is high on drama and hubris, but there is no substantive contribution whatever."
1,Disturbed,"I find that neoconservatives are generally disturbing, at least because they feel they are objectively right, but above all because they are totally wrong. This sloppy arrangement of thoughts espouses world domination and exhibits ethnocentrism at its deepest and most chilling levels. Feel free to read this book, but beware that Hitler could also convince the masses. Can we assume that Nazis were all stupid? Or were they were misled, cheated, hateful and taught to fear? This book needs more than a grain of salt."
2,Some good ideas but overreaching,"An end to evil? Sounds a bit utopian to me. What the authors propose is simple: war without end against terrorist states-e.g. Iran, North Korea, Saudia Arabia, etc... Ultimately, this will be costly beyond imagination, both in blood and money. As we have seen in Iraq, ""regime change"" is more difficult in practice than theory.This is not to say the book is without value. Frum and Perle do make some constructive suggestions regarding our failed immigration policies. It's probably worth checking out of the library, but it isn't good enough to justify the price."
1,Shoddy and dishonest work,"these two authors have produced a dispairingly thoughtless piece of work. Their strategic thinking does not seem to transcend the slogan ""we have might therefore we are right"".A simple glance at history should have told them that powerful and undefeatable empires were brought down again and again by this sort of blind crusading.I asked myself as to how two think tank scholars could produce such shoddily put together foreign policy strategy. After some research I came to understand the backgrounds of the authors. Frum was an obscure canadian right wing columnist until he gained prominance with his ""brilliant"" ""axis of evil"" term (a two year old could do better), and since then seems to have deluded himself into thinking that he is qualified for defining the foreign policy of the United States. As for Perle, well there seems to be enough questions around his motivations and qualifications. Too bad, for the missed opportunity of this book."
1,"Truly scary book, must read",[...] This book argues for Regime changes in Syria and Iran and a more aggressive policy stance towards Saudi Arabia and Frace. [...] This book is both a warning and a call to action.
1,Sieg Heil - Hail Victory to Bush and Co,"If you like violence unfounded ideas, hate, hate and more hate please read and believe this book. If you are a decent human being who believes that the pen is mightier than the sword you should read other things. The book is a huge collection of namecalling, insults, and ideas that can't be implemented, supported or proven. The only difference to ""Mein Kampf"" is that it is easier to read, has two authors and replaces German with American."
1,Save your money,A simplistic binary view of the world that spends more time justifying its ghetto mentality (us versus them) to the world than anything else. Ill informed and poorly written.
1,these guys are over the top,"These guys are over the top -- moreextreme views from the heart of the Neoconmovement. Who knows what their agenda is,but it sure doesn't sound like the oneI or my neighbors have. I find their viewsscary, to say the least."
2,I prefer to read about facts than wishes,"I had great expectations for this book but I was let down by the repetition of well known arguments which one can read in newspapers and magazines. Some parts of the analysis are very good, especially those regarding Israel, the history of US commitment in the Middle East and the reasons that Saddam's regime had to exterminated. But the proposed solutions are vague and they suffer from the extremely little knowledge we currently have regarding Al Qaeda's operational capabilities and future plans. What will happen if there is a rapid political change in Pakistan or Egypt for example, and how can USA react? The enemy of the Western powers is so elusive and has such an imagination for mass killing that it is not prudent for someone to give solid advice on the homeland security measures that should be taken."
2,Is it for real?,"At first I thought this book was tongue-in-cheek: Suggesting America should perhaps declare France a new enemy? There's no place for Palestinians in the world? It's no joke. This book frightened me, because Perle and Frum actually mean what they write about. Read it to find out exactly what kind of terrifying agenda the Bush advisors really have in mind, and learn about this new huge thread to world peace."
5,WMD armed terrorists? How to defeat them.,"The authors at least take seriously the threat which proliferation of WMD presents. Their critics (see Katutani in NYTimes) often fail to address their essential arguments, much less offer an alternative which would take the threat seriously, focusing their criticism instead on the authors' attitude or on ancillary points. Frum's recent article in National Review Online challenges critics to offer their own strategy for meeting the threat of WMD getting into the hands of terrorists."
4,An Almost Cogent Strategy,"Messrs. Frum and Perle have written an excellent and timely book. It provides a needed political and military strategy, which goes beyond the tepid and politically correct bounds of the Bush administration. It names nations that promulgate and harbor terrorism (such as Saudi Arabia and Iran) and is willing to bite the bullet where action is required.My sole qualm is that by lack of a philosophical foundation there is a limit to its ideological clarity. Thus it slips into the vogue beliefs of imposing democracy, finding hope for the UN and Islam, and accommodating the foibles of ÒalliesÓ. Perhaps such views could be defended, but it appears that this book simply adopts such positions for reasons of expediency. Nonetheless, I strongly recommend his book."
1,Just nuts,"I was going to write a long review, but it boils down to this: David Frum and Richard Perle are nuts. Just nuts. It's as simple as that."
1,bye bye miss american empire,Two thoughts cross the mind while reading this book1. There ARE people in government who for whatever reason think it's time to sink the USA ship2. These two men are crazy as hell
3,Sound Ideas But Too Much Recycled Information,"I looked forward to this book because I'm on the same page as the authors--wanting to be proactive in the war against terrorism. But the book, full of logical, convincing, and coherent arguments, was for me and I suppose anyone who reads the newspapers, a bit redundant. It didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know regarding the Left's weak stance on terrorism and the various obstacles that our country faces as we try to protect ourselves. Anyone who reads a modicum of news will probably not learn anything new. However, it is an effective document that backs up its sources so that you can use it when arguing with people who disagree with you."
3,It's ok...but I perfer Mighty Grip,"I purchased this to help my grip with the fitness pole. I wasn't impressed. I will definately stick with Mighty Grip...Mighty Grip is 10 x better than this product. Mighty Grip doesn't transfer onto the pole (bat, racket, equipment, etc) and it is environmentally friendly and great to use."
4,Romantic,This was one of the biggest films in 2001 with a big cast having Ajay and Madz with Preity who was growing popularly.Direction by Deepak Shivdasani is good in parts Music is okay
4,Good but isn't a keeper!,I liked this audio cassette recording of Constance O'Day Flannery's Time-Kept Promises and I liked the story about the modern day lady named Kris Gavin being transprted back in time and meeting Sean O'Mara and Sean thinking that Kris is his missing lookalike wife who apparently is not a nice person so that would explain why Sean is so rude to Kris and why he is so shocked that the person he thinks is his cold hearted wife is so much nicer and you can understand his being cynical. Though I liked this story I didn't think it was a keeper.
4,Time passes slowly,"This book is a good time travel, but it gets slow in a lot of spots. I can normally absorb a book quickly that I can't put down. This one I've been putting down often. It seems to drag in places. Don't get me wrong I think it's worth the read, and the premise is very good. But it's just not an I can't put you down book."
1,The usual film,This film insults our intelligence. Another shoot them up movie that forgets to define the meaning of a plot.
2,stupid movie.,"you'll see it anyway cause of all the good reviews, but it is pretty lame. i've seen worse, and at least it didn't try to take itself TOO seriously, but then how could it? pretty silly and the ""action"" scenes go on far too long. like one of those horror movies where the killer just won't die (and he won't in this movie either), so too this movie just won't end. stick to back to the future or videodrome for either of these actors doing anything worthwhile."
4,Great fun,It was great fun to get this movie and watch it after all these years. Fox and Woods have great chemistry together. It was also great to see a LL Cool J in one of his first movie roles. This movie has some of my fav one liners as well. If you are looking for some good laughs and action and somewhat campy fun you will enjoy this blast from the past.
3,Average Buddy Cop Movie,"The Hard Way is a buddy cop action-comedy that won't make anyone forget Lethal Weapon. Or Lethal Weapon 2. Or Lethal Weapon 3. Or Lethal Weapon 4. You get the picture. It doesn't have as much action or comedy as we've come to expect from the buddy cop genre. Still, James Woods is good as the cranky cop, and Michael J. Fox gets a few laughs as the actor researching the role of a lifetime."
5,The Hard Way is the bestest comedy action adventure movie!,"The Hard Way is the amaze me with action and adventure also with comedy Michael J. Fox plays as the Hollywood actor, Nick Lang and James Woods as John Moss, the toughest cop in New York City to track down the serial killer, The Party Crasher(Stephen Lang)and Nick Lang named as the new partner name is Ray Cassanov, also co-starring includes LL Cool J, Christina Ricci, Penny Marshall, and Delroy Lindo."
1,BUYER BE WARE!!!,THIS ITEM CLAIMS TO BE PASLODE 650014 GALVANIZED NAILS. IT IS ACTUALLY 650026 BRITE NAILS. THE TILE MISLEADS YOU INTO THINKING IT'S 650014 BUT THE SMALL PRINT SAYS IT'S 650026.
5,beautiful tiara,no problem with my order it came really fast and it was even betterthan i expected.. it was made very well and my daughter loved it
5,amazing lip product,"This product is amazing. Chicago winter lips are very hard to get rid of. This product worked its wonders in about 3 days. In fact, my boyfriend said that kissing me was an absolute pleasure. Now, that's high praise-we've been dating for 4+ years and have kissed many times ;-)"
3,"Great stuff, but $6.00 ??????",Not at all worth the cost. not any better than other's I've used for half the price. Oh well...
5,Amazing for Lips!,This product makes my lips so soft!!! Not only do I use it every night but I also carry one in my purse and one in my briefcase. It goes on in a thin layer and melts right into my lips leaving them so soft.
5,knife bag,I personally think they need to make a larger one because I have a lot of knives but an awesome product!
1,Is it made by Shun?,"I can't believe that it's bearing the brand name of Shun.One clasp can not be closed and locked properly, because one side of it is bent.The mesh pocket, the mesh is not stitched to the back at one narrow edge.The flap is made of artificial leather, or what they called leather treatment?"
1,I sent mine back for a refund...,"At work (a large Luxury Collection Hotel) it is unanimous that finding the right bag for you can be tricky, particularly ordering on-line. I absolutely HATED the outside of the bag which was exactly like Velcro fuzz. Impossible to keep clean. Why would any company do that? I have 7 shun knives and was hoping to love it. The elastic that holds your knife handles in place is extremely tight, so I couldn't fit any of my Wusthof, which are NOT huge handled. I couldn't put any garde manger tools either. I traded it for a Global, and EVERYTHING fits, including a Benriner mandolin and a box of round cutters. Before this, I thought I was going to resort to a tool box, and those things can be HUGE."
3,Not Keen On Velcro,I recently purchased several Shun Knives and because of their sharpness I decided I needed a place to store them so others would not get hurt by cutting themselves. I ordered this Shun Knife storage case. I eagerly awaited its delivery and was disapointed when I found out the storage spaces used velcro to hold the knives in place. I was also disapointed to find out that the end you stick the blades in were to small for anything with a bigger blade than a 10 inch chefs knife. I plan to use this case even with my disapointments. I hope the velcro wont hurt the handles or blades and I also hope my 10 inch chefs knife doesn't cut through the slot that I found for it to fit in. I recommend you continue to shop for a better knife storage case than this one.
1,"Cheap, limiting and Disappointing","I bought this for some knives that I recently purchased.The leather is imitation, one of the clasps does not close unless you force it, It never arrived with a Velcro strap to secure the blades. AND the worst part of all, is it wont hold any of my knifes that are over the size of a 6"" utility knife. None of my knives are Shun classics. They are all Shun Premiers, Elites, MAC's or globals. I can't fit any of my hones into the case, and most of my garnish tools wont fit.If you own Shun classics you will probably be okay, but nothing else I own will fit. I even tried my Henckel Pro S chefs and Santoku from my older set, and they wont fit.I will be returning this case immediately."
3,Two Color Harmony 2's are the same book,"There's a lot of confusion about the two versions of Color Harmony 2 because the difference seems to be the CD -- both versions credit Bride M. Whelan as author; the less expensive version doesn't come with the CD (which I haven't used).The comments on color combinations have been helpful in convincing client/coworkers -- ""but this is a Professional palette!"" The book's palettes can be a useful starting place.One caveat: written in 1994, the New Trends section is a bit dated, unfortunately."
2,Palette Picker,"This book is ok for the beginner, but I should have bought something more like the Designers Guide to Color Series. First Color Harmony 2 is basic art class. Second the cd rom is not what I thought it would be. I was expecting something more like a paint palette where I could create, or mix my own colors and then have the software comeup with the complementary, split-complementary, analagous combinations etc. Instead I am limited to the 106 individual programmed colors. So I was really disappointed. And didn't think it was worth the price."
5,I need a superhero lover :),"Let's go back to the club classicskinda bubblegummish but still a must to own in anyones club collection,,, better get it before it goes out of print"
5,Deep and Ironic but fun for you when you're down,This is the type of movie that is good for you to watch when you are really fed up with someone. It is full of poetic justice and just leaves you with the feeling of hope! It is a wonderful drama!
1,OF HUMAN BONDAGE DVD,"IT SHOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW TO SELL SUCH JUNK. UNBELIEVABLY AWFUL. I FEEL I'VE BEEN RIPPED OFF AND WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK. THE QUALITY WAS HORRIFIC----NOTHING BUT STATIC AND SNOW & JERKY MOVEMENTS..NOTE TO SELF--KEEP RECORD OF VENDOR AND ""NEVER EVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN' THERE COULD BE NO LEGITIMATE REASON FOR PRODUCING SUCH JUNK EXCEPT FOR PURE FINANCIAL GAIN....IT CERTAINLY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN TO SERVE THE PUBLIC. ZERO STARS FOR THIS ITEM....""OF HUMAN BONDAGE"" WITH BETTY DAVIS"
3,Excellent Performances Make Up For Dated Film,"An extremely dated film in terms of script and style, ""Of Human Bondage"" sports exceptionally excellent performances with Bette Davis a standout in the role of a vicious-minded cockney waitress on the make. The dated quality of the film will no doubt turn most viewers off, but those who endure are in for a treat."
1,Terrible Print Sloughed Off on Terrible DVD,"I'm not commenting on the quality of the movie itself, but of the DVD. This DVD has been taken from a worn-out, scratchy, blurry, indistinct print. Other reviewers have commented that there is no discernible difference between VHS and DVD versions; no doubt there has been no movement by any organization or company to locate a better print. Beware of buying this for more than ""cheapie, budget""prices. I recommend renting the DVD if you must see the movie; otherwise I'd be patient and wait for the day the movie is ""rediscovered"" and issued properly so that it can actually be seen and heard."
3,"Great Movie, Poor Picture & Sound","Great movie that put Bette Davis on the map; her breakout performance. The problem here, and it's a serious one, is the picture and sound quality, which are both poor. A shame. I had trouble making out the dialogue. It would be great if this film could be remastered/restored someday, but in the meantime, I think buyers should be made aware so they can at least make an informed decision re: whether to purchase."
4,Bette's Tour de Force,"This version of ""Of Human Bondage"" is hampered by the early 1930's puritanical production code.Nevertheless, Bette Davis turns in a fantastic performance as the sluttish Mildred.Leslie Howard is also effective as the masochistic Philip.All in all this is a 5 ""star"" film.So why did I only give it 4 ""stars""?The quality of the video is mediocre, the digital transfer is not good, the print used was scratched and the sound at times muddy."
4,Of Human Bondage,"The movie is great. I believe its pre code 1934 not sure what month it was made. This has always been one of my favorite films even as a child I enjoyed the acting and story without fully understanding the relationship between the lead characters.Unfortunately the film, at least my copy of the DVD is not as good quality as I thought it would be. If they could digitally restore this film it would be even better to watch.I think this is Bette Davis at her best as a young actress. Leslie Howard evokes a compassionate yet self pitying portrayal of a young man who follows his heart on a destructive path but he cannot let go. Bette is also a self destructive character in never being satisfied with what she has.This is a must have for early hollywood movies."
1,"Quality of ""old movie"" DVD","Acknowledging that the product was a reproduction of a very old (1934) movie, we were nonetheless disappointed in the quality of the picture, given current technology."
2,NOT in spanish,I specifically bought this Elmo video because it says it can be viewed in Spanish or English....NOT true! It only has the English viewing option.
5,Best eyedrops available,"I started using Systane when I got Lasik. These eyedrops are expensive, but they're seriously the best money can buy. They're absolutely worth it."
1,Company does not stand behind product,"I bought this unit from H.D. box store less than 3 years ago. During a brief power-outage today we noticed the coffee maker was freaking out and the toaster was super heating almost instantly. My electrician came over on an emergency call immediately. The upshot of the situation is that the generac's voltage regulator failed and was surging power into my home at 330 instead of the normal 220. The surge fried the mother-board on my gas furnace my ignitor (and possible other complications), messed up my invisible fence for my dog, fried a television and an alarm clock. The Generac customer service rep. told me that they are not responsible for complications of their units malfunction and that I should call my homeowners insurance. In the meantime I'm out about $1000.00 on furnace repairs etc. and no heat in the house. I would not recommend any product from this company."
2,This would be a really great generator if it were working,"I picked this particular generator, in spite of the high price, because it is big enough to power pretty a whole house (1st star) and is designed to start automatically (2nd star). The local authorized installer could not come for over a month but others in this area did not want to install because we did not buy from them. It was very frustrating to have a power failure during freezing weather and the generator was sitting in the backyard not hooked up. It has stopped working a couple of times already since it was installed and this time we have been trying to get someone to come and fix it for over a month."
2,"Disappointed by appearance of the ""book""","When I first got knowledge of the book, I was led to believe that this was a first-class book with coloured illustrations and so on. To my surprise, when the ""book"" came, it was no more than a homemade spiral-bound stack of photocopied paper ! While the material covered seems concise the presentation was just not pleasing(the resolution of some of the pictures was very very poor - a better printer and scanner could have helped or even professional help should have been considered).I expected more so BEWARE to others...For interesting work in Paper Tole, I recommend Creative Three-Dimensional Decoupage by Debbie Sellers. For sure that one does not go in depth about furring and feathering but it is indeed a BOOK ! Another one is the Paper Tole : Three Dimensional Decoupage (Milner Craft) - however it is hard to get online but you could try your local bookstore."
2,Great but poor in quality,"The book is well written but in order to understand the steps that are explained, you need to have better quality pictures. So, indirectly the book is useless to me. To beginners, you are still somewhat lost because without those clear pictures, you can not see how to relate what the author is saying."
2,Overpriced Book,"I purchased this book because I have always been fascinated and intrigued by the art/craft of paper tole. The cover seems to imply that the contents will be of the same quality. Though I found the treatment of the subject to be quite thorough, the quality of the photos is poor, in black and white, grainy and with poor resolution. I find it interesting that the the only supply source listed is that owned by the author..."
4,Good Book,"I am new to paper tolling so I was looking for a book that would have all of the basics as well as advanced techniques and this book is it. It is well written and easily understood as I had no knowledge of what exactly paper tole really is. The only complaint that I have is, exactly what others have written, that the presentation of the book is not exactly professional looking. The images aren't any help at all in that you can't even see them they appear to be poor photocopies of poor photocopies and the flimsy pages and ring binder give it an amateur feel. That said it is abundantly clear that the author has a vast knowledge of the subject and is very good at explaining each procedure step by step. I would recommend this book to anyone with a good amount of knowledge of craftwork or a basic knowledge of paper tole."
1,Worse (at best WORST) than what I could expect,"I was excited when I received my package. However when I opened it up and read the book ......I was shocked by the quality of what I have received. First the contents were bleak and non-detailed (except for furring and most of it is based on furring) - Second, the instructions were for VERY basic paper tolers. The graphics.....needless to say : VERY BAD. It reminds me of pieces of poorly photocopied picture.What use do I have for it? NONE. If I could, I would remove even that one star left on the 5 stars and give it a black hole of a rating. It sucked me into the joy and then crushes me when I open it up.I am VERY disappointed in this poorly made craft book.I would like to reinterate a point : it has little content on paper toling - don't waste your money like I did. It was really an expensive lesson for me."
5,one of my favorite cds,"This is absolutley one of my favorite cds! Unfortunately, someone else is now enjoying it. Since it is such a favorite, it is most always in my cd changer in the car. We traded that vehicle in last year and forgot to get the cds out! We called the dealer the next day and he said there weren't any cds in the changer. Someone got a good deal on some excellent music!"
5,"Pulitzer Prize...?? Well, no but still funny.","These two authors have a great website ""collegestories.com"" and I was very excited to see they finally published a book. Some of the slang they have written here is just hilarious. If you're looking for Hawthorne, or Dickens hit your back button, but if you're looking for basic crude, hysterical humor check this book out!"
5,Hilarious,Ben and Derrick serve up a manure-pile serving of the best college slang dervied from their site - CollegeStories.com. I've been a fan of the site for a while (hey - anything that originates from Wake Forest University has to be pretty damn good). The stories are hilarious and addictive to read. Buy their book for some good laughs.
3,"Great idea, but where was quality control?","This would be a five star toy for me were it not for a critical error. I was so excited to discover this toy, because my husband and I love the electronic 20 questions game and thought our Care Bear-loving 36 month old son would get a real kick out of this game. He does, but even he knows that a butterfly is NOT an animal! You can imagine our surprise when we tried over and over to get Care Bear to guess the butterfly card, but it could never get it. Finally on a hunch, we answered ""yes"" to the question ""is it an animal?"" Sure enough, a few questions later, it was able to guess ""butterfly"". We haven't done all the cards yet, so who knows what other errors are lurking in there. For the person who was missing the cards, here they are:bananabutterflyhouseice creamflowerhandfrogairplanetrainpigcakeboatcarumbrelladogkitecattreebirdorange"
3,Care Bears Guessing game,"My sister bought my daughter this Care Bear game, and you need cards to be able to play it (where the care bear ""guesses"" the objects. The box came without the cards, so it is pretty useless because we don't even know the objects. We emailed the company to get the cards, but have not heard from them as of yet. I will keep you all updated."
5,Music I never forgot,"I had the original Philips recording in college in 1967, which I played over and over. The record, long lost to me now, has lived in my memory as one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard. I am very grateful to the other reviewers, especially Michael O'Brien, for corroborating what I myself have always felt about the original recording, and providing information on how to locate it. I heard, some years ago, another recording of the mass, but there was absolutely no comparison. The ineffable sounds of the original are hard to describe. I will now track down a disk. I must hear Missa Luba again. Thanks for the help!"
2,Grieving over the absence of the original,"I'm so relieved to read all the reviews by folks who feel as I do about the comparison between the brilliant original by Les Troubadours du Roi Baudouin and this rather tepid redo.I used to play the Missa Luba every year on Christmas morning. (At other times too, but always on Christmas.) And I miss it terribly. I was all set to download these tracks, but after playing the clips I see they're in no way comparable. As other commenters have pointed out, they are a pale copy of the recording we all want to see on CD, which was unforgettably and indelibly beautiful."
1,Utter disappointment,"Gosh was I happy to have found the Missa Luba again! I heard it first in the 60s and fell in love with it - with the vibrance, the aliveness, the depth of feeling and colour of it. It brought back memories of the time when I heard 40 or so (black) workers in South Africa, singing on their way home from work, and that still is the most beautiful singing I've ever heard. And being a singer myself, I've heard a lot!And then I listen to the examples: the whole thing has fallen flat on it's face. What a pale, watered-down, emotionless version this is! Like the others: I'll wait till Philips comes to its senses!"
3,The air went out of my ballon.,"For years, I had looked for The Missa Luba on CD. Found it. This is not the Missa Luba I have loved for so many years. It lacks the simple passion of the original. The joy is gone. In reading the other reviews, I am happy to see that others are also calling for a re-release of the original on CD."
3,Revisiting Missa Luba 40 Years Later . . .,"As a person familiar at first hand with the original recording of Missa Luba in the Congo of the early 1960s, I can recall the excitement throughout the world at the original arrangement and recording. This rendition by the National Choir of Kenya (have been there often as well) is welcomed, and evocative of the African spirit, but is VERY DIFFERENT in arrangment, tempo and fervor from the original Phillips recording of the early 1960s. If at all possible, I urge a purchase of THIS version, AS WELL AS a re-release of the Phillips original!!"
1,Cultural imperialism,"I listened to excerpts of this souless example of cultural imperialism. The original 1968 version was alive, breathing, filled with passion and beauty. It also showed how even the brutality Congo suffered under the Belgians can be transcended, and a white church made genuinely universal by suffering. Christ does become the expression of liberation after enslavement in the original version. This commodified dreck merely turns the music into a saleable item. Phillips should be boycotted until they bring the origianl out. I have CDs of Debussy's music recorded in the 1920s and it is a joy to the ear. It isn't the music quality that counts (to everyon but the turd ears in marketing), but the music. The music is what is liberating."
5,A haunting rendition of the Roman Catholic Mass.,"I first became aware of this album when it was released in 1969 as the sound track for a Cannes film festival winner titled ""If"". The music has stayed with me since that time and I have worn out the 33rpm release long ago. This is a must for those looking for a refreshing rendition of the Latin mass."
2,You must hear the original Missa Luba!!,"I first heard Missa Luba, when I was about eight. Living in the suburbs, My godfather brought it to us, after his stint in Mwanza,with the White Fathers. I had never heard anything that made me shiver, with the force of some divine light.And to hear the voices!!Glorious and more. I thought, ""this is what God sounds like"". I looked for the original for years, when the record got lost. The modern versions of this are no comparison! Another reviewer here lists the LP #, so I urge you to get it."
1,Not nearly what I thought,I listened to the Missa Luba on NPR when I was in high school. It was good enough for me to keep looking for a copy for 30 years. This is not the same version or nearly as good. Don't buy it.
3,Revisiting Missa Luba after Forty Years ! ! !,"As a person familiar at first hand with the original Philips recording of Missa Luba in the early 1960s, I welcome this re-recording on CD, but must caution all that it is vastly different in tone, tempo and fervor from the original. Still inspirational, still African, but somehow restrained and more ""formal"". The other songs on the CD are different also. I urge individuals interested in this title to buy it, AND to urge Phillips to re-release the original version from the early 1960s. It swept the Catholic world and can do so again!"
2,Second-rate,"This recording is pretty - and that's the problem. It is a pale imitation of the original Missa Luba Philips released on LP. There's little of the original emotion, excitement and exuberance of the early release; it just comes off as pretty and bland. This is a classic example of a record company not understanding either its holdings or its customers. Philips obviously decided that a ""new"" stereo version was more saleable that the original, even though the reputation of the original was solid. Yet another sad case of merchandising gone wrong."
2,Where's the Original?,"I still have the original vinyl version, which is a wonderful recording. I bought this version about a year ago and was severly disappointed. I just checked back in to see if maybe they had released the original on CD. Guess not. This version does not come close to replacing it!"
1,A pale shadow of the original,"Others have already made this point, but I will repeat it. The orginal Missa Luba was a work of great genius. This version is the processed-cheese equivalent. It is musically competent, but sterile and ultimately boring. I can only guess that those who rate it highly have never heard the original, which I have the privilege of owning on LP. If you can't find the original version it might be worth your money to buy this one, but only because it gives an echo of the brilliant original."
2,What a disappointment,"This new version does not have even 10 percent of the raw power of the original. I first listened to Missa Luba on LP as a student. It was the most striking and shattering musical experience I had ever encountered. Now everything is watered down and the ""pretty"" sound of the female choir is so thin and tame. It's like elevator music with an African bent. If you have ever listened to the original, don't waste your money on this one unless you are dying for nostalgia."
3,Missa Luba,"A wonderful recording that is well worth hearing again and again. However, this rendition does not possess the power, drive, energy or haunting beauty of the original Phillips release of the 1960's. I own the original on vinyl and strongly urge a re-release on CD."
2,composition,"This book has a lengthy rambling introduction!!!!!! The content by autor is good but when I got both this book and composition - understanding line, notan and color --- guess what it's the same content. The other book (by the same author) is much cheaper and without the rambling introduction."
2,Don't waste your money,I want composition that I can understand and deal with in my painting everday. I don't care at all to read the long intorduction offered. Thanks but no thanks
1,"Arthur Wesley Dow ""Composition""","I've never chucked a book out before in my life, but this one I did. The basic writings by Arthur Wesley Dow are very good, however the introduction written by Joseph Masheck occupied most of the books pages in a stilted language that was obviously written to put a check in one of this person's achedemic requirements boxes. It got me so riled that I had paid considerably for Dows comments and got Mashecks voluminous dribble, that I cut out the introduction with a razor blade and kept the small informative portion by Dow. If you're impressed with disjointed, convoluted, achedemic banter, buy it, you'll love it."
1,A horrible edition of a real classic,Joseph Masheck's review has no place in this book.Get the new Dover edition *without* the intro.
2,Disapppointing version of a classic,"This particular version of the classic on Composition is reduced in size and therefore very hard to read. Picture examples, essential to the text, are fuzzy and of poor quality; no color for the color section. Spend a bit more money and get the""Composition: Understanding Line, Notan and Color"", by the same author. It is the same book with a different title."
3,cheaper version available,"The Arthur Dow book published by Dover under a slightly different title is the same main text - minus the intro - at less than half the price.Composition: Understanding Line, Notan and Color"
1,Poor Book Construction,"This book is printed on lightweight Oak Tag. So heavy and stiff are the pages that they broke from the binding within two minutes of trying to pry open the book. Dow's own work should have been included, not the tedious introduction. Someone needs to do this book over properly."
5,"Glidelighter PenAgain Highlighter, Chisel Tip, Orange",I have not had a highlighter I could use (since I feel / severe brain injury) in just about 5 years.
2,Not Much in this one,It is often accurately said that a bad ending will hurt even a good story. In this case it is a mediocre story and the ending did nothing but hurt it. This one has little to recommend it and you'd be better off passing it up.
4,Pudge Ate a Prophet,I enjoyed this book from the cover to the end. The illustrations were extremely colorful. The prospective of Pudge was one I had never thought of before this book. The fact that everyone is important... even a Big Fish. The good feelings that a child can take away from this story and feel that they are important to God and His work are great. I would recommend this everyday but also as a self esteem booster.
2,"Decent attempt at a B-movie, yet failed harshly","When I was in the process of watching this movie, I only hoped it would live up to some great B-movies like Dead Alive or Deadly Advice. While this movie really tried, it was missing some elements. First of all, I wasn't afraid or even in some small fear of the monsters. Though they killed a few people, they didn't do it like other monsters would. I don't mean to sound psychopathic, but one key element to sci-fi/horror is fear."
5,"Fascinating short stories, excellent entertainment","A collection of short stories, by 1998 Hugo Award winner Bill Johnson. What a great reading, be it just before bedtime or on a sunny summer afternoon. Stories from a variety of background settings, always entertaining, stimulating, challenging. Enough for the borderline-hardcore sci-fi afficionado(""Meet me at apogee"")- which I am not, something for the parents (both ""Evelyn's children"" and ""One quiet night""), and of course the most exciting piece at last, the award winner ""Let's drink a fish together"". Those of you not familiar with Dakota's local rituals and practices - such as I - may wonder how you drink a fish, but while the notion is not one for the untrained palate, it is certainly a interesting one for the un-initiated. Fine holiday fun, as my kids would say."
1,Scanned version for Kindle,"This is the first Kindle version for PC that I've downloaded with the book having had pages scanned in. The quality of the scans were from the early 90's, horrible artifact. The text was extremely small (even when enlarged) an very light (no contrast). Some of the images appeared so light they seemed to be bleeding through from the reverse side of the scanned page.If you need the book, my advise is to purchase the book and not the downloaded version."
4,Andis Clippers,"I've only had the clippers for a few days and only used them for short periods of time, but so far they are great. They're light weight and easy to handle. This is my first time clipping my dog, and I'm very nervous. But the clippers are really nice."
5,The Quintessential Tool for All Who Love Poodles with a Passion!,"This book is a thorough compendium of the poodle breed, including its history, the history of poodle grooming and how to groom. It covers everything, the do-it-yourselfer and professional groomer alike, wants to know, and more! Grooming instruction and tips are reinforced by many clear cut illustrations, photos and helpful charts. Individual poodle styles and necessary supplies are shown; then followed by photos of the expected results. I'm a self-taught home groomer (I have trimmed my own poodles for years) but would not groom again without it! It has become a valuable, indispensable tool and reference, next to my grooming kit! I highly recommend this Poodle grooming ""Bible"" to all poodle-passionate pros and non-professionals alike! It is so well worth the cost!"
5,the gold standard in poodle grooming,"If you groom poodles, this ought to be your bible. Heavily illustrated and up-to-date, the author provides detailed information on making the poodle look its best. Topics include bathing; tools, supplies, and equipment; hygiene and health; analyzing the dog against AKC standard to determine suitable styles; disguising conformation flaws; scissoring techniques; step-by-step clipping instructions; trends; grooming competitions; and European clips.I bought the book when I decided to take on grooming my own poodle. It provides all the information I need to proceed with some measure of confidence."
4,A reader's opinion,This is the second time I have bought this book since I offeredthe first one to my son. An excellent introduction to the topic!
5,Insghtful and powerful,"Family Secrets provides powerful tools for understanding the dynamics of families, and understanding how you may have become unknowingly enmeshed in patterns that can persist for generations.The most valuable parts of the book are the techniques for uncovering family secrets, and the method for bringing all the information together in such a way that it makes sense. These techniques are practical and really work. I made several major discoveries about families I am involved with as a result of this book.Bradshaw includes many new insights about how families work throughout the book.Overall, highly recommended."
3,"Dee Lundgren, licensed professional counselor",I agree with the premise that our family secrets have a direct bearing on who we are today as people. I am not sure it is necessary to go back and try to figure out what the actual secret was to heal. It has been my experience that trying to figure your parents out may be a task in futility. Clients can become fixated on why their parents did what they did and this can again put their healing in the hands of their parents. It is however important to recognize that children often do select mates that attempt to met those unmet needs of our childhood. Often our mates have the exact issues that we need to work out with our parents. It is brought out in the book that we choose what is familiar and therefore choose poorly if we have unresolved issues from our past. The book does a good job of helping the reader to understand the power of family secrets.
3,Death in June unplugged.,"I thought this was a sort of a let-down. The live show performed by just 2 people. With such minimalistic setting (no DAT used) DIJ's stuff loses very much of its haunting mysterious atmosphere. The new versions of 5 tracks on Zagreb Studio EP sound pretty much the same as on the live CD, maybe a bit more refined. I found the versions of ""Fall Apart"" and ""The Golden Wedding of Sorrow"" rather enjoyable yet not as great as the originals. Get it if you really like Death in June. If you just wonder what they sound like live however, get Heilige!"
2,OK,Douglas P was proud to enounce that DIJ were one of the first bands to appear in the former Yugoslavia after the war. Bet they were cheered up no end.
3,Battery power,"Can someone tell me which Digital camera is the least power hog. I have a PDC 700 now and can't believe how much of battery power it devours. Brand new 4 AA Duracell batteries will last 2 hours, and if I use new E batteries, will last about half a day, I also use rechargeable batteries but still not long enough to last all day. I am looking for a digital camera that I do not have to remove batteries when I am not using it, it's such a hassle. In that case why don't digital camera manufacturers include a pouch with their cameras for consumers to use. I am thinking about getting PDC PDC 2300Z but after reading what Carol Kladis said about the batteries, "" It's very important to always remove the batteries when not in use, as these cameras soak them up fast."", I am not too sure now.Anyone has any suggestions?Thanks!"
3,does not work on xp,"Can't get it to work on my computer which has the XP operating system. The software cannot see the camera via the USB port. Anyone know if there are any patches available for download? Also tried it on Windows 98SE - still does not see camera. Takes great shots, easy to use, but cannot download pictures. Anyone else have these problems?"
1,This program is flawed,"This program has a lot of bugs in it. It has the tendency to crash your system. In addition, some of the answers are not correct. There are much better programs out there- save your money."
1,"(price), usage rights, and reliance on a dot com?","ok, so let me get this straight... the Cevia web site is a critical component of this frame functioning, even after paying $$$ for it? Without a guarantee that the Cevia site will be alive in 12 months? And every picture I send, Polaroid gets world-wide rights to without asking my permission?Tell ya what.. you pay me $5K for the frame and ($price)for each picture, and the requirement that you ask me prior to use of an image and I'll *reconsider* this product. The marketing bozo who whipped this one up should practice this phrase.. ""would you like paper or plastic?""."
4,Mom Likes It,"Seems only people that don't like something write a review. Personally, I like the frame. I KNEW it could only be used with an $8 a month service over the Internet BEFORE I bought it. The service is easy to use and so is the frame. My Mother doesn't have to do anything to get 20 pictures a day sent to her. I have uploaded 200+ photos and 20 new ones randomly appear every morning. They can use any picture I send for what ever they want - I don't care! Hell, maybe I'll become so popular that my face will become a commodity and some one will call me for a $$million$$ contract! (yeah-right) There are several other options one the service, like sending photos on a certain day, locking certain photos so they stay on the frame, etc. My mother lives 1,500 miles from me and has no computer or computer knowledge, so this works very nicely. My brother can also send photos, as can anyone else I am willing to give my password to."
5,Guard Your Refrigerator - The Pirates Have Arrived!,"Pirate Bender ""Swab"" springs to life when you free him! I purchased several of these great little benders for my 10 year old Granddaughter. She cleaned off the refrigerator and it was immediately invaded by pirates!"
2,Clea DuVall is the only reason for the stars,"This movie really sucked. It was boring and predictable, and it had some REALLY corny lines. The only good thing about it was Clea DuVall in a small part as Jessica Lane. Even though she had some cheesy dialogue to work with, I think she handled it pretty well. If you're going to see it, don't buy it, rent it."
5,No comparison with a less expensive machine,"Easier to turn, smooth, and doesn't leave little 'tracks' when material is rolled through. Very well made- this is my fourth pasta machine and I think this one will hold up better than the others. So far so good!"
1,Not for previous Palm or Pocket PC users,I purchased this book after being disappointed by the documentation that came with the HP iPAQ. I have finished the book in about 45 minutes and did not learn anything other than I could write over my notes in Transcriber without having to wait. It did not make me a PowerUser and able to do everything with my iPAQ. It seemed more like a manual for a Jornada that was formed into a book than anything.Might be good for basic novices.
1,dont know,cant really say either way cause i havent received it yet....must still be on backorder....hopefully i will be able to get it soon plz
4,Easy to swallow,"I love these vitamins because they're thinner than most prenatal vitamins and they're coated which makes them super easy to swallow. The only drawback is they're expensive. However since swallowing big pills is a huge issue for me, it's worth the extra money."
2,Not One Of The Better S.K. Movies,Don't Expect much from this movie. If You have nothing better to do take a peek.
5,Hitman's Run,"This an older Eric movie but an excellent one. I've owned it for years and been an Eric Roberts fan for as long as I can remember. He puts all he can into his movies. I think he deserves a lot of credit for his acting.Anyone who likes Eric and lots of action with very interesting characters will love this one.I recommended it highly. I intend to buy a few of his newer ones.Best wishes to Eric Roberts, a fine actor indeed.Addendum: LEAVING LAS VEGAS AND WRONG NUMBER ARE NOT TRUE ERIC MOVIES. THIS IS."
4,A typical Jayne Ann Krentz book to enjoy,"I have always looked forward to Jayne Ann Krentz's novels andthis one is no exception. It may not have been her best (like GrandPassion) but I still enjoyed it a lot. Garrett Coltrane is JAK's typical hero, a very male person with a chip on his shoulder. He needed to marry Katy Randall to polish up his business image, whereas Katy married him because she loved him. However, Katy had cold feet on the night of the wedding, and suffice to say, both Katy and Garrett had to undergo a period of really getting to know one another. Of course, in the true JAK tradition, there is a mystery to be solved in the process..... An enjoyable read for a free weekend when nobody interrupts me. END"
3,3 1/2 stars,"This is NOT JAK at her best but neither is it her worst. Katy starts to get bridal jitters right after the wedding but I never quite understood how she and Garrett came to be in that situation. It seemed there was almost no communication of a personal nature between them before the wedding. But that doesn't jibe with Katy's personality. The Katy we see in the book would have darn well gotten her declaration of love before she married Garrett. So it was hard for me to swallow that Katy would all the sudden freak out after the wedding night. It made Katy look like a total idiot. But once you get past that the book isn't too bad as long as you can handel Garrett's alpha male, condescending attitude."
5,One of Krentz's best works,This is one of my favorites by Jayne Ann Krentz. She does a wonderful job of creating sexual tension between the characters and deftly expresses the clueless nature of the hero. An entertaining story to relax and enjoy.
3,"Not as listed-is actually dl-alpha acetate-synthetic, NOT natural","I guess this is okay, even though it was not what they listed for sale. The description lists it as d-alpha, and it's actually dl-alpha acetate, which is synthetic. dl-alpha is quite inferior to the d-alpha, so I guess you get what you pay for. For $2.50 I am not going to bother with returning it."
3,Heavy split fins...,Heavy split fins. Not as good as their closed heal versions. The toe is not open and is made of hard plastic. Not comfortable on the foot at all. Requires a lot of effort to propel yourself along.
2,Soap Pump,I am very disappointed in this soap pump. The pump works fine and looks Ok but it is rusting already where the lid meets the body of the pump. I would think that it would be made out of a material that does not rust since liquid soap is put into it and it's near a sink where there is obviously going to be water. I would not recommend this product. I will be looking for something else to replace it.
2,you get what you pay for,This dispenser works and the size is good for a bathroom but it rusts instantly. The bottom leaves rust rings on my sink and anywhere soap touches the outside of it are little rust spots. Not worth it.
3,Rusting!,"This is supposed to be stainless steel, but it is rusting after just a couple months. Guess i should have gone with a more expensive option!"
1,Do Not Buy This,"Item looks fine and works well-enough but the rust around the screw-cap and openings is endless and very time-consuming to clean. Inner bottles are plastic, if that matters. You won't like this item."
5,My favorite Fat Album,"I have every Fat Wreck Chords Album, and each one is great to listen to. I was impressed that Fat has so many quality bands on their label. Of all their comps, though, I believe this one is the best. Just about every song is catchy, particularly both Snuff songs and Screeching Weasel's ""Cool Kids"", and no song is so annoying that I skip it. Also, ""Olive Me"" by NOFX and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes cover of ""Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard"" really give this album clout. If you do not buy this CD at least get another fat album, because they are the best punk comps available."
4,A pretty darn good CD,"A pretty decent CD. Not quite as good as some previous fat stuff, but still good.There are some great bands on it, but its more quanity of quality if you ask me. But its worth the 4 bucks.Buy this CD its worth it!"
1,IT'S AN EXTREME CHALLENGE TO SIT THROUGH THIS MESS,"EXPERT FIGHTERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD FACE EACH OTHER IN A MARTIAL ARTS TOURNAMENT. THE WINNER WILL RECEIVE $5 MILLION. MOVIES LIKE THIS GIVE MARTIAL ARTS MOVIES A BAD NAME. THE STORY IS VERY CLICHE'D, ALL THE FIGHTS ARE BORING, THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE, AND IF YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT, THE MOVIE'S JUST PLAIN STUPID! ... TRUST ME, YOU'RE BETTER OFF LEAVING THIS ONE ON THE SHELF."
1,Un-compelling,"With due respect to the earlier reviewer, I found this movie thin and uninteresting.Well, there is I guess with any movie of this type a supposed story line to keep you entertained throughout, but if there was I missed it very early in!College situ movies need pace and dynamics, none of that here. I need not concern about giving any 'spoiler' as there's not enough substance in the script to enable this. As a TV Soapie I may have been a tad more forgiving.Fine actors and well photographed in this Blu-ray, but a shame that the presentation didn't live up to the quality."
4,"What a Wild & Crazy Dick (Detective, That is)!!","That's what we called 'em, sweetheart.Carl Reiner and Steve Martin put together a collage of films from the 1940s and 1950s, along with a silly script that could have come out of the melodramatic film noir of the time. The dialogue meshed perfectly with the old clips they used to make a somewhat coherent, funny story.Steve tries to solve the murder of a girl's father and while looking, find love, murder, bullets being sucked out of shoulders and other silly stuff.They run into many stars of the period: Alan Ladd, Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck, Burt Lancaster, Jimmy Cagney, Joan Crawford: Like 19 different stars of the time.Steve dressing as a blonde and getting picked up by Fred McMurray in a grocery store (Double Indemnity) was especially funny.Rent this today!"
3,"Good, with reservations","Most of the things that are good about this movie have been well-covered by previous reviewers and I heartily endorse the view that this a must-see for devotees of 1940s film noir. A few other points can be made, however.1. Rachel Ward is a knock-out. A true latter-day Marilyn Maxwell.2. As a general rule, directors should stay behind the camera. Carl Reiner should have followed this rule. He is funny as a butler but falls flat as a Nazi. The ending could have been so much better if Reiner had scaled-down his role and used, for example, clips from Vincent Sherman's 1942 ""All through the night"".3. The image is not true ""black and white"", but de-colourised colour. This is a minor point and probably only matters if you see the movie in a cinema.4. The DVD description of ""1.85:1 widescreen"" does not accord with modern terminology. The presentation is actually ""letterbox"" and what you see is a 1.85:1 image in a 4:3 frame."
3,"A great concept, but the rest of the film can't compete","When Steve Martin schmoozes with the great stars in the great film noirs, this movie is wonderfully entertaining. You get to watch Steve interview Jimmy Cagney in prison (WHITE HEAT), make out with Fred McMurray (DOUBLE INDEMNITY), suffer through Bette Davis' stale toast (DECEPTION), and give Edward Arnold a puppy (JOHNNY EAGER). If you have knowledge of these old films, it's even funnier. But away from these little miracles of editing the movie tends to drag and Martin's humor is sometimes a bit off and inappropriate for a noir parody. Still, if you haven't seen it, you need to check it out."
2,Uneventful and Boring.,"Could not watch the whole movie. Senseless, simply intolerable. Probably of interest for Steve Martin's fans only."
5,One of Martin's best.,Extremely funny every time I watch it. Steve Martin and Rachel Ward are a perfect match for this detective spoof. END
5,carl fan,What do you need to know other than the presence of Carl Reiner as either or both of actor and director. The interweaving between this movie and the old film clips used are fantastic and right on the money. Did I mention star Steve Martin? Nuff said.
3,You Don't Deserve a Puppy,"That is one of the rejoinders Steve Martin makes to the villain of this piece (whom he has offered a dog as a peace gesture), and although I first saw it 20 years ago it's a phrase that has worked its way into my family's lexicon as an all-purpose rebuke. Generally I don't like movies about movies but Steve Martin makes this one special, and after 20 years still memorable."
4,Everyone should be a Fred!,"A fast, short and to the point book on why, how and the importance of being a Fred. Always doing more will set you apart from the rest. Many examples given and lots to learn from this little book. Very worth the read no matter who or where you are in life."
3,Damaged,When it arrived it was damaged. They just threw it in the box without protection. It rattled around in the box till all the corners broke off and it cracked.The company was good about the refund. I did not want another one. Figured they would do the same.
5,AMAZING BOOK THAT'LL KEEP YOU READING TILL THE END!!!,"Fantastically written book with many twists and turns and an AMAZING surprise ending. I agree with the ""READER FROM HOUSTON"", I'D REALLY LOVE TO SEE A MOVIE OF THIS ONE!!!"
3,Given as a gift,I did not read it...I gave it as a gift with other Harold Robbins books. It came on time and in the condition described.
5,just like home,stories just like mine and so real! Kids will be kids and these really were normal kids. A wonderful book of stories.
4,"good times, hard times","I grew up in a rural area, hearing stories about The Depression from older friends and relatives. It is now 2005 and in the last 6 years I have read one book, Sibling Reveries. It was co-authored by the father of a co-worker, and it is one of the best books I have ever read. The story is about the Killinger family, friends, and relatives, growing up in Northern Wisconsin during the Depression. Life was much harder then, but also more carefree. To me it was like a combination of The Waltons, Andy of Mayberry, and Huck Finn. I highly recommend this book (and I would read it again........but I only read one book every 6 years;)"
4,Let's Review: Math B,"I purchased this book at the begining of the school year for all of my Math B students. I like the book very much - the explanations are very clear and concise with none of the wordy paragraphs found in other books. However, the book has many typographical errors which are very frusting to find in a math book. I hope they come out with a reprint!"
3,no probs here,"i bought this camera a few days ago and already put it through its paces,i have had no problems with picture quality for a [reasonably priced} camera,it doe's blur when someone moves as do most really [ reasonably priced]i bought it only for personal use to take pics of family and friends and it doe's me finei took a few pics at max res and they came out very good in my opinnion.like i say for a [reasonably priced] cam it does the job, but if your looking for the semi pro cams then you'll pay closer to [money amount] or moreso basically it all depends what you want to use the camera for"
1,Try again!,"I got this camera for Christmas. The intent was to take pictures of my two small children to e-mail to their Grandparents back in the US (we're a military family stationed overseas). HA!Pictures taken in a well-lit room with the auto flash on turned out too white in the light areas and too black in the dark areas. My son's face turned out blue. Yes, BLUE! The software the camera comes with doesn't have the right options to correct these errors.I was embarrased to send the pictures I took back home. We're returning it tomorrow and getting something else!"
1,1 star is not low enough,"I have had this so called camera for 4 months, tried every possible setting to stop an over exposed light condition. This causes faded pictures. No wonder Polaroid is going broke. This may have a flash, but it is totally worthless. I have a cheap intel CS630 that will take great pictures, just point and shoot."
5,LOVE THIS CAMERA!,"I've owned this camera for 3 yrs and am buying 2 more of them today for my children and their families. It is SO VERY easy to use and is perfect for a biginner. It takes BEAUTIFUL pictures that I e-mail to my family and post on the web. I let my grandchildren use it all they wanted while they were here on vacation (ages 7 to 11) and when they left and I looked at the pictures they took, I found that I have some of the most memorable vacation pictures ever!!!! You can't beat this camera for the price, the ease of use, and the quality of pictures!"
2,A good camera for 1999,"One word: banding. The camera takes great pictures in sunlight, but if you have to use the flash about half the time you get banding which looks like lines in the picture. Not much can be done about it, that and the tiny 640x480 images (which remind me of picturebooth shots) make it a great camera for the year 1999. I would spend the extra $30-$100 bux and get something with bigger shots and 1.3 mpixel. In the cameras defense I bought it refurbished, but it was probably refurbished for the above reasons. If you're looking for something cheap, you can find 1.3 mpixel cameras now for the same price."
1,Why make it complicated?,Operating this camera has been the most frustrating experience I have ever encountered. I am ready to send it to the garbage can. The settings do not make any sense at all. You pick and choose settings all day long and never get a clear picture from it. It will not take a decent picture at all.My entire reason for wanting a digital camera was to own one for myself to learn how to use it and to buy one for my daughter and son-in-law. Christmas of 2001 was the big camera day. Thanks Santa! The kids have now moved to Germany from North Carolina and they are expecting their first baby and my first grand baby. I can not even get a picture on line of my daughter. Never been more upset over a purchase in my entire life. I will not buy another Polaroid Camera of any kind. No Thank You!
3,Bleahhhhhh!,"I don't like it when you buy an item online and it comes different than pictured! The shirt no longer has the paw print on the back of the collar area. No biggie but a pain to return so I'll live with it. My three Labradors said bleahhhhhhhh,plhptttttttttt and nahhhhhhhhh!"
2,Wrong fabric,"I loved everything about the shirt(fit, lace, length) and received many compliments while wearing it. However, the shirt was made of fabric that picked up every particle of lint within a twelve mile radius and was, unfortunately, black. I stopped wearing it after only a few times due to this problem.Were the shirt made of another fabric. I would purchase it again."
4,"""Intrigue On The Hill""","This is the second novel of Ms. Winters' that I have read and I have to say that I liked it. It was slow in the beginning and the chapters were long, but the more I read the more I wanted to know how things turned out. The characters were interesting and the storyline was good. The love scenes between Skye and Darren ....HOT-HOT-HOT!!!Good novel."
5,Great CD!,"I never would have known about this woman if a friend of mine from NY hadn't seen her in clubs and told me about her. Her lyrics are so wise and wonderful you wonder how this could be coming out of someone in her 20's! Melody line is great too. However, I'm not sure I would call this ""folk"" music anymore than I would Sarah MacClaughlan's."
3,Better books out there,"There are much better books out there. I bought this book because it discusses both the parallel port and the serial port. Many of the other books give you several projects to use for experiments. This book only has one project. I wish more pages had been used to cover interfacing the PC with other ADC/DAC chips. Ciruits that are easy for the novice understand and assemble. The source code is not include on disk or CD, and all of the source is in Pascal. Perhaps using Basic or C would be better. Ideally, source and executables would be great. In general, I did not learn much from this book."
5,hot diggity,"I'm not an Electronics Engineer, but I feel very comfortable with this book. I learned my electronics over 30 years ago. So my knowledge is weak, dated, to say the least. However, I've tried to keep an interest in electronics. I come from an industrial background. I'm accustomed to building power plants, refineries, etc. Then came PC's. Well I waited until the 486 came out. Anything less was a joke. Now I want to connect everything to my PC. This book is just right for me. I took refresher courses at the local college to ""bone_up"" a bit on my antiquated electronics. I'm not a PROGRAMMER either, but the programming in this book is done already. I think it could be scanned....Whoops!"
2,Rust right away,Check to make sure this is dishwasher safe. i did not. I just assumed it was. After about 2 washes the knives began to rust in spots. I was very disappointed:( I have had it for about a month maybe less and they are already ready to be thrown out.
1,these knives used to be great!,"My grandfather bought these knives almost ten years ago and they were left to me when he passed away. My former landlord stole them from me or else I would have never needed to replace them! I still have one of the #14's and as I inspect it closer, the handle says 'Showtime 6 star', is much better quality and still looks new! I saw the infomercial and didn't even think twice about ordering these knives to replace what I had. Buy one get one free cost me $150 in shipping and for the blocks. I was looking forward to receiving these knives, I just couldn't wait to cut stuff up! How disappointing to receive this inferior product... Plastic handles and flexible blades... Are they serious? They told me I'd get a refund after calling twice..I guess I'll just have to wait and see... Honestly, I can't even have these knives in my house any longer... It's infuriating!"
1,As cheap as it gets,"Wow never seen such junk as these knives. The hard plastic handles are screwed on under the silver tone plastic rivets which you will see when the rivets fall out, the screws are all rusted. The plastic handles are falling off and move around, they get water in between the plastic and the metal tangs which drips out when you wash them. The plastic is hollow so you can literally shake the water out of the handle. They rust like crazy and I have never put them in the dishwasher. Sharp at first but dull quickly. Made in China."
1,Not even worth 1 star!,"These knives SUCK! I really wished I had read reviews from Amazon instead of the stock reviews on the Ronco website. Otherwise, I would have NEVER wasted the money on these waste-of-precious-space-on-my-teeny-counter knives. Every one of these knives is dull. Even after a run through with the ""sharpener"" that was included with the set. And no, I have not utilized the Ronco ""FREE REPLACEMENT KNIVES FOR LIFE GUARANTEE"", as I don't want to replace knives with more knives that will just dull the minute I slice into a tomato. That's all. My two cents. Thank you for listening."
2,RONCO 25-pc knife set,"25-PIECE KNIFE SET: Although the infomercial says you get 2 sets for the price of one, RONCO is charging another $40 bucks for the shipping/handling on these LIGHTWEIGHT knives, sooooo, you're paying for BOTH sets when you buy from RONCO. Don't be fooled by their infomercial....you're NOT getting a free set of anything! As for the ""lifetime"" guarantee....you have to pay a fee, per knife, for that to be covered also. The knives don't hold up, so don't expect them to last very long."
4,Inexpensive great knife set,"I see the point of other reviews on the knife handle. I do have to say though that these knives came sharpenned and ready to use. I was extremely impressed with the product and how smooth they cut. Cut my steak like butter. Highly recommend. Love Amazon, although I bought them at Target. No butcher block, bought that seperate through Amazon. Great set for the inexpensive price!!!!"
2,You get what you pay for!,I was looking for a set of steak knives and came across the infomercial one night. It sounded great and much cheaper then the Henckels of the world. And look at all the different types of knives. NOT WORTH IT. These knives don't cut well at all. I wish I didn't buy it and just purchased a couple of good quality knives.
1,Junk Handles,Knives are OK but handles are JUNK. Black plastic shrinks and cracks in the dishwasher resulting in tang rivets that come loose and fall out leaving a rusty hole. I have had this happen to six knives already. It costs more to return them than they are worth. Buy some other brand like a Ginsu!
4,good for the price,you get a lot of knives for what you pay but there is a tradeoff. the quality is suspect for longterm use. right now the knives are very sharp and are holding up well. the very lightweight and thin design make one believe the life of these are short. I do run these knives throught the washer (which the instructions say you can do) and I noticed a little rust on the one steak knife. I stated to wash by hand at this point. like i started with these are very good for the price but i have questions about the longevity of them.great for a set on a low budget.
1,"BUYER BEWARE,JUNK,CHEAP,RIP OFF, DO NOT WASTE HARD EARNED MONEY.......","MR RONCO, YOU NEED TO STOP SHOWING THESE KNIVES ON YOUR INFOMERCIAL. THEY ARE NOT WORTH THE BOX THEY CAME IN. I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT YOU ADVERTISE BECAUSE THESE KNIVES ARE JUNK AND CAN ONLY BE INDICATIVE OF THE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT YOU SELL.I NEVER USED THEM.......... I OPENED THE BOX AND SAW A BUNCH OF SCRAP METAL AND NOW THAT BOX IS READY FOR THURSDAYS TRASH PICKUP."
4,These are very good knives for the price!,"over Two years ago i bought these knives form the Ronco company itself.At that time i got two sets. I sent one for my chef sister in Antigua She loved them.She use them alot more than I and the words are still printed on the knives.i must say these knives are just as good. My only problem is the no. 15 paring knife the handle crack then after broke. but with the warranty it was replaced. My sister is a professional chef in the U.S Army and she has the boning knife and the clever in her bag set. she replaced them with the cutco two hundred plus knife she had. i cook almost every day and except for the minor problem with one of the smallest knife my set is fine. I am West Indian and we cook alot. I had to cut through frozen meat, slice fish and its perfect each time.the chop and serve and the clever is the most used knives and they are well built. So for the price they are good investments.Almost 3 years and still going strong."
1,Garbage!,"I didn't have a knife set when I moved out so I bought into the whole infomercial thing and purchased the set. Yes they are very cheap in quality. The knives became dull instantly and I tried to use their sharpener... it doesn't sharpen! Worst knife sharpener I have ever seen! I just tried using their sharpener on their utility knife for 20 minutes and in the end, didn't remove any hairs from my arm. I'm never listening to another infomercial again!!WHAT A PIECE OF ....!!!!"
1,ronco knives,"Thanks for taking the time and sharing your comments, we almost got sucked in with the infomercial but thank God I looked at these comments first. They mention on the infomercial that these are German made, but in reality they are made in China. Thanks again"
1,AWFUL,I ordered these directly from the company. The shipping prices are outrageous. By the time I got them it cost me double! Plus it's been over two months and I haven't gotten them all yet. But if you call them they say the order's already been processed and I should be receiving it in the next 15 to 20 business days! By the time I pay to ship them back and get a refund it won't be worth it. I think I'm going to just wrap them up and give them away at out next white elephant Christmas. These are DEFINITELY not worth it! Don't waste your money or your time.
4,Years & years of great use!,"Wow, I must have lucked out with my knives or maybe they went to crap after the fact!? I've had mine for almost 5 years now and (with the exception of the utility knife because it's used excessively & I haven't sharpened it) all knives are still sharp & intact, I can't complain! I use them quite often (except the fillet knife) and seem to have many years left in them. They do everything they say they will. I guess my only complaint would be spotting/rusting BUT I'm lazy & have put them in the dishwasher for YEARS!! The spots do rub off but it doesn't bother me enough to deal with it! I am getting ready to buy these sets for my dad, more as a ""sportsman's"" set than day-to-day use."
1,Ronco knive set,DO NOT PURCHASE. Horrible product. Had these knives for one (1) month and already rusting. Guess they are not good quality stainless steel. Stainless is not supposed to rust. Company states they will replace but need to send them $3 per knife for replacement. There should be no way the consumer should have to pay money for a defect in there product for replacement. DO NOT PURCHASE.
3,Looooove Bogart...movie OK.,"Not one of Bogart's pinnace films, but if you love him, you'll want it in your collection."
3,Only a 50's paranoia,"I am such a fan of Bogie and Wyler, but although the production is impeccable, the screenplay is so boring, and the typical ""happy 50's family"" is so square, that I was begging at the end of this feature, ""C'mon Bogie, kill'em all! Kill'em all!"".Unfortunately, he didn't."
2,"Weak on content depth & breadth, editing, cookbook approach","This was a very disappointing book.Examples are simplistic and not well thought out. There are very basic shells for doing some parsing tasks a lot of different ways, but very shallow or missing rationale for the different alternatives. It felt like the author came up with a bunch of solutions without understanding the problems XML can address. Having E-Commerce in the title is a joke that hangs on one of the recurring examples throughout the book.Numerous gramatical and content errors. The structure of the book is light as well - examples before concepts and lots of white space & big type."
2,"""Content-free Marketing Speak"" is right-on","An earlier reviewer described the book as ""content-free marketing speak"", and was right on the money, as far as I can tell. I've not delved deeply into the book, which in and of itself ought to tell you something. The book does not have obvious entry points (aside from the beginning, which left me wondering when we were going to discuss the meat of XML), and doesn't reward perusal, which I believe a good ""getting started"" or ""by example"" book should do.On top of all of that, the book was needlessly fluffed by large type and too much whitespace. Now, I understand that there are those who appreciate large type, but I was left with the same taste I got when finishing too-short term papers and cranking up the font size and linespacing.All in all, it's not worth the $40 cover price. Of course, I have yet to find a good, thorough, and well-structured ""intro"" to XML. Throw another one onto the pile."
1,So... this is what XML is?,"After about 100 pages (65 on Intro and another 35 on the ""real"" stuff) of intensive reading and another 100 of going over it, I still did not get what makes XML useful. Author praises it so much and never speaks about its downsides which are obvious even to me, a person who had never dealt with XML before. In all the examples the Microsoft Software is used, like there are no other software around. Well, I spend another 10 minutes on the CD that comes with the book - could not use any single file. At this point I quit. Hope you will not buy this... book."
3,A Good XML startup book,"The generic XML and introduction to XML, XSL etc are preseted in detail. This book deserves atleast 4 stars, but I put 3 stars because of the following reason.Eventhough this book says XML by example : Building eCommerce Applicaitons. But the eCommerce part is not handled properly. Otherwise this is a good book and has a lot information, which is available on websites. This is a good review book for those who don't want to read the stuff on the computer monitor (i.e. going to web and searching for eCommerce/OFX etc and reading the standards/documentation)."
2,A mediocre xml book with a very catchy title.,The reason I bought this book was to see how could xml help in creating e-commerce or e-tailor sites.The author explains xml but is never able to tie it concretely to e-commerce applications. The latter half of the book is straight copies of information on web-sites.What I wanted to know was why I should use xml to create an e-tailor website as opposed to using the usual 3-tier database-html approach. This book was not able to answer that question.
2,fluffy: 100 pages of content in 460 pages,"I found this book hard to read since so much of it was content-free marketing speak. Also, the book has little to do with ecommerce. By the time the book finally gets to HTML generation, it glosses over and says ""[well, most vendors like to keep their techniques secret]""."
1,There are no useful examples!,"This book fails to deliver in almost every aspect. The front cover promises ""Build XML e-commerce applications start to finish"", this is entirely misleading. A more accurate title would be ""XML syntax and some vague examples"". Do not buy this book."
2,Best of all worst XML books,I was greatly disappointed with the contents of this book and above all after learning that the editor is the one who invented SGML(Mother of XML)...they should think a hundred times before writing this kinda books. Please stop circulating this book in the market. Why are you people giving wrong information to people???
2,"little more than a ""gee-whiz"" book for non-techies","Others have already said it better than I, so I'll keep this short:* not enough information to be useful* poor presentation of the details* it only babbles on and on about how great XML is, without telling you anything about any pitfalls or, for example, the shortcomings of DTDs.Charles Goldfarb should actually look at these books, before lending his name to them.If you want the real deal, go with the Wrox Press book: Professional XML. Sure, it's big, weighs a ton, and you'll probably never need to look at more than a third of it, but I swear even just the first 4 chapters are worth the price of the entire book!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a worthless book. The title is completely misleading; very little useful information is presented in the book. Most of the examples on the CD have errors and do not work. Size of the book is only an indication of how many trees were killed. If this book is any indication of the quality of Goldfarb series, I am not buying any other books from the Goldfarb series; these guys are only out to make money for themselves. Shame on the author and Charles Goldfarb. This author should be banned from writing any more books."
2,An example of disorganization,You'll spend most of your time waiting for something to happen. There is essentially no connection between the CD-ROM and the text.
1,"Gee, this book [stinks]!","I have read books about HTML, JavaScript, C++ and honestly THIS BOOK IS THE WORST that I have ever read! I wanted to learn some XML from this book, it starts talking about its capabilities, use, implementation, functionality, examples, examples, blah, blah, blah... zzzzz.If you want to learn how to use XML take my advice, do not consider this book. However, if you know XML this book has examples of how can XML be implemented, though I think it is not worth its price."
1,No details,"While XML By Example has a great introductory chapter for anyone new to XML, there is no substance to support this introduction. If you simply want an overview of what XML can do and some examples of systems that use XML, by all means purchase this book. If you want to learn XML, this book is a waste of time and money."
1,Lacks any real depth or usefulness,This book only skims around the various XML topics in a somewhat shallow manner. I was looking to understand how XML could be leveraged in real world business situations. This book did not help at all.
1,Misleading Title,"This book failed to provide the examples that I expected from a book entitled ""XML-by example.""Perhaps it provides adequate information for those interested only in learning esoteric terms and concepts, but it fails to provide the everyday developer with anything useful.Unfortunately (for me, because i could have been reading something else), the examples do not come with any meat - they are small, ""context-less"", snippets of code without any illustration of what the code actually does. very confusing for someone who doesn't want or need to spend 10 hours reading a book from cover to cover.practically useless."
1,Far too overpriced for this length!! You shouldn't spend more than $10,"Much like the previous reviewer I urge you not to spend lots of money on HDMI cables. HDMI specs state that only one pixel out of every billion can be lost, therefore there is no reason, no matter what the cable is made of, to spend money on HDMI cables.Search the internet, you can find plenty of good 10ft HDMI cables for $10 or less.Digital is zeroes and ones. In HDMI's case, either the cable is connected or it isn't."
2,false advertized!!!...not 1080P,"The product is advertized on Amazon as being for 720p, 1080i, and 1080p but the product package clearly states that it is only for 720p & up to 1080i, NOT 1080p!!!1 star for amazon1 star for cable (it works atleast at 1080i)-3 for false advertising!! by monster cable!!!!it even said 1080p on their website!!!!but they clearly needs to change their label on the packaging it says up to 1080i (NOT 1080P)"
2,BEWARE - Misleading product advertising,"The product is advertized on Amazon as being for 720p, 1080i, and 1080p but the product package clearly states that it is for 720p & 1080i, not 1080p. It works for my 1080p HDTV but no better than the simple little HDMI cable that came with my Sony NS601HP upconverting 1080p DVD player (which does an unbelievable job with standard DVD's by the way). I feel ripped off and unfortunately did not open it up and try it out and notice this until the return period had expired."
1,NOT RATED FOR 1080P!!!!!!,"The cable didn't earn the single star, Amazon did.The technical details said:""For high definition video (720p, 1080i, 1080p) or standard video formats.""This is an outright LIE! The package itself says specifically that the cable is for ""up to 1080i"". That doesn't mean this cable can't handle 1080p, I'm sure it will, I'm just angry because I bought this cable because the details said 1080p and that is what I wanted to buy."
1,dreadful!!!!!,"I just finished this book and felt compelled to throw it in the trash....the writing is stale and loaded with cliches, the plot absurdly convoluted and filled with too many coincidences, and it times it seemed like a Nancy Drew mystery wrapped in fancy Italian words...what garbage!!!SB in Boca Raton,FL"
1,Skip this book,"It's a book about a couple of twisted sicko psychopaths, with a very unsatisfying abrupt ending that left many loose ends dangling. It's as if the author got sick of writing the book and just wanted to end it. The book offered no food for thought and no interesting ideas to ponder. Pass on this worthless book. [...]"
3,Better sets of headphones out there....,"I've had the 712i headphones for about a week and I am NOT very impressed with them at all. The headphones are relatively heavy making them not very comfortable for long periods of time. The noise cancelling is great, but because of the closed cup design, it suffocates the ears making it uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour continuously. As for sound quality, again it fails to live up to it's MSRP price tag. Fortunately I was able to find these headphones for less than $40 but even that price was too much in my opinion. Instead, I would definitely recommend going with the Sennheiser HD212 or even the HD202. I have the HD212's and love those headphones. I only bought these because I wanted to see if there would be a difference in quality given the higher MSRP of these cans. There was a difference, a big negative one."
1,"Cheaply made, break easily, o.k. sound",The sound on these headphones is o.k. When using the sound isolation you will hear a mild hiss but I have found that to be commonplace on all headphones in the same price range. The main drawback on these headphones is that they are cheaply made. The bond between the two actual headphones and the semi-circular 'connector' on the top is very weak and it broke very easily on my piece within 2 months of buying it.Another big drawback is that there is the volume control and sound isolation control unit that comes attached to the headphone wires is HUGE. It is slightly bigger and more heavier than two old ipod shuffles put together and it is very irritating.I'd recommed shelling a few extra dollars and getting better and sturdier headphones.
4,Not bad!,"I got these for a pretty low price, and they've worked flawlessly for me. They came with a cloth bag for storage. The noise cancelling system works very well - no more nagging from the lady =), and it increases bass, so listening to music is a totally new experience with these headphones. They are pretty comfortable for the price, but I don't see how anyone can keep them on for more than an hour at a time. Overall though, not bad."
2,Breaks easily. Drains Battery. Background noise.,"The worst part is the 3/16"" plastic tube where the headband attaches to the earmuffs. It breaks so easily. I have broken both left and right side from dropping them on my thick carpet from 2 feet. You will break it too. I used epoxy glue to fix it but man, that part was so flimsy. I heard the guy left Altec Lansing and started designing Toyota brakes. Everything is plastic on the outside.You do have to clip the on/off battery box to youself or nearby as the cord is only 2 feet.I have replaced dozens of single AAA because I always forget to turn it off. No, I don't use a rechargeable because I already have dozens from Costco.I think it feels good though. I like the padding."
2,"Nice Backup, Not Worth The Hype","Noise Cancelling is pretty descent... but when turned on there is a defnite buzz in the background that can be annoying. If the music is loud enough it will cancel it out... but you shouldn't have to worry about that in a quality pair of headphones.They are fairly uncomfortable after any period of time.The audio overall is perhaps slightly above your average pair of headphones... but certainly nothing for an audiophile... as the base isn't great at all, and at high volumes there are definite distortions ina ll ranges.Bottom line, if you can find these for $30 or $40 it may be worth it for you and if you aren't too picky... but if you want a real noise cancelling experience, i would look elsewhere."
3,Great price - avarage product,Great price.Do the job of blocking noise on airplanMajor problem is the fact that it start annoying after an hour or less and must be removed from the ears.
5,You Don't HaveTo Be Jewish,I am extremely satisfied with The Shengold Jewish Encyclopedia and The New Jewish Encyclopedia. I suggust your customers buy both books. Each one gives varied and unique perspectives on all the subjects.
5,Her at her prime. 5 stars.,"This is a superbly written and produced ballad. About being lonely and only wanting that special person to be in your life and sharing your love with each other...Worth the price (0.01) they're asking you and definitely worth the shipping price (2.98) for a total of less than 3.00.Love you, Mariah.Cover Art: B-Songwriting: AProduction: AVocals: B+Length: B+Overall: A+"
5,Hotel Operations Management is an Outstanding Book!,"""Hotel Operations Management"" takes a comprehensive look at all aspects of hotel management. The coverage of all departments of a hotel is extensive and contemporary. The authors bring industry experience to the book making the information usable and practical. The book is extremely well-written and ""user friendly"" for anyone to read. As Chair of the Hospitality Management program at the University of North Texas, I would definitely recommend this book to my faculty who teach Hotel Operations in my program. I give this book ""5 stars!"""
3,Quick,"My package arrived quickly, but the book was in worse condition than I had anticipated. There was no description of the book, so I expected normal wear and tear, considering it was listed as used. But the book is stained on the edges, and bent up. Overall, the book will serve it's purpose (textbook) but I am unhappy."
3,Chewable Convenience but terrible taste,"I tried this product because the regular pills were huge and hard to swallow. These are convenient because they are chewable but I have to say they taste pretty terrible. I find myself skipping doses and avoiding it. There are other products available like soft chews that I will try instead. But, if you can handle the taste, these are decent. Other products seem to contain more MSM.Here are the nutrition facts from the label:Serving size - 1 wafer (take 2 per day)[20 calories, 3.5 carbohydrates, 3g sugar, 0.5g protein][glucosamine hcl - 750mg] [chondroitin sulfate - 600mg], and [MSM ""optimsm"" (methylsulfonylmethane) 100mg].[Contains soy and crustacean shellfish. ]No yeast, corn, wheat, dairy, preservatives, or artificial colors."
5,Excellent Underwater Housing,"I bought this underwater housing along with the Olympus SP-560 UZ to try my hand at underwater photography. I brought it with me on a trip to Roatan and the case was everything I would expect from Olympus. No leaks, not overly heavy, the flash diffuser is nice and the button layout is ergonomic and easy to use even with dive gloves. The pictures taken came out as well as I could hope for my first ever underwater photos (Cloudy day didn't help). I think the next thing I purchase will be the external flash to bring more colors to my photos. Overall really nice product with the ability to add to it, unlike some other U/W Housings. Would recommend if you are looking to purchase and camera and U/W housing and not break the bank."
4,Nice but bulky,"This is a real nice case for the Olympus camera, but it is bulky. The camera is not small either, but add the case to it and it is a lot to heft around to your swim and/or dive area. Have only used it to snorkel depth at this point, but it is sturdy and appears well made. Since I like all things water, I always buy Olympus camera's since they make nice underwater cases that are a value compared to Ike Lite and others. Recommended."
5,Wow!!,"Worth picking up. One of the best UW housings that I owned and/or used. I thought is was going to be a little bulky, but it is not. The only down fall is that the diffuser is a little too large."
3,good album for Michael Schrieve/Santana fans,I like this album basically for the 'View From A Window' track. It is a tranquil progressive piece that is reminiscent of Tangerine Dream 'Cloudburst Flight' from Force Majeure. The acoustic guitar and synthesizer weave a very relaxing vibe. The title track 'Transfer Station Blue' has a disco feel to it like some late-70s Santana tunes. 'Nucleotide' is a drum-based track that would likely please any Michael Schrieve fan.
5,Nothing else like it!,"I got the tape of Transfer Station Blue about 10 years ago and I have listened to it dozens of times, but I still find new sonics in it. It is one of my all time favorite pieces of music. Trouble is, you can't listen to it as background music, you have to just close your eyes and let this marvellous sound roll over you. Does anyone know if he has written anything else like this?"
4,A very good pen and a reasonable price.,"This pen is very nice. It is not the same as a Mont Blanc, but it is stylish and comfortable, and significantly less expensive. I bought one as a gift, and the recipient loves it."
2,weak roach,"Steve Roach is a pretty good ambient producer. I find that Quiet Music II was his best early work.Anyways, this album is forgettable. One reviewrer commented it sounded like it was composed on a Commodore 64. In fact, I wish it was, perhpas then it would have aged better. This is very programmed, boring ambient music.Pick up the Quiet Muisc series, or perhaps investigate his newer stuff which I dont favour. But steer clear of this one. Its pretty dull ands lifeless.Ive got a dozen or so Roach albums. Im writing this as a warning to fans or those newly interested."
5,Essential electronic. A classic.,"This early effort marked the promise of a truly incredible career. Roach's stature in the electronic music movement is undisputed. This ranks certainly as one of his top 2 or 3 works. Each track truly is a aural structure which begins simply enough and slowly, quietly begins to build upon its original melodic foundation until an apex of sheer beauty is reached. It is incredible that a recording of such sublime nature can reach such majestic, intense heights. Riveting yet relaxing at the same time. An unbeleivable juxtaposition of emotion is evoked by this album. This is a feat rarely achieved by any artist. This album helps define and set the standard for what ambient music can achieve. Buy it and let it take its rightful, historical place in your collection."
4,relaxing music,I had the old cassette and wanted a CD. It has been around for a long time and it is one of my favorites as it seems to put me in a trance.Good music to help the mind quiet the chatter.
3,Not White,"I'm sure the technical aspects of this computer are on par with any Sony laptop. I'm just unhappy that it's labeled a ""white"" laptop. Or, I'm unhappy with my decision to purchase this laptop from a retailer that didn't have very good images of the product the way Amazon does.We are setting up an all-white showroom, and needed a laptop (non-Macintosh) in a color to compliment the design. We ordered this Sony ""White"" laptop and...It's not white at all. Funny, the ""Pink"" one is pink. The ""Grey"" one is grey. But the ""White"" one is silver.??"
2,Poor Delivery Service,I paid for this DVD to be shipped within two days. It did not arrive on the day it was supposed to. UPS delivered it to the wrong address. Very disappointed in the way in which it was handled both by UPS and Amazon.
4,Historically incorrect,This movie is a very good movie but historically incorrect. The movie exagerates everything and tells lies. However I really love the music.
1,pretty boring,"I had to watch this movie for a History Project. My teacher made it sound inspiring and dramatic. Maybe it was, but it's hard to know when it makes you fall asleep after 10 minutes. Look elsewhere buddy."
5,Watch This Movie!,This movie is a great way to learn about Apartheid in South Africa and really relate to it!
3,Video Quality just OK,The DVD version of theis movie when played on a widescreen TV has huge top and bottom black bars. Even though it states widescreen the version of widescreen (2:35:1) creates a bigger than normal top and bottom black bar. Other than that I agree with another reviewer that the audio does drop in volume at certain points. But the DVD at least gives us a chance to see a great movie from the 80's other than in VHS. Also I agree the movie version is much more anti govt. than the book. Liberal Hollywood at it's best.
2,DVD has terrible sound,Great movie but try the VHS version. Three different DVDs had insufficient sound. Very low and it's a problem since there's so much great dialogue.
1,Cry Freedom commits an apartheid of its own,"I always found it ironic that ""Cry Freedom,"" while it's supposed to be about the inhumanity, ignorance and hate behind apartheid, it commits its own apartheid by making Steven Biko play second fiddle in what should be his story/film. Instead, as Hollywood filmmakers often do, it makes the minority character a bystander in what should be his/her own story, and pushes a white character into the lead. Like ""Mississippi Burning,"" which basically shows us how two white characters singlehandedly kept the Civil Rights movement alive, ""Cry Freedom"" shows us how a white journalist battles apartheid. By far, Denzel Washington's portrayal of Biko is outstanding, the best performance here. He receives a four star, but the director and the film receive less than a one star for committing its own apartheid, pushing a minority to the back of the bus -- and unfortunately, Hollywood continues to do this -- just go see the implausibility that is ""Last Samurai."""
4,The best film I have seen in a LONG time.,"When I first saw Cry Freedom it was as an assignment forced to us by by History teacher. I thought of it as a way to escape writing essays. But when I began watching, I became completely immersed in the movie. Denzel Washington portrayed Steve Biko with such accuracy, it gave me chills. I loved it and I would recommend it to anyone that wants to have a better opinion of apartheid and about Steve Biko's life and about Donald Woods. It was the greatest biographical movie I have EVER seen. It not only was interesting but it was a great source of learning. Even though I am 14, I enjoyed this movie very much."
4,"Like Attenborough's ""Gandhi"" a very good political film that could have a great one,","In some ways it's a weaker film than ""Gandhi"" - a lot of the tensionfeels manufactured, even though the story is true.But on the other hand, the sheer emotional power of the strongestscenes, like the massacre in Soweto, surpass anything in ""Gandhi"".While many understandably had trouble with making this the story of awhite man -- liberal editor Donald Woods and his family's escape fromSouth Africa after he was banned -- instead of focusing the film onWoods black friend and activist Stephen Biko, I still felt the film worked,and was an effective plea to the world to do something about South Africa.Both Denzel Washington and Kevin Klein are very, very good, although I'vefound both even stronger in other films."
5,Cry Freedom,I enjoy the story of Stephen Biko very much. I loved the movie about how his story got out.
4,A must see for those who don't know,"Although the life of Steven Biko is the reason to watch this movie, we also get a fairly vivid (and admittedly cinematic) view of apartheid. Kevin Kline and Denzel Washington are superb in their roles as white journalist and black martyr, but the film as a whole doesn't sustain its strength from beginning to end--the latter half wanes a bit, but the first half of the film is enticing, frightening, fascinating, educational...you name it. This is an important film, especially for those who know little about apartheid because it will make you want to know more."
5,Washable is great,"Grandchildren all sat on the floor and used these crayons, quite entertaining. Where they missed the paper easily cleaned up."
1,Crayons broke in day 1,Purchased crayons for my 5y/o that loves coloring on her easel. However several broke when she started to use them! She had the triangular washable ones before. These were lame & too skinny & delicate. Get the jumbo size ones because these are a waste!
4,yes they are washable; thankfully!,"I bought these for my daughter. She broke a few immediately and was a bit unhappy with that, so I would describe them as washable but not durable. You may have to scrub alittle but I found that clorox wipes get them off chairs,Tv screens and walls."
3,Really washable but break easily,"These are good washable crayons. You can wipe off drawings on walls, clothing, furniture, anywhere. Comes off easily. However, the con is they are so fragile. Breaks often even with help of tapes around them. But the up side is that you no longer need to worry about marks the toddlers make around the house and on themselves."
2,NOT for toddler!!!,"My toddler broke those crayons in two days. I don't know if they work ok for older kids, but never buy this for your toddler. He actually managed to broke even jumbo size of the same crayons... Thus I didn't like the quality. As he sometimes tries to eat those as well I am sorry I didn't pay more once and didn't buy bee wax crayons instead..."
4,Some good Stories,"I read Graham Greene's collection of short stories after reading ""The Power and the Glory"" and ""The End of the Affair"" and before I read ""The Quiet American"". I think they were largely quite good with some very solid stories. They range from the appalling in ""The Destuctors"" to the very amusing such as ""The Blue Film"". However, I still prefer the author as a novelist; ""The Heart of the Matter"" and ""The Power and the Glory"" in particular."
5,Shakatak The ultimate collection,If you like smooth funky beautiful Jazz this is it. An excellent collection of an excellent group. I reccommend it highly
4,Good Book,Nice story and easy reading to keep your interest. Hard to lose interest in her stories....Hard to put down too.
2,Not very good,"Susan Wiggs is a wonderful storyteller; however, this one is not very good. The main characters are flat and I wasn't able to care about them enough to even finish the book."
5,Great stuff!!!,"I dearly love this fragrance. But, since I cannot get my wife to wear it, I spray a little of it on my pillow at night. Does this make me strange? Hope not, but do hope the manufacturer will make a man's cologne of the same fragrance."
5,My favorite scent,"I have been wearing Oscar de la Renta for years and was able to purchase it from a local wholesale club for a reasonable price. However, they discontinued it and I was faced with going without or paying full price. I was so pleased that I was able to purchase it through Amazon at the same low price."
4,oscar de la renta,Item was just as it was stated in the for sale add.It was shipped & arrived on time.
1,the worst company ever,I placed an $88.00 order with this company for Oscar by Oscar De La Renta...I reseve my order in the mail and much to my dis-may it was something by Oscar in a blue bottle that smelled like oranges and said limited addtion on the bottle. I bought this for my grandmother because this is all that she has wore for 30years...so I wrote the company they said I had to pay the cost to send it back!!! To spend that kinda money and be treated this way its just not worth my time so I have let my friends and family know what has happen I have forwarded them the emails from this company and I can safely say that they nor myself will ever order from this company ever ever again! They do not want to take the chance on being scammed so that is why im writting this so this way nobody else can be scammed either.
2,Picture is not size you get,The picture that is shown is not the size that you actually receive. The bottle I got was half that size.
2,not pleased,"This is the first time I have bought this perfume from here, and am not satified with the staying power. Just not up to snuff."
2,not the real one,this is my third write up if it disappears again will not do it again. The price is what drew me in and it looked identical so ordered it. It came looked the same. Upon opening it and using it it lasted just a few minutes and did not stay with me like the one I was still using here.I feel it is not the same. The price is less than half of anywhere else I should have known just by that. I have used Amazon and I trusted when you sent me to Tuccini to buy it. Wont do that again.
4,Oscar De La Renta for Women,The product arrived as scheduled and was the same as my wife buys at the Department store for double the price I paid.
4,perfumes,I was thoroughly happy with my order. Oscar De La Renta has a wonderful smell and last a long time. I receive a lot of compliments when I wear this spray.
1,refound,"Gentlemen, I wonder when they will make the refund of the purchase on my credit card issued in May, because they never received the product.Thank you"
1,"incomplete, confusing",This book is incomplete. It only includes proper names. Where are the rest of the words in Shakespeare's plays? Not helpful at all. The respelling system is not clear.
3,Les is not at his best,"Les Paul live in NY is a wonderful tribute TO Les Paul. Many famous guitar heroes join him on stage, but this is a Les Paul nearing the end of his song, so his playing is minimal...in some case just a note or chord or two.. Which some might find sad. (even his jokes you have heaard before.)If you love Les and just want anything that captures this amazing mans presence (as I do) you will enjoy Les at his passionate best.. If you are looking for a Les Paul that is going to burn thru riffs and lay out some melodic gems (as in the past)- this is not the dvd/cd for you. There are some wonderful performances from his guests...."
4,nice,it was real nice work from the man that started a revalotion in the music world a true master r.i.p.
1,Devouring Frida: The Art History and Popular Celebrity of Frida Kahlo,"I do not recommend this book at all. It's very tedious and in fact irritating. Instead of writing about Frida's life the author keeps criticizing other authors, such as Hayden Herrera, who wrote biographies on Frida. Margaret Lindauer argues that other authors did not picture Frida in a truly and fair way. She does raise some interesting points such as an opposite view on the general understanding that Frida's was obsessed about having children. The point is that her writing is not enjoyable. I felt as I was reading a text book. I forced myself to read about half of the book so that I can be more sure about my thoughts and I can't continue because I realized I'm wasting my time. After reading 50 per cent of the book I have a vague idea about who Frida could have been. If you are looking for a book that describes Frida as she was this one is definitely not a good idea."
5,"Great relaxing music for rest, meditation or rejuvination.",I still have the tape that was given to me as a birthday present back in the 80's. It still does the same for me as it did then. I can't recommend it enough.Great for slowing and settling the mood. Great for meditation. Great to help you go to sleep and awake refreshed.If you buy this you won't be disappointed.
4,european jazz,When jazz comes from different places [geographically] that brings out the true nature of jazz improvisation/change. The eastern Europeans always have some classical flavor in the mix or you can tell thats there background its cool because its different.
2,Good for about six months,"This remote is nice when it's new but breaks easily. I am on my third remote. The screen broke on the first one and, although it still worked, I could not see any of the information. The second one transmits but does not receive. I take pretty good care of the remotes so they should not break so easily. They should make a more rugged version. Luckily my business pays for the replacements or I might be a little more upset."
1,Remote System,"All I have to say is it sucks! I have bought two of the 479V remotes and they have both crapped out on me. Not to mention, I tried calling Viper Alarm systems and their customer service sucks because they won't even return your calls. They don't insure their remotes either. The new remotes are around $100.00 and it's a waiste of money... DON'T BUY THEIR CAR ALARM SYSTEMS!... it will just keep breaking on you."
5,Simply Amazing!,I bought this about two years ago and it's been a charm to have. No problems whatsoever and I paid an incredibly competitively low price for it off of here.
5,GOOD PRICE!! GREAT SELLER,"HAD PREVIOUS ONE FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS THEN STOPPED WORKING. PAYED ALOT MORE FOR IT TOO. GOOD SELLER ,FAST SHIPPING ,GOOD PRICE ,(LOT OF ALARM PLACES CHARGE ALOT MORE)"
3,Ok Product,I purchased this as a replacement after my old one finally died. It lasted about 6yrs. These remotes are not the best quality but it did last a long time. The display is fragile and ended up getting cracked. I still kept using it with the broken display. The included instructions worked and the new remote operates the alarm and remote start. Have fun.
5,Remote,I have to like it since it is the only control I have for my alarm system. The system has been great other than the remotes wearing out.
5,Good replacement,My old one died and had to replace it. Very easy to setup. Gotta love the new polished remote feel when you've been using a beat up old one for 3 years :).
5,Arguably the Best,"This little book is truly a Spirit inspired classic, and arguably the best exposition aimed at helping us understanding God's will in this very complicated world. It is hopelessly steeped in World War II illustrations, but easily updated and applied to today's world and today's situations."
5,The Will of God by Leslie D. Weatherhead,"These books came SO QUICKLY and the material in it has been a HUGE help for many (including myself) as we struggle to understand God's control in and over life! HALLELUJAH for such a HUGE God that we cannot fully understand, but am so thankful for this book that helps us grasp Him just a little more."
4,Excellent Sermon Material,"I highly recommend this book for anyone who is in ministry. Wonderful food for thought about the will of God. This book totally debunks all the old myths about tragedies in our lives being""the will of God"". Gives true insight to what the ""will of God"" truly means."
5,The Will of God by Leslie D Weatherhead,"This book gives the most lucid explanation I have ever read of God's will vs saying some big horrible thing that happened was God's will. At only about 100 pages in large print, it is an easy read.p.s. The book came out of a series of sermons that Weatherhead preached in England during the air raids of World War II."
5,A Classic,"The Will of God has been around since 1944 with good reason. In only five chapters, Dr. Leslie Weatherhead addresses in a meaningful way the concerns many people have regarding why bad things happen if God is in control. The book is interesting and the logic is well developed."
4,Interesting and worthwhile,Interesting approach to challenging questions and a perspective worth considering in a search for answers. Timeless and thought provoking ideas.
1,Unreadable.,"This book is nonsense and really makes faith seem not like faith. Just a 100 page treatise, basically, on sucking it up."
5,One of the Best,"This Will of God changed my life some years ago. I have held several Bible studies on the book. It gives an extremely good study of what we need to know about God's Will in our lives. All of us have wondered about things around us and what does and does not happen to us. Is it the WILL OF GOD? This book fully describes the true and loving God and His relationship to our circumstances in life. The three Wills described in the book (Intentional, Circumstantial, and Ultimate) give a thorough description of what God wanted for us and how circumstances in life (sickness, death, etc) affect us and our attitude toward the Will of God. HOWEVER, the Ultimate Will of God WILL always prevail."
1,Leslie Weatherhead,"After reading the biography of Leslie Weatherhead, I learned he was a false prophet. His actual beliefs are appalling.I don't recommend this book or anything else he wrote."
5,"If you only read one book in your life, this is the one to read",This book has revolutionized my comprehension of the will of God. I have already bought eight copies to give away and I know I will be ordering more.
4,Polk Audio Monitor 50,The monitor 50's have been perfect for what I bought them for: To use with a sub. I would not recommend these speakers as stand alone but they sound GREAT if used with a sub in any a/v configuration (I am using a Polk Audio PSW110 sub with this and I love the sub) or as the right/left front speakers in a surround format.
5,Floorstand Speakers from Polk Audio Rock!,I got this speaker for my son & he loves it. He has been rocking the house with it. THe only confusion was that there was only one speaker so we purchased another. The hight of the unit was difficult to see from the product info.
4,"Decent sound, perhaps my setup is too weak...","These are well built, and look good. Overall, there is little bass, but I purchased a separate subwoofer anyways. What I want from these speakers are very clear and loud Highs and Mids. They are very clear. But I'm not sure if they are getting maximum power (older Pioneer amp), as I would have prefered these speakers to be louder."
4,Intellectually challenging,"Indeed a highly imaginitive book, full of mindstretching ideas. Not to be missed for those who love ground breaking SF. However it seems to miss something in the story department: it is not as readable as some other works that may be compared to it in scope of ideas."
3,"Fascinating idea, disappointing execution","Why don't we hear other civilizations when we point our radio telescopes at the stars? Because when a species reaches the toolmaking stage, extinction is not far behind. The rate of social evolution is quickly overwhelmed by the speed of technological innovation.Unfortunately, the story in which this hypothesis unfolds is not up to the quality of the idea that frames it. I'd love to see this idea explored by Theodore Sturgeon or Asimov or even Heinlein."
2,clever but cheap quality,"When I saw this product in the store, I thought it was a very clever idea. But when looking at the pots, the very low quality was quite obvious. The handles are not well attached and very cheaply made. With handles that rotate on the pot and look like they'll fall off after regular use, images of spilling boiling water on myself kept me from even considering purchasing this product."
2,Cookware,"I am glad that the price was what I paid because I may just have gotten less value than given.One of my pots came with a loose broken handle, one of the no-boil tops was bend out of shape but because of the thinnenst of the material easily shaped back.The glasstops that double as covers or dishes are quite heavy and I burned my fingers trying to take it off, I guess the idea was to turn them over and place the food into it.Overall, I am not happy at all with the quality or the sizes that they came in.I should have gone to JC Penney and bought the one that they had on sale.Never too old to keep on learning."
1,why waste time to read garbage?,"Apparently, the authors don't know anything about genetic:even basic theory of Genetic scinece, I wonder how they can write such a book on socilal management??? sure, this book is garbage, no doubt...full of unrealities..... Maybe because genetic engineer is so popular in present, many people want to touch it, but at least those people should have some basic knowledge.....too bad, such a bad book....., do not waste time on it...."
5,A great review book!,"I loved this book and recommend it highly. My only caveat is to have some time set aside to read through it. I was up for hours and hours, reading his reviews of movies that I have already seen, remembering the highlights of great movies. I couldn't put it down. If you love movies, and if you love your DVD machine, this book is a match made in heaven. Buy it. Buy it now."
3,Not Based On A True Story Nor Events But Good Story,the movie wasn't based on a true story!!!Fact One:Butch is still alive but in the movie Butch was doing some of the killings as a ghostFact Two:it was actor's playing the parts<...>Fact Three:that wasn't even the right house to many things were wrong such as the backyard not having a pool when the real one did the windows where changed to regular ones way before this year was suppose to take place of the murders in movie the house still had those window eyes.Fact Four:there's no record of this murder ever happening.
1,Hauntingly horrible!,"Not much to say about this but this is definitely one of the worst movies I've seen, not to mention some really bad acting. Save your money on this one because this is nothing in comparison to Paranormal Activity and gives the Amityville horror franchise a bad name. This was 80+ mins of my life I won't get back..lol"
3,Just Okay,"Well I guess its up for debate whether or not The Asylum makes good movies but in my opinion most of their found footage flicks have been pretty entertaining in the past. I enjoyed Paranormal Entity and Gacy House. Monster was OKAY, The Exorcist Tapes sucked. With that being said, The Amityville Haunting fell kind of flat. The acting was worse then usual (for Asylum) and I didn't get the same kind of creeps I got out of some of the above mentioned movies. I think if you're a fan of found footage movies then check it out, but don't expect too much from it."
3,THE AMMITYVILLE DVD COLLECTION,AS FAR AS THE COLLECTION IN GENERAL YES IT IS IN NOT THAT GOOD OF SHAPE 2 OF THE DVDS IN THE COLLECTIONS R COPIED DVD NOT ORIGINAL WHICH I WAS DISSAPOINTED IN!! WHICH THE COMPANY DID NOT STATE THAT WHEN THEY WERE SELLING THEM!! I HAVE SEEN OTHER COLLECTIONS IN BETTER SHAPE!! NO VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS COMPANY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE!! KC
3,Okay... not great...,"Yet another entry in the ""found footage"" sub-genre of horror, ""Amityville Haunting"" was not too bad. Purists will notice right off the bat that the house is definitely not the same on in the original movie and its sequels. They will also notice that the ghost ""accompanying"" the obligatory little girl was not the same one in the original films. Although I was a bit disappointed by those blaring discrepancies, I decided to overlook them. There were a few thrills overall, but for the most part ""Amityville Haunting"" came out looking more like ""Paranormal Activity."" I was really put off by the parents, a former/retired Marine and his hapless wife. The writers made them out to be too stubborn, so stubborn that they would so blatantly ignore their son's pleas to just ""look at the tape."" Well, if they had, I guess the movie would have been over much sooner! Overall, a decent horror film, but nothing really original."
2,Movie good/ DVD stuck in my DVD palyer,"The movie itself I liked. First and only time watching it, the DVD got stuck in my DVD player. My daughter had to take my DVD player apart to get it out. DVD player ruined. I wont watch it again for fear of breaking another DVD player."
1,Has nothing to do with the original house!,I am very dissapointed not at the seller but at whomever made this movie. It really sucked. The footage says real footage but it wasn't! It was all actors! And the house was completely different from the true Amityville house. SUCKS!
2,Mediocre Found-Footage Film,"Amityville Haunting is another basic found-footage horror film. A new family moves into the house and begin experiencing supernatural events; the events are capture by Luke, the son, and home security cameras. The acting ranges from terrible to mediocre; the scenes where Luke talks to himself are very bad and sound incredibly forced. There are only a few good scares, while most scares fell flat for me. The ending was simply okay. It claims to be real footage, but it obviously isn't. It really doesn't impress or try anything new at all, you've seen this movie before.By the way, there is some nudity and sex at the beginning of the film and only a little blood. Save your money, I caught it on Netflix Streaming (available as of 6/21/12) and definitely wouldn't recommend paying for it.*Originally posted on VoD version."
4,A chapter book for young girls,"I had missed this in my own childhood, but got it for my two five year old granddaughters and started reading it to them. Both were very interested. Their moms were going to finish it in the New Year and most likely did. I'll ask whether either girl wants the sequel(s)."
4,Charming!!!,"Somebody said: It is never too late to have a happy childhood. Well, reading Betsy-Tacy will give anyone a good idea about what a nice childhood is about. This is the first book in a series of books about Betsy. The reader follows her from age five, as she is in this book. It is absolutely delightful! Betsy's life changes much to the better as a new girl her age, Tacy, becomes her neighbour and her best friend. Together, they play and explore the world around them. Reading this book is so enjoyable ... it leaves the reader with a nice feeling of satisfaction."
4,Delightful for advanced readers 6-7 years old,"My daughter, aged 7, reads at a 4th-5th grade level. It is hard to find chapter books that relate to her interests and friends. The Besty-Tacy series is wonderful to find. It tells the story of younger children (my daughter says like ""when she was little"") and has loads of imagination and fantasy play. The writing style is more for 9-10 year olds. What a treat!"
1,cheap and ineffective,The fan is made of cheap plastic and will probably break soon. The fan barely puts out any air. Next time I will spend a little more money for hopefully a better product that actually blows air.
1,Junk,"Having been in the dog world for many years, when I saw the name Precision - I assumed this would be a good product. They are nothing but junk. They were falling apart in hours after hanging on the crates. One fell off (the arm broke off) at the show, fell on the ground and the plastic broke. During the day, the rest of the arms fell off and I had to junk them. Even a give-away toy from McDonalds would have better quality."
1,Would NOT recommend you to puchase,"I bought 2 of these fans for using on the dogs that we keep in the back of the car - we have a black car and I worry my 2 dogs will overheat when we travel with them often.I ordered 2 of these fans, one was broken, for the cost to ship it back, it wasn't worth it. The other one hardly puts out any air and is loud - and you need to use several ""C"" batteries that only last about 4 hours - that is barely a one way trip for us!Save your money if you want to get a create cooling fan!"
3,Works ok,It does not throw off as air as I would like to keep the dogs cool. Will probably look for something else.
1,Great Purchase,"This movie was in great condition, shipping was fast. I would definitely work with this seller again. I highly recommend them to all."
1,great movie let down by lousy soundtrack...& no dvd features,"There is no doubt that Brewsters Millions is a wonderful comedy. Richard Pryor really does steal the show with his performance. Unfortunately, and it may be that I got a faulty dvd, but the sound track was so poor I had to turn it off. As I said in the title, it is a great movie and I really do love it, but this dvd was a lousy buy! Oh, and for those of you that think it might be my player or the region code, none of the above as I not only have a world zone player but one that can be programmed to a specific zone such as 1, USA, 4 Asia/Pacific. And I have purchased other dvd's from Amazon with no sound/vision problems. So, I have to say it is the disc..."
4,How would you Spend 30 Million Dollars?,"Often times people ask the question; What would you do if you had a million dollars? Well if you need some suggestions check out this movie. The overall plot is that Pryor has 30 days to spend 30 Million dollars if he wants to gain an even bigger fortune. The movie provides quite a few gags. The gags don't all work, but the concept is so interesting that it really doesn't matter. This movie not only gives us a few laughs but gives us a peek at just how rich some people (like Bill Gates for instance) must be."
5,"""Monty ptiches, and I catch - the money won't change us!""","A riotus & endearing look at freindship, greed, snobbery and all that's in between. Candy & Pryor at their best!"
4,"""We're in business to do business, so let's do business!""","In the realm of absurd 80's comedies, this remake rises above the average thanks to a sharp script and the combined genius of Richard Pryor and John Candy. I wish we could have seen more pictures with that pair. It's not perfect, and some of the other parts should have been cast differently (Lonette McKee as Angela Drake), but this is one of those stories you don't mind watching over and over again. Remember that hand thing John Candy does when he announces his recent investment success? ""Ten million, ten million, ten million dollars!"" That's one of my enduring image of Candy."
5,Great movie and great lesson,BE sure to watch this if you hit the lottery. Better to let Richard Prior make the mistakes and not you. Funny entertaining. A lot of fun to watch.
4,A solid Pryor romp that brings many laughs!,I liked this movie as a kid and I still enjoy it once and a while now. Richard Pryor has always been a great comedian and many of his movies are some of the best comedies around. Brewster's Millions has an interesting twist that appeals to most peoples fantasies and to watch Brewster try and achieve his golas just gets very interesting. John Candy is very funny in his supporting role and it is great to see Brewster lose it when his attempts to blow the maoney on stupid investments actually pay dividends. The film is not outrageous and is pretty standard but certain elements like the decorating of his office really are hysterical moments. Definately worth at least a rental.
3,Classic Premise for Comedy,"PLOTAn amateur league baseball pitcher will inherit 300 million dollars from a distant relative on the proviso that he first spend 30 million dollars in 30 days. Various other conditions are also made painfully clear.REVIEWA well-constructed cast including Richard Pryor and John Candy, and decent character actors of yesteryear such as Lonette McKee, Stephen Collins, Jerry Orbach, Pat Hingle and Hume Cronyn, make the most of a great idea that is otherwise ill-served by a mediocre script and perfectly standard direction from the usually quite brilliant Walter Hill. Candy's chemistry with Pryor is first rate - why Pryor instead chose Gene Wilder as his long-term comedic partner will forever remain a baffling mystery.While Brewster's Millions is not the funniest film of the 80s, certainly there are moments of hilarity here. Watch for a side-splitting cameo from Rick Moranis."
4,No need to think of what I need,"Because of the range of screw drivers, I really do not have to think twice if I have the right one.And the fact it is cushion gripped and magnetic tipped makes it even better."
3,OK,"Nice set for around the house, but any real pressure on the Philliphs will destroy them. Not for construction jobs, but otherwise good value."
5,DEEP PURPLE ON THE WINGS OF A FOXBAT,WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD I HEARD A BOOTLEG WITH DEEP PURPLE CALLED ON THE WINGS OF A RUSSIAN FOXBAT AND WHEN THE FIRST SONG CAME OUT FROM THE SPEAKERS I JUST KNEW THIS IS GONNA CHANGE MY LIFE ... THE SONG WAS BURN ..NOW I GOT THIS DOUBLE CD AND NOW I CAN HEAR THE FULL CONCERT AND WHAT CAN I SAY DEEP PURPLE FINEST WITH TOMMY BOLIN...THE MUSIC IS SO FUNKY AND HEAVY AND TOMMY IS PLAYING LIKE NEVER BEFORE ..DONT BUY THIS TIME AROUND LIVE IN TOKYO(2cd)BUY THIS IT SO BETTER AND THE SOUND QUALLITY IS SO GOOD ::CHEERS DANIEL GARDSKÄR DEEP PURPLE FAN SINCE 1996
5,Great for Endurance,"This product was recommended by my holistic practitioner. She said go to the Bach remedies in Whole Foods and choose an essence based on what calls to you the most. Somewhat skeptical, I headed to Whole Foods and found the Bach display. Immediately, I found Olive which is supposed to help when you are mentally and physically exhausted. That described me perfectly. Since I am on an extremely tight budget, I noticed it was on sale. The price called to me so I headed to the register.Ultimately, I don't know if the formula will work for everyone. I do know that it works for me. It isn't a major energy boost but a feeling of inner strength and calmness. Just a few drops in your water and you are set all day.Highly recommended for those who are experiencing health or emotional stressful situations. But you may want to do your own research to determine if there is another remedy that would work better for you."
5,Every song is a classic master piece,"I am really in love with French Canadian singers, from very popular Celine Dion, to more sophisticate Lara Fabian, and Isabelle Boulay really push the popular music to a whole higher class!This concert was performed with Montreal Symphony Orchestra, and Isabelle Boulay was in deed part of the symphony. The whole CD is so good, I can't even tell which song is my favorite. (most CDs have one or two, if more than that, you got a master piece...)If you have any appreciation of classical music, you will likely LOVE this one!"
5,So good!,"One of my 2 all-time favorite albums. Beautiful songs, beautiful voice with heart.If you're learning French, there's an insert with the lyrics."
5,Des arrangements extraordinaires,"Les chansons sont toutes agréables à écouter et les arrangements, avec l'orchestre symphonique, donne une tout autre dimension aux chansons. Un très bon album. La pochette est aussi bien conue..."
4,Rebuttal For Ripoff Of African Queen,"After viewing this film I was left with mixed emotions, yet I feel it safe to state the Peter O Toole was great in the aforementioned film. Also I feel it is unfair, to slam this film... It did drag a bit in parts, but what film action or otherwise doesnt suffer from this malady. Best regards."
1,Long Dragged out and boring,"This was a very poor story and it dragged out so long and was not very realistic. You have no idea where the story takes place and it was so unbelievable. Peter O'Toole is not much of an actor here, just goes about screaming like an idiot. I do not recommend this unless you are a O'Toole die hard."
4,Thumbs Up,"A good movie with some slow pacing to make it drag here and there, but an original tale with the charmismatic Peter O'Toole doing brillant work, with wonderful stunt flying by Frank Tallman. An adventure movie with a literary feel to it, which is what you don't get much of these days. END"
4,Adventure in revenge.....,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, not only because of the intense portrayal by Peter O'Toole as Murphy, but also because of the interesting story line. If one has to make an example of single minded pursuit of an objective, this movie is one of the best. It is an uncluttered adventure in revenge for a British seaman, one of two survivors of a ship sent to the bottom by a German U-boat, who's crew was cold-bloodedly massacred while in the water. Good aerial photography, coupled with a good supporting cast and one period song. Near the end of the movie, the philosophical and moral questions thrown by an exasperated Louis (played by Phillipe Noiret) to an unlistening Murphy says more about why it was entitled ""Murphy's War."""
5,Another lost filmic gem saved by DVD.,"Being an avid film buff I can't understand why I had never seen, or heard of, this self contained veritable masterpiece of anti-war movie making. I picked this up at my local Australian Kmart (yuck) with a bunch of other forgotten films of ""antiquity"" and it was the best twelve bucks I ever spent."
5,Great Book,"I bought this book prior to starting law school. I thought the book gave sound advice, and I planned to use the system described in the book. When I arrived at orientation, the faculty outlined the methods they had observed highly sucessful students using over the years. The advice nearly matched the system in the book word for word. Of course, everyone in my class got this information, but the program my school has instituted is quite rare among law schools. I would highly recommend this book for anyone looking for an edge in law school."
3,Somewhat outdated and not fun to read,"I bought this book, and while I'm not exactly sorry that I did, I don't think it's the best of the plethora of similar books out there. Deaver spends a great deal of time outlining his system, which he used WITHOUT A COMPUTER. While the system is easily adapted to a computer format, it makes many of his points about what kind of paper to write on and such useless.I also found his description of a study system less easy to follow and less promising than that described in _Law School Confidential_, which I recommend highly.Overall, I'd say if you're a really anal-type looking to have a system laid out to follow to the letter, this book might work for you. For me, I just wanted something a little more flexible and with more information about why the author likes a certain method of studying."
3,Oversimplified!,"I feel that this book oversimplifies law school. I just felt like it made the work seem very easy...and I did feel that it was outdated in terms of what students rely on nowadays to study for their courses. And the book put too much emphasis on the outline, and not enough on other ways to grasp the material, such as study groups and supplements. I referred to it a few times since I've been in law school, but only a few times have I found much of what it says worthwhile. However, I did appreciate the definitions of what a ""hornbook"" was as opposed to a ""casebook,"" and it does serve to ease the nerves. However, law school is a little different than this! I think it's time for a new edition!"
3,the gems obscured by the confusion,"One of the worst things a 1L can do is rely on confusing, ambiguous advice. The law is ambiguous, but the way to succeed in law school really isn't. This book is simply not direct enough to be helpful, and it contains too much unhelpful advice. If you learn nothing else from any of these books, learn this: You must outline (preferably on a computer, where you can move fast, have high endurance, be neat, and move stuff around, if nec.). Start early and keep up regularly. How you outline is more flexible than is sometimes suggested. Just do it."
3,Not Bad,Overall-not a horrible book by any stretch of the imagination. I'd suggest buying a used copy for cheap. I still am looking for a another book to prepare me for law school.
5,Excellent!,Excellent introductory book in pediatric radiology! It avoids useless babble about rare conditions and diseases and it gives concise information and useful tips for interpreting radiological examinations in children. Very well written text that is easy to read and ideal for quick reference. If you are a radiology resident doing your rotation in a pediatric department this book can prove your best friend.
3,"ok, not enough pics","info good, but was hoping for better atlas, actual xrays, normal xrays of things such as normal growth plates, and more pics."
5,Agreement with Sproal,"This is indeed a fine work. A rather detailed work as well (without getting to gripped by techinicality). If you haven't read it..beware it is not the easiest read, but it isn't a difficult one either. Prepare to spend a little time with it to grasp its full message. If you don't have this one...you need it. Grace and peace."
2,an entire book explaining what the human will is,I had heard the author was a Christian writer. I didn't need to read an entire book explaining what my will is. Maybe if he went into how our will fits into God's plan it would have held some interest for me
4,Surprised,I was a little surprised at exactly how damaged it was. I feel like the description toned it down.
5,A little-known gem,"I bought this along with the M-W dictionary and thesaurus. I had never heard of it, but it fills a special niche that anyone who enjoys speaking and writing correctly can appreciate. I highly recommend it."
4,Cute Watch!,"I just received this watch and it is very cute! I read other reviews and was a bit worried it might be too small but I think it is the perfect size. I don't like oversized watches and this is just right. The only thing I do not like about it is that the description stated that the band is leather and it is a man made material. It is still very nice so I will enjoy it, but I have to admit, I did order it partially because it said the band was leather. This is a very fun, nice watch for Disney fans!"
3,"Not great, but not terrible either","As is the opinion of other readers, her second book just wasn't as riveting as the first. Based on those other reviews, I'm looking forward to reading her third book."
4,Very Informative,I bought this book for a family member who has a miniature pinscher. They have read it and told me that it's a very informative book and has helped them with training their dog and other things as well.
5,bratz,great doll to have in a collection very well made and very pretty and nice hair i hate dolls with hardley no hair on them or poor quality and this one was not did not like the purple around the eyes not realistic but then again it really for kids
4,last gig with Blackmore 94,"Blackmore had still played some pretty stuffs on this album,...though he left after that.. check out the songs as Anyone's daughter, Twist in the tale, perfect strangers,...what a timeless songs...they are"
4,Live and Clean,"I hate most live albums because the recorded sound is bad, but this live album sonically amazing, I suspect it has been retouched in studio. Any info?"
5,Tight,"I thought ""My All"" was a pretty tight song and so was ""Breakdown"". At first I only bought her album cuz it featured Krayzie Bone & Wish Bone of the greatest Rap group ever: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. Then I bought the single to ""My All"" cuz it had the ""Breakdown (Mo Thugs Remix)"" and it featured an extra member from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony which was Layzie Bone, then i found myself listening to the rest of her songs and I found out that they're pretty tight. My two favorite were ""My All"" & ""Breakdown (Mo Thugs Remix)"""
4,A great beginninng place for a China beginner,"Graphically inviting, the atlas organizes data relating to many topics in a map-like manner. One can scan information on politics, education, religion and a score of other subjects. And it's in a handy magazine format."
3,This is not a good book for detailed maps,"I probably didn't understand this was a book with general maps showing demographics and economic information, and not a ""road atlas"". It has very good info if you want to understand demographics using good visual charts, etc., but you can't use it for just having detailed maps of the China regions and cities."
3,Good movie; Average quality of DVD,"This is one of those movies that wasn't that bad to watch but also not a great one. The storyline was interesting enough to take the viewer till the end of the movie. After the first few scenes, you start to expect something very good from the movie, but it turns out to be an average ending in totality. Anthony Quinn's acting as always, is above average and he's the reason I actually got this DVD. 3 stars for this one."
4,Great acting!,John Phillip Law stole this movie completely away from Anthony Quinn! Good story line. Well worth your time. A must see for JPL fans!!
3,A good (not great) read on Antarctica if you are going there.,"There may be a growing body of literature on Antarctica, but let's face it: about 80% of it is about Amundsen, Scott, or Shackleton. That's fine, but if you're reading in preparation for a trip to Antarctica, you want more. Campbell's book is a very readable albeit superficial overview of the wildlife and physical landscape you're likely to encounter. I agree with other reviewers that Campbell comes across as stuck-up, and I do take exception to his disparaging of tourists, since my experience has been that Antarctic tourists tend to be very environmentally respectful. I recommend the book because its insights and information did enhance my enjoyment of Antarctica and the South Shetlands."
3,Some good ideas...,"I liked some of the ideas. I like the interesting facts, and found the science explanations are accurate and very complete. I like the choice of experiments, and most of them are fun. (although I'm not sure all of them are especially safe for the younger mad scientist set), but I was disappointed that a decent number of the experiments simply don't work. I understand there's a margin of error, but as an adult (and a science teacher), When I can't make experiments work, I pity the poor children with the book."
2,How to Cause Mayhem and Get in Trouble,"Some of these ""science experiments"" are simple and relatively harmless. Others provide unsupervised children with recipes for disaster. The book should come with a child-proof cover or a trigger-lock. Not that it contains plans for thermonuclear devices, but several of the projects can damage property or cause injury if not properly carried out.While each project has a set of fascinating ""scientific"" tidbits & trivia to go with it, the book is almost entirely lacking in helping children understand or use the scientific method or understand much of the basis for what they are doing. This is a ""Mad Scientists' Club"" handbook, just a several steps short of the Anarchists' Cookbook, but headed in that general direction.On the other hand, parents may find themselves reliving their own nerdy & awkward years helping their children be ""mad scientists."" It could be great fun. But keep the book locked up. A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing!"
2,Not enhanced for widescreen televisions,Hong Kong martial arts movie fans beware. The transfer has not been formatted for widescreen televisions. It's like it's 1998 with this DVD!
2,Not for large TVs!,"Like the other review says this is not enhanced for widescreen televisions! The picture is very small on large TVs taking up only the middle area of the screen and leaving black bars on the left and right side as if it was a standard image not widescreen.However, on smaller TVs the picture does appear widescreen and looks decent enough. Only buy this is you plan on watching it on a small TV. The image is passable on my 24 inch TV but it is basically unwatchable on my 46 inch.The image is soft and the colors are fairly washed out compared to other WellGo USA releases. This is sad because I want this company to do well since they are one of the only companies bringing movies over to the US nowadays.I haven't watched the entire film yet so I can't comment on how good or bad the movie is just the quality of the DVD."
2,"All Guitar, No Vocal, Gee What's New?","OK, so J.D. Simo is one of literally a thousand young players out there who have managed to copy Stevie Ray Vaughan licks note for note. I think there is at least one from every state everyone raves about. Sitting in your room and rewinding sections of CDs all day is, well ok for a little while. Congrats, now you need to get your own sound, lyrics, and set of riffs, oh and ya, please get a real vocalist. I am so sick of teenage, suburban boys trying to sing blues...it just ain't working. This disc was released in 2000 and young Mr. Simo hasn't done much else, that ought to speak volumes. It's one thing to do your homework and another to actually graduate. Another waste of time disc."
4,She's beautiful,I haven't read the manga but figured it had something to do w/ her different arm. I didn't buy my figuring from Amazon but it is worth the price. She's limited addition and a very nice keeper if you're a fan of Hellsing and especially the police-girl.She's already found her home in my collection.
3,Must read for anyone interested in the culture wars,"This is the classic essay that brought into focus the contrast between the ""two cultures,"" i.e. the sciences and the humanities. It simply is a must read for anyone who is seriously interested in the recent and to some extent still ongoing culture wars, in particular the clash between postmodernism and scientism. Snow's original lecture constitutes the central part of this book, but the historical preface is just as valuable to provide the reader with the proper context and follow-up to the controversy. I found Snow's own update, on the other hand, rather superfluous. It was probably written too soon after the original, without leaving sufficient time for interesting developments to unfold. The Kindle edition is well formatted."
1,corporate-controlled public policy,"Not only does this glib, simplistic political tract dis 150 years of literature; it also grotesquely misrepresents science itself. If you are familiar with their writing or biographies, you know that its viewpoint does not accord with the viewpoints of such as Albert Einstein, Robert Oppenheimer, Linus Pauling, Sir Fred Hoyle, Carl Sagan, and Richard Feynman, men who not only underwent ""scientific training"", but who actually contributed something of value to the discipline."
4,"historic document, with intro essay","The Two Cultures is probably more famous as an idea which ignited discussion than as the lecture it is. This edition of C.P. Snow's classic includes a brilliant introduction by Stefan Collini. I'm surprised that none of the other reviewers mention this portion of the edition, a substantial 64 pages, because for me it was the most interesting read. That is, only after having read The Two Cultures and a follow-up essay by Snow and pondered what may still apply today in his argument I went back and read the Collini. His introduction put Snow's work in its proper historical contexts (those of post-war Britain as well as Snow's own life) and updates us with some of the major points of the historical discourse that followed. I recommend that Collini's essay is read after Snow's, and together they make a very fine read."
5,Wedding Cakes You Can Make,"I purchased this book to give me a general feel as to what are your basic steps for creating a wedding cake. This book has done more than given me general information. I am so glad I got the book, for those who are bakers and would like to take the next step, I would highly recommend this book."
4,"It's great, but...","This is a great book for beginers. The recipes are simple, helpful and very yummy. I only have 2 issues with this book. Firstly, the recommened amount for moistening syrup was way to much in my opinion. I understand not wanting your cake to be dry but she overloads. Secondly, If you are baking a square cake be prepared to whip out your calculator in do some math. Most of the measurements are for round cakes, 6-14, but it only gives equivilents to 3 sizes of square cakes. This book would have been better if she would have added a few pages dedicated to square cakes.*I know I can't spell, go easy on me*"
4,very informative book on the nuts and bolts of making wedding cakes,"A lot of what goes into a successful wedding cake isn't exactly exciting or sexy. Things like buying the right cardboard rounds, putting dowels in your tiers so they are strong, laying down foam in your car to help transport and mixing your batter and buttercreams correctly. Dede explains the ins and outs of every step of cake making in a way that is very clear and concise. I have other books that claim to be more definitive (and weigh in at many more pages) but don't go into the detail that she does.My only gripe is that the styling on some of the cakes is a little off. The tower of cupcakes photo shows three tiers that are off-kilter (not intentionally, I'm pretty sure) and there is another cake with sloppy basketweave piping. Lastly, I wish she would have given a chapter to working with fondant. It's too popular of a look to, um, overlook.Maybe in your next book, Dede? :-)"
5,WOW WONDERFUL WEDDING CAKES,THIS IS A GREAT BOOK EASY TO FOLLOW GREAT STEPS YOU WILL END UP WITH A WONDERFUL WEDDING CAKE HOMEMADE AND MADE BY YOU WHAT ELSE CAN YOU ASK FOR.
4,Excellent buy!,"I could hardly wait to get my physical hands on this book. Tried one of the basic cake recipe, OK for beginners, however, I'll stick with the one I have been using. I love the way she gives you timelines for organizing yourself to make the beautiful cakes in her book. The book was well worth the purchase! Would recommend to new cake decorators."
1,Yuck!,I was so excited to get this book. I make wedding cakes already and was looking for some new recipes to offer. I thought I would try them out for my sisters wedding and it was awful. I spent a ton of money on the special ingredients and was throughly disappointed. The recipes were awful. I would not recomend this book for the recipes but there were some neat tips about cake decorating.
5,wedding cake makers,This book is a wedding cake bible for usbeginners. Has everything you could possiblyask for and more. Would recommend to anyonestarting out like me.
4,Great photos and ideas,I am finding out cake decorating is one of my things an what better way to learn than with great pics and instructions.
5,Great Recipes!,"This is actually the first cake decorating book that I have purchased. It was great for recipes! Especially the Fruit with Rum... yummy. So if you're looking for a good book with recipes, this one's a good one!"
3,Good but could be better,"This book has a couple good ideas and pointers of things you may not have thought of. It is definitely for the beginner though.I think not including fondant AT ALL (because of personal preference) wasn't a very great idea, even a page or so dedicated to it would have been fine.The reason I deducted 2 stars though is I HATE when a book isn't proof-read and I'm not finished reading it as yet but there are about 5 references to page 000 and an equipment list I'm yet to find."
4,great instruction book,"This is a fantastic step-by-step instruction book. I had no idea how much planning really went into creating a wedding cake but this book lays everything out for you in a pretty easy-to-follow format. I've only made one cake so far (a sample cake, like she recommends) and the frosting was spectacular but the cake itself didn't really taste like much of anything. I'm thinking that I'll borrow a lot of the techniques mentioned in this book and apply them to a recipe from another cookbook. A must for a novice baker!"
1,Horrible Kindle Edition,"Do not buy the Kindle edition. There were so many missed print and duplicate paragraphs, makes it really hard to follow and understand the tips and tricks that are in the book. Also, it's all in black and white so you can't tell how the cake should look. It was a mistake to think the Kindle edition would be as good as printed text. Never again."
1,ONLY THE MOST RABID FANS NEED APPLY,"The audio on this disc is OK, but the band just sounds horrible. It's well known that Blackmore hated the ""Stormbringer"" album, and had already made up his mind to leave the band. His playing at this point sounds like he just couldn't care less.Glenn Hughes' consistent screeching is especially annoying; when they hired him, the band must have felt they needed someone to imitate Ian Gillian's style, but he just does it constantly, and badly.My recommendation: Buy the ""Made In Japan"" remastered ""deluxe"" disc and the expanded 3-disc ""Live in Japan"" companion set. It's far more enjoyable, plus, it's fun to hear Blackmore screw up the intro to ""Smoke On The Water"" not once, but twice!"
5,absolutely cool,"Ritchie left the band in 1975, but the Final concerts of Mark III line up was still in the top form,..the burn, stormbringer, Gypsy songs are absolutely rarities and previously unreleased versions on stage,..Buy people buy,..a MUST for DP FANS!"
5,One of the funniest movies I have ever seen,I saw this movie with some friends and we spent the entire time writhing on the floor with laughter. A top notch comedy.
3,Fun here and there,"I wasn't very savvy to Mr. Smith before watching this film today, so I came in with an open mind. It's sometimes a fun film, light. It has a pretty good setting and some decent ideas. The mall is well shot. Substance-wise though, this movie isn't going to bowl you over. Mostly I just watched it because it was a flick from the 90s. The men in this movie are slouches. Claire Forlani is quite a sight, a knockout. Lee is very good but a lot of the acting in this movie is pretty stiff, and some promising performances like those of the villains are sadly short lived. It's basically like a slacker drive-in movie."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:One of Kevin Smith's lesser works, Mallrats sometimes suffers from poor acting (though admittedly it's hard to make Smith's hyper-cool dialogue sound spontaneous) and isn't terribly well plotted, but it's a reasonably entertaining film."
2,Blu-ray Import Doesn't Include extras,"Please note that the Amazon listing for the Blu-ray import indicates it contains the same bonus materials as the old DVD, but this is not the case. The imported Blu-ray actually doesn't include any bonus material. Now if Universal would get with it and release a proper American version all this confusion could be avoided."
4,New and semi improved 10th Anniversary Edition,"Although I am a big fan of Mallrats I disliked the new edition for reason that I will exslain, but I did like the new special features that were on this new cut.For the bad part first, I very much disagreed with the new extended edition because it didn't have anything to do with the incident of Julie Dwyers death which had lots to do in the clerks movie as well. But the movie still has the original on it as well so no worries.The good news is the special features have been upgraded to include A Q&A; with Kevin Smith. Which I found quit hilarious.So sit Back and relax and enjoy the beauty of Mallrats!"
3,warning to consumer,"well you all know that this is a damn good movie but be warned all dvd purchasers, the copy that I received with the two in one screen special feature with the audio commentary you may find it effects the audio when viewing normally. About 5 times during the movie the sound starts to jump a bit can become very annoying."
5,STINKPALM,WHY DID I MISS THIS MOVIE? this was hysterical and I had never even heard of it until 2000. I remember seeing an ad a long time ago but it seemed like cheese at the time and the name Mallrats turns off a certain demographic (me) that's why I didn't remember it. But I just let loose one day and decided on the recommendation of a friend to view. All I have to say is stinkpalm- this movie rules. IMPORTANT NOTE: If your older than 35 you may not like this movie. DVD a must because deleted scene of the girls father coming out of the shower will make you cry laughing.
3,"Great DVD, lackluster movie,","Well, when you start following Kevin Smith's movie career and get here, there might be two possibles outcomes.1. You will lose all respect for mr. Smith2. You will forgive him and laugh with his worst slapstick, because , after all, a bad Smith movie is better that any regular teen comedy.This DVD is jam packed, and has very decent anamorphic transfer. The 5.1 sound is neat and the extras are so informational you will get tired at one point.Just for historical purpose, this was the dvd that started the excelent ""Viewaskew DVD trend."" Since this edition, every Wieaskew release follows a very similar strcuture in representig each DVD. So, if you are a Hardcore fan, buy it now....if not...rent first...."
5,The critic was watching another movie 'cause Mallrats RULES!,"If you've seen any Kevin Smith movie you know you're in for a wild ride. The best dialogue in movie history was made by Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino, but unlike Tarantino, Smith uses comedy in a more... oh screw it, if you're reading this just do yourself a favor and BUY THIS DVD! The movie is one of the best comedies of the 90's, the extra's on the DVD are the stuff movie geek's dreams are made of. The best buy I've made this year.Jay & Silent Bob RULE!"
5,Best Kevin Smith movie so far?,This is in my humble opinion the best film Kevin Smith has done yet. Much better than Chasing Amy and Dogma. Clerks is good but Mallrats is just a little better.The new collectors edition dvd gives the viewer plenty of extras so enough already.... buy this movie.
4,"It's less intelligent than Clerks, but still entertaining","Mallrats is chapter 2 in the kevin Smith Saga and for the most part holds it's own. I have yet to see the last three of the films but from what I can tell he is going for a similar pattern yet different courses. FOr one thing the profanity level is through the roof. However the humor is as apealing as in CLerks.However where clerks was intleligent humor, Mallrats is more sightgags. For example the guy who can't see the Sailboat in the picture, or the antics of Jay and Silent Bob. It's deffinetly more sight gags.Over all howver don't judge just because of the change of pace, the movie still holds it's own as a funny title, and a very raunchy, but still very funny."
3,Smith went a little too far to impress.,"After the mega-success of Clerks, Kevin Smith tried a little too hard to impress the masses with Mallrats. Now we have the introduction of some ""stars"" into the mix. That is, if you want to consider Shannen Doherty a star. The plot is weakened by some forced comedy elements. Too many prat falls and silly humor take away from the edge that this movie could have had. Luckily, Kevin Smith got it back together when he made Mallrats."
4,"Mallrats, the bible of my highschool years.","This movie didn't receive the any big hollywood recognitionand, to be honest, it probably didn't deserve much. Like my titlesaid, this was basically my bible in high school. This was the moviethat, however horibble this may sound, defined the life of friends andI. It is a funny show, with some casual wit, and mild ... shots. Jayand Silent Bob shine like the stars? they are. This was, by far JasonLee's best preformance, in a Smith Film. There is a peice ofeveryonein this film, even if that may be hard to admit. END"
3,"Inconsistent, but it's still Kevin Smith!","This movie is not as consistently funny as Smith's other three films. The script seems rushed and some moments lack his usual sense of humor. However, it still offers some genuinely hilarious moments and is well worth the 90 minutes."
3,An underated gem!,"I'm often accused of being a prude and a misery guts and I'm no way a fan of teen comedies. But I really enjoyed this movie. It was very gross in parts and just plain daft in others but it was enjoyable. The guy trying to see the 'sailboat' in the magic-eye picture is simple but hilarious. There are a few dud scenes such as the romantic side, but besides that it is a very funny film."
5,Great!,"There is so much on this disc that I didn't know about... like the original beginning! But now when I watch the movie, I forget about the current beginning, and think that I'm watching what was supposed to be released. There are a whole bunch of little bits and pieces that were tweaked so that they would be correct in the new film, and now you can pick them all out."
3,truly enjoyable...,"This is a show for the misunderstood slacker in all of us. It had so many things in it that made me laugh. The best thing I liked about the film was the cutting-edge dialogue...and running-gags. Especially, with the guy who is trying really hard to 'see' something, I don't want to blow it for you...but I can totally relate to his frustration!The cameo of Stan Lee was awesome for those of us comic lovers, and you can't go wrong with all of the behind-the-scenes stuff. Its always amazes me how much is left out of a film, and I was glad to see some of the shots that were cut, I could see why...it just made the film better.I liked the supporting cast better than the main cast for some reason, they seemed more developed in my opinion. Jay and Silent Bob were a crack-up. I want to see 'Clerks' now.Not a show for kids, of course, some of the dialogue is just too raw.Overall, this is totally worth seeing at least once."
3,The Worst from Smith but still funny,"Mallrats is a likable comedy. It's the kind ofmovie John Hughes made on 80's and I like that films (and Kevin obvious liked it too), have a great cameo by stan lee and a solid lead performance by Jason Lee, but when i watched it thought something is missing. The thing that made Chasing Amy and Clerks special films, the problem is that the carachters here isn't as likable as Dante or Holden or Banky or Randall. We laught with it but we really didn't care much for them."
4,"A funny, funny movie!","In this second movie of the Jersey Trilogy, Kevin Smith again shows a realistic portrayal of everyday issues and problems faced by todays youth. Also mixed in is a healthy dose of comic relief. A couple of the main actors were a bit weak, but overall a strong indie movie. When watching, sit back and relax...enjoy yourself. Its supposed to be fun."
5,...they're not there to shop or work. they're just there...,"This was a good movie! My favorite line of it was ""That girl is only 15!"" Ben Affleck is a hell of an actor, even in this movie, playing an @$$hole. If you liked ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", you'll love ""Mallrats""!"
3,Worth seeing just because it's part of the trilogy.,"It's not great. It has alot of fun scenes, tho, and is a MUST if you want to fully appreciate Kevin's third film ""Chasing Amy"". See ""Clerks"" first."
5,One of the greatest,"This is a great movie. Critics disn;t like it and gave it bad reviews. They said it was childish. It was meant to be that way. It even says so on the dvd. The movie is hillarius. It is a about two guys and their adventures in a local mall. Some are funny, others are obnoxios like the topless fortune teller. If you fell bad or just wan;t a good laugh buy this classic movie.""Snootie Boochies"" -Jay"
1,HD?,"This HD-DVD was far from high def. The movie it self is great, and will be a classic, but the HD-DVD format in which this movie was re-released on is lacking."
5,Great film!,I've been updating my dvd collection and I'm glad to have finally gotten this. Had pretty much all of Kevin Smith's films and this was one of my favorites.
5,Good choice,"Perfect condition. Box is a little bigger than normal blu-ray but that's because they do not make this movie on blu-ray in the US yet. Totally understandable, still a perfect blu-ray."
3,"Love the movie, Hate the format. 6 stars for the film, 0 for the format","I bought this HD digital copy, thinking that I could download it and watch my favorite movie on my PC. That is not true. You can not watch the HD version on anything but the Kindle, or some other peace of amazon proprietary technology. If you want to watch the movie on you'r lap top or another non Amazon device, you are forced to stream the standard definition version of the move. You can't download the movie, and you can't even watch it in HD, don't waste you'r money here. Buy the move, but in a different format that doesn't stink. I paid extra for HD, and have not been able to use it because of the greedy decisions made by amazon"
4,"""Would you like a chocolate covered pretzel?""","Critics panned Mallrats as Kevin Smith's sophmore slump after his surprise critical hit Clerks, but while Mallrats may not be Kevin Smith's finest effort, its still hilarious. Jason Lee plays comic book nut and Sega NHL freak Brodie Bruce, and Jeremy London plays his pal T.S. Both get dumped by their girlfriends (Shannen Doherty and Claire Forlani respectively), so both decide to go to the mall to get their minds off of being dumped. While there they meet up with good 'ol Jay & Silent Bob, and wind up seeing their exes in the mall as well. What follows is a plan for both of them to get they're girls back, and funny hijinks. While Mallrats doesn't offer an underlying theme like Clerks and Chasing Amy did, it does have blasts of Smith's irreverant comedy, which makes Mallrats a great movie, but certainly not Smith's best. The cast also includes Ben Affleck (before he hit it big), Joey Lauren Adams, Michael Rooker, and Marvel Comics icon Stan Lee."
5,Welcome to Camp,"Kevin Smith did almost ridiculously well with his premiere film, Clerks, and followed with the film you see here. Panned by critics, loved by hard-core Askewheads, Mallrats is disappointing on many levels (it abandons the most intelligent aspects of Clerks and misses the polish that came in with Chasing Amy), but it's probably Smith's most amusing and lighthearted movie, and definitely the best introduction for someone unfamiliar with Smith (they're still out there!). In addition, the commentary on this DVD reveals Smith's limitations by Gramercy (they wanted the ""intelligent Porky's"" marketability). Typical sophomore slump stuff. Good way to see early Ben Affleck as the alpha-male Shannon, and early Jason Lee as well. Worth the money.When do I get to see the sailboat, God?"
3,Second base,"Smith's second effort, and likewise, lost between his independent premier in Clerks, and the better-known and produced Chasing Amy. However, Mallrats has its own in-jokes on the mall culture, just as the other two movies skewered retail and the comics industry, respectively. As such, take this one as its own piece. Guys lose girls, guys go to ridiculous ends to get girls back. But this isn't John Hughes here, folks. Somewhere between the raunchy jokes of Clerks and the tragicomic of Chasing Amy. Although all three movies stand alone, viewing them in order is useful to watch for cross references and the use of recurring actors, such as Mewes, Smith (himself), Affleck and Adams."
4,Great lowbrow movie for the younger crowd,"Sure the plot is predictable and a little overused, but the movie is still very funny. Kevin Smith (director) loves dialog-rich movies and this is no exception. It deals with a couple of guys pining over their recently lost girlfriends and scheming to win them back. These two have funny expositions on relationships (and superheroes). Jay and Silent Bob (two background characters from all of Smith's movies) appear here as well to offer their unique assistance. Jay is crude and uses lots of foul language (so beware if that offends you). But Jay and Bob serve as a great subplot to the movie. Don't take it seriously, it's just a fun movie."
3,The One Klunker Out Of Kevin Smith,"I absolutely loved Clerks. Chasing Amy and Dogma are both in my top 10 list of favorite movies of all time. I simply cannot WAIT for Smith's next installment, whatever it may be.This film was mediocre at best. If you crossed Clerks with ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" or ""Wayne's World"", you'd get Mallrats. I sometimes like that kind of movie, but the mixture of Smith with that genre does not work.Buy this work only if you love Smith's work so much that you have to own everything he's done. I almost do, but not quite. :)"
5,Deserves more than 5 stars,"I love this movie, when I saw the DVD version and Kevin says what a failure it was at the theaters and all that, who cares, this movie was hilarious, well written, love the cast, even though I'm not a fan of Shannon Doherty. Kevin Smith is my only favorite director, I read, watch anything that is associated with his name, which by accident brings up the Hercules Kevin Smith. I could care less about what critics say, they are usually over the hill people that are into the Titanic, Monster, crap. I was 18 when I saw this movie and still love it to this day, not to mention this tubby b@tch loove's Kevin Smith. I don't think he should close the chapter on Jay and Silent Bob, there is a audience like me that loves his work."
5,"Kevin Smith's most underrated film (besides Jersey Girl, of course)","Mallrats gives us a viewing of a day in the life for two teenagers, T.S. and Brodie, as they wander around all day in a local mall while the girls who recently dumped them do the same. The two guys encounter characters like Jay, Silent Bob, 15-year old sex novel author Trish the Dish, 3-D visionally challenged Willam (the guy just wants to see the sailboat!) and many others. T.S. and Brodie have decided that they will attempt to win back the hearts of their ex-girlfriends before scumbags like Brodie's arch nemesis Shannon Hamilton get to have sex with them in very uncomfortable places, while Jay and Silent Bob attempt to wreck one of their ex-girlfriend's father's game show in the meantime."
1,Mallrats,MALLRATSLousy acting and contrived dialogue. Glad that they finally learned their lines by the end of the movie. Should be listed as one of the worst movies ever.
5,Hilarious and Entertaining?,This movie is a classic! It's funny and i never really like that many movies that take place at one location throughout the whole film but for mall films this one is the best and I mean the BEST! It is like a living breathing comic strip and a true collector's item for their DVD library when they are looking to soop up their comedy section. This is one you should have!
5,Hilariously Funny Movie!,"This movie is very funny. T.S and his girlfriend Brandi are about to go on vacation to Florida where he was going to purpose. Brandi can't go because of a game show her father is producing Truth or Date. T.S reacts to this and they break up. Broadie a lazy comic book store owner. He also breaks up with his girlfriend Rene. This movie takes place in a mall. The gameshow Baandi will be on is in the mall and is live. As Broadie tries to break up Rene and Shannon, her new boyfriend, T.S tries to stop the gameshow. This is where Jay and Silent Bob come in. They help stop the gameshow in this very funny movie. This movie is HILARIOUS! Don't waste your money on anything else buy this movie!"
1,Really shotty merchandise,"I bought the dvd for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. When he played the dvd is frooze and then skipped to the end of the movie. I have tried contacting someone to get the dvd replaced, but no one has contacted me. This is by far the worse purchase I have made."
1,Gets Worse As It Goes,"This plays like a bad Kevin Smith film.And it already IS a bad Kevin Smith film. Lame script, cluttered dialogue, amateurish acting. Not one character is interesting or funny enough to garner any sympathy.For all the reviews that criticize the critics or can't genuinely understand why this is considered one of Kevin Smith's worst movies...it's because this movie SUCKS. You either have the comic sensibilities of a 7-year-old or you're a stoner who's reduced him or herself to motor responses.It's not us...it's you."
3,A film about..... well nothing,"Two guys get dumped. One is a college student who has the intensity of a doorknob, the other is a comic book fanatic who somehow thinks the mall is 'his'. So they go to the mall for the day. They have somewhat interesting little adventures and we meet almost interesting characters. We got the 15 year old girl who does sex research, a dude who can't see the sailboat in those crazy posters that were all dots, and a mall security guy who wears a 1920's era straw hat.The 'climax' of this film is when the college guy gets his girlfriend back at the mall while getting onto a dating game show being held at the mall, that just so happens to be run by her father. He of course gets food poisoning from 'ass pretzels'.Jay and Silent Bob run amock and we even get to see a female topless fortune teller with an edible third nipple.This flick is good for a few chuckles, but it's pretty much forgetable."
1,"Cheesy, Forgettable Piece","I cannot believe people find this movie entertaining. Compared to the others in the NJ trilogy, this one lacks spontaneity, and jokes aren't really funny; I can almost see the author of the script *trying* very hard to make us laugh. Sorry, but once I knew his intention, I didn't feel like buying it. Oh, and the way things all ended up going well with the main characters' relationships with their girlfriends made me cringe so hard that I pulled the muscle in my lower back."
5,A must for any Kevin Smith fan,"Well, yes, this movie remains infamous in a love-it-or-hate-it way, but if you're a fan of Kevin Smith's work, this DVD is a must for the incredible wealth of ancillary materials available on it. From the hilarious and informative commentary track (the studio wanted Seth Green or Breckin Meyer to play Jay?) to the deleted scenes to the interviews to the stills to the ""Build Me Up, Buttercup"" video, no inhabitant of the View Askew-niverse can afford to NOT have this gem in his or her collection."
4,Good...but not Smith's best,"Mallrats is a great comedy. It was just extremely funny through-out. Every character played a part, and all had a mission. I mean, for one, it has a character that sits in front of a 3-d picture of a sailboat for weeks and can never see it. And the beginning of the movie about Walt Flanigan and his many cats was awesome. This is a really funny movie. Though it isn't Smith's best..."
3,Much better than its reputation suggests,"Kevin Smith's tribute to John Landis attempts to be the Animal House of the 90's. (Silent Bob's pantomime antics are nicely reminiscent of Belushi's near-wordless performance as Bluto, for instance.) And while Smith may have fallen short of his goal - this film lacks the nonstop hilarity of Animal House - it's still a highly entertaining diversion, especially for those who appreciate Smith's style of humor."
2,Kevin Smith can do better,"This isn't Kevin Smith's best work but I did laugh at a few parts, it really isn't worth bying. but I'm glad Kevin Smith said he was sorry for making this movie at some Award show. His other movies like ""Clerks"", ""Chasing Amy"", and ""Dogma"" are really good and worth bying I give all those movies 5 stars,and I can't wait untill ""Clerks 2:Hardly Clearkin"" comes out.The only thing that really made the movie funny was Jay and Silent Bob. I like Jason Lee in ""Chasing Amy"",""Dogma"",and ""Mumford""(even though Kevin Smith didn't make that one),but in this one he just didn't work for me.I like in Kevin Smith movies how at the end of the credits it says what movie Jay and Silent Bob will be in next, and I'm still a big time fan of Kevin Smith movies and I'm still happy Kevin Smith said he was sorry for making this movie."
2,The weakest of the Jersey Trilogy,"As a big booster of Kevin Smith's, it was with a heavy heart that I had to admit that MALLRATS was a misconceived little ditty that relied too much on slapstick and not enough of the verbal humor that made CLERKS and CHASING AMY such wonders to see and hear. The verbal sparring is present in this film as well, but is often mired in silly action sequences, tips of the hat to comics and other films, and a buffoonish take on the Jay and Silent Bob characters. Heck, even Smith himself took shots at MALLRATS's silliness in CHASING AMY. It seems that Kevin was finding his voice with this one,which is basically a more vulgar send up of John Hughes teen-angst dramedies, yet he more than redeemed himself with the stellar CHASING AMY. Overall, a misfire, peppered with some funny dialogue."
5,Best version to date.,"First time i picked up on vhs, then laserdisc, still later dvd and now HD-DVD.Wish i could have seen this on the big screen, but now that i have this disc i cansay that i don't feel like i missed out. It's just scary the detail. It will stay inmy collection.AAA+++great HD DVD"
4,Great Kevin Smith movie,"I think this might be one of the better Kevin Smith movies out. It is one of my top ten comedy movies of all times. Although the movie doesn't make much sense you just have to understand that Kevin Smith isn't usually trying to make sense, just trying to make you laugh."
2,Smith;s love of Comic Books....,"Kevin Smith's love of comic books shows in this movie. The best scene is where Stan Lee does a brief camero, and that's it. The rest of the movie is worthless."
2,It's not worth it,I looked at some reviews online before buying that said that the blu ray for Mallrats had the same material as the 10th Anniversary DVD. Maybe some other blu ray release did but this one did not. It has no special features and worse yet it's a Universal Studios blu ray which means you have to go through the fuss and bother of selecting a language and go through the Universal promos before getting to watch the thing and if you have a temperamental remote for your blu ray player like I do then you may have to go through this process a few times. Aside from that the picture and audio is pretty much the same. So basically if you just want Mallrats as a blu ray just because you like the color blue and want to add to the color on your shelf then this is for you.
5,This is for Brodie!,"Rarely have I ever enjoyed a goofball comedy so much as I enjoyed Mallrats. It was clever, original and relaxed, allowing its comedy to roll on its own, never keeping it within boundaries, but always keeping comprehensible. The result? A terribly silly storyline, unneccesary plot diversions and a cast of undeniably memorable characters. This movie does not appear to be very special on the outside, but once you get down to it, every tiny detail is thought out and planned beautifully. Jason Lee's Brodie was the highlight of the movie, even managing to leave the usually over-poweringly special Jay and Silent Bob behind in the laugh-o-meter. Although by no means is this dry, witty, mature humor, it is extremely enjoyable, and nearly flawless as far as the genre goes. I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to leave their maturity behind and just enjoy a good comedy."
5,KEVIN SMITH'S GREATEST MOMENT TO DATE,"This movie is in a word Great. i loved it 'clerks' was very funny this just jumps off the board and into the deep end. it goes were not even American Pie dared go. buy this movie in fact buy all of kevin's movies,"
1,I couldn't finish it.,"This was an ultimately unwatchable film. Despite an ensemble who almost all have progressed well and excelled, they are here spun into annoying over-literate unbelievably intellectually expansive proto-typical 90's slacker almost adults...I lasted about 45 minutes.I do give Kevin Smith credit, he cranks out films he's written and stamps them with a distinct energy and perspective. That certainly positions him as a artist, and a sort of visionary. But his visions in the first 45 minutes of Mallrats are boring, directionally slack, structurally flabby and not entertaining."
1,Kevin Smith's worst movie ever,"What was Kevin Smith doing starring and directing in this mess. there's no plot or funny bits that makes Clerks and Dogma so hilarious .the cast is good and the the cameo by comic book drawer Stan Lee is terrific,but the movie is so stupid to follow,the plot stinks what plot there's only two slackers that hang at the mall and be stupid,this movie tries to be like Clerks and fails,Jason Lee and Jeremy London take over Randall and Dante's roles that Kevin Smith should have called MALLCLERKS.0 stars for this.watch Clerks or Dogma."
1,No Stars! Really!!,"I watched the prequel (CLERKS) to this garbage, and I must say that the original basiclly failed but this film should be considered as total druggie fluff.Where did the director and writter Kevin Smith leave the story, as well as his head, when he came up with the idea of Mall Rats.The scene in which the two lamo's see the fortune teller and she tell's their future buy reading her third breast says it all. It's not funny at all, no story and no acting whatsoever. And for all you people who think Kevin Smith is some sort of a Movie God, get real! How can you people even think that the inept Kevin Smith can release worthwhile films (other than films of the Ed Wood caliber) is beyond me. Kevin Smith (blah!) Quentin Tarantino is by far the better director, and does have oscar nomionations to prove it."
3,Not as bad as I've heard...,"Mallrats (1995) - Kevin SmithIt seems that out of all of Kevin Smith's Jay and Silent Bob films, this one has received the most negative reviews. Even my favorite film critic, Roger Ebert, gave this a 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Personally, I can't see why. Sure, it's not Kevin Smith's best film (that award goes to either Clerks or Chasing Amy), and its definitely not a great film, but its also not nearly as bad as a lot of critics make it out to be. I find the dialogue relatively witty, the interplay between the characters fun, and the minor romantic elements charming, at the least. Yes, the plot is relatively vapid, the acting is bad, and the overall refinement is a little lacking. However, I feel that all of it just adds to the overall charm. Thus, I would recommend that one at least check it out before immediately dismissing it."
4,smoochies boochies!,"This is my first Kevin Smith movie, so i cant really compare to clerks or chasing amy. But this movie was great. It was cleverly thought out by Kevin Smith and i can see now why there is such a cult following from him. The movie has plenty of one liners and offensive talk to keep you laughing. Reccomended to everyone looking for a good laugh thats at least 15 years old. Kevin smith was hilarious as was the rest of the cast, and the ending (the game show) was the best part in the movie."
2,"Good promise, bad delivery","This movie looked so promising and started out OK, but things went downhill fast. I figured it would be good, simple entertainment...but it was just a frustrating movie to watch. The writing is inconsistant, with poorly developed characters who seem to keep changing and a plot that offers pretty good promise but never delivers. The twists seem poorly (or not) thought out, and the ending simply doesn't make sense.I would have rated this movie at a single star had there been no promise, but the movie starts out reasonably well. Too bad it is so badly wasted!"
2,not very good,"this movie starts off well but the flatlines. The plot is cazy w. car races, drug lords and it just takes on too much and nothing that it takes on is very intristing."
3,Disappointing,"Ritchie's guitar tone is awful. Glitchy sounding. I've heard he was mixing his guitar tone with a guitar synth around this period. Unless you are a Blackmore nut, like me, buy the Stuttgart set from the '93 tour. Ritchie plays AND sounds awsome."
3,An unprepared warning shot for the madness to come,"These demos were pressed to CD without the authorization of the band and as a result showcase mostly horrible garage production through which can be heard Sarcofago- and Blasphemy-influenced grinding black metal. This material is for underground maniacs only, where almost anyone with intelligence and an openness to creativity can appreciate the brilliance of ""Drawing Down the Moon"" or the epic symphony ""Electric Doom Synthesis"" which followed."
1,Flying down to the Bahamas,"I was very dissappointed with this video. I was hoping for an information packed guide to flying into the Bahamas, and this video wasn't very helpfull. Also, the home video quality was very upsetting."
5,The best sweet & sour sauce,"Thank you so much for selling the packets!!!!!!!!I used to be able to purchase the packets at my local grocery store, but now they only carry the bottle of liquid sauce & I don't like it as much. Each time I make a purchase I send 1/2 to my mom and keep the rest for my family."
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"I thought this was a hard snap on case but its just a hard silicone type material that slips onto the phone. Its still a decent case, just not what I was wanting."
4,It's okay.,"It protects your phone, and gives it a nice purple hue. The grips are nice on the sides, but if you drop your phone a lot like me, you might be better off getting one of the speck candyshell cases for better shock protection."
3,Heavy Split fins...,Heavy split fins. Not as good as their closed heal versions. The toe is not open and is made of hard plastic. Not comfortable on the foot at all. Requires a lot of effort to propel yourself along.
1,Disappointment,"I've been meaning to give this mask a review. And now, I shall!I got this mask as a gift. And it really sucks that I ended up not liking it. I don't know what went on in the shop/factory/place that made this but it does NOT look like the picture. After hoping for awhile that I'd get a nice bright white and cute mask, I got a white mask with some cream colored areas and a weird pink mole on the upper cheek. This mask looks half-assed, basically. I wish whoever made this would have put in more effort into it because it wouldn't have taken much to make it look the way it's supposed to look."
5,K&N Filter,"There's not much to go wrong here... nothing mechanical... just a good quality filter. The price was below anything else I could find on the web, and as I bought two, free shipping."
2,Product not what I expected.,The vendor sent the item very promptly but the item has too much water in it and causes my hair to frizz up a lot. I will not purchase this product again.
2,Disappointing,My hair is texturized (black hair) and I tried this product to maintain the curls and moisture. Looks good for the first maybe 1 hour but dries out very quickly and leaves hair looking dry and not groomed. Smells great though.
1,Hopeless !!!,Its 0 star item. Please dont waste money if you are beatles real fan. Meaningless title.
1,not too happy,"HI, i really liked the ring, but i only wore it a few times before it broke. broke on the back side. I then lost it before i could exchange it. :-( oh well, good service though. Thanks, Barb"
1,Review of Black & Decker Iron,"Having had the iron for only a couple of weeks, on November 3, 2007, the iron no longer turned on. There was no trauma to the iron; it had never been dropped; it just refused to turn on.Obviously, I am not a happy purchaser even after doing due diligence research at Consumer Reports."
4,Where is this soundtrack?,"I first heard the theme song to this movie back in the 60's on the radio in my mother's car. I've looked, but I can't find the theme song or the soundtrack anywhere. Anyone know where to find it? I watch the movie just to hear the music!"
3,Feel-good film for the French,"At almost three hours, this is too long by half. Padded with many battles scenes interspersed with actual WW2 footage, the movie tells the tale of French resistance in Paris in the last days of WW2 when the Nazis almost destroyed the city out of spite. It's a miracle they didn't. The Gore Vidal script is above average, but some of the acting, especially by the Americans like Kirk Douglas is a bit lame. Orson Wells comes off OK as the Swiss ambassador who tries to talk sense into the Nazi general in charge of Paris. This actually includes a 5 minute intermission. They don't do those anymore."
4,"Great movie, lousy DVD","The movie is a classic, no doubt about that.While the film's visual transfer to DVD is fine, even excellent, the audio and subtitles are horrible.This is one of those unusual films which includes dialogue in both English and French. One wants, for example, to hear Glenn Ford speaking English. But the DVD offers *only* all English or all French, in other words, no original soundtrack.Compounding the problem, the English subtitles were evidently written by someone who isn't a native speaker of either English or French, and who may not have even been watching the movie. Every other sentence is mistranslated. Times are altered. Names are altered. Odd sentences are added that aren't in the dialogue. It's just bizarre -- I've never seen anything like it.So four and a half stars for the movie, but only two stars for the DVD transfer."
1,UNHAPPY WITH DVD,WAITED A MONTH FOR DELIVERY AND WENT CRAZY USING DIFFERENT DVD PLAYERS TO TRY TOWATCH IT BUT IT WILL NOT PLAY. EVEN CONTACTED SONY BLU RAY FOR HELP BUT THIS DVD IS A(PAL 2) THAT DOES NOT WORK HERE?? VERY DISSAPOINTED HOWARD MOUNT
2,Is Paris Burning?,Overlong and boring movie...sat through it only because I had purchased it. It's outdated...the performances are okay...the action is the best part of the movie...still...not a movie I would recommend.
2,Hollywood missed the point,"Hollywood took this incredible novel of courage and cunning and turned it into a war epic filled with famous stars who appear for a minute or two only. In the waning days of World War II, Hitler ordered the total destruction of Paris. His general in command of Paris did as little as possible to carry out this order, even advised the allies that they would be welcomed with token resistance. Direct orders to the Luftwaffe to bomb Paris were ignored as well. There was an incredible spontaneous disregard of the Fuhrer's plans to destroy Paris. And when the Allies refused to march to Paris, the French Army left for Paris against orders in the dead of night, forcing Patton to race after them. Apparently, this fantastic story was too dull for Gore Vidal and a young Francis Ford Coppola, who opted instead to write a two dimensional war story about how the Americans and British bailed out the French resistance. Read the book!"
2,Vast collection of articles,Always very funny - put together in a book which is the type which you can open on any page and read an article for a giggle. As he says - it would be great to leave in the lavatory to read at your leisure!
4,Funny more often than not,"I bought this as a gift for a friend, who just happens to be an expectant mother. She was showered with ""how to"" books on raising babies, so I thought I would give her one more -- the Dave Barry guide. I started reading it, and ended up chuckling more often than not. A recommended read to someone who wants a laugh, and enjoys Dave Barry's outrageous writing style."
2,Not Barry's Best,"I have read (and loved) almost all of Dave Barry's books but this one was a disappointment. I didn't even finish it. Maybe the subjects (babies, marriage...) just didn't grab me but I would recommend many of his later books over this one."
5,"Heart-wrenching, inspiring film","Real-life dramas always hold more weight with me, especially when they are crafted as well as ""Lorenzo's Oil."" The acting is superb and the drama unfolds very carefully and deliberately. I was immediately drawn in. Having known families torn apart by the illness of a child, for me this film captures the paralyzing grief and sense of helplessness that paralyzes a household, and yet this film gives hope when the family starts to fight back against the disease.Like Augusto did encountering the disease, I discovered I had learned a great deal just watching the film. I wish more films could be as educational and entertaining at the same time -- a rare breed indeed!If you haven't shed at least a few tears by the end of the film, I'm worried about you if you can get tear-free through the closing montage of boys who are alive and well because of Lorenzo's Oil. Everytime I see that part, I cry."
4,Lorenzo today,"Lorenzo is now 18 years old and has continued to progress. He now can perform simple actions upon request, such as ""pulling his arm across his chest."" His parents, Augusto and Michaela Odone, maintain the Myelin Project, a non-profit Foundation which not only reports on current research, but encourages the development of cures for demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis and ALD. Their courageous hope is that the combined power of concerned citizens and clinical and laboratory researchers will end these debilitating conditions. There are several avenues of cutting-edge research summarized at the site."
5,Excellent,"Movie shows how desperate people can be for cures for their medically fragile children. This is a very realistic look at people and how they would react to this kind of crisis.As a father of a child with autism, I have observed some of the same reactions in the autism community. GOTTA FIND A MIRACLE CURE....GOTTA FIND A MIRACLE CURE!!!!Acting is excellent in this film...it never got the BIG attention it deserved.Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of ""Our Brown-Eyed Boy"""
1,European,"I did not realize before I ordered this movie that it would not play in regular American DVD players, but it is a good movie (if I ever get to watch it)."
1,Very Disappointed,"I looked forward very much to receiving the DVD, Lorenzo's Oil, as it is based on a true story and I had heard about it from a family member who really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, I did not look at the movie as soon as I should have so when I finally got around to doing so was disappointed that it would not play on any of my DVD players. In searching the cover I discovered in very, very fine print that it was made for showing in the EU region of the world, so of course it did not work in North America. It would have been nice to know ahead of time that this item was not appropriate for my use. It did arrive in a timely manner and was in very good condition. However, I have given it one star because I have not been able to check it out past that point.Another item which I ordered from the same seller arrived with no incidents and no issues, so it seems this was an unfortunate oversight on their part."
1,My family has ALD,"I saw this movie but was hesitant. WHY????...This film was not at all factual, the oils do NOT work, we tried them. My heart went out to the family and to Lorenzo, but to say he can move his index finger, where is the aulity of life I ask you?My heart aches each day... and I am deeply angered by this movie."
5,One of my favorite movies of all time.,"As a scientific researcher myself, this is a very motivational movie. It goes to show that medical science is not just about understanding immunology or breakdown of muscle fibers, but also about will and determination. Recommended to everyone."
5,Touching,"I really think this movie is touching because it shows us how weak we are, sometimes. The Odones are very brave, all of them, from the parents to the kid. I hope the scientists can now be more flexible than they were with Mr. and Mrs. Odone. Congratulations to them!"
4,College class use,This video has been used with excellent results in research classes I teach at a local college. I just needed a new copy.
2,DVD quality is not as good.,"The story is very touching, but the DVD quality did not match with the price that I paid.There were several stops occurring while the DVD is being played.The price has to be dropped a lot more so as to match with the quality."
2,Fine - if you drink your coffee immediately,"My wife and I drink a lot of coffee throughout the day. We got this product hoping that it would keep coffee reasonably warm for long periods of time. The problem is, the moment it comes out of the brewer it's barely hot. If you set your cup down for 5 minutes, it'll be tepid. After 10 minutes, it's cold. We've decided to keep our old one and just bought a simple carafe to pour the coffee into to keep warm. So far, it seems to be a process that works for us until we find something better.Also, there were several instances where coffee grounds overflowed from the basket into the carafe, as well a couple of instances where it made a mess all over the counter. The latter I chalked up to user error where we probably didn't have the door closed enough...maybe.In summary, this coffee maker is tolerable, but it has its problems. If you get a good one and drink you're coffee immediately after pouring it, you might be happy with this unit."
3,"Cuisinart DTC-975 Programmable Automatic Brew-and-Serve 12-Cup Thermal Coffeemake, Black","Arrived quickly at an excellent price, and after a month seems to serve its purpose quite well. I think the thermos might be a better utility than a hot plate, because coffee is volatile, and a hot plate only keeps the flavorful oils evaporating steadily after a half-hour."
4,Very nice coffeemaker,"Works great - keeps coffee hot for extended period without getting ""old"" tasting. only issue is the lid needs to be put on carefully so the hard to read ""pour"" ends up lined up with the spout. Once you get the hang of that - the coffeemaker is great."
1,look elsewhere,"Poorly designed, awkward to fill, basket does not swing out easily, and much more aggervating is it does not fall into place easily, it needs to be manipulated into the correct spot or there will be a coffe mess everywhere.There always seems to be a mess anyways, the pause feature does not work well, there is always drips. Pouring is slow with dribbles from the pot downthe carafe. That annoying beeping sound when the coffe is done is louder than my alarm clock..I hate it!!"
5,Wonderful value!,"I was so surprised by the quality and value of this coffee maker. It works great! I was apprehensive to buy a ""remanufactured"" product, but it has been wonderful...... Can't beat the quality for this price! I bought one as a gift and we're all very pleased."
4,So far So good,only had it for a month so how long it will last is unknown! I like it a lot so far and as for keeping coffe warm I dont know why some dont find it good as it keeps my coffee just fine. Makes fine coffee and well worth the price..
4,Fabulous,"This is a wonderful coffeemaker. It has a metal lining in the carafe so it is almost indestructable. I like the programable features, and it makes great coffee."
1,overflow is a problem on the 10cup version,"We are going to give up on this one and buy a new coffee pot.This one works well except for the catastrophic overflow problem. You MUST get the basket inserted so that everything clicks. Also you can get overflow if you don't get the top screwed back on just right. You must check that by carefully sighting at carafe level. The top screws on quite nicely in the incorrect way, it is much more difficult to get it right.You need a couple of cups of coffee before you are awake enough to use this coffeemaker.I abhor bad design, especially when the flaws lead to nonrobustness in normal use. This product is badly designed."
1,Worst coffee maker,"If wiping up the floor, and cleaning your countertop is what you would prefer to drinking a nice cup of coffee in the morning than this is the one for you. As I unfortunately discovered on other sites after I burned myself cleaning up after this piece of garbage, this machine will dump water and grinds all over the place if the basket is the slightest bit askew.Emails to Cuisinart go unreturned.DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE"
4,works for me,"I had NONE of the problems a few other purchasers mentioned. I love my coffe maker. It is simple to use, simple to set up and program, and makes great coffee. It also keeps coffee hot for HOURS! I have had steaming hot coffee left in the pot (from 7:00 a.m.), when I got home and set it up for the next day twelve hours later. I recommend this product highly, and am purchasing one for my Mother."
4,Great Coffeemaker,I have gone through many coffeemakers. This one works as good as any. No problems so far with leakage or overflows. Coffee comes out very hot and stays that way. Highly reccomended.
3,Cuisinart Design Issues,"From the posts about coffee spills and my own experience I must say that there is a design deficiency allowing misaligned basket insertion. Also when pouring, I find it slow, and if tipping the pot too far, coffee dribles out of the hole that is used during the brew cycle. I should have listened to the reviews before I bought this unit."
4,Good if you're careful,This does keep the coffee hot to the last drop for hours unlike others. However after several pots of coffee on the floor in the morning I discovered that if any grounds find their way to the top of the thermal pot it causes it to overflow all over the floor.
2,"Great taste, messy counters","W jumped on this product as it was the first one on the block with a 12 cup capacity in a thermal caraffe. BUMMER! The counters never seem to be dry, or clean! The Coffee maker overflows at the drop of a hat. The Manufacturer responded very nicely to our emails, and sent a new lid, and cone. But this did not come close to solving the problems! I am now finally looking for a new coffee pot."
1,Crappy coffee maker,"In the past, I've had very good luck with reconditioned items that I've purchased from Amazon Prime. I've only had to send one item back in the years I've done business with Amazon.I am totally disenchanted with Cuisinart. I have their coffee grinder (which sucks, separate review), and I had to send this puppy back. Why? The swing away door where you tuck the filter and coffee grounds did not stay shut. It was out of alignment, and the whole coffee maker looked so cheap in general, that I felt that it would not even be worth $75 brand new.I am pleased with Amazon's no-hassle return policy.I wound up buying the Bunn, and now I'm living happily ever after."
4,Cuisinart is a champ!,"This coffeemaker is excellent. I have used it for several months and it has performed flawlessly. It brews up 56 oz. of wonderful hot coffee at 170 degrees. After three hours, the temp dropped only 5 degrees to 165. After ten hours it was still a drinkable 145 degrees. The cone shaped filter basket seems to brew more concentrated coffee than the flat basket Black & Decker Thermal coffeemaker I used before.Two small issues: 1) The lid is a bit tricky to screw on squarely, and 2)the pour is a bit slow. This is probably a function of the excellent thermal properties of the lid and worth the wait. I have not experienced any of the overflow issues that others complained about - even when the lid is misthreaded.Overall a terrific coffeemaker that is dependable and delivers great coffee."
3,Cuisinart Thermal Coffeemaker,"We bought this so the guests at our B & B could take their coffee outside to the view deck. We use very fine espresso grind and that can be a problem. The water doesn't go through the coffee fast enough and overflows. However, if I use a coarser grind, it works fine. The other solution is to brew in my other Cuisinart coffee maker and pour that batch into the Thermal Coffeemaker...then the coffee stays hot and the outside of the Thermal Coffeemaker is not hot and can be carried outside.Betty, Casa Montaña Bed & Breakfast, Redstone, Colorado"
5,Coffe Maker of My Dreams,"My two thermal carafe Black/Decker coffee makers crashed. I usually buy my maker's at Kohl's but they no longer stock the B/D I wanted. Then out of cyber space comes this offer from Amazon. Perfect, Cuisinart for $30??! No way! WAY!

5,AUGUSTUS AND THE RIVER,"I first read AUGUSTUS books in elementary school circa 1940s. Augustus books introduced me to the many sections of USA. I learned to value new cultures as I travel through life.The drawings of Augustus' family, new friends, modes of travel are endearing."

4,Feeling better. Is it the Bach Flower Essence?,"At the recommendation of my acupuncturist, I tried the Bach Flower Essence, specifically the Oak. The Bach website [...] does a good of helping determine which essence might be the best match for your issues. I am feeling better and feel that the Bach Flower Essence is a part of the my overall regimen."
5,Randall Price Does It Again,"Seemingly co-incidental circumstances allowed young Randall to be excused from college for a free two-week trip to Israel. The morning before he was to leave for home in the U.S., he saw a note posted on the bulletin board of the Arab house in which he was lodging, announcing a protest of small band of orthodox Jews who wanted the Jewish Temple rebuilt on Mount Moriah. He ran down into the Kidron Valley just in time to observe this motley group carrying flags and banners. That was the beginning of a lifelong study of Temple history, it meaning and signficance for the future. He has meanwhile been allowed priviledged access to both Jewish and Muslim sites on the Temple mount.This recently updated edition contains a wealth of information for scholar and layman alike."
4,sorting out the versions of The You and the Now,"The You and the Now has been released in different versions in Canada, France, Germany, and a few months later in the USA. The French 2-CD version includes the EP Évapore and two bonus tracks. Complete track listings are at jorane.com; as of this writing, amazon is somewhat confused."
5,A different slant on strings,"I can't review this objectively as I recorded the Turtle Island String Quartet for this album and worked closely with producer Michael Brook which was a joy. Jorane is very talented and has a different slant on the world in a good way.Want something different to spark your mood, this is it."
3,Where is it?,I would like to say I have read this but it is hard to get. I enjoyed Mr. Simmons first book so wanted the next two. The first and third were easy to find but the second is missing. I first tried ordering from Borders but after no response for 2 months I tried Amazon. It is on back order. Why have the middle book in a series unavailable? It's frustrating.
4,My first Simmons and will not be my last,"Chris Csejthe is a descendent of Bloody Countess Elizabeth Bathory rendered 'undead' by Count Dracula himself. Now, he's not vampire dead--Chris has all the best of both worlds. He can still come out in daylight if he's careful and he is pretty hard to kill, but he's alone--both wife and child are dead.Not for long, though. Elizabeth Bathory has found out that she has a descendent alive and she's going to find him.Oh, and while we're at it, the Shadow Government has developed viruses to end all the US' financial problems. No surprise Bloody Bathory is helping.The plot's somewhat twisted and occasionally can give a reader a slip, but Chris is definitely worth following. He's a man of honor who is trying to do right--not your usual vamp fare at all. Simmons is worth reading and finding more of."
4,weird but entertaining,"For some reason this book kinda reads like a Joss Whedon story, lots of sarcasm and wise cracks. All in all though, it was OK, not great but OK. I am now going to read the first book, having picked this book up on a whim at Waldenbooks."
1,Couldn't finish it!!!,"I was really looking forward to this publication, as I absolutely loved ""One Foot in the Grave"", but I couldn't even finish reading this. I even went back and tried again, but gave up. Too many characters, too many subplots, and too much scientific and voodoo jargon."
2,Not what it appears to be,The photos for this are deceptive. What appears in the photo to be metal is almost certainly plastic with seams running all the way up both sides. the lightly pebbled black hilt is really cheap plastic printed in a leather pattern. The blade a shiny plastic spatula. This should appeal to the under ten set in search of a knight's sword.
2,definitely expect something 10$ to be only 10,"the only metal on it id the guard,blade, and sheath capping. the blade isn't even false sharpened. i would suggest the knights ornamental dress dagger."
1,What???,"Just watched a portion of this DVD. Seems there is a lot of revisionism passing as fact here. The first episode is supposedly based on survivor's accounts at the Board of Inquiry hearings but no one has mentioned Andrews, the ship's designer, who advised the Captain the ship was damaged to the point of sinking. The few passenger accounts seem to be one gigolo with his mistress, one servant girl soaking in a tub, while the crew consisted of the Captain, Bruce Ismay , and a few stokers, engineers, and another fella who cut his own foot off. I'll keep the DVD for grins, but if you're looking for a valid account of the tragedy, I wouldn't get this show."
1,"The Lusitania is a far better, more important ship than the Titanic","The Lus being bombed brought the US into WW1. The Titanic sinking brought no country into anything. This DVD here is a mistake.(Books like ""Did these stories really happen"" prove the Lusitania's greater worth.)"
5,Best tips I have ever read on Grocery shopping!,"All housewifes should have this book! We might think we know it all, but Paul Letourneau's informative booklet will double your savings with his ""insider knowledge"". With 3 children I need all the help I can get. It's a MUST READ!"
3,Overkill,"The plot became meandering when the author introduced secondary ""mysteries"". I felt that the story line was strong enough to sustain maximum interest without the additional diversions. Although RIPTIDE is a good ""read"" even so, it was a disappointing addition to my collection of Coulter's works."
1,One of the Worst Books I Have Ever Read.,This is first book that I've read by Catherine Coulter and if it's any indication of her other work it will be my last. I wish I had read the customer reviews before I had bought the book. Her characters would suddenly change the subject on the dialogue in the middle of a paragraph or a sentence. I kept rereading paragraphs thinking I had missed some key element that would help this all make sense. I hadn't. The characters were juvenile. Her heroine appeared to have a severe case of hyperactivity or a severe personality disorder. The plot was extremely unplausible. This book was truly bizarre.
4,"Suspense, not Romance.","Speech writer Rebecca Matlock is terrorized by a stalker who kills an innocent old lady and shoots the governer in the neck. When police not only don't believe her, but think Becca is involved in the shooting, she flees to Riptide. Adam Carruthers has been asked by Becca's father, Thomas Matlock, to protect her. Thomas had pretended to be dead since Becca was little to protect his family from a vengeful KGB agent.First warning, if you're a fan of Coulter's romantic fiction, you may be disappointed with RIPTIDE. This book is suspense. While there is some romance, it is not romantic suspense (the emphasis is on the mystery, not the romance). It is better than THE EDGE, but it is obvious that Coulter is going mainstream, with more bulk and less romance. The characterization is up to Coulter's usual high standards, and we see old friends Sherlock and Savich again. I see a new readership for Catherine Coulter in the mystery/suspense genre, but I will miss her romantic fiction."
1,worst book ever,"I have read some other books by this author and found them to be ok, but this may be the worst book ever written! The characters, story line, and dialogue were terrible and extremely unbelievable. Don't bother picking this up. It stinks!"
1,Wasted Time Reading and Wasted Time Writing,"It may become obvious that this is my very first review. I was, however, prompted to write after finishing this book. I have read few books in the last five years that were so poorly written and had such a lame plot. Nothing in this book could have been researched. Hopefully, the FBI, CIA or any of the individuals representing those organizations are so inept as portrayed by CC. She could have told this story much better in a short story for a womans magazine. The plot would have made a writer for a soap opera blush. Please no more. I read the hard cover edition."
1,Pass by this one as fast as you can,"The best thing about this book is its cover. That's honestly the most positive thing I can say about it.What's bad about it? Well, let's start with the inane dialogue, which is so bad it would make a writer for the TV show ""Hee Haw"" blush with shame. Then let's move on to the sophomoric descriptions of the geek-turned-Arnold-Schwarzenegger - it's just one example of writing so bad I don't think even Harlequin would publish it.And the plot ... well, it's just not believable, folks. I know you're supposed to suspend your disbelief when reading fiction, but this asks too much suspension of its readers.In short, the lame plot, see-through characters and series of unrealistic events make this book a total waste of the reader's time.This novel is the ""Ishtar"" of literature. Don't touch it with a 10-foot pole."
2,What's this?,"I agree with the other reviewers. For some very odd reason, this just does not sound like Catherine Coulter writing. The dialoge is very stilted,and the plot just doesn't seem to flow along. I liked the story line, tho, and the fact that Sherlock and Savich showed up. But where did Ms. Coulter go??"
1,Disappointing,"I actually finished this book, though, by the time I was half way through, I wondered why I was bothering. To enjoy this story you have to completely suspend disbelief and enter an alternate universe. I don't think that Ms. Coulter did any real research into the working of ANY law enforcement agency before writing this book. If she had, she would realize that most of the events that drive her plot *would not happen*. The worst part was when after she killed off 4 FBI agents, the rest of the bureau was amused by the heroine.By the end of the book I was convinced that the heroine was actually too stupid to live and I was rooting for the killers to win. However, since this book was more romance than suspense, of course, that would not happen."
2,No Patricia Cornwell,"This book was a big disappointment to me. I thought it would be a major suspense novel a la Patricia Cornwell, but it wasn't even close. The characters were all portrayed stereotypically and the dialogue just didn't flow; in fact, it was almost juvenile. Any attempts at humor just fell flat. This is the only novel by Catherine Coulter I've read and I would not be inclined to read another."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I am an avid fan of Ms.Coutlers. Love all her books except this one...flat dialog...unbelievable plots and obstacles...characters have ""character"" but the tying in of scenrios left me wondering if my 16 year old wrote it...so sorry to throw a wet blanket on this one...but it felt like one when I read it...big problem with the line of Sam being kidnapped for 3 days and dad just walking back home with him and no one thinking about why aren't they still worried...too much for me...I bought the book, but donating to library...not worth re-reading for me."
3,Devoted Reader Disillusioned,"I want to start this review by saying that I am a devoted reader of Catherine Coulter. I own every book she's ever written. I was eager to begin Riptide because her books are always so enjoyable. My main annoyance with this book was the dialogue. The dialogue was very choppy and banal. I could tell that Ms. Coulter was striving for the smart and snappy dialogue for which she is well known. In this book, it somehow falls flat. The plot also was not as brisk as normal. The drama was just drawn out too far. The final criminal actually turned out to be a previously unidentified character and the ending is twisted with one more madman. I felt like a victim of blatant plot-manipulation. Die-hard fans: read this book. You get to visit with Sherlock and Savich again. Keep your expectations low and you won't be too disappointed. Wait for the paperback!"
1,HUGE disappointment,"I had never read this author prior to this book, and it is unlikely I will again. The conversations were inane and ridiculous, and the author seemed to use the same phrases over and over. Did an editor actually read this novel before it was published? One of the few books I have actually not finished and never will.I've deleted it from my Kindle.Pass it by. You have better things to do with your time."
2,Not her best work,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Impulse and Beyond Eden, but Riptide is definitely not Coulter's best work. The storyline is fairly good and at times I was very engrossed in the plot. However I did not become too invested in the characters as they were not likeable. The heroine is somewhat annoying as she tries so hard to be strong and tough, but in the end you realize how stupid she actually is. All in all, I would not recommend this book."
1,Apparently anyone can publish a book!,"As a long time mystery reader, I was interested in reading my first book from this author with 42 New York Times best selling novels. Imagine my dismay when after 50 pages, I couldn't bear to continue. This may be the most poorly written book I've ever attempted to read. The premise of the book, the character development and the prose are something I would expect from a fourth grader. It amazes me that this book ever got published- apparently Ms. Coulter is living off of her reputation. The GOOD news is that according to her website, she only writes one book a year. Perhaps when she's not writing she could attend some creative writing and English composition classes at a nearby university."
1,I Can't Believe I Read the WHOLE Thing!,"This book was TERRIBLE! I don't know why I bothered to finish it. The premise wasn't bad to begin with, but the plot was disorganized to me. People and events just sort of appeared from nowhere, like they were thrown in randomly. However, my major complaint was the dialog. It was flat, repetitive, and didn't do a lot to either move the plot forward or develop the characters. Some of it was just stupid. For example ""I know I'm not dead beacuase I would kill for some water. And I don't believe that if someone is dead, she's particularly thirsty. May I please have some water?"" The attempts at ""witty banter"" or ""romantic antagonism"" just didn't ring true at all. I've read a few of her other suspense/ romance novels, and I don't remember them being this stilted. I definitely don't recommend spending your money on this book -- borrow it from the library."
1,"Assine Plot, Insipid Dialog, Unremarkable Characters!","Help, I cannot plod through this book. The dialog is structured for a ten year old. I have read Ms. Coulter in the past and, while she is no candidate for a Pulitzer, her books have been good ""beach reads."" This, however, is deplorable. People do not speak this way in normal conversation; it is much too contrived. I do have one thing to be grateful for and that is this book was borrowed from my local library. I won't even bother trying to give a synopsis of this book. First, you wouldn't believe me, and secondly, it's much too boring and ridiculous. Better luck next time, Ms. Coulter. This novel fits into the category of a Danielle Steele, and that's no compliment!"
2,Didn't Like It,I should've checked it out at the library. The story was not enjoyable and left me with an immense sense of dissatisfaction. The characters are not as compelling as those from The Maze ( love that book). The story line was weak in the sense that the mystery can easily be solved within the first half of the novel by readers. The 'surprise' twist at the end is easy to figure out before it is revealed. Steer clear of this book and spend your money else where.
1,Disappointment on all fronts.,I have read many books by this author and am at a loss for words as to what happened in this book. It seems like this book was written by a elementary school child. This is nothing like her previous books. It was so repetitive and the sentence structure was so odd at times that it was hard to believe it was written by an adult. This book was terrible and remarkably boring.
2,Just skip it,"At the book's beginning the plot is fairly good. As you keep reading it starts to get heavy and dull, but the last 100 pages or so are really boring. The second plot is nonsense and you'll really know who is the bad guy almost as it starts. The main plot is thrilling just the few initial pages, then it gets dull and boring. At least you can skip the last 75 pages of the book or better said you can skip the whole book."
1,A minus tide,"This certainly has mixed reviews. I fall in the negative category. It was all I could do to finish. During the reading of this fairy tale I can't help but wonder why the author doesn't follow her own theme. First Becca is on her own, no one believes her, then she is totally believed and surrounded by agents watching her every move. They all wear kevlar vests to storm an empty house, except for the corpse of course. Then when they figure the badman is going to spring on them any minute they go for a 3 mile run in the fresh air. A house full of armed agents and the bad man still waltzes in and does what he wants. Where were the kevlar vests then? And one Zippo lighter manages to ignite cloth while everyone is trying to stop him? I could go on and on but you get the message. That's it for this author. Don't we all wish for that magic computer that can just get into everything and find out everything?"
1,I can't believe how awful this book is,"I came to this site about 10 chapters in, just to see if anybody else felt the same way I did about this book. Thank god I'm not the only one who thought this book was awful! I found it had no flow what-so-ever, I found her writing style very hard to follow, the characters meant nothing to me, and I did'nt really care what happened to them. I finally could not take it any more and skipped ahead to the end to find out who the stalker was - just to end my torture. I have never read a Catherine Coulter book before (this one was given to me by a friend) and I never will again! DON'T WASTE YOUR VALUABLE TIME!!"
1,Absolutely a Dreadful Read - THE TIDE IS OUT AND IT STINKS!,"This book is so bad I was moved to right a review. The author neither paints pictures of places or events; no movement, no drama. Not a single interesting character, not a single interesting event. Neither is there a suspenseful or interesting twist in the whole book. I should be commended for finishing the read in hopes of finding something of interest. It's not often I make the effort to share my dissapointments, but spare yourself the effort, even TV reruns of Dragnet are of more interest and suspense. JUST AWFUL!"
3,liked story line,"i liked the story line of this book. i don't think the characters banter was very good, and alot of times i didn't know who was speaking. the plot was great but i have read more engrossing FBI books."
4,A real cliff hanger,"Catherine Coulter is one of my favorite authors. She writes a good mystery story and this one in particular is very suspenseful. It surely kept my interest, and I never anticipated the ending--which was excellentl."
1,book review,Although the book was awesome the quality of the product was horrible. The paperback book literally fell apart in my hands. I had to read it in sections and throw parts of it away as I read it!
2,Not Very Good,"I've enjoyed some of Ms. Coulter's novels featuring Savich and Sherlock, and they continue to be interesting characters. However, the series overall is uneven in quality, and this is not one of the better ones. The dialogue is somewhat stilted, awkward, and just a little odd at times. There are logic leaps in the plot that left me wondering how a character could reach the conclusion reached. ... This book had interesting parts, but after I'd finished it, I was annoyed with it. I know Ms. Coulter can do better, and I wish she would."
2,What was she thinking?,"The main plot was OK but the story was spoiled because the FBI let a civilian, the victim/witness, take over their investigation. I had a hard time swallowing what was going on. In addition, the text and dialog did not flow. I like this author but her heart wasn't in this one."
4,"Another Great Mystery, Solved",I just finished RipTide and found it very compelling. I could not put it down. Ms. Coulter keeps you in suspense to the very end. I was torn as to who did what until the end....her heros and heroines are superb..I love Savich and Sherlock. Another great story from Ms. Coulter.
1,Don't bother,"I have stayed away from Ms. Coulter's books for some time but when I saw this one, I figured I would give it a try. Unfortunately, it was not worthy of her old titles. Her style of writing has changed dramatically over the years and now she continually has everyone yelling at one another trying to make a average statement. The plot of this book was so mixed up with so many characters that I had to go back and forth trying to remember who was who. I gave it a one only for the effort it took her to write it. I won't even bother to give a plot but if you liked the more recent Coulter books, you will probably like this one."
2,"Well, Blah","I have to agree with whomever said they were going to donate the book to the library, I'm heading that way tomorrow. I just finished the book today and I'm not taking any chances on mistakenly re-reading it so out it goes. The story never grabbed my attention, and I never really cared about what happened to any of the characters. I felt sorry for Savich and Sherlock since I enjoyed them in their own story. I was disappointed in the book probably because I've enjoyed most of Ms. Coulter's other works including her historical romances. I think I expected better and was sorely disappointed."
1,RIPTIDE,"A VERY BAD AND BORING READ. A NOVEL,YES, BUT STRECHES CREDIBILTYTO THE MAX. MY FIRST (AND LAST)WITH THIS AUTHOR."
1,"For the love of God, make it stop!","Having invested three weeks of my life to get through 250 pages of this drivel, I am forcing myself to finish it because... oh hell, I don't know why I'm bothering. After reading the other less than stellar reviews posted here, I think I'll put my time to better use cleaning the rain gutters.The dialog is HORRIBLE! I spent most of the past two weeks thumbing back to see if I missed something or to decipher who was speaking (and to whom!). And don't even get me started on the plot. Or should I write ""plots"" because there are approximately 17 of them going at once.My mom gave me this book to read, perhaps in retaliation for my teen years..."
2,So Dissapointed,"I have steadly been disappointed by C.C.'s books. It's like she can't wait to end the story,and theres no build up, it's just there.To read some of her first books, it's hard to believe it's the same author."
2,New Character Type...,"I generally enjoy Catherine Coulter's stories, but I am getting pretty bored with her characters. It seems that they are all various manifestations of the same character (regardless of era). They all talk the same (rather stilted, sort of robot-like), the women all like to hit their men (what is that about??), they all seem to have the same likes, dislikes, predjudices, etc... I'd like to see her introduce some new characters, not give the olds ones new names. It's especially tedious when you have 4 or 6 of them together in the same plot line as in this book (Riptide), some of whom we met in previous stories. Riptide is a basically entertaining story, but I don't think I am going to buy any more of her books - I can re-read the ones I have and get about the same story."
2,Disappointing,"This was my least favorite of the series, mainly because the main female character ""Becca"" wasn't all that likable. Besides the annoying name, she was a loose cannon always going off and doing what she wanted instead of what she was asked/told to do by the professionals who were also becoming her friends. And that they let her get away with all her demands was also unrealistic. The other unrealistic thing was the ""bad guy"" just had wayyyy too much info and power for being an unknown person .... too many federal agents were killed and the case was spread out over so much geographical area and he was always right on top of things .... everywhere. Just didn't buy this one. Have really enjoyed the other books in this series though"
2,Not my favorite,"This book was a quick read, but I didn't really enjoy it. It seemed wordy to me and the protag was willful, headstrong, and down-right dangerous to those around her. I do like strong female characters, but there were really only two characters in the entire story that I liked and they had bit parts. The descriptions were very good of the locations, but the dialogue was choppy and repetitious. I was disappointed in the overall juvenile feel of the story. I have not read the series in order so this could well be a factor, but I'm not sure that I will try the first at this time."
1,Comic relief.,"This book started out okay but the farther I got into it, the more ridiculous it became. I am so glad I didn't buy this book but checked it out from my library. Don't waste your time unless you want absurd dialog and unrealistic plots. Catherine Coulter makes everyone look and sound like brainless idiots with all the silly explanations. The book got so silly that I just started laughing. It's really good comic relief if you don't want a serious mystery to read. Don't buy this book. It's not worth it but for a laugh, check it out at your local library."
5,Characters are alive.,"Reading the book is one that cannot be put down. The characters capture you and lead you through the book with a vision and excitement to continue. You laugh at times, and are mystified at times, but you never want to stop until you get to the next line, next chapter, finish this episode. Before you know it you are through, and can say that you really enjoyed the book from cover to cover."
4,Fast Paced,Catherine Coulter's new book Riptide is a rollercoster ride right from chapter one to the end. Becca Matlock is scared right from the start.She does everything that an ordinary person would do.But there are factors working against her right from the start. Her mothers death. The police that never look beyond their noses and want to blame the victim. A mystery Hunk and a father that she knows nothing about. There are alot of twist and turns and suprises. The book was well worth reading.
3,NOT QUITE,"The 3 stars are for the Basic plot idea. It rambles around a bit, perhaps she tried to write a longer novel..however it would have been MUCH better if she'd tightened it up instead of rambling and sometimes not making any sense at all. Her characters.. again, they are great, simply not fully developed and don't quite become real people. The lines they speak are shallow and cutesy. This style worked well in her historicals, but not in modern romantic suspense. The author thanks Iris Johansen, Kay Hooper and Linda Howard in her dedication. It might help if she read one each of their books and then compared it to one of her historicals. MISS COULTER, Please try again. You start off with great ideas. Sigh..."
4,I enjoyed the book,I am not a romance reader but enjoyed reading this book. The whole book was great but I was very disappointed in the ending.
3,At Least It's Not Boring!,"This book kept me reading on my subway ride to and from work! However, the story of Becca Matlock has wholes ""you can drive a truck through"".The book starts with Becca Matlock, the up and coming speechwriter for a governor, who is being pursued by a murdurous stalker.After that, the book is an interesting but wild roller coaster ride of improbable activity, which is exciting, if nothing else. This is a great book to keep you busy while waiting at airports, and while on an airplane."
1,"Awful, awful, awful","I don't think I could say enough bad things about this book. The dialog was stiff and unnatural. The plot was supremely unbelievable. Not only that, you were annoyed with the underdeveloped, useless characters for the fact that they even believed that such rubbish could be going on around them. There was subplot inside subplot inside subplot, none of which made any sense or tied together in any logical way. Unbelievaly bad. The good news is, it serves to give aspiring authors hope: if this got published, anything can!"
1,"One star is far too high, if that seems possible","I got through about 240 pages of this book. After the first 60 or 80 pages, it was strictly a case of trying too see if Coulter was as bad a writer as she seemed. She was worse! The characters are pure cardboard and the dialogue is inane, and I mean inane. Can you imagine a Maine vacation town called Riptide--why not Shark Beach. Every street is named after a poison flower--how charming! Five minutes after meeting our heroine, her former nerdy, now super stud, college classmate announces that the whole town thinks he murdered his vanished wife. The plot and dialogue remind me of Stuart Woods, who now looks like a great writer by comparison. What a piece of garbage."
1,My first and last Coulter book.,"This is the first book that I have read by bestselling author Catherine Coulter and the worst thing I have read in a long while. Prose so bad I found myself rereading whole paragraphs just to make sure I had read it correctly the first time. It so many ways it reads like a first draft not a finished work. The dialog so stilted it seems to have come the mind of a 14 year old. The reader ends up not caring one whit about the characters or their fate, how does a book like this ever become a best seller? Might I suggest the latest Nevada Barr or Susan Whittig Albert, everything by either of them is great. For Ms. Coulter sake, and her many fans. I hope this book was just a glitch in a long string of bestsellers. I will never know however, because this is my first and last Catherine Coulter book that I am going to read."
2,Dumb characters,"I thought the author said these were some of the CIA and FBI's best operatives. These are the most inept characters I have ever seen. They couldn't guard a dog. The plot didn't come off as realistic or plausible. A high school student could have done better. I gave this book a two star rating because I enjoyed the update on Sherlock and Savich, however, they appeared to have also been struck by the incompent virus. Looking over some of the reviews, I think many readers bought the book based on satisfaction with past books. Authors need to protect their reputations. It is easy to throw a half done effort out to the public and make sales based on past results once or twice, but that won't last forever. These characters and this plot got dumber by the chapter. What a waste!"
2,Meant to be constructive,"I don't normally critique books in this way, however, I would like to give what I hope will be taken as meaningful critique. Becca's character went from unwordly speechwriter to unbelieveable knife weilding, gun toting woman in disguise, and just like that! We didn't need to keep track of all those FBI characters with their ridiculous names. A little bit of dumb cop goes a long way. The plot seemed contrived and not believeable. Russian spys, CIA. Tired. A more well thought out plot and well-rounded characters, and most of all, following basic rules of writing would have improved your novel. Viewpoint changes should be done only when necessary and the dialogue was less than tight. I know you are capable of doing better. None of us are perfect. Better luck next time, Catherine."
1,Horrible,"This was possibly the worst book I have ever read. The plot made no sense, from the absurd names in the town, to the heroine hanging out with a guy who might have killed his wife while being stalked anonymously. Coulter should stick to historical romance, which is what she does best. Hey, there might not be as much money in it, but at least people won't be laughing at her efforts."
1,Boring Bodice-Ripper!,"This trite novel was as closer to a romantic bodice-ripper than a mystery story. The plot was ridiculous, the dialog insipid, and it was a waste of my money!!! I liked her other efforts that featured Savitch and Sherlock, but this was a major yawn and a major disappointment."
2,Disappointed,"Catherine Coulter is a favorite author of mine, I've enjoyed all of her books, however this is the first book of hers that I kept putting down even skipped pages it became so boring. The characters were well formed, but the plot just drug out too long. The ending was no surprise at all, it was so easy to figure out ""Who done it"" by the middle of the book."
4,"A little heavier than expected, hope they provided the wheels to purchase separately","I bought this last Christmas. We haven't used it but already love it, except that it's a little on the heavy side without any food in it. With food and beverages, I imagine it's gonna be really heavy. I now wish I bought the wheeled one. Since I'm stuck with it, I wish I have the option to buy the removeable wheeled cart that goes with the other version. I hope they would sell it."
2,Important!,Please note that the dvd version Amazon is selling has large distracting subtitles which invade the scenes and detract from the movie. There is no way to turn them off! This is a major problem and you should know about it before you purchase the dvd.
1,"Poor editing, poor story, poor viewer","We decided to buy this movie based on the reviewer blurbs. What a bad decision. The movie rambles, the editing cuts jump back and forth and sideways in a timespan that is never explained, and there are major loose strings that remain unresolved. The end jumps out of nowhere, leaving the view confused, frustrated and, for the four of us who watched it on a rainy afternoon, mad we'd wasted our time."
4,"A thought provoking, coming of age love story","I have to say I really enjoyed this film. I can't say that I've seen Hollywood films made with such sensitivity and honesty. No matter your sexuality, it is virtually impossible not to be moved by this love story. It displays the kind of love everyone longs for, man or woman. I think the only controversy may be in the second half of the film. I expected an explosive confict to put the main characters at odds (i.e. someone breaks someone's heart by doing something unforgivable in true film making style), but that's not exactly what I got and may not have been in the vision of the director (you'll have to see the film to know what I'm talking 'bout). Nevertheless, it is touching and very well made, including the flashbacks. I recommend it whole heartedly."
1,PLEASE EXPLAIN!!!,"would someone please explain this movie to me. utterly rediculous, and then the movie ends without ever explaining anything that you wonder about through the whole movie!!!theres no way people like this movie other than the fact of some cute gusy running around. GARBAGE!!"
2,Do not expect a love story.,"Warning: It is not worthing If you like love story, forget it. Go for ""Just a question of love"" or ""Latter Days"". And If you're interested in nudity, well, you won't get much. Although you see a very and close shot of Jeremie's (?)juicy toy. However, the film is French. As any good French movie, it has to be strange. It seems the film and characters go nowhere, and by the end, you are sure that they went nowhere. I felt frustrated.You never really know what they are thinking or feeling, but that's okay, sometimes, neither we do. After the disappointment I can say that overall I like it because it makes you think. Both boys have problems concerning their inner feelings and you see neither of them are mature enough to speak out. And we adults can't do that either.But nevertheless, if you like uneasy stories and French movies. That's the one."
2,Flip Flop Plot,"I think the director needs prozac to direct this movie, the whole plot is so mess up, junior high student can write better story than this..what was he thinking. don't waste your money buying this movie"
2,Rent it..,"Rent this film when it is out of the ""New Releases"" section of your neighborhood video rental.Horrible editing. Strives to be obscure but just couldn't do it. Uses a lot of silence with uninteresting visuals.Clever poster though - lured a lot of folks in for sure.Cute men,yes - but still an uninspired movie."
1,I want my money back!!!,"...To tell you the truth I hated this movie, poor light, not good acting, it did't have a good script. My friends and I didn't like it. We were expecting a lot from this movie and we were very dissapointed. If I wasn't that dissapointed I wouldn't be writting this. I just don't want more dissapointed people in the world. It is enough wit me!"
3,Artsy and interesting but ultimately unsatisfying,"You know, those French always did have a way with movies. No wonder they love Jerry Lewis so much. Not to dis Jerry at all, but I've always found the French taste in movies, well, a bit off center for me.I liked the film. It takes chances and has some successes. But then again, French directors seem to enjoy leaving a lot of questions. Personally, I think it would be more satisfying to answer the questions rather than leave them just hanging almost oppressively. Maybe the director likes that. Maybe the point is to have these huge clouds hanging over my response. As you can tell, I'm still somewhat conflicted about what I'm supposed to make of it all.So, in an effort to force the issue, I come away with this: its interesting to watch the characters but I feel more manipulated by a rather tried and true art film technique. And I don't like to feel manipulated. So, while I enjoyed watching the movie (DVD actually), I can't say I was satisfied with it."
2,Keep your fast forward button handy.,"I suppose the director could have developed the characters and told a story, but then he wouldn't have had time for endless shots of people staring into space and walking around."
4,Gloriously understated,"I found Come Undone a pleasure to watch. I could identify with Mathieu in so many ways. Coming to terms with ones identity is a puzzling process. The film was erotic, but also subtle, an art only European film makers have an eye for."
4,A good french film,"This film is an honest portrayal of two young lovers whose burgeoning romance becomes strained and eventually fails as Mathieu, the story's focus, deals with both his mother, who suffers from depression, and his suspicious and bitter sister. Told in flashbacks the story reveals the path of the two young men in spotty detail, leaving many things unanswered, allowing you, the viewer to fill in details of the events that occur. I've liked Stephane Rideau since I first saw him in ""Wild Reeds"" and I think he is equally as compelling in this film. Jeremie Elkaim is very good as well and I hope to see him in future films. I think this is a dvd worth owning."
4,Had to watch it twice but it was so worth it!,"This is a tough movie to watch - no doubt. But there is something about it that grabs you and, at the end, you are left with many questions that the filmmakers do not answer. The answers are left up to the viewer.I watched it twice to see if I could find the answers but had to be satisfied that the information not provided by the movie is not relevant to the story. It just doesn't matter what happened to the boys. The story stays the same...I loved the cat!I would recommend this movie. It is a gay movie and it has to be because I don't think this story would have unfolded the same with straight characters - Different pressures and all. Maybe I am wrong.Visually beautiful with excellent use of silence and subtlety!A great film. I want to watch it again."
3,"Very Well Done, Unusual","This was certainly different. Although I have to say I am very used to European filmmaking. Both lead actors were excellent and the cinematography added a lot to the overall quality. To watch these characters grow and find each other was amazing. Although some of the ways they are kept apart seemed a little farfetched. I watched the extras on the DVD and Jeremie says that he sees the story as not being real, but existing in the reader's/viewer's head. I enjoyed the parents who actually were pretty much accepting of their children, always wondering if Mathieu is with Cedric."
3,Worth a rental,"OK, I'll be crass: if I have to sit through an illogical and incomprehensive film in order to see Stéphane Rideau naked, fine. I've had the hots for him since ""Wild Reeds."" Unfortunately, his nude scene in ""Come Undone"" is at night, so you can't see things as well as you might like. As far as the story line goes, I agree with the other reviewers: there's too much bouncing back and forth; it's impossible to follow this incoherent film. But when the two leads are together, there's real chemistry -- especially when they're making love. How often can you say that about leading actors in a relatively mainstream gay film?"
4,End of Summer,"First love, loss and healing surround a boy's discovery of his unique identity outside familial quandaries and limitations. Elkam's performance as Mathieu is astoundingly heartfelt and articulate in portraying this young man's emergence from sheltered apathy into life's passion and unpredictable temperament.Unlike other movies of this genre, the controversy surrounding the boys' orientation and relationship serve to add a compelling depth to the plot, rather than a cliché anecdote.With the mood shifting throughout as the viewer becomes more aquainted with the boys' feelings toward one another, one also can sense the resistance among the other characters to this level of intimacy between young men. The actors deliver such genuine connection between these characters, the innocence of such a love is self-evident.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."
2,Explicite Sex a plus - Everything Else was huge flop,"In short - this movie was pleasing to the eye with the acting and explicite nudity - but overall the screenplay was terrible, the direction was shotting, the editing was all over the place - and there was too much scenery when there didn't need to be....to much silence killed this film. As well as the jumpy story line."
3,Hmm.. not that great.,"Despite kudos on the cover and on various gay websites promoting this movie, I couldn't see the big deal. I'm definitely not averse to foreign-language films (films like Cinema Paradiso etc transcend language barriers) but this one definitely loses something in the translation.I'm not quite sure what the plot of the movie was, other than a guy who lives in Paris but goes to the coast to spend the summer with his mother who I assumed was ill but is apparently just depressed after having a miscarriage.The guys in the film are definitely cute, but as with men in general, good looks only keep your attention so long if there is no substance to back it up. I turned the movie off half-way through as I just couldn't understand what was going on and why I should care about it. I finished it a couple days later and was still unsatisfied.Stick to other films like ""Trick"" and ""Big Eden"" if you want good date movies. :)"
2,bbbbbbbbbboooooooooorrrrrrriiiiiiingggggggggggggg!!!!,I liked the general idea of the movie. It was sweet and warm hearted and the actors did a decent job. But it took me three times of watching to stop falling asleep. It moves kinda slow and kinda reminds me of book on tape...
2,so so,the acting was a D.The sex scenes did nothing for me.No chemistry between the actors.Nonetheless the movie had a bitter truth to it that is why a gave it a 2 stars.
1,Really weird and scares my 2 yo,"I wanted to get my 2y/o something that would have phonics and be fun; loves Sesame Street. This show was annoying , boring and had a few strange scenes with characters that actually scared my son. I just tossed it."
5,"Works well, happy with it","Replaced the fuel pump on my 96 Cherokee with this maybe 6 months ago. It works and from what I priced it out at NAPA and other auto stores it was a great price. I did it myself with help from a friend with a car lift and it saved me a solid amount of money, that said if I hadn't had access to a car lift it would have been a lot more difficult. But yeah Bosch seems to be the brand you want to go with, not airtex(sp?) from autozone or something"
3,Working good,Pump was a little difficult to get the rubber pieces back on the fuel pickup. Still not sure if it works yet. So I'm gonna give it a 3 star. Price was a definite good buy. My ECU burned up along with the pump going out. Had a short in the wiring. I repaired the wire and replaced the pump. Still waiting on the new ECU
4,Great book if somewhat anglo-centric,This is a good overview of naval warfare in WW1. Despite its age I would say it is one of the best and most readable books on the subject. The drawback is that it concentrates almost exclusively on Anglo - German battles.
3,"Informative, but heavy reading.","While enjoying reading about naval battles, this book - while descriptive - gives a little too much detail, turning it into more of a textbook, which for me made it a little tough to really get into the book.Despite this, it is informative and for those of you interested in finding out more about World War One naval battles, it is worth acquiring."
2,Some problems with design,"The buttons are hard to use on the sides of the phone with the case. Using a utility knife to cut out holes for the buttons would greatly improve the product, but it should come this way."
3,Um,It's a decent case. As someone else posted I too thought it would have the power and volume buttons showing but it is covered. The picture is definitely not the same cover. Fits good but the back shows fingerprints which I didn't like. I've bought about 6 cases and this one will be in my drawer with the others. I recommend you guys to check out the earlybirdsavings white tpu gel case cover. It's only like 29 cents plus 2 dollar shipping and it's better then the 10 dollar cases I've bought from here
1,don't buy!,The photo fo the case is misleading. The case they sent is totally different from the one in the photo.
3,Cute bird bath,I really like this bird bath. I received mines in yellow. Unfortunately my parakeets ignored it the whole time. I finally had to take it out cause it got soiled with droppings. Would have like if it had an attachment so it could hand off the side of the cage and not on the floor of the cage.
3,bird bath,cute little item but my birds wont use it - dont know why but it just sits there in the cage and they wont have anything to do with it.
4,Bird's bath,"This is a pretty item, but for my bird is too small,look strong, and well made, but my bird prefer other items."
2,Goes bad,"Within a few months of starting the product, which works great, it started to smell and soon turned rancid. I mean, how does a cleanser go bad? Seems it contains milk products. Nowhere can you find info on using within a certain time frame or keeping refrigerated."
5,Only product in the word that works for me.,"Bought it first on a cruise. Thought dude was trying to sell me crap but it helped my skin dramatically. Yet I change my eating habits, no pork, lessened fried food and beer cause what you put in your body matters also."
5,I love the product!,"My husband and I first used this product while we were cruising. We were so impressed, we have continued to use it. The product is very concentrated, so it actually lasts about 4 months for the two of us, making the costs comparable if not better than most store brands! The service was also prompt!"
1,Noisy,"I don't know why but this device is noisy, it has a distinct buzz. I've tried two of these hubs and the first one was louder than a mosquito when plugged into my Powerbook, and the second is quieter, but buzzes all the time when powered up. I haven't seen how well it performs, as no matter how well it works I won't keep something on my desk which is buzzing at me.So, my advice is to look elsewhere."
1,Noisy and Not much response,"I read the other review about the noise, after I bought it, and experienced the same, high-pitched noise. I asked about it, and this is what iogear's tech support said: ""This is an idiosyncrasy of the device - we are looking into it."" I'll try to return it to the retail store from which I bought it, today."
2,annoys the dogs,"For a FireWire hub, the functionality of this unit is fine. The ports are placed logically, and make it easy enough to get cables attached to it. The biggest drawback, and it's one that is making me thinking about returning the product, is a very noticeable high-pitched whine it emits whenever cables are attached. I thought at first that I would get used to it, but this is annoying, and growing more so each day. If I were ten years younger and had more of the upper register of my hearing, it would be twice as bad. What engineer thought that this noise was acceptable? Perhaps one whose upper register hearing was already completely gone."
1,Noise is unbearble,"I am taking mine back. The noise was horrible. Support said, ""try another cable.""As soon as i plug into the firewire port on the computer it is really loud.Avoid this product at all costs!"
5,20 years too late,"A great read that I wished I had 20 years ago. Simply-stated powerful lessons that teach the basics of money management to acquire wealth. Of course there will be critics, stating it's over-simplified, etc. However, the fundamentals are there, and most people aren't even aware of those. The book succeeds in its mission of providing the reader with all the important concepts of wealth building. I recommend this book and it will only take a couple of hours to read. If you are at mid-life, have no wealth (see that home-equity evaporating, do you?) and up to your eyeballs in debt, this book will undoubtedly change what you do with your paycheck forever. Even someone that makes $25,000/yr. can be wealthy. The secret is know-how, and this book lays it out."
5,Nice Shocks for My Jeep,"Copy and paste of my other review as these are sold as front and rear sets.I have a jeep that had the Upcountry Shocks installed back when it was new. These are equivalent to the HD Rancho type of shocks. I was worried that these shocks would make the truck a bit floaty (which was why I ditched the stock shocks back when I got the vehicle). However, these have excellent control and ride quality. The ride is a bit softer than the Up Country shock package, but firmer than a stock shock would be. Overall an excellent replacement shock."
