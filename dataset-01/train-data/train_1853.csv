2,Dismal New Day,"I don't like Season three at all. However, this review won't be submitted until I have typed the madatory amount of words. There it is. I'm in!"
3,the good wife episode,"I'm getting tired of this show, Don't know if I'll watch the upcoming season. If I don't have anything else to say, then why do I have to add more words? Maybe next time I'll rent or buy my videos elsewhere. Is that enough words for you?????"
5,The Good Wife: The Third Season,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. I could hardly wait to view the ""Third Season"" and it met all my expectations to the point where I have viewed some of the parts a second time. Each series gets better. SDavis"
5,Great for catching up,"CBS was supposed to show last season's finale of The Good Wife the week before the start of the new season, but it was bumped by a football game. I went to Amazon and viewed the episode before the new season began so I would be up-to-date. It was quick and easy and I trust the site."
5,The Good Wife: The Third Season - Best Yet!,I am a big fan of The Good Wife and must say that I was very impressed with the 3rd season. I really like owning the seasons as they come out - this one is my favorite - great design and special features.
5,Good episode,"Again, I would prefer this to be available as a Prime member, but I wanted to keep up on the story so I bought it for my Fire. As always a good addition to the series."
5,Exactly Like I Expected,"A lot takes place in this episode but nothing clicks as strongly as the emergence of Will Gardener as less desirable than Peter Florek as husband material. I felt he was absolutely worm like in this episode. When this series began I think everyone saw this show going in the direction of Alicia ending up with Will. I would be very surprised if anyone wants it to go in that direction now.Michael J. Fox makes his reappearance in this episode. This is one of the best parts on the show so I am always eager for his arrival with the many contradictions in his character. He is full of those tonight.The daughter has a serious problem emerging with her attraction to the extreme religious right. Both of her parents need to become a lot more vigilant and supervisory with her. Much as I don't like Jackie the grandmother, maybe Grace would be better off with her. Her grandmother realizes how much danger she is in and presumably would head her off at the pass."
3,Not so bold.,"The Watercolor Colored Pencils work okay, but the description says Bold colors. My daughter complained that they are actually kind of dull when used as watercolors."
2,Cheap dust boots,"I got a set of these to replace my stock sway bar end links when they wore out and started rattling. These only lasted about 30k miles before the dust boots were badly cracked and one had fallen off. The fact that they are greasable is kind of useless if the dust boots wear out so quickly. Once the dust boots are dead, the end links quickly deteriorate and the rattling returned. Doesn't seem like it would be such an issue if they just made the dust boot a little thicker. It's pretty thin."
4,Gloomier But Beautiful,"Canadian AOR master's third album in 1995 shows their modern rock approach. It became a bit gloomier than ""Mood Swings"" unmistakable AOR masterpiece in 1993. So much so but it is excellently done as you can find in ""Breathing Sand"",""Blue"". If you like modern alternative rock such as REM, Lifehouse and Goo Goo Dolls this album may be a good starting point. If you are a classic 80's hits appreciator, I strongly recommend their 1st, 2nd(Mood Swings) or the latest""Weight Of The World""."
4,quality through and through,"Harem Scarem's third album is a big departure from the straight-forward melodic rock of their first two releases, though it is a very good album in its own right. The trademark harmonies and crunching guitars remain in place, but the songs and lyrics have a darker, more alternative feel. ""Breathing Sand"" is the closest they come to their classic ""Mood Swings"" sound. This album takes repeated listenings to fully appreciate its many merits, though from the first listen there is no questioning the musicianship or the top-notch production."
4,"Surprisingly Versatile and Fun, Overlooked Gem","This is the last album that received any noticable degree of support (I remember it being advertised on weekday morning network television during the time I suffered a death in the family), and, when it disappointed his label, Denver faded away almost as fast and thoroughly as another early & mid 70s hitmaker, Gordon Lightfoot.""Berkeley Woman"" has a surprising edge to it, sounds great even today, very untypical Denver fare. ""The Garden Song"" was much more in tune with the Capricorn Denver's tree-hugger style and a very nice song. Even the songs I did not like here seemed to stretch Denver's mostly self-inflicted artistic boundaries."
4,JD in his rock-and-roll days!,This CD contains a couple of rock-and roll tunes as well as some beautifully written love songs that only JD was capable of writing!
2,Even the best have an off day,"As a brilliant singer/songwriter, John Denver still managed to come up with a couple of turkeys during his career and this for me is one of them. At the time he exchanged his traditional acoustic sound for electric guitar which unfortunately led him to believe that he could sing rock & roll, a style to which his voice wasn't particularly suited. Nevertheless there are a couple of pearls on this album, namely WHATS ON YOUR MIND and THE GARDEN SONG. As a ""bonus""(? ) you are also treated to part of John's early album WHOSE GARDEN WAS THIS which must be THE worst that he did. I don't know of a single track from this collection that has ever resurfaced on a compliation. An acquired taste all round."
1,It blows big time.,"Very simple. Jackie ""The Jokeman""? More like jackie ""The Drunk Man"". He should be flogged."
1,Give me a break.,"I browsed through ""Joke Man's"" book, and found nothing but silly back-of-the-bus drivel. There is nothing offensive or disgusting about this book. The whole thing is just sad."
1,Awful,"This was the worst book I've ever read. Jackie should be fired. It's a good thing they don't allow us to give zero stars!Signed, Robin Quivers"
2,F Jackie!!!,"Yeah, these are mostly ones EVERYONE has heard. And they are funnier when you can hear 'em spoken by Jackie....go catch this guy at the clubs, a book doesn't do the man justice."
4,awesome scientific review,I love this book. the author is astounding in his scientific research dealing with accounts in the Bible to his interpretation and dissection of an account of which he is a professional.
1,What a load of bunk,His analysis of what is described in Ezekiel is ridiculous.He says he started out trying to refute Von Daniken and in course of his analysis became convinced that Ezekiel describes an encounter with extraterrestrial spacecraft and aliens. I think he realized that he could sell more copies of a book that seemed to confirm Von Daniken.
3,good intro into all things jeffersonian,"yet another broad look at jefferson, from political career, near-romantic encounters, family life, friends & correspondences. the writing is crystal clear & fast-paced. you get a snippet of tj's sharp epistolary hand. no huge controversies being discussed here altho i think there were some defenses made for the slavery issue. pick up this book. it's one of the better ones for introducing yourself to tj. good b&w photos of his favorite haunts & some skeletons in the closet."
3,A good recording that wears well,"I've been listening to this record since the initial release, and find it consistently satisfying. The mock-power rock line-up is more than just a gimmick, it's a refreshing sound for jazz, and though little of this music actually swings - the beats are very straight, some rock, some reggae, etc. - it is most definitely jazz in conception.The run of the first three tunes is quite astonishing and shows tremendous promise which the rest of the album doesn't deliver on, although it's still very solid. There is a sense of self-consciousness about the compositions and arranging, and Johnson conveys a seriousness throughout that could have been leavened with a touch of humor or joyous enthusiasm - this is especially true in the folk arrangement, but the imaginative choice of material and the original sound are a definite plus. A solid record."
5,One of my all-time favorite jazz CD's,"This is one of the better examples of jazz fusion to come out of the otherwise dead period of the 80's. Marc Johnson's songwriting, bass playing, and supporting cast blend to create a cohesive and melodic jam session of world music rhythems.So many cultures are sampled in these compostions, Folk, Country and Western, Japanese, Blues, Funk, Indian, Reggae,classical...you name it and it is represented somewhere on this disk. My personal fav is ""Mojo Highway"". A half funk/half reggae opus featuring many of Peter Erskines subtle and not so subtle drum riffs. It also features the best (of the many available) versions of John Scofield's blues classic ""Thanks Again"".As typical on the ECM label the recording quality is stunning...particularly the bass response. You wanna test out your subwoofer and annoy your neighbors? Pop in this disk and let the bad neighbor relations commence."
5,Excellent!,"This soundtrack was no disappointment. I loved every track and I enjoyed the soundtrack a little more than the movie! If you like instrumental soundtracks, you need to have this one in your cd player."
4,It's a hit in our family,"Well...it's a tetherball. The one I bought didn't have any poles. It inflated decently, it looks and acts like a tetherball should. My kids love playing tetherball, and this one certainly fills the bill. It helped that it was on sale when I bought it. They're surprisingly hard to find, even in sports stores around here, so I'm glad Amazon was there for my (2nd) t-ball purchase.The company sent it VERY quickly, which was a surprise as I've bought stuff from Amazon previously before the holidays, and the items took forever to arrive (mid February). This one I expected to arrive in January- but it came with plenty of time to spare for Christmas. Thank you for that!!"
3,A little too simple for 8 year olds,"After digging intermittently for an afternoon, my eight-year-old son needed some help putting the 12 pieces of plastic together. He considers the experience underwhelming, but it is worth noting that he did spend enough time to finish digging without much urging. Kids between 4 and 6 may enjoy this kit better."
1,What a piece of junk,"Save some time and some money and do not buy this. What a piece of junk. Let's start with the clay that the dino is in. It will get all over you. Then the ""chisel"" will break apart in your hands. To get a good head start, run the item under hot water. It will get rid of the clay dust and make the mold more pliable. Then when you are completely frustrated after finally getting the darn dino out, be prepared to line up tiny holes to put it together."
4,It was fun,This was fun. It did take some work to excavate the bones. Truly probably something that we should have done over many days rather than try to make it an activity. Also the dust got all over the house.
1,shoecrazy,"O M G ! i don't even know if it works. i couldn't get beyond the taste. it's awful tasting, i'm just saying."
1,Really BAD product - not sure it even contains DGL!,I have purchased NOW and Enzymatic Therapy DGL from amazon and amazon marketplace sellers in the past. Both of those brands work very well. Tried this brand recently and my wife and I both agree that it simply does not work. It does not smell at ALL like licorice when you open the bottle and tastes like chalk. I would highly recommend buying another brand - we had to throw most of the bottle out.
3,Not exactly...,"Not exactly what I wanted. I had tried Dgl tablets before; these are just not the same. Guess I'll have to go back to Edgewater to get the ""real"" ones; the ""Brothers"" over there know their products and will find them for me."
1,DGL stands for Does Gag Lots,"I am going to force myself to keep taking it, and I will update again if my opinion changes, but right now, I'd rather have the burning and gasping for air of acid reflux than these disgusting pills. It somehow manages to be oily and powdery at the same time which defies science. I love licorice, but this tastes nothing like. They stay in your teeth 10 minutes after you're done eating them, so you get to continue to experience the flavor--without relief! I've been careful to take them 15 minutes prior to eating, and they aren't working any more than a few Tums would. I was looking for a magic pill and so far, this isn't it. I will keep trying them though."
4,Does help to calm stomach,It is not bad tasting and I am one who does not like licorice. Good supplement for those who take prescriptions for reflux and need something in between regular meds to calm your stomach.
4,Did it work?,"Was curious about these, so I decided to take it to see if it would help out with my gastritis. (which is not severe btw)Didn't really notice a difference. The taste was good though.I'm sure it's a good product, but just didn't work for what I needed."
2,Tastes Horrible!,"I have tried several different brands of DGL Licorice, and this is the worst tasting one of all. Do try another brand, though, as it has helped me with my acid reflux and heartburn. It is much better for your body than acid suppressing drugs."
1,Not worth the cost to me.,Used just a few times; not effective for me; threw away unused product; reverted to prescription Nexium and/or OTC Gaviscon. Careful diet most effective.
4,Very Good Read,"Yes the sex was rauchy, that's why it's called erotica. Don't like explict sex, then don't read. But sex aside, it was a good story. The phoniness of the British Society was so double sided,pompus and foolish that people could be brought to ruin by rumors. So glad those days are over. LOL. The underlying message and what are you willing to risk for love. And glad to know love (couple with great sex) prevailed."
2,My opinion ONLY!,"Lady Abigail Weston was a twenty-five year old spinster and determined to see her younger sister, Caroline, wed well. However, without knowing what happened in the marriage bed (except the horrible things she had been told) Abby could not explain it to Caroline. To rectify this, Abigail hired someone to give her lessons!James Stevens was the illegitimate son of an earl. James thought nothing could ever surprise him again, until Abigail's request for love lessons! Curious and intrigued, he agreed!** I warn everyone up front that this book contains A LOT explicit sex! I can only recommend this book for mature readers! The love scenes go into detail and each is several pages long. Not really much of a plot to this book, except for a past paramour interfering out of jealousy. Caroline seemed, to me, as if she was thrown into the book as an after thought. The book is well written, grammar wise. But, in my opinion, the book came across to me as soft porno instead of romance. **"
4,A New Author For Me I Must Admit To Liking A Lot!,"This was a great love story with so much tension, sensuality, and emotions that I found it hard to put down. This was a well-crafted story with great character development.Abigail wants to learn all that she can about physical love between a man and a woman so she can instruct her sister before her marriage. Abigail seeks out James Stevens a wealthy ... member of London society with quite the reputation as a ladies man. He will be perfect in describing what goes on between couples. What neither of them expects are the feelings that develop between each other or the obstacles that keep them from being together.This was a first time read for me by this author and I found her writing to be very entertaining. I look forward to reading Micheal's (James's brother) story next."
2,"AWEFUL TO LEARN, USE AND KEEP COOL","I had a Pioneer DVD 5-Disc home theater system and wanted a receiver to hook this and other A/V stuff(playstation, X-box, DVD, computer) to. I only used it with the DVD/CD player. It has all the right hook ups. The problem is this thing always overheats. After 30 minutes of use it goes into stand-by. The controls are hard to figure out to get sound to all 5 speakers and the Sub-woofer. It feels solid but can't keep itself cool there is no cooling fan in the system just wide vents that if you look through you see the big heat sink. The cabinet will still get warm to the touch and shuts down though."
1,oh please...don't buy this product!!!!,I took my 12 year old daughter and her friend to Adventure Island yesterday and bought a bottle of this there....within a few minutes all three of our faces were burning!! (it did not affect our bodies that way..just our faces) it was awful. After about 20 minutes of discomfort we went to first aid and washed with soap and water...then got our money back....all i could think about is that this product can also be used for babies 6 months old and up....i have a 2 year old and i am so glad she was not with us yesterday...it was awful!!
5,Wonderful Biography,"I just finished this excellent biography this afternoon. After reading Stone's Lust for Life, I was curious to read a regular biography about Van Gogh. This is not exactly a ""regular"" biography, but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless. Meier-Graefe blurs the line between historical fiction and biographical nonfiction. The result is really fantastic. I felt like I got a sense of Van Gogh's tortured soul, his complex relationships (with his brother, with Gauguin..), and how it all worked together to create his art."
5,"Marcasite ring, simply lovely.","Great ring, quick delivery. Happy with purchase. Lovely design and happy to have it in amethyst purple, my favorite! Marcasite is a unique style and I'm glad its making a comeback into fashion world."
1,loser,"the stone fell out one day after owning this ring,it is very beautiful and i would have it set again, this time much better than was shipped,but i cannot find the stone.oh i guess i won't be shopping here anymore"
3,"Pretty,but shoddy workmanship....","A good price for a pretty ring...but if you are intending for a ""daily wearing"" kind of ring, you may want to look further.The marcasite stones began to fall out after the first few months of wear....."
4,4 star review,I loved the elegant design and it was just as ordered when I received it. The only thing I would have wished were different was a larger stone-and wouldn't have minded paying extra for that. I really liked the unique design. I love the jewelry selections at Amazon.com.
1,Not happy,"You get what you pay for here. I think it is prettier on the computer than in person. My son's girlfriend wore it two days and it started tarnishing. She was so happy with it when he first gave it to her, so I hate that it is not holding up."
4,This is a pretty one,"The medal is shiny and the stone is pretty and clear. It is a little bit darker than the picture shown, but not drastically. I like it a lot, it is lovely and the band isn't so wide its uncomfortable, its a nice snug fit. Thank you for this nice piece of Jewelry, I love rings and love collecting them"
5,love this,i dont think it smells all that great when its in the bag but once on it smells and tastes great! works for all body parts this is deff a fun part of the bed room and goofying/playing around!!
3,Decent,"Tasted pretty good, but don't get too much in your mouth - it's not great in large qualities haha. Worked as a good lubricant too."
4,Great,"I bought this for my honeymoon. I thought it had a little bit of a chalky taste to it, but not too bad given that it is a powder. My husband loved it! I would definitely recomment this product. It smells great!"
1,Awful!,"While the feather tickler is a lot of fun, and the tin is nice, the actual powder is awful. It tastes like chemicals, and the scent is more perfume than sweet honeysuckle. It's not a pleasant flavor at all!"
2,not what i expected,"it's like trying to lick flavored baby powder or something similar, it definately has that dry powder taste to it, and you taste more of the powder than the flavor, dissapointed"
3,Honeydust,It tastes good and is light to go on...don't think it massages well into the skin...and its kinda dusty...But its not bad either...good taste and smell...but not a substitute for good massage oil/lotion.
5,Kama Sutra Kissable Honey Dust,"This is an awesome body dust which leaves your skin soft, light fragrance and deliciously lickable. I recommend this product to everyone."
4,Krinos Tahini,This was a very good puchase. The shipper was very fast and very friendly. The Tahini was very fresh and of good quality. I will order again.
5,Best. Tahini. Ever!,"I LOVE this brand of tahini. I go out of my way to purchase it locally, but after seeing the price through Amazon, I'm going to order it in bulk!I used to think all tahini was bitter and dry, but the Krinos brand proved me wrong. I can eat this with a spoon! But, typically, I use it to make a delicious salad dressing by missing 2 TBSP tahini with 1 TBSP tamari and 1 TBSP apple cider vinegar and a splash of water. Soooo good!"
2,Bitter,"Very bitter and not nearly as thick as expected. Very runny, actually. There are better brands out there."
1,Warning: may contain arsenic,"I used to eat a lot of Tinkyada pasta until I read that rice grown in the US South may contain high levels of arsenic. According to Tinkyada, their rice is grown in Arkansas. I emailed them to find out if they had tested their rice for arsenic. I never received a reply. Their website does not address the issue either. Until they print assurances that their rice is safe, I plan to avoid all their products.Lundberg rice, which is grown in California, is safe from arsenic according to the company."
4,Are we already in inflation?,"Love the product, but the price is now over $41.00??? I purchased this for $33.63 in February! What's going on Tinkyada?"
1,Disappointing,"I have read and enjoyed many books by Ms. Hutchinson but was very disappointed in this one. I could not feel any sympathy or interest in the characters, especially the heroine. She seemed hard and thoughtless. The personalities seemed forced into character. I think the author was trying too hard for humorous dialogue that came across too sarcastic and overdone. The plot could have been amusing but became tiresome."
1,crashed registry,"I bought SummitSoft Psoftware at Best Buy and it scrambled the registry on my Dell PC. I lost the contents of the hard drive.I restored the operating system and just out of curiosity reloaded Office and then your software and it again crashed the system and destroyed the registry.I returned the software to Best Buy and got my money back. I told them the software not only didn't work, but was demonic."
1,PowerSlides didn't work with PowerPoint 2007,"I got PowerSlides to work with PowerPoint 2003, but when I upgraded to PowerPoint 2007, it doesn't work. Though PowerPoint says it has a problem with the macros, even when I set the security settings to allow all macros, it still doesn't work. The website for PowerSlides is most unhelpful in this regard.If it doesn't work with the latest version of PowerPoint, I'm not sure what the point of this product is..."
2,install problem,I tried to install the product but it failed to connect to the internet to register before it could be used even though my connection was working fine so uninstalled it and returned it.
5,Outstanding.,"The layout and content of this book is truly outstanding. Cabral's lucid explanations and balance of theory and examples, make this book a pleasure to read. The text also provides a much needed framework for thinking about the ambiguous term, ""strategy."" Several of the author's reviewers comment that this text is destined to become the definitive introductory text on the industrial organization and I support that view."
3,Found it good but short..,It could satisfy you if you want to have an idea of IO. I recomend to jump straight to a higher level book.
1,made shoes not fit,The inserts didn't work because it made my foot much higher and my shoes didn't fit anymore
2,Not high enough to support my arch,"I wear boots a lot, and they are notorious for poor support. I had high hopes that this partial insole would help my aching feet, but there just isn't enough support in the arch. And no support for the transverse arch at all. The one that works best for me is the New Balance Ultra High Arch insole. It is a full length insole which is its only problem. It only fits in my really big boots!"
1,Ladies - unless you wear work boots. . .,"Ladies, these supports are so wide they will not fit in my Bass loafers. I wear an 8B. It's not like I was trying to fit them into a pair of heels. I returned them."
2,Worthless as a support,Fits nicely and protects the foot from blisters but is worthless as a support for fallen arches. It is soft and compliant and provides little support as it contours to your fallen feet rather than supporting them.
4,Plant and bird feeder hanger,This hanger is sturdy and is indexed so that it can point in three different directions. I modified the pair I ordered so I can point them anyway I want to. You can view a photo I submitted in the user submitted photos (I painted my pair green).
1,If you already own this....,"...then you have my sympathies.I own this set, but found out today that Fox are going to be re-releasing another Alien box set with each film getting the 2-disc super duper ultimate edition treatment.If you haven't got this set then wait until the middle of the year for the new 9 disc boxed set."
3,"Buy Alien and Aliens as singles, leave this set alone!","I love this series and the first two DVD's Alien and Aliens are chock full of extras; commentary, behind the scenes, still photos, deleted scenes, outtakes and interviews. But when you get to Alien3 and Alien Ressurection, you're left with maybe an interview and possibly some commentary. Don't waste your money buying this DVD set. If you buy the first two separately, you'll be glad you did because you'll save yourself about 50 bucks by avoiding the boxed set. The first two have plenty of extras to keep you busy for awhile. The last two have a little while to develop a stronger reputation to put out more extras for those projects. I do also need to warn that when this boxed set went on sale the first time it was literally a fraction of the cost that it is now. Don't waste your money. Buy the first two on DVD and if you really have to have the last two in the series, buy em on VHS since you're not really getting a lot of extras with the DVD's."
5,"absolutely magnificent, rollercoaster ride of terror........","the best dvds i own to date! the care and work that went into it, from the packaging, to the incredible thx digital audio and video transfers are truly awesome, as are the films themselves! i had an 8 and 1/2 hour marathon yesterday and i can only say 'wow'! aliens as well as alien resurrection really stand out for me, but viewing the four films together is one heck of an experience. make the investment-you will not be sorry; this set will sell millions of copies! YOU MUST GET IT AS A SHOWPIECE FOR YOUR DVD SYSTEM AS WELL AS YOUR HOME AUDIO SYSTEM, then sit back and enjoy this awesome roller coaster ride of terror and suspense. absolutely incredible."
5,Another nice collection.,"This is another wonderful collection of DVD's. They have added many deleted scenes to these movies which makes a few things a little clearer about what was happening in the movie. Some of the scenes are actually pretty cool. There are tons of extras in regards to interviews and behind the scenes stuff to keep your attention for hours. If you are a fan of the Slien series, then don't miss out on this wonderful collection."
4,ALIEN LEGACY!,"I think I understand what is going on with this five-DVD boxed set! The hope is that if you really liked half of the four Alien movies--""Alien,"" ""Aliens,"" ""Alien 3"" and ""Alien Resurrection""--the documentary about the 20th anniversary release of the first film will be enough to tip the scale and make you buy this whole set! That does not work for me, but it might work for you!"
5,Top-Notch DVD's get less-than-stellar treatment,"Well, the first two films, at least, get genuine collector treatment (like their out-of-print laserdisc siblings). However, nothing terrific has been done to ALIEN 3 outside of the best transfer to date in terms of audio quality. I mean, no director's edit and no extras except a self-serving quicky featurette. What? Where were the behind the scenes tension with the crew and studio? Where are the drawings and special effects segements? Most of all: The feature is not presented in the full WIDESCREEN format!!!! The opening titles are cut off at the sides for goodness sakes!!!!! And this is so-called THX mastering!!!! I love this film as much as the others and it's disappointing more wasn't done with it. I've seen the director's rough cut of ALIEN 3 and it is quite a great film! Why not for the DVD, as well? As for ALIEN:RESURRECTION, it is, by far the best looking DVD's of the lot (it's the newest of course). Oh well, my 2 cents."
2,Fox's attempt to make us buy two films we don't want.,"I'm not going into detail about what I thought about each of the four films, this review is regarding the boxed set. The packaged set contains two really good films, Alien and Aliens, and two not so good films, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection. You'd be better off buying a copy of the first two films individually."
3,Let Me Save You Some Money....,"you only need the first 2 movies of this series, really! ""Aliens""(the sequel) is an awesome, nail biting piece of sci-fi, then comes ""Alien""(the original) in a close 2nd. But 3 and especially 4 blows big chunks.The producers should have stopped with ""Aliens"", there's only so many times one can milk a cow, ya know?"
5,"Definately a must-buy, BUT .....","This package definately is a must-buy. However I do have some comments.The subtitling on these DVD's is awful, it is made for deaf people, so every sound is transcribed, and every sentence is preceded by the name of the person speaking, which is really annoying.Also I have to say that the transfer quality of Aliens is the worst of the 4 disks. It is actually quite grainy, which I think is an utter shame."
5,ALIENS by James Cameron is no. 1,"I am looking forward to this 5 disc dvd set. Anamorphic format for all of them, well done 20th century fox.ALIENS (the ""best"" sequel ever made, along with T2)Buy it I has ofcourse already ordered my copy."
4,Why four?,"Alien - must have Aliens? Restored? YES! -Must must have. Alien 3- I liked it. I enjoyed how 1,2,3 were all so different. -must haveRessurection? No thanks... here's hoping I can buy the above three seperately."
1,Alien (the first DVD) will not play on my Panasonic player,"I was very disappointed when I tried to play Alien, because my home entertainment system (which I bought Christmas 2001 - Panasonic - SCHT-290) could not recognize or play this disk. The other three work fine.I went to the internet and did a google search on ""Alien DVD"" in the ""Group"" section of google, and found hundreds of similiar complaints. Sadly, the Fox Alien DVD website does not seem to be aware, nor offer any recourse to those effected customers.Fox should offer to allow returns, or replacements with a unversally compatable DVD matching the Legacy Edition format and features."
5,How to do the same thing 4 different ways.,"I love the Alien series, good and bad parts all together.Alien the Horror: Best of the series (I like basic horrors) and was original. Many imitators, no successors.Aliens the Action Movie: Guns 'n' Ammo in outer-space. Best ships, weapons and story of the series.Alien 3 the Art Movie: The cute kid and the hero die before the credits are over, powerful imagery, (loved the hint that something wasn't right with Ripley, alien hatching, burn the bodies scene) and a new aspect to the alien life cycle. Many didn't get the point. This is the thinking fans movie.Alien Resurection the comedy: Felt sorry for the poor alien at the end, finaly a human face to empathise with the alien, just wants his momma, and she flushes him out the airlock again. Nice! Still weaker than the first 3 combined, but interesting anyhow."
1,movie has scenes removed,"The dvd set Alien Legacy has scenes removed that impact the continuity of the movie and character development.I watched the first part and noticed so many missing scenes that I couldn't stand it. I felt ripped off by Fox home Video.The scenes cut are:The rest of the crew waking up (besides Kane)The attack of the alien from its egg, where it enters Kanes bodyThe retrieval of Kane from the hole in the alien shipThe walk back with KaneThe lengthy argument about quarrantineI shut off the movie at this point. If you want to find out more about the original plot lines look up ""Ridley Scott"" go to a site that links scripts of his movies and look at the scene progression versus what you see."
5,There could never be a better series of space horror movies,"All four films (but especially the first two) are all amazing in their own right. You have the acting, the effects, the score, the plot, everything is incredible! The fourth installment, I admit, was reaching, but nevertheless worth your time and money. This is for any sci-fi/horror fan that's up for a good time."
4,Mediocre box set,Decent value yet there is a lack of creativity with the inserts.Go for alien anthology on blu ray due to it's plethora of extra content that will make you appreciative of the creation of these movies.
3,It was okay,"I think it was really awful that Abby got her ears pierced without her parent's permission,and didn't even feel sorry about it. And she should've told her parents about Victoria. But it was an okay book. I do not recommend it,though. Sorry."
5,You might want some chocolate handy while you read this,Full of love and compassion and forgiveness this book is hard to put down until you've read the whole thing. How to transform a troubled child into a happier member of a family is just one way in which this book shines. I enjoy this author's writing.
4,Beauty is on the inside!!!,"What a beautiful story about love, healing, and forgiveness! The fact that it deals with post-breast cancer makes this story twice as grand! Jenni had been cancer free for five years, yet the pain was as raw and as real as ever. Never did she ever think she'd find a man who would be willing to love her knowing what the cancer had done to her!But when Jenni's nephew, Cory, caused Todd to walk into their lives she would soon discover that not all men looked on the outside of a person. No matter how scarred or flawed we think we are, true love looks on the inside!This is one of my favorites of the entire Loving series (I also thought the first book in this series was great). I like how the author develops romance and outward expressions of that love throughout the book instead of waiting until the last chapter; and Todd was a sweetheart!"
1,NIGHTMARE MACHINE,I WISH I HAD NEVER BOUGHT THIS RADIO. TO TURN OFF THE ALARM YOU HAVE TO PUSH 2 BUTTONS AT THE SAME TIME. DOING THIS WHEN YOU ARE HALF ASLEEP IS NOT AN EASY TASK AND WE BOTH END UP AWAKE BY THE TIME IT GETS TURNED OFF.
2,Didn't receive,"I was notified by the vendor that the product was not is stock in my size, and would not be again. I don't have anything else I can say except I have another one in a different color, and it faded quicker than I expected, but the fit and look is good."
4,Unruly Hamlet for middle schoolers,"Coville, a veteran writer who notes he has been studying Hamlet for 30 years, makes a coherent narrative from this eternally unruly story, leavening it with direct quotes from Shakespeare's play. Even dialogue, however, is often emended, albeit richly in a modern idiom. Gore wields acrylics and pastels to fine atmospheric effect using a palette of alternating deep blues or burnished browns lightened with white and gold. His figures slip into and out of the foreground like actors on a stage, and the ghost is magnificent. For middle schoolers not quite ready for the real thing, this works."
5,Nice retelling,"I read this book to 7th graders to prepare them for a play called, ""Hamlet Will Rock You."" Thanks to the background from this book, they were able to thoroughly enjoy this updated rock version of the play. Good job, Bruce Coville! A good read aloud or independent read for students not quite ready for The Bard."
2,"Too many listings, not enough technical","This 704 pages book has way too much listings. It does not go deep technically speaking. Topics are pretty interesting but not enough informations on each.In short, I am pretty disapointed. Thick but nothing in there that worth the weight! I will search for another book."
2,Too many water,"I was looking for a book for advanced developers.Unfortunately this one is just for the beginners.There are lot of code examples, but most of them just a slight modification of the code from a previous chapters.Also author spend time describing how to use ASP.Net components, not how to solve real problems."
3,Rating this book intermediate is giving it too much,"Although a good book, most of what is provided is not anything that is going to TEACH a seasoned programmer anything. Most of the code is written in the HTML page with very little code-behind examples. Yes, I know when it works in one, it works in the other, but one of the most important things about ASP.NET and the .NET initiative is the separation of the code from the user interface. Promotes reusability, readability, yadda, yadda, yadda. Some credit must be given to the book however, in that it does cover VERY important topics of ASP.NET and it does give the code in VB.NET and in C#. The code and the samples are very simple though, so be aware that if you're looking to do more than get an overview, you'll miss the mark on this one."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be a real letdown and I regret purchasing this book. Although the book is replete with examples, many of them are simply rehashes of prior examples, with the exception of two or three changed lines of code.If you're looking for in-depth coverage, or even a good introduction to ASP.NET and ADO.Net, you get neither in this book. In fact, the book states that it ""is outside the scope of this book to teach you the basics of programming ASP.Net."" I don't think it would have been too much to expect a small primer on each of the technologies, even if it meant adding an appendix or two. At any rate, your mileage may vary."
4,Provides nice introductory coverage of ASP.NET/ADO.NET,"Want to learn how to leverage ADO.NET to insert, update, delete, and display data in your ASP.NET applications? This book is for you. If you are new to ASP.NET and ADO.NET then you have a lot to learn with the new data display controls and a whole new model as far as data access is concerned. Classic ASP developers looking to quickly learn how to build data driven ASP.NET applications should give this book a read."
3,A lighter guide than expected,This would be a book I would recommend for novice ASP programmers or even new to web programmers. It was written with a bit fluff here and there greatly lacking concision I have come to demand from technical books. It did serve as a good overview book on ASP.Net and ADO.Net techniques but not much deeper than that.
4,Good example code,"Personally, if this book would have come out during the ASP.NET beta it would have been more useful to me. We could have all used more examples than we had back then. If you are trying to get a grasp on how data is moved between the data store and the ASP.NET page, this is a good book. For more seasoned ASP.NET developers, you may still find a example or two that makes you think differently about an approach to solving a problem."
4,Great tempra paint,"This tempra paint is the perfect consistency and truly is washable. And, apparently it doesn't taste too great (which is nice considering my daughter loves to attempt to eat paint)."
5,Great paint--sucky caps if not packaged properly,"Paint is wonderful to use on windows. But Amazon packers let 3 different bottles bounce around in package w/ 2 books also ordered, ending w/ 2 caps breaking, 1 bottle slightly leaking, 1 book slightly damaged, and leaving challenge of tight close on bottles so product doesn't dry out as it is used. Did I send it back? Heck NO. More of a pain than it would be worth. Having to use plastic along w/ what is left of caps to keep them sealed."
1,Disappointed,"... The rhymes were not v. good or catchy for a child, and did not flow. I bought the book for the Chinese translation, but was disappointed with the caligraphy and Chinese in the rhymes. The English translation seem OK, but translations are not really for reading out loud. One star for the good pictures which my daughter liked."
3,Review,"This book contains a lot of unformation concerning the international market and how to function within its barriers. It offeres many cases which help explain the issues and problems concerning the market. Alhough, the book is confusing and is hard to understand the language if you do not have a background in business. The information is inbedded in the text which makes it difficult to find what your looking for, and also offers many points of view which make it difficult to understand what is the correct answer."
1,Where is the book?,"I am using this as a medium to communicate with you cos I do not know any other since i am new to amazon. It's been a while I purchased your book, so where is my book? Please take prompt actions."
1,Say boss can I have mo chitlins and watermelon?,"This is a minstrel show. Period point blank. These guys set black people back 20 years. Look at them in ""black face"" on the cover of their album. They look like al jolsen twins. Then the music they make is insulting to every race color and creed. Any music that makes you feel dumber when you listen to it should be banned. I'm calling my alderman now to start the movement. LOL."
3,cute phone,Cute phone and inexpensive but the phone cord to the wall didnt work. Small cost to replace it but not worth the trouble of returning the phone to get another...
3,great book but not good for learning if you are a visual learner.,"This is a great book for composite materials especially if you really want to know what is going on in the composites industry. Even though the literature is good, the pages are all black and white with very poor print image quality, which does not benefit visual learners. This book could be great if the print quality improved."
2,Upside down and backwards for a 100+ dollar book?,This book is actually bound upside down and backwards which is totally unacceptable for a 100+ dollar book.
2,2003,"It has been opened up before, so you don't know if he has taken cards or not. I suggest to not get it from this buyer."
3,Fun in the garden,"It all starts with the delivery of a box of delicious oranges from Lily's Grandma in California. From there, we spend a year with Lily in her Maine home and watch as she and her garden grow and change month-by-month. The delightful journey also contains a narrative comparison between Lily's Maine garden and Grandma's California growing season (which never ends!). Lily's Garden is beautifully illustrated and has lovely asides providing anecdotal information on the things Lily is doing in and for her garden (a short history of oranges, how to make maple syrup, vegetables in Lily's Garden, Grandma's Blueberry Pancake recipe, etc.). The joys of the seasons and the excitement of gardening are nicely captured in this fun book."
3,eh....,I liked the dvd...it was a bit slow sometimes but the part that really upset me was that he keeps referring to the booklet that comes with the video(this was originally VHS) and NO BOOKLET comes with this dvd so there are lots of recipes for his monster make up concotions that you don't get.
4,"Good condition, pre-highlighted",Book is in good condition with highlighting throughout. I was pleased withthe order.
1,"Watch Out: This Gave Me ""Pine Mouth""","I love the taste of Mrs. May's products, but the Sesame Crunch gave me ""Pine Mouth."" Sesame Crunch is made in China, and contains pine nuts. Chinese pine nuts, as well as certain other pine nuts, can cause you to have a horrible taste in your mouth for up to two weeks after ingestion. Everything you eat tastes bitter or soapy. I've had it for five days now -- blech. No more Sesame Crunch for me."
2,Not popular at my house,This is the first of many Mrs. May's products we've bought and eaten over the past 5 years that everyone in our family disliked. I personally found it too sweet and nobody liked the flavor at all. Very disappointed with this flavor from such a normally tasty line.
5,Yum,"These sesame crunch cubes are delicious. They are like little cubes of crunchy granola without the excess sweetness. Pure sesame seed flavor, not masked by salt and other spices. They're low in sugar and high in fiber, calcium, iron. I can't get enough, and I don't feel guilty eating them. What a treat."
3,"Nice for summer/spring, don't spend full price","Somewhat lightweight (not a very high fill power), tag says minimum 75% down (NOT AS ADVERTISED). 13"" box construction (not baffle box, with walls on all 4 sides to encourage down in the corners too, but better than no box). Microsuede feels nice, but since it's not machine-washable I bought a removable duvet cover. Feather fallout test: after plumping for a few minutes, I saw 2 feathers poking through. Guess that's due to the low thread count. Not too shabby for $40."
4,Wonderful !!!,This is a great comforter. Light in weight but warm as can be. Softer than excepted. I love it.
3,leaking feather,"The feathers would be leaking from the comforter and the pillows. After 1 week of using it, your room will become a feather zoo."
3,The feathers keep coming out!,"It's very warm, good enough! But the feathers keep coming out all the time! If you don't have a vacuum, you have to think about it!"
4,"Puts the ""Comfort"" in Comforter","I love this bed set... the faux suede is so cozy, and it really gives my room a very modern but warm feeling. And I didn't realize the down would keep me so warm! I'm still looking for a bed skirt to match though and I find tiny feathers on it routinely - neither issue however, would keep me from buying it if I had it to do over. :o}"
4,Useful ideas for my classes,"I enjoyed this video, although it is not really easy to follow. The relaxed rhythm tap style is my personal favorite, but this tape is not the most exciting thing to watch. The warm up section is great. I've used a lot of the basic drills. The routines that follow are good, but not amazing. I still haven't had the attention span to really watch and learn all of the breakdowns of the steps. But it did give me some ideas to use in my own classes and I'm sure I'll refer to it later when I'm in search of some new material."
4,Great read for biography lovers or fans of Toulouse-Lautrec,"Excellent and engaging, though it covers a very wide scope. Be forewarned, though...it is the same as ""Explosive Acts"" by the same author...just a different title!"
5,Wide-ranging and fascinating biography,"Written by an art historian, this biography gives enlightening assessments of Lautrec's artistic development, within the context of his family, upbringing, artistic education in Paris, and his fascinating, if increasingly dissipated, life in Montmartre. This is extremely well written, with lively anecdotes and details about Lautrec and all of his significant family and friends. It is the single best book about the artist that I have read. The tone of this biography is just right: clearly admiring, but never uncritical or less than honest about a creative genius whose life spun out of control. This is not just a biography, but a rich experience of the art world and a wide variety of people within the society and culture of late 19th century Paris. I thoroughly loved this book!"
4,Pizza Tiger,If you are in the pizza business or if you are thinking about getting into the pizza business - you must read this book.Easy to read - but a bit slow in parts - the nature of biography in my opinion .. so overall subject matter for me was excellent and I am in the pizza business.On a literary scale the book was only a 2 star - but 5 star for me as I used some of the ideas and confirmed some concepts.Daddio
4,A very sweet book,"This is a very sweet book. This multicultural book welcomes the reader into Ahmed's life through the first person point of view. The illustrations are a wanderful compliment to the words. The reader meets the city in which Ahmed lives, the people who surround him, and his family values which are easily related to children's lives. I read with anticipation wandering what the secret could be. I closed this book with a smile on my face."
4,Excellent Children's Book and reminder for those of us who have lived in Egypt,This book is well written and illustrated and will always be a constant reminder of my days living and working in Egypt. I have gladly shared this book with many of my friends and colleagues and will continue to do so. Proud to add it to my collection of memorabilia of my life in Egypt.
4,Great discussion!,"I really enjoyed sharing this book with my students. We had some great discussions about what it would be like to live in another culture, and the difference between doing ""chores"" to help out, and what it would be like to have to work to help provide money for food for your family at a young age. It was also a great talk about the benefit of education, and how blessed any student is to get an education. The illustrations were amazing too!! It was a fantastic and high interest way to talk about modern day Egypt, instead of always focusing on Ancient Egypt when we talk about that part of the world."
4,For dog lovers,"Cute and clever collection of observances on doggy behavior. Just for fun, but one of the cleverest of its type, and I love the illustrations."
1,Toner,do not buy because this is a replacement cartridge and the last 2 that I purchased the printing came out horrible
5,Very Therapeutic,"I thought this book was wonderful. It definitely helped me to realize that I wasn't alone in my feelings and fears, decades after losing a baby to adoption. I feel it has helped me to face the truths of just how things happened and helped me to realize that it was not only not my decision but it was not my fault. I was given no choice and this book helped me to realize that. It has been very therapeutic in helping me deal with my loss and to understand my behaviors over the years."
5,Adopting Healing,I read this treasure 14 years aftering finding my daughter. It put into words the anxiety I endured the first 21 years of her life that were lost to me. This book should be read by all mothers who felt they were 'forced' to place their child for adoption. It can provide validation for the feelings we were afraid to express. The authors did a superb job of covering all aspects of the pain of the adoption experience that will color our lives forever.
4,A GREAT Resource for Us Moms,"Thank you, Joseph M. Soll and Karen Wilson Buterbaugh! Over 1.5 million of us surrendered babies for adoption in the 50s and 60s and 70s, and it now feels really good to know people are writing about how we can heal from that incredibly painful loss. This book is extremely well done, and Mr. Soll and Ms. Wilson Buterbaugh are to be commended for their courage in taking on this topic. Thanks for illuminating a path that, hopefully, will aid the healing process for many of us.Sharon Shaw Elrod; www.sharsstory.com"
5,Excellent book!!!,"There are very few books about this very sensitive topic. Millions of women in this country have been forced by society to surrender their babies to adoption because they committed the sin of becoming pregnant as single women. It is a travesty and very difficult, if even possible, to recover from this cruel punishment to both mother and child.Joe Soll and Karen Buterbaugh do a great job of not only defining the experience, but provide tools to help Mothers begin the long journey to healing.This book should be mandatory reading for every natural mother who has suffered because of the loss of her child and every adopted person who wants to really understand what happened and why."
2,Wasn' that good,"I can't honestly give it any more than 2 stars. I found it hard to read with all the insets in it, and to 'psychiatric' for me. I do find it ironic thsat the field of social workers is the field who screwed up many adooptions and yet they still hold the positions of releasing information in many cases. There are better books out there."
2,Disappointed,"The preview of this book made no mention that it's focus is on women who placed their children for adoption in the 70's and were coerced into it.I placed my child for adoption in the 90's under no one's influence. It was a painful, yet positive experience.I am in search of a book that can help a person in my situation.This book was not it."
3,"It's no NY, London, Paris, Munich... but....","This is not an easy record, which is what made New York, London, Paris, Munich so genius. M's (Robin Scott's) debut was seemless, beautiful, catchy, silly and fun. This record is more like a b sides and hodge podge collection - not to say that it isn't worth getting. The original version of Eureka and Honolulu Joe are pure M all the way."
3,The Unnamed CD.,"This is another album from Metallica, a band who saw the light in 1981. It is the second E.P since Garage Days from this band and include a new single who shows the same force and the same sound than the previous CD ST Anger. All the rest are songs about 6, played live in Paris, with the new bassist Robert Trujillo. In fact other CD from Metallica, with nothing new except the title song."
4,A Decent Single With Great Live performances,"First of all, If for nothing else, buy this cd for the live songs - they rock. As for ""The Unnamed Feeling"" itself, it's a decent song - Definately better than anything on St. Anger, but still does not live up to their older stuff. Yes, the sound quality is a lot better than that of ""Frantic"" or ""St. Anger"" and Hetfeild obviously put some effort in making the vocals sound good, and i think the guitar intro could actually be considered a riff... But still no solos or complex licks that made Metallica famous, and the style in which the song is written gives of a slight odor of nu metal. I think Metallica is trying to go back to the raw, heavy style that we all love, and this song has its moments. Yet the fact remains that Kirk Hammet hasn't given us a single guitar solo since ""Reload,"" and this song would be so much better with more riffs and a 2-minute-long solo. But all in all, nice job Metallica."
5,"Debatable quality, I love it.","I'll put this out there right away: This is exactly the same thing as the Some Kind of Monster CD except each have a different title track (SKOM vs Unnamed Feeling). Well, I think it's agreed The Unnamed Feeling was the best track off of St. Anger, so I went for this album rather than SKOM.The live tracks. Hilarious at times, especially Ride the Lightning. Leper Messiah is the best one, but The Four Horsemen, Hit the Lights, and Damage Inc are all strong too. James doesn't sound the greatest, but he does sound better than on St. Anger. I'll leave it at that before I get too repetitive with other reviews.Awesome title track, comical vocals, and great Kill Em All live performances."
2,For Collectors Only,"If you have been thrilled by Alfred Apaka recordings made during the Hawaii Calls era, pass on this one. Combining the lack of audio quality and the absence, for the most part, of engaging melodies makes for only an interesting study of the young Alpaka's capabilities. You will not experience in this collection the thrill of hearing classic ballads such as ""Hawaiian Paradise"" or ""Here (in this Enchanted Place)"" and so on.For something truly memorable, try to find the collections on LP that were recorded during Alpaka's live shows -- with the sound of surf and his banter. Mysteriously, to my knowledge, these have not been reissued on CD. This, however, is where the greatness of Apaka abounds."
3,SEC Regulation of Public Companies,"The book is informative but a bit dated. Given the ongoing changes with SEC regs, it serves almost as much use as an historic perspective as it does as a current guide to SEC regulation."
4,The Lost Art of Living Underwater,"Bob Barth has created a unique portrait of the US Navy's 'can-do' spirit, the quality that typified the character of the early undersea habitat guinea-pigs. He tells the story of the remarkable experiments in saturation diving which began at the submarine base in Groton, Connecticut in the 1950's. For recreational and professional divers the untold story of the men who became aquanauts is just as thrilling and awe-inspiring as anything from the days of the 'space race'. This book is no less remarkable for its rare photographs of the undersea habitats and the small number of brave men who manned them. There is special poignancy in the way Bob Barth describes his own part in the last tragic days of SEALAB, and throughout the book he comes across as a remarkable character."
4,"Good system, user friendliness may improve","Good system with a great sound quality. The CD/DVD is flexible with regards to US/European DVD formats. Altogether lots of features, but along with that lots and lots of wires.Speaker wires are not long enough for a reasonably sized room.To be able to properly use the system, read the manual. Even obvious functionality is not necessarily easy to figure out without it.Anyone figured out why you need 2 remote controls for this combination? Consolidation would be nice, since other electronic gadgets each have their own."
1,Not really a kit,"I bought this for a family member and they where too excited about getting it and getting started with it.The problem is it wasn't a complete kit, and they where unable to find the parts that they needed. so the gift ended up in the trash.It was a waste of my money and I'm embarrassed to have given it."
3,Interesting.,This has been one of the more interesting biographys I read. This book focoses in more on his childhood than more on his life in polotics.
2,Another disapointing Victory record,"Comeback Kid has held a special place in my heart for several years. A band who has been good to my local hardcore scene, CBK was known for consistently solid performances and equally solid albums. I use the past tense because ""Broadcasting"" was one of the biggest disappointments of 2007. The first post Scott album from CBK lacks the urgency and depth of Turn it Around and Wake the Dead. While not terrible, the album sounds like it was made to appeal to an MTV crowd. More polished, and hardly engaging. If you've never heard CBK, do not get this album. Pick up Turn It Around. I have a feeling that this album will go down as either the last listen-able CBK album, or a decided flop in the band's career that will be relegated to the status of the favorite of a small pocket of fans."
3,The first half is great! The second is not as remarkable...,"I absolutely love the first part of this album. The first four tracks are really, really great. But after that the album just gets kind of boring. So if you can get this album for like under $6, it's totally worth it I'd say!"
2,eh,"The production is on par with a lot of other stuff going on, but if you're looking for something as engaging as the first two albums, especially Wake the Dead, don't expect it from Broadcasting. Scott Wade defined the front-end sound of Comeback Kid, and, while sometimes bands can move forward after changing singers, I believe Comeback Kid just moved in a different direction. Not altogether bad, but not the earlier Comeback Kid."
2,YAWN!!!!!,"COMEBACK KID'S LAST TWO ALBUMS WERE FILLED WITH GREAT HOOKS, CATCHY SING-A-LONGS AND SOME PRETTY GOOD BREAKDOWNS. THESE QUALITIES HELPED SET THEM APART FROM A MUCH OVER-LOADED GENRE. SO WHAT HAPPENED? FOR ONE, THE LOSS OF THIER ORIGINAL SINGER REALLY HURT THEM BECAUSE FOUNDING MEMBER ANDREW NEUFELD(ORIGINALLY A GUITARIST) HAS A WEAK DELIVERY. SECONDLY THE HOOKS AND SING-A-LONGS ARE JUST PLAIN BLAND. LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE MUSIC IS FAIRLY UNINTERESTING AND SOUNDS LIKE A THOUSAND OTHER ""OLD SCHOOL MELODIC HARDCORE"" BANDS THAT CLOG UP THE SCENE. THE ONLY REASON I GIVE IT TWO STARS INSTEAD OF ONE IS THE PRODUCTION FROM JASON LIVERMORE AND BILL STEVENSON IS STELLAR (AS USUAL}. DISSAPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST!"
2,warning - lurking sexism,"this book takes an interesting concept and perhaps a genuine phenomena and presents it as a way to promote a sexist agenda. the authors say that central to true love is for women to get back to being traditionally feminine, yin, passive, in the kitchen, (""being not doing"" - the whole nine yards) (i.e. all you women who are too smart and too successful in the world - you'll never find love) and for men to get back to being traditionally masculine - then, the authors say, the two halves can find the happiness of true love. beware beware beware SEXISM LURKS in this book!"
1,The value of research,"I found this book shallow and possessing an almost false ring to the contents. Does Dr. Pressman like to hear himself talk? Where does he form his ideas, values, ideology... ? The book carries no real (other than speculative) substance. I can gather only that the authors delight in self-aggrandizing their views with nothing to back up their thesis other than relationship that the two claim to share...a fairy tale? Anyone could have written this book with half an imagination and a good dose of Disney in their fantasies. Pathetic attempt to publish, shame on the publisher."
3,Never Knew This Was Possible Until-,There needs to be a more updated approach to writing about the subject of this book. I did think the layout and explanation of the subject matter was put in a way most people could understand. I felt there was more that was intentionally not written and if you're going to tackle a subject of this degree why not go all out and say what you know or have experienced? I've gone through this over the past five months of my life and you can't understand unless you've experienced it. It defies explanation until I read this book. I give it 3 out of 5.I thought I was going crazy and knew I wasn't! My family and friends think I'm living in a coocoo's nest!!!!
4,Essential Book for the Serious,"This book should be on the bookshelf of every serious worker in magnetic recording. While there are numerous introductory texts on magnetic recording, Bertram gives the reader in-depth treatments of transition models, non-linear bit shift, non-linear amplitude loss, and overwrite that are based on very clear models of the recording process and lead to useful back-of-the-envelope expressions that are readily compared with experiment. His discussions of medium noise mechanisms (such as fluctuations or jitter in transition position and slope in thin film media) are unexcelled. The level of mathematics assumes a good preparation at the college senior or graudate level. It would be great to have a second edition of this book such that a number of typos and errors could be cleared up."
1,"Extremely difficult to read, not very helpful",This book is extremely complex. The book assumes you already have a great understanding of magnetic recording terminology and physics. I wouldn't need the book if I understood it already. The constant mention of references detracts from the information flow. Complex mathematical formulations are tossed around like there was nothing to them. Terminology & technology is often referenced w/o any explanation to the reader.
4,A good guide to raising questions on the right career match for an ADDer,"Don't expect this book to give you the answers to your struggles with ADD in the workplace. This book is not a cookbook on the issue,and it rather encourages introspection to discover who you really are and then take some action: your job has to match your skills and your interests, and it has to be an activity where your downside shows as little as possible. It is the only way to overcome ADD in an easier way and to achieve success. The author shows, with some story telling, different possibilities for different people. Some advice is also given about optimizing performance at work taking into account ADD traits (I wish she had been a bit more comprehensive in this part). Overall a very good book and an important addition to the ADD library."
3,Not worth the money!,"While the bed is comfortable before it springs a leak, leaks happen all too often. The one year warranty is grudgingly fullfilled once, and once only. A month and a half between leaks seems short to me, but the company seems to be satisfied with them. I've been very disappointed with the bed, and especially customer service."
1,so many leakage occurred...,"I bought this product, Coleman Raised Twin Quickbed with Wrap 'N' Roll Storage, several weeks ago and I was suffering this air bed because of so many leakages. I found 5 holes on it and I needed to figure out how to cover it. The worst part was I had to wake up to re-inflate it at the middle of night. It sucked. I will never buy or recommend this product to my friends again."
1,Leaks and Coleman Warranty is worthless (2nd time),"I've had two of these in my family. I bought it right after one of my cousins bought it. It looked good (new) and was raised so was ideal for guest-rooms.Both of my beds have been exchanged once (within a month), and one of them have now lost air again with very mild use. I am not even sure if this is made for camp-ground when it can't stand the home-carpet.I've bought a replacement bed, greatland (target) twin-size. This one is much better, and is much sturdier than the Coleman bed."
3,Wish it didn't have the built-in pillow.,"We bought this bed to replace our aerobed that was put away wet after camping and mildewed. This item is definitely comparable in quality, but the built-in pillow makes it a pain in the neck if you are a side sleeper like me who prefers a goose down pillow. I tried sleeping upside-down on it but didn't like the elevated foot feeling.Nonetheless a good buy, especially if you don't have a Cervical Spondylosis/often forget pillows when camping!"
2,"Looses air, not comfortable","We thought being made by Coleman, we would be "" Ok "" with their beds.I agree with the reviewer above. We had this bed for about a year now, and It leaks so bad, the last time we wound up on the floor in the middle of the night.Its not comfortable, looses air all the time, we constantley kept filling it with air everytime we camped. I thought that was normal with air mattress, but not to wake up on the floor !I wouldnt recommend this mattress to anyone !"
4,Consequensence of Modernity,"The title itself sounds dangerous, however, the time I read this book makes me aware how far humanities came into destroying the human race. This is the reason why I advocate to all students and reader to fight back against globalization because this is part of what the book it says. The main core of the book or Anthony Giddens thought is that reflexivity of modernity is dangerous. Human are becoming distrusted, playing something that is move by self-centered interest. I know there are consequences of modernity, that is when we abuse our knowledge or intellect, when we are using this modern technology in destruction and in wrong way."
2,The consequence of modernity,"Anythony Giddens, book ""The consequences of modernity,"" is excellently phrased and written. However, the book tends to be a bit too concentrated, providing for an interesting night of reading. I was assigned this book for a sociology class and found it a difficult read. I did enjoy his arguements and thesis. I don't reccomend this book for pleasure reading!"
2,Not Much Humor Here.,"I bought a double-sided copy of this book, along with the next in the series, The Pirates! In an Adventure with Ahab (Whaling). I read both, hoping the second would be better than this one, but was disappointed. There is almost no action, funny awkward situations or even inappropriate material that could bring a laugh. The characters in the story, especially the Captain, are mostly incompetent and dishonest, not very funny characteristics. Try Bored of the Rings or a George Carlin book, heck, even Dave Barry is funnier than these time-wasters."
4,"No problem, works like a champ.","I was very nervous about installing the NSW 2006 after reading the Amazon reviews, I had absolutely no problem. I removed previous Norton products, restarted, and installed the NSW 2006 in about 40 minutes.My system is working just like with the NSW 2005."
1,Pretty Darn disappointing....,"Peter Norton... the original programmer/publisher... shouldbe really upset that his NAME is associated with this product.I have used Norton products since the early MS-DOS daysand up until now I have always considered Norton THE SOFTWAREfor anti-virus and utilities.I am a subscriber to ComCast and as such I get FREEMcAfee A/V, Firewall, and Spyware Protection. It's freeso I use it.. but when the Norton Suite came out I wasall over it. What a let down.It hangs, crashes, has conflicts.... basically a huge wasteof $60.You don't, like another reviewer said, have to do a totalre-install of the OS to get rid of it.... you just have tobe patient... cause it aint easy. You'll need Registry cleaning tools and a good defragmenter.... Norton does not want toleave.To wrap this up..... Norton SystemWorks 2006 actuallyCAUSES more problems than it was supposed to fix....In good consceince I can't re-sell ( I can't return it ) itto anyone.... so now I have a $60 coaster. Yay for me!"
1,AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!,"Title says it all. Unless you enjoy spending long hours throuhgout the night trying to salvage what you can of your files, please just stay away from this product. If I had to use this, I would ONLY install the antivirus portion and NOTHING ELSE!Even after finally being able to disable GoBack, which took about an hour to do, and uninstalling from within the control panel, my program files folder still shows the program folder intact and when I try to uninstall Live Update, it tells me that I still have Norton products installed, when nothing else shows up in Add/Remove Programs!Someone aught to tell one of their lawyer friends about this and sue them so that we call all get our money back!"
3,Just Please Don't Install GoBack,"The package overall is good. I have used 4 previous versions. This is the first with GoBack. I thought it would be a novel idea to include in the fresh install on my new harddrive. After running for a few weeks, things started to get slower to the point where you weren't sure if you clicked on it so you wind up opening it five times. I trace the problem to GoBack. First I thought it was a virus because I compared the Processes in Task Manager to a backup computer. All the items were running at 10x the memory usage. I got the nerve to just uninstall it and notice a dramatic speed increase. Fortunately I had a printscreen of pre and post uninstall. Rundll32.exe was 35, 956 before and 5,264 after. Even it's own programs like Navapsvc.exe was at 36,292 before and 1,032 after. I don't think Norton is a resource hog just that they need to fix GoBack. BEWARE of the junker program."
1,Norton Systemworks = PURE EVIL,"Stay away from this program. It messed up my computer to where I almost had to reformat the hard drive. Luckily, it looks like I'm OK just restoring the computer to an earlier date. I've reinstalled Norton Internet Security 2007 only and am praying that works okay. There's a reason all of these reviews are so negative. Norton, how could you???"
2,Disappointed,"I was using Norton Systemsworks 2003 with great satisfaction - and then the company stopped supporting the product forcing a new investment. I assumed the 2006 version would be an improvement and installed it, following their directions closely. It worked intitially, but then completely disabled my operating system. The troubleshooting portion of the instructions actually includes this as a scenario and instructs the user to disable and uninstall one of its ""GoBack"" feature and cautions the user to contact the manufacturer of the computer to determine whether there was any damage to partitions in your disk! Not very comforting. Now my computer runs slower than ever. I am not a happy customer and will not use any of their products in the future."
1,GoBack trashes hard drives!!,"If you purchase this product, I strongly suggest not installing GoBack during setup. I have a system with 2 hard drives where the second drive is primarily used for backup. I had GoBack installed, and there was a problem with the backup drive. My PC would not boot to Windows because GoBack was not able to access all of its data. I tried unhooking the backup drive, and still couldn't boot to Windows. During bootup, there is a GoBack splash screen saying ""press spacebar for options"", but pressing spacebar yields an error message, followed by ""press any key to restart"". Without being able to get to Windows, there is no way to disable GoBack, and GoBack will not allow Windows to start (not even in safe mode). I have now lost the data on my hard drive, as well as the data on my backup. Thank you Norton."
1,this is a pro-virus software,"I wanted to protect me brand new computer from virus attack, and finally i got the kind of virus by installing this software. I installed this software and it crashed totally my computer. I paid 70 $ more to retreive my data and then I am going to reinstalle xp to the computer. I think they should rembourse us for total cost and waist of time."
1,A Complete Disaster That Hosed My PC,"This program has never worked right, causes endless error messages, and now thinks it is not activated (even though I activated it) and the activation process crashes.And you cannot remove it. Uninstalling from CD or the Add/Remove control panel fails. You also can't uninstall from safe mode.The Symantec ""support"" site only has utilities to install the 2002 version. Nothing for 2006. And you can't call or email for help without paying a per-minute chargeAnd of course you can't install new anti-virus or anything without getting rid of it first.Looks like I will have to reinstall Windows to get this infection off my PC.DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM or anything from Symantec unless you feel like wasting a day or two rebuilding your PC. It's a total disaster."
1,Terrible product,"Yes to what everyone else has said. Problems installing, some features don't work for no discernable reason, reasource hog, long startup time, etc. I bought this and Ghost 10 and I consider that completely wasted money. I'd strongly recommend going with another company for software of this type."
1,Save yourself big headaches by not buying this product......,"Facts:PC user since 1983PC Tools supporter in early 1990s then regular Norton supporter, updating annually.System: IBM Thinkpad X31, Windows ProfessionalHave recommended Norton to many friends and associates over the years.Regarding the 2006 version of Systemworks my advice is simple: Save yourself money and lots of time and grief and do not buy this product or load it onto your system. If you want to waste time and money, then load it onto your system but first make certain that everything is backed up and that you have a reliable system restore point.Prediction: Symantec will continue to sell product to novices after this disasterous release, but not to any halfway savvy computer user who will look to other vendors."
2,Disappointed! Slows 'puter down to a crawl...,"Really just wanted to renew my AV scrip (SystemWorks '03)...Shoulda just done that, but instead went with SW 2006...Had to use WinPatrol to disable System Doctor (found this tip from reading above SW 2006 reviews)...Runs OK now...Just renew what you have if you're happy with it... Don't upgrade to this version"
1,Big problems with Norton Systemworks 2006,"I have been on the Symantec Priority Help line for 45 minutes after two days of frustration. I have used Norton Utilities for years with few problems, but this 2006 version is riddled with problems. I can't install it on one of my computers after repeated trys in a totally pristine environment. I had to uninstall it Systemworks from my laptop because it caused one of my important programs to freeze repeatedly. I am sending it back tomorrow. Norton has turned out a bad product and offers no help."
1,Forced to give it a star,"Steer clear of Norton/Symatec products. My HP came with Norton SystemWorks 2006 trial version and I thought it wss fine. Assumed the installation of the product would be quick and painless. Don't remember all that went wrong, but one thing is that I was told by customer support after the fact that I should have uninstalled the trial version before installing the version I had purchased. It took forever to install even when there weren't problems. After suffering with a computer that had slowed to a crawl I was able to determine that it was due to a setting in my Norton Internet Security 2006 program. I finally stopped using it even though I had purchased a two-year version. The Windows uninstall program chugged along for quite a while before announcing that the program could not be removed. Got the Norton removal tool from the web and that's what I'm doing right now. I had not been using the product for months, but it is so hard to get rid of, that I hadn't done so."
4,Good anitvirus software,Systemworks traditionally has done everything with satisfaction for me. But I recently tried trend micros pc-cillin 2007 internet security and I thought that was edge above all the other software out there I've tried. I catches just about everything.
1,Terrible.,"Ack, when I reboot after installation my laptop hangs. If you have this I suggest only installing Antivirus.I accidently installed the whole thing, and am currently installing XP again as a result.Definitely a waste of money."
1,Bad Idea,I bought both System Works and Internet Security and now Windows is finished. Crashes for no good reasons and then refuses to boot. Appears Norton has huge registry issues with their own software. And their tech support really stinks.Avoid at all costs...this program is a death trap!
1,Would Rate 0 Stars If It Was an Option!,"This download I purchased has pretty much made my system unusable as now I have no antivirus software at all. Upgrading from Norton 2003- once installed I was unable to download the antivirus dictionary. 3 times I ""Chatted"" with their online help which gave me instructions which were inaccurrate. Said my pc was not in sync with their database. I have spent over 4 hours of my weekend time trying to get this program to work. Looks like a serious bug. To talk on the phone 'live' they charge 29$! There's a deal after paying 59$ for the download!!I have asked for a refund and am going to buy Macaffey."
1,Security Gone Amok!,"Bottom line: in an effort to protect their software against hackers, many legitimate customers (of which I am one) get software that refuses to install itself properly. I have used Norton since the days of DOS. After my latest experience, I will go elsewhere. There are other very good choices available. After years of being a loyal customer, they have lost me. I consider myself to be above-average in terms of computer savvy, for whatever that's worth. Beware of this software."
1,First Norton product I have had trouble with.,"Read the reviews of the others here. They are right. Stay away from this product. If you must install, please make backup or image of your drive. Installed 2006. After pulling my hair out and not being able to do anything with it, had to do a clean install. Went back to 2005. Who wrote the code on this? JUNK!"
1,Norton System Works Destroys My Computer,"I recently tried to update my Norton Systemworks. Halfway through the update, I got a message telling me it was unable to uninstall my old Norton Systemworks. I tried to back out of the installation at that point, but was unable. I called the Norton company, spent an hour on the phone with a tech, only to have them tell me it was my computer. I assured them that I was just using my computer, which was fine, and now it doesn't work. They told me there was nothing further that they could do, and that I would have to call a computer service company. I found out that the uninstall process corrupted my operating system, causing me to lose everything on my hard drive, and requiring a new operating system. I have run into other people who had exactly the same problem, with no help from the Norton Company. I will never again buy a Norton product. I only wish I could get my money back from them."
2,Disappointed,"Have used Norton for years, but the upgrade to 2006 has been problematic. Spyware undetected by Systemworks 2004 prevents 2006 from synchronizing. 2006 cannot detect it either. Customer support of little help and clearly not based in the US. I doubt I will come back to Norton next time."
1,Absolutely the Worst,"I had given up on Norton some time back but the recurring Office Max offer of System Works 2006 Free unfortunately lured me back into the fold. (...)Sadly, you are better never trying to get the product free in the first place. It's a disaster even at no charge. Just read accumulated reviews on the install nightmares and Norton's historically intrusive approach which slows down not only the install but your entire computer to the point that sometime a reinstall of your operating system is the only way to set things right.Alternatives to consider: AVG is a totally free anti-virus alternative and V-Com's Fix-it-Utilities seems to work as well when it comes to tweaking your system, with a far less intrusive much faster program. Bye! Bye! Norton!"
4,Good Product but be careful.,"Systemworks 2006 has gotten some bad reviews, but I think this primarily is because people just put it in and install it without thinking what is already on their machines. I've found that you must remove all elements of previous versions of any Norton (antivirus, security, antispam, etc.)otherwise conflicts arise. I'm not sure, but if you have McAfee on your machine I would bet there would also be a conflict. However, I installed Norton (after removing all previous versions) with Spy Doctor, Registry Mechanic, and Webroot on the machine without a glitch. Hope this is helpful."
2,Fifty Bucks A Year To Renew Virus Definitions,Had this product for a year and the virus definition update subscription expired. So I click on renew and get to the purchase screen. They wanted to charge me $49.99 to renew for a year. STAY AWAY FROM THE NORTON MONEYPIT!!
4,read the instructions!,"I don't own this, yet. I am still using the 2004 version. Why don't people read the instructiosn which CLEARLY state you MUST uninstall previous versions of any Norton product BEFORE installing the new version. Of course you can't uninstall the previous version after installing the new version, half the files are missing of have been over written. Norton Internet Security and Norton System works are NOT compatible since both have Norton Anti Virus and even in custom install not installing the Anti Virus is NOT an option. Install one or the other but NEVER both. I don't install the Go-Back because I couldn't get it to work either, but that's what the windows system restore is for, right? So custom install and opt not to install Go-Back."
5,you guys just don't know computers,"I have been using Norton for years. I have never had a problem with it at all. I am going to buy 2007 as well. If you want the most reliable anti-virus software out there, buy this product. Norton Cleanup works better than XP products, that is why it is replacing windows components when installed. Win Doctor is great for a registry cleaner.Don't believe all the negative people, most just hop on the band wagon. Norton system works has always been my favorite, and always will be"
4,Good and Bulky,"I've been using Norton products for over 10 years.Each year they get more complex and more bulky.However, once the product is configured properlyit tends to run well, detects intrusions and canimprove the health of just about any Windows based system.The online update process seems to work well.However if you change your hardware system configurationyou may have to re-activate the product.The default (out-of-box) settings ALWAYS needs tweaking.The 2007 version is even more bloated than this version."
1,System WORTHLESS is more like it,"I can't even comment on the actual System Works application because I never got it to run - it ruined my system right after install! Once I installed it, it asked for a reboot, then came back wtih ""Load Error! Press a key to reboot..."" which just lead to the error message again, and again, and again.A chat with tech support (after an hour wait) revealed that there are problems with the GoBack files, so I had to create a bootable CD, and do all kind of things which I haven't been able to do yet since my burner software doesn't have Image capability - necessary for creating this bootable cd.Don't buy it, don't install it, don't use it - uninstall everything Norton/Symantec and never go back. I'll be lucky if I ever get my computer working again.....Thanks Symantec!!!!!"
1,Complicated product that does not work in general..,"I wish I had read the reviews of this product before I purchased. I had used Norton in the past and was fairly satisfied but had a horrible experience when installing system works on windows XP. Long story short- I had to remove all of the Norton software because my computer would not even start! What a nightmare- after working with computer savvy friend, we figured out what the problem was- Norton software! Once I was able to get my computer up and running again, I removed the software and now my computer runs like a dream.Plus- the user interface of software was not user-friendly. So many gizmo's and gadgets that I did not what was going on. The software would be up dating things in the background- just out of control and overkill in my opinion.Definitely would agree with most of the reviews of this product in general. Thumbs down.."
2,Systemworks 2006...Nothing but trouble.This product could have been good.,"I spent three hours helping a friend uninstall norton systemworks..He thought he could install this over norton nis2006 !!Wrong!! these programs arent compatible with each other..Both have versions of noton anti-virus 2006.!!! you cant run both...They fought each other until he got a grey screen.Nothing worked!!! I had to perform a clean windows install,and installed norton 2005 antivirus and the 2005 norton firewall...Now all is well...? we have to wait 15 days to see if the registration fails...You install at your own risk...Upgrading is not always better...You be the judge of this."
1,Unable to get a replacement CD for defective one sold,"I purchased Norton SystemWorks 2006 from Amazon. The CD displayed the error message ""The wrong volume is in the drive. Please insert volume NSW2006 into drive E:"" The product package only came with one CD.This is an indication that I was sold a bad or incomplete CD disk. I tried to find the error/resolution on Symantec's service website; however without any luck. I called their 900-number and paid the service call only to have the technician tell me that I had to purchase a duplicate CD at a cost of $10.00 plus $9.95 s&h; because they delivered a bad product.I have been a Norton customer since the early 1990's. Even though they have a good product in SystemWorks, which I have purchased each year since it came out, sadly because of their lack of customer service I am no longer a customer of Symantec, and I have a 2006 version I can do nothing with."
1,"Don't buy this year's version, Systemworks 2006","I installed Systemworks 2006 about ten days ago, and for ten days have been struggling with why my computer often takes several minutes to start up, and usually crashes on Shutdown. After wasting perhaps 12 hours scanning the Internet for solutions to Shutdown problems, and trying different fixes, I finally tried turning off GoBack. Voila! So I figured I'd go back to NSW 2005. There my troubles began. Uninstalling 2006 and reinstalling 2005 crashed in the middle of GoBack installation, trashing parts of my Registry and numerous system files. Getting rid of the partly installed GoBack and getting the system running again (I have yet to completely restore the Registry) has so far taken me another six hours.Don't risk it. Don't buy it.- David, in Gloucester, MA"
1,install problem,"Wasted an evening trying to install on Windows XP. First, it interrupted, since I didn't uninstall 2003 version, skimpy documentation didn't highlight that. Then, after an hour it got almost to the end, it complained about excessive disk activity. There was no application running, but I had left screen saver on. Ok, no screen saver, no application, still, after another hour, error! Had to reinstall 2003 version from CD, including another hours of updates for it."
1,Very Bad Product,"Could not get it to install properly on a relatively new computer. Couldn't register the product, can't open the program when you click on the icon, can't uninstall using add/remove programs or the CD.Please, for your piece of mind, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. They have a great tech support website, problem is -- none of their solutions work. I'm very disappointed with this product and with myself for spending nearly $70. to purchase it."
1,Systemworks 2006,I use a swappable hard drive for my C: and D:. Norton SystemWorks 2006 GoBack module infects the MBR of all drives (I have 3 extra drives) such that no other (non-GoBack) O/S's will see the partitions. Uninstalling Systemworks failed to completely remove GoBack from two of the drives thus destroying their respective partition tables. I never even got to evaluate the rest of the product.
1,Not as good as it used to be,"Installed this on my laptop and desktop computers. One installation was late in 2005, the other was in 2nd quarter of 2006. Both have tried to fail. The laptop will no longer do automatic updates. I can manually download and install the updates, but it is a bit of a hassle. The desktop will no longer download the Symantec updates at all. I attempted several uninstalls and reinstalls, won't do it. The only remedy is to take both computers to a computer shop and needlessly pay someone to fix the mess this junk software has made on both computers. Because of the problems, I've run into several problems, mostly related to .cab files when I attempt downloads. I've switched to AVG and Zone Alarm - both FREE and they work."
1,Stay Away from Norton Systemworks 2006,"I purchased and installed NSW because I thought I was being smart and safe with Norton product. I must have spent 50 hours trying to get this product to work on my 3.06Ghz Dell Superspeed computer, and I finally gave up and demanded that they refund my purchase price. In the process of trying to get this product to work on my machine, I uninstalled and reinstalled it countless times. I also had to uninstall all other Symantec products, including ACT! which I have used faithfully for more than 10 years! Stay away from Norton Systemworks 2006 - it's a failure, and the Tech support people are hopelessly unable to find any solutions."
5,WORLD'S BIGGEST OTOWN FAN,THIS BOOK IS GREAT ABOUT OTOWN IT TELLS THEIR HARDSHIPS MAKING THE BAND MAKING FRIENDS THEN LOSING THEM. i AM SUPRISED HOW THEY MAKE IT. COMING FROM THE WORLD'S #1 OTOWN FAN IT IS A GREAT BOOK!
1,The Hokey Pokey,"This book is so hokey! I actually did get quite a few laughs out of it, but I don't think it was intended to be a joke book."
2,"Interesting, but...","An interesting book, but the frequent sexual discriptions take away from the story line. How does the main character have any energy left to fight any battles or do anything else after a night and morning with his ""mates"" (wifes). A 15 year old boy would find this book wonderful, but for me, it was just OK."
3,okay,"This is the most unsual of the DC Sniper books. It's not a defense like Chief Moose's book, nor is it sensational like the two other books by reporters. In Mr. Ward's book he tells the story of each shooting, and because he is a native of the area he describes as only a native can what the scene of each crime looks like today and how it looked when he was a boy. Ward also explains why these killings so horrified 4 million people who lived in the sniper's range. Each killing took place while the victims were doing normal, everyday suburban things. The killers attacked the old, the young, white, black and latino.When Ward is discussing the crimes his book is quite good but when he gets to the heart of the book--the religious discussion he's not as good. He doesn't take any really strong stands. His comments are mild enough to offend no-one but they won't inspire anyone either. I found that a bit frustrating."
4,Good.,I saw this knife on Caio Italia & it looked like it sliced through tomatoes very easily. MaryAnn said it was good for soft foods. I have tried it on tomatoes & it works well. Tried cheese but the result wasn't as nice. The slice wasn't smooth. Maybe it was the cheese I tried. Overall I really like the knife.
3,Could have more depth to the various categories,"Not for the novice, yet you don't have to be a tech to absorb 75% of the material. I would have preferred more in-depth coverage of the various topics. Would still buy the book knowing what I now know about it, but, will have to find another tome to allow better understanding of the subject."
2,Lots and lots of average content,"The book looks impressive, but as I stood at the rack and read through it -- I noticed I wasn't learning much of anything new. I then picked up Scott Mueller's even larger Upgrading & Repairing PCs title, and it was clear that Mueller's book (now in it's 10th edition) was the book for me.This is a solid book, but for my money, it isn't nearly as strong as Mueller's book."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed to find out that the 5th edition does not include an electronic version of the text on the CDROM. I was hoping to be able to carry around just the CDROM along with my laptop because it just is not practical to lug around a book that's about the size of a big city phone book and weighs maybe 10 pounds.
5,Fits right the first time.,I was a bit leery of getting this on-line but it was a perfect fit. Better price than I could find anywhere else too.
5,This is fun for all ages!,"This was bought for our 10 year old son, for Christmas. He loves digging for the treasures. The problem is, for him, is that all his siblings and parents love digging up the treasures too. So, this would be good for any age. We will probably get his other siblings one next year for Christmas too. We have not played the game yet...we are still trying to dig out the hidden items."
3,tie dye experience,"The shirt was beautiful - very colorful and great workmanshipBut, the sizes should be more generous as they do shrink."
5,Fabulous story and characters!!,"This whole series by Claudia Bishop is excellent and I can't say enough about them. The Quilliam sisters make you feel right at home in Hemlock Falls and the rest of the cast entertains you the whole way through! I HIGHLY suggest reading all of Claudia Bishop's books, I am waiting for her next books!!"
4,Refreshingly original,"This was the first book I've read in a long time with an original plot, characters and theme. No dashing heroes, love triangles or vengeful enemies, just the adventurous spirit and determination of an old woman who found life and purpose beyond the ordinary."
5,Remant population,I found Moon's style of writing to easy to read. The story was about how the elders can be side-linedwhen they still have talents they want to share. And opinions they realize they shouldn't.
5,Excellent condition,This book came in excellent condition. It also came within the alotted time-frame promised. I would recommend this seller.
3,A sedate book with a strong character,"This book has produced ecstatic reactions in many quarters but failed to do much for me. The characterisation is indeed strong and the writing is excellent, but the plot is predictable and rather thin for a full length novel.One of the Amazon customer reviews exults ""This book should be read by all women"". In fact the women in this book are, I suspect, intentionally stereotypical (or maybe archetypal): the cranky but bright grandmother, the nagging wife, the village slut, the attention-seeking bimbo, the insensitive career-woman. It's a story whose (worthy) moral tries to be ""don't patronize"", but somehow ends up being ""don't patronize anyone who doesn't deserve it"". Not quite the same thing..."
1,Really?,"I bought this book as a paperback when it came out for six dollars, and it was a charming read. I especially liked the insight on family relationships and the motivations of caregivers.But looking to buy another copy, wanting to read it again, I find the price for the kindle version is ten dollars? For a digital version I can't lend to anybody or take to a used book store to exchange for other books? And the paperback is now over twelve!?!?!?! Really?"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A book in three parts. A colony on a planet pulls out, as their sponsor has sold it to someone else. One elderly woman decides to stay behind.She enjoys her freedom, to start with, and starts investigating things she couldn't do before.Eventually, she starts a relationship with the natives of the planet, which becomes important when yet another corporate survey team turns up wanting to use the planet."
4,A craftily woven warning about discrimination,"This well crafted story gently draws you in with a slow, scene setting start, then continues on to delightfully up-end many time-worn Science Fiction first contact memes. Delightfully different."
4,Interesting idea and character,"I found Elizabeth Moon's, REMNANT POPULATION, fascinating because the main character is an older woman. In late life, she makes a revolutionary decision to stay on a planet without her community. Through leading her normal life alone, she creates a richer and more fulfilling life for herself among the indigenous population. She's spunky, capable, self doubting yet brave. The best part of the book is that she becomes important and appreciated in her new community. This book not only has an interesting story and main character, but great aliens as well."
3,"Entertaining, interesting premise.","The concept of an elderly woman purposefully stranding herself on an alien planet as her colony departs forever is brilliant. The aliens were pretty well conceived, though it would have been more interesting if Ms. Moon could have elaborated on the planet's alien ecosystem. I grew somewhat tired of the ongoing detailed descriptions of Ofelia's daily living activities . . . cooking, going to bed, and gardening for instance. The book did captivate my imagination however, and I was glad I read it."
4,A hidden treasure,"I enjoyed Elizabeth Moon's early work, but haven't read much of her material lately. I stumbled on this by accident, and was very pleased by it. Indeed, the heroine is an old lady, who would seem to be woefully under-equipped by both nature and training for the task she takes up. The writing is very fine, and Ms. Moon, as always, has a eye for details that makes the novel very vivid.This should appeal to many, including those who are not always fantasy or sci-fi fans."
5,Great alternative to OEM,"Purchased to replace an OEM toner cartridge. Assumed that the Xerox name came with it a high likelihood of quality. I was correct. The toner cartridge works perfectly. If it gets the advertised quantity of copies, even better. The seller was extra prompt in shipping (that day!) and I had it in my hands 2 days after ordering. Can't beat that for service."
2,Toner review,The toner that I bought - I am not sure if it is old or what. It is giving me lousy printouts. I just can't use it. I bought it on the basis of the Xerox name.
3,Color?,The color of the shoes is not black. It's more of a slate gray/silverish color. The color on the side of the box said black too- but it's not black. Other than that- the shoe is true to size and fits very comfortably!
4,Great Young Adult Fantasy,"While this is the second in a series, after ""The Safe-Keeper's Secret"" it has almost entirely different characters and would stand alone perfectly well. TSKS felt more medieval, while this one feels more like 1800, with the waltz and a music box, but no trains or other signs of industrialization. Magic is integrated into the culture fairly modestly, with a few people having special powers or qualities. While there's some evil, like the first book, this one seemed a bit lighter to me. I'm afraid I saw through the major plot device immediately, but then I'm far from the target teenager audience. That didn't keep me from enjoying the tale. Shinn is superb at creating close communities of characters, attractive cultures, and visually arresting images. I can't wait to read the third and final book in this series, Dream Maker's Magic."
4,Interesting good read,I liked this series. They were very well done and beautifuly written. There is a lot of adult themes is this series but it was well done.
1,"Not so great ""Great Things"" book","I should be able to say 503 great things about a book with a title like this. But in reality, I have one great thing to say: it didn't cost me an arm and a leg so I don't feel so bad tossing it on the shelf and forgetting about it. Sure, some of the ""great things"" were funny and I'll probably be saying ""I wasn't born gay. It was sheer luck"" for a long time, but much of the book is based on ridiculously outdated stereotypes. I give it one star, but only because Amazon wouldn't let me skip that question."
1,I hated it. So ridiculously stereotypical,"I bought this book a couple years ago, and I must say I definitely agree with the reviewer who gave it one star. There were a lot of things that either seemed to be stereotypical or I just didn't get. I'd give it zero stars, but that's not an option."
5,Thanks for helping our relationship!!!,"The best thing about being gay is my boyfriend Jordo, he is really sexy in his g-string. That is definetly one of the 501 best things about being disgustingly gay. The other 500 can be found in our room at night. This book has inspired us to broaden our horizons on three somes."
2,Skip it,"Very few of the 501 things struck home with me, and I didn't find most of all that amusing.Some were cute (""You think big boobs are hilarious."" or ""You've been to a bris. You've been to a christening. You've been to a 'new age' service. You've been to a first communion. You've been to a seance. You have a carefully considered evaluation of the food after each."").But I wouldn't spend the $ on this one."
3,"fun, smart but sometimes believable","As an account of the disastrous Afghan campaign of the early Victorian era, this novel succeeds beyond expectations. In terms of character and plot development, one sometimes gets the impression that any movie of the Indiana Jones series is more realistic. Only for history buffs (like myself)."
2,"Not easily offended, but George MacDonald Fraser did it.","A little too offensive. I wasn't able to get passed the ugly, outdated racial and sexist attitudes, not to mention its general disregard towards animals. If you are expecting P.G. Wodehouse, think again. I can see George MacDonald Fraser's Henry Flashman character having been considered hilarious 40 years ago. Maybe even as recent as 25-30 years ago. But not today.I have outgrown this type of humor, and I believe that many people will find this character and his world hard to stomach. Reading this book was like having one's ""nose rubbed in it."" The good news is, we (as humans) have come further than we may realize in terms of social progress."
5,A GREAT READ!!!,"By a happy coincidence, I saw this book at a bookstore and the picture of the Indian girl caught my eye. So I bought it, and am delighted that I did. It is a great book. Historically accurate, funny, and a wild read. I have now read 6 books in this series, and am looking forward to reading the rest soon. Flashman the rogue, the rascal, bigotted coward, is the ideal anti-hero. And like all rascals assumes the worst about people, especially his pea-brained wife whom he suspects of sleeping around, even though there is no evidence of it. In Flashman's lady Mr Fraser gives extracts from Mrs. Flashman's diary, and while she comes across being a flirt, and brainless, there is no evidence of her sleeping around. Well perhaps in a new volume in this series Mr. Fraser will really clear up the issue once and for all. I higly recommend this book, and the other 6 that I have read."
5,You can't go wrong with Harry Flashman,My father initiated me to Flashman a long time ago. I am passing the pleasure to my son. Flashman is a joy to read and in insightful observer of human nature and history. The Flashman series has fueled my historical curiosity over the years. You can't go wrong spending time with Harry Flashman. I am sorry George MacDonald Fraser is no longer with us to keep the adventure going.
4,Great stuff,Yes there are some politically incorrect parts here but even though this book is some 30 years old it seems to be meant that way. Set in Victorian age England it has so many delightful tongue in cheek moments it will have you in stiches. The fly on the wall historical stuff also gave enjoyment to this amateur history buff. I'd recommend and cant wait to get to the next installment of the Flashy series and see if they are all this much fun!
4,"Don't be put off by title, great reading and addicting","Why an 8? Well Flashman takes some time to digest but once you've accepted the ""hero"" for what he is it is a wonderful trip through History. Fraser has a keen eye and makes the period come alive with richly researched detail. You end up wishing that there was indeed a Flashman. A British Gentleman, O.B.E. and all that, once told me Flashman was one of his favorites. Take that as a high compliment Mr. Fraser. My only gripe is that the long awaited Civil War novel has yet to appear. Try one, they are very re-readable and at the moment available. Flashman at the Charge and Flashman and the Great Game will provide a very enjoyable start after the first Flashman."
2,Boys Adventure Book,"Reasonably well written but a bit too on the ""adventurer"" side for me. Interesting but dated, not a bad choice for someone interested in historical fiction."
5,the best of Flashman,"This is the first and the best of the Flashman series. I first read this book back in 1990 and it combines history with a good dash of humor. George MacDonald Fraser brings the British Empire and the men who made it to life. Typical of some the comments in the book is when Brigadier Shelton comments on his Commander-in Chief shooting himself in the arse, "" no doubt in an attempt to blow his brains out. He couldn't have missed by much"" I definitely recommend this book to anyone.Unfortunately the Flashman series got a bit stale with the years. The only one worth reading after this is Flashman and the great game."
5,"Entertaining, educational, humorous, historical, bawdy","The Flashman novels are entertaining, educational, humorous, historical, and bawdy. Harry Flashman is not a character you are intended to like, but you sympathize with his point of view as often as not.In the end, you can put up with him only because he suffers so much form his fears and hardships. Along the way you get a jaundiced view of British political and military leaders of the 19th century, from a commentator who knows his subject.Harry Flashman, is a scoundrel, cheat, bully, cad, lecher, toady, and coward, who manages to get caught up in every major military campaign. In spite of himself, Harry finds women and honors falling upon him at every turn. All undeserved, but then that's the way he prefers it."
4,Terrific Action Writing,"""Flashman: From the Flashman Papers 1839 - 1842"" is fun book, suitable for the beach or a long trip, with first rate action writing. My favorite section shows how Flashman, following his instinct for selfishness and self-preservation, became the sole English survivor, as well as the hero, at doomed Fort Piper in the assault on Jallalabad (pages 183-215 in the Plume edition). I was also moved by the descriptions of the poorly lead British army in its suicidal withdrawal from Kabul (161-183). One complaint: In this first ""Flashman"" book, Flashy's lechery begins as amusing, but eventually turns dark and disturbing."
1,One Star Too Many!,"I have two regrets. One, that I wasted hard-earned money on a book that I cannot even finish reading. Two, that I am required to give this book even one star. I understood a ""rogue"" to be a ""mischievous person."" The character ""Harry Flashman"" is pond scum. In particular, I do not find the beating of women humorous or entertaining. The best thing I can do with this book is recycle the paper. The best thing you can do is find a different author."
1,Not suggested reading for your bookclub,"This was an unfortunate selection of my book club. While I like reading historical fiction, I refused to finish this book. The main character of this book has no redeeming qualities. He's a coward, a rapist and total jerk. I'm amazed to see so many positive reviews of this book. I do not understand how this book merited sequels."
5,Flashman! The Journey Begins.,I bought this for an American pal of mine who had never heard of Flashman. I have read this book twice and will probably read it again at some point in time. We are stationed in Afghanistan at present and I recommend Flashman for anyone deploying here. Not just for the entertaining comedy but also for an insight into the Afghan mentality. All the characters and characteristics described in Flashman can be found in Afghanistan today. It is 'Boys Own' comedy but it could also be a manual for military drawdown. Flashman's desire to escape from the brutality of Aghanistan coupled with his admiration for some of the natives he meets along the way could be easily transposed onto the contemporary scene.This book should be compulsory reading and study for all military management.
4,Good Show Ole Flashy,"Probably there is little I can say that hasn't already been said in one or two of the other reviews below. The story reminds me of the movies that were made in the thirties, starring Cary Grant and Victor MacGlothlin. Stout upper lip, carry on for England and the Queen (and all that rot). Best of all, Flashy is such a bounder, but is forthright enough to admit it.I can see why this series is so popular, because it never takes itself seriously. If you keep in mind as to the 'times' it was purportedly written in, you can get by some of the terrible stereotyping that occurs in the story. But, I would never look to have Flashy made 'politically correct', he is who he was."
2,Excellent book,This turned out to be a lighter video than expected.I would stick with the book which is excellent and ignore the video.Brett
5,an awsome book,"This is a good book for any ages but better for younger kids, but i still love these books i have the CD's my brother and i listen to them ALL the time, they are fun to listen and Jessica IS A VERY CREATIVE song writer and an author, the CD's and the books are amazing and i think everyone should get her CD's and books!!!"
3,Not as much about the Sadr uprising as the title would seem to indicate,"...but still illuminating, particularly on the subject of the haphazard, ill-planned and ill-thought-out nature of the CPA's governing of occupied Iraq. That the author, ostensibly in charge of an entire province, had no way to communicate with his superiors other than a Hotmail account and a satellite phone is frightening. The contractors widely used in Iraq like Halliburton/KBR are shown as mostly unreliable if not incompetent."
1,Pure Fiction,"I could not agree more with the last two reviews. The only reason I gave this one star is because you can not give it less than that. This book should be under the fiction section as it contains nothing but that. I was in Iraq when the CPA built and occupied this site and during the build up to the attack. A lot of the problems that the author mentions were created by him and his poor leadership. He had numerous offers to locate his camp in a more secure location but chose not to. The fact is that it was the author who endangered peoples lives and the funny thing was that some of the people who saved the day are the ones that he keeps shooting down; i.e. KBR.Please do not buy this book as the author does not deserve to make any money or receive recognition of what he did, or in this case did not do, in Iraq."
1,Selfagrandizing Fiction - Don't Waste Your Time or Money,Most of this book is complete rubbish which does nothing to outline the situation in Iraq but seeks to bolster Mark Etherington's ego. In fact the very fact that he wrote this book making him look like some kind of hero speaks to his character and the character of the book. Etherington personally placed the security of the compound at Al Kut at risk when he disregarded security improvements recommended by the civilian security contractors. He further placed the personnel in the compound at risk by failing to evacuate the compound at the recommendation of the same security contractor.He had no plan to coordinate with III Corps to facilitate the mobilization of the QRF or any other support of that nature. He gave contradicting reports so that he could preserve the illusion that all was well in Al Kut refusing to evacuate the compound.Save your money - do not buy this book. This is one man's ego trip that in no way represents the truth.
1,Bad security and bad decisions,"I was on the site during the big battle in the book, when Etherington insisted on staying to negotiate with insurgents who weren't interested in negotiating but were buying time to dig in around us. In fact, they were looking for hostages, preferably American. The CPA compound was renovated at an expense of $20,000,000 but that did not include fortifications for the river bank because the governor liked the view of the river. When the compound was surrounded by hundreds of insurgents on April 6th, that exposed flank made it possible to shell the compound at will.I could go on but there's steam coming out of my ears right now and I shouldn't write under those conditions."
5,A great Film Noir,"Stranger on the Third Floor is the story Michael Ward, a key witness in a murder case who becomes embroiled in a dream like series of events which lead him to question his own sanity and nearly get him accused of one count of murder. The movie is relentless with its dark lightning and the presence of some strange characters helps drive home the environment of bleakness. It has a few twists and its well written. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of dark, psychological dramas."
1,Dull,Dull and poorly written. I am interested in military theory and I had to give up on this even though it was recommended by an expect in the field.
2,Very little overt argument,"Smith is a soldier, and as such, might have been better off writing reports and op orders than an overarching book of this nature. For someone whose experiences would, I presume, give him a lot to say, he has a lot of trouble saying it in this book. There really is no real strong thesis and he makes few overt arguments in favor of hi spoint. The book rambles, moves from vignette to vignette, and never gets to the point. Bottom line--avoid."
4,Impressed by Brandy Davis,"Like other reviewers have mentioned, I was very impressed by Brandy Davis in this show. Unlike most Surrender models cast from public auditions, she was not an empty headed doll with large hooters and a foreign accent. When she spoke, she had the charisma of a studio star like Charlize Theron or Heather Graham. Imdb posters all wonder where she went and what she does now. Maybe I'm biased since one dream scene has a line, ""Cindy, I'm home!"" that reminded me of a girl I had a crush on in high school. Otherwise, this movie is a very silly spoof of Star Trek featuring Spock and Khan-like characters, lazer battles, engine repair, etc."
2,Pleasurecraft pleasures a little,Not good acting. Some Sex scenes not too hot. Last one is best between Amber Newman and the captain. As he is having sex with her from behind her bare foot is touching his bare foot. He has pleasured reactions on his face while shs barely has none. 2 Stars.
3,what a peasurecruise,This was a great movie! If you love movie you'll love this great story.Nice womens and set!
4,Great for teachers!,"These are exactly the kinds of pithy quotes I want to stimulate students' thinking. Put a new one on the blackboard every day--the only problem is choosing which one to use. Quotes range from thought-provoking to inane, including an assortment of ""anonymous"" bumper-sticker or T-shirt quotes not usually included in a quotation book. I do wish Spencer had included documentation with the quotes. Even though I'd probably never look them up, I'd like to know where they came from. Even more, I wish he'd included a more thorough subject index. The quotes are alphabetical by author, but when I wanted references to ""algebra"" or ""history,"" the only way to find them all was to read every page. Maybe in the next edition?"
3,Does not work as good as B&D string.,Good price. Looks better than original string. For some reason it does not last as long as B&D string
5,Good string. Cheaper to rewind than to buy a reel.,The quality of this string may be better than OEM. It's a ton cheaper to rewind than buying a new reel.
2,Works OK until it falls apart,"I owned two of these downspout diverters for two years. They worked OK, but they don't allow as much water to pass through the bottom end as they allowed to enter the top. When it rains heavily water will leak out the top of the diverter and run down the side of your house. I patched mine up with foam sealant, but it was annoying. After two years these units took a beating from the sun and basically fell apart. The plastic in mine wasn't very thick and seemed to break down after being outside for a while -- hopefully they've modified the design. I've been using the RainReserve diverter units for a couple of months now, and I'm very impressed. Better plastic, MUCH stronger, and they have a hatch that can be removed to clean out the entire unit. The hoses are bigger too (and you can hook up two barrels to one diverter to fill them in parallel). Best of all, they don't suffer from the capacity issue that plagues this one. The extra $10 is worth it. Your mileage may vary."
4,Works,"Product works good as long as your not getting a extreme amount of rain, but I would still recommend this product."
3,Haven't used it yet,"The order information didn't let me choose between a unit that works with a 3"" or a 4"" downspout. The unit I received is for a 3"" downspout and I need to buy a converter unit to get it to work with my downspout. I bought a second unit from another supplier where I was able to designate my downspout's size. It works fine."
5,Not from Australia but still loving it!,"This was a killer cd! Grinspoon wasn't even heard of here until I bumped into their webpage last year...now they're ALL i listen too!!! They're wicked awesome and i think they seriously need to think about coming on tour to the US! So...if u just happen to be from the USA and have never heard of Grinspoon and like that punky hardcore type of music...buy the cd, it KiKs!"
4,A photographic guide to Ford.,"This edition has larger photos than the edition titled ""90 years of Ford"" also published by the same publisher.There are fewer pages here and fewer photos. but its still a great reference book with plenty of captions throughout.An ideal book if you can find a copy."
3,Sturdy but has its problems.,"Must agree this is a very sturdy little mount, but that pivot arm is just too stiff. Feels like I would yank the TV off the attachment bracket soon. Kind of lame they only include 4 screws for attaching the TV(6 mount points) and those plastic spacers are way too cheesy. If you have a LG DU-42PX12X TV I would suggest a trip to the hardware store.Now since this mount is for large screens you could expect the wall bracket to spawn more then one stud section. I can see some folks want a tiny mount, but in my case I could care less(recessed into a cabinet). I wanted to have my TV mounted center on one stud, so I ended up first mounting a 1"" solid wood plank across 3 studs and then attaching the mount to that."
5,This Is Cool,"I really like Janis Carnes' voice. I love her versions of ""Georgia On My Mind"" and ""Skylark"". My other favorites are ""Am I Naive"" and ""Irresistible""."
1,Lower than a One Star...,"You can safely ignore the longer review from the four star reviewer - HE IS THE DIRECTOR of this train wreck and obviously has a financial stake in getting you to watch this. If you are wavering, trying to decide if you will rent this, DON'T. It is shot terribly - horrible angles, terrible lighting, just...atrocious. The dialog and script, plot and pacing - all abysmal. The acting is beyond bad and well and truly into the realm of unwatchable. Even for C-horror (the relatively new genre of shot-on-video-no budget-""backyard"" productions that are so prevalent in this age of inexpensive video filmmaking), this one is a waste of time in every aspect. You can very safely ignore the four star rating one review chose to bestow on this. You can also safely ignore the somewhat catchy DVD artwork, which admittedly suckered me in. Just do yourself a giant favor and keep looking - there are many good C-horror movies out there (if you enjoy C-horror). This, as they say, ain't it."
2,"A bargain when they work, but they don't always work","I have ordered these CD-R's twice. The first lot I received all ten discs worked great producing perfect digital recordings in my Philips CD recorder. More recently, I received a second lot and every disc was defective and not recognized as an audio CD by the Philips recorder. Beware of bad lots!"
1,too inconsistent to buy,"The problem with these CDs is that you never know when you're going to get a batch that will fail you altogether, or half way through your recording project. The great thing about CDs over analog is the consistency and clarity of sound. You have no guarantee of either when you buy these. Better to pay a little more for something reliable."
1,Avoid this brand!,"I have a 20 pack of these, and niether of my recordable drives will accept them. I got one to burn, but all of the rest have been rejected at every attempt. Save yourself the trouble and look for another brand."
5,If you Liked Second Sight..,"You will love Bass Desires by the same group. It is their first album and, I believe, much superior."
3,Product labeled misleadingly.,"Product was labeled as new, but there are spots of missing color on the cover art and other damage along the edges. Since it was pretty cheap I'll just keep it but it shouldn't have been labeled as new."
5,gift,this will be a christmas gift. it looks great (has not been opened yet). this will be great with his art supplie. fast shippment too.
5,A Hidden Treasure,"My seven-year-old daughter and I read together almost every night. In the past two years, no book (besides the Old Testament) has been her selection more than When the Whippoorwill Calls. The Blue Ridge family it depicts finds out the federal government is buying up their mountain to make way for the Blue Ridge Parkway. In the process, the seven-year-old protagonist learns a lesson of hope from the example of her father, who struggles with, but in the end adapts to, their move to the flatlands. The beauty of the story, though, is in its language. Like the mountain people she writes about, Ms. Ransom has a gift for expressing complicated sentiment in simple and concrete ways. After a number of readings, it dawned on me that I was reading good poetry. I should mention that the lllustrations are lovely and the layout of the pages is attractive and interesting."
4,I haven't read much of this yet...,"I am a writer, and I'm always looking for ideas for my fictional novels. This looks to be a very good book to draw ideas from."
3,Big Sky Ghosts,"Tracy GarciaAnnotated Bibliography11/5/03Big Sky Ghosts, Debra D. Munn, Pruett Publishing Company, 1993I though that this was a good book for any one especially if you live in Montana. It has stories told by real people and facts to prove them. Debra gathered her information by interviewing people about the spooky happenings. The book tells about ghosts from all over Montana, places such as Bannack, Carroll College, and Missoula. Overall it was a great book.Indian Creek Chronicles, Pete Fromm, Lyons & Burford, Publishers, 1993This was a great piece of Montana literature. It shows what Montana is really like, the harsh weather, that it's not all nice weather and beautiful mountains. The book tells about a man that survives seven months in a little canvas tent. The best part, he doesn't know what the heck he's doing. But all-in-all a good book."
5,EXCELLENT book!,"There are two books titled BIG SKY GHOSTS: Volume 1 and volume 2.This review is for Volume 2.I am still trying to locate and purchase Volume 1.This is an excellent book!Included are the TRUE hauntings of the Chico Hot Springs Lodge in Pray, Montana by Percie Knowles,haunted Virginia City, The ghost of Clore Street,Ghostly Garnet, Montana's Haunted Mines, The tragedy of Big Hole Battlefield, the haunting of the Montana State University Theater, Hannah Flagg-- the ghost of Niarada, assorted haunted houses of Helena, Montana ghost lights, more haunted theaters (included is the Fort Peck Theatre), plus much more.There are several excellent old black and white photos- particularly interesting is the picture of Percie Knowles on page 111!Highly recommended!Debra Munn also wrote another excellent book: Ghosts On The Range: Eerie True Tales Of Wyoming."
1,Defective - poor quality,Steren balun I rec'd was defective - resulted in an 80% signal loss from antenna. Replaced with balun from Radio Shack and channels lighted up.
1,"Poor quality, broke within 5 minutes of receiving",This item sucked. I inadvertently pulled the 300 ohm wires out of the transformer about 2 minutes after opening the package. I wasn't even rough with it. Poor quality and durability. I can only imagine how well this would've held up attached to my antenna in the storms we have here (60 mph gusts common). Went to a brick and mortar and bought one for a little more that was way better quality and much better durability.
5,Great Game!,Love music and the 80's ... This game has given me a lot of fun moments with friends even though they are not as knowledgeable as I am...
2,Too dry and dull,"You can use this book to introduce Thanksgiving to kids, but I'm sure there must be better ones. Kids need a good story to engage them, but this book reads too much like an encyclopedia entry (""Families and friends gather together for a feast. Many tables are filled with the same foods the Pilgrims and Indians shared."")The illustrations are colorful, but flat.Neither of my kids would sit still for this book."
2,Not as good as '1001 Rabbit Tales' or 'Daffy Duck's Quackbusters',"This is really a mess of classics stitched together. I like the WB compilation of classic cartoons stitched together with new animation, like the 1988 'Daffy Duck's Quackbusters', the 1982 '1001 Rabbit Tales', the 1983 'Daffy Duck's Movie: Fantastic Island', ect. There are a lot I'm forgetting I'm sure. Anyway this one is just a mess with the direction they take with the new story line with old episodes. The new animation that was made for this is of poor quality and the voices don't match up, i.e. Porky Pig sounds like Bugs Bunny.This could have been one of their first compilations so it wasn't as good as what came after it I suppose. A shame, I'd love to watch this in October but I'd rather just watch the unedited shorts from the 'Looney Tunes Golden Collection'. The new animation and story does not add to the enjoyment of the original shorts."
5,GREAT!,I remember watching the special when I was younger. My mom even recorded it for me on an old tape. I was very happy that this was on dvd and I just HAD to have it for old time you know.I watched it and I still laugh! It's a great buy and arrived when it was supposed to. Not one complaint.A must see for the younger generations!
4,There's a little trick with this Halloween treat!,"If you are a person of a certain age, you grew up watching these cartoons, and loved every minute of it. The best part was, your parents could watch them right along with you, because there was a great deal of sophistication to the humor.Finding the ""Howl-OWeen Special"" was the treat. Seeing how it was put together was definitely the trick. The editing seems patchwork and amateur. At some points, the matching to link the scenes was apalling.However, for a younger child who has never had the joy of seeing the originals, this is quite passable. For the adults in the room, the flaws cannot be missed. If you can steel yourself to overlook the flaws, it's still our favorite old cartoons!"
3,"Spliced scenes from old cartoons, but cute","I was disappointed to find out that this was not a new Halloween cartoon, it is just a spliced-together compilation of other old Bugs Bunny cartoons. Still, they are all classics, so I guess it's okay. I don't know why I was expecting to see something I'd never seen before. Among the cartoons are two of the funniest ever: the big read furry monster, and the one in which Porky Pig and Sylvester go to that haunted hotel. There is also the Jekyll & Hyde episode in which Tweety becomes a big yellow monster. So, yeah, it was fun to watch, but we kept hoping for something new. I know we'll probably watch this every Halloween, so I'm still glad I bought it."
3,Classic,Although this is just some of the cartoons spliced together for this special and it does have a chopped look in places... it is still worth watching.
3,"Decent, some bad editing",This special is better than some of the Bugs Bunny holiday specials. The editing is a bit sloppy in parts of it. There is something of a story in this special without having to entirely rely on the old clips. I would still like to see this released on DVD some day. I just hope that they load up the DVD with addiitonal cartoons and featurettes.
1,Awful,"This was just horrible. I thought we were getting the original movies. What we got was a mish/mash of bad editing and voices that don't belong to the characters. Even our 10 year old, who didn't have the good fortune of seeing the originals, said ""why did Porkey's voice just change for that one sentence""? I will keep looking until I find the original movies in full."
3,"Too short, not complete!","I agree with the first reviewer! There are several other ""Halloween"" theme WB cartoons I would have loved on this DVD. All the Witch Hazel and anything scary would have completed the DVD. I think it was still worth the purchase though."
2,Who hacked up the cartoons??,"I really want to know what happened to the ORIGINAL version I saw when I was child, on television???? This has SOME of the bits and pieces, but in my opinion, has been poorly 'sewn' together into a mockery of the first TV Special. Am I the only one who can tell where the cartoon has been pieced together due to poor colour matching and voices? I am disappointed, as I had hoped I found THE original cartoon I so loved when I was young."
1,Not what you think,"This might be great if you have young kids who aren't very familiar with the classic bugs bunny cartoons. This ""special"" attempts to link 3 or 4 (I can't remember now) old cartoons together with a very weak premise. Bluntly, its awful. The segments are hacked together and in some parts redubbed. The only saving grace is original voices. But its just not anything a true looney tunes fan would want to see. Now that I've seen it, I will avoid it at all costs. What I would truly love, is a collection of those great old 'halloween' shorts. Mad Scientist, Witch Hazel, Count Bloodcount, etc etc. If this is what you would like too--I suggest you continue to wait along with me. Don't waste your time/money on this."
1,Really disappointed...,"I was so excited to get this video to share with my little one and MAN was I disappointed. I'm going to try to get my money back. They took bits from every bugs bunny cartoon and spliced it together to make one big movie. In one scene Witch Hazel is Green, it pans to Bugs Bunny and in the very next scene She's WHITE! HUH???? This isn't the cartoon I remember and I wish I would have read ALL the reviews before making my purchase. I paid $10 for it and I'll most likely sell it in a garage sale for .50 cents. What a bummer...."
4,Sotto Voce,I was glad to receive my product although the box was not sealed. I hope it was new.Thanks
4,"Short, concise, useful introduction to a neglected subject","I bought this book a long time ago early in my career when I was first exposed to affluent business trips and executive-level meetings. Coming from a very middle-class background, I did not grow up with the training and experience that many upper-class people get by virtue of their lifestyles. I had no clue about table manners, tipping, and courtesies with high-level executives.Ms. Sabath may not be the final word on business etiquette, but her advice has worked well for me over the years. This book is short and sweet, and you can reread it on the airplane to ensure that you make a good impression at that important social or business occasion. I am a happy customer."
5,No Better Value,"I purchased these from AAFES while deployed to Afghanistan for $14.99. Needless to say I wasn't expecting much at all, but I wanted a pair of over-the-ear headphones for watching movies, and for the price I could stand to be disappointed. I can't say for sure what I was expecting by buying these--for $15 it's hard to get your hopes up--but I certainly wasn't expecting to be as blown away as I have been. Even prior to the burn-in they sounded fantastic, and they've only gotten better with time. When I returned stateside, I compared them to a pair of Bose headphones I had around the house and I couldn't identify an appreciable difference. Will they be creamed by a $250 set? Of course, but for the money it's hard to go wrong with these."
3,nice but small annoying deficiency noted,"The watch is nice HOWEVER my item contains a small deficiency that is inability to adjust one of the chronograph dials' hand precisely to zero position, as prescribed by the user manual (although the deviation is only very sligtly noticeable). This deficiency surfaced before I started wearing the watch and just started setting it up upon the delivery. This is quite irritating and my conclusion from this experience is to buy only well established Swiss brands known for their top quality in the future, like I did in the past before experimenting with this Invicta item."
4,a marilyn fan necessity,"Whether you believe that Marilyn herself or friend Ben Hecht wrote this book, it is a must-own for any collector. With short, charming chapters that you can almost hear being whispered to you in Marilyn's little girl voice, the book truly captures her persona. How awful to get to the end, knowing her troubles are barely beginning!"
1,HOAX!,"This bbok was published several years ago and I made the mistake of buying several copies to give to friends. Needless to say, I believe MM DID NOT write a single word of this drivel. Just rotten. Don't waste your time or money. I have collected and even met Monroe as a child of five in an elevator in NYC. That was in 1955. My collection amasses over 7000 pieces including over 45 books, this is amongst the worst.Folks this ain't the REAL thang!"
3,special only because she wrote it!,"this book is unique for the reason that it is marilyn monroe's story, told as she herself wanted it to be told. (there is no mistaking that because she wrote it.) but at the same time, it is unfinished, and really cuts off before she gets to ""the good stuff"". you are left with an unquenchable desire to know the whole story. if you love m.m., then i sidgest adding this to your collection, if you are not that die hard of a fan, then you may pass this one up with out a second thought!"
3,Marliyn doesnt need your pitty,"The book is very good as it was written by the woman her self. what weird are all of the comments being made tawords her in the intro.though she may have had a ""sad life"" she lived an awsome one. not only that but i can relate to her as a person. she was a classy lady, she only wrote what she felt was enough for you to know. she gives you only two pages per chapter which i think is clever. you also get to see her humor.and for you aspiring actersses out there, she gives tips!I must say I feel very conforted as she went through the same tings i went through as an actress on her way to the top and was able to finally have success money and things more her way.She is very respected for a reason and is truely missed by manymuch love <3"
1,MEXICAN-ENGLISH CONSTRUCTION DICTIONARY,"This translation guide works for American contractors with illegal Mexican workers. It`s far from having proper Spanish construction and engineering terminology, and when I refer Spanish, I mean international Spanish, not just from the Peninsula. Many of the Spanishtranslations are inaccurate and many are just funny Americanisms. It is a very limited guide, and could probably be used in California and Texas by a few little, not by the rest of the world, not to say Latin America."
1,DEWALT SPANISH/ENGLISH CONSTRUCTION DICTIONARY,"It does not have a single word related to the steel industry, like pre-engineered steel buildings, and words we use every day, like solid I-Beam construction, PBR panels, purlins, Z-girts, purlins, and many others translate into Spanish,so it was o no use to me."
1,avoid this product,"The tape doesn't feed properly, the letters are unclear, and the action of the lever is poor. This item would be a rip-off at $4.98. Find something else."
4,nice label maker but alignment issue,"this is not a bad label maker, the emboss looks very professional. THe only issue is that sometimes the letters don't align with the height of the label, so youll see some letters too high and the next too low. it doesn't do that all the time i noticed it happens during the early stages of a new roll or when you twist the letter wheel the other way"
4,tape,"so far i like it, but hard to find the 1/2"" tape for it.maybe some one could help me on that ?thank you"
4,a man from my state ( Washington ),"I remember Jimmie Rodgers from years ago but forgot what a good voice he had. Enjoyed all of the songs. The only thing bad about it was him holding the cigarette on the cover--but, I guess, in those days, it was better accepted. All in all it is a great performance by a very talented singer of songs."
3,1500 lb Winch,I received the 1500 lb winch but it was not the one shown in the picture. I was offered to send it back but there was no word if they had the proper one so I am going to keep the one sent. I am disappointed.Steve.
2,Winch,Small and not very heavy duty. Kept existing winch and just replaced the frayed cable with a strap. Only good for tiny applications.
1,How to use InDesign where Photoshop will do,"I dislike giving any book a negative review but this book is really misleading in subject matter. It should be titled along the lines of: How to use InDesign where Photoshop will do the job as well if not better. The vast bulk of the book is taken up with producing artefacts (buttons, icons, text, etc) that are much more commonly fabricated in Photoshop. In the Introduction the author states that he has ""always been a Photoshop guy"". Ok I can live with that, but then he adds further down that ""the book does not contain any page-size projects such as sample brochures or mock advertisements"". Sorry, I can't live with this. I bought the book because I assumed that it would help me do layout with text and artwork for just these kind of jobs. If your needs are similar to mine (learning InDesign rather than QuarkXpress), this is almost certainly not the book of first choice."
5,Great shirt,"great T-shirt. It is a 'fitted' t shirt, so I order a size larger than normal to get the fit I want. At this price, for organic cotton, it is a great deal. Good quality and weight."
4,great T!,"a low cost, high quality T that has stood up to abuse and many washings, it's also not produced with 10 or 12 lbs of insecticides- what's not to like? they run slightly shorter in the body length than other T's, so if you like them long, this may not be the shirt for you."
3,It's ok,"This book covers a lot, and it's ok, but I disagree with the review comparing it with McKee. True to the premise of the series, the essentials are covered. There are some interesting points made too. However, if you opt to buy a bigger, better, course in screenwriting, you won't be spending much more to get it, and you won't be missing anything by not having this book."
5,Perfect!,"Easy to use and great color! My daughter's art teacher recommend it to me, and I just found that it is the best among all I have bought for my daughter. Also, if it stains on clothes, it's very easy to wash."
4,Good paint but cap broke,"Good paint: good consistency and opacity. Nice to have such a big bottle of white (especially since sets of paint so seldom come with white). It does smell a bit odd, but not strongly so, and it's not really that unpleasant.My only beef is that the cap broke (I don't think it broke in shipping; I think I broke it carrying it in my bag), so I can't store the bottle on its side in my daughter's crafts box. I'd complain, but really the flip top is super convenient for being able to quickly dole out more."
4,NOT fluroescent,"I'm not sure of the actual quality of this paint. I was looking for something to use during my Halloween party under the blacklight, and I mistakenly figured that all white paint would glow. (whoever heard of ""fluorescent white""? If you're looking to purchase it for a similar reason, save yourself the time, money, and trouble. Otherwise, paint on!"
3,a little small,"Hey All, this is your very basic black shift ball. I ordered it based on cost and ""basic-ness"" seemed to fit the bill and it is a Hurst (not that it matters. I guess i give it a three because it is pretty small and just looks weird on my shifter. No where on this site or on the manufactures site did it state that it is approximately an inch and a half in diameter. Nor does it have any logo engraved as the description says. I dont know, car i bought has a kind of ugly billet shift knob on it but i dont think i can use this, probably end up missing the shifter half the time."
3,Not good on Kindle,"Maybe this is obvious to most but I thought I'd give it a try.This book doesn't work on the Kindle.You can't see the tables/figures, etc. There is no CD (of course) and it's not really ""studiable"". I haven't taken the test yet so can't speak to it's being detailed or specific enough. It seems other reviewers have already done a good job of that.Just DON'T buy the Kindle version."
2,"Outdated, no longer sufficient.","This was a good book in its day... for the previous version (5) of the test. But it's outdated and needs an update. This version of the book won't prepare you for the test. Version 6 was released in 2008 with lots more modules and newer malware and hacking tools. Example, there are no sections on wireless or bluetooth hacking, and no info on Cisco PIX firewall models and their specs. (Unfortunately, books that cover the new CEH v6 exam seem to be lacking at the moment.)"
4,Great Ethical Hacking and Study Resource,I think Michael Gregg did a fantastic job at taking everything that is in the CEH exam and presenting it in a logical and easy to read format. I personally enjoyed reading the book and recommend reading this book not only for the exam but also to learn more about ethical hacking and the tools used in our profession. I owe a big portion of my CEH certification to Michael Gregg and this book. Regardless if you have no experience or years of experience this book will provide you the knowledge to pass the CEH and further your knowledge or help you start a new career. Job well done!
4,Good Book,"This is a good book, but you need to have the official courseware because dont cover all topics deeply."
5,Stray Cats Alive,"This Japanese release contains most, if not all, of the Stray Cats' smokin' video releases, from Stray Cat Strut through their 1989 reunion album with Gina, Gene & Eddie, etc. These are well worth having and probably familiar to most Cat fans. The video quality and sound are excellent; however, beware, the packaging is CD sized!Most of these great numbers were on the earlier EMI video release, but it's great to have them on CD. For some reason I don't understand, the Stray Cats are out of 'vogue' today so don't expect an American release of these songs anytime soon... However, Brian and Co. have recently reunited for a European Tour with a new Tour DVD due out in November. It would be great if there was a Stray Cats revival; these guys deserve it!If you can afford this Best of collection, it's well worth having. No telling with EMI how long it will be before there's an American release of this video treasure."
1,improper title,"This is not Season 3 of Teen Mom. It is officially listed on MTV, the network that broadcasts this show as ""Teen Mom 2"". Also, what is listed as ""Teen Mom: Season 4"" is actually season 3. Hopefully a correction can be made."
5,Disturbing but VERY necessary,This is a terrifying book - a must read for any parent or teacher of children of any age but especially those who are pre-teens. Sax has done a real service to anyone who cares about children and their futures.
5,Long overdue,"The book is outstanding, and long overdue. While I fully support equality of the sexes, it's very important to more fully understand the differences between boys and girls, and how those differences might impact learning and teaching. This book speaks to my personal experiences and I discuss it widely, and have given it as a gift to many people. It's an important topic and one that every parent, educator, and concerned citizen should read. 5 stars all the way!"
5,Dr. Sax is Right On,"Wow. What a page turner.I'm sixty years old now and my only daughter is grown with two of her own children - a boy and a girl. I'm happy to say she turned out great but I still wish I'd had this book when I was raising her. I hope that she will read it and apply its teachings to the raising of her children. It's a more complicated world out there now and parents need all the help they can get.I'm almost in total agreement with Dr. Sax on how things have changed over the last 40 years. I've seen a lot of young men and women fresh out of high school in my 18 years as a community college instructor and even in that time span I've seen many changes. And I'm sorry to say the changes I have seen have been for the worse, probably due to the reasons Dr. Sax explains in this book.Parents, take heed. Read this book and pay attention before it's too late."
5,Superb reading!,I've been a teacher for 20 years and have not found an author more convincing or knowledgable than Leonard Sax. It would help parents and teachers do a better job in training young people of all ages.
1,"Please, do more research than this book","A lot of the research that Dr. Sax is quoting is seriously generalized. There is very little research that has been done on children's brains, so many of the claims he is making about boys and girls is actually based on research done on adult men and women. some of his claims are even based on research done on rats. He obviously has to cite all these claims, so it's easy to look up for yourself. Be wary of his advice."
4,Fascinating read,"This should be required reading for all parents and teachers. The brain research is fascinating and the societal commentary seems accurate, if disturbing."
4,Five Stars actually,"I too found the first half of the book fascinating and learned something new every couple of pages. Around the middle of the book when he talks about discipline things bog down - it's more anecdotal and opinionated and less scientifically based. The last few chapters again piqued my interest. Interesting statistics and nuggets of information are studded throughout the book and it is well worth reading for anyone interested in how best to educate children to become productive adults.Some reviewers disagreed with Sax's assertion that all children are ""gifted"" but I think he uses that term to mean that all children have some talent or ability or interest which can be developed into a ""gift"" with appropriate teaching. His book explores how best to do this, backed up by scientific evidence based on recent advances in brain imaging. I also recommend BOYS ADRIFT."
2,There is some strange advice in this book.,"This book has some interesting data on sex differences in the brain and some good practical advice for dealing with these differences in the context of schooling and raising children. But toward the end of the book, the evidence supporting Sax's advice shifts to the anecdotal and the advice gets weird. For example, regarding discipline, Sax advocates limiting the amount a 4-month-old may nurse in order to teach it the valuable lesson of ""who's boss."" This advice shows a lack of understading the importance of nursing on demand to insure adequate milk supply for an infant. Also, Sax advocates spanking boys, but not girls -- try explaining that one to your kids."
3,A cautionary note regarding his opinions on disciplining babies,"Overall this is an interesting book. He has many practical suggestions and it will definately influence the way in which I view my children's development. I also appreciate how seriously he takes youngsters social lives!One section of the book concerned me. In a section on discipline he refers to discipline beginning in the nursery and he recommends limiting the amount of time a breastfed baby nurses. His information about how breastfeeding works is wrong, and the restricted nursing that he recommends can lead to an insufficient milk supply. This is only a small detail in the book, but it is a good reminder that although his introduction focuses on how he alone of all authors on gender will focus on what the science really says, he does go beyond what science says and throw in his own opinions too."
1,Pseudoscience,"The book is a mess of gender stereotypes that are not scientifically substantiated regardless of the impressive number of footnotes. Try reading neuroscientist Lise Eliot's Pink Brain, Blue Brain instead if you're looking for scientifically validated but highly readable information.Pink Brain, Blue Brain: How Small Differences Grow Into Troublesome Gaps -- And What We Can Do About ItAlso Cordelia Fine's Delusions of Gender.Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference"
5,A must read for anybody that deals with kids.,"My aunts told my mom she needed to read this books called ""Gender Matters."" I ordered it for her right away and started reading it soon as we got it. GREAT book! My mom loves it too. The author is not pushing any political agenda but simply writes about his observations on his research, the research of others in his field and what he saw in observing real families and children. The book is written in a way anybody can understand, keeping confusing scientific jargon to a minimum.I highly recommend this book to my fellow young women who hope to have kids some day."
5,Great,"Nice pull, perfect condition, fast shipping, included hardware easy to install, easy to clean...If you like the looks, get it. If installing on a drawer, you might need some longer screws."
2,In need of a dictionary and political reality,"Perhaps an interesting autobiographical outing if one is interested in the otherwise non-celebrated author. Ms Yuknavitch seems to invent political perspectives to associate something other than simple auto-bio to her stories.She should also be advised that her dictionary definition of the Greek word ""clitoris"", which acts as a prologue to her story ""LUST"" is in fact incorrect and not verifiable in any Greek or English dictionary. Rather than the ""small hill"" that Yuknavitch presumes the definition to be, ALL other sources relate the word to locks and closures. The word, when correctly translated, can undoubtably be recognized as the genesis of the French words cle and clef."
3,Beware,"These cd's have recorded ok for me, but the only negative thing about them is that they do not play in car cd players! That's the only reason I bought them! So if you're looking to record cds for your vehicle, then don't buy these."
1,90% chance of error,"Very bad quality, out of 10 CD, only one works fine. We never have problem with HP burner 4X and verbatim CD-R before, but this CD will stop recording at the middle of the process and you cannot use it again."
4,Short but thorough,"This is a solid work on Relax NG. The text is very thorough and the author obviously knows what he is talking about. On it's face that makes this a must have book for NG users.It's not without it's flaws however. The graphics are poor and there could be more done to impart how the Relax NG specifications relate to the specific XML examples they are validating. In addition the book provides little information about tools and support for NG, and also neglects to relate NG to any of the other XML validation standards (DTD, XML Schema.)For a book about a tough subject it does a lot in a small space. For someone looking for information about NG who is going to apply it in the near term this is a fine work."
2,Falling short comparing with Perry,"I have been working i the chemical industry for 18 years. I have found 1 advantage for this book compared with ""Perry's Chemicals ... handbook 6 edition"", the price. I have benn reading some chapter very thoroughly, i was very dissapointed. Crystallisation, fluidisation, centrifugal separations. In every aspect Perry was better. I have breafly been reading and comparing some other chapters and the result is the same.Coulson seems to me to be old, made by people that have not been out working in the factory the last 50 years. The text is also filled with information for filling the pages ( an american sicknes compared wit europe), to a higher degree."
4,Great tempra paint.,"This tempra paint is the perfect consistency and truly is washable. And, apparently it doesn't taste too great (which is nice considering my daughter loves to attempt to eat paint)."
1,Absolutely nothing new,"Why do books like this keep coming out where they promise ""new"" and ""breakthrough"" ideas, when they're just reformulations of the same old stuff? This book is just a renaming of the tried and true concepts brought about by Fisher and Ury years ago. There's absolutely nothing ""new"" here at all. I agree with one of the other comments: ""Expand the Pie"" or ""Getting to Yes"" are better bets. Stick with what already works. Like the man said, if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
3,A new genre is born,"I suppose ""mystery fluff"" will be an accurate representation of this new and unique style:There is a mystery out there, somebody is very plausibly accused of crime, however it is also possible that he (or she) may not committed it.However, the book mostly tells us about how the prosecutor pivoted, how the judge smiled, and what kind of pizza was ordered for dinner. Nothing of significance is happening for the most of the book, but by the end of it we will know the answer and it is not necessary the expected one.And despite of all of this, this fluff does not annoy you a bit, once you read one book you want to start another one."
2,Passable tale with lectures in between from a defense attorney,"The writing? Alright. The story? Not many twists and turns. How I found it? In a free Reader's Digest digest. How I felt about the characters? I'll be the writer's a social conservative.And no, it's no Pelican Brief, not that that's gonna be a classic anytime soon. And way too many self-justifying lectures about defense work."
3,Good for the price,The string is very delicate that it hangs on. It has broken a few times but i tie it back up But i've had it for months and its still hanging. It only breaks cause i've caught it a few times when cleaning my windshield.
3,Ok if you are beginner,"This books is long, and you must read every single line if you want to catch the ideas. The ideas take a long time to perform, so you are better off starting with PPC before trying anything in this book. Personally, I prefer Robin Nobles book on Website traffic."
5,Papers won't fall out,"These pocket folders are great for keeping your papers clean, together and protected, especially if you need to take files out in the field. Although Smead makes file pockets like these with expandable sides, the legal sized flat pockets will easily hold over a half-inch stack of letter sized documents or about half that in legal sized ones. Because the sides don't expand, these file pockets are great at keeping your papers from falling out."
5,great paint!,Bought these for my two year old to paint! It's very easy to make this stuff go a long way! It's a lot better than wasting money on small tubes! The colors are consistent and thick but smooth.
5,This deck is great for reflecting multiple cultures,"This deck is great. As an African American reader, I am often turned off by most decks because they don't reflect a realistic world population. This deck offers Egyptians in a variety of colors as the major arcana. The wands are Africans that seem to be from the Serengheti, the coins are East indians, the cups are Mayan or Central Americans, and the Swords are I believe the Nordic tribes of Europe. The images are also closely aligned with the meanings given in the Crowley deck. The Hebrew letters as well as the elements so those that are deeper into the mysteries of pathwork will feel at home. I only wish there was more information available from the author of this deck. I have been using this deck for 12 years and have bought it at least 3-4 times because of so much use."
3,A politcally correct tarot.,"""Tarot of the Ages"" has everything you could want in a deck: nice, small cards for ease of shuffling; the four suits divided up into mostly brown-skinned cultures (Central Africans, Mayan Aztecs, peoples of India and the Nordic Vikings), all of whom run around in various states of undress; there's even a fat chick and a pregnant chick! What more could you want?Many of the people pictured on the cards seem stoic to the point of expressionless. The descriptions in the booklet are a bit out there even for a tarot deck. I wish I could have gotten more of a feel from this tarot, because seeing people who look like me in a deck is really refreshing.It is not a great learning deck, but probably has a lot of potential once I have more a of a clue."
5,The Best,"I've have been using this deck for 6 years, it goes everywhere with me, and has never given me anything that didn't make sense. The understanding of symbols within the deck is consise, and to the point."
5,The Best,"I' have been using this deck for 6 years, it goes everywhere with me, and has never given me anything that didn't make sense. The understanding of symbols within the deck is consise, and to the point."
4,Almost perfect..,"Excellent art and print..one of my favorite decks..my only criticism is the small size(5,5 x 110)..I prefer the tradicional size of most standard decks of Usgames and Systems:-70 X 120..I'm sure the deck would be even nicer if it were a little bigger..So,I take a star because of this detail.-****-4 STARS."
1,Not so good,After my granddaughter opened this item it looked cheap and cheesy. She too was disappointed. This is something I would not buy again.
4,Roller fairlead,"I primarily use the winch for raising and lowering my snow plow. I like the idea of the extra large roller, it should be easier on my cable. Will see if it holds up when the snow flies."
3,just an observation...,"No doubt the set looks beautiful. But according to things I've read and true fans of the japanese culture would probably not buy this. A reviewer state that dafter Washing their set the paint started to fall away. I've watched enough documentaries on the japanese crafts to know at least that what they make is thoroughly meant to last. Next is what I noticed on the picture. If this was an authentic set or a true attempt, then there would be three or five cups, not four. Japanese are very superstitious. And the word for four in japanese is also death. Sorta like we in America avoid 13.I'm not saying don't buy this, I'm just pointing out it's probably not authentic."
3,it was ok,"The set was smaller than I expected but pretty, the quality may not be as high as I expected for the price."
4,Dragonball Season 5,It is good to complete the saga. But you will probably only watch it once or twice. So buy it cheap or rent it.
5,Dragon ball season 5,Its funny and thrilling in all the dragonballsDragon Ball: Season TwoDragon Ball: Season ThreeDragon Ball: Season OneDragon Ball: Season Four
1,DISGUSTING CHOCOLATE!!!,You would think that with a name like Jelly Belly behind them who would question if they used a great tasting chocolate to cover the nuts. Well I had given out pounds of it because they are so disgusting and everyone I pawned them off on agreed. What a waste of big Macadamia nuts!!!
3,Good Family Movie,"This is a really good movie to teach a lesson about the love of money. The main character is obsessed with making money and it frequently infringes on her other goals. In an accident she is ""transported"" back in time and takes the place of a member of her family just before Black Tuesday. When in that time, she sees how her grandfather, in his pursuit of the dollar will cost the family the farm where they live. She tries to persuade him differently, then begins to raise money herself to try and keep him from selling the land. This movie is very good, and watchable for the whole family. Along with being entertaining, it has a very deffinite moral."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!,"THIS MOVIE WAS SO GOOD!! IT'S ABOUT THIS YOUNG GIRL AND ALL SHE CARES ABOUT IS MONEY AND SHE GOES BACK IN TIME AND LEARNS THAT THERE IS MORE TO LIFE THAN MONEY AND THAT YOU CAN BE RICH WITH OTHER THINGS, TOO. IT IS SO GOOD!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!"
5,Feture Films For Families Classic,A great now and then film for adults and children alike. You can trust FFFF films to be of good moral value. A must film for all homes where you want to teach good moral values.
2,How to see Fairies,"Wasn't what I expected, compared to his owl books. I was disappointed in this book & it's content.Don't think I'd buy more."
2,WELCOME TO HOLLYWOOD,"This book was an entertaining read at first. After a few chapters it started to dawn on me that Mr Weinberger truly felt that Hollywood owed him because he had an MBA (a fact that he reminds the reader of at any given opportunity). I live in Hollywood and have not climbed the ranks yet either, but at least I am giving it more than a year. Mr Weinberger came off as a whiny, immature spoilt brat. Perhaps he is better off in investment banking. My only hope is that this does not become a movie."
4,Hilarious,"I like a lot of mere mortals entertained ideas of 'going to Hollywood' and reading scripts and moving and shaking deals. However, after 3 chapters of this book all this changed.Although the author had a bad experience, well actually, a lot of them, I was nevertheless glad that it wasn't me. I've read over and over that unless your relatives work in this industry you have a snowballs chance to make it there - no matter how good your qualifications.A quick and entertaining read with a lot of black humor. Future wannabes will be enlightened."
2,business skills don't translate to Hollywood skills,"If you are looking for Hollywood insight then ""Hello, He Lied"" by Lynda Obst is far better. ""Wannabe"" is a story about living in the trenches as someone just starting out in Hollywood. The stories are not hilarious or cutting edge in any way; rather they are the mundane ups and downs of possible opportunities. One of the major stories is an interview to be Alec Baldwin's assistant. Yes, the interview is the major part of the story. All the while the author (in my opinion) is looking at the book as the way to get back into Hollywood. (An early part of the book describes how the scene would look in camera angles and at the end there is a gleeful note that the book has been optioned as a screenplay.) Overall, the author does not understand the byzantine rules by which Hollywood operates and I didn't gain much insight from his book either."
4,Fun book to read,"This is a very fun book to read. Mr. Weinberger may not know this, but some of those temp types aren't exclusive to Hollywood. You can find these in many executive offices throughout corporate America. I like his style of writing, too. It doesn't seem like a tell-all book to me. I took it merely as his experiences trying to break into the film industry. I would love to see it made into a movie."
2,Section on regulation very disappointing,"I bought this book because I recently joined the in-house legal department of a telecom company and wanted to know more about telecom regulation. I saw the book in a bookstore and, seeing that it had about 150 pages on regulation, ordered it through amazon later. Big mistake. The regulation section is a series of almost completely random articles on the subject of regulation - whatever they could get a contributor to write about, I guess. I wanted a structured intro into US telecom regulation. While there is some coverage it is not presented as a guide and there is a lot of utterly useless stuff - for an example, a discussion of the Gambian experience in deregulation (I wish I was making this up..). I had planned to read the rest of the book for general industry reference, but assuming it is of similar quality, it is hard for me to work up the energy to do so."
3,"Great looking watch, but loses too much time",Easy to read. Attractive style. I purchased 1 of these & it lost 6-7 seconds per day. Returned it. A month later I purchased another one to see if it kept better time. It lost at least 6 seconds per day. Returned it too.
1,Not an audio CD,"Got something called UMD or something...bottom line, my cd player won't play it. Doesn't matter than I can play it on my computer...expect Amazon to do better than this."
5,"Cheap, affordable, easy, quick!","For [the price], you can't go wrong with these. I've never heard of the company before, but that didn't stop me; and I'm glad it didn't. I use these CDRWs for backing up files and for testing CD image burns before I do them to a CDR. I've yet to have a bad write using EZ CD Pro, EZ CD Creator, and CDRWIN. For whatever reason you may need these for, they'll probably do the trick for less. Some people complain about not being able to use them except for on a computer--that's not entirely the case. Most CD players built after 1997 should be able to read CDRW, if not its still unlikely to be the disc's fault; if your player can't read these, it probably can't read any CDRWs. Has something to do with laser intensity I think, but that's not the point. Get these if you need CDRWs and you won't be sorry."
1,Only two of ten good,I could format only two of the ten discs with CD-RW that came with new Dell computer. Adaptec Direct CD Wizard regarded them as bad discs and would not format. Other brands I got at store did format ok.
5,Extraordinary,"This is a must for every guitar player/ music fun. It's solid, strong and innovative with Steve playing at his best. It has beautiful moments and also some hard ones with the electric guitar screaming and jumping all over the place. It's amazing how this composer captures all the escense of the instrument and creates an atmosphere that can vary a 100% during the track/song. Probably this is the most mature and coherent work of Steve as of today. If you really appreciate the innovatives works on the guitar, such as the ones related to Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew, David Torn or Pat Metheny you should have this record, which I think is one of the best (ever)."
3,Not his best but still worthwhile,"Pictures of Fidelman is a series of six fairly independent tales of Arthur Fidelman, a Bronx Jew and failed painter who has traveled to Rome to write on Giotto. He seems unable to move forward with his new life nor to completely let go of his desire to be a successful painter. He bounces around Italy trying to find himself (or maybe lose himself) but never seems to accomplish either. The fifth of the stories is an attempt by Malamud at stream of consciousness (the title of the story is ""Portraits of the Artist"") otherwise they are typically Malamud who writes cleanly and passionately."
4,"The wittier, lighter side of Malamud","This is a series of six episodes in the life of New Yorker Arthur Fidelman, a painter who once aspired to be great, but didn't know how to get there, and now cannot identify what he wants in life, or how to get it. He moves to Italy and is promptly taken advantage of in every way imaginable, while he runs into some quirky and amusing characters who teach him many life-lessons and eventually help him discover his own identity.This is a terrific and imaginative work and each misadventure that Fidelman embarks on is unique and funny. I pictured a ""slightly stranger looking than Woody Allen"" character, full of paranoia and uncertainty, and yet plodding along, tentative, determined to experience something new and creative."
4,A remarkable diary,"I came upon this book in my local library and promptly checked it out. Yes, it does seem confusing but then again, when we look at the context within which this was written, the confusing aspect of the work seems natural. The author went through living hell during her period in the work and death camps, and it was a miracle that her attempts to keep a diary, however fragmented the entries may seem, was successful. This work is such a valuable documentation of a teenager's experience of the Holocaust...reading her entries, one gets an intimate glimpse of the unimaginable horror she went through, things we could not fathom or imagine, yet very real. I rank this work right up there with the Diary of Anne Frank, and other memoirs of the Holocaust period, like A Jump for Life by Ruth Cyprys."
3,Alright Book,The Beautiful Days Of My Youth by Ana Novac is a book based on Ana's diary she kept while at Auschwitz and Plaszow. This is not the most well written book but not many 15 year olds could even write while going through the horrendous conditions at Auschwitz and Plaszow. We follow her life through the concentration camps as she is worked nearly to death and fights sickness after sickness until Britain soldiers liberate her camp. Overall the book is a bit confusing at times and a tad boring at times but a book that describes the life of a teenage girl at a concentration camp pretty well.
3,The Beautiful Days of My Youth: Purchased at Amazon.com,"This is not my type of book. To say the least, the author seems very observant and very intelligent the way she writes. However, this is the type of writing I find difficult to follow. There isn't enough of a story to really hold my interest, though I did make it through the whole book."
5,With few accounts of what happened this book is a rare gem.,I thought reading this book was an important experience
1,inediable,the worst online purchase i have ever made i was afraid to use it did not taste or smell like vanilla i feared death
2,Don't waste your money,"I was able to get a huuuuge version of this for $3 more when I went to Cancun, unfortunately I had accidentally packed it on the carry on and it was confiscated. I personally don't think paying $21 for 7 oz is worth it......."
1,very unattractive toy,"My son wanted it badly, but once he saw it - lost all the interest. This toy is not very well made AND THE PRICE IS NOT CHEAP."
1,The perfect book for the female chauvenist sow!!,"Simply put, this book reinforces the universally known fact that all men are, by nature (or otherwise), pigs. This pillar of truth is ESSENTIAL for all young children of both genders to understand. This truth will set our daughters free of all the evils of men, and our sons will be justly saddled with the true nature of their existence.Oh wait, I'm a male and therefore have no right to review this book. Please ignore my piggish oversight. After all, I can't help it - I'm just a pig."
2,not all that good.,"I can't understand why people think this book is really good. The professor was not nice and should have gotten her job back for her. On the last page it says, ""My dearest girl, I gave notice on your behalf when I got here this morning."" How presumputous of him. He thought he was a shoe in and quite a catch apparently and that of course she would marry him. If he had done that to me, I would have run the other way and went and got my job back. But at least there wasn't any violence. I got this book from the free area at the library and don't think enough of it to take it back there."
1,Very disappointing,"Much of the content of this book is simple but tedious arithmetic and graphical presentations which give the impression of an unconvincing mix of documented fact and conjecture.Ample inclusion of much equally unconvincing and largely irrelevant terminology (""The Babylonians also measured... ...using a unit called SHE which literally means 'barley corn'"") does little to shed light on the subject.One could go on but perhaps most telling is the author's allocation of 6 pages (one mostly blank and two and a half containing charts and a photograph) to ""Arabic Astronomy,"" from which came many star names still in use throughout the world and which, some might say, passed almost the entire heritage of astronomy to the Europeans when their commercial interests turned them to navigation at the end of the 15th century (a point not mentioned by the author - his characterization of the Hellenistic Greeks as ""Europeans"" would probably have been disputed by any member of that ancient culture)."
5,A great book,"I've been using this book for the last three weeks and although I'm not far into it, I've found it very helpful and easy to understand. The CD really helps and the instructions are very clear."
4,Very Good Teaching Tool,I am a beginner guitarist and I do feel this book is very clear. I like it and would love to have more by Aaron Stang.
1,Waste of time,"I am writing to you to express disappoint in purchasing one of your books. I bought ""The 21st Century Guitar Method"", ""GUITAR METHOD 1"" about three months ago with the hope I could teach myself how to play the guitar. I hoped that this book would be written to address people who have never picked up a guitar before and to teach themselves some guitar basics. Well that did not happen. After three months I am still trying to understand music notes (that look like spaghetti to me) and the proper way to hold a guitar (hand placements). This book was not written for beginners. Who ever wrote this book may have had a working knowledge of playing a guitar but does not know how to teach beginning students how to play.As you can tell I am very disappoint and I feel cheated in my purchase. If another book is written to teach people to play the guitar, writing the book with beginning students in mind would be a great asset especially to the students.I would not recommend this book."
1,Awful,"The notion that Reagan was a great president is nonsense. The notion that he was a great man is blasphemy. His legacy is really the destruction of the ozone layer, homelessness, and a skyrocketing deficit. This book reads like some propoganda designed by the same people who thought Hitler was a great man. Obviously people still believe that if you tell a lie long enough, people will begin to believe that it is the truth. Reading this book and the nonsense values that Reagan so proudly presented, made me think that his Alzheimer's disease took root a long time before he became president. This book is about the veiled words of a hate monger. If you like this book, I suggest your next reading should be MEIN KAMPF."
5,"Stylish and incisive, with an edge of urban unease...","This collection is masterly! Lay aside all your preconceptions about the horror genre and just read these stories: they're intelligent, witty, wistful, genuinely unsettling and written with a wonderful eye for the small and horrifyingly day-to-day details which make life so much crueller than fiction. What a pity that this guy has been pigeonholed as a mainstream horror writer when in fact he's so much better than what I've come to expect from the genre nowadays. ""Looking For Bolivar"" is my favourite: a terrific story in any context. His novels are great, too. Try them!"
1,Stopped holding its charge in about 3 months...just like the Canon Battery,I bought this battery the same time I bought a Canon one so I can compare the difference. I guess there's no difference as they both are starting to lose their charge. It's been about 3 months since I purchased them from Amazon.I guess it's true when they say batteries are a crap shot.The original Canon battery that came with the camera did a bit better and lasted about 1 year and 3 months.
2,"Ok, but only for a short time","Similar to other reviews, this battery worked great for about 1 year and now won't take more than 6 pictures on a fully charged batteries before it is dead again."
4,Great guide for beginners and advanced,"Overall a great book if you are interested in wildflower identification. I wish there were more pictures. Once you learn the coding, it is easy to narrow what you are looking for. I tried identifying a a flower that I already new by using the coding and was able to go directly to it. Using it to identify others you don't know takes a little practice, but it cuts your search time way down."
3,"Nice book, but..","there's no way to tell from the web pages, but this book is only about wildflowers in the Northeast portion of the U.S., didn't do me much good in California.Was a Christmas gift that will be returned.Amazon.com should make it plain that it's regional."
2,Look for more pictures,short on pictures disapointed! Illustrations are okay but no color I would prefer a book with real pictures. would not recommend!
5,Black & White Is Good,"If you're looking for a field guide with pretty pictures of flowers, don't buy this guide. (The Audobon Society's field guide series has wonderful full color plates.) If you're looking for a field guide which will actually help you identify flowering plants, buy this guide! I have used it for both recreational observation and scientific research purposes, and it is user-friendly and accurate. The pictures are printed in black and white for a good reason- flower color is variable in nature, and color pictures could be misleading. Shape and structure (number of petals, etc) are much LESS variable, and thus better represented in black and white. Also, the dichotomous key structure of the guide makes it easy to quickly identify your specimens. Highly recommended (for Eastern United States only.)"
4,Attentive and willing to make the order right,"The first copy I ordered was missing some pages and had others in the wrong order. One quick email to the seller resulted in a fresh, new, and perfect copy sent to me. I was impressed with this level of customer service, and recommend the seller highly."
3,Newcomb's from (...),"Dissapointed. Not as easy to use as imagined and the example i used did not work well with the ID system. I would not have ordered the book anyway had I known it was restricted to its geographical area (amazon needs to improve its description!) And the ""anonymous"" will not uncheck!"
3,Detailed but hard to follow,"It's a great book for serious wildflower lovers, but it's somewhat hard to follow. As a non-professional plant lover I found the book useful, but had a difficult time finding the info I needed without a lot of page turning."
5,Hands-down best (for the Northeast),"This is the easiest-to-use and most thorough flower guide I've ever seen. Yes, most illustrations are black-and-white. It's an initial disappointment; however, the quick and sure five-step identification process is worth the lack of color (and the drawings are expertly done). It's much more complete than, say, the Audubon guide. Newcomb has yet to leave me stumped for the identity of any flowering plant. As has been noted, this guide is valid for the Northeast U.S., from Virginia-Kentucky up; and for Canada from Thunder Bay to Newfoundland. I wish the rest of you had a version -- it's indispensible."
2,Not So Good For Amateurs,"90 percent (or more) of the illustrations in this book are black and white line drawings... the color drawings leave much to be desired in terms of any identifiable details. I have found the book somewhat useful as a backup when I think I know what a flower may be, based on identification from another source, and want to check some details or the range of the plant. If you want to try to identify something from a flower (picture) and don't have the plant in front of you where you can work through the details of the leaves, plant structure, etc. - forget it! Had I been in a bookstore physically looking at the books, I wouldn't have purchased this one."
4,Great Guide,"If all the drawings in this book were in color, then this book would be hard to beat. I love this guide, but sometimes I have to reference a book with color pictures to be certain of an identification."
3,More interested in sunscreen,"I bought this product mainly for the sunscreen properties. I can't seem to find my other product anymore, so I had to find a substitute. This product is not bad at what I wanted it for, though I do not know what SPF it is rated at, I usually try for at least 15 or better. Working outside, having a bald spot, and not liking hats, I need protection. This product does just alright, not thrilled with cruchy hair though."
4,Would like a detachable valve,"It's a good product overall, I intend to use it all the time with the Dromedary bags. The valve takes some time to get used to though. I couldn't get a steady flow for awhile at first. I guess practice makes perfect. Also the tubing is made of a tasteless material but I most certainly can smell it. At some point I wished the valve could be detached so I could just drain the bag on the go without having to unscrew the connector from the bag.On the other hand it makes a great add on to small Dromedary bags which could come with this thing included, but they don't, so we need to spend some more."
2,"Sorry, what was that?","Is what your ear asks the whole time listening to this recording. Intonation is shaky throughout, specially in the bass part, tempos fast, and all the immense richness and complexity of Gesualdo is gone. Neither clearity nor expressiveness is to be found in this recording by the otherwise very good Hiller ensemble. The group seems to be lacking artistic guidance and a supervising ear here. One keeps wishing Herreweghe to record this Responsoria soon. This is no more than simply amazing amazing amazing music -- still to be materialized, almost 400 years after its prophetic birth."
2,Not the Japan I know,"An interesting story to be sure, but the author is often condescending about Japanese culture in areas where he completely misunderstands it. As I moved through the book I got increasingly frustrated with his characterizations of the Japanese people and the motivations for their actions. If you can get over Twigger's need to feel superior to the Japanese and a healthy smattering of details that he clearly made up to fill in the story (Japanese people calling someone who kisses to much Kissama doesn't make sense given Japanese pronunciation), I suppose the book is ok. It moves along fairly well, though the narrative is a bit choppy at times. I couldn't get over the skewed portrayal of Japan and that ruined the book for me."
2,"Confusing, but interesting","I thought this was an interesting enough book, I finished it quickly, but I found the story a bit confusing. The names of the different students muddled together as I read it. By the end I was left with a bit of a 'so what' feeling. So, the author went through some stupidly harsh training in an organization that seemed rather sad. OK. So what? What did he get out of it? What did he learn?His description of the Aikido organization he was involved with was pretty sad too. All the senior teachers sounded rather pathetic. Like (pathologically sadistic) businessmen putting in time until retirement. As someone with an interest in Aikido, it kind of turned me off the whole thing.I think a bit less reporting and a bit more introspection, as well as a more careful control of the narrative to avoid confusion in the reader, would have made it a better book. It's a bit dated now too, being from the mid 90's."
3,The mellowest record ever from Portastatic,"While Portastatic's first film score ""Looking For Leonard"" sounded a lot like a Portastatic instrumental record, ""Who Loves The Sun"" takes the plunge directly into a more ""cinematic"" sound -- if you didn't know who it was, you'd certainly not guess from the mellow, sunny arrangements and (gasp) flutes... and... strings?Here, in fact, is where the strings come in.This is one your grandmother could enjoy, or a fan of lugubrious 60's Italian pop, or even your conservative Republican uncle. Play it for them, then divulge that they've been listening to indie rock all along!Mac McCaughan has been diligent -- there's a lot of film soundtrack history in evidence here, from short transitional pieces like ""Maggie and Mary"" to the airy piano piece ""Snake Music."" McCaughan has taken his considerable pop chops and applied them to instrumental storytelling with an intriguing and limited palette of instruments."
2,some good some bad,"I bought the 20 pack (before I bought the a LaCrosse BC-900 charger through Amazon) and ended up throwing out 15 of them. They come in 5 individual packages of 4. It seems that every four pack had at least 1 bad and that prevented the panasonic charger that I was using to properly charge the good ones since charging is prevented if 1 battery in the charger is bad. When I got the LaCrosse Charger which independantly charges each battery, I figured that I'd try the remaining 5 batteries that I had. 3 of them are close to the 2000mAh (I have the older version, not the 2500mAh ones pictured here) that the label claimed, 1 would only accept 1000mAh, 1 would not charge at all. If my results are typical, that means 60% of them are fine. If that is the case, this still may be cheaper than buying the more expensive brands which are more than double the price. I wouldn't do it again though."
1,Short lifespan,"O.k., I purchased these batteries over a year ago and only opened the pack now. These batteries will not hold a charge and my charger indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives. I don't know what the normal lifespan of rechargeable batteries is, but these didn't last being on the shelf for a little over a year. I will never buy this brand again."
2,Poor Quality Control,"Bought various capacity Lenmar AAs (2000MAH, 2400MAH, 2500MAH) and the only consistent thing about them is their inconsistent quality control. Probably 10-15% are DOA and never will accept a charge despite using various chargers, including a Maha MHC808 which has a rejeuvenation and diagnostic function and shows them as nonfunctional. Another 10-15% leak and fail prematurely, then the rest work OK, but just OK. I've had better success with other brands."
1,Not good at all,"I have many this brand name batteries and I thought they are good, but I'm wrong. I tested them recently with my new charger, LaCrosse BC-900. Most of them only can hold about 600mAh(2000 or 2300 showing on the label), very few can hold over 1000mAh. Other brand name can hold near 2000mAh. I will not buy this brand any more."
1,Stay Away,"These batteries work OK, if they work at all. That's the problem: Out of a brand new pack of 20, only a fraction of them actually work, meaning take and hold a charge without making my charger's ""defective battery"" indicator starts blinking. And of the ones that work, they don't work for very long. Don't even dream of getting a light year's distance from the ""up to 1000 recharges"". Also, and perhaps most disturbing, is that shortly after purchase, I noticed that many of the batteries began showing a certain discoloration at the tops which looks a whole lot like battery leakage. This was true of batteries still plastic wrapped and never used.Note: This review is for the 2000mAh , 20-pack version."
4,Great re-chargables,"I bought these batteries several years ago. I have found that you do better if you use the charger designed for the battery. Also, I don't use these for my camera or the Wii remotes. I use a battery designed for use in high performance electronics. Instead I use these for things like my son's toys, our programmable thermostats and tv remotes.Like I said before, I have be using these batteries for about 4 or 5 years now and have not had any failures."
4,Great value,I have ordered a pack of these a couple different times -- the first batteries in the first pack lasted through about 400-500 charges before they went bad.I ordered 2nd pack and so far have used them through 100-125 charges and still going strong.Even considering rechargable batteries will NOT last as long as a standard battery these have paid for themselves many times over.I will be purchasing these again once the 2nd pack starts to wear out.
1,can't be worse,I bought 20 (a box). At least 8 cannot charge at all. And the capapcity is not as much as it mentioned. I will never buy this brand battery any more.
1,You get what you pay for...,"I've tried two boxes of these. Many were doa. Even if they work initially, they would not charge. I ended up with perhaps 8 out of those two boxes which worked for a short time. Ended up costing more than the name brand batteries. Not a bargain by any stretch... I wish the better batteries would come in larger quantity packs!"
1,THE BATTERIES ARE BAD AND THE COMPANY IS TERRIBLE.,"Lured by one of those Amazon special sales I purchased a 24 pack over a year ago .Did not need them immediately, so they were left on storage on an air conditioned room. Now that I need them, I tried to charge them and out of 24 batteries only 2 took a partial charge. I have some very fancy and expensive chargers, including the LaCrosse BC-900 and several others of less famous makers, not one charger could charge the other 22 batteries. I contacted the company for help, here is their reply: ""Unfortunately, the AA batteries you are using are out of warranty. Are you sure the problem lies with the batteries and not the charger?"". The policy of this company is not to stand behind their products and to blame the chargers for their lack of quality control. DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME AND MONEY BUYING LENMAR BATTERIES. Read the other reviews, everyone is having problems with Lenmar batteries."
3,"Not bad, not the best","These batteries work ok. You have to charge them just before using them. If they sit around for more than a day without use, plan on them dying quickly."
1,Save your money & stay away,"Even you are lucky and get some good batteries, they will die one after another when you are not using them."
1,Lenmar Rechargeable Batteries,These are the worst MiMH batteries I've ever used. I've tried both the AAs and AAAs. Most stop holding their charge in less than one year.
2,Remastered Audio should be called UN-Mastered re-do,"""The Colour Collection""[2007] is NOT Available Anymore, I hope.This is the same 'collection' of recordings as ""20th Century Masters"", Millenium Collection released in 2003. Billed as (remastered), a better designation would be ""Un-Mastered"". The audio is flat dynamically on the newer release[as if compressed or limited for dupping purposes].Not to worry, I returned the disc for a refund. I Love You, AMAZON!"
4,Best GPS-unit without built-in map,"I ordered my GPS II+ in december '98, and though there is now the III and III+, it is by battery life and easy handling the best GPS device I tried. Although it has the US-city-database, most european cities of evidence are included (and the rest of the world, too !!) - and the rest is easily to be loaded by pc + interface cable. It's easy to operate, and of worldwide use - GPS coverage in South Africa, Europe or in Scandinavia is OK for most purposes in hiking and biking navigation."
5,Great Unit,"I have been learning to sail and this unit is fantastic for coastal navigation. The ability to mark waypoints in advance and plot a route through them is great. Overall the features and construction have exceeded my expectations. My only criticism is of the documentation, which could be more extensive."
1,Topic does not match title.,This is completely call center focused and does not cover what the title states!
2,B+ undergrad student paper,"The book seems to be a raw summary of what the authors read and gathered from statistical reviews and reports about new trends in customer services and e-commerce. I found the book to be composed of some really interesting statistics and facts but rather trivial ideas.Too many words to express simple ideas and too many copy and paste from chapter to chapter.... My college professor would not grade it as an A-, I guess."
3,A Very Good Approach in CRM Industry,"Este Libro es muy explicativo de las Caracteristicas que debe poseer un CRM, sus Perifericos, nuevos enfoques sobre servicio al Cliente, Realmente es un libro muy estructurado acerca de las mas importantes nociones de los CRM"
3,Cute Necklace,"I purchased this necklace for my wedding. The chain seems a little cheap and kept getting twisted. It is not as solid as I thought it would be. The garnet is very pretty. For the price, I thought it would be a little nicer."
3,nice/ok,"this item is very nice, but the head comes off and breaks.the head only moves side to side , not up and down.:-["
5,Triple Duo is the wildest chamber music imaginable.,"I can't say about the other recording of ""Triple Duo"" (by Fires of London, for whom it was written) but the version here is by excellent musicians. It's an absolutely spectacular piece--19 minutes of chamber music by a mixed group as wild as you can imagine, with brilliant riffs coming from all six instruments in overlapping waves. ""Enchanted Preludes"" is also superb, the cello chasing the mercurial flute in a sort of strange courtship dance. Oh yeah, the Bach is pretty good too! (Actually, Demenga has to rival Yo Yo Ma for technique and warmth, though I think the recording of the Bach suite is done with a little too much echo.)"
2,needs a re-re-release,"It was a terrible marketing decision to use the Bach Cello Suites as a filler for the other modernistic pieces that they were coupled with in this ECM New Series featuring Thomas Demenga. The liner notes go to great lengths to sell the buyer on the ties that bind the Bach to the 20th century composers but it sounds more like begging than explaining. The Zimmerman, the Hosokawa, Yun, Verese, Holliger and Carter pieces need to be collected together on a series of recordings and the Bach either jettisoned or sequestered. Maybe someday a re-release will save what's good about this series and reduce 6 mediocre CD recordings down to what should be 3. Buy the Bach elsewhere--there are over a dozen great choices."
5,Masami Okui-sama,"Ok, track two, the song from Utena is called ""Toki Ni Ai Wa"" which means something like ""At Times, Love is"" Just thought I clear that up for ya'll. Enjoy the CD!"
3,Not a B. Just a C+,"I give it a C+; better than average but not good. To be honest, I was disappointed. I haven't bought a camera in five years, so perhaps my expectations were out of line, but I expected more for my money.My advice: if you can hold out a while for digital prices to drop, it'll be worth the wait."
3,3 1/2 * Mysterious Sounds During a Sleep-Over!,"This is a fairly interesting book about a sleepover at a friend's and the ways they alternately laugh and get a little scared about the possibilities of ghosts in the house. The author convincingly portrays two friends playing: They joke, eat spaghetti, tell stories, and play with their pets. On a dark and stormy night (what else?) the boys are awakened by unusual sounds from the piano downstairs; (DON'T read the following if you want a surprise!) it's the two hamsters eating crumbs off the piano! 48 pages with nice (but not exceptional) color pictures. Although the publisher calls this an ""easy-to-read mystery,"" I don't think it's for kids just beginning to read; some reading experience will help."
2,Dried-up Blottr,"I LOVE their product! BUT this particular bottle had a petrified ink blotter. I'm NOT kidding! It was hard as a rock! I had to chip away until I'd made a small hole through it, in order to gain access to the ink. Then I was able to refill my inkpad."
1,WELL Horrible Seller and shipper and product has some issues but.......,"GReat Product Horrible Seller and shipper. Product could have a stronger screw down for inside light /fuse to tighten will come apart after time and the wire will come loose from inside over period of time. over priced for it, but its small and has the hook awsome"
4,"A ""Must Have"" for students of Russian.","The previous reviews cover just about everything I wanted to say about Dermo. I am very pleased with this book and do NOT agree with the negative reviews.In regards to the missing stress marks, I have another small book called ""Dictionary of Russian Obscenities"" (available from Amazon), which lists all the same words and DOES have stress marks. However, it is not nearly as entertaining as Dermo.I highly recommend this book!"
4,"If you are learning Russian, you HAVE to get this book!","If you are learning Russian, there are some really ""good"" words in this book. This book has the words that the translators on TV don't translate. If you want to tell some one where to go in Russian, GET THIS BOOK!"
3,Needs an update,"The good and the bad about slang, it is always changing. I just spent a confusing 10 minutes trying to converse with a modern day young 20s Russian, and the slang they used was incomprehensible to me. Even translator sites had conniptions.I may have to find some fellow nerds in Moscow to move in with for a few months to truly get the patois down.Still, for the price this book is a good nose dive into ""realspeak"" rather than classroom talk."
4,For those occasions when the Berlitz vocabulary just will not do...,"Entertaining, raunchy and informative. This book is as likely to get you into trouble, as to keep you out of it.There are just some occasions when the standard, plain vanilla, Berlitz vocabulary is not up to the task. Dermo will ensure that you are 'loaded for bear' on those special occasions."
3,"Amusing, but not a very practical reference","The bawdy anecdotes and cartoons are funny, BUT beware that the book does not use accent marks for pronunciation and is not organized alphabetically."
2,Disappointing.,This book is a bit disappointing. Seems to be a sloppy work. Maybe I expected too much considering the very low price and the title... I give it two stars just for the effort of bringing many of the Russian expressions in one book.
3,Where are the accent marks???????????,"If this book was to be used only by scholars,(those guys who wouldn't cuss if their life depended on it) this book would undoubtedly deserve a 5 star rating.However, MOST people who buy this book will probably want to cuss at somebody once in a while and since discretion is the better part of valor,(saying something the other guy doesn't understand) they will probably try a couple of Mr Topol's gems.That will be fine with non-Russian folks, but try ANY of them with a Russian and you stand a good chance of being laughed at because you simply will not know which syllable to accent in your pronunciation. Think about it...If you say something really offensive to a Russian and pronounce it wrong, he'll probably be laughing like mad when he punches you out!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The book explains Russian obscene words that are used daily.,"This book really helps to understand the modern day obscene Russian. It is not only a dictionary, but also more of an encyclopedia. The author describes the meaning of the phrases, words; and how and where they are used. This book is very useful for non-Russian speakers who are planing to visit Russia and don't want to be embarrassed."
2,Disappointing,"He was/is a good songwriter and singer with the Eagles, but this thing falls flat on its face. He seems off key in places and the songs lack anything approaching emotion. ""The Shadow"" is ok, but the rest of the album stinks. He must have had a contractual obligation to put this thing out. I think I wasted $$."
4,Tim Schmit low profile achiever,"Compared to Henley Frey and Walsh, Schmit is low profile and underrated. He has a smooth brilliant high singing voice and a lovely turn of phrase in his songs. He writes songs from personal experience with heart felt emotions. This album is certainly his finest clearly displaying his extrordinary talents. He does the acoustic guitar on The Shadow which is a lovely tune with lots of string noise which adds to the ambience. Every song is You is a driving song in the vein of his Poco Seven efforts. Schmit covers the Stylistics You are Everything contributing all vocals in a brilliant rendition of a great tune. These are just some of the highlights. If you like Poco and the Eagles ""Long Run"" try this album it has a beauty that Henley rarely achieves and Frey almost never does. The Eagles long awaited new album hopefully will see Schmit`s talent more to the fore where they belong."
5,Buy it - you'll enjoy it,"If you have found your way to this listing, then surely you know TBS and his distictive voice.Buy it, you'll love it from the first time you play it.My personal favorite is ""I'm Not Angry Anymore"" but all of the songs are good - no filler."
2,Great Features but short Life,"The features on this bargain DVD player are excellent. The player has a great function display on it's face and good on screen prompts. The problem is it suddenly quit loading DVDs after less than sixteen months and is now junk. So if you want a good DVD player that will last you just long enough to be beyond the one-year parts warrantee, this is the unit for you."
4,excellent value,"This DVD player was cheap... in fact the store where I bought my computer (not cheap) actually threw it in as a bonus. I was quite amazed to find out that it has a great 10-bit video DAC, and a 24-bit/96Khz audio DAC. AND a digital audio receiver chip which can decode HDCD! This is a relatively high-end feature, as is the digital optical TOSLINK output. Picture quality is excellent. Audio is beyond what one would expect for an el-cheapo-deluxe player, in fact is on part with much more expensive units. I guess quality of output FAR FAR outstrips ""soft buttons on the remote"" as a selling feature for me (as one other reviewer whined). It can also play CD's, MP-3 discs (CD-R AND CD-RW) and PhotoCD format discs! What more could you ask for $50?"
2,Covers servlets basic very well (specifically jsdk2.0),"If you are new to servlets, this book will certainly help you understand the power of servlets. I do not recommend this book to those who are looking for some advanced examples or some examples specific to servlets v2.1."
4,No Nonsense Practical Guide for the Servlet Developer,"This book provides clear-cut, practical examples that successively build up to the prototypical ecommerce application - - the web shopping cart. The author does rely on a certain amount of familarity w/ OO concepts but avoids much of the techno jargon found in other texts. A required read for those of us who need real-world examples/explanations for building ecommerce web sites w/ Java technologies"
1,Please do not buy this book!,This is the worst I've ever read. It starts off with the idea that all servlets should use an HTML object packager (which may or may not be of any value to the reader) then uses this as the basis for the subsequent examples in each chapter. Stupid! How about just explaining some theory and giving useful tips and just letting the reader decide on their own approach! Terrible book. I wish I could get my money back.
4,Quick guide to the server-side,"I was pleased to learn so quickly about server-side Java. This book is called servlets but also handles interesting topics like JSP, RMI and Corba. Those topics are very brief, though. Otherwise this book would have been ten times the size.It does have mistakes that only attentive readers might catch. It was a bit annoying that all these re-usable components were explained, Chpater 4 about the HTML Objects could be completely skipped without harm. A CD-rom containing this code could be handy. Perhaps they can do so when re-printing.I quickly learned to make servlets so it's a good book for it. It does require you to have some expertise in Java, but if you want to write servlets then you should already have that."
3,"Easy read, but not in depth","This book jumps right into setting up re-usable Servlet components before a novice would even have a chance to understand the code. Repitition would have been a better learning tool, but the re-usable Servlet components distract from the learning and make it more difficult.Overall, the book could have been deeper and more illuminating for the experienced Servlet developer. All in all not a bad book for novices if you skip the re-usable Servlets. Not recommended as a good long term reference."
4,very comprehensive !!,"this book provides both beginner's and advanced information for developing Java Servlets. it includes useful examples like connecting servlets & applets, servlets and JDBC etc."
2,Just examples - little explaination,"I am a relatively new Java programmer and bought this book hoping it would greatly aid me in the development of Java Servlets. Unfortunately, the book is very disappointing. Not only is the book full of mistakes, but the web site is missing code, and examples are poorly commented on. If you are looking for a good book for explaining Java Servlets, this is not it. If you are a seasoned Java programmer, it may server you better. Personally, I would just go to java.sun.com to learn servlets and save my money."
4,"Terrific, intense performance by JC in an engrossing gangster tale","This Hong Kong-made flick is great, like an Asian version of SCARFACE. Jackie is a Chinese immigrant in Japan who works his way up from a lowly dishwasher to a gang lord.This is an attempt by JC to do a serious, intense acting part which... relies on his acting ability and magnetic charisma rather than pure physicality or making funny faces. He does a terrific job.I have not paid much attention to Jackie's recent Hollywood pics - SPY NEXT DOOR, etc., as they were just too goofy, beneath his ability. However, his HK flicks of late are usually more ambitious, less pandering. If they are anything like SHINJUKU, I have some serious catching up to do!"
2,only OK,"This wasn't a bad gangster movie. It is interesting to see Jackie Chan trying to act dramatically. But he is just OK and so is the movie. It is similar to (not the same as) ""Infernal Affairs"" and ""A Better Tomorrow"" but not as good.I give points for seeing Jackie Chan's character attempt to do a little Jackie Chan stuff and have that take a nasty toll on his body, as it would my own."
5,A fitting sequel to the initial work of art,"I bought this after devouring Goshawk Squadron, A Piece of Cake & A Good Clean Fight. I was not disappointed and found myself hungering for more.For any reader that desires a more realistic look at the air war of WW1 without being depressed into near suicide with the sheer futility of the actions of the whole scene, this is the book to read.I would suggest reading Goshawk Squadron first, if only for the additional backgound. Having said that im quite confident that I would not have enjoyed this wonderful piece of work any less had this been the first of Derek Robinson's books that I picked up..."
2,Narrated silent movie,"This is a compiled and narrated version of some of Chaplin's Essanay films. The only reasons to buy it is if you want a total complete collection of Chaplin's releases, or if you want to experience, how people thought about silent movies in the sixties. The narration make you feel like you are treated like an imbecile.If you buy Images other releases, the Essanay films vol. 1-3, you will get the real quality of Chaplin's great films."
2,Understandable yet may not aid understanding,"I sympathize and understand where Unger is coming from in writing this, but I can't help but feel it leads to fixing our eyes on the wrong spirit in this cosmic battle. With all that is in me I implore the reader to root and ground their understanding and faith in the revelations revealed in the timeless classic 'What Saints Can Do To Demons', also known as 'The Bible'."
3,"Has ""horns"" not shown in phpt","There is a bracket at each end on top of the broom, so that you can clamp the head on the handle. These horns are made of hard plastic, same as the head of the broom. Nice idea, but it means the broom will not sweep under stuff that you would think it would, from seeing the photo on Amazon. I wanted to sweep under a railing, and I kept banging the horns. I can cut them off, but it won't be pretty. I just used it once so far, but it is very stiff. Probably better for big stuff. To be very, I used it on a textured surface. It might be better on a smooth surface like smooth concrete."
3,Handle broke too easily,Broom head is terrific. I bought this for use by a Scouting troop. Only problem was that the handle broke very quickly.
4,Quickie 00528 18-Inch Bulldozer Push Broom Indoor/Outdoor,"This broom works great, just make sure you realize what size 18 inches is & that ""Bulldozer"" is part of the branding, not what the brush of this broom can do. With that said it's a good value for the money. Easily capable of sweeping up most garage dirt & dust...sidewalk/driveway too. I wouldn't use this in my house, simply because I really like my hardwood & stone floors, but I also wouldn't use my indoor sweeper outside (& bring it back in). It does a great job for a homeowner's broom, the term ""bulldozer"" just makes me laugh."
3,Had to Send Back,Unfortunately I had to send this broom back before I even used it as it was bent upon arrival so I blame that on poor packing and handling so that's why I gave it a 3 star as the broom probably would have worked just fine but I never got a chance to use it.
2,Not all subtitled as advertised,"I saw this film on the Sundance Channel and liked the movie because it is a powerful acting by Edgar Ramirez. I order all my DVD's with either closed captioning and/or subtitled in English, because I have hearing difficulties, needless to say, this was advertised as being subtitled in English but only the non-English portions of the film are subtitled, which is a very disappointing for all of us who have hearing difficulties and rely on true information concerning subtitles and/or closed captioning.."
2,Disappointingly Superficial,"I had hopes that this would be an interesting and detailed look at '70s political violence, but I was surprised at the relative superficiality and repetitiveness of the film. Was the political content minimized to avoid offense to someone? (Johnnie Walker and Hertz make repeated appearances.) It's hard to see any motivation for Carlos's actions, beyond machismo, and the lackluster screenwriting makes for a protracted viewing experience, to be sure. ""The Baader Meinhof Complex"" was much more successful at compressing complex historical events; and better yet, one could watch a real film like Costa-Gavras's ""Z."" This one just seems like it was made on auto-pilot."
1,Serious problem with this documentary,"I was looking forward to viewing this generally highly-rated documentary. However, the English subtitles are few and far between and are hugely abbreviated versions of the conversations taking place. I found it impossible to get more than a very vague idea of what was going on. I did not watch beyond an hour---that was enough. Shame on those making money from selling this so-called English subtitled DVD set."
1,weak,"waste of time. I've expected more from this movie, but 3 discs to show carlo's life is a lot of time. Don't waste your money!"
1,Boring and dumb,"I bought this movie because a friend of mine told me it was a bio-pic about Carlos Mencia, and that was all I needed to know. Turns out it is just a boring and VERY LONG movie about some terrorist. I was high on painkillers and still got nothing out of this movie which is just way too long. Very disappointed in this movie and also I am going to downvote all the positive reviews because they're obviously written by Philistines (PLEASE NOTE: I UNCONDITIONALLY SUPPORT ISRAEL)."
1,bad movie,"it was one of the worst movies i've ever seen. everything starting from the cinematography and finishing with acting and music made no sense. almost fell asleep somewhere in the middle.PS"" why is this site making me write so many words?"""
3,"Cute and light, but...","This short wave radio also comes with a built in alarm clock. The problem is that it stopped working all of a sudden after just a year. The warranty only lasts for 90 days and Sony will repair it, but the repairs cost more than the radio!"
2,a bit dissapointing ...,For a Sony product in this price range the overall quality of the unit is very poor ... it's appearance is cheap and the performance of the tuner inside is indescribably poor as well I would not make the mistake of buying this product again
3,Leave the Office Earlier and Be Home with Your Family,"I bought this book while juggling a difficult job which required more time at work and on the road than I anticipated. There were many good ideas for organization which were easy to put into practice. It helped me to put some living back into my life. Although a person can read it cover to cover, information can be gleaned at random when only a few minutes are available.I have also loaned this book to other struggling young mothers and it has been interesting to see how they have chosen different tactics to improve their quality of life."
2,The Author Has Never Actually Worked in an Office!,"You have to be carefull with these National Speakers Asso. folks who write their speech into a book. The author says in the book that she heard Zig Ziglar when she was 14, skipped her Senior year of high school, took some business courses in college and went out on the speech circut. Her lack of real world work experience shows in the book. Many many topics with nothing covered in depth. No advice on dealing with conflicting priorities - just the suggestion that you not let your priorities conflict. Lots of her advice has nothing to do with productivity like ""you should dress professionally"" and when it does it is pretty simplistic like ""say no from the heart."" I was looking for a corporate veteran who would share proven techniques to get the right things done and get home earlier - I did not find it in this book."
5,I Learned a Lot of Very Useful Tools,"It is obvious Laura Stack has a lot of hands-on experience working with people like me who are not naturally organized. Her style is a wonderful mix of stories, examples, theory, practice and concrete tips. It's a great read, completely current and I took notes all through. I stopped from time to time to learn more about resources she mentions that I had never heard of. Naturally the book itself is masterfully organized. My only complaints are that she uses memory tools to help remember her steps that are too long for me to remember. Also there is no index. Get it anyway. I expect to return to this book again and again."
1,"Good Read, Bad Quality","I love the Elsie books and quite enjoyed this one. However, the quality of the digitalized text was not very good. There were frequent misspellings and random line breaks. More so than many books I've purchased on the Kindle for free. I found it much easier to read the free PDF version I found on Google books."
1,"Good book, but poor copy!","I am reading all the Elsie books on my Kindle, but was very disappointed that I had to pay anything at all for such a poor copy. Almost every page had a typo--sometimes 4 or 5 on one page! This is the only copy I could find at the time on Kindle, so I had no choice but to buy it. I would have been more understanding if it had been free, but couldn't believe that I would be charged for such poor quality. The story was wonderful, as usual, but a weak reader would have struggled. On occasion I, too, had to think hard about what a word might be."
1,It's in MONO,"Would love to purchase this album, but Ryko seems to have sent out the defective mono version of this release to all online music vendors, including Amazon and iTunes."
2,"A nice collection for major Ministry fans, but not a ""must have""","I give this two stars only relative to Ministy's other discography. Because compared to Psalm, The Mind is a Terrible Thing, Last Sucker, Rio Grande... this isn't quite up to those levels. But it a very cool collection of several Al/Minisrty side projects together on one CD. Minor Threat is one of my favorite bands so I was really looking forward to the Pailhead material with Ian MacKaye, and interestingly they ended up being my favorites on the disc. I think the HomoDJ stuff is ""just OK"" and the other highlight I'd say is the Sabbath cover, Supernaut. Overall Side Trax is something Ministry fans might find interesting, but it's a bit of a departure from Ministry's more-intense releases."
2,It's not just bad remastering!,"The problem here goes beyond just bad remastering. The first second or two of the first track, ""Man Should Surrender"", is actually CUT OFF!! This wouldn't matter so much if it were a song that fades in, but this song starts right on the beat. The original vinyl is the only way to hear this song begin on the first beat. The PAILHEAD cd that preceded this one made the same mistake with this same song, although not as much was cut off there as on SIDE TRAX. I bought this CD partly to correct that problem, but no such luck. At least the other Ministry reissue, EARLY TRAX, corrected this problem with the song, ""Every Day Is Holloween"". The begining of that song was butchered this same way on the TWELVE INCH SINGLES cd."
3,A Little Too Concise,"This is a review of the first edition, 1989, hardcover. While there are no objections to the material presented, it is just that there is not quite enough to be called an encyclopedia. Only important high-style pieces are pictured, mainly from England, France and the United States. There are some examples from Spain, Italy, Russia, etc., but they are in the minority. The text starts with ancient Egypt and ends with ""modern times"" of the 1980s. There is a Select Bibliography, A Guide to Recognizing and Dating Furniture, The Anatomy of Furniture, and an Index. Most of the photos are in color and are very precise, like for an auction catalog, but others, even more interesting, show the furniture in its original architectural setting. Readers might find it an acceptable basic reference, a platform from which more in-depth study can grow from additional sources."
5,Night Of Terror,Nine people have been invited to Justine Cameron's Halloween Party. The strange thing is these people are not exactly friends with each other.
5,Xcellent!,"I loved the book. Every moment of it. the thrilling thing is that the whole thing takes place on one night. at first in the book, everything seems so normal, exept for the fact that the 9 people called for the halloween party, don't get along too well. In the middle (if u have brains) u will be able to guess the killer. The ending of the book was fab. The motive behind the----- was xcellent too. The bhook was very good but not the best i have read. the best i've read till now is the Mind Reader. it's totally fab. i highly recommend the book. i congratulate r.l.stine on this fab book."
1,Not so good.,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but it was ok. Only a little suspenseful. Little bit of gore. The killer was so obvious. The end was pretty exciting, though. It could have been better."
5,Night of Halloween Fun . . . Or Terror,"A new girl in school invites certain people to a Halloween party. But there is no rhyme or reason as to why she invites these particular ones. They wonder why she chooses the ones she did. They aren't necessarily her friends, or friends with each other. It seems as though she picked people at random. A few people got their feelings hurt because they weren't invited. And there is a peculiar mystique about this new girl in school.The people who were invited all go to the party. It starts out with a lot of food, music, and fun. There are Halloween pranks. Are they for fun or for real? You will find out. You will also find out what the mystique is about this girl. You also find out why she invited these particular people; there actually was a reason.R. L. Stine's Fear Street books are awesome. I have read many of them. Even though I am not a teen, I enjoy them. I don't think I will ever get too old for them. Sometimes we just need a fun, young, less serious book."
3,Wasn't the best.,Wasn't his best. It was good until you compare It to his rest.I personally didn't enjoy it that much.
4,Ian Somerhalder is in this movie,"I bought it because two of my favorite stars was in it, love Ian as Damon on Vampire Diaries and Kristen from Veronica Mars, and I did enjoy the movie. Would buy again if this one gets ruined."
3,pulse,"I think I got this film as a bonus when i picked up the really good Halloween remake. Anyway, it was ok. i watch it again last night. It has it's moments and I like the idea of the dead coming through the daily tech that we use. Not really scary and a little slow in the beginning but it was a good attempt. I like Pulse 2 more so."
1,"I liked it better when it was titled ""The Ring""","Okay, so instead of a killer video tape like in ""The Ring"" we get a ghostly computer program. This movie was just a mish-mash of things we have seen before. While the influence of ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" are very evident, fans of the horror genre can see retreads from other flicks as well. Craven even rips off his famous ""not-alone-in-the-bathtub-during-a-dream-sequence"" from the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street""!! What is with the blue tinge to everything? I guess the murky blue-tinged film helped hide the lackluster effects, but it got really grating. ""Pulse"" packs not scare factor, the characters are annoying, we've seen scarier and better ""electronic-ghost"" effects in previous films and gorehounds will be disappointed by the lack of gushy stuff...in short this film should disappoint every type of horror genre fan."
1,Awful!,"This was probably the worst horror film I have seen in quite a number of years. Besides being a rip-off of the movie series where people rent a video tape and die, the picture was dark throughout, the plot was very difficult to follow and it was difficult to figure out what you were seeing on the screen most of the time.The special effects looks something that any amateur could produce with a camcorder. The ending was ridiculous and what appeared to be a talented young adult cast, totally wasted their acting abilities on this awful film that goes nowhere."
2,Pul...ease,"As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew what it was. No surprises there but the real surprise was that I found the original murky, muddled and incoherent. Am I alone in that?This mess has been given a coat of polish; the story, such as it is, has been streamlined and it actually benefits from being dumbed down for a dumb American audience with plenty of CGI effects, always a crowd pleaser.I didn't care much for it, or its technology-gone-awry message but it should stop a gap when there's nothing else to do.I still wonder, has it, or its Japanese predecessor, any relation to the 1988 shocker - also called Pulse - with Cliff de Young which explored a very, very similar theme?"
4,well...i liked it....man,"you can buy this movie used for $3.95 or rent it,either way it is worth it,i think.pulse is a low budget horror flick and in my opinion they did a good job.pulse has a gritty doom like feel to it wich keeps the mood.the movie keeps moving and does not get hung up anywhere.it's got the creepy thing thruout.the red duct tape is awsome and in the end(spoiler)the bad guys win.........."
2,Almost flatlined,"Pulse is yet another remake of a Japanese horror film, but this one boasts that it has a screenplay by horror master Wes Craven. Whether or not that's true, Pulse doesn't offer much that we haven't seen before in the tons of drivel, PG-13 horror remakes before it. The ungodly good looking young cast, including Veronica Mars' Kristen Bell, Lost's Ian Somerhalder, Jonathan Tucker, and Christina Millian; are pretty much nothing worth noting either, but is that really a surprise. That aside, there are some wonderfully creepy moments to behold thanks to some great CGI effects, and the film's apocalyptic ending is a nice shot in the arm to boot. Those good points aside, the rest of Pulse is horror fodder, even with some re-edited moments to remove the PG-13 rating. Worth a look if for some reason you like the films to come out of the wave of Japanese PG-13 remakes, but otherwise there is plenty of other horror films that are far better and far more deserve your time."
2,This Pulse is dead,"They should leave this stuff to the Japanese.Like the previous writer had said,Who would go to this college.I would of said the town,city and state.If the people can't handle the truth it is not my problem.Anyway our main hero here is Mattie,a confused woman who can't understand why her boyfriend isn't returning her calls.Well he's not himself Mattie you see your sleazy lover has been spending way too much time on his computer with viruses.He now just unleashed it through ways of communication.All your friends are gone.Its up to her and whats his name to save the day or night or whatever.Maybe they should save it from itself.The only character who made in impact was Brad Dourif.He was even smart enough not to stay.Final words RENT PREY INSTEAD!"
2,Booo...I mean zzzzzzzz,"I think there was some interesting commentary trying to be made here. The movie looks good and creepy. Decent cast. However, there is the issue of the plot that makes no sense that kind of messes things up here. There is nothing scary or ""horror"" about this movie, so don't get too excited if you are a big horror fan. There is certainly no gore. Just a lot of creepy shadow-ghost-type things that can attack you or not attack you with no rhyme of reason."
3,Information Technology Age Psycho Thriller,"It is all a horror modern civilization brings about in dwelling through modern TV, radio and computing.Rather psychotic than entertaining thriller."
2,NO MORE CG PLEASE !!!!!!!!!,"Unlike another review I expected a lot from ""Pulse"", especially after seeing how scary the trailer was. The acting and premise were good enough, but I'm so sick and tired of FAKE-LOOKING SPECIAL EFFECTS I HAD TO write this review. Why can't we go back to the more realistic special FX of 70s/80s movies like ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Return of the Living Dead"", ""Phantasm"", and countless others? This is really getting ridiculous...producers and directors really need to understand that this trend is getting totally out of hand. Ineffective and fake effects are getting completely tiresome and they're ruining good ideas for horror films... we all need to write reviews and complain, please, I'm begging you. NO MORE FAKE EFFECTS PLEASE, GET REAL!!!"
3,"Worth Renting, Probably Not Worth Buying","The movie starts off very cliche with the young people drinking at a bar, doesn't every horror movie made recently always have some kids partying? It kind of gets old and sold me on the fact that this movie wasn't going to be very good. Because of the low expectancy at the beginning of the movie, I ended up kind of liking the movie when it was over. No, it isn't a break through masterpiece, but it is an interesting movie. What I like about the film is how real it seemed, not the fact about the monsters are attacking people, but how no one knows what the things are and never find out either. If this was really happening, would we be able to find out where the monster came from? I doubt it. Pulse isn't a scary movie at all, but it is an interesting one for at least one viewing. I doubt I'd watch this movie again, so I recommend renting the movie. It is just worth watching once"
2,Do You Want To See A Boring Movie?...,"PULSE is about as nerve-jangling as a ""very special"" episode of GHOST WHISPERER! I tried to like it. I kept waiting for the terror to begin, unable to accept the fact that this movie was just another ill-conceived remake. Apparently, the dead have found a way to get us through our computers and cellphones, coming after our ""will to live"". Now, this could have been a great story (please, watch the japanese original) if only those responsible had created a sense of creeping dread and interesting characters. Instead, we get a bunch of young college kids with the collective personality of bacteria. As for the ghosts, well, they're semi-creepy, but do so little that it doesn't much matter. There is no suspense, few thrills, and not much in the way of any true horror. Yecch!..."
2,This movie has flatlined,"When I read the box and saw Christina Milian as one of the main characters I should have known then that this movie wasnt going to live up to the hype. The plot is just weird this ""Thing"" it let loose via a computer virus moves via communication devices such as pc's, cell phones, pda etc and it sucks the will to live out of everyone that it can. It makes them want to kill themselves or give up on living at which point they turn to ash. Its just a bad movie and a waste of an hour and a half. Time is one thing you can waste but not recover so dont waste your time on this."
1,"Oh, this is just too bad...","I'm a fan of Kristen Bell's work, and she deserved better than this, frankly. The cover art makes one hopeful that PULSE is a zombie movie featuring the young and bright star of VERONICA MARS, but it disappoints to exhaustion. I don't know what the movie is about, frankly. Something about some attractive teenagers using text messaging and cellphones constantly, and then their souls are sucked out by gray, bald demons. I guess. Again, I don't know. Whatever happens, it isn't scary, it's just sort of boring. The entire film is the color blue, so if you watch it through a pair of 3-D glasses and keep your left eye closed, you won't be able to see anything.Also, Christina Milan should never be in a movie again. She is a very poor actress. Avoid this movie, but keep your eye out for Kristen Bell's future work."
2,"""DO YOU WANT TO MEET A GHOST...""","Never saw this theatrically, but I just watched the ""unrated"" version of this film. This was a genuinely creepy movie but the acting felt a little pushed. What I mean is that the dialogs sucked and the actors at times, just didn't seem to be enjoying their roles. The story overall is just kind of dumb. I'm sure some people will enjoy this movie, but I really didn't. I was hoping for something a little more nail biting, something that has an ""unknown"" and just eviscerates you. If your looking for a cheap thrill, this is your movie, if not, just avoid it because its not all that great."
2,WEAK PULSE,"Whether viewed as a cautionary tale about man's over dependence on mechanical support (cell phones, computers, etc.) or as a cheesey remake of another Japanese horror film, PULSE fails to deliver anything that will make your pulse quicken.Filmed in murky blues and near whites at times, the movie drudges along with incoherency a main ingredient of the storyline as a lovely lass investigates why her boyfriend committed suicide. Kristen Bell and Ian Somerhalder try valiantly, but others such as Ron Rifkin and a brief cameo by resident nutcase Brad Dourif only serve to show how hard it is to make a good horror movie these days. Please, let the Japanese have their own horror films and leave us alone!"
4,The scarier since The Ring & Two,"This movie enough to scare you at cinemas.But,I think the unrated version will be more scarier and more gore.Please release this DVD quickly because many fans out there wait for it.Don,t see it alone !!"
3,Well......,"This is my Department but Along the lines of horror......Lets see ,Well the movies has an ok kind of first beat to it.With the good also comes the bad,I liked the movie but it kinda seemed a little too drawn out.More or less a lotta talking so people who cant stand to be patientto follow the story should probably stay away or they might fallasleep.Aside from the Bad I liked the horror or freak factor parts in themovie they can make you jump, so if your in for a quick boost outof your seat you might wanna check it out.All in all its an ok average movie but the hype that they putinto selling it im not sure if it really lives up to its ownpulse.>:D"
2,Please...this film has no Pulse,"DOA - Good premise, but horrible acting and even worse direction. The actors are as monochrome as they come. Only gets two stars because of the special effects. Don't waste your money."
1,Just...bad,"What this movie had going for it:1.) Good CGI and cinematographyWhat it didn't have:1.) Suspense - no buildup at all; it jumps right into the climactic conclusion from moment one.2.) Character development - none! Just people you know nothing about dissolving into black ooze. Even the Jason and Freddy Krueger movies did a better job of making you care about the victims. All you know about these people is that they sleep around and like to hack into computers.3.) Good acting - self-explanatory; none of the cast members are likely to have an Academy Award in their future.4.) A coherent plot - if the ghosts are dependent on the communications network, then why don't they disappear after the infrastructure collapses? Only one of many silly blunders.It short it was like so many other films these days - a paper thin story used to showcase cool special effects. Think ""Van Helsing"" and ""The Ring 2."" PURE CRAP."
3,Movie sucks but the bass kick's a**,"Just like the title says, the movie is not that good but the bass sure is."
1,wana see a horror-able movie ??,"im a huge horror fan.. i love slasher movies,suspense horror almost evry good horror movie.I even like some of the cheesy movies like open water..but this is definately a no no. this is about some crazy idea of a computer virus that is connected to the world of the dead. The main character , who was a horrible actor as everyone else was, is a pretty blonde girl whose boyfriend is a loser computer hackjer and set off some virus that makes the dead able to get throught the computer and suck the life out of u. If u are one of these lucky people you will kill yourself and not be in this horrible movie. this is a disgrace to horror i coudn't even finish it because i was so dissapointed with it.From the preview i thought5 it was a good idea but the way they executed it wasnt...the acting was bad,special effects were bad, the way the people ""died"" wasnt exciting ..so this isnt worth even renting..Ok idea, bad directing,acting, everything"
1,"PULSE HAD POTENTIAL, BUT GOT IT ALL WRONG","Based on the Japanease version KAIRO, this thriller centers a group of college students who discover that a computer hacker unwittingly pirated a strange wireless signal that opens a doorway for evil spirits to cross over into the world. The evil spreads like a virus, and the students must race to find a way to stop it. As dreary and dark as it was, the movie has no sense of the word scary. And humiliates itself with boredom and gloominess. And has us laughing whenever a scary part occured. Even though the movie had the potential of being good, it failed to do so in a non scary, repulsive way that makes us all wonder why it was created in the first place."
3,Meh...,"This one was just meh...it was run-of-the-mill horror, designed to make you freak out about your technology use. I am pretty sure I got this free bundled with my Halloween remake and thats why it was on my DVD shelf. I watched it all the way through and then escorted it to my ""sell"" pile."
2,PURE GARBAGE,"i will not say much because most reviews already trashed the film enough ......... belive in them , this movie sucks , japanese movie sucks, i do not know why they became so important and ""cult"" nowdays ......... and the american remakes of the japanese films sucks even more."
3,Hellish Vision of Technological Pandora's Box ...,Another reason to rethink your broadband connection?PULSE offers a horrific vision of 21st century technology run amok. Malevolent beings somehow spread through modern day computer and technology systems to wreak havoc. The imagery is arresting as PULSE seems to offer a cautionary tale regarding the unintended consequences of our highly connected society.Does your Blackberry need an exorcism? You may wonder after watching PULSE!!
4,Interesting and useful instrument,Recently spent a month motorcycle travel in Europe using GPS III with local database information. Extremely useful when unsure of location. Interesting to track route and time between destinations. Readily captures signal. Accurate enough to use on walking tour in strange cities - keeps track of routes followed - distance covered. Amazing technology.
1,Out of Date,"This unit is totally out of date. It is a discontinued item, per Garmin website. Technology has advanced way beyond this 1999 model. Don't waste your money buying this electonic antique."
1,Don't EVER use Energizer UPS!,"I own an Energizer UPS I've used for 2 years (which apparently is actually a Technuity product that's branded Energizer). During several incidents where power flicked off and back on, the Energized failed to even preserve power. This morning a lightning storm knocked out my Samsung SyncMaster 170MP even though the Energizer was supposed to be covering it! After this, the unit still responds to USB monitoring and passes power through fine, it just doesn't protect anything. Energizer wants me to ship their unit to them, AT MY EXPENSE, before they'll even respond to the claim. You can be sure I won't buy as much as a watch battery from this company again.I have an APC UPS unit covering my server, and it has never failed for a second during any incident, and I bought it the same day I bought the Energizer for my PC."
1,Simply Awful,"If anyone is still selling this...STAY AWAY.I agree with the above reviews, at least I could usethe battery in an older APC unit."
5,An incredible journey into your own soul,"This recording has the power to transform your life, perception, and experience of music. The delicately intowoven rythyms sooth and tug on the soul. It's as if Shankar can choose to play your heartstrings instead of the violin's. Shankar has total mastery over his chosen instrument. Ultimately, all I can say is that you must experience it for yourself. Truly a moving, intense saga of experience."
5,Excellent!,"This is one album, even after 10 years of its first recording, the music sound ever so fresh and crisp. Is it the beauty of Indian Music or Shankar's artistry or both? definite yes for even the curious international listener."
1,WHAT HAPPEND WITH ???,"this product does NOT arrive yet to me,i'm very upset,my money it's taken but the product does NOT arrived!! SO WHAT HAPPEND WITH IT? THEY HAVE REALLY SEND IT TO ME OR NOT? the product it's really nice 5stars, i like it a lot,...but I dont have it because of them!"
4,Phantom II trucks,"These are strong, relatively light trucks, I skate every day and hours on the weekends, and trick over big stairs, drops and gaps, these have withstood the test. The bushings sucked though that they came with. I had to replace them the first day I skated them."
1,Safety Concern on otherwise nice blankie,"Okay, so at first this blanket seems perfect. It's a great size, lovely fabric ... and just about suffocated my 5 month old baby. Thankfully I was just on the other side of the room. He had pulled it over his mouth and apparently breathed in and because this is backed in the silky fabric -- it's not breathable and just sucked further into his mouth. I heard his gasping and rushed over to pull it off.I can't in good conscience leave his with it anymore. The silk should only be put on the edging -- not the backing. Kids put things in their mouth and over their heads. It's what they do. The fabric needs to be breathable."
5,wanna learn about od read this..,my teacher said that it is liken reading the bible if you wanna learn about jesus so if you want ot learn about od this is the book to read
5,Amazon purchase,"I have not had a chance to read through this book yet, but my purchase through Amazon.com was easy, the book looked better than I expected, the sellers details and ratings affected my choice and was well worth it! Saved $ and received a book that looks like new. I look forward to reading it (after I finish a few others I have purchased and am reading now)."
3,"Consulting Process, NOT Process Consulting","Just to clarify, this is a book on the consulting process, not a book about process consulting. The title and description of the book are misleading. Consulting Process (this book) discusses how to go about the activities of consulting, while Process Consulting is the field of consulting covering business process analysis and design."
3,just straight pipe it,"Its not a catback its just a muffler that goes on the midpipe. DO NOT get this if your truck is single cab. The midpipe will not allow the rest of the exhaust to fit. I took the midmuffler pip thing out and it all sat wonderfully but would not line up with my exhaust hangers. about 2 inches off. I'm not going to cut it or anything. Best if I just pay someone to weld new exhaust hangers in for me but still, Better off just buying the 50 dollar straight pipe they sell. Dont waste your money"
5,Daughter loves them!,My 7 year old loves these. She uses the box to make patterns all the time and it keeps her busy for hours.
1,wrong description,"I bought these sway bar bushings for my 1999 Toyota Camry and they are the wrong size, the length if them are to long. I did not find out until i took the old ones out. Not sure how to return them......recommend that you buy them from a local auto parts dealer."
1,The worst movie ever!,"Okay, where to begin! The memories I cherish of this insult to cinema (not to mention Japanese Anime) are vague impressions of horror and disgust. I was not very frightened by the parts that were supposed to be dramatic, even though these should not be viewed by young children, but by the overall mental deadness and bleakness of the film. You go away feeling that the world is a cold and evil place, and I all but shivered in my bed afterwards. After 90 minuites of violence and death in a bleak, cold amphibian world, I took one look at the repulsive cover and realised that it was created as a warning by some well intentioned graphic designer who wished to warn people away from this movie. do not waste your money! Warn the rest away before it is too late!"
1,Yuck,About the only thing I remember about this movie is that when we rented it my brother (5) and I (8) both disliked it. My parents agreed that it was awful so we rented something else. Don't recommend it especially for $50! But if you were going to buy the VHS I suggest watching it on Youtube first.
2,Warning! Warning! Violent moive alert your kids are in danger!,Parents do not buy your kids this movie! I first got this movie when I was little and when I watched it it was violent from the start when the tadpoles were being eaten by those monsters. Also another shocking scene in the movie was when the big brown frog grabbed the little green frog by his suspenders and started slapping him in the face. The green frog's cries in pain broke me down and even more horrifying scenes are in the movie. Parents if don't want to corrupt your kids forever don't get this movie for them it might even corrupt you! Go ahead and buy it if you want to but don't say I didn't warn you!'_'
4,Not what I expected,"I took a chance on this album only because it was in my ""others have also bought..."" list. To say I was pleasantly surprised is putting it mild. I dig rythmn-n-blues type heavy metal/hard rock and Hydrogyn delivers. And though not a great original song, their cover of ""18 And Life"" plays better than the original."
1,Bombshell Was a Dud,Never got the CD. The Vender never shipped the item so I stoped the order. Don't buy anything from these jokers.
1,>>'What is it about female fronted metal bands that make them so appealing?',"first, there is something called a DICTIONARY-the word is spelled APPALLING-check it out some time;but wait-hold on-dont tell me! I know it....uhm..........is it because she has her nicely shaped b**bs hanging out for all to see...?thats it-I KNEW IT! hah!"
5,want to familiarize with spectral?,"this is a great way to do so. spectral is an offshoot of ghostly international, one of the best us based labels for quality electronic music. spectral gets into the housier side of ghostly and features some excellent artists, including matthew dear, broker/dealer, and many other great talents. this cd is fantastic, a superb collection of older and newer ghostly (future) classics. if the excellent first disc wasnt enough, ryan eliotts megamix is worth the price of admission alone, tearing through 33 tracks in just over an hour. immense. happy 25 indeed!"
4,I love it.,"After using my Palm III for approximately 1 year, I can't live without it. It is great for keeping your calander ( I don't even refer to a paper calander anymore ) and name, address, telephone,e-mail, etc. directory. The only major negative is that the screen is very difficult to read under certain light conditions. I don't know why 3Com doesn't focus on this problem. I would recommend that anyone thinking of buying this product be sure and shop the price on the web, as prices can vary a great deal. Also, consider your price after factoring in shipping and sales tax. Some vendors do not charge sales tax and are more competitive on the shipping charges. Look at the bottom line rather than the stated product price."
4,a good companion,"its lightweight property makes it easy to carry even on field assignments requiring mountain trekking. That is why, palm 3 is a good companion.its sturdy make, affords it to be carried almost in all situations. Easy to access applications further make it more reliable like a good companion.above all, it is affordable."
5,The Palm III rocks!,I bought mine years ago and it's still going strong. You'll have a great PDA even if you buy a used one today.
1,Ancient device/excellent when newer.,"Good device when it was new; now so old that my new Dell computer will not accept down load installation, Have returned product to seller. ."
3,"Ghastly, but better than the alternative","The screen is murky and cramped, and the battery cover tends to rattle around. The Graffiti scrawl is slow and error-prone, much worse than my Newton was at recognizing my normal handwriting. The pen is awkward to extract from the slot, especially if you put the device in any kind of case; and if you don't, expect it to break. The whole thing feels like it came out of a Christmas cracker. It's also lost all my data twice in the last six months.But, thanks to Steve Jobs, the only alternative is Windows CE, and that's even worse. I don't know, maybe I'll try a Palm V; that won't fix the software, but at least it seems like the hardware on the V might be built properly and the screen might be readable."
4,Handy's hardly the word!,"Great product and productivity tool! Birthdays, meetings, phone numbers, everything. Ability to synchronize with calendaring programs is a major plus. Get one!"
2,"nice, but","a generally nice product, but let me take issue with one thing i've seen no one else mention: the software. it's economical and fast, but it just won't do a few things i need an organizer's software to do. i need to keep some long lists in my organizer -- of books to read, reference sources, etc. the palm's ""memo"" software doesn't allow notes to be that long. i also need to be able to put my contacts in a variety of categories. the palm doesn't permit that. if someone is a friend, who's a computer journalist who lives in california, i need to be able to categorize that person under all of these categories: ""friend"", ""computers"", ""journalist"" and ""california."" you can't do that with a palm, which permits only 15 categories to choose from (far from enough), and only one category to be assigned to each contact. to me, that's a significant design flaw, and enough to make me give up using the device."
2,No wonder they dont make these anymore,"Palm III has been surpassed by the IIIx, the V, and the new VII. Maybe these newer models will give users a better reason to buy.Green screen makes it difficult to read and its stodgy design is outdated.Palm III has a rudimentary database (i.e., Phone Book), it is not completely customizable by the user to have its own fields and data types. They do not offer any extendedmemory in the 8 Meg range or above, why. I found technical support lacking is support of my question keeping me on line for extensive periods of time.Save your money for a better product."
2,I continue to be disappointed.,"I am on my 4th Palm Polit...keep upgrading hoping for a better unit but it keeps crashing...batteries are ""eaten alive'...went to Europe last week without my computer...hoped my Palm would be helpful....lost everything before I got onthe plane....2400 names and addresses plus all my appointments...travel with backup...lucky me."
3,Diluted Marxian Madness,"For all of its classic comedy, ""A Day at the Races"" (1937) signals the beginning of the Marx Brothers' creative decline after the death of producer Irving Thalberg. What clicked in ""A Night at the Opera"" doesn't gel nearly as well in this uneven MGM production. Running almost two hours, ""A Day at the Races"" suffers from excessive musical numbers and subplots that dilute some of the Marxes' best material. This film cries for some major editing - preferably a deletion of the ""Water Carnival"" ballet and the ludicrous ""All God's Children Got Rhythm"" number. If Thalberg had lived, ""A Day at the Races"" might have been a worthy follow-up to ""A Night at the Opera."" Instead, the brilliance of Groucho, Chico and particularly Harpo is undermined by obvious studio tampering."
4,One of the most original and funny comedies ever made!,"The best and most famous comedy team (acclaimed by AFI), the Marx brothers are at it again in their fabulous pre-WWII comedy. With Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Alan Jones, this movie is the best comedy of the late '30's. Groucho plays a horse doctor who is called upon to serve at a sanitorium to help an ""ailing"" rich woman. Harpo and Chico are the two jockeys of a poor quality horse at a racing circuit. This movie's comedic originality helps to make this one of the funniest Marx brother movies. This video shouldn't go unoticed in any comedy lovers collection. Buy this movie today and have it be proclaimed on of the best classical comedy movies ever made. Buy it today!!!!!!!!!"
4,The third best Marx Brothers film,"Sam Wood did a good job directing this film. The dvd quality is gorgeous. It was nice to have so many different sets, indoors and outdoors, that made it more interesting. The dialogue scenes are as funny as they can be. The singing and dancing parts I usually fast forward them, and the plot holds well. Recommended."
4,One of their best,"Not as packed with routines as A Night at The Opera, but up there with their top films. With The Coconuts and Duck Soup, it completes a Marx Brothers collection."
5,A Day at the Races 1937,"Some of the trio's funniest set piece . The Comedy content is sensational . The Marxes skewer medicine and bring home a racetrack winner in the hilarious A DAY AT THE RACES. In his favorite role , Groucho is Dr. Hugu Z. Hackenbush - MD , PhD , RFD , MC , PDQ , BYOD and one of the above -dispensing horse pills and quips with equal glee . Groucho (1890-1977) , Chico (1887-1961) , Harpo (1888-1964) and favorite foil Margaret Dumont 1882-1965 join the fun of throughly thoroughbred comedy . Enjoy tootsie-frootsie ice cream , Dumont's medical exam , Harpo's pretty girl pantomime sketch , wallpaper wackies and wall-to-wall hilarity the marx way .High Quality Transfer . Recommended."
5,An Unforgettable Book,"This is a story about a true hero, one who should have a higher profile in the world. Helen Bamber was an unknown figure to me when I first opened this book, but I finished it in awe and reverence. I found it very well written, and filled with stories and people that you will never forget. And you learn that, yes, one person can make a difference in this world. Highly recommended."
1,Very Disappointed,I have many problems with this book. First it is not a reprint of a old book but a photocopy of the book. It is hard to read the text. The original book had some color photos but in this photocopy those photos are missing. Imagine in a book about matching color and grain patterns with no photos.
1,Flew off after 1 month,Item flew off car after being on for less than 1 month. At least the previous magnet that I had was stolen. Complete waste of money.
5,Great Series!,Black Cat came as a huge surprise for me! I had just finished watching Deathnote and was in search of something new when I stumbled upon this... I figured I'd give it a try and boy was I glad I did... The storyline has several great plot turns and the humor is top notch! Overall one of the best series I've ever seen!
1,Dull,"I don't know where to start with this, the characters lacked depth therefore there not really likeable, folding over into corny substandard ""ness"" .the story had a bad game-like design stumbling over itself the animation was lazy really really lazy you think you about to see a great battle (i.e., Dragon ball Z, Samurai 7 Narito Hellsing Batman) but you end up with stills even the mouths of the characters don't move all the time when they talk, really save you money this is not worth a single view. I'm going to destroy mine just so there will be one less copy in the world giving anime a bad name."
3,Hmm,"Produced by Peter Columbus (CHANTAL, CONNIE FRANCIS, FAIR CONTROL, FRANCESCO NAPOLI, de HOEHNER, JENNIFER RUSH, KLAUS DENSOW, MICHAEL MORGAN, P.M. SAMPSON, REX GILDO, ROLAND KAISER, SARAGOSSA BAND)."
3,In the eye of the beholder.,"I bought this based on rave reviews of the pictures in this book. From my eyes, some were great, some were not so great and some were ok. I have other photo books like the ones National Geographic puts out. This book seemed a notch below. I am a little puzzled because Lonely Planet had a photo contest over a year ago and they had a mosaic of the pictures submitted from all over the world from amateur photographers and professional photographers. There were some excellent pictures! Why the disconnect? Maybe someone needs to go re look at those photos and come up with the best of the best from that contest...I would buy!"
3,Meh,"It was not what I expected and it is very dry... I guess all music theory is dry. But this book just seems to kill it for me. I don't know how to explain it I guess. I'd recommend going to a store and flipping through it first to see if you would like it, I only got it because someone had it on a list that had other good books."
3,OK... but...,"I find this book/CD set to be ok. However, it is a bit vague at times and lacks detail in some areas to the point where I found myself having to search the internet for more in depth explanations... for example.. Ties and Slurs. Also, I'm not sure if I just got a bad copy or if this common but the binding of the book seems poor. The pages began falling out after only 2 days of normal use.Otherwise, I do find myself learning from the content."
4,Good workbook-style resource,"I wrote a review of this and several other books for an upcoming article in Classical Singer Magazine. This is a good workbook-style resource for getting a headstart on your theory; goes from basic to early advanced topics. The only thing I would have liked to see in it was more composition exercises, but that's my bias as a composer."
4,Textbook for music Class,"I use this book for a textbook at a local college, and we had to purcjase as a requirementto take the course.I do find it somewhat hard to understand, and a more detailed discussion of each section would be better. Parts are difficult to understand, but since we had to have this book for a class, I had to purchase it."
3,sexy but painful,"my husband bought this for me and i was so thrilled because i loved the sexy look. however, when i wore them for a day, my feet ached so much. i don't know maybe it's because of the shape of the shoes and the insides of the zippers kept on rubbing against my skin. i'm still using the shoes but not as often as i would want to."
3,Right Boot - Right Price,I always wear high heels and I was searching for a nice high heel boot. This boot is comfortable and yet fashionable for jeans as well as dress pants. One can never go wrong with the dynamic duo of Nine West and Amazon.com.
3,Style - YES! Leather quality - NO!,"The GOOR boots are fantastic - I love my black leather ones. Even though the heel is very high, they are balanced perfectly, at least for me. I've been eyeing these patent leather babies for a while, but when I finally got them, I was disappointed by the look of the leather. It is wrinkled (unevenly) and there was a weird twist to it, literally, as if someone torqued it 90 degrees. Sent them back. :("
5,Soooo sexy,I ordered these boots in wine. I was unsure about the color because the picture looked shiny patent leather. When I got them they are a gorgeous wine/brown hue that will go with everything. They are sexy and while high they are easy to walk in and so comfortable. The leather is so soft. I feel like I stole them because I paid less than $33.00 for them on sale. Thanks Amazon.
4,"beautiful, sexy musical journey","This is truly one of Rasa Mello's best....it's like taking a transcendant journey which elevates you into a beautiful and exotic place. Chill, lounge, mello = relaxing and sexy vibe."
5,Historical fiction that will strengthen your faith,"If you like historical fiction that will strengthen you in your faith, ONLY GLORY AWAITS is for you. Well researched and engaging from the very first page, this story of a Reformation martyr will strengthen your own resolve to stand firm in the faith. Young Anne Askew comes to faith as the Protestant Reformation begins to sweep through sixteenth-century England, and is immediately swept into the danger and tumult of that time. As her faith is tested, she deepens in her convictions, which in turn draws her into a deeper and deeper testing of her faith. I found myself wanting to encourage Anne through her trials, but instead found my own faith encouraged by her boldness and perseverance. In the present day, when Christian views are increasingly being viewed with animosity, this book will not only entertain you, but will provide encouragement for you also to stand firm."
5,demanding yet entertaining,"I picked up The Impossibly after a review in Time Out New York called it a combination of Robbe-Grillet and Beckett, two of my favorite authors. I can see where the comparison came from, but I don't think it's very accurate. If anything, the novel reads like Kafka as if written by Donald Barthelme - obscure and frustrating, yet written in a breezy ironic style. The review from Publishers Weekly complains that ""the absence of plot make[s] this a difficult, frustrating read,"" but the same criticism could also be lobbed at any of the other authors above, and it misses the point - The Impossibly is not supposed to be a Bildungsroman, its difficulties are intentional. And it's worth the effort - the book is intelligent, funny, and beautifully written."
2,"Good concept, poor quality","I wouuld love to give this product a better review, however I ordered two of these at the same time, and both had leaks in them. One has a leak in the lid at the seam, and the other has a leak in the side wall. I still was able to use both of them as they float fine, but the capacity was cut down and the appearance was poor with a half deflated cooler floating along. I have many of the Intex tubes and they are nothing shy of awesome, so you can imagine my disappointment from these."
3,Does not sound like My Little Pony,"Let me begin by saying DD loves this double disc. My disaapointment was thinking the singers would sound like the ponies she is use to seeing on her dvd's. The voices are very adultlike nothing at all like the hi-pitched Minty, and the My LP gang. It was well worth the price, and again my 3 year old loves the tranquil songs, it just wasn't what I was shopping for."
3,How am I supposed to use it?,"Edited:I also used for kicking. It was test for my hand skin.Original:I purchased that to practice punching. But it is very uncomfortable for punches, especially with hands. If I connect with the shield, it hurts bearer's hands and body. Probably I tried to use that in a wrong way. That is why gave 3 stars instead of 1."
4,lipozyne,I started taking these last week. I have already lost 3 pounds. What I like about these pills is I don't get hungry and I don't get the jitters like I did with a prescription diet pill.
3,DIET ASSISTANCE,I DON'T HAVE A LOT TO LOSE JUST WANT TO KEEP THE EXTRA FROM BUILDING UP THIS PRODUCT SEEMS TO HELP JUST TAKE TWO W/MEALS OR WHEN YOU EAT AND I BOUGHT ONE BOTTLE GOT ONE FREE THAT HELPS A LOT HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS LAXATIVE!!,This is a dangerous drug that will mess up your esophagus! I stop taking it 5 days ago and I still can't eat anything or else I'll have to use the restroom. I did lose weight but not by this pill. By being sick to my stomach!
1,So-So,"This book and its companion on the Japanese have been my wishlist. Today I happen to be in the King Library in San Jose and had the opportunity to read/view this book. I found the information to be satisfactory for the layman with little knowledge of the Marine Corps, but not up to a standard acceptable for someone with any depth of knowledge. In addition to the incorrect photo captions I found the information presented lacked depth.I am also a former Marine and a lifelong history lover, well versed in Marine Corps history. Overall I cannot recommend this book."
4,Good product,Found these to be okay 2 way radios. Did have some issues with range and interference even at short distances 200 yards on open ground. Also the stencils wore of quickly.
2,"Mediocre, at best","While researching MURS radios a few years ago, I bought a variety of models, including a pair of these since they had just come onto the market relatively recently.What really irked me the most was that the radio comes with 6 AA NiMH batteries, but they're bottom-of-the-barrel quality batteries (1600mAh?). They don't hold a charge. They get super hot in most rapid chargers. And with the built-in charger, they take forever to charge. (12 hours?)The antenna is detachable, but I'm not sure what kind of replacement you can use with it. The volume control was decent, but everything else about the radio felt kinda shoddy. Even the transmit range of this radio vs. the other MURS radios I have is much worse.The radio hasn't fallen apart on me and it's generally usable, so I can't give it only 1 star. So 2 stars it is."
3,Arrived in used condition,"I just received the handset from the third party seller DollarRite. It arrived on time, but the handset box had been opened, the handset has scratches on it and the AC plug was sloppily re-wrapped. The handset was obviously used and re-packaged, which was very disapponting since I was purchasing a product listed as NEW. I have yet to hook it up and make sure it works properly since I am waiting for the base station from a different seller."
5,"If there has to be a best ""Krautrock"" album, this is it","The second part of the second song on this album contains a slowly building jam that is the best piece of rock-based music I've ever heard. And the rest isn't too shabby either (just basically six meditations on Black Sabbath's ""Planet Caravan""). A quiet, peaceful, piano tinkling, bongo slapping, acoustic strumming mindblower, THE downer rock album of all time."
2,A great garage stoner session,"2 1/2Any magic found on this minor psychedelic excursion sounds like it came about on accident. The album is not without a few impassioned sections of unhinged acoustic jamming, but sounds mostly like a sloppy and muddled mess of mediocre musicality."
5,WELL VERSED,Well thought out and practical. Only problem is is it all still applicable in this new economy we are in now.
5,I love this dustpan set,"I had one of these and it disappeared when I was having some work done on my kitchen. The shape is perfect, many of the dustpans out there are not shaped for utility. The brush is just right, not too floppy or stiff, and it's easy to clean too. I don't care what color it is, it's in the cupboard. I'm ordering another one and wondering if I ought to get 2 just in case someone else decides they like it too."
2,Not what I expected,"From the description and other reviews, I thought this would be a large, rather strong dustpan. Wrong - on both counts. The brush was the best part of the deal and was probably worth the cost of the set all by itself. I would not buy this item again unless I wanted it just for the brush."
3,picture's not me,Was not the item that was pictured when I ordered it. I was looking for a larger dust pan. Oh well guess I will just have to keep the piles small.
1,You get what you pay for - sort of...,"Ordered in black, sent royal blue. No idea why. Too inexpensive to waste time gettingan address, making a label, packaging & returning. But this doesn't say much for yourshipping dept.It's a cheap, slightly flexible pan too. The brush seems more of a functional tool thanthe colored toy that is the dustpan. If it snaps or other flaws reveal themselves willupdate this first impression.I'd wager you can get something similar at your local dollar store, and you might evenget the color you want."
3,Street Arabic,I found the paperback version interesting but at the same time a bit hard to understand fully. Without the cassetts with the correct pronunciation its hard follow this book. I have on the other hand been studiyng classic arabic for some time which have been helpful.Recordings are old and sometimes hard to fully hear the pronunciation.
5,My boss can't live without it,"I have seen my boss use many different products to keep track of things. I have used some of them myself, but the Palm Pilot is the best thing since the invention of white bread. It holds addresses, names, appointments, reminders, lists, you name it and it is download/uploadable to your pc. What could be better? My boss is planning on getting them for each of us."
4,good size but difficult data entry,"Everyone knows the Pilot is a wonderful take-along source for retrieving data. For a one-way device it's fine. The ""graffiti"" handwriting recognition takes some getting used to, and most difficult for left handers. Almost impossible to take notes in a meeting because it's so slow. Data entry is best done from your PC/Mac, not from it's screen. You owe it to yourself to check out the Psion Series 5."
2,A bargain isn't always a bargain,"Added to the original amount I paid for this organizer, I would have to buy additional things to make it work the way it should. This was not worth it. I could have bought a new one and gotten what I wanted."
3,"The Palm One Palm Pilot Meets my needs, but not completely.","I knew that it was a new item, but I did not realize that it was for professional use, and that it was put on the market in 1997. As a result I have not been able to get the newer version of Palm Desktop for my computer successfully installed in order to use the Hot sync Setup. But I am able to use the Palm Pilot as it is without any connection to the computer."
2,outdated,"Ok I new that and bought it anyway otherwise one star. The problem is its so hard to use. Devises like this have undergone so many inprovements I cant begin to tell you how poor this is in 2012. Don't buy it, don't take it for free."
3,Bought it for the hubbie,"This one was for my husband since his Visor brand did not work. He wanted something to help him organize his schedule better but he said it was too big for him (not slim enough). So, not sure where he put it now and he may have given it to our kids for playing purposes."
3,At times great at other ...,"Let me lead off by saying I enjoyed the book. Now the proverbial but. Att imes the descriptive style of the author wore me down. I found myself skimming ahead to where the story started again. Then for all the excess verbage the ending seemed rushed. I would have liked to seen less meaningless description throughout and more on the fate of the cast, especially Conrad. What happened between him and his family?Not a bad read, but there is better out there."
2,overwritten mess,"As a huge fan of Tom Wolfe and an Atlantan, I am sad to report that this book is pointless, overwritten and lacking virtually any plot. After 500 plus pages of character development, we finally get to what passes for action. The problem is, you don't really care what happens to anyone and you know Wolfe can't possibly wrap this up in the final 200 pages. And he doesn't. He needs an epilogue for that. Did no editor dare tell the emperor he has no clothes? This is not to say there aren't passages of great Tom Wolfe writing, particularly when he delves into the life of his main character Charlie Croker. But please, Mr. Wolfe...you don't need to impress us with how much you learned driving around Atlanta neighborhoods."
4,"A slow start, but then hold on for a wild ride!","I usually have a hard time with books in which there are lots of ""main"" characters, but Tom Wolfe has a way of fleshing each of the people out to the point where I can visualize them, down to facial expressions.For anyone who has aspired to ride some scheme to financial riches, you're going to see a bit of yourself in this book, and maybe wince once or twice. I did, anyway. Likewise, the power brokers and poverty peddlers will find themselves skewered as well.All in all, an incredibly satisfying story. I put down the book comfortable that the cosmic scales of justice had balanced themselves nicely.The last 200 pages or so (of the hardcover) simply cannot be put down. I rarely find myself so completely hooked in a story, as I was when I found the wild arrangement of sub-plots finally tying into a perfect weave. Mr. Wolfe deserves congrats for this one."
4,Enjoyable Read Except for the Ending,"I really enjoyed reading 7/8 of this book. I was interested in the characters, and all of the stories were compelling, although Mr. Wolfe's editor should have been more strict with him. (That symphony scene was painful to read!).All in all, though, the end was really a letdown! I couldn't believe I had just forged through 700+ pages, only to have all of the stories summed up in a short discussion by two of the characters. Wolfe totally dropped the ball on some of the plot lines. We never learn what happens to Serena, Harry Zale, Herb Richman, Conrad's family, Peepgass's paternity suit, Croker's son, Wallace, Elizabeth Armholster, etc. I was totally disappointed by these oversights as a result of the rushed ending.What happened? Was there a deadline that had to be met? Did Wolfe break his arm? Inquiring minds want to know...."
2,Wanted : Editor for Famous Former Journalist,"Oh dear. This book provides indisputable evidence that once you become a Famous American Writer, no editor will dare to tell you when your writing stops being witty and perceptive and becomes instead a tedious, self-indulgent bore. No doubt Wolfe-as-reporter benefited mightily from the editor's pencil and A Man in (Very)Full shows all too clearly that Wolfe-as-novelist has retained this need. Repetitive, fetishistically obsessed with items of clothing, and badly paced, the book nonetheless still contains enough stunning passages to show what might have been. Finally, as others have already pointed out, the ending is a brutally incompetent disaster, a garbled summing up of the characters' fate. Presumably by this stage the author had had enough of his characters and their story, a sentiment many readers will have come to share."
3,What was up with that ending???,"As expected the author weaves a good story that I thoroughly enjoyed. Then, inexplicably, he ends it in the most expedient and disappointing way imaginable. It's as though his publisher gave him a limit on the number of pages he could write."
5,"AWESOME, BABY! AWESOME!","Simply: The book's ending leaves you glad you read the book. While the book is quite interesting most of the way through, the conclusion was even better."
2,742 pages of disappointment...,"As a current resident of Atlanta, I both loved and hated the detailed description Wolfe gave of my city, its culture and politics. He dug deep to see the beauty and ugliness of my home, which, while often on target, made me uncomfortable at times. That's one reason why I like to read Wolfe's work. BUT, I have to say reading this book was an arduous task. Too much character development, not enough story. I was determined to finish all 742 pages, only to feel cheated at the end, wondering why in the world I wasted my time. My anticipation will surely be tempered for his next piece of work."
3,Wolf quits @ the end!,"Great writing, full of detail and interesting ancedotes on Atlanta and it history and culture, (very Michneresque) About 3/4 of the way through I think Toms, Mom called in in for dinner so the ending was rushed, light and totally unfulfilling. This could have been a great novel and someone should finish it properly."
3,Mediocre Wolfe,"Some of the professional reviews I read compared AMIF with Dickens or proclaimed ""an impossibly smart"" book. It is neither, unless you want Dickens for the T.V. generation. The book requires persistence until about page 440, then it gains momentum, making you hang on for the ultimately disappointing finish. Wolfe did some good local research, but his attempt to re-create south Georgia dialect is clumsy, and his characters are on the whole not believable or very interesting. The end panders to our desire for a happy ending, but comes off as totally unjust and unrealistic."
2,This one was half full,"Maybe I missed the genius here, but this book kept going and going and nothing seemed to be happening. The ending was very unsatisfying. You don't even like any of the characters. Should have called it quits after a few chapters. Having never read any Tom Wolfe novels before, this is likely my one and only Wolf read. Nuf sed."
2,shakespeare?,"Interesting here the wide variance of praise and scorn. I'm on the ""thumbs down"" side; just short of throwing Wolfe to the lions though. On the positive side this book entertains and keeps your attention with a gripping interesting, if somewhat warped storyline. On the other hand we also have here juvenile writing (Roger Too White); a plot too often upset by unfathomable contrivance (the earthquake); and page after page of descriptions of inanimate objects. I would like to present a reading list to those of you who gave this book 5 stars, but I will muffle at this point."
2,A man in full try's the patience and the sensibilities,"please, someone, anyone explain to me what this book is trying to say. please help me understand why wolfe uses 120 words to say what could be said in only 50. please help me understand why sick, vicious profanity and poorly crafted racial stereotypes is hip. please help me understand how i can indentify, revile or at least give a hoot what happens to his thinly crafted characters. and please, oh please, help me find the passages as ""beautiful as any ever written""this book is a waste of time."
3,"Good if you like Wolfe, terrible ending","If you like the way Wolfe writes, you like his characters and his style, then you'll enjoy this book as you read it. But I was *really* disappointed in the ending. It seems like all the characters are going to come together in a terrific ending, and...... >poof< it finished with a whimper. Very disappointing."
1,Made-for-TV Soap Opera,"Aside from the fact that I found several grossly eroneous editing errors, I found ""A Man in Full"" to not be worth the paper it's printed on. (And, by the way, it could easily be half the paper.) The characters were unlikeable, unbelievable, and flat. The plot was base and trivial. The climax was ridiculous. Burning this book would not be a bad option."
5,Sometimes better than Bonfire; Others not,"This farce is a real corker! Charlie Croker exists is every city in the USA! Wolfe again captures the male ego. This flight of fancy is the bomb. If you take out the unbelievably horrible ending to the book and replace it with another, it becomes this century's epic. Let us just hope that the now 68 year old Wolfe is not too old to produce another novel."
2,a towering tower of a tale,"742 pages of edifice, hiding the fact that all characters but two are superfluous, and those two come together in a most unconvincing way, to a dopey climax of miniscule proportions. Wolfe is good at language -- jail/street talk, southern patois, lovingly described architecture, sartorial detail, interior decorating; but his characters leave you unmoved. He seems obsessed with getting old -- at 60. He describes all women in purely sexual terms. His book is hollow and fundamentally dull."
2,Arrogant,"It was with great anticipation that I purchased T. Wolfe's ""A Man In Full"". It was with disappointment that I put it down upon completion. For an author that refuses to acknowledge the existence of contemporaries in the genre of ""journalistic literature"" he would be well advised to have a look at Delillo. Such arrogance is amusing in the twilight of a career but not at the obvious end."
5,Could have saved 200 Pages and created a better ending.,Nothing like spending 700 pages on much unneeded narrative and then rushing to the conclusion because the book is too long. Not a likeable character in the book. Can anyone explain Page 228. The Cup trick performed on Charlie by his then mistress.Bonfire was great book and lousy movie. Maybe this will be lousy book and good movie.
2,Ending killed the book.,The author spends hundreds of pages developing the characters that a reader might care about and then massacres the plot in the last chapters.
2,The Dark Side of Wolfe,"Tom Wolfe had always been on a pedastal for me--I read in awe of his way of writing. ""A Man In Full,"" however, really changed that. Wolfe still has a magic with words and can be a quality writer, but...it is darker than anything else I've read by him, especially ""Bonfire of the Vanities."" It also took a long time to get interested in the story. So, as a warning to others, there are graphic Wolfe-isms of horses mating with a little help from their handlers, and jailhouse sex, body fluids, and violence. For me, the story itself could not withstand that, so I stopped reading about 2/3 through--it just wasn't that good."
2,A great work with a lousy ending,"It is hard for me to remember another work that has captivated me such as A Man in Full has. It was a wonderful read full of excellent detail. However, the detail seemed to end before the story did. The end of the book is a severe and quick. I wonder to myself how such a great book could have ended in such a abrupt way. This could have been one of the great works of our time, but alas the ending destroys the entire work."
2,Turgid and tough going,"I bought this book out of curiosity about the ""movers and shakers"" of the real estate industry. I know there have been obscene amounts of money made there, and I was interested in getting an insider's look, as I know Tom Wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates. However, as a novel, the book doesn't really work - it's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of self-awareness. Frankly, I couldn't even finish it."
1,"What happened to the ending, Mr. Wolfe?","This is a another well-written book with wonderful character development and a very engaging multitude of story-lines, BUT WITHOUT AN ENDING! I loved 3/4 of the read and I was furious to find that, after 750 pages, the story (or stories) go nowhere! And, Wolfe finishes with a minor character - what happened to the lead man? All I can say is it looks like Wolfe fell asleep at the wheel. I would only recommend this book if you have nothing else to read."
2,Very Disappointed,"I agree with the reviewer who concluded that all he had lost was his time.Some individual sentences ,paragraphs,and yes,even a few chapters were captivating,but all in all it was an extremely long waste of my time."
3,Master formula novel (or script) but not a master work,"This was my first Tom Wolfe novel. Having just moved to Atlanta, I thought it would be fun reading. Overall, this book was an inflight novel, an international flight with some gate changes. AMIF was cleanly written and well researched with all the mainstay formula items that one should expect from a book for the movies. AMIF was not a captivating or an engaging work. The reader should not expect true literature from AMIF, but should find a professional effort. I doubt I will ever want to reread it, but I did not mind the first read (except in a few sections)."
2,long-winded and boring,"I read the first half of this novel and promptly stopped. I found the characterization too detailed which made the reading long-winded. Having spent a great deal of time in Georgia, I was familiar with the setting, yet it did not add to my enjoyment of this book."
3,A Man In Full Is A Book Not Finished,"An enjoyable page-turner, but so similar in style to Bonfire that you often feel as if you've read parts of it before. The high point is the cast of over-the-top yet entertaining characters; the low point is the disappointing finish. After 700 pages of complex, converging antics -- which gives it some of the flavor of Vonnegut's Breakfast Of Champions -- I expected a bit more than a few paragraphs of ""what they are doing now"" after a less-than-dramatic final scene. It seemed as if Wolfe just ran out of gas at the end, and wrapped it up as quickly as he could to make a deadline."
2,Zeus' spark? I think not.,"Yes, this book does bring situations and people together through excellent plot twists, but why? If all Conrad is going to do to the hopeless Croker is convert him to stoicism, I don't care. 730 pages of page turning dialogue and complex situations to have the whole book come down to some long forgotten philosophy. I also wonder why Roger White and Wes Jordan have to have a ten page conversation to let the reader know what could have been said (should have) in the previous 730 pages! Five star start, one star ending."
3,"A great read, but loses it at the end.","This is a well written book, with interwoven stories and characters who are real - until the last fifty pages, when the whole book falls apart, under the weight of its own incredible resolution. It's as if the author gave up on the story and just wanted to finish this very wordy disappointment."
3,"First 650 pages great,terrible conclusion!","The first 80% of this book was outsatanding eith the exception of trying to understand the language of 5-0.The characters developed well and it was quite easy to develop strong feelings(both good and bad) about all the major characters.Several of the scenes;the plantation,the workout session,horse breeding,prison life;literally jumped off the pages at me.They were quite vivid and believable. However,the ending leaves the reader unfulfilled and does not continue with the intensity or emotion of the earlier parts of the story.I guess writing a 700+ page novel was too draining for the author who must have said ""Now that I've exhausted myself by creating all these wonderful and interesting characters,placed them in a late 20th century pressure cooker,I'm too tired to finish so I'll get the third grade class at PS # 32 to write the last 75 pages."""
3,"enjoyable, but...","First 500 pages were great, but then TW must have realized that it'd take another 1000 pages to finish it in the same style and tempo. From page 500 onwards it is a down hill spiral, and a let down. Terrific passages make the book worth reading, but more was expected like some climax or coherent end."
3,"Unfortunately, captured the true essence of Atlanta, !!!","I am a native Atlantan and though the book is not being well recieved here, I wonder why?, if the shoe fits wear it!!! Well it fits all to well, from the politics, to the racial overtones, to the ""Buckhead Betty's"" and coporate Atlanta. I enjoyed the book, but it did not keep me up nights reading it. Mr. Wolfe can be somewhat verbose and the ending was very disappointing..."
5,"Well done Author Wolfe...Bravo and Kudos to a ""Book in Full""","What more can be said? Wolfe has done it again. This time he has described the Atlanta scene of the rich and powerful. Now that I have finished reading the book, I already miss the characters. Perhaps Mr. Wolfe could set a ""bon"" fire under the movie studios to get the book to screen....quick. Nicholson no doubt.... as the lead character. Matt Damon as the young convict. Nicole Kidman as the wife...Would make a wicked script. Worth a read. Even General Sherman would have taken the time from setting flames to Atlanta to read this one. Well done Mr. Wolfe...worth the wait."
2,Not Impressive,"Almost 800 pages, this story is dramatically over-developed in some areas, woefully under-developed in others and at the end of the book, things just end. It's almost as if Mr. Wolfe's publisher said ""Enough already! We have too many pages to print as it is!"". Before I read this book, I was considering buying his other books...no more."
4,Amazon purchase saves 30% on 70% of a novel.,"The 30% savings via Amazon compensates for the last 200 pages where Wolfe puts forth 70% effort. It is as if Wolfe had to go to the bathroom, but his publisher would not let him leave the typewriter until the novel was finished. Please let us have an ending as well thought out as the majority of the book, or just have Wolfe stop in midsentence on page 502 and type ""GOOD GOD THATS ENOUGH"". ""In Full"" is a page turner, but the plodding, muddled end smacks of a 15 year old on his first date who suddenly finds himself ""on third base"", nervously sweating the question ""Now what am I supposed to do?"""
2,Disappointing - a testament to powerful book PR machines!,"Wolfe attempted to write the novel capturing the mood of the 90's, but perhaps his own lack of writing depth best exemplified the shallowness of this past decade. Wolfe's strength is his power of observation and conveying this in words. The book is strongest in these short moments: dinner at the Plantation, Conrad in jail, etc. However, the rest of the book never gets rolling and never engages the reader. Crocker's dilemma is hardly a situation on which to rest a 700-page novel. And if the book was less a comment on today's society, but a vignette to demonstrate the principles of Stoicism, it failed as well. The salty air of the Hamptons and heat of the Georgia summer must have gotten to Tom. Having enjoyed Wolfe's work in the past, I only hope this is not his last."
5,"A sweeping, satirical look at late 20th life in U.S.","This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I've read many of them. Through characters that span the spectrum of American life, Wolfe explpores the moral/spiritual gaps that develop in a society with so much wealth, freedoms and opportunities. As the story develops, those that have the most wealth and power become increasing miserable, while a principled young idealist discovers happiness through an ancient spiritual code. This book is significant in that it reaffirms that a spiritual aspect to life is a necessary means to achieving happiness regardless of one's wealth or freedom. Character, it seems, still matters in late 20th century America."
2,A time passer for those with cheap time,"This book is for casual reading only; hardly a literary classic. Often, the writing was plodding and in need of good editing. The plot was hardly epic and the finale was significantly uneven to the rest of the book. At times, Mr. Wolfe seemed clearly out of his element. For those casual critics who felt it deserved a four or five star rating, in time will you be able to quote a life revealing line or turn of a phrase? Was this book really a classic for you or just fun? If you answer ""yes, I can"" and ""a classic"", then put down the Danielle Steele novel you are reading and go to your local library for counseling. This book was written with hopes of a movie deal and not for historical reference."
1,Overblown and overwritten with a totally unbelievable ending,"I should have given up when I found this book absolutely just too heavy to hold, uncomfortable to read in any position. I kept waiting for it to get better but it only got worse. Pages could be skipped with nothing lost. I agree with all who said the ending was a monumental disappointment; it was as if Wolfe couldn't think of what to do with the story he spent ten years creating. I finished it last night and have already forgotten what happened to the main character! And the pompous dedications at the beginning .... please! Next time Wolfe should find a good copy editor. Or maybe just stick to the lecture circuit. P.S. All that excessive translation of the ""lingo""--yet we never know just how ""Croker"" is pronounced!"
2,Once again a story about disfunctional Southerners.,"I was so excited to read this book after all the praise I read but was I ever disappointed. The bottom line - - who cares! The characters were uninteresting and most importantly unsympathetic. They were down right annoying! I didn't want to get to know them or delve futher into their situation.Great dialogue makes for a great book and A Man in Full fully lacked such!Can't believe I even finished it - - but being the frugal person I am had to. I'm not lending this book to any of my friends. I'm marching straight down to the used bookstore to see if I can recoup my ill spent ""investment."" Thank goodness for Amazon.com for making this purchase not as steep as it could have been."
2,great until the incredibly STUPID ending,"This book is entertaining and interesting most of the way through, but then veers off into the most implausible, annoying, and downright dumb ending you may ever come across, with the exception of maybe a comic book or a Star Trek episode. One thing that really, really gets on my nerves is when a writer puts forth a philosophy or a message at the end of a book without bothering to make the rest of the book tie into that philosophy at all. The only thing that bothers me more is when an author spends an entire book developing a character and then to wrap things up has that character do something completely out of personality and context, with no connection at all. Wolfe does both these things. I can only recommend this book with a warning to hold your nose at the end. I think Wolfe himself must have gotten sick and tired of writing the thing, or maybe he had to meet a deadline or something."
2,It was o.k. and that is it!!!,"I keep reading thinking is this it??? I mean over 750 pages and we get to read about lawns compared to a woman's breast. Come on I know I ain't no Frued but really. And the scene of the horse breeding---honey I was raised on a ranch ""a big un"" and we never took our guest out to the barn to veiw ""the breeding"". Turn the book loose Zues and butn the thing. I did like the charactors but noway did I love them. I mean Rodger Too White and Peepgrass did those names just come to you or was it when you were looking at the swelling lawns of a breast."
2,a novel of stereotypes doing stereotypical things.,"The final sentence in the book is: ""I'll be back,"" portending (god forbid)a sequel. I loved Bonfire of the Vanities, and on reading the first chapter of A Man In His Full, I was a bit disquieted, but looked forward to a long read which would sweep me away like Bonfire did. It was certainly a long read but it was disappointing. Even the good chapters such as the dinner party at the quail house proir to which the guests were entertained by the mating of two thoroughbred horses, could have been written better. (I've seen thoroughbreds mate, and some of the more interesting details were omitted.) There were enjoyable parts and several good laughs, but they were scarce. The business dealings were portrayed as being extraordinary, but they were in fact fairly routine. If you're seeking high caliber, fast paced business writing you're better advised to read Barbarians at the Gate. I expected better."
1,Don't succumb to the hype,"Wolfe is a vastly overrated writer, skilled with language but utterly lacking in soul. What I've read of this book confirms for me his utter lack of psychological insight and his heavy-handed approach to writing. Danielle Steele with a haughtily superior attitude."
1,I thought Wolfe was supposed to be this good writer.,"I was under the impression Tom Wolfe was a good writer; indeed, the book was recommended by a friend and Wolfe wrote the popular Bonfire of the Vanities. So I happily shelled out 12 dollars (Cdn) for a little entertainment. It turns out that Wolfe can't write. He's not witty, concise, or funny and in order for him to bring a scene to life he has to resort to pages of tedious description. His characters are implausible and unlikable, and the situations he puts them in are silly. For example, he has a manual labourer look for white collar work which the labourer can't get because labour has made his fingers too big to type. It's not a funny bit and it's not a good metaphor. Distrust anyone who says this is a good book; their taste is suspect. Save your money."
2,Entertaining but lacking,"This book gave observations and insights into different levels of the Atlanta social structure. The novel read easily but never had me thinking beyond superficial levels. The cast of characters is too wide for Wolfe to explore deeply. The novel's faults far outweigh the positive points.What I found particularly bothersome was Wolfe's portrayal of younger generations. He wrote with a woefully misunderstanding tone towards those below college graduation age. He came across as an old cronie. What I also didn't like was his comparisons of young attractive women to 'boys with breasts'. I don't see it that way. My guess is that it is Wolfe's observation about a change in the feminin ideal of beauty from voluptuoust towards slender and athletic (hence scenes in aerobics classes). Once again, this is Wolfe coming across as old.Had the book been a slower more demanding read, I would have closed the book never to finish. The finish was anti-climatic."
5,Wow!,Blows everyone else out of the water. A triumph and tour de force; well deserves its #1 spot at Amazon and on other best seller lists. Buy it! Read it! You will love it!
4,Wonderful characters,"This was my first Tom Wolfe novel, and it's clear in reading Man in Full that Wolfe is the consummate American Contemporary Anthropologist. He dissects, satirizes, and serves up wonderful portraits of various strata of modern American society. Man in Full covers 1) prison culture, 2) ""burn out"" or ""white trash"" culture, 3) young black Atlanta, 4) old Atlanta elite with such keen observation that a reader will never look at the world the same again.That being said, the conclusion of the book is a big let-down after a wonderful run-up. It would appear that Wolfe must have had a hard deadline and had to ""tie-up"" the book without an adequate conclusion to do justice to the wonderful first 7/8ths of the book. I would love to have Wolfe re-write the conclusion, because the first 7/8ths of Man in Full are pure mastery."
5,Triumphant follow-up to Bonfire of the Vanities,"I would not have thought it possible for Tom Wolfe to exceed himself after ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"", but he has come up with another brilliant novel that observes contemporary American culture and human nature with all its foibles and frailties. I'm on my third re-reading of this excellent book. It's so engrossing, I missed my train stop on my way to work."
1,False hope,"This is the best door stop I have ever bought. By weight and volume it is unsurpassed. However, as enjoyable reading it is fleeting at best. Mr. Wolfe has his moments - 742 pages can't be all bad - but in general the book is an incredibly disappointment. My only hope is they don't make a movie of this dribble."
1,A Huge Disappointment on a Wolfeian scale,"As much as I enjoyed Bonfire, which was so engrossing that I knocked it off in a weekend, I could not seem to pick this book up.Riddled with cookie cutter cliches and themes from Bonfire of the Vanities, only Tom Wolfe seems able to create as collosel of a 'repeat' as this. It was like sitting through the entire ""Rocky"" series without an escape.It illustrates the reason I rarely read Pop fiction anymore (the book was a gift)- every book is the same old thing.-Carl Friedrich, Rye, NY"
3,Please explain The Cup routine on Page 228,Am still reading the book but have been stumped by the Cup used by Serena on Charlie on page 228 in hardcover book. My wife and several friends also have no idea of what this is. Can someone explain it to me. Sounds somewhat exciting.Email me if you know what this refers to. Thanks
1,How did this book ever get published?,"This has got to be one of the most ridiculous story lines I have ever picked up. It appears that Wolfe had three or four partial story ideas he had been working on and crammed all of them into this mess, with a forced relationship and interaction. The rendering of the characters is shallow at best and generally unbelievable. Wolfe has given us the deed to this book in lieu of foreclosure because this attempt is intellectually and artistically bankrupt."
1,About as timely as Big Hair and Parachute Pants,"Tom Wolfe's new novel is travesty in a time warp. A novel started 10 years ago should have been finished in two years -- all his premises are now cliched -- who cares!! The average American up on public issues could have written the same plot. Not to mention all the help he credits. 10 years for that! Just typical of a bunch of guys sitting around talking about how great it's going to be. Wolfe attempts to create timeless Shakespearean character(s) but ends with characters and a plot as timely as big hair and parachute pants. John Updike's review, ""...a book that defies you not to buy it,"" is the politically correct review that Tom Wolfe deserves in recognition of his earlier achievements. It's nice to see that there are gentlemen among novelists, I, however, cannot be so kind."
1,I'VE READ TOM WOLFE AND HE'S NO DICKENS,"SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. is it possible to simply get tired of wolfe's literary pyrotechnics? but to call him a modern day Dickens--as some reviewers have--is a travesty. when i think of all the talented fiction writers who never get the hype he does, it is even worse. his constant weaving back and forth made no character coherant for any length of time; his women were all cardboard cut out stereotypes and so much of his observations were about surface attributes or non attributes, such as nymphet abs vs. over-the-hill flab. instead of satire, it sounds like hackneyed thoughts of his own. he should have grown up by now."
1,Don't waste your time,I read the whole book hoping it would get better. Usually I'll read a book quickly but this was a book that was easy to put down. I thought about not finishing it but figured it HAD to get better. I shouldn't have bothered. The ending was horrible and I can't recommend this book at all.
4,An author in full!,"A Man in Full was a delight all the way through. The book may have been 787 pages, but it felt much shorter. Well worth reading. Once again, Tom Wolfe proves to be one of our generation's greatest social satirists. This book is a scathing critisicm of an overdeveloped, overstimulated society. There is hardly a contemporary social issue, be it classism, racism, sports, politics, prisons, gender relations, sex, the media, or religion that he doesn't cover in this book. Wolfe aptly weaves the characters and the story together in a manner that leaves the reader thinking about American culture in new and interesting ways. The ending was a little farfetched, but by no means did that ruin a thoroughly enjoyable and worthwhile novel."
1,What a total disapointment !,"Having been a fan of Tom Wolfe's earlier books, with the exception of Bonfire of the Vanities, I was hopeful that his next book would be better than Bonfire. Well, I was totally wrong. This book suffers from the same problems that Bonfire did, totally unconvincing characters. Wolfe takes an inordinate amount of time painstakingly developing his characters, then gives them nowhere to go and very little to do. In a 700 plus page book he uses 650 page to develop various storylines and then, seemingly realizing he had gotten nowhere with this story, he tacks on the most contrived, absurd and insulting ending I've encountered. I literally burst into laughter, the ending was so bad. If this was the last book availible on the planet I wouldn't reccomend it to my worst enemy. I could not be more disapointed."
3,"Well, it's full of something","""A Man in Full"" seems like several books were pounded together, with the subtley of a guided missle. It's certainly a very quick read and very enjoyable at times, but if you like to savor your literature, this book isn't for you. I think I found the fairly ludicrous plot, which I don't think Wolfe for a second had any faith in himself, to be most irksome. I also disliked how Wolfe chooses to go to ridiculous finite details in descibing a characters' clothes (i.e. how far the dots are spaced on one character's tie) and yet completely backs out of exploring the emotional depth of important scenes where characters confront each other. It's not a bad book, but... I was expecting more from something that's 700+ pages."
4,Wolfe Wimps on Women Characters,"Yup, this is a great read, but rarely have I found a book so lacking in development of its women characters. The sterotypes are in full, one-note force: grasping, greedy, harpy-like women LOVE to tear their men down, while happily emptying their wallets. At the other extreme, and this saves the book and makes it the compulsive page-turner it is, the male characters are diverse, whole, and beautifully portrayed. Like many other customers, I too found the last chapter to be a disappointment...Wolfe obviously had a deadline to meet, or just ran out of juice."
3,Ups & downs,"You can never go wrong with Tom Wolfe. If you buy one of his books you can be absolutely sure to get hours of thrilling entertainment. Like most of his books ""A man in full"" shows you the author's almost Dickens-like ability to interweave seemingly unrelated people. But wheras I have, personally, often been exilarated by his plots this book fails to deliver on that. The ending is banal and very predictable. I had a strong sense of what would eventually happen way before I reached the last chapters. And if there is one thing that can make you feel low it's bad endings. In this case it doesn't help that you get to it after having read more than 700 pages. Having said this I must add that Tom Wolfe still manages to entertain and impress you. Reading ""A man in full"" is an experience of long ongoing ups and downs."
3,only thing missing was an ending to match a great story,"I know 742 pages is a bit of a long read, however, I would have rather read a book whose ending was 200 pages or so longer and matched its build-up, then read a book that speeds through the press conference, and Croker's decision to give up everything. It just seemed like Mr. Wolfe spent such an arduous time building up the character of Charlie Croker as this beast of a materialistic man, and then whirls to an about-face after converting to the religion of ""stoicism."" Overall, good book, - entertaining, worth reading, I would have, however, prefered a more elaborate ending."
4,more than 700 pages of good writing,"This is definitely a great book. I started reading it before I moved from Europe to Atlanta 2 months ago. It gave me a clue of what to expect here. Many chapters of the book are written in ""real-time"". So you can exactly imagine the situation the character faces right now. Everything is written so brilliant that you can actually smell the summer in Georgia. However, the ending of the story was not what I expected - but it was definitely a lot of fun reading it."
2,"Mr. Wolfe Got Way Too ""Full"".","Talk about a letdown. A major disappointment. Characters are larger than life yet so flawed that one winds up not liking any of them with the possible exception of Atlanta's mayor and the kid from Oakland. It's not even worth remembering their names. The storyline starts out well enough, but the last third of the book read like the author got to a point in the plot that he realized he did'nt possess a clue as to how to end it sensibly. The ""new age"" awareness that our boy Croker falls into seemed to be a total cop-out. I got the feeling Wolfe wrote all but the last 100 pages and then decided ""I've got one hour to finish this thing"". Way too much description of what people were wearing, the food they ate, and on and on. This kind of book leaves we wondering if others who raved about this were reading the same piece of literature I suffered through. Better luck next time."
3,"Well said, but weak at the end.","Why does it so often happen in contemporary fiction that we have wonderfully laid out plots, engaging characters, and tremendous potential, only to see the thing resolve in a weak and ineffectual manner. I was with Tom Wolfe until the end, but the concluding pages gave me far more resolution than I required, too much simplicity, and what looked like the opening for a sequel. Spare me that! Still, the style of writing is incredible in that description can carry pages on end. I guess I would conclude that a realistic work of fiction as this seemed to be also requires a realistic ending."
3,"a good book until the end, ... it fell off a cliff, ...","I have enjoyed everything by Tom Wolfe and this book was no exception. I enjoyed most of the character development, the vignettes and stories, the drama and suspense. However, the ending was so terribly disappointing. It was as though Mr. Wolfe simply got tired of writing and decided to wrap things up, .... and he didn't do a very good job. I regret reading the last ten pages. Better he would have left me to my own fantasies and conclusions about the character. A good piece of work gone to hell."
1,"Awful. And he misspelled ""Freaknik"".","That's the only word for it. I spent most of my life in Atlanta, and I have no clue what city Wolfe's writing about, because it sure isn't Atlanta. I've never even met anyone who'd been to a debutante ball or whatever that is. Wolfe oversimplifies Atlanta, turning it into some ""Gone With The Wind"" ripoff.All I can say is - I've never seen anything like the Atlanta he describes. And I lived there.Tom Wolfe's writing is clever for about the first 10 pages. Afterwards, it's like driving nails into your forehead.And one last detail - anyone, and I mean anyone, who's lived in Atlanta will know what Freaknik is, and how much contraversy surrounds it. But on page 1, Wolfe misspells it. For somebody who's so concerned with accuracy and local color, he sure is sloppy.This isn't satire - this is torture."
2,"Depressing and cynical, a sad view of human nature.","While this book is a quick and easy read, it reflects a very cynical view of human nature. ""A Man in Full"" could have been written by Thomas Hobbes. While critics claim the book is an accurate depiction of American society in the 1990s, a careful and honest reader will see that Wolfe fails to take into account the good side of Americans, describing only greed, selfishness, and self-pity. Americans are undoubtedly greedy and selfish, but they are also (perhaps paradoxically) kind and generous. Wolfe needs to look outside his narrow mind and see the good side of the American character. Perhaps then, like the Grinch, his pea-sized heart will grow and he will put his (undisputed) talent to work writing the truth about twentieth-century America--selfishness and generosity can (and do) exist together, and more often than not we care just as much about each other as we do about ourselves."
1,Most over rated book I've read in a long time.,"I once heard a minister say if it takes longer than 20 minutes to get his message across he loses his audience and is likely to repeat himself. Tom Wolfe should have taken a lesson from him, I found the book extremely redundant. This is the most over rated, disappointing book I've read since ""The Bridges of Madison County""."
3,good but some noticeable flaws,"The characters in ""Man"" were better developed than in ""Bonfire."" However, the story in Wolfe's latest novel doesn't have the same sort of sharp, focused satirical edge of his first. In ""Bonfire"" we knew exactly what he was skewering: opportunism in money-fevered 1980's NYC. But Atlanta? The late 1990's? The subject matter is less asured but the characters are more likable and the descriptions are wonderful as always (I've never been to Atlanta but now I feel like I have). The ending, while a bit of a sell out and somewhat hastily written (Wolfe's editor at FSG probably said to the master, ""END IT ALREADY!""), is better constructed in form than in ""Bonfire."" It's good, but has some noticeable flaws. Still, I couldn't put it down and that's the real acid-test for any book."
2,Literature it ain't,"This book is like a summer blockbuster action movie - easy to sit though, but leaving no meaningful impression. That this collection of stereotypical characters and trite plot resolutions got nominated for book awards is a tribute to its impressive marketing campaign, not its content. I enjoyed Wolfe's other books far more. His time seems past."
4,Great story - abrupt end!,"I have just finished reading this book for the second time - read it first when it was published. I remember enjoying the story a lot - Wolfe is a great storyteller and his characters are very believable. The book made an impact on me because it introduced me to Stoicism and Epictetus. As many of the reviews state, however, the book does finish abruptly. I would have preferred hearing how Conrad and Charlie ended up through their eyes/dialogue than through two other minor characters. Given how much detail Wolfe went into other parts of the book, I would have expected a more thorough ending and not have all the loose ends tied up so quickly and neatly! Give us something to wonder about! I would like to see this become a movie - after first reading it 8 years ago thought for sure it would have happened by now....."
5,A happy reader in full,"I have found a new ""favorite"" author to follow. After initially discovering Tom Wolfe's ""I Am Charlotte Simmons"" which I thought was fantastic, ""A Man in Full"" equals that output. What I like best about Tom Wolfe is his diversity of characters and storylines. He keeps you in suspense with plot development, and I think that's how he justifies 700 plus pages. His research or knowledge (I'm not sure which) of subjects like horse stud mating was just as riveting as one of his character's disturbing prison journey. And to top it off I find myself laughing out loud with the many funny social identities sprinkled all throughout the story. It's just enjoyable. I also thought that his story felt sharp and relevant 10 years after it was written. Looking for my next Wolfe novel."
1,A Man In Full by TOM WOLFE really reaked.,"It was the worst book that I have ever read in my life. I can't beleive how dumb the plot is. I think that this book is an insult to all authors all over the world. It has such poor useage of verbs and is accually, in my point of veiw, very unsophisticated."
1,what a waste of time,"I was really looking forward to A MAN IN FULL but found it bloated, self-indulgent, and smugly boring. I can't wait to take my copy to The Strand (a second-hand book shop) so at least I can recover a portion of the cover price. The time wasted? Out the window..."
2,Why the Hurry?,"This was a very good read, with colorful characters, and good character development for the most part. But the ending of the book was rushed. It was conventional and pat . . . the last few chapters went by so fast, I had to re-read part of it to see if I wasn't missing something, and I wasn't. The end of the book made what came before almost trite and meaningless."
1,Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover....,"I should have received a clue that this was going to be a pompous, over-written disaster of a book when the author's name was written in text 5 times taller than the title of the book.The characters were unlikeable, the story was barely enthralling and it was pretty evident at the end that either Wolfe had become bored or his editor had told him to wrap it up because I have seen less predictable and convenient endings on Scobby Doo.I bought this book for $1 at a yard sale and I barely think I got my money's worth. The most interesting thing for me were the descriptions of Atlanta, and even those Wolfe managed to get wrong in several places. What I wouldn't do to have the week it took me to read this drivvle back."
3,Stars for the Writing Not the Plot,"Wolfe doesn't disappoint as far as his ability to seduce readers with his words and understanding of a place. However, the plot was a bit overwrought. I am one of the people who feel this book was a little long and most of the characters not developed enough (strange for such a long book). But you can't beat his writing style. That's what kept me engaged."
3,A mixed bag,At times gripping and then pages and pages of boring descriptions of aspect of the novel. It could have been better because he has a nice plot.
4,"Some good parts, some worthless parts",I loved loved loved loved loved all the parts/bits about Charlie Croker. I couldn't get enough of him.All the parts about Conrad can be COMPLETELY skipped and you'll still know exactly what's going on at the end. That's what I did.
2,Scottie Pippen Writes Books?,"After reading many of the reviews contained herein, I wished I'd read them before I started this 700 page endeavor. Although I enjoyed many of the characters, I was completely appalled by the ending. It reminded me of the time our Chicago Bull hometown hero told the Coach he wouldn't go back in the game down by one with 1.8 seconds left. Like Pippen, Wolfe must have realized Full Court shots rarely go in, and after spending 600 pages developing characters, he decided to take his paycheck and go home, rather than seeing his writing thru to the end. I am a frequent reader, and found this to be the worst ending of a story ever imagineable. I'll never read another book by Wolfe again. I felt violated as I closed the book the final time. Unless you have too much time on your hands, I would recommend leaving A Man In Full on the shelf and making another selection."
2,"tedious, repetitive, and disappointing","Living in Atlanta, I looked forward to reading this expose of my cities obsession with overdevelopment. That part, Wolfe got right, but it wasn't worth wading through a book of this length.His penchant for repeating cute phrases such as ""Roger Too White"" and ""boys with breasts"" got on my nerves. But most disappointing (and disturbing) is that all the Heros of his book are white (including the really obnoxious, despicable lead character, Charlie Croker whom he converts into a rather unbelievable hero by the end of the book) and all the black characters are either portrayed in a negative light or as rather weak in principals (such as the mayor). Why couldn't Wolfe include some good African-American role models in a book about a predominantly black city?"
5,A really enjoyable read,"I really enjoyed this book. I don't know what people are whining about, this book threads through a great many stories, covering many different backgrounds with research and depth. It's more than just interesting, it's captivating and contains alot of grit in an un-put-down-able tale of suffering and triumph."
3,"Okay, but not great","Loved Bonfire. . .thought it was one of the best contemporary novels. I'll have to agree with the other reviews here, and say that the ending was quite a cop-out! I expected more from the New Journalism Poster Boy!One other reviewer says that the male characters in the novel are merely components of the whole--the Man in Full. An interesting thought, but I still contend that the entire sub-plot about Conrad was extraneous and superfluous. Charlie could have had his epiphany sans the help of the big armed one.Many of the descriptions of people were, in typical Wolfe fashion, very amusing. AND, if you work in the corporate world, there are times that you will guffaw at the inanity of such things as ""paradigm shifting""!"
2,Large build up. Larger let down,"Neat story with great character development (why not when you've got over 700 pages to work with). Admittedly there are some slow periods, but the higher points (""excuse us while we have a cactus"") more than make up them. I had to soak my feet after spending a day in Oakland with Conrad. What an adventure! However, what happened with the ending? Did the author run out of ink? Time? Imagination? Patience? Perhaps there is no way to ""properly"" end such a saga, but there certainly has to be a better ending than the one used, as it leaves the reader feeling let down and frustrated for having spent the time to read the prior 700+ pages."
5,A brilliantly woven tapestry of the most unlikely characters,"This book is fabulous! Rich, thick & meaty. The characters are so well drawn that you can't help but think of them like real people! Charlie Croker is so pathetic...but I love him! I particularly love the character of Conrad.Tom Wolfe hits the mark again!"
3,"The ""Novessay"" niche has been discovered by Wolfe","This book marks the second novessay (novel/essay) by Tom Wolfe. His first,""Bonfire of the Vanities,"" was a fictional essay on modern New York culture peopled by the denizens of Gotham. ""Man in Full"" is in the same style. He looks at modern Atlanta, the center of southern culture, and turns a brilliant essay into an average novel. It's a biting satire on the modern mores and problems of a predominately black city and the southern mind. It would have been an essay for the ages but Wolfe has discovered that there just ain't money in essays. Where will he strike next? Dallas, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles. Shades of Michener!"
3,tom wolfe must get over himself,"wolfe is an excellent writer and has moments of wonderful sardonic description but i think he is probably a jerk. millions read man in full because they assumed such a big book would be full of profound comment on the human comedy etc etc blah blah blah. it's tedious reading (except for a few shining moments of absolutely perfect prose), but readers plugged through for the epiphany that was bound to come at the end. Many put down the book when they were finished and thought ""huh? where's the life-lesson? what have i learned from this gargantuan literary feat?"" not much, and i think wolfe knows it. he could write an interesting story if he wanted, but this was not interesting. the characters inspired dislike at best and indifference for the most part. it is worth reading for some of the prose but the plot is missing something, and i bet tom wolfe was laughing the whole way through."
4,Why did it end...there is so more to write/read,"The characters in this book were terriffic...but we need more. I can't wait another 12 years for the next TOm wolfe novel, you've got the characters, you've got the story line, lets see what becomes of Roger Too White, and Charlie, and Peepglass and Conrad. I miss these guys allready.It is a truly entertaining read, don't let the 700+ pages scare you, they fly by, and you'll beg for more!!!!"
3,A good story that languishes,"A Man In Full is a good story, but certainly not a great work as was Bonfire of the Vanities. There are some flashes of Tom Wolfe's brilliance, but then the story languishes. Many of the characters seem to lack substance and the story is contrived to make them fit. Mr. Wolfe's satirical humor is woven throughout the novel. One is left with the question, does Mr. Wolfe confuse Reggie Jackson with Jessie Jackson or is his portrayal of Jessie Jackson hiting home runs intentional. I recommend the book as long as your expectations are not for another Bonfire."
3,Great Characters Looking for a Plot,"I loved Bonfire and looked forward to reading Man In Full. Charlie Crocker is a classic -- I can already see James Garner playing him in the movie! However, none of these great characters went anywhere and the ending was just plain silly, unbelievable and trite. We deserve better from Wolfe."
3,Entertaining but Overrated,"Wolfe has a marvelous gift for language; there are passages in this book as witty and insightful as any ever written. I admire him for taking on larger topics and multiple characters -- it's true that few people even attempt to work on this scale anymore, and Wolfe does so ably enough. However, Wolfe's talent for breadth is greater than his talent for depth. The characters are all shallow, and at times unbelievable. They frequently ""discover"" things about their city or society that they would certainly know -- it's a device for informing the reader, of course, but not a particularly clever one. And the ending is both so unlikely and so disappointing as to make one wonder whether Wolfe simply gave up. As entertainment, this is marvelous. As a candidate for the great American novel -- an unfair characterization maybe, but that's how it's been sold -- it's inadequate."
1,Big and Bad,"I was very disappointed in this novel, expecting a good book from Wolfe. It's hard to imagine that an American Southern gothic novel can be too silly, but this one was. The author tried to expand the story by just using too many words, and the plot line became outrageously esoteric and unbelievable. I finished it in the same mindset that keeps me staring at a gory car crash. And the ending fizzled just as if the bleeding car victim had jumped up amidst the paramedics and run off to go shopping."
2,The ending - - an excalamation point for a bad book!,"As a native Georgian, I was anxious to read this book. I was interested through the beginning of the book, no doubt enticed by the Charlie's dealings with his bank as I am a banker. Even though the bank discussions interested me, I found it a bit far-fetched and unlikely. I believe the book was a let down, however, I forged on and read (sometimes rushing through pages--especially the Conrad chapters) the whole book. I truly have a hard time understanding how Wolfe ended the book as if he had one minute to think up an ending. He did a pretty good job of setting the reader up for the ending, yet he fumbled miserably. I can not honestly recommend to anyone to read."
4,Millenial Dickens,"I disagree with some of the reviewers comments about the ending. It makes sense. Especially if we compare it to the works that most closely resemble Wolfe's novel. Think of David Copperfield or Pickwick Papers and then blend it with Bonfire of the Vanities and you have ""A Man In Full"". A great novel. And once you get past the first 400 pages or so, very entertaining. I doubt the book will be a classic, but certainly it is a thorough bred satire of American culture teetering on the brink of the next millenium. Two thumbs up."
1,I can't believe I read the whole thing!,"If this book hadn't been a present from someone whose taste in books I respect, I would have dumped it earlier. I found the descriptive details of the man's wife and her friend tiresome and boring. Then again, I am a woman -- so the details don't titillate. When Istart wondering about the author, the disruption intrudes into the story. As to the story--terrific plot. Could have been enjoyable if it were one third the length.I have never read (skimmed in lots of places) a book that screamed so loudly for a good edit!!! Do not recommend anyone spend a dime on this book. Check it out at the library or borrow it from a friend, that way you can put it down permanently after the first foray into the thicket of verbage."
3,"Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper","This book started out and continued at break-neck speed and was difficult to put down because of the way it pulled you into the lives of the characters. However, as seems to be the problem with all authors these days, it appears that Mr. Wolfe got tired of writing it and threw together a slap dash ending that seemed to have been written in three seconds. While the ending was admirable in that it tied up the loose ends, it really left you feeling like you'd been ridden hard and put up wet."
3,Strangely distant...,"Well... I do not know how I got through the 780 pages - except for Conrad Hensley, I cannot remember one single character that I found interesting. Okay, some passages were quite well-written: the horse-breeding, Peepgass' paternal suit, White's insecurity, among others. However, what's left after having read the book? Not a lot, I'm afraid. Joyce once said that if Dublin got destroyed, people should be able to rebuild it just by reading Ulysses. The same is true for Wolfe's novel concerning Atlanta. The story is about well-dressed and rich snobs in huih places playing with power they should not possess, and about nave Conrad Hensley, for whom I really cared. He was the only one who did not deserve such a weak ending of the book. Pseudo-sectarianism - give me a break!"
1,Much ado about nothing,"This is one of the most irritating writers I have come across in a long time. Example: Mr Wolfe delights in supplying the correct anatomical term for each and every muscle his heroes are decked out with. We keep reading about latissimus dorsii and deltoids and the trapezius, etc. Is he a frustrated weightlifter, or merely showing off? Example: This one is not only silly, but I found it insulting. Each person is described by his exact colour, from dark to light chocolate, to high yeller, etc. And the worst of them all: an authentic blue-blood black? Example: I have not come across any woman in this book who is not bitchy, shrill, clinging, pathetic etc. On the other hand, there are at least two types of men: There are MEN, and there are the others. Say no more."
2,Indecision of the long-winded kind,"I loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it--pretty much in that order. Around page 500 or so it started to really get good and then as so many others have said, Wolfe couldn't decide how to end it so he just did! Terribly! Unbelievably! Disappointingly! His constant explanations of ""street"" language and translations into ""southern"" were annoying if not insulting to his readers. But he really had a good thing going for awhile. Too bad he couldn't decide. Maybe the movie will have better editors and tie up the loose ends. One can only hope."
2,tom wolfe is full of himself,"This book is about 400 pages too long, and the ending is pathetic. Wolfe takes his time describing men's ties and shoes, and ladies' loins and breasts, but rushes through the ending. I did enjoy the prison scenes, although, the jive talk was pretty much annoying."
3,lacks the spark of longevity,"wolfe has created a world which drifts in and out of my understanding. he trys to tackle the racial undercurrents in atlanta, but at the same time he pokes fun at the black experience, the stoic parody is amusing ,but i find it unsatisfying and brings the novel to an artifically abrupt ending. surprising after 700 odd pages ! i guess the editor was putting the pressure on ! how long will woolfe survive on the dinner circuit with this effort ? its no bonfire for sure."
4,Fun to read...,"I have to admit, I was disappointed in the ending. However, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Great Literature? No. Enjoyable and a great escape? Yes. Funny? Absolutely!!"
3,"Real world real estate deals, and southern quail hunts","Given to me as a Christmas gift, I questioned whether I had the interest to attempt a 742 page book. While I found the book very interesting, and true to life in many respects, I was disappointed at the ending. Anticipating mulitple scenerios for the conclusion, none of them materalized. Since my profession is in commercial banking, I did find the Charlie Coker storyline interesting and easy to follow."
3,Fun to read (for a while); ending bit the dust,"Wolfe does a great job of capturing all the little nuances of contemporary life and incorporating them into an interesting story. His characters are the type of people that if you knew them in real life, you'd really wish you didn't. But Wolfe's writing style really draws you in - - it engages. Until the end. The ending was boring, unbelievable, and didn't seem to flow from the entire book. After spending 600 pages developing the Croker character as a completely intractable, hard headed man, the guy does a total about face and becomes a religious fanatic. In about a day. I still enjoyed this book for the most part. But don't hold your breath for an exciting end note."
3,Great except for the last 40 pages,"Incredibly well written, well researched, plausible within reason, yet the ending is dissappointing. Instead of ending with a bang, it ends with a wimper. There is no resolution of anything. It sort of drifts off into no where. No good guys, no bad guys. Just a lot of confused and misguided players. Sad to see such a well-written book end so poorly."
3,Come on folks...it was an entertaining story...admit it!,"I live down the street from the Santa Rita jail. I have been a ""Crash and Burn"" wage slave. I have seen some of these ""good ol boys"" in action. I have questioned the day to day B.S. just like Charlie Croker. This was an entertaining story,and isn't that why we buy these kinds of books?"
3,Could have been better,"It's extremely well written, of course. And, the characters are very interesting. I found myself thinking about the people a lot - even when I wasn't actually reading the book. But I, too, was disappointed in the ending. It's like all a sudden there's some big hurry to wrap up the story. Since I had already spent more than a week reading this - and enjoying it, I wouldn't have minded reading a few more chapters devoted to a more detailed and fully developed ending."
4,"Starts strongly, but fades...","I liked this book. It is in fact, a hard book to dislike, however, I was somewhat disappointed with the finish. It seemed almost as if Wolfe was desperate to get the thing finished off and shot to the publisher, because the last few chapters seem out of step with the rest of the book, smacking of a ""lets get this baby wrapped up"" attitude. Having said that, the book was a page turner, the characters were engaging, and the commentary pithy. Very good, but not great."
3,"Great storytelling; richly textured; weak, wimpy ending.","Disappointing finish after 700+ pages of superb storytelling, engrossing characters, and finely woven tapestry of observation, locale, and relationships. The conclusion was not a logical or fitting end to the story. What happened?"
3,"Wonderful characters, but a disappointing ending...","I concur with many of the other reviews that this is essentially a Bonfire of the Vanities, southern-style. I enjoyed Wolfe's characters, particularly Conrad and Martha but felt let down in the end when these characters, who I invested so much time in, were merely mentioned in an epilogue. It just seems like there is so much more to be written after the press conference is held! Wolfe's depiction of the South is enjoyable, especially how Charlie represents the epitome of a ""good ol' boy."" I don't regret reading this book, I'm just sad that there wasn't 3 or 4 more chapters in it!"
3,THIS BOOK DID NOT MAKE ME SWEAT.,"TOM WOLFE MAY BE SEARCHING FOR LITERARY IMMORTALITY WITH ""A MAN IN FULL"", HOWEVER I THINK HE NEEDS TRY AGAIN. THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF QUANITY AND NOT MUCH QUALITY. I FEEL ALL HIS CHARACTERS LOST THIER IMPACT TOWARDS THE END OF THE STORY. TOM WOLFE HAS A ""FOUNTAINHEAD"" IN HIM BUT NOT THIS TIME AROUND,"
4,Piercing situational awareness of U.S. in the late 90s.,"Here's a segment of the U.S. in the late 90s: Arrogant real estate developers, arrogant ebonic speaking athletes, conspicuous consumption down in 'Lanta, Georgia, and more, if you don't get enough just through your daily living. An easy 700+ page read; it keeps interest and moves fast. Sadly, though, the ending is a disappointment and too much Dixie talkin' so that you have to read some sentences more than once (for us non-southerners). Still, Updike's and Mailer's unfavorable comments were unnecessary. Good book, bad ending."
5,the ending is good,"While I was reading this book, and loving it, I read many reviews here that said the ending was bad. This scared me, and made me hesitant to finish it. But I got past page 500 and then page 600 and then page 700 and then got to the end, and I can honestly say the book was great from beginning to end. Although the ending might have been a bit predictable, and maybe not totally realistic, this is a work of fiction and i read it as such. This book does not disappoint."
1,Expressive writing doesn't keep it from being boring.,"It is so long it feels padded. I couldn't make it past the unconvincing scene that described Wes showing Roger the real Atlanta - this scene was intended to edify the reader not Roger. Roger was a life long Atlantan, educated, sophisticated and an active member of the professional community - he certainly didn't need a lecture ( a long, long lecture) from Wes. As for the novels comic moments, the parts with Charlie Croker were funny but most of the other characters (men only - the women were cyphers) were depressing."
3,Verbose in Full,"Like its overblown main character, Wolfe wrote a book too full of words. While the storyline is interesting, the book deflates at the end. Apparently, the author had no creative idea how to write ""the end""ing..."
3,this book doesn't have an ending,"I hate it when I read a long book, have time invested into reading about these characters and then there is no ending. It's as if Wolfe all of a sudden realized, ""oops! I need to hurry up and end this book!"" The reader doesn't know what happened to several of the characters. Is Conrad still with Jill? Did Serena stay with Charlie? What caused Ray and Martha to marry? The only character that we really know what happens to is Roger White and the mayor. Wolfe could have saved some energy on cutting back on some of the laborious detail and put it in to an ending. The book is good, but is a big letdown in the end.Wolfe also seems a bit out of touch with late 90s - current day Atlanta."
1,Too many words,The man who wrote such perfect magical-realist journalistic writing in concise and compact form is now producing novels that are bloated in every sense. Big fat doorstops full of overblown writing and sloppy construction. Pity he got so famous no one at the publishing company will act the tough guy and edit him properly. Big fat smug book written by a compact smug man.
1,He got tired of writing and threw together a sorry ending,Its not worth your time. None of the characters are admirable.
1,tedious,"I tried, I really tried to read this boring, self- indulgent, deadly tedious book, but I just couldn't get past the 200th page (and that was pushing it). The only thing about the book that was on the positive side was it helped me fall directly to sleep. Plus what's the deal with his obvious strong dislike of women past 40? He's no prize himself. I think Mr. Wolfe should take a break from writing and maybe try another profession. Yuck."
3,Too long and not believable.,"Tom Wolfe describes some bigger than life characters in this convoluted tale but only lets them come to life sporadically.The pivotal premise that Crocker coming to the defense of the black football player would prevent a race riot was weak at best. A bank forgiving millions of dollars for a few words at a news conference by this ""washed up hasbeen"".......I don't think so!As for the ending....where did everyone go? Your left dangling.So much hype..... so little substance."
3,"""His trapezius tightened and his forearms bulged""","I have to agree with another reviewer -- it's a Bonfire down south. Right down to the physical tics and aforementioned bulging forearms of practically every male character. If they don't have bulging forearms, they either (Conrad) work hauling things around in a freezer until they get them or (Wes) have a driver who does. There are scenes of searingly accurate social commentary, and it's an entertaining read, but you might almost think he waited 12 years since ""Bonfire"" so he could reuse some situations and dialogue with some southern accents thrown in and maybe people would have forgotten."
4,Wolfe had me hooked right to the end then it faded.,"From page one Mr.Wolfe works his magic,and is off and running as usual..The jail house lingo goes on and on and on...No doubt accurate but does not need 80 pages to convince the reader how many times the F word is used in the slammer. The story is terrific, right to the end. Some how Charlie deserves a better fate than Mr.Wolfe comes up with. Does not quite hit the home run as Bonfire of the Vanities did, but is a solid three bagger."
3,"Good, but not a masterpiece","I've spent the last three days reading this, and I'm well into it. I prefer a more rythmic and musical tone to writing, and Wolfe's writing seems a little dull to me. There are some good flashes of humor here and there. I'm a Southerner, and I think he's captured much of the authentic feel of living down South. All and all, the book seems like a recycled ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" where arrogant characters get their comeuppance. Although no one can capture the times we live in like Tom Wolfe, I don't consider him a great writer, but he is a good one."
3,Disappointent from a master,"Like everyone else, I eagerly awaited this book and read it the minute it came out. Frankly, I found it disappointing and the more I think about it, the less appealing I remember it. There were images of the Southern real estate developer which really captured the essence of the south as well as the mentality of a real estate developer, boom or bust. Also, the bank work-out specialist was interesting to watch. While the factory worker was a sympathetic character, at times I felt like I was reading two novels and tying them together was done very poorly with no real feeling.The final professional move by Croker is bizarre and unrewarding. I encourage everyone to ignore the hype and skip this book. Maybe you'll like it but the time investment to read this many pages and take the risk of being disappointed is just not worth it."
1,Not Prodigeous,"I can't believe all the people with prodigeous arms, the women with prodigeous backs Wolfe writes about. There is very little imagination as he introduces new characters. His poor use of ebonics and slang is unwelcome, his phonetics for southern accents is silly. I should have read a spiderman comic."
2,TW reaches beyond his grasp.,"I looked forward to reading this novel after finding Bonfire of the Vanities somewhat amusing. However AMIF was a deep disappointment. I found the prose clumsy and the plotting overly contrived. TW clearly has little real contact with black America given that his use of African-American slang is consistently off and his attempts to recreate rap-rhymes were painful to read through. He simply lacks the experience and I suspect the skill, to pull off a credible story using the characters he has created. Also TW seems to equate cynicsm with balanced satire. I have rarely been as happy to finish reading a book."
1,Oh dear me,"Peppered with Wolfe's bizarre and laughable descriptions of burly male physique, A MAN IN FULL is a slow moving story filled with stock characters. Thank God that the universally panned BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES, the movie, will prevent this from ever hitting the big screen."
4,Excellent choice,Excellent choice. This is one of the few books I've read which explores the male prespective. It is exiciting at every turn. I could not put it down.
1,You pretentious little man!,"He should have just called it ""shanks akimbo"" and gotten it over with. Mr. Wolfe used this unusual phrase more times than he did ""a man in full"". He even included it in a rap song. Now, I'm not exactly a rap afficianado, but I doubt that particular phrase has ever been used in a rap song, or ever will be. Maybe he just thought it made him sound more intelligent. It served only to pull me out of the story, over and over again.I know that Mr. Wolfe has produced much better works than this. His research is painstaking in some areas, nonexistent in others (shooting quail with buckshot?). Oh yeah, and we get the accent thing (thang).I know that I personally spend enormous amounts of time worrying about whether or not people in New York will think I'm provincial. Please!Quick--someone get this man an editor!"
2,Not his Masterpiece but...,"Must be tough to sit down at the keyboard and try to top Bonfire of the Vanities and Right Stuff. Man in Full isn't painted on the broad canvas that made Bonfire so exellent. Feels like Wolfe just kept developing plot until suddenly an editor said, ""hey Tom, how about wrapping this thing up?"" Every issue resolved in 70 pages or so and then the epilogue. He's still a great stylist though and the book is worth reading for that alone."
1,disappointing,"i very much looked forward to reading this book. but i found it tedious in its detail and repetitive to the point of frustration. entire pages could be skipped without loosing the (weak) plot. and after all that, it just ended without a whimper."
4,Great book right up until a so-so end,"The book lived up to its' hype right up till the end. However, it seemed like Mr. Wolfe simply ran out of gas or interest in the project and came to a very unfortunate ending. The central characters simply changed in unreasonable ways in what seemed to be simply a quick way to tie all the loose ends together. In fact, the central character is really not heard from at the end of the book and is only discussed by secondary characters.This was a very unfortunate end to what was otherwise a very solid book. I really liked 90% of it, but it left me almost bitter at the end."
2,Mediocre writing of a somewhat fun story,"This is one book which could have been written in half the pages - think of the trees we could have saved! While there are high points and some wonderful satire, overall the book becomes tiresome and redundant. It's entertaining if you want a book which can be skimmed through over a rainy weekend and provide some satire, humor and interesting, if predictable, characters. This is not a piece of good literature that requires reading every line. Wait until the paperback comes out if you want to buy it."
1,"Inane and irrelevant, should not have been published!","This massive missive is racist, bigoted, bloated and boring. Frankly, it has absolutely no saving feature. If not received as a Christmas gift from a desperate family, I would not have had the misfortune of reading it! The plot is thin, the characters thin, the dialog grinding and tedious, the entire text tedious. How this book and author were acclaimed is not understandable. His previous text, Bonfire of the Vanities, was only marginally better. Why Tom Wolfe? New York, I guess......."
1,Flat,"What a bunch of liberal mish mash. A selfmade millionaire is made a laughing stock, while an escaped convict is held up the hero. Typical New Aged balogney. All form and no substance. I wish I could get my money back"
3,"It's not quite a FOUR, but definately 3.5 Stars = 7/10","""A Man in Full"" deserves praise on the quality of writing alone. The plot is engaging, the characters hard-to-forget, and the subtext insightful. The only chink in the armor of this book's merit is an ending and epilogue that feels rushed given the novel's steady, rhythmatic build to climax.I would consider five stars to be on par with a literary masterpiece. Four stars would be relative to Wolfe's own ""Bonfire of the Vanities."" This book doesn't quite measure up, but is well worth the read."
4,I enjoyed the first 500 pages of the book...,"The character development was great. But after about 500 pages, I found myself asking, ""Is this book WORTH 700-plus pages? The answer was NO. But I have to admit, I have been totally spoiled by The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test and Bonfire of the Vanities."
5,My new favorite book!,"I loved this book. Tom Wolfe has created a great story on a grand scale. The characters are extremely human with extreme human frailties. Humor is rampant throughout, and not a small amount of cynism flavors the proceedings."
5,Couldn't Have Been Better - Totally Pleasing,"This is a good book, really, and I expected nothing better. It's more than just entertainment, and it does not represent literature as an art, and represents the 90s. The characters are deep. The plot is complex and some passages are very funny and it's a page turner. It justifies all the ""frenesi"" created around it."
3,Good book. Not fantastic but worth reading,"This is a good book, really, but I expected something better. It's just entertainment, a good one, but it does not represent literature as an art, nether represents the 90s. The characters are not deep enough. Yes, the plot is complex and some passages are very funny and it's a page turner, but it does not justify all the ""frenesi"" created around it."
5,A Masterpiece of Modern American Fiction,"Tom Wolfe's latest novel is a gripping portrayal of life in American life in the 1990's. Characters span the entire strata of American society. They allow us enlightening glimpses into worlds some of us may never otherwise see. Descriptions of characters and thier psyches are often cruel at the same time they are warm. This makes for an extremely powerful work that will completely pull you in and modify many of your current perceptions of the world if you let it.Furthermore, Wolfe's signature ""wordiness"" makes for a refreshing departure from the majority of contemporary American fiction which often aims to create a feeling of extremely fastpaced action by through minamalisms more appropriate for a 30 second TV advertisement than for a true work of literature.All said, A Man in Full is a masterpiece up there with those of Dickens and Twain."
2,"A promising begining, but a pathetic ending","A Man in Full starts off with tremendous promise. Wolfe again weaves the same rich tapestry of characters, who intersect in and out of one another's lives, much as he did in Bonfire. I was really looking forward to a delicious climax. But less than half way through the book, we get lost. Instead, the players who seemed to offer the possibility of such rich texture muddle about as charicatures of themselves, or of players we've seen before in Bonfire or in other moral panderings. Even the names of the characters are there to beat you over the head with Wolfe's point: the sniveling sycophant named Peepgas (honest, I'm not making this up), or the successful black lawyer, Roger White, who is challenged by his ""blacker than thou"" friend, the Mayor of Atlanta. Ultimately, the ending is beyond disappointment. My advice: read the first 1/2, then put it down and imagine your own ending. You'll be much happier than if you suffer through the last 300-400 pages."
3,...shanks akimbo!,"After enjoying the first half of the much anticipated book, this reader felt that Mr.Wolf sold short on his delivery of a solid ending. Did he tire of writing? Was he ""chicken"" to have his characters latch onto mainstream reliigon? Must he resort to fantasy after creating the reality of the man in full? Or was he simply tired ? Maybe another ten years of work might have sealed a better fate for our characters. Too many things left ""akimbo!!! Too many questions left unanswered! What is all the hype about Tom Wolfe about ??? ...And what are all these exclamation points trying to convey !!!!"
5,A Man in Full,The best book I've read in years. A classic saga of a man who had everything and did'nt respect what he had. Perfect!
2,A man in full try's the patience and the sensibilities,"please, someone, anyone explain to me what this book is trying to say. please help me understand why wolfe uses 120 words to say what could be said in only 50. please help me understand why sick, vicious profanity and poorly crafted racial stereotypes is hip. please help me understand how i can indentify, revile or at least give a hoot what happens to his thinly crafted characters. and please, oh please, help me find the passages as ""beuatiful as any ever written""this book is a waste of time."
5,what the dickens?,"you've got to hand it to tom wolfe with this book. the scope is bigger than anyone else writing today and is earily, yet not unpleasantly, reminiscent of the most sprawling works of charles dickens. bleak house for the next century. let's hope hollywood doesn't even try to get its hands on this baby. should be compulsory for everyone to read wolfe - especially a man in full. bravo."
2,"All plot, no characters","Some of the worst character development I have encountered in a ""major"" novel. At the end of 740 pages, I had to ask myself, who are these people?The book was a page turner and held my interest, but the characters were caricatures."
2,Promise Unfulfilled,"The book contains marvelous, larger than life characters, but falls apart at the end. It is as if Mr. Wolfe knew it was time to close the book, but lost interest instead."
5,I could hardly put it down!,"I can agree with some of the other erudite critics here that maybe the ending, the epilogue, was a tad flat, but probably only because it ended too abruptly. The first 700 pages or so were GREAT! I loved practically every minute of it! Wolfe is wonderful . . . still!"
3,A fun read,"Have you ever read a book that when you put it down you feel sad and a little empty because the story had to end? This is definetly not that kind of book but it was fun to read. Some of his characterizations of people and events were incomparable. Being from Hawaii I took particular interest in Five-Oh. The pidgin dialogue was amazingly accurate. I was impressed with how well he handled it. It is very difficult to write pidgin accurately. Overall, it was a pleasant diversion but the ending was pretty weak."
5,An American classic.,"Makes my list of top 5 books I have ever read - and I read a lot. Especially insightful if you live in the Souteast U.S. Should be required reading for all Freshman English Lit classes. Not only a great drama, but really great insights into some parts of our society that don't get talked about very much - both high and low. But, if you don't like to think or be challenged don't bother with this one."
3,Well the first was good...,"The first three quarters of this book are excellent. The characters are well crafted and their stories are really interesting. However, without giving anything away I'll just say that the ending was downright stupid. Tom Wolfe has always been a master storyteller which is why I was so surprised that he would take such a wonderful book and give it such a horrible ending. That said, I enjoyed the rest of the book so much that I didn't feel that I had wasted my time reading it. If you love Tom Wolfe I'd recommend getting this book, but don't keep your expectations too high, this is no ""Bonfire of the Vanities""."
3,Almost a great novel...,"A very interesting book from a great author. Not only will you get a good story but you will learn a lot about the state of Georgia. This is one of the better novels I have read. It is sure to be big movie material. Though this is a fat book (about 750 pages), it is a quick read (took me two weeks) and is a real page turner.The problem with the book is that it has a really disappointing ending -- the last 50 pages seemed really rushed and make little sense. This could have been one of the best period books of the 1990's but instead it leaves a bad taste in your mouth."
3,A Character Story With Uninteresting Characters,"Let me first say, that even when Wolfe misses, as he does here, he command of language and imagery at least keep the book from being boring.Plot is almost non-existent here. This is merely a showcase for characters, and unfortunately, only two of them are interesting (Conrad and Peepgrass). Croker, the main character, gives a glimpse of deep south money, but he proves to be repetitious and simple. The Mayor and Roger-Too-White characters are completely without depth and do not ring true.It does have some delightful segments of course, (the 'workout session' and Conrad's prison stay) which redeem the book somewhat. Otherwise, I would only recommend this to die-hard Tom Wolfe fans."
3,Arguably a good book.,"Tom Wolfe is arguably one of our best contemporary writers. His book ""A Man in Full"" reflects the arguably part.The story and the plot surrounding Charlie Crocker along with his ethical dilemas prove to be one of the highlights of the book. On the other hand, his focus on Conrad H.'s stoic obsession is hardly believable and bearable.All in all, it is a good book, but some of the characters need further depth and realism. Also, he has a tendency to drag certain eventas or actions for much longer than necessary.Then again his work is able to acomplish two main things almost flawlessly: First, he describes today's Atlanta Elite (and if you think it through, you can really see any modern cities high classes) down to the minor details and describing things only they would know. Second, he is able to prove that the values and principles guiding our society's actions are not only flexible, but able to bring the best of us when his spirit and morals are under trial."
3,700 pages of magic destroyed by 10 pages of junk ending,"I am admittedly a lifelong Wolfe fan. However, I really felt cheated with the slipshod ending of this epic novel. He dismisses the two protagonists in less than a paragraph each and spends 10 pages outlining the future for lesser characters. If he got tired of the project, the least he could have done is set it aside until he could contrive an ending worthy of the rest of the work."
4,the usual wolfe treatment--but thats ok with me.,I understand Norman Mailer has written a review of A Man in Full--but I have been unable to find this. Can anyone help me here?
2,5 Stars if not for the stupid ending,"I found the development of the story very enveloping. The parallel struggles of a rich man and a poor man and the attempt of a mediocre man to rise and a great man to avoid a fall. As the political aspect of the story evolved, there was an attempt at creating an issue and resolution of racial tension but the African American mayor and lawyer were just a side show and no real resolution was reached where there was not enough tension created that required a resolution.The first 600 pages of the 690 page book aside, were great. Then, apparently the author became bored and just decided to end the story by having everyone go crazy and give up on any further goals or motivations that had been created in the earlier part of the book.This was my first Thomas Wolfe novel. As I worked through the first 600 pages I told myself that I would read all of his works. After reading the last 90 pages of the book, I find it unlikely that I will read any more Wolfe."
4,Sumptuous offering,"I always enjoyed Tom Wolfe's novel. And I liked the way he wrote his novel. Tom developed the characters separately but gradually, and as always, their lives would cross path eventually and thus, a finale with a twist. With Tom's novel, there was always the essential social commentary, highlighting a marked contrast between those who lived on the verge of bread-line, and those who lived excessively & decadently; the touchy issue about race, sex; the ugly side of politics that never seemed to serve the interest of the people who voted the politicians into their office but rather, to satisfy & to quench the thirst of politicians for power & greed. This summary is too simplistic of Tom Wolfe's offering but enthusiastic readers would be bewitched by his almost too perfect narratives. I couldn't resist putting the novel down until the very last words were savoured. Definitely a feast to be had. Highly recommended."
5,"this book was so good, i am lost now that i have finished it","I know everyone of these people, every single one, and so do you. How can an author write a chapter like ""saddlebags"" and not have lived it? How? You tell me. As an entreprenuer i've been there and that chapter rekindled long buried flashbacks that took their time resettling. Wolfe's dialog and vivid descriptions of such diverse and singularly unique lifestyles rings crystal true in every instance. What a book! If you have been in the arena, are alive and living life, this book is for you."
5,A page turner of the first order,"Anyone with ambition can relate to the lead character in this marvelous story about an aging captain of industry who ultimately finds the journey far more enjoyable than the destination. Tom Wolfe has my vote as a talented author with the ability to keep the reader's interest through all subplots and characters he employs to tell the story of Charlie Croker, a Man in Full. An excellent and believable story that educates as well as entertains, I would recommend this book to anyone who simply likes to hear a good yarn."
3,"Should have been titled ""Sherman McCoy goes to Atlanta""","I loved Bonfire and was disappointed. The book has several main flaws. First, Wolfe repeats many of the literary devices he used in Bonfire in this book - the one about a character lamenting about the shortfall of his income to his monthly budget fairly leaped off the page at me. Further, there was no one I really cared about -- only one character evoked any sympathy from me; I really did not care what hapened to anyone else. And the sole sympathetic protangonist was so mired in an epic and gratuitous tour of prison life and Ebonic language, I lost interest in what happened to him and skipped the pages until he connected with the other characters at the end of the book. Finally, the ending felt contrived, as if Wolfe did not quite know how to end it. Wait for the inevitable movie."
2,Story was undermined by an uninteresting side plot,half the story seemed like a worthless tangent. The goings on in Atlanta were interesting but the other half of book dragged on slowly and painfully.
1,A man in full hate,Having read Tom Wolfe's other novels I very much looked forward to A Man in Full. I'm sorry to say that I'm deeply disappointed. It's simply a very poor novel in every respect. The only way to make it interesting is to look upon the book as written not by the novelist Tom Wolfe but by the journalist Tom Wolfe as an portrait and measure of US in the 1990's. But as such it's a very sad and depressing portrait which must have been written by a man who hates the society he lives in. It's a society governed by self-interest displayed as greed or the fear of poverty.It makes me sad because I met much more of humanity and dignity when I spent a lot of time in US about 20 years ago.
5,interesting,"I admit, I was completely engrossed in the lives of the characters that wolfe so brilliantly developed. Moreover, the undertones of political correctness, money, racism, and general concsiousness of the moral fabric of america as we descend upon the new century was both insightgul and profound. What I found interesting, however, is the inordinate amount of times wolfe focuses on mens strength and particularly, mens bodies (arms and muscles come up a lot). Too many for sure. Oddly, the only references to womens bodys is ""a boy with breasts"" ergo Serena Crocker, Charlies wife. I think Wolfe is gay, which is great, but he should have just created a gay character instead of infusing the prose with overtures of homoerotism."
4,Great when it's great; leaden when it's bad,"Wolfe is still a master storyteller when he's on, and I'd say he's on about 80% of the time in this novel. The account of Conrad's last day outside prison makes for one of the most riveting chapters I've ever read. On the other hand, Wolfe resorts to an absurd device to spring Conrad from prison, and he lapses much too often into throwaway lines and cliches like ""After what seemed like an eternity,"" or ""after what seemed like two hours"" or ""after what--"" well, you get the idea; pick a time frame between five minutes and an eternity. A book that took 11 years to write was well worth reading, but I wish he'd tacked maybe 6 nore months onto the writing time...."
5,It's nice to read a master again,"Tom Wolfe is a real writer, one who values the context as much as the angst of his characters. While some readers may find it reminiscent of 19th century novels and their focus on manners, I find it refreshing to live with believable people who are both the shapers and the products of their society. And is there anyone who can draw pictures in words as well as Wolfe? At times, I laughed aloud: he was describing people I see every day - their movements, their clothes (what a fabulous eye the man has!), their sweat stains. He also has them talk, and the sounds of Hawaiian pidgen, Georgia cracker, California Okie, urban street talk, and whiney bankdom (among others)all ring true. Don't miss this book: there's much to learn and enjoy from these pages."
2,Shallow and over-wrought,The character developments were shallow and not more than cartoons. The plot is outrageously contrived and the resolution forced. The best parts were the scenes at Turpntime. A disappointing read
4,HUMOROUS AMD GRIPPING NOVEL,AN EXCELLENT PLOT LINE WITH A SOMEWHAT IRONIC AND SURPRZING ENDING. I DID THINK THE RESOLUTION WAS A BIT DISSAPOINTING THOUGH.
1,Wolfeman needs an R&R,"Is a romance novelist writing under the name of Tom Wolfe? With all the rippling muscles and corded tendons, I thought I was reading Love, Lust & Lost in Atlanta..... Dump it at the next fund raiser at your local library..."
1,"Half done, bored, skipping pages, and the ending is poor?","I loved Bonfire and think the comparisons by the so-called experts are ridiculous. This book is tedious, the characters don't interest me at all and I'm halfway through. I find myself like many of your readers skipping many pages because I know where each scene is headed or I don't care enough to find out. I want to finish the book but the thought that I will come upon a lousy ending is truly disheartening. Just like the movie reviewers, I wish we had literary critics who were more honest. You can like the man and not like this book and should tell us so."
2,Length-driven wasted plot,"The characters are fabulous and the setting is wonderful, but this sure doesn't approach the quality of his previous offerings. You find yourself wisking through a dozen pages at a time, being pestered with minor, irrelevant detail, constant and annoying insights in to what characters are thinking. A good third of this book doesn't need to be read----it's just too bad he didn't mark the pages he wrote strictly to achieve the desired length. There is no way this book is worth the time it takes to read it. I remember the old days when I laughed at my dad for reading Readers Digest condensed books----but in this case, their version would undoubtedly be a far better experience."
1,Profoundly shallow.,"This is an important book to read for anyone who wants to know what kind of clothes people wear, what food they eat, what kind of cars they drive, and what kind of houses they live in. Along the way you will stumble across a story and subplots of marginial interest."
1,A terrible book.,"This book can't compare with Wolfe's other notable works like ""The Right Stuff"" and ""Bonfire of the Vanities"". It's boring, repetitive and tedious. I have to wonder if the professional reviewers who raved about this book actually read it."
4,Made a fool of myself on the subway,"because I was laughing so loudly at this book (the scene in the horsebarn). Lots of wonderful social commentary. Great humor. A couple of great stories (Conrad, Charlie). But everything that is complained about in the readers' reviews here (lame ending, contrived plot, too long) is right. It doesn't have the overall purpose of Bonfire and it's not nearly as good."
4,As a native Atlantian I enjoyed this book. Tom got it right.,There was a bit of Hyperbole in his characters but he has to do that to stimulate interest. I think he might have missed on the graft and political problems that exist in Atlanta but then only insiders know the facts about this.
3,enjoyable but not uplifting,"I enjoyed this book, more so at the beginning than at the end. The characters were interesting, but I think that Wolfe was way harsh to the women in the book. Although I enjoyed the book, ultimately I found it kind of depressing. And I hated the ending."
2,A punishing experience!,"I opened this book filled with hope. There is no question that Tom Wolf can write but unfortunately he did not possess a brutal editor to go with the brutal writing and cut all that redundant verbiage. Hurricane hair was good the first time. The first time. The first time. I did enjoy the chapter about the rut of Charlie's stallion, First Draw, and found it to be the perfect metaphore for this ""tome"". I can not suggest this book to anyone that has a life and things to do. Perhaps if I were bedridden and an avid soap watcher then it would be a worthwhile read. Try something else if you are looking for characters with an ounce of depth or just plain old credibility. Was the author payed by the word? Ah, that explains it. The ending remained true to the horse metophore, a tease and nothing more."
4,Great book...poor ending,"Having read some reviews written here prior to finishing this novel, I promised myself I would like the ending -- how could I not? I was enjoying this story so much. Advice to readers: if you want to keep this book close to your heart as I did, read up through Chapter 31 and then STOP. The story really ends there, everything that follows is as superfluous as Martha Croker (thinks she is). Leave it to your imaginations to finish the story. Having read the ending, though, I kept asking myself: Why? Why would Wolfe end the story this way? The book is a plausible, engaging, enjoyable read the entire way through. Then it turns absurd, ridiculous, and disappointing. I can forgive Wolfe for what happens to Charlie; but how can I forgive him for Conrad? Conrad, the true ""man in full,"" who (what, saves something like four people's lives throughout the book?), deserved better at the hands of the author."
3,"Best first 730 pages, worst last 10 pages, I ever read.","I thoroughly enjoyed this delicious tome. The characters were interesting and multi-dimensional and I think Wolfe truly understands people. HOWEVER, this was the most unsatisfying, rushed ending to a book I've ever read. It almost made me think, ""What was the point?"" If the ending had been better, this book clearly would have rated 5 stars. As it stands, it's obvious that Wolfe had a deadline to meet. What a disappointment!"
2,Needed way more editing,"WHAT a disappointment. The book was way too long by several hundred pages, and the constant repetition of descriptions (HOW many times did I need to know about Serena's cascading hair??? etc. etc.) was really tiresome. Perhaps Mr. Wolfe's reputation discouraged his editor(s) from actually doing their job. A pity. I have no idea what all the raving over this book was about. It was interesting in spots, but overall not worth the necessary investment in time. Could have been a lot better if the constant repetitions and endless descriptions had been pared down, and more effort had gone into the ending."
1,A terrible let down after Bonfire,"This book just doesn't get very interesting. The characters are developed O.K., but the plot just stagnates. Boring is the best way to sum it up."
1,"vapid, two-dimensional characters, but masterfully marketed","This book rivals ""The Phantom menace"" in the media -hype surrounding its release. Rarely does one encounter a human being without any redeeming quatlities whatsoever. However, Tom Wolfe managed to create an entire city of such characters. There was not one character in all of the book that I cared about in the least, which in committing to spend a week or more in reading a novel, is critical. Charlie Croker's arrogance is only equaled by Conrad Hensley's sanctimony. The ending was trite befitting the novel."
2,Tedious,"What long-winded nonsense. The Triumph and the Glory gave me everything Tom Wolfe tries to do in a foot thick book, did it in half the time, with twice the style, three times the enjoyment, and for a third of the price. Give me a good historical fiction novel like The Triumph and the Glory, The Hundred Days, or Cold Mountain over inflated, hollow, self-indulgent books like A Man in Full anyday. Tom Wolfe hasn't written anything good since The Right Stuff."
3,Hyperbolic portrayal of the South,"I looked forward to this book and am finding it to be a disappointment. Wolfe's incredible exaggerations of life in Atlanta and the South are absurd. I find myself reading the first sentence in each paragraph and skimming most of the rest. Perhap a good beach read, but no substance."
1,If you must -- wait for the paperback,I settled down for a good read. Wolfe rambled around and took me on a herky-jerky ride through interesting sub-plots that ended nowhere. He could have told the story in 360 pages and left out the 300 pages of repetitive character descriptions.I loved his earlier work. This one I could have left off my summer list.The ending stunk! I put the book down and said is this it? This author wasted my time.
4,Great writing style and characters substitute for no plot,"Without a doubt, TW writes some of the best social commentary and can develop characters with the best of them. Here, the character development and subplots are so well done that it hides the fact that the book really didn't have a story to tell (plot). The end was a real flop and steers the book dangerourly close to much ado about nothing. However, even though I felt cheated by the ending, the first 90% of the book kept me entertained so I can't demote this work too much."
3,it was rather anticlimatic,"I'm from the South, especially the areas they cover in the book. I felt it had a little historical content, also had several good plots going, but was limp in the end. I didn't bother to read the last few pages, just skimmed them."
2,A let-down,"This book was a disappointment. It was so contrived. Wolfe spent 11 years on this book. Tom Clancy writes even longer books in three months, and Wolfe is certainly a better writer than Clancy, but he doesn't show that HERE. I'm not feeling sorry for him financially, since Wolfe made millions off A MAN IN FULL. But what a waste of talent, when he could have been producing something great. F. Scott Fitzgerald said that the stuff he wrote the fastest was the best stuff. Wolfe should have heeded this advice in year 5, and started a different book. Oh, well, Wolfe can take comfort in the fact that Edmund Morris spent 16 years on his Reagan book DUTCH, and it's even bigger garbage than A MAN IN FULL. I hope Wolfe returns to nonfiction, which is what he does best (witness his recent article in FORBES)."
3,"Passable but yet ""will do"" for a lazy weekend!","I picked up the book based on someone's recommendation. Well it kinds of emerges as a turn off if you expect a lot but in itself, its not a unpallatable quick reading while you have time to kill........ To be fair to Mr.Wolfe, he takes us through the life of the decadent and later reformed Charlie Croker and the parallely about the wrongly implicated Conrad and his faith, and how there paths meet. It has some interesting insights into the Stoic Philisophy and try to talk about life in Modern Atlanta in its truth but, it is not a riveting tale, though with certain patience it is passable and entertaining in certain sections."
4,Transplanted Atlantan Speaks,"As a person who has been physically removed from Atlanta for several years, I was asked to read Wolfe's book so I could comment on the validity of the scenario. I felt like I was riding in the limo with Wesley Dobbs Jordan and Roger Too White! I'm ready to go back and travel those streets myself! Wolfe is a fabulous researcher. I found myself so connected to the book that it was a letdown when I actually finished it. Never have I read a 750+ page book in such a short time. I also felt betrayed at the end because I did not want to see the characters end up the way they did. I have not read Bonfire of the Vanities, but I plan to read it right away! I recommend this book to all."
3,An interesting effort,"While perusing the blurbs on the back of my copy of this book, I noticed someone mention that this was Wolfe's funniest book, which is absolutely true. Some scenes caused me to laugh aloud as I read them, and it seems that this may be the beginning of Wolfe taking himself less seriously. As always, Wolfe remains supremely readable. Even readers who don't like the subject matter can usually fly through a Wolfe novel. The ending seemed goofy and sensationalistic. While Croker was the main character, I found the social and economic comparisons between Roger and Conrad to be much more interesting. Perhaps with a different focus this novel might have presented more food for thought. Alas, in the form it now contains we must write it off as a novel by a journalist."
4,Enjoyable and Engaging,"Like meeting someone for the first time often the initial pleasantries don't hint at the richness that person has to offer. The first pages took some time, not because they weren't well written, but it just didn't peak my personal interests. However, like a person you just meet, once you start talking with them, you realize how fascinating it is to get to know that person. This is how I felt when I read this book. After meeting someone and becoming utterly involved in a conversation for the ages, how sad it is when the conversation stops abruptly due to that person having to clean up dog doo. The myth disintengrates, but memories linger. The ending sadly was a cheat. Nevertheless, it was a wonderful book."
4,"A great novel. Yes, it has flaws, but only minor ones","If you liked The Bonfire of the Vanities, you will probably enjoy this book, too. Many reviewers have comments about the 'bad' ending, indeed the end of the novel appears a bit rushed, in any case it is not like The Sixth Sense :-) Still, there are many literary gems to be found, from the description of Freaknic to the ruthless description of prison. The influence of Dickens on Wolfe's style is really noticeable if you are into that kind of thing, and that is not bad at all. It shows literary deftness, compassion, and above all a great story. Recommended."
3,"Hits the mark on Atlanta, misses on the story","As an Atlantan, I was impressed with Tom Wolfe's ability to pick up on the Atlanta social scene and what drives the residents of the City Too Busy To Hate. Because of this, I can't understand the uproar around town about how Wolfe has ""burned"" Atlanta for the second time.As a Wolfe fan, I think he started out with a great story line and character development, then lost his focus about 2/3 of the way through and had to really stretch to tie things together without going over 1,000 pages. Quite a shame, because this book has the makings of one of the better American novels in the last 20 years. Instead, I think it'll wind up being one of the better selling novels in the last 20 years, but nothing more than a footnote 20 years from now."
4,A nice surprise,"I usually only read horror and suspense novels and for some reason decided to pick this up because of all the hype. I am happy to say that it was well worth reading. This is an easy book to read that should appeal to most people. If you are looking for something to pass some time and entertain you, pick this up."
1,One star for the first page...,"John Cheever once said the only kind of book he could read was one in which he could ""get past the first page.""I saw southern gentlefolk riding to hounds or something and I completely withered. I think some books are best left un-read and un-reviewed by Yankees; Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood is another. I'm going to leave y'all to your own devices, cause you just lose this Boston girl with the first whiff of mint julep and horse manure."
2,"A MAN IN FULL BY TOM WOLFE, DISAPPOINTED","PERHAPS I EXPECTED A BIT MORE FROM SUCH A WRITER AS TOM WOLFE. FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE VERY ""LABORING"" IN READING; NOT AN ENJOYABLE READ THOUGH I DID FINISH READING THE BOOK."
2,Not literature,"John Updike is right, (an incidently it's rather irresponsible to obviscate his meaning with an out of context quote such as appear on the A Man In Full Page) Tom Wolf's writing is most descidedly not literature-- rather it is journalism masquerading as art. The popularity of books like A Man In Full, I think, stems from how little they challenge people-- that is we can read these books and feal literate because we understand them, where as legitmiate writing is too challenging, and makes us feel that we are not up to its requirrements."
2,Only a few pages of classic Wolfe in an overdone volume,"Over 700 pages and only a few pages of the brillant Wolfe we waited to read. Who really wrote this book Tom? I want to believe it was someone other than yourself...A story without a central theme, a weak line and no focus. Too many characters who vanish and an ending that happens only out of necessity. Poor Epictetus crys from his grave for his defamation at your hands Mr. Wolfe."
2,"Long, sometimes interesting, poor ending....","This book is typical of the novels that are being thrust upon us these days. The characters are at times very interesting, but mostly over-developed yet still unfamiliar. That is quite a trick. The book is also typical of today's novels in that the ending is weak, implausable, unsatisfying, and just plain stupid. I expected more from Tom Wolfe. Why can't anyone end a book? It is so irritating to enjoy a book only to have the ending ruin it. Zeus? Come on. Just dumb!"
3,Not a Wolfe Classic,Wolfe gives us a great feel for the south from the point of view of a greedy self serving businessman. That part of the book is interesting and somewhat consistent with what you expect from a Tom Wolfe book. So far so good. The first three quarters of the book are a 4 star rating. Then we get to the end. The ending is very disappointing. One gets the feeling that Wolfe ran out of creative steam as he got to the end. Very mediocre ending rating one star. Overall a three star.
3,Stick to non-fiction Tom Wolfe!,"The characters are stereotypical. The plot has some interesting turns, but ends with a whimper. As I was reading I wondered if this is the same author I remembered from ""The Right Stuff"", and ""Radical Chic"". Evidently not. A grand disappointment, but the writing is nevertheless grand."
4,A crash landing after a great trip.,"The first 600 or so pages are Tom Wolfe at his best, with fascinating, well-developed characters woven into a terrific tale of some social importance. But the rest reads as if Wolfe's publisher, reading his book chapter-by-chapter, gave him an ultimatum to resolve the plot before it rambled on for 1,000 pages or more. Wolfe brings the book to a screeching halt by whipping-up an improbable series of coincidences and character personality changes that'll have you groaning. A good read spoiled."
2,"An easy, sometimes fun read, but at the end, who cares?","For those that are up for the challenge of a 700 page book, forget about this one and read any interesting 400 pager. This book leaves you with a feeling of 'who cares?' I can't be bothered to go any deeper on it."
3,Good for a fun read--nothing more,"Say what you want, but this is no great American novel. The canvas is big enough, but the message and the observation lacks.While the Bonfire characters may have been flatter than a potato chip, the situations were hilarious and insightful because they were credible and real. Wolfe's insight provided images that I remembered 10 years after reading the book the first time around. But there was also a message concerning the future of NYC.This time around, the images are not as vivid. This due in part to the scope and length of the book. Characters appeared and disappeared without being ever heard of again, providing imagery or propelling the plot (why include them?) The Skeptics angle was too pat and made the novel feel like a Umberto Eco-for-Dummies rip-off. It is too bad that the message (race is the great political fireball in the US) got buried this time around. After all, it is a good message."
2,Have you read Babbitt ? Wolfe's work is an update,"Sinclair Lewis evoked a disturbingly similar emotion in ""Babbitt"", written in 1922. An interesting comparison of at least the 1920's to the 90's? Wolfe has done a reasonable update of Lewis' work."
4,Wonderful 90%. Capitulation at the end.,"Mr. Wolfe is new to me. This book shows his immense talent for developing characters and fascinating plots. I read until my eyes were bleary. But the ending is pathetic. Maybe Mr. Wolfe needed to consider earlier how to bring his plot to an end.So, ignore the ending. This is a book worth 90% of the read. I recommend it with the caveat that the ending is trivially ridiculous compared with the rest of the book."
2,High Hopes Dashed,"After the success of Bonfire, I had hoped that this book would be wonderful, even one of the great ones of our time. Not so. Instead of a recovery from his well-publicized psychological problems, for Wolfe this book seems more like therapy. He covers over 700 pages with cardboard characters, soap opera dialogue, B-movie action scenes, and formula-driven story lines, but only occasionally succeeds in compelling my attention. Perhaps the main problem is that among all the egos and libidos there is not one character who is complex or sympathetic. Required reading for cocktail parties, but otherwise a waste of time."
1,An insult to all Southerners!,"I thought that Wolfe was better than this trash! Both ""Bonfire"" and ""Right Stuff"" were much, much better. Having spent a number of years in Atanta, I know that the city is not perfect, but Wolfe attampted to cross an insane asylum and a prison camp, and it didn't work very well. The characters were shallow (at best). The book had little redeeming social (or otherwise) value. I'll take him off my list of ""authors to read""."
2,Commercial and boring,"Except for excellent descriptions of people and places this book does not capture the reader's imagination. None of the characters are sympathetic, and the plot is very shallow."
2,"Some wonderful moments, weak story, bad ending, disappoints.","I had hoped for much better. I read Bonfire, and enjoyed it, but felt that story had some weaknesses. This story is far, far worse. However, there are some sublime reading moments within (the quail plantation dinner, Martha's interactions with Ray, the jail tv room, the workout session at the bank). But you work much too hard laboring through the rest of it. This needed better editing. Wolfe should have negotiated for six more months to cut it back some, tighten the whole thing and come up with a plausible ending. The ending screams ""Deadline Panic."" Read the first half of the book, read about Conrad in jail and avoid the last few chapters. I imagine that Wolfe, if given the chance, could still make this into something most of us would enjoy, but as written the book is bloated, directionless and ultimately forgettable."
1,why use so many words and say nothing,I got tired of reading and nothing was happening-after 350 pages I gave up because I didnt care about any of the characters
3,"""MAN"" not up to expectations","Though this long novel contains many excellent passages which are a pleasure to read, it also wanders off course, contains filler and ultimately has an unbelievabe plot structure. It will not achieve the success of BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES and will probably fall from the bestseller lists when the hype has died down and enough people have read it for the word to get out."
2,A Man in Full,"I was enthralled with this novel, which seemed to have everything going: full-dimensional characters, twisting plot-lines, attention to detail, and Mr. Wolfe's outstanding prose. But ultimately, I was left feeling absolutely betrayed and cheated by the ridiculous and contrived ending concocted by Mr. Wolfe. It makes no sense to invest this much time and energy into developing characters ""in full,"" only to subject them to a fate right out of Mad Magazine or National Lampoon. One can only conclude that Mr. Wolfe, like his protagonist, lacked the energy and/or interest to resolve the ""tornados"" spinning in Mr. Croker's mind and simply left everything a mess for others to sort out. In the final analysis, you will be disappointed with this novel."
1,Trash,"If you're looking for a massive, trashy novel...this is the one! If, on the other hand, you're looking for something of substance...don't bother. The highlight (for me) centered on the stoic, Epictetus. The rest is just so much dirty froth."
2,The emperor has no clothes...,"Tom Wolfe's cumbersome epic features superficial characterizations, repetitive dialogue, a contrived plot and an ending that wholly relies on a device known in the film industry as ""Morris the Explainer"" to wrap things up. Depth, or what passes for it, is simply a vague ripoff of Stoicism. I waited for months to read this book and was profoundly disappointed."
2,Let's look down our nose at those horrible people,"Mr Wolfe has played me for a sucker - and at full price in hardcover. He seems to me to epitomise the very things he tries to satirise - give them what they think they want, puff it up with some clever quips, poke fun at turns of speech, give it much publicity and sit back and rake in the greenbacks. You do feel conned about 100 pages from the end as previously mentioned. But the part that sits least well in my view is the superior tone. Mr Wolfe doesn't seem to like much about any of his characters and it shows. Mr Wolfe may now be living off a reputation established a while ago. This book is a big let down and lightweight fare."
2,I was disappointed!,"I liked Bonfire of the Vanities a lot--it is one of my favorite books. So I looked forward to reading A Man in Full but I was really disappointed. I agree with the negative reviews. The characters--Charlie, Conrad--were somewhat interesting--but basically the whole thing seemed contrived, not very clever, depressing, and endless. One thing I learned from the book is that I don't ever want to live in or even visit Atlanta, or anywhere in Georgia for that matter."
2,Where's an editor when you need one?,"Tom Wolfe is a great writer, but ""A Man in Full"" is not even a good book. This tale (not all that profound to begin with) could have been told in not even half the space. Wolfe has famously disparaged some of his contemporaries (notabley Mailer and Updike) for not ""leaving the building,"" that is not getting out and observing how the world really works. Sorry, but Mailer and Updike were artists and ""A Man in Full"" is artless in the extreme. This is a thrilling ride for the first 250 pages or so ('The Saddlebags' chapter is brilliant), but, alas, there are over 500 pages after that, and only a dutiful reader will make it to the extremely disappointing end. This is an overwritten, extremely repetitious novel of, in the end, commonplace observations. This will not keep me from tackling ""I Am Charlotte Simmons"" in the near future, however."
2,So much written... so little said,"Never has so much been written about so little. This book is a real snoozer. There are way too many details, and the author tries too hard to be politically correct."
2,What happened to Wolfe's comic talent?,"Not by far as funny as 'Bonfire of the Vanities'. It is a reasonably entertaining story though, that you keep reading to find out what will happen, but not because of the writing itself. The book is also worth reading because of its illustrations of interesting things like the goings on in investment banking and how a bank attempts to retrieve a large loan from a company. And the life of a business tycoon, and prison life, and the world of illegal aliens. These illustrations would all be based on journalistic research and not on the imagination of the writer. What is rather fanciful is the enthousiasm of the young labourer for the writings of the Stoics, and the business tycoon transforming his life because of his teaching from it. But what I missed above all was the comedy that you expect having read his previous novel."
3,Where's the Beef?,"Lotta bun, some condiments, but no meat! Page after page of entertaining foreplay, but no climax and definitely no after-glow."
5,The Best of the Best,"I have reached literary nirvana with Tom Wolfe's outrageous, hilarious take on the 1990's, ""A Man in Full"". This is a masterpiece, with dead-on characterizations, no-holds-barred satire and discussion-provoking social commentary.Just the characters' names alone are priceless - Raymond Peepgas, Roger Too White, and Charlie Croker among them. Everyone is knocked here: the ego-inflated developer, the social climbing lawyer, the trophy wife, the pampered athlete. Sentences are worth reading two and three times to digest their full wonderfulness. No one can turn a phrase like Wolfe.Okay, the ending seems a little rushed. But events tie together in satisfying fashion, and I for one was sorry to see the novel end, even after 741 pages. It's the Great American Novel of the decade."
3,"A work of social,economic,racial insight and bad ending","Tom Wolfe is always entertaining and like any novelist of the first rank, insures that the reader will truly learn something about something. The work is centered on a developer, real estate magnate former football hero at Georgia Tech of years past who parlays his regional smarts into a fortune that has been pyramidded by debt and he is about to lose it all. Wolfe is absorbed in the work with ""massive chests, powerful hands, wrists,forearms,muscular backs,"" in his male leads as well as a facination with style and manners of all classes of Blacks/nee African Americans. It is marvelously readable to the last thirty pages whens it becomes obvious that Wolfe cannot resolve how to close it out. There are people in the book that deserve comeuppance while the main hero Charlie Croker is hardly a prospect for an evangelistic career and certainly not one to become an enlightened purveyor of Stoic thought."
3,"Good book, crappy ending.","I received this book as a gift. At first, I was totally put off by its length. Once I started reading it, though, I couldn't put it down.I found the characters interesting and the situations intriguing. As a Georgia Tech alum, I enjoyed the material about Tech and Atlanta. I found myself totally swept up in the book, choosing to continue reading it instead of doing other things. The stage was set for a tremendous ending, and then... blah. What a disappointment! It's like someone else wrote the ending, or Wolfe didn't have time to finish it, or something. From the press conference on, the book just didn't deliver. What a shame."
2,Why use one word when ten will do?,"The character development was interesting, and not at all difficult to keep apace. The plot line, or lines, has enough swirl in and out of focus to allow both the development of parallel themes, while reminding the reader that other things were going on, too.I would have enjoyed the book more if Mr. Wolfe had left something to the imagination besides the ending. Every scene, every line, even the accent of the main character, was described to a level of detail that only took 125 pages to become boring. Mr. Wolfe should appreciate his audience more, and regard their intelligence more highly. My lasting impresssion will be that I was insulted by a over-bearing, over-burdensome novel, that I wish I had not paid as much for it. It only needed to be about 325 pages long."
2,BONFIRE WAS BETTER,"When I started reading this book I thought it had potential to be as enjoyable as Bonfire. I was mistaken. Actually, the last two hundred pages were almost torture. The conclusion was terrible. Don't be fooled by all the hype!"
3,He cops out in the end...,"A good read, but even Wolfe's most devoted admirers really must not call this high art. It's artful, yes; shows craft, although I'll quibble with that as well. The characters are indivualized and iconic--kinda works, kinda doesn't. But I read it straight through in the few days immediately post-purchase, although I never did get all the way through Vanities (which I had also purchased upon publication).But what a cop-out epilogue! Maybe such reportage disguised as cocktail talk worked in Wolfe's New Journalism days (indeed it did, say I!),but we've just invested hours and hours in 700 pages of big personalities and big ideas and big money and big prose, and we're gonna settle for a Psycho-like epilogue? (I mean the original; I haven't seen 1998's, but have heard the psychobabble at the end is now truncated.)Next time he publishes, I'll wait to purchase Tom's dapper portrait on the paperback edition."
2,Good Atlanta Travelogue,"I must admit I read a few reviews before reading this book, and one phrase rang true to my take on this book; it was an amusing travelogue on Atlanta. I recognized most of the places mentioned and enjoyed reading about my city. It was fun reading a non-Atanta native's take on Our Town.But, oh yeah, the plot and the characters. The premise about the rape baffled me and was completely unbelievable and untenable. Was that the only way to bring these characters together?Next time I'll stick with Frommer's guide."
3,Weak finish,"While I thought Wolfe's descriptions of his characters were overdone, how many times does one have read about Charlie's manliness and the size of his chest, I found the story very intriguing. I couldn't wait to see how the story ended, but when it did I was very disappointed. The book went downhill after the final press conference. I thought Charlie's actions were completely out of character, even if he had undergone this new spiritual awakening. After spending hundreds of pages setting up the plot how could he tie everything up so nicely in a 10 page conversation between two characters?"
5,Tom Wolf has never written a bad book and this one is great.,"I'll be honest with you, I haven't always loved 'everything' Tom Wolfe has written, but I never read one of his books that I didn't like a lot. After reading a couple of press reviews, including RS, of 'A Man In Full' I was convinced and ordered it. I really enjoyed the story, the characters and the tight writing style. Not as exciting as Steiger's thriller, Alien Rapture, but an excellent read never-the-less. I've read thirty books from amazon this year and can recommend; Blood Work by Connelly, Cobra Event by Preston (Hot Zone), and best of all, Alien Rapture by Brad Steiger. All excellent reading written by the best."
2,disappointingly flat and limited,"I laughed all the way through Bonfire, but had only an occassional chuckle with A Man in Full. Only two characters develop, and only because Wolfe needs a story line. I hope I missed most of the jokes because I know the northeast well and have little experience with Atlanta. If this is true,it is a novel someone else would enjoy. However, it also means that Wolfe is not writing literature for all times, but local fiction about a particular era. (Better to read John Irving's Widow for One Year: it's full of unlikeable characters, but they're real and one cares about them.)"
3,Man in Full; Book in Three-Quarters,"This is a book about honor and redemption. It explores the implications of selling out by delving into the lives of people who have done just that. Some of the characters wrestle with their inauthenticity, most are clueless about it, and others celebrate it. Unfortunately, by the end we have no idea what to make of it all because, as many have noted here, Wolfe fails to deliver an ending that is satisfying. Nonetheless, the book is entertaining. It lacks the social bite and relevance of BONFIRE and RIGHT STUFF, but when it comes to Wolfe our expectations may be unreasonably high."
4,it's about male pride and folly,"Can't believe I'm adding to the 500+ list of reviews, but I haven't found anyone addressing what I think is the main point of this vast novel: male pride, male vanity, and male folly.The title begs the question, ""What constitutes 'a man in full'?"" And Tom Wolfe gives you pictures of some men to ponder.....Sure, the set pieces are wonderful - his eye is as good as it ever was. Would you invite him to YOUR house?? But I really do think his main theme is manhood in the late 20th century, and all the rest is window dressing."
2,"EGAD, WHAT AN ENDING!","WOLFE HAS CRAFTED AN INTERESTING PLOT WITH A VARIED CAST OF CHARACTERS, ALL DRAWN TOGETHER IN EVER-TIGHTENING CIRCLES. IT ALL WORKS WELL FOR ABOUT 650 PAGES AND KEPT ME PONDERING THE VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES FOR THE ENDING. WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! PREPOSTEROUS, RIDICULOUS, STUPID, TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE, IDIOTIC! WHAT HAPPENED? DID MR. WOLFE SUDDENLY GET SICK OF WRITING THIS STORY? KIND OF REMINDS ME OF GRISHAM WHOSE BOOKS SUFFER THE SAME DISEASE. THE NY TIMES REVIEW IS RIGHT ON THE MARK."
5,marvelously entertaining!,"wolfe is a master writer, his characters develop in such a way that they become larger than life --but still within reach for the reader to find ways to relate to them. the book is 742 pages long and my wish is that it would go on and on for thousands of pages. what entertainment! paraphrasing wolfe, i would ask, who ever said ""a man in full"" is to be regarded as literature of a shakespearean caliber? it entertains, period. and that is more than enough, period. let's just hope hollywood, that awful city of nightmares, doesn't make this into a movie. oh, the way they massacred ""bonfire of the vanities""!"
3,"Windy, Wordy, Wheezy","Just as the sartorial armor of teenagers is ridiculed here, this book is way too big and baggy for what it intended to cover. The characters and situations are hard to believe--and as a reader who has actually worked in a freezer, I can speak with authority on some of that. It is also very hard to look at the huge photo of a dapper Tom Wolfe, resplendent in his white suit and hat, and connect that with the message of less is more. A disappointing read--by the time it generated enough heat to warm me up, I was already frozen to death."
3,Aimed high got halfway there,"Maybe it's because I read ""The Triumph and the Glory"" and ""Mother of Pearl"" the week before I bought a copy of ""Man in Full"" but this new one from Tom Wolfe seemed to really drag in comparison. As an earlier reviewer pointed out, he spends way too much time describing objects and filling pages with tedious irrelevancies for my taste. I'm going to read ""The Right Stuff"" again so I can experience once more Tom Wolfe at his peak, because right now, he's in a galaxy far, far away."
3,short on content and characters,"Mr. Wolfe's new book is another vehicle in which his vivid descriptions and effective prose is evident. However, the characters are disappointingly lackluster. They don't inspire you or spark you enough to like or dislike them. This causes the book to drag a bit.Most enjoyable was his character Conrad; particularly his incredible streak of misfortune and his subsequent Phoenix-like rise from the ashes. However, all-in-all the other main characters were lacking, and the ending was a letdown."
5,Atlanta in Full,"Take a nice starting plot and an interesting lead character, and you have a book that traps you. Later in the story, it actually turns that the author's character Conrad is wandering about in search of a moral lesson.Hilarious characters make the demographic rifts as smooth as a truck on a truck lot. I quickly became enamored of the lesson from the Job-like character that abandoned his family and then spread the word to the lead character, who then left his family, to preach the word of Zeus.If it sounds great, its because it is. Re-read this book and venture into this story of deep characters."
4,I couldn't put it down,"For a week I read this book in any free minute I had. Engrossing characters and plot lines. However I was very disappointed with the ending,which needed a lot more development. The book needed to be longer, if that's possible. I recommend this book to anyone -- a little disappointment is worth the enjoyment of the other 650 pages."
2,A very very very long read but kept me going until the end.,"I have never read anything by Tom Wolfe although I did see Bonfire and Right Stuff in the Theaters and actually liked both a lot. This book is nothing like the other two stories, which isn't a bad thing. The author is has an amzing ability to weave a story and bring unlikely characters together. That said, I felt that some of the characters portrayed were somewhat weak in terms of being interesting or shallow in their developemnet. There were two fasinating characters that make this book worthwhile and that get you going until the end.The ending was a big disapointment that left you thinking why did I spend the time to get such a lousy forced climax. It is like a roller coaster with out a big drop.Over all the book had some real nice nuggets but but not enough of them to recommend it to a friend."
1,Beats sleeping pills anytime,"A Man in Full is a Book in Dull. I firmly believe that without the name Tom Wolfe on the cover, it would not have been published, it wouldn't have even found a literary agent. I didn't care for the characters and the story bored me to death-I used the novel to put me to sleep for two months, that's how long it took me to finish it. The sparkle and brilliance of his earlier work is completely missing here. Having written the above, now I confess that Tom Wolfe is my favorite author, and the two best books I've ever read were written by him: The Bonfire of the Vanities, and the much older The Right Stuff. Tremendous pity. No star given by this reviewer."
1,A Big Waste of Time,"After recently visiting Atlanta, I was looking forward to a good story and I was wrong!!. This book is deadly, too long, the characters are boring, and the words sometimes are so repetitive. Give me a good ol' fashion true southern novel any day."
4,Great Debut for Pop Brazilian Group!,"The Brazilian pop group ""Twister"" has produced overall an awesome first CD. This group, which has undergone some member changes since its beginning about a year ago, is to be applauded for its unique rhythms and deep, meaningful lyrics. Especially commendable is the ballad ""Perdi Voce"", as well as ""Si um Dia Eu Tiver Voce"", ""A Historia desse Amor"", and ""Foi Bom"". They're easy to listen to, with pleasant music and vocals. The song that started the whole ball rolling - ""40 Graus"" - is also good, although I personally prefer the others. For those who like harder rock mixed in, that is also included, and none of it totally displeasing to the ear. Let's hope that their second CD, which is supposed to be in Spanish, combines the group's talents to create an equally likeable collection of music."
2,Made in Spain.,This plane is not well finished and lacks an accurate depth adjustment. While it's cheap I think the also cheap Ryobi does a better job albeit without carbide blades.
3,Seems ok,haven't had a chance to use it yet but for the cost it certainly seems to be worth what I paid for it
4,Accomplished their purpose and beyond,I believe that the authors wanted to display the wonderful true life AIM lifestyle in fiction format and they have succeeded. Beyond that they have provided a fun yet very educational book. What better way to learn the ins and outs of network business than by an entertaining and enjoyable novel. They ought to make it into a movie! This book also dispels the common myths regarding the network marketing and restores dignity to this honorable profession.
1,Beware...this book is not so good,"I love books on artillery. I fully expected to get a book that had a history of U.S. artillery from--as the title says--The Spanish/American War to Present. What I got was an awful book with lousy production values that centered on a hodgepodge of photos about U.S. artilleryman UNIFORMS. Brother. The first couple of pages are color, and then the book descends into a morass of black-and-white photos. Now I know that a lot of (pre-color film) photos were created in B&W, but some are conversions from color to B&W...and very, very poorly done, at that. They're muddy; haven't been corrected at all, and the screening they did in production is abysmal. A real disappointment."
1,Poorly written,"A very poorly written, and ill reasoned book. Very biased against Israel. I would not recommend it at all."
4,Good price for nice Storage.,"I use this to store all of my DS and GBA games. I have about 30 GBA games and 10 DS games. While there is not much more room for anymore GBA games, I can easily fit many more DS games. I also store my DS(original one) along with my A/C adapter and headphones. The game it came with is fun too, if you are a DBZ fan. One annoyance was a large sticker on the case that was time consuming to remove."
3,Speed Training: How to Develop Your Maximum Speed for Martial Arts,"I have only just started to read the book, but so far it is very exciting with a lot of interesting information that I feel I could try out immediately."
4,"drills, drills, drills... good for an instructor!","the book starts of with the redundant primer martial art jargon... the body of the book is focused on explanations of different drills to enhance your speed... good ideas for instrustors... not all the ideas are praticle and the writer gives himself a glory ride, but overall a good book"
4,Good Info - with good drills,"I enjoyed Loren Christensen's SPEED TRAINING book and have used some of the drills and expalinations in my classes. Students enjoy the different approach and the fast paced drills. Earlier reviews discount the value of this book, but keep in mind no training book can offer all of the information on a given subject. This book has some great ideas and applies them with concise drills. I think anyone with an open mind would find this book a useful addition to their martial arts library."
5,Good writing style and advice,"This book will help you get faster if you do the drills. The author's writing style is clear and his real life anechdotes are fun to read.If you are a martial artist or better yet any type of athlete pick up this book, you won't regret it."
2,"Cool design, mediocre performance","The Grundig G4B is a good example of flash over substance. The radio is nicely designed, comes with a sharp leather case- when you whip this baby out, everyone will be impressed with your cosmopoliatan Euro-cool. Less impressive is the performance of this radio. Tinny audio, only fair fidelity on FM, and shortwave performance is pretty dismal. Sensitivity to weak signals is mediocre, selectivity (ability to separate closely-spaced stations) is poor, and the shortwave bands are full of noise from the internal synthesiser. If you really want to hear what shortwave has to offer, spend a little more and get a Grundig YB-400 or Sangean ATS 909."
3,A good alarm clock,"I bought this clock for going to college. I liked its look and the dual alarm it said it has. Though I was disappointed to find that it meant I can either wake to the alarm or the radio or one before the other. It has a very high setting that scares me awake some mornings! The snooze is good because the alarm has less and less time so you'll get up maybe out of sheer annoyance. Display is also nice to see and if its bright, you can turn it down. I recommend as a good general alarm clock."
3,Clarification,"The dual alarm isn't what I'd call a dual alarm. Yes, you can set two times, but only one can wake up with the radio, the other must use the buzzer. And you can't pick which is which, it depends on which time comes first. I can't say how well the clock works, I returned it after reading the instructions. Not what I was looking for."
1,Does it work?,"The clock radio has had problems and I've only had it for a week. One problem is the alarm, I can't seem to get it to work. The main problem is the display flicker's to the point where you cant recognize the numbers being displayed. I would return the item however the box was misplaced. I guess the old saying is ture, ""You get what you pay for!"" I wouldn't suggest this clock."
1,"Deceptive ""Dual Alarm""","I needed a dual alarm feature, and this was the only clock-radio left in Target that said ""Dual Alarm"" on the box. Now that I have it, I see why this was the only model left.What the box doesn't say is that one alarm setting is for the radio and the other is for the buzzer. Frankly the ""user manual"" doesn't explain this either. I didn't know that the buzzer and radio each had a separate alarm time setting until I read one of the other reviews here. The user manual could have been written much better.The physical design is poor. How many buttons does it take to implement these features: Radio on/off, setting the clock, setting alarm 1, setting alarm 2, and snooze? This alarm clock uses two 4-position slide switches and seven separate buttons. User-friendly this ain't. The goal of a good manual is to eliminate the need for product support. The goal of good product design is to eliminate the need for manuals. This product fails on both counts."
1,Watch out!,"I bought two of these. Both were defective and had to be returned. Both times the ""decrease time"" function was defective: the clock would not ""decrease time"" even though it had a button for this purpose.Note also that although the clock does have a dual alarm feature, only one of the alarm times can be set to the radio. The other alarm time must be set for the buzzer."
2,Not easy to program.,Dual alarm hard to program. Not easy to change alarm times. Don't know what button to push in dark to shut alarm off. Digits ok - bright and dim. Radio sounds ok.
4,Up On Time,"This fine alarm clock will wake the dead, (and my neighbors). Haven't been late to work since I plugged it in."
1,DONT BUY!!!!!!!!!!,"This is not a project pat CD. There is only one project pat song on this CD and its a song that didn't make the final cut on layn da smack down, which most pat fans have already heard. This CD is a disgrace to 3-6 and project pat. They should sue the mix tape gods for having there names affilated with this crap. Don't get me wrong some song are good but they are already on the original atists CD. I REPEAT THIS IS NOT A PROJECT PAT CD HE IS ONLY ON ONE SONG."
1,Do not buy it,"Bad quality, curve a picture on a jar and non original inscription on the bottom of the jar. And it's made in China, not in Germany, the jar have a sticker on the bottom"
2,I couldn't finish it.,"I was looking forward to this novel, having loved ""Bee Season,"" and even splurged on a hardcover copy. Alas, I only got a third through the book; it's somewhat dull. I asked a friend whether it was worth trudging through, and she said no, she'd only finished it on principle, without much enjoyment.I have faith that Ms Goldberg's third effort will be better..."
5,The best instrumental recording in 20 years,"This is the best new (not classic) instrumental jazz recording I've purchased in 20 years. It came out a decade ago so, nothing better ten years before it or after. And it holds up perfectly after a decade.It's hard-edged jazz, maybe acid-jazz, I don't know. Rock and jazz listeners with both likely enjoy it. The rhythms employed on some compositions are intricate and complex beyond belief yet they remain accessible. Kevin Eubanks demonstrates that, despite his hot and cold success as a leader (and despite renditions of ""Stairway to Heaven"" or whatever on The Tonight Show) he IS one of the most innovative living guitarists. Steve Coleman divides the meter so well you lose track of whether he's playing ahead of the beat or behind it. Unbelievable."
3,Not all that,"I bought this CD almost 20 years ago when it first came out and frankly I do not care for it very much. Of course it is very competently played and recorded, but the tunes are not very good, and I find that the sound of the alto sax in particular is harsh and jarring. Maybe I respect it, but I don't love it or derive any inspiration from it. The more I play it, the less I like it.This is, of course, a purely personal and subjective opinion, and you may love it very much, but make sure you listen to it before you buy and don't get carried away by the enthusiasm of other reviewers.Just as an additional note, I have never, ever seen this album mentioned in anyone's list of favorite jazz albums."
2,This person needs a ghost writer,After reading the first chapter I thought this person needs a ghost writer or someone to edit the book. It was disjointed and hard to read. It wasn't clear to me when she was following a myth or when she was following some historical writing.
2,For collectors of matri-potestal examples,"The maddening thing about this book is the way that it combines a celebration of behavior that defies our culture's traditional gender norms with gender stereotyping by the author. The most heinous example is the ending words of the book: Wilde tells us that in order for civilization to advance Reason [apparently exclusively male] had to conquer Mystery [the female speciality]. The book is rather disorganized, as if Wilde changed her purpose part way through. She looks at Central Asian warrior women, but rejects them as not matching closely enough with the Amazons' history/myth. Then she hops around in time and space recounting instances of feminine authority, especially in the religious sphere. Interesting little tidbits, but nothing really startling. No doubt this book will be someone's first encounter with these ideas, but any adult who hasn't heard these themes in the last thirty years hasn't been paying attention."
5,We love Tilly!,"Our Daughter LOVES this book. So much in fact, that she's going to be a little lamb for Halloween. Very cute & the illustration is super cute & colorful- perfect for LITTLE ones!!!"
4,The Truth Of It,"The official soundtrack to God of War 2 is a wonderful album to kick back and relax to. All of the great orchestral music from the game is found on this album.The album consists of 27 tracks in all, with the first 24 being music from the game, and the last 3 tracks being techno,metal and rap. Some people who review this album say that the extra 3 ""bonus"" tracks should not have been added to the cd. However, since the extra tracks are all together at the very end of the cd, one is free to listen to all of the music from the game all the way through without interruption.In conclusion, the soundtrack to God of War 2 is an excellent example of how games can sound just as stunning as any hollywood blockbuster. If you're not sure about buying it, websites such as Ciruit city, Walmart, and Amazon have song preview players that you can use. I enjoy being able to hear this music anywhere, and I hope that you will enjoy it to. Thank you."
4,Good Soundtrack!,"This is one great cd. If you love this game, pick up the cd now! The bonus tracks are the best of them all."
2,Lemon Squeezer,This is a little hard to work. It doesn't open all the way to insert the lemon. It takes some hand strength to squeeze it shut. Not something I will use much.
4,It works,"Great for one or just a few lemons. For a large batch we still like our old electric Braun.A good value in my book, it does what its supposed to do and is reasonably priced."
2,not durable,Broken after six uses (bent hinge pin). Of course at these prices I suppose it's considered disposable but certainly is inconvenient.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Buy a Stainless Steel Model. Mine broke after a few uses. Yes Stainless Steel costs more but so does a cheap squeezer that breaks.
5,lemon squeezer,What a great timesaving product. Easy to use and clean and no seeds to pick out of the juice. Get every drop of the juice. I have also used for limes & small oranges and tangerines.
5,Great product,"I love this squeezer. I drink at least 2-3 lemons worth of juice every day and I was so tired of the mess from sqeezing the lemons, they are sticky and so many seeds, plus I felt like I was wasting so much juice. This product is so perfect. I squeeze all my lemons in the morning and put the juice in a little tupperware to pour into my water, no mess, no seeds and it really gets most of the juice. Highly recommended!"
4,Working well so far!,"I've only juiced with this about a half dozen times, but it's working well and I have no complaints. The reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is that it does not feel as heavy-duty or solidly-constructed as other lemon squeezers I've used before. But, for the price, it's a great buy."
1,Not so great.,"I had another juicer at home, so I got this one for my office. It is much lighter in weight, and opens only to a 90 degree angle. The one I have at home is by Pampered Chef and costs more, but in my opinion is well worth the extra money. It narrows at the bottom so I get much more juice out of limes. This one arrived with some of the paint already missing. I should have returned it. Not happy with it at all. I ordered another one from Pampered Chef and gave this one away."
5,Nice Kitchen Gadget,This is a nice kitchen gadget to have handy. It is easy to clean and easy to store. I'm pleased with it.
1,Breaks after a while,"Broke right in half! Sure, probably a lot of juicers break after a while, but this one didn't exactly have a long life, so avoid it and go for the amco."
1,Broke the second time.,"My son and I made lemonade once, and it worked great. Squeezes a LOT of juice out. We just made lemonade again, and after a few lemons, the handle broke right in half. On top of that, whatever it's made of literally disintegrated into our already squeezed lemon juice. It was like metal dust, so we couldn't even make lemonade with the lemon juice we'd already squeezed!"
2,Look Elsewhere,"I bought this for making cocktails. I made MAYBE 8 drinks total before I heard a crack while using it. I looked carefully but I saw no damage. When I reached for it next, after having washed it, it was clear that the enamel had cracked in multiple places and the tool was now essentially useless. This is too bad as a good squeezer is apparently hard to find. Save your money. The damage was not due to excessive pressure or anything like that. Just a sub standard product in a product category that is hard to get a reasonable device for!"
5,a great debut,"The Charms first cd is reminicent of early Blondie. The hot blonde female singer and the ever present farfisa organ. It rocks a bit harder than those first few Blondie albums, but has a bit of the same light, fun feel."
5,Here I am to Worship - while parenting in the pew!,First I decided to read this book before giving it to my grand-daughter who has two pre-school children. Then knew it would be of great benefit for a parenting class.Excellent info for parents as they instruct their children to worship with 'Parenting in the Pew.' Currently I am leading a class at church using this book along with the Bible. It instructs all ages to 'worship' which is what we are to do for all eternity - worship the living LORD. So this is the most important lesson to share with our children or people of all ages.
4,Good guide for hassled parents,"This book encouraged my parenting views on worship. Remembering that we are in the sanctuary with our children to worship GOD and teach them to worship, is a great reminder for all of us. Starting Sunday with good conversation, a relaxed breakfast, and a godly focus, will definitely cause us to come before His presence with singing. Getting a head start the night before, so that we are prepared to worship. Great tips for how to go from ""what's in it for me"" to ""how I can teach my children to worship an awesome God""."
5,Moving portrait of life on The Last Frontier,"This is one of the finest books I have read about Alaska. This is a spare, unsentimental portrait of what life in Alaska is really like--both beautiful and harsh. This is not a book that romanticizes homesteading or the poverty of these homesteaders' lives; instead they come alive through the Brice's crystaline prose and her use of defining detail. Here is real life--people struggling to make lives for themselves in a country that is neither easy nor forgiving. The stark, black and white photographs that accompany the book add a beautiful and moving element. If you want to know what life on the frontier can really be like, read this book."
4,Brazil,"I bought this album after hearing Zero db mixes of Samba Do Gringo Paulista on 12"" vinyl. It is as smooth as the Bebel Gilberto album Tanto Tempo, which Suba has also produced. Yet this album is not as sweet. He shows us a darker, more shadey exploration into the world of Barzilian rhythms. I highly recommend this album. Other titles on Ziriguiboom to chek out are: The Other Side Of Outro Lado by Zuco 103. Bebel Gilberto - Tanto Tempo Remixes, varius producers from Chateau Flight to King Britt appear. To explore further out of Brazil and into other ethnic cultures give the Future World Funk series on Ocho a whirl. If you are new to world music these compilations are a good starting point. Combining Brazilian, Cuban, Morrocan, African and Indian music. Styles ranging from Dub/Raggae to Tribal House and Jazz."
5,Incomparable Reading of Poe by Basil Rathbone,"No other audio cassettes comes even close to the Basil Rathbone reading of Poe. It is the all-time standard and it makes Poe's poetry and stories come alive for children and adults alike. Were it possible to give it 50 stars, this reading would deserve it."
1,Nathan 22-Ounce Winter Bottle with Freeze Free Cap review,"The bottle works great, but the lid is extremely fragile. The cap broke off shortly after its first use. Good idea but, but a poor design."
2,Cap Breaks Easily,"Opening is a bit small, but it works. I dropped the bottle once and the cap's hinge broke, making the bottle worthless."
4,key tag,"Good quality, easy to use key tag. I was actually using them for a craft - placed stickers on them and strung them on ribbon to make a necklace. Worked perfectly. Only issue I had with this order was shipping took longer than usual but the product itself was fine."
4,A Fine and Subtle Album,"I don't quite know what ""scared"" the reviewer below, but this is a fine album by Abercrombie and Vince Mendoza, an ambitious NY musician who managed to write the orchestral scores for Joni Mitchell's new album and *stll* not get his named mentioned in the thousands of articles written on the album and the tour. Here he sticks to synthesizers, and because Abercrombie is also often playing synths, they combine to form One Mind, especially on the last three songs, with are quiet, ruminative, delicate meditations, perfect for a rainy day. If you loved the title track of Abercrombie's ""Timeless,"" you should pick this up."
5,A Great Read!,"I accidentally read this book before the High House, and I have to say The False House was easily as engaging as The High House. Evenmere is a wonderfully imaginative world that appeals to anyone who likes mythology, fantasy, hidden passages and sarcastic dinosaurs. This series is a fairly light and quick read. I'm glad to have stumbled on it, considering it is out of print!"
5,Excellent,"Excellent book, especially as the sequel to the High House. Can't wait until the third book is published, entitled ""The Winking"""
1,Will NEVER order from them again,"They shipped me the wrong item, then insisted they did not...In order for me to return the item I have to pay for return shipping and a restocking charge...I sent them pictures of what they sent me and it clearly shows it is NOT what is pictured on their website...Whoever updates their website put the wrong item code for the picture shown...The photo's were not proof enough for them...I was told to pay to return the item and they would make a determination at that time...You can not put the correct item in a box and basically call me a liar and I am going to pay to return the item to you and see what you decide? I don't think so...I called my credit card company and I am disputing the charges..."
1,Cheap junk,The pin screw isn't centered over the plate. The 1mm pin is very fragile and broke after removing two metal flywheels from an N scale train motor. Stay away from this.
2,Get with the program,"I found this book to be totally dry, behind the times and completely lacking in imagination. There are many good phlebotomy manuals on the market these days; most have useful, intelligent, up to date concepts and techniques. Many are even thought provoking. This book has no substance.I regret spending time and money on this edition and certainly wouldn't purchase it for the classroom."
5,Bought for my sister,"I bought this for my sister who is going to school and paid MUCH less than the price of the college bookstore. Got the same item for cheaper, what can beat that?"
5,WHAT A GOOD BOOK,"I do not know any thing about Phlebotomy,but when i got this book,i read it and i fall in love with it.I wish very body will try it and say so,i like the size of it and i am now doing the Phlebotomy course and hope to finish soon and i shall let any who ask me about it know. Thanks ."
2,Two out of five stars.,"Part numbers matched. The spindle arrived on time. Upon installation I found that all mounting holes were ""Un Tapped""! This was not a plug -n-play installation! Lucklly I had a tap and die set to make it right. The mower blade that came with it was way to big for the deck so I tossed it in the junk pile...... Next time I will think twice about using this vendor, and you know with riding mowers, there will always be a next time!"
4,"Love the nodules, but hard to get on and off the hitachi","I really like this attachment. To me, it helps diffuse the power of the wand. Even on low power, it tends to be too strong for my personal liking. I like how it kind of evens out the pressure. However, it was extremely difficult to get on my hitachi. Luckily, I just keep it on. If you plan just to use it on occasion, I don't recommend."
1,You don't really need it,"This goes on the Hatachi Magic Wand, and possibly others. However, it really dosen't add much to the wand. The Hatachi is all you need."
3,The perfect bathtub book,Entertaining and fast-paced - the character of Keller is very well done. Block manages to seamlessly incorporate humor and humanity with the macabre responsibilities of a hit man. Unique and interesting with more than a few grains of truth about the human psyche.
2,All Block's characters now sound the same,"Don't get me wrong: I'm a BIG Lawrence Block fan. I've read every book he's published since Matt Scudder's drinking days. But he's gotten soft and complacent in recent books. Yes, all his characters talk exactly the same: they all go into these silly off-topic tangents and have a wry humor that is just fine for Bernie, but is way off the mark for Matt or Keller. Block has drifted far away from his noir roots. Keller is not a cold blooded hit man, he's a transparent piece of cardboard. A real killer would have speculated about killing the kids playing basketball in the driveway, if that's what it took to carry out his contract. This is the first Block book in twenty years that I have put aside unfinished. A major disappointment."
3,Not up to Block's standards.,"This is not a novel: it is a marketing concept. The concept is to double dip by writing a series of stand-alone short stories that could be sold for big bucks to expensive glossies like Playboy, and then put them all together and sell them again to Block's regular readers. At some point in the book I realized that I didn't know the ""hero"", didn't have any feel for him, and didn't care about him. Another review here talks about one of the characters not being fleshed out. Actually, none of the characters have any substance. Block's previous works are great. Scudder is real; Keller is a non-person. Let's forget about him and get back to the good stuff."
4,A Hit Man with a Penchant for Self-reflection,"This is a very entertaining book.Keller is a hit man with a penchant for self-reflection. He goes to a therapist, enjoys his dog, and collects stamps. He has a mid-life crisis, imagining resettling into most of the cities where he travels to do a hit. He's indeed a sociopath, but one who the reader can feel some empathy for, somewhat like Tony Soprano.I also enjoy Block's Matt Scudder series, especially the following:Out on the Cutting EdgeandEight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder Mysteries)"
4,What a find!,"I'd never read any Lawrence Block before, and picked up ""Hit Man"" on a whim. What I found was an author who could write circles around a lot of his peers. This is a tight, deft narrative about a man we should despise. Instead, we come to care about Keller, and understand something of what drives him, of what makes him human. I really recommend this book highly, not just for entertainment value, but if you want to learn more about the craft of writing and how an effective narrative is constructed."
4,"Entertaining Read, Unique Perspective","This thriller written from the point of view of a hit man is a great book. It is entertaining and presents a unique protagonist - a hit man. His inner struggle with his career and his life are highlighted by the contrast of his work. He loves dogs, at least one of them, and is able to create real human connections, though something is always missing. He also turns out to be an avid philatelist towards the end of the book. One thing to note is that this reads like a collection of short stories more than a cohesive novel, but it works.If you want to read something that is outside the bounds of the usual mystery/thriller novel, this definitely fits the bill. Very creative and very well written . . . will definitely be picking up the others in the series. Highly Recommended."
4,Hit Man series is a Hit !,"I picked up a book by Lawrence Block while I was on the waiting list at the local library for a book by another author... I was hooked. I have read the cat burglar series, the Matt Scudder series and the Hit Man series...He is a very entertaining writer and I highly recommend his books!"
5,HIT MAN. What a hoot!,"I finished this book with a rollicking laugh--loud and long.I suspected tongue-in-cheek early on (""Call me Tex.""?) butcouldn't be absolutely certain at that point. Had the suspicion not lingered, however, I doubt whether I could have continued to read through to the end. Indeed, the uncertainty was what kept me turning the pages. I had to know. I have to say, though, that had the finish revealed a HIT MAN to have been taken seriously, I'd have been angry for failing to sense that direction and for wasting my time and energy reading something I'd have found quite unpalatable. (All shadows of all doubts were convincingly erased with the introduction of philately.) I wonder how many authors could have pulled this off successfully.Thanks, Mr. Block, for a deliciously spicy read. Now, how about more Matt Scudder."
2,Not vintage Block,"While I never tire of Block's style and his ability to shape characters, I found this book to be 'Seinfeld-ish'. It was over 300 pages about nothing."
2,Boring - man just doing his job.,"This book makes me yawn. Basically, this is a story of a guy who likes dogs. He is a contract killer. This could as well be written about a guy who is a postal worker, a programmer, or a manager. You might expect something more -- after all, he is a hit man. But it is a pathetic story of someones pathetic life lightly seasoned with pathetic humour."
3,Hit Man,"This is not a very good book. It don't have a mistery to be solved, it don't have a plot that take us awake to the last pages. But it have a great writer beyond it. And every time that Lawrence Block writes a book you can believe it will entertain you. It's amazing how he can make a killer such a good character. Sometimes the book becomes dark and you have to stop reading and take a time, because of the way Keller (the killer) faces the death of his targets and how he doesn't feel a thing when it happens for him to kill the wrong ones.It's definitely not my king of book, but as an unconditional Block books reader, I recommend this one."
1,Sorry,"I kept waiting for a plot to arrive and one never did. A guy goes around mindlessly killing people and then collects stamps. And then the book ends, which I find to be the best part. It's finally over. Pointless."
1,bad,after i got to part w/psychologists wife and dog i closed the book-forevermore...this book didnt even attempt to be credible. This author actually makes a living doing this?!....wow...i imagine the only readers who enjoy this book are used to crap...back to raymond chandler for me
1,Not Good,"The book was written well by the author but only in his use of words. I felt by the limited experience of the author it really didnt do the subject matter justice. Keller seemed as though he was in a daze most of the time and in dire need of mental confinement. This character lacked the true emotional stability necessary for his line of work. Furthermore, the character remained so unfocused throughout his ""hits"" that it seemed highly unlikely he could have completed the contracts or get away with the act. The ""hits""and there descriptions were so novice that had there actually been a real need for an assasination I doubt very seriously that the author could have interpreted it to paper.P.S. I read both Hitman and Hit list and neither was worth the time nor the effort."
4,A Good Poolside Read,"I usually look through the mystery section every once in a while but on a recommendation, I started looking through Lawrence Block's writings and was intrigued about Hit Man. Hit Man is a collection of stoires about an assasin named Keller who incidently is going through a mid life crisis. While Hit Man isn't exactly heavy stuff, it is a fun read. I'm looking forward to picking up Block's sequel, Hit List next."
5,It's a Keller-diller,"I see that most people enjoyed this book,too I finally figured out that most people wouldn't read a book all the way through unless they liked it anyway, hmm? Years ago I heard John Cheever lecture and I asked him what his favorite books were and he said ""Anything I can get through the first three pages of.""I found ""Hit Man"" to be a metaphor for ""Novelist."" Keller lives other peoples' lives, wants to be them or live where they live, and then has to kill them (read: end them). As a fiction writer I have sometimes felt this way - sort of ""empty"" - and so I have to ""fill myself up"" with imaginary lives; I'm happiest when I'm ""into"" my characters; in fact, sometimes it gets kind of scary.I identify with Keller's...identity problem."
3,This is NOT a How-to book.,"The story is interesting, but the actual crimes are reruns of what we've all seen in the movies and on TV a thousand times. Some civil libertarian groups were fighting to keep this book on the shelves on First Amendment grounds. They obviously hadn't read the book itself before starting to waste their time. The book's main character is interesting. It's mostly a psychological look into an ethical hit-man's mind. (Hey, it's just a job.) To me the most interesting character is a minor figure, the hit-man's female intermediary. Overall, this is a different read and a nice change from the usual murder mystery. But a manual on how-to-do-in-the-neighbors it's not."
4,"Even when he's boring, J.P. Keller is interesting","I've never read Lawrence Block before, but after being introduced by a mutual acquaintance -- J.P. Keller -- I will again. Keller headlines a unique page-turner here: He's a hit man who's not a good shot, not a tough guy...but who is the kind of neighbor you'd want to take in your mail when you go on vacation (unless he had to leave town to kill someone).There's not much action here, very little danger, not much suspense -- but page after page, Keller stays interesting. Even when he's boring -- walking his dog or collecting stamps, for goodness' sake -- he's fascinating. The dialogue -- between Keller and Dot, between Keller and his psychiatrist, between murderer and various murderees -- pops. Hit Man isn't a typical mystery thriller, but that's one reason why it's very enjoyable."
2,what's the plot?,I really don't know what was the plot of this one. You'll read about going to everywhere in the US and how to walk with a dog and about stamps and what's the plot? He killed many people but that won't thrill you a squat.
2,What was this supposed to be?,"This book never really does anything. A hit man wanders around, kills people, contemplates life, almost get a life of his own in the form of a dog and a girl, but then both of them just disppear from the story, leaving our lead to wander around until the end. What's the point?"
2,Very Strange,"This was a very strange story. I couldn't wait to finish it. Not because it was so interesting, but because it was so depressing. Keller is very good at what he does but his life is dull. Maybe that's Mr. Block's point. A hit man is just another poor slob trying to get through life, doing what he does best and trying to make sense of it all. The title for this book really should have been, ""Hit Men Are People Too""."
2,Character Study,"I am a Matthew Scudder fan and have read and enjoyed a few of those mysteries. I saw Hit Man and decided to read it.It's just a character study of a hit man more than a book with a beginning, middle and end. He grows throughout the book, but who cares? I skipped whole sections in the back about stamp collecting. Just kill some more people why don't you? If we wanted to know about feelings, we'd read Jane Eyre.The humor is really lame, too. I found myself rolling my eyes a few times; very juvenile. It was like evesdropping on two highschoolers."
3,Why a 10 indeed??,"This book is very average. This is not a compliment. Readers who gassed all over the place and gave it a 10 need to start reading some better books!. For example, the character of Dot is not fleshed out. She's witty and sardonic, but is she Maude or Mary Tyer Moore? I agree that after 180 pages, this story went nowhere. The stamp thing was pointless since Keller did not change his work. The fact that he was almost never caught or in danger was ridiculous."
3,I recommend this book,"This is my first Lawrence Block novel, and I enjoyed it a great deal. It was a surprising book, while at the same time having some plot twists that you see coming. I say it was surprising because of the books moral stance. It doesn't judge this character's career choice the way you might expect (or might not...hey maybe it's just me). It almost seems like a documentary, and if I'd read this in some other form, not knowing it was a novel, I would totally have believed it was a true story. I also like the ""Dot"" character. She was plucky and strong, and well written for a female character by a male author. I also liked the understated tone of the narrative, and the restraint from overly morbid descriptions. I could have done with less of Keller's introspection, though."
3,Nigel,"For someone as erudite as Nigel, I'm surprised that he would confuse an op-ed piece for valid philosophy."
2,Treasure?,"This was the first disc released in the big remastering project of 2005 for the Herb Alpert and the Shout Factory's catalog. A really nice business move Herbster!""Lost Treasures"" has twenty two previously unreleasd tracks or should I say leftovers, as I hear 'em. I found only a couple of these ""Lost Treasures"" tunes worth the purchase. I really think Herb should have dropped the ""Lost Treasures"" idea and placed these leftovers at the end of the each album from which they came. In other words, good ol' bonus tracks. The 2005 version of ""Whipped cream and other delights"" does have a couple bonus tracks, which don't appear here, but could have. The other studio albums could have used some of these ""Lost Treasure"" out-takes, but no.Buyers beware, unless you're a Tijuana nut."
3,Best bang for the buck!,"I shopped this item to death....... [ product cost and shipping ].....ended up getting 10 sets of two. Drilled a small hole to add a tie to secure to my trailers, chipper, in the trunk of my car.....""I felt like the Chock King for a while"".....but at least I think I sleep better now."
5,better safe than sorry,"I'm paranoid about my camper rolling out on me, so I always chock the tires. Can't be too safe with a 4 and 2 year old inside and around the camper. I might be overly cautious, but who knows what can happen if a jack slips. The work great. I keep them inside the camper so I never have to go looking for them."
5,Wheel Chock,This product is compact in design and bright yellow in color so I will not leave it behind when leaving the campground. When ordered it came in quickly and the price was good. I now have 4 all the same.
4,Work very well,"The chocks are easy to carry and very easy to use. They hold my 5000lb trailer easily on slight inclines. Since I got them I notice there are models that you can also use for leveling. I might have rather had something like that, but these are very good for what they are intended."
4,Monique Parent a babe,"Sultry and sexy Monique Parent and Jennifer Burton play girlfriends who get off on voyeurism,fantasizing,and sharing their husbands. eventually their shenanigans put a strain on their friendships and marriages.That leads to breaking up and making up. Of course the situations are all implausible,but you don't watch a erotic movie for its plot,and this movie is no exception,the sex scenes are good,the women fine!! and the movie doesn't come off as corny or stupid, and when you consider the alluring quality of Monique Parent who in my opinion is the prettiest and classy in all soft porn. No movie with her in it disappoints, On the whole this is one of the best movies of its type."
4,Perfection On Ice! Hockey Instruction At It's Best!,"Some ""thinking outside the box"" hockey ideas thatleagues, coaches and parents should review. The practiceorganization has purpose, meaning and gives results!CHAMPIONSHIP HOCKEY DRILLS will make you feel like throwingyour hat on the ice in celebration! Excellent stuff!"
1,Dosen't work with Palm 3xe,"I recently purchased and returned one of these cases. Unbelievably, my new Palm 3xe would not fit this case. The unit just barly slides in, to the point where it took me serveral minutes to pull it out. Is the Palm 3xe slightly bigger than the older units? I don't know, but regardless this dosen't work.As far as the quality of materials used, they seemed good, but not great. Definatly dosen't seem worth the $30 Palm charges, even if it had fit my particular unit."
3,"Come on, it's a belt clip!","When evaluating this product for yourself, I suppose the most obvious question to consider is, do I want a belt-clipping case for my Palm Pilot? If you're me, you don't. Let's face it, there are enough unfounded stigmas about Palm Pilot users out there without us purchasing belt clip ""palm pilot holsters"" to perpetuate them! I, for one, refuse to attach my Palm Pilot to my belt, and I hope you will join me. Consider a sleeker, more pocketable case."
4,Good product ... but be careful when use it with your Palm,"This is a good product for carrying and protecting your Palm organizer. Yet, sometimes I found it difficult to take the case off my belt, and be careful when you do that with your Palm inside the case. I would suggest to take your Palm out first, and then take the case off your belt so that you'll not possibly 'crack' your Palm's screen."
4,It's a steal for less than $20,"This case has so far been perfect for carrying my TRGpro on clinical rotations as a medical student. The TRGpro (same size as a Palm III) fits in the case snugly with the cover still attached and slides out easily. The case clips to a belt or scrubs without a problem and hasn't even come close to falling off. Durability may be an issue as I've noticed some seams at the top of the case are already appearing frayed (after only 2 weeks of use), although none have actually broken. Otherwise it's a great buy at ~ $17.00."
3,Be careful in your car...,"There is one big problem with this product: when you sit in a car seat, there is very little room for the PDA, what with seat bolsters, seat belts, consoles, and the like. Unless your Palm hangs in an open area, pressure on it can cause it to twist, which can result in damage to the internal electronics. In my case, I have experienced random power losses resulting in resets, and I have had to order a new Palm. I am looking for a belt-wearable hard case.This case works very well otherwise."
1,may actually cost $100!...,"The Palm III is just a great thing you want to carry everywhere with you. This case just looked great and I would tend to trust 3com for the quality of their products... Bad idea. The day after I bought this case, I found a nice crack on the screen of the palm. No way to know what happened but I did not do anything special and can not remember any peculiar shock. I must have just carried the palm in the case on my belt most of the time, and in my front pocket one hour as I used to do before to buy the case... Sad story, I will end up with the fast but expensive ($100) replacement program of 3com. Think twice before you buy this item!"
4,Timeless...just absolutely timeless!,"I purchased this on vinly back in 1977 when I was just 14 years of age. I purchased it because I loved the tune ""Angels"" which was getting a lot of airplay here in the Philly area. I wasn't expecting very much simply because this was my first time hearing of Flora Purim. Boy was I surprised!! I fell in love with the entire album! I discovered that ""Angels"" only scratched the surface. I fell in love with the title tune, along with ""Fairy Tale Friend"" and ""You Love Me Only"" just to mention a few. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who wants to find out about the true beauty and diversity that is Flora Purim. I believe you will find the music to be timeless..absolutely timeless!!"
4,Obscure little gem from the 1970s,"Recorded in NYC and originally released on vinyl in 1977, `Nothing will be...' is from Purim's most productive creative period as a Brazilian political exile in the USA.This is fine jazz from the classic fusion period, ambient but with a hard edge. Purim's very distinctive voice is a natural gift for the jazz idiom. She sings some numbers in Portuguese, and some in her (delightful Portuguese-accented) English. A great number of session musicians - including Airto on percussion - contributed to the sound, and even `handclaps' are credited (!).If you like high-quality vocal-led jazz, check it out. It's great mood music, and has a timeless quality which still endows it with a contemporary feel."
5,Excellent Camera,My husband and I bought this camera and took it on vacation with us. It never got sunny but you wouldn't know it to look at the pictures. Sorry I didn't buy it from Amazon - thier price was ~$100 less than what we paid. END
1,Froze up at the worst possible moment,"I purchased this camera in August of 98, and moved overseas. In January '99, my eighty-one year old father was riding on the back of an elephant in Thailand. When I went to take a shot of this once in a lifetime event, the camera lens froze in the out position and would not take a picture. A moment lost forever! Attempts to get the camera fixed overseas were futile, as they would not honor a US warranty. I sent several emails to Olympus asking some direction but received no response.Also, soon after we purchased this model, my husband and I stood side by side taking the same picture with this and a Samsung comparable model, both on automatic, and found the resulting pictures to have no noticeable difference. Due to the lack of email response by Olympus, I would hesitate to buy another, as this one was money down the drain."
4,Brilliantly Charming,"Set in a small Irish town, ""Waking Ned Devine"" explores what happens when a man, (that would be Ned Devine), wins the lottery. The only hitch is that he is dead, and no one knows but his two chums. The antics of the two guys, along with the rest of the town's colourful characters, are the basis of the movie's humour and fun.The characters and the actors portraying them are really what make the film, and make it something special. At times, the humour is quite slapstick, but mostly situational and carried by the actors themselves.""Waking Ned Devine"" is a charming movie deserving of every praise. It is a great night's entertainment, and wonderfully crafted.If you have not seen it, why are you still sitting here?? Go! Watch!"
2,Ned Divine picture format size!,The movie format is not full screen. It takes up about a third of the screen if that. Very disappointed. Don't know if it is available in full screen. But how do you know?
4,Good English humor,"You may have to listen close to the Irish dialect, but this is a good ""reap what you sow"" story, as well as being funny."
5,This one sparkles!,"Clever story-telling, subtle character studies, delicious Irish humor, and a wonderfully silly plot combine to make ""Waking Ned Devine"" a delight. I laughed, giggled, snorted, and cried.Ian Bannen and David Kelly are ~ respectively ~ the brains and the heart of this story, but be careful not to overlook the remarkable supporting cast. Each one adds flavor and dimension to an already colorful fairy tale.A beautiful and deceptively simple film."
5,Charming and Witty,A true foreign masterpiece. I loved seeing This movie and was able to watch it with a mixed audience. The movie was charming and witty. Although it was far fetched at times it was a comedy afterall. I am glad that so many people have enjoyed seeing this one. I can't wait til the price drops so that I can pick up my copy for my video library. It was a joy watching and I would like to see it again and again and again !!!
4,Great Irish film.,"I really enjoyed this Irish film. If you have a hard time understanding the dialogue, turn on the subtitles."
5,"a lovely spot to live, die, and be remembered","This movie is so charming and delightful that I had to watch it twice, just to get back to that wonderful place. The characters are such fine people - wouldn't you like to know every one of them - and they're all amazingly real and believable, which is surprising, given the fantastic circumstances. I even believe that the Water Horse is still there in the lake, bigger now no doubt, but still pleased to come whenever a boy whistles.The scenery was breath-taking; the music was hauntingly beautiful. The funeral scene, the final song, oh, just everything about it was so solid and good. Lots of little treasures, too: like when the main character is giving a speech and his wife silently steps through the door into the back of the room. The change in him while he continues the speech - the quiet love in his eyes - it is a lovely thing to experience. And let me just add that the experience is so worth repeating.Think I'll go and watch it again."
5,Waking Ned Devine,"Waking Ned Devine is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, funny and entertaining. It is a movie that I will recommend to my friends and that I will watch again."
4,Charming Irish Flavoured Comedy,"Set on a small Island off the cost of Ireland this has a Father Ted feel to it. This is both a good thing and a bad thing, since there is a tendency to rely on cosiness when portraying the Republic in film and television, and to populate beuatiful scenery with stereotyped ""Eejits"". To some extent Waking Ned fals into this trap, but it is saved by a Ted-like anarchy and a better than average plot. It's also great to see David Kelly in particular in a starring role, he will be familiar to fans of Fawlty Towers as O'Reilly the builder."
5,One of my favorites,"I cannot say how many times I've seen this movie but I never tire of it. The characters are wonderful, the scenery breathtaking and I'm left with a smile on my face at the end. Makes me want to be Irish! What a charmer!"
4,Review for waking Ned Devine,"I absolutely love this movie, and I was so happy to find it for so cheap on Amazon.The sound is a little bit wierd. Kind of hard to hear--maybe the music and background is too loud, and the voices are not loud enough."
5,Delightful,"I never get tired of this film or it's music (and I rarely go for soundtracks, but I picked up this one). Leonard Maltin's movie book calls this a ""slight"" film but I find it huge on charm and heart. It's a well-paced, old-fashioned caper story in which all but two residents (approximately 52 to begin with) of an impoverished remote rural Irish village conspire to collect the big lottery when their old pal, Ned Devine, has died in the excitement of learning he's won. Of the two exceptions, one is the head priest who is conveniently out of town when the story is set in motion and the other is a humorless old crone who threatens to tattle. You can't help but cheer on the chicanery in a film where the humor ranges from the black to the silly to the sentimental. Seems to me the only person who will not be won over by this movie is a humorless old crone. The scenery is stunning."
4,great little movie,"This is a movie without sex or blood but with a plot. It has well developed characters and subtle, dry humor."
3,Waking Ned Devine,The DVD was in very good condition but we were disappointed about the swearing...used the Lord's name in vain frequently.But that isn't Amazon's fault of course. Just giving our opinion of the movie.
4,"Oh, that someone will speak this highly of me at my funeral...","To say this movie is funny is just not saying enough. It speaks of Irish traditions, human nature, the good, the bad and the funny, and gives you the nervous jitters as to what is going to happen next.But, the ending scene with song will bring tears to your eyes or at least a lump in your throat. The tune is ""Parting Glass"" and the words are humbling.We loved this movie!"
5,Quirky Comedy at It's Best,"I first watched this movie 3-4 years ago. Other than BBC productions for public television, I hadn't much experience with ""foreign"" television or movies. I've watched it more than once and I just loved it. It was so entertaining. I loved the characters, the setting (village) and the mischief of the main characters."
3,Nice and fun.,"This movie is not bad, worth to see. Within 90 minutes they've done well with all of the characters. Each characters have their own role. Especially, the main cast, 2 old men with their great action. Plot is simple but still great. This movie is fit to watch while we need little break."
2,Waking Ned Devine,"Unfortunately I cannot play this DVD as my player is unable to read it in Australia and I will have to look into having it made compatible. Shame really as I had looked everyone for this DVD and was so pleased with myself for managing to get hold of a copy... So at this stage can't rate it. Cheers, Debbie"
1,A word to the wise,"Before I purchased this DVD, I didn't know about ""Region 2"", namely that I couldn't play this DVD in whatever region the state of Connecticut is in. The DVD is totally useless to me and would love to know how either to return it or somehow get my money back. The bottom line is that I still haven't seen the movie and will have to repurchase it again. Just alittle word to the wise........."
2,It was a letdown for me,The movie you REALLY want to see is The Englishman who went up a Hill or Local Hero. Waking Ned Devine did not have any of the small town pranks that I expected. What a wasted premise!
5,great band,i bought this cd almost 2 months ago and i'm STILL listening to it! my favorites:tir aux pigeonsgentlemanwho's gonna singdanse sur la merdebut the whole album is great!
1,The Plantation,Sick. It seems that the only purpose is a medium to describe sadism and torture at its worst.
3,DOn't visit the Plantation,Thought this book was a little over the top. Was expecting something a little better.
1,racist trash,"Wow! This book is really poorly written- and I would feel bad for Kuzneski and give him credit for a ""good try"" if he wasn't such a racist homophobe. This book is racist to the point of being propoganda. I am glad it is poorly written."
2,Predictable but kind of fun,A bit disappointing and loaded with cliches and less than believable heroics. But it keeps your interest in spite of its inadequacies.
1,Lousy book. Do not waste your time or money.,Terrible. Couldn't finish. The story is nonsense and the writing ridiculous to the point of being comical. I am completely baffled that any serious reader would recommend this POS to anyone else.
1,Couldn't read it,"I really don't like to write negative reviews and usually don't, but the fact it that this book was so ineptly written that the writing itself distracted me from whatever story it had to offer. I got about twenty pages into it and gave up, just couldn't read it. The prose is absolutely awful and sophomoric, splattered with unnecessary adjectives and riddled with too cute dialogue.Now, here's the thing. I read another book by this guy, since it was recommended by Amazon, and managed to get through it, mediocre as it was. After all, I did pay for it. So, maybe he's learning and getting better. I do not want to absolutely castrate a new writer with a scathing review, although I have done so. I hope he keeps learning and maybe gets to the point of actually being readable.By the way, I couldn't get away with no stars here, so had to give it one. And so it goes."
4,Brilliant,After reading all other books by this author I wanted to find the first. How good is it!! Great read with never ending entertainment. Could not put it down..
1,Racist and distasteful,"I found Plantation to be terribly offensive. I wanted to like the book and was interested in the bromance relationship of the main characters early on, but the story devolved into racist claptrap. The casual way a black character was called a 'buckwheat' throughout the course of the book was appalling. The villains in the book, all black, had paper thin motivations for their crimes and were written as total lackwits in the final encounters of the novel. To refer to this book as racist is just beginning to describe the irresponsibility of it, steer clear of the Plantation."
3,Pretty average 1st novel,I found this book a little over the top. It was more like reading a Cussler novel than a suspense thriller. Overall it was ok. I am into the 2nd book of his and find that much better.
3,Story was alright - Narrator was really hard to listen to...,"I listened to The Plantation a few months ago. It was 13 CD's I believe, and it took me more than half way through it to adjust to Dick Hill's (the narrator's) voice. He speaks very slowly, and it's as if he's got cotton mouth or dry mouth or something (I kept saying to myself as I was listening, ""drink some water"" ~ it's terrible. I almost didn't want to listen to it, but I did because the story itself kept me wanting to know what was going to happen. If I pick up another audiobook and Dick Hill is the narrator, I will NOT listen to it. This is the first book I've listened to by Chris Kuzneski; I don't believe I'd be waiting on baited breath to listen to another..."
4,Great reading!!,"Unfortunately, I don't get much time to read for enjoyment. Once I started this book, there was no stopping me! Great suspense, interesting storyline. I was bummed when the story was over!! I'll look forward to more Jonathan Payne action! Nice job and congrats Chris!!! :-)"
4,Another Mem Fox Gem!,"My son got this for his 2nd birthday and enjoys hearing me read it a lot. He loves to yell out ""MOO!"" at the end. The illustrations don't interest him so much, but that's fine. He still enjoys the story. We've not found a Mem Fox book yet that we don't love!"
3,it's useful,te wallet's useful and has lots of pockets. I don't like that it doesn't have a zipper pocket for change tho. It's a little inconvenient.
1,good stroller but bad car-seat,This is uglyiest stroller i have ever seen!THe carseat won't even fit in our car and we have a exterra we only have 1 more seat and we can barly fit it in.When i am suppose to carry abby into a store or somthing the carseat weighs me down i bet it weighs 45 pounds no lie.the only thing good about it was it is easy to push and mom loves it so does dad if i ever have a kid don't count on me buying my baby one of those things. Thanks for your time
1,I want my money back!,This case was such a rip off! The velcro closure became detached from the leather after just 2 months. I'm so upset that the case that my husband bought for his handspring for just $4 more was 100 times better in quality and looks!...
1,A good idea frustrated by poor design.,"The PalmPilot leather case is an attractive way of carrying and storing your PalmPilot.However, the industrial strength velcro fastener that attaches the PalmPilot to the case is simply a bad idea. The Palm Pilot must be detached from the case every time you HotSync and this is annoying and inconvenient. But of even more concern is the fact that this frequent unfastening flexes the PalmPilot case, which in my case resulted in major damage to the electronics inside the device. There are better designed cases on the market which are more convenient and don't pose a threat to your PalmPilot."
2,You may want to consider something else,"This case has a serious flaw with respect to the velcro on the strap that holds the case closed, as it wears out quickly and will not remain closed. This may be an isolated occurance, and then again it may not be. If I were you I would consider another brand. Im sure you would agree that if this case will not remain fastened it is not performing its primary function very well at all."
1,"Poor design, better cases exist for same price",The 3Com 10123U Leather Belt Clip Case is significantly superior to this case because 1) nothing attaches or adheres to the Pilot and 2) it protects the Pilot on all sides instead of having 3 of them exposed. It velcros from the top and the Pilot slides out easily. A much better buy at about the same price.
4,"Of course, it could have been better, but ...","It's mostly an 80's ballads decent collection. Sounds great on a roadtrip or as background for a romantic dinner. I give it 4 stars because at least one Guns'N'Roses ballad could have been included, and the choice for a couple of artist is not the best, but good collection overall. Great sound fidelity too."
4,A Will Be Well,For fans of John McGahern his memior will give you insight into his characters in Amongst Women and The Dark. Well worth the read to know an author and his thoughts.
3,WEIRD!!!!!,"Yes, the audio is very faint and muddled, and having no subtitles certainly didn't help. It can be very expensive and time-consuming to restore the old soundtracks from the 30's, even more than restoring the film. But I believe that it is just as important as the visual qualiy, if not more so. Of course Charles Laughton is the most entertaining character in this film. I have only watched it once and I was left feeling unsatisfied like I did with The Ghoul, but I will give it another shot. I hope everyone knows that Whale, Laughton and Ernest Thesiger were all as gay as a pink slipper. It even seemed like there were hints thrown into the dialogue at times. It gives me the idea that they were having kinky, opium-fueled gay orgies after the shoots. Woo hoo hoo hoo!"
5,the 1 star reviews are non-sense.,"I must say the people that gave this film 1 star really don't know what they're talking about. This movie has a wonderful dark and scary atmosphere and the black humor is second to none for films of that era. James whale made a great film, truly a gem of a horror movie, especially if your a fan of horror films of the 30's and 40's or a fan of James whale. The only thing more I could ask, is to have this film re-done on DVD by criterion."
1,The title says it all!,"A relentless thunderstorm forces an odd assortment of travelers to seek shelter in an isolated country house. There, they meet a sinister, ill-tempered old woman and her bitter, cowardly brother. They have potatoes for dinner. There are flickering lights, strange noises, and crazy relatives locked in the attic. And Boris Karloff is the butler. You can see Gloria Stuart, now famous for her role in Titanic, in one of the films that inspired her to quit show business the first time around."
5,Karloff is Creepy as Ever,"After getting lost in the Welsh Mountains a group people seek safety from a raging storm at a nearby creepy old mansion. The house is occupied by a strange group of people to include Morgan (Karloff - his first staring role) who is a mute butler, who becomes dangerous when drunk. The secret of The Old Dark House is revealed!The movie has a number of stars or soon to be stars:Boris Karloff - Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, The Mummy, etc.Raymond Massey - Things to ComeMelvyn Douglas - Tonight or Never, The Vampire BatGloria Stuart - Secret of the Blue Room, The Invisible ManCharles Laughton - Island of Lost Souls, Mutiny on the Bounty, Hunchback of Notre DameErnest Thesiger - Bride of Frankenstein, The Man in the White Suit, The Robe"
3,"Nice, eerie little thriller for a dark and rainy night at home!","Effective, occasionally creepy little suspense thriller, featuring Charles Laughton and an unrecognizable Bela Lugosi, about a group of strangers forced to hole up in a gloomy, decaying old mansion on a hillside, during a torrential rainstorm that's threatening to wash the hillside away. Turns out, of course, that what's in the house (wacky brother and sister, a servant that looks like the love-child of a werewolf and the Geico caveman, and a Terrible Secret"") might be even worse than being swept away by the mud and rain. Not quite as hokey as it sounds, thanks to the cast!"
1,keith jarrett will be keith jarrett,"don't get me wrong. i love keith jarrett in his 70s / early 80s solo concerts and all the cool early jazz stuff with charlie haden. i have tons of jarrett albums in cd, vinyl, betamax! but i think for a piece of work that glenn gould and rosalyn tureck spent an entire lifetime to understand and achieve, a work that many have labeled ""transcendental"" when done with tremendous focus, this interpretation is lingering, new age, and a pretender to authenticity by the mere presence of a period instrument....and yes, I play piano."
3,ok for the price,"i had bought these headphones based on a review that compared them to the optimus pro 25 so i allready had high expectations (made by koss). these headphones are ok but no where near as good as the old pro 25's. compared to the old headphones the sound is a little muddy (treble is not as defined and midrange is more prominant), keep in mind a am very picky. not the incredible deal the old headphones were but they are just ok better then the cheapy headphones they would package along with most products. actually if you don't mind about having to increase the treble and the bass to get rid of some of the mid range and give you clearer highs they aren't as bad as I make them out to be (but still not the 25's). they are louder than the 25'si should mention if you ears move with these headphones on you can hear the plastic creak but you could probably just grease where the plastic meets and be done with it."
5,"Great headphones & comfortable, too!",These headphones are very comfortable and the sound quality is amazing but the in-line volume control is icing on the cake!
3,I don't like them,"I purchased these to use with my TV in my bedroom to listen to at night while my wife is trying to sleep. Had to purchase a different pair because my wife could still hear the sound while I was wearing them. I then tried them with my iphone. They work okay but I find them vevy uncomfortalble on my ears. I think it's because the speakers pivot and don't fit flat on your ears. I can't seem to adjust them to fit good. I have a size 7 head which is on the small side and my wife can still hear the music if she is near me. I didn't pay much for them because I purchased them off ebay for about $10.00 I replaced them with a pair of Sennheiser HD 202 I bought off Amazon for about $27.00. What a difference, a litle bit heavier but a lot more confortable better sound quality and when I wear them connected to the TV at night my wife can't hear anything. Would highly recommend the Sennheiser if your using them with a sound system."
5,you get more than what you have paid for,I have been very picky in headphones because I usually listen to music from high-end speakers. This is one of the best headphones that I have ever had. You get more from the money that you put.
4,Awesome value!!,"For 15 bucks you cannot beat these headphones. Great tone and range, no ""tin can"" syndrome. Bass is kind of average relative to headphones of comparable price. Everything else is exceptional."
2,A word of caution,"I really wanted to like these headphones. They're distinctively dorky, cheap(ish), and sound awesome. Unfortunately, they also hurt my ears... a lot! I kept them for two weeks in hopes that I would be able to ""break them in,"" but it's no use. They're going back to Amazon tomorrow."
3,"Good phones for some, but not my cup o' tea!","I had been using a pair of Koss UR5s, which seemed to match my monitors output pretty well, but they had developed a slight buzzing in one side. I thought the Koss KTX Pro1 would be a step up from the extra cheapies, but it really wasn't! The highs were muffled and the bass boost made them practically unusable for my needs (multi-track music production in a DAW environment). So I bought a new pair of UR5s and I'm completely happy with them, because of their much flatter frequency response. If you like a heavy bass boost at about 90hz and a high end rolloff at about 8khz then these would be fine inexpensive phones, but for the same relative quality spend a lot less and get the Koss UR5, or spend more and go with the Koss Pro 4A or some nice Sennhiesers, IMHO."
