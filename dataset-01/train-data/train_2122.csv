5,Great Gift,This a great gift for an adult son that loves football and has followed it for years. Glad someone finally compiled this info.
4,History and Facts,"This book was purchased as a gift for my son-in-law, a Notre Dame graduate. It presents a succinct history of program development, games, players, coaches and statistics for every college. One may think it would read like a telephone book, but it's actually well written and very interesting to peruse, particularly if one's college has a rich football tradition. It's not for everyone, but the college football enthusiast will love it. Giving that book to my son-in-law was akin to feeding the beast."
4,Nice Reference,"I really like the idea behind this book.The one thing I would like to see on the individual team section is their annual team stats. Rushing offense, passing offense, total offense, scoring offense (and the same for defense) and where they stood nationally in each catagory."
1,Inaccurate,"This publication lacks accuracy. As a long time Ohio State fan the section on the Buckeyes incorrectly states: (1)Chic Harley's number 22 was retired; infact, Harley's number was 47; (2) Wes Fesler was not fired as stated in the book but resigned as a result of overwhelming critisism for failing to run out the clock at the end of the first half of the ""snow bowl""; (3)the authors spend a quarter of a page discussing an ESPN article suggesting Ohio paid players without ever stating a two year NCAA investigation found the allegations without merit; and, (4)there is no discussion of the 1935 Ohio State-Notre Dame game considered the ""game of the century.""There are many much better history of college fooball books."
2,so so...,"This book was very interesting. But...simply put, not enough photos. Many of the photos included don't show any tattoos at all. Random elderly people and prisoners, jail cells, signs, etc. If you're wanting to understand the prison culture and politics, it would be wonderful!! If you're looking for an interesting photobook of people's tattoos, this is not the one to pick."
1,Not for the Godly family,"We listened to this CD, particularly the song Fine Finkelstein which in the song talks about how ""normal"" it is for a boy to have 2 mommies. Sorry folks, not in this lifetime. Please do not buy this CD if you want your children to learn Godly principles. There are much better children's CDs from which to choose."
3,Fun Stuff,"I bought these ""tattoos"" for my niece when she was recently pregnant. I don't know if she ever used them but they certainly did make a big hit at the baby shower.ProudBody Tummy Tatts (Temporary Tummy Tattoos)"
3,Season 3 and onward are even better,"I remember watching Barney Miller when it was on the prime time schedule in the late 70's and early 80's, and I remember watching it on reruns in the 90's. This is great and has it's moments, but like many sitcoms, it improves with age. I believe Season 3 will have much more Dietrich, Inspector Ruger, and Officer Levitt, and that's when the show really came into it's own. Jack Soo as Nick Yemana was hilarious and so understated. To tell you the truth, I did not even remember Linda Lavin being on the show, and I liked her show Alice. Thank God for DVD's of old shows to keep us entertained during this vast wasteland state of current television."
5,Funny...,These are always fun! I am glad we could get it on DVD and not rely on Netflix. I like having it in my library.
5,Excellent series,This is an extremely funny series for the first several years. The last season got fairly serious but was all right. I really missed the character of the Puerto Rican cop. I thought he was very good.
5,LOL,"Barney Miller is a classic comedy. The characters are timeless. The humor is not too adult, but also not slapstick. It gets better as you you learn the history of the characters and see them care about each other. I love the way different generations and ethnic backgrounds all inter-relate."
5,At last!,This is fantastic news! I had given up hope the remaining seasons would ever be released. Here's hoping they release the rest on a regular schedule.
2,American Samplers,"I didn't think this reproduction of the original book was described well. I was researching for an article, so I didn't need good copies of the illustrations, which were poor. If I had needed them I would have been disgusted!"
2,Don't buy - fire hazzard,"I've had two of these and initially loved it but one burnt out after about a year, the other caught fire after 2 months! I will not buy another one as I think they are dangerous."
2,Pretty Bad - Sorry!,"This DVD starts strong. Discharge, GBH, and The Exploited all demonstrate why it is that you're watching this (the history of 80's U.K. punk) by turning in some strong performances. Unfortunately, that's about all the video has to recommend itself, and the quality of the music pretty much jumps off a bridge after that. I must admit that I think much less of Toy Dolls, Peter And The Test Tube Babies, and Anti-Nowhere League after watching this - and those are some pretty big names. The lesser-known bands here range from uninteresting to incompetent, with some moments of Benny Hill-inspired punk that are just about unwatchable. I have listened to Crass compilation albums from the 80's, so I know that there was good stuff going on in the U.K. at the time. This DVD not only doesn't capture it, but had me squirming to turn off the TV most of the time."
4,Chinese Cloth and Bamboo Parasol,"I have used the parasol during the hottest summer temperatures this year in Phoenix AZ. Both have protected me from the sun. They are beautiful and everyone carrying a regular umbrella stops, stares and smiles. The red parasol was slightly different from the blue; it did not have a catch to keep the umbrella open, but it remains open without it."
2,"Nice call quality, but maddening user interface","Like other work-at-home users, I want to have my home line in line 1 and work line in line 2. You can't default line 2 to be the primary line, so initiating calls from line 2 can be a hassle because of the awkward key/handset sequence required. Also, using ""hold"" and switching between 1 and 2 simply didn't work -- once line 1 was activated, I couldn't get it to disconnect.It's frustrating -- I've returned two phones recently, have done a lot of research, and there seem to be no obviously superior phones out there. Someone who can make a high voice quality, multi-line phone with a good feature set and a good user interface could print money."
4,Nice Phone,This phone may not be for the business user but it is great for the home owner with two lines. My biggest beef with this system is not having the ability to share the address book with the handsets. You have to manually program each handset with the numbers you call most. If you have a short list it's no problem but try programing 7 handsets and keeping them up to date with a long list. The panasonic for the same or less money at least allows sharing. Otherwise I like the phone.Also one feature that it does do that I never saw published (while researching) is the ability to rename the handsets and base instead of the numbering system. This does make transfering/paging of phones much easier. It works well. You only need to rename the handset and the rest of the phones know it's new name automatically.
2,Only one problem...,"The phone worked great except for the redial function. When trying to redial, the phone will only redial the seven digit number. Not a problem unless you must use the (1)+ area code for your call. There is a menu item to change the outgoing foremat, but it must be done for each individual call. I returned mine after two days."
1,Answering machine not functional,"I bought this phone even after reading all the reviews about the bad answering system. I should have paid attention. I have had this phone for less than six months (but more than the 90 days to return it). The answering system simply doesn't work. It doesn't even play all of my message, much less take any messages. I believe that this model is being phased out, but considering that AT&T has been so unhelpful, I certainly wouldn't buy the newer model. Other things are a bit ""off"" too, but they might be overlooked if the answering system worked."
5,AT&T 2462 Saves drowning poodle!!,"Actually - No. But this phone system has been with us for over a year now, and the quality and features still impress us. Many of our clients don't recognize when they are speakerphone, and the feature-set - for a two-line phone - is impressive. The menu system for speed-dial can be a bit bothersome - but works fine, once you are used to it. One feature we would have liked to see, is a way to add 'hold music'...but this is a minor peeve."
2,Not sufficient for calling card users,"Lack of speed dial is a problem for calling card users. You can enter your pin into the phone book, but you can't use the phone book once a call is initiated."
2,Poor Quality,"It sounded great but after few days of usage, I hate it.1. the number pad buttons on the base are hard to push.2. receiver on the base comes off hook too easily.3. often there are statics and echos while speaking.4. battery on the cordless handset doesn't last very long. A day if I use it total of an hour talk time. 2 or 3 if I don't use it at all.5. speaker functions well most of the time. But it sometimes gives echos to the person on the other end."
4,no complaints,"I can't beleive I actually spent this much money for a phone, but I don't regret it. I just moved into an old house and discovered that only one of the 5 phone jacks actually works. This phone solved that problem. We plugged the corded base into the working phone jack, and put cordless handsets in every other room. Lots of neat features, like playing back messages on speaker through the cordless handsets. My only criticism is that the corded handset feels a little wobbly when you hang it up."
4,A good primer on MFC.,"This book is a good start on basic MFC programming. Recommended if you are just starting out with MFC. Found myself wanting more in depth discussion of some of the MFC concepts such as MDI.The style of writing is (for me, anyway) a bit much. The book is filled with lots of cutesy little jokes, and plays on words that I found really annoying. I prefer strait facts without the warm fuzzy stuff.Having said that, I DO recommend this book as a very useful first volume in your MFC/VC++ reference library."
4,Good book,This book can help to learn MFC and it justifies its pricebut be prepared to learn genealogy just to understand some of theslightly lenghly examples.
1,Written in circles,"This book is very difficult to follow because it is written in circles. They address one topic and a time period and then go on to another topic with a different but overlapping time period. For anyone who thinks linearly, it is very difficult to put events and circumstances together. I was not impressed."
1,hard to read,like i know its history so it wont be much fun to read regardless. however this book was not only hard to read but confusing. i had to google many many things this book would reference but would not explain at all. i had to get it for my class though so i didnt have a choice in that matter but if for some reason you are thinking about this book just for i would highly recommend you find a different book.
4,Helped with CLEP,"I used this book along with the baron's 101 ez keys to pas the American History II CLEP exam. The book was informative, easy to read and not too textbook dry.The softcover format made it easy for me to take with me wherever I went!"
5,Great Experience,"Item as promised in great codition, great price. Item was shipped fast. Thanks for the great service. Very pleased with my experience would buy from again."
4,Great Book,"I was very happy with the book. I was however disappointed with the shipping time. I paid for 2-day delivery, but didn't know that processing the book would take so long. It ended up coming one day before my first test. Luckily I did very well without the book, but next time I will know."
1,jj,i never received the book. I would like to get my money back. I will never purchase anything from Amazon again.Thank youKristie
5,Cinderella,I gave this book five star because the story was a perfect flow from book one. I have to admit that at times I was getting tired with all the pin ups that Charles had about himself but at the end all came in nicely together.
5,Great!,Great book! I couldn't put down the entire series of these books! Too bad she didn't write more on these brothers.
5,Courage under stress,A gripping story of almost breaking under stress and self doubt. Illustrates that family ties and loyalty help one to overcome difficulties in life
4,The wild one was better,"It was a decent read. The trial and tribulations of Charles recovery was so real. Although, for a hero he's very gullible. During his recovery when blind was heart breaking. Amy was there to help but to me she was more a door mat.I gave it a four star because even thou it was well written it was not as good as the wild one. Amy who is the heroine of the story was not fully developed. She was more like a continuous shadow. I will say I was happy to see how Gareth and Juliet fare. Also, Gareth's command to Charles that Charlotte was his daughter not Charles even if Charles is her biological father.If your looking for drama and a bit of sexual tension you found it. Anything beyond that will not be found."
3,Its Okay,Pleasant switch from the Crime Novels I usually read. Be sure to read the series in order so you know how 4 brothers and their stories
4,The Beloved One,"The first two of De Montforte Brothers books that I read I enjoyed very much and now I can say that I enjoyed this one , too. With the devious Lucien manipulating his brothers' lives, I can't wait to read the last book in the series.....The Wicked One."
5,Wonderful Book,I love this book so much I went and bought the rest of the series after reading the first chapter. I would recomend this book to anyone who like romance.
5,Number 2,"Well I have to say this book was just as good as the l last.I cannot wait to read the defiant one,I think Andrews story week be quite enthralling then on to Lucien and his story I only hope nerissa has her own story as well"
4,Wish I knew the family....,I really enjoyed all of these books in the series. I liked her characters and her storylines were original. It made me want to know all the De Monforte Brothers.
3,The Beloved One,I liked the book. It kept me interested but I must admit the story line has been done over and over. I just liked the characters and their chemistry when they come together. I for one am waiting to read the Wicked one. I love the way Lucien gets into everyones business. The series was good. I would recommend it.
1,Angry spoiler alert,"Although I loved the series but chose not to review until after I finished the fourth book I have to say how disappointed I am with only this particular book. I can't understand how anyone could consider a man who could not try to love his first born, who could simply call her a mistake and profess love of yet another child born to another women and be considered the beloved. Beloved my a## . Charles was a wimp, Gareth was more of a beloved who stepped up to the plate and took responsibility for his brother's ""mistake"", being a first born who was set aside as a ""mistake"" I found this book to be a sad testament to how easy it is for men to walk away from responsibility. I only wish I could get my money back for this book. Aside from this book the rest of the series was a good read. Now that I've vent I leave it up to another reader to decide how good this book is because I guess I am too bias about Charlotte."
4,Second in the series.,"I loved Charles. He is a gentleman! Although he and Amy have had their confidence shattered by cruel events, the love that is shown between the two of them is envious. After a long absence, Charles comes home to find that his fiance and his child have become the family of his younger brother. In reality, I think Charles would have been a little more upset at his brother replacing him so easily, but it makes for a lovely story. Once again, there is a cliff hanger that leads to the next book - The Defiant One."
3,"Nice plot, weak writing","I chose to read this book after reading the first in the series. I wanted to see where the story would go with the second brother. It has a nice unique plot. But,as with the first one, in places the narrative went on a bit too long. Plus,some of the characters emotions went a bit overboard. I probably won't read the next one."
1,Beloved One,"I was totally disappointed in this 2nd book in the series. I was not sure it was the same author. The story line is totally different. There are mistakes in the storyline in this book i.e. ""sisters did not post letters but Charles receives responses"". Was looking forward to continuing the family saga but now I am not so sure."
3,"Nice story, good continuation of the De Montforte Brothers....","I liked the plot, but I feel the author kept going of the path a little. I also would have liked to see the main character reunited with his daughter I feel the author did not do the character justice."
2,The Beloved One,"Not a bad book, compared to the first in the series, a real disappointment. Will still read the next one, hoping."
1,TERRIBLE,"I was very disappointed with this book. I had read all the others and I had read them out of order, but this book was terrible. The story was horrible and I forced myself to read it. I'm glad that I read this book last, because if I did read them in order I probably would not have read the other books in the series."
3,"Operations in Arizona Territory, RSV 1967","An interesting read of one man's experience in the Arizona Territory while in the 2/5 Marines. This is one of many books about a Vietnam Vet's war experience. I have read a number of these stories, and I rate it an average read. The northern part of South Vietnam was indeed a dangerous place for a Marine to be. Culbertson paints the Marines as those guys in the white hats, while the Viet Cong and NVPA were the bad guys. His experience in this particular operation is the focus of his book.These vet stories are sometimes enjoyable to read. Since Vietnam was a controversial war, it would have been nice to hear how Culbertson viewed it. The Marines blow up villages, and wonder why the local people view the Marines on the same basis as the VC. This was a nice easy to read war story."
4,Tuscaloosa was good reading,I had read a brief account of this in another Nam book and wanted to know more about it. This author held my interest with his account. Some are too detailed for my taste.
4,new but traditional,"when u come across this music cd you will find it to be recorded in the most traditional way of mexican folk music going back in time to the very roots of traditional regional veracuz folk songs but having a flavor of its own injected by this wonderful group who intenionally keeps it old fashion for those of us who like to revisit old folk songs of further back than yesteryear,it is not for everyone......but it is for those who enjoy traveling in time...........disfrutalo"
5,"I LOVE ""TELL ME"" AND I LOVE BOBBY!!!!!","I am a huge fan and i love Bobby Valentino. He is sexy and hot and has a cute voice. I already bought the album Bobby Valentino and i just got this import. Basically it only has two of his hits, ""Tell me"" which i love (i know how i got my ass in my jeans) and ""Slow Down"" i loved that one too. If you liked those songs, you'd probably like this CD. This isn't the actual album-- just so you know, but it is good for that moment you need a good slow dance, ass shakin' song. Bobby, keep doing your thang. I'm eleven years old and i am in looooooove with this hunk of chocolate. I LOVE YOU AND I'M GOING TO MEET YOU 1DAY !!!!!!Love Krissy Valentino"
3,Not enough power,"Not bad for the price, does a good job but lacks sufficient power. Pressing down on the polisher even very slightly causes the motor to stop. If you need greater power, this is not for you."
3,A Great Collection Of Songs But Not Much Of A Live Set,"As a Swing Out Sister fan I must protest. this is nothing more than a collection of songs instead of a live album. after each song ends there is a gap between songs which shouldn't happen in live albums, should it? (I love the gapless playback in live albums)The playlist on this album is amazing though. Old favorites from the first four SOS album are here and some are even mashed together with the ultra rare Filth and Dreams album, but the inclusion of No Scrubs by TLC was a welcomed surprise (Emphasis on Surprise).Although I am not into giving bad reviews this was a great collection of songs I still find it hard to see it as a live set."
1,A disapointing effort,"Let me state first off that I am very much a SOS fan. That said, I waited anxiously for the disc to arrive, however upon listening, my heart sank as I realized that unlike ""Live at the Jazz cafe"" this disc is a recording of a concert done on the cheap. There is no horn section. This CD is comprised of stripped down tracks knocked out on a synthesizer. If you are expecting the big SOS production, forget it. The music sounds like a night club act covering their songs. Sorry Corinne and Andy, although you are the masters of re-packaging the same material again and again, you need to keep flawed product from reaching the market. If anyone is looking for a good SOS live CD, skip this one (which is even devoid of liner notes, or artwork of any kind, resembling a bootleg), and go with ""Jazz Cafe"" instead."
3,"music is great, but the record publisher is not doing their job","I have no problem with this album. I am a big fan. The live does bring out a different atmosphere which reminds me of the one I attended in San Francisco of 1997. What I dont really appreciate is the publisher's lousy job on the booklet and CD label. As far as people are paying real money for real thing, this is quite a rip off. Cant even afford an art designer or what?"
4,excellent,"Excellent live album from S.O.S. Great new versions from some of their great hits, like surrender (mixed with ""world out of control"") and in general is like to see a picture from a new different point of view. I think that this cd is not a very recently recording because not include any song from their two last workds; ""Somewhere deep in the night"" and ""Where love grows"" and many of the song were originally includes in ""Filth and dreams"" (their most sophysticated work). Great performance with that kind of touch close to jazz."
5,Superb New Live cd,Swing Out Sister on this live cd have re-worked some of their well known and lp cuts into brand new songs!! These new arrangements are fantastic! This is a great example of what a REAL band with REAL singers can do! I always loved the version of 'Stoned Soul Picnic' on the Shapes & Patterns cd but this new live arrangement is something else!(with a piece of Jr.Walkers 'Walk in the night' in the mix). This performance was recorded live in Tokyo and it has a jam session feel to it(much like their other wonderful live cd 'Live at the Jazz Cafe). Corinne never sounded better! SOS fans will not be disappointed with this gem!
5,Buck and Don = Together Again,"I firmly believe that Don Rich was a driving force behind the enormous success of Buck Owens. He was absolutely the best fiddler and picker on that wonderful sounding guitar. I loved his fiddling even though he didn't. I have one of him doing ""Orange Blossom Special"" and he doesn't string those notes together, he picks every single note that's on the sheet music. I know they're pickin' and grinnin' together again. And Buck has finally found peace, for after Don's death, you could see the will to go on had gone out of Buck."
2,Little known songs and lots of text.,"Most of these instrumentals will not be recognized by most listeners. I feel that a Gospel instrumental needs to be well known to the point that it brings back memories of singing it in church and even the memory of many of the words. There are some of those in this collection, but too many of those got jazzed up or bluesed up a bit too much in my opinion. Mr. Baker is a very talented player and arranger. I like his arrangement of ""What a Friend We Have in Jesus"", very Chet Atkins like, and am learning it. I got my money's worth if I learn 2 or 3 tunes so I'm not overly disappointed. Much of the book is text about the history of Gospel music, not music itself. If you want to be challanged with intricate fingerstyle arrangements and really don't care if others recognize the tunes then this book my be for you."
3,"Good, but has some errors.","I think it is a good book for reference. However, you can't understand the details of the covered chapters which might be required to pass the exams. The questions in the books should have explanations so that the reader will know why the answers are chosen."
5,Great read for focusing on passing the tests,"This is the best written book for logically laying out the data required to pass the tests. If you read this book, you will pass all the tests on your first try.Great work!!!"
4,book review,This was a textbook that was used for a mission's class. It came as promised. This book is written on the 1970's but is still has information that was helpful for the class.
2,disappointing,"Bourdain has written better - much better. This was slow. The story was unconvincing. The 'hero,' Henry, was shallow and fake, as was the gangster he was supposedly trying to comes to terms with (having been hired once to kill him...) Compared with 'Bone in the Throat,' this was very poor fare indeed. One expects more, because his earlier books were riviting and entertaining. Like His T.V. Travel series, clearly the man has gottern jaded and tired and his delivery now lacks sparkle and verve. He wrote this in the same tired voice he uses when doing one of his exotic dining scenes in far-off place, 'yet another snake consumed (yawn, yawn) Had he writtem 'Bamboo the same way he wrote Kitchen Confidential, it would have been a best seller. Instead it was a disappointment."
4,not as good as his first but still interesting,"This isn't quite as good as Bone in the Throat but is still pretty engrossing. The plot isn't much, and the ending is disappointing, but still Bourdain turns a good phrase and I couldn't put the book down. The characters are likeable, and you care about what happens to them, although there is something uncomfortable about liking characters who are ruthless killers. Some of the story line could have been developed further, but still this is a pretty good read."
2,Sophomore Slump,"A rather disappointing followup to ""Bone in the Throat,"" this mob caper never reaches the breezy good humor of the Bourdain's debut. There are some decently interesting characters (a crossdressing mobster and a legendary ancient French commando being two), and some offbeat happenings, but the climax is wholly unsatisfying (at least to me). One redeeming aspect is that Bourdain doesn't shy away from killing some of the characters you least suspect will die. Definitely read ""Bone in the Throat,"" before this, as some of characters overlap, and this comes second chronologically."
4,"Excellent Cuts, Authentic Sound",This entire boxed compilation is an excellent source of introduction to the Jamaican sounds and their style of recording. I have an extensive collection of jamaican cd's and these are an excellent beginning for any budding enthusist
1,is that your magic wand or are you just happy to see me...,"I quit this book 20 pages in. This ""romance"" starts with a woman going to the forest for an extramarital tryst. Well, before the human gets there she is ""spellbound"" and,IMO, semi-forced into sex with a male fairy(using his ""sensual powers""-LOL). The authors goes into quite a bit of detail about the ""ravishment"" and size of the fairy's, ""magic wand"", if you know what I mean? Like-""He was so big I couldn't even move""-ICK!!!! Was written more like soft core porn than romance. Cliche and laughably bad.Tossed this one into the UBS pile-too many better fantasy romance books than to waste time on this one. Half a star for a pretty cover."
4,An orginal twist on Romance-fantasy stories,What can the fairies do to ensure the survival of their dying race? Seduce human females and hope for the best.Raena (the daughter of the fairy prince and a human mother) and Valor (the knight she captivates and weds) come alive in this wonderful story. I'm looking forward to read about their half-brother Avery when he falls headlong into love!
5,Exceptionally Brilliant - and long overdue.,"This book is a genuine delight to read. It was written in simple language and is so very entertaining and informative. I can relate to so many of the issues and have really learned how I should be trying to resolve some of them. This book will help me to help others in my family deal with similar situations concerning my ADHD child.I know this book is written especially for ""DADS""; however, this ""MOM"" has also learned ALOT! Bravo for a job well done."
3,"Cute, but not much meat",This ia cute book but seems aimed more at children than at fathers. I am not sure what the target demographic may be but I did not find it particularly useful either in understanding or adapting to the issues I face in having taken in a nephew with this condition.
5,great buy!!!,"havent played with a yoyo in 10 years bought as something to putz around with....cant put it down now!!!!! was shooting the moon, walking the dog and rocking the baby in no time, love the product"
4,Very nice Yo-yo,"This one is very good because of its shape. It let you make some tricks reserved to butterfly yo-yos and is comfortable enough. The bearing let you spin for a reasonable time. Be aware of replacing string each time you reach approximately seventy two hours of continue use (that's a lot of time), if not, it won't respond."
4,noise effect,great alert product but unfortunately my yorkie gets a fit of shaking when it goes off...i dont know why he does that...
5,Excellent analysis of human factors in aviation,"This is a well-researched book on how human factors affect aviation workers. It's not restricted to pilots. Maintenance workers, management, politicians, manufacturers are all affected by the psychological factors detailed in the book. Many of the concepts occur in everyday life to everyone. There were several times when the author talks about concepts like laterality which happened to me personally, even if I've never been involved in aviation work.Highly recommended."
3,"Acer AL1916AB 19"" LCD Monitor",This monitor is fine as long as it is set to the highest resolution possible (1280 X 1024). Lower resolutions cause 'jaggies' and there is no anti-aliasing. This model was manufactured in January of 2006. I understand that models manufactured after this date received an upgrade that included anti-aliasing.
1,No Global Support Sucks,"I bought this monitor and delivered it to Brazil. After 2 days of work it just don't turn on anymore. I could live with that. The funny thing is that, although Acer has a representation in Brazil, and sell LCD's locally, it does not provide any guarantee for products bought abroad. Thus, beware!I'd rather buy LG or Samsung in the future, if you want to take your LCD abroad."
5,"A Beautiful, Versatile Monitor!","After having used CRTs roughly the size of small cars for my entire life, I finally jumped on the LCD-flatscreen bandwagon. This Acer 19"" LCD makes me happy I did!Mostly using my computer for gaming and movies the color, brightness, and size of the screen really matters to me. This monitor really nails all three of those areas. It provides vivid, crisp colors; it doesn't wash out the picture with super-brightness (what my old monitor did), nor is its display too dark to catch the action; and the 19"" screen seems to have the perfect balance of immense screen size yet incredibly low desk size."
5,Hubbie loves his new monitor,"We've made do for a long time with a smaller old-fashioned monitor, but it really was night & day between home and my husband's work, where he uses two 21' LCD monitors. ;-) I thought this would make a nice present for his birthday, and he loves it - it fits well, looks great, and the color seems very realistic."
5,"Fantastic monitor, huge improvement over a tube","I have a desk that has a platform for the monitor above the desktop. That's great, but my old 17"" CRT was way too big for it. I had to pull my desk away from the wall about 6 inches just to get the monitor on the platform without it tipping forward onto the desktop.So, last Christmas I decided to treat myself. With my Christmas bonus I bought this Acer LCD. I've had it for a year now, and have never been happier with a piece of computer equipment. The colors are sharp and bright, the lines are well defined, and it was so easy to set up! It was easy enough that when my husband got the widescreen version of this monitor, he was able to set it up with absolutely no help from me, and that's saying something!"
5,Xbox 360 Monster GameLink Component Video A/V Cable,"Amazing Cable. Supports 1080p. Makes games look so much better. Battlefield: Bad company 2 looks absolutely amazing. The sound quality is great and the cable is long, but not to long to be messy, and its very durable. The outside of the cable feels like a wire mesh sort of thing. All in all this cable is great. For 17 dollars you cant go wrong with a Monster cable. Ever."
3,Fair price on a fair product,"I ordered this as a replacement for the original. Although the AV quality is great, I broke the attachments off of my television trying to unplug this cord. The terminals are way too tight, otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars."
2,Eh.......Get the Microsoft One.,"THIS REVIEW IS A MUST READ! This cable is actually pretty amazing and mind-blowing for some games, but it has many graphical errors for other games. EG; Games like the Call of Duty Series, Kinect series, and the Halo series, this cable is the best you can buy. But for games made/licensed by EA (Includes BF3), Sega, Atari, or any company that isn't Bungie or Activision, the graphics get screwed up, and compared to Gamecube with a standard AV cable, the graphics look WAAYYY better on Gamecube. The reason its 2 stars and not 3 stars is because it costs more than the regular component cable, so you should get more for what you pay for. This is my review and doesn't work as well as you want it to. Get the Microsoft one or the Madcatz one."
3,I am a little disapointed,I got this cable to connect the xbox to the surround sound but I looked and it doesnt have a spot for the fiber optic cable so now I have to buy another cable that has a fiber optic plug. I guess my son can use the cable for when we move it to his room. I will have to figure something else out.
1,This Design is Retarded!,"The guy from the Netherlands is 100% correct. This is an idiotic design. There's no way that the cable will reach both the tv and a separate tuner; which is at least half the reason for buying it. It's supposed to be video AND audio, duh! Maybe if I stand my tuner on its end behind the tv, it'll reach...Mine's getting returned immediately."
1,Useless,"What was Monster Cable thinking when they designed this thing? You would presume that a company with a high end audio back ground like Monster understood that their customers most likely would want to connect the stereo output to a separate amplifier and not to the input of a television set. (If you'd want to do that yu would not spend that kind of money on an interconnect.) However, the end of the cable is much to short to connect to any other device but the t.v. As I said, useless."
5,Great option for Microsoft brand,The HDTV cable that comes with the Xbox 360 has a bad connection in the optical audio connector. The Monsater brand did not have this problem and the audio quality is great - no more static. The video quality is to be expected from Monster - A++.A must buy and trash the OEM cable...
1,Damaged T.V,Not only were these wires hard to fit into my 32inch Panasonic T.V they were even harder to pull out. When I tried to twist and pull off the monster cable the cable itself broke and even damaged my new hd television port. The cables were made very poorly though Iam sure they work well based on other reviews. This was the biggest waste of money ever.
1,xbox 360 monster cable,The monster cables for the Xbox 360 works better than all the other store bought cables I have bought. It was worth the price.
3,Gives my Xbox360 1080i reception,"Got this so that my Xbox 360 could play two players - split screen - in Minecraft. I didn't realize that the cable that came with the Xbox was only SD - should have figured that out when I hooked it up, huh?Anyway, this Monster Cable works well and did improve the picture quality from 480p to 1080i. Good solid cable. Wouldn't usually buy Monster - but this one was the cheapest available at the time, and with free two-day shipping with Prime, a good deal.Only got three stars as I paid for Prime 2 day delivery and it came 4 days later - slow for Prime."
1,This is NOT memory foam.,"I had high hopes for this backrest b/c it was described as ""Memory Foam."" I sleep on memory foam, I have memory foam pillows, memory foam is my friend. This backrest is no memory foam!It is a firm, non-pliant foam, that does not conform or mold in response to the body's heat or pressure -- I even tried placing a very warm pan on it and it didn't mold at all. It does, however, smell moldy! Not kidding."
1,Bad back rest. Using as a car seat cushion,I purchased 2 products; one back rest and one seat cushion. I am happy with the seat cushion. The back rest was increasing my back pain and now I use it as a seat cushion in my car. It is not bad for that. I did not return it to save the shipping expenses and environment.I think the shape of the backrest is the problem.
3,"Not great, Not terrible","I've given up on the two straps that snap together in the back. It was impossible to get them to stay in place. One was always too tight and the other too loose. I spent the first couple of days with it constantly adjusting, much to mine and my co-worker's chagrin. So, now I only use one of the straps and manually adjust as needed. Not great, but it does offer some relief."
2,Poor Fit,"Sorry i had to review this... I got this 5 years ago and i've been using it to work ever since. The first thing i noticed was the straps were to short to snap at the back of the chair so because of it, it does not rest well and ends up sitting on the side. I have to constantly move it in the middle because the way the straps were made makes the backrest move to the side. This will only work for small chairs not the one's you see at work. I have yet to find a good one but for now i'll just add a pillow"
3,not what I expected,"This cushion does help my back in a computer/desk chair by allowing me to sit on tyhe entire chair, rather than having to scoot up, but it's too hard. Not sure I would recommend this, might look for something softer."
5,a comfortable one,"it hold up my back on the right place. Feel comfortable when reading.Although I bought a refurbished one, the quality is also good, and cheap."
4,Very helpful for uncomfortable office chairs,"I sit at a computer all day and our new office has terrible office chairs. I got this and it helped a lot, provides extra back support and you can adjust it pretty easily to get it in the right position. It took a few days to get it fully adjusted how I like it, but I've been using it now for 2-3 months and really enjoy this. Definitely recommended."
1,product would have gotten 4 stars except for odor,"I would have returned it if I wasn't so lazy - It had a very strange odor, almost moldy. It took 3 days of being outside and a bottle of Febreeze to have it smell ok - and I still get a slight odor from it."
4,Graphics stuck out well in cut-out bin....,"...so I gave it a shot considering that most of the groups involved ""In The Fishtank ""(Tortoise, The Ex, Sonic Youth, etc.) are interesting in nature. This effort (from a 1997 session) is actually very solid, wandering from indie pop (""You Lie"") to experimental work-outs (""Jungle Bells"") that is not only tolerable but rather something you'll actually play more than once. They even cover Joni Mitchell's signature song ""Help Me"".Note: ""Jungle Bells"" sounds strangely like a mutated version of ""Jingle Bells"" during the keyboard riffs.Yes, I know nobody cares."
5,Best Jazz Cd I ever bought,U-nam Music style is amazing. Excellent from beginning to end!! Great job U-nam!!!!!You got a fan on me.
4,good craftsmanship,I was suprised when I rec'd my bag. It seems to be of good quality and durable . I was hoping it would have been a little thicker but ill make it work!
2,defective,"I love the episodes BUT...so far disc one's picture is messed up. It looks like other people are having the same problem... and so I'm not sure if going through the arduous process of exchanging it will be of any help. Is everyone having these problems? It is too bad they are selling a defective dvd of a really good show.again, it would be 5 stars if the dvds weren't messed up. Sometimes I miss VHS."
3,A classic Nick show,"I just got my copy in the mail and love it. The only problem i have with the DVD is the cheapness of the menus. They could use a little more animation, or, at the very least, have some music playing in the background on a loop like most DVDs do. The picture quality is a little poor, but it's nice to just have this show on DVD. And in a spiffy looking box.I would've liekd to have seen some old Nick-Nick-Nick spots in the special features, or an inside-out boy short, but beggars can't be choosers. Highly reccommended for anyone who loves old-schol Nick programming.And yes, i have the same problem on my DVD of hearing people saying stuff in the background on the space and geeks special."
2,Not my favorite Nick show,"I am one of many who's been raving about how the 90s was the golden age of children's television, but this show just didn't make the cut for me. It struck me as far too melodramatic, I didn't like how several of the adults were infantile in nature, and I couldn't believe that parents would give their two sons the same name. I won't fault anyone for liking it, but this was one show that saw me playing outside."
5,Better than Season 1!!!,"I bought this dvd for Christmas and I'm so happy that I got it. It has more episodes than season 1 (4 more episodes).When I started watching the dvd I was suprised that I had forgotten a lot of these episodes, especially ""On Golden Pete.""This dvd has all 13 episodes of the season and 1 Pete & Pete speical. It also has 5 shorts ""Artie, the Strongest Man... in the World"" ""The Launch"" ""The Punishment"" ""Route 34"" ""X-Ray Man""If ya loved season 1 then you're really gonnan love season 2."
5,TV Shows Don't Get Better Than This!!!,"""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"" is a TV phenomenon. It was one of the many reasons that Nickelodeon gave, to watch TV. This show, in partnership with other classic Nick shows changed the face of TV for the better. It is unfortunate to see TV going downhill as fast as it is. That is why we have these wonderful memories to look back on, to remember TV as it once was. I give a full five stars for this show! It is a top 10 list entry all the way!!!I fully agree with the review above that listed the Nick shows that need to be released! It IS a gold mine for DVD collectors. Sign whatever petitions you need to, to get these wonderful shows released! From one DVD collector to another, happy DVD shopping!"
4,"A classic anime, with a wonderful plot.","After having seen nearly 100 anime films in the last 5 years, I would have to say that Miyu is one of the best still. It's a tough choice between this film and Battle Angel for having the best female heroine. A must see on the list of classics."
4,Vampire Princess Miyu,"Ok, I can't think of a review title. Anyways, I really liked the Vampire Princess series. I thought this tape was pretty good with good animation. I pretty much watched it over and over again.In this tape I found that the story was quite confusing at first, but overall it was good. The story got better later on. Now what I want to see next is the TV series of Vampire princess Miyu ^_^."
1,wrong part!!!!!!!!!!!,i ordered the axle carriers for my revo 3.3 and i got sent the axle carriers for E MAX. i had to buy a different bearing for them to fit. i will buy REM parts from now on. REM is more durable and last time i checked offered a lifetime warranty. might wanna check those out before you order the wrong part!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,minimal information (possibly good for technophobes),"This is a small book, about the size of one of the super thin CD cases. It tells you about one cool thing to do per two page spread. It has about 50 pages. Do you get the idea?It is well suited for someone who wants to go just a tiny bit beyond what the ipod packaging itself tells you. Many of the things it tells you are simply how to turn on or off various options. This is a good book for someone who doesn't want to get involved in doing very much with their ipod, but just wants to know a bit more than what apple tells you.If you're getting an ipod as a gift for a person who is not experienced with technology, it would be a good choice. However, if you're the type who is using amazon to find an ipod book, you would probably find this book unsatisfying."
2,Pretty terrible,"I've worked through a number of language tapes, both for German and other languages, and Breakthrough German is one of the worst I've ever encountered.For starters, the primary narrator of the tape struck me as arrogant and condescending. But worse than that is that the program does little to aid retention of what's presented. There are few opportunites to repeat what you've just heard and no follow-ups to confirm that you've said the new term correctly.Also, the program appears to have been produced in the UK so some of the translations are a bit funky (for example ""tschus"" is translated as ""cheerio"")On the positive side, some of the dialogues on the tape appear to be genuine, real-life conversations that have been (surreptitiously?) recorded.As alternatives, I'd check out Pimsleur (very expensive but excellent) or Living Language."
5,A great album,"I've really been enjoying this album, listened to it many times now. Really I can describe it as ear candy.His version of ""Find Your Way Back"" on this album is really great, probably my favourite track of all."
4,Excellent music,"I enjoy the album's first track, ""Native Tongue"", and the instrumental version of ""Find Your Way Back"". Good to see him pay homage to an old Starship favorite."
1,Chrome robot music,"I think beautiful chromed robots would make love to this album.This album is labelled 'New Age' because of the light synthesizer sound, that there are no lyrics and that some of the songs drift off into spacey tangents. I respect Craig's guitar work, he's an excellent technician. I just find the songwriting to be uninspired. This album feels antiseptic to me, it's not earthy and textured, it's spacey and smooth. If you like light jazz and new age, then this is for you. If you like acoustic guitar with humanizing imperfections then I recommend looking elsewhere."
5,LOVE THIS ALBUM!,"""[Cymbals At Dawn] is one of those CD's I put in my CD player as soon as possible and haven't taken out yet!"""
3,Not really worth the money,"Country music,good or bad, leaves me cold - the standout performances in this gawdawful compilation are Buddy Ebsen warbling through classic Hank Williams (Your Cheating Heart) and Lorne Greene's alien-sounding ""French"" version of Ringo. I am French myself, and I can tell you he speaks it with a truly unusual accent. The Wink Martindale number is a specially nauseating brand of treacle that should be avoided at all costs.I special-ordered the item to have all three Golden Throats compilations, but would not do so again..."
4,Solid Death Metal/Melodic Death Metal Album,"These guys opened up for Six Feet Under, which I saw at Harpo's in Detroit, on 6/15/12. I was very impressed with the live performance, so I bought 2 copies of the album (one for me, and one for my friend, who also enjoyed them!) A few tracks actually stand out: #'s 7 and 12, I believe (I never know names of songs... just track numbers.)Anyway, this isn't your standard blast-beat death metal. Cryptic Warning will take brief excursions into a more jazzy realm once in a while, which adds a nice progressive twist and keeps things interesting. There's a lot of talent here, and I'd like to see where these guys go!"
3,Lymphatic Drainage Review,"The quality of the video is very good and the graphics too, however many important techniques of the lymphatic drainage, specifically the related to chest and legs are not shown."
1,Phantom product,"Waited almost one month for the product to be shipped, without success. Supplier advised that the product was back ordered so finally cancelled the order."
2,Meh....,"I guess i'm allergic to it O.o It burns after a few seconds of contact to internal membranes.It is a nice thick consistency, so it's a shame I can't use it.Though it has an order that I dislike. Reminds me of pine tree sap, actually.I'll give KY a shot before I buy this stuff again."
2,A Failed Fear Factory Clone Attempt,"I know, I know. We are all looking for a band that sounds something like Fear Factory, because Fear Factory are the pioneers of Godly Cyber Metal. Let me put your mind to rest. Fear Factory this is not. Including one of the many ex-guitarists from Cradle of Filth, this band sounds nothing like them. The vocals are horrible. The singer tries to mesmerizingly dark while at the same time possessing that spark of awe that Burton C. Bell has. In closing, let me say this: Stick with Fear Factory."
5,"A ""MUST"" read for everyone!","Mr. Bowsher has put it all in one book. All of the qick fixes that will not get the job done, as well as the master plan with a step by step road map to fax all schools. (K-12) This book has unlimited references to all the ideas that are working as well as the well-intentioned political fluff that so many people are trying to do. Jack points out that money is not the problem, we just have to spend it on major reform, not band-aid fixes. This book is a ""MUST"" read for government officials, educators, teachers, parents, and anyone interested in fixing our educational system."
4,Long Time Ago,"Thats me playing guitar on the Ronstadt cuts. I was part of her band Swampwater. It was friggin freezing out when we recorded that performance at night, right off the Pacific Ocean. As a result we were all out of tune...but all in all a great performance by Linda and everyone else. And to the guy above who says we sounded like we were ""out of Nashville"", Ill have him know that we were fresh from Hollywood Cal. Shows what an expert HE is.I was right by the side of the Beach Boys when they played. They had extra musicians backstage playing with them. Still, they were very good.It was a fun concert to be in. We had even more fun back at the hotel. Ahhh, fun times. This CD is a good snapshot of the day.John Belandwww.johnbeland.com"
2,This Is A Disappointment,"Smooth Grooves usually stay's straight lace, but this one is straight bunk. Mtume, Phylis Hyman, and Bobby Womack are the only ones to my liking. Now those songs are top notch but the rest fall short. They ain't classic. They ain't smooth. And they Ain't groovin. This one is weak ya'll."
3,Decent Collection although there's more misses than hits,"The Smooth Grooves series is an exceptional collection of neglected soul and urban R&B singles. Concentrating on the early '80s and late '70s, the selections of the series are lush and seductive, drawing from Philly soul and disco in equal measures. Smooth Grooves, Vol. 6 features selections by Debra Laws, Bunny Sigler, and a duet with Phyllis Hyman and Michael Henderson with only a few strong selections. The strongest songs are Can't We Fall In Love,It's Different , and You,Me & He."
2,"poorly written, poorly edited","I expected to learn something by reading this book, but unfortunately it's very poorly written and edited--I think both author and publisher are at fault here. Worse, I felt no sympathy at all for this woman by the end of the book--and I'm a feminist! This is not the memoirs of a sane or rational person. She is certainly largely to blame for her troubles, in fact I think she's as mentally unstable as her husband. I bought this book merely for one's woman's perspective on what it must be like to live in Iran, but the book failed to deliver even that. The author lacks any insight into her own mental state and her descriptions of daily life are vague and confused."
2,"Great book for book club discussion, not great literature.","Our women's book club overall found the book to be too ""chatty"" and very difficult to follow, especially when discussing her myriad family and friends. What was interesting, however, is that this book engendered a very lively discussion on Iran, the role of women, and Western bias in understanding different cultures. Daughter of Persia was mentioned as a better book to read. In all, we felt this was not a great book, but was a good discussion book for a book club."
1,Tedious & awful,"Somehow I did make it through this book, but it was only out of sheer force of will. It was poorly written and dull. I thoroughly enjoy books on Iran in particular and the Middle East in general, but this book was more of an exhausting sob story than it was an interesting autobiographical journey. There's only so many pages that a person can endure a laundry list of complaints. If you're looking for a journey into today's Iran, read ""Searching for Hassan"" or ""Honeymoon in Purdah."""
3,Don't sound like no nightmare for at least half the book,"The beginning of the book is boring. Too much tedious narrative about her big rich family and her love of designer clothes. It doesn't sound like she's living some ""nightmare"" in Iran in the least. She's a second-rate writer too, using hack-y terms like ""poetic soul."" Uggh! It starts to sound like a nightmare and get interesting when she grows scared of getting old and marries that jerk"
1,The worst book I've ever read.,"poorly written, poorly edited, ONFUSING and UNTIDY, wondring how find this book a way in to amazon listing.The worst book I've ever read."
4,It's amazing what these poor women put up with!,Mosteshar touched me with her book and opened a new door showing me the life of Iranian women.
2,Unveiled,"The first half of this book is totally frustrating. There are too many characters and the family tree is virtually useless. The second half is exasperating. Here is a woman of so called nobility and educated who, in rebellion against her upbringing, marries an inferior, rude, sexist, demanding, and controlling gigolo. The reader can only tire of her rationalizing a destructive marriage, conceived and executed with her consent. The only kind thing I can say for Cherry is that perhaps her rebellion against her parents, who ruled and dominated her early dating life, responded in the only way she knew how. Choose someone totally and completely the opposite of anyone they would have chosen for her. Well done....but why punish yourself?"
1,Hide this book under the veil,"After 20 pages, I was bored. I forced myself to read 85 pages, and it did not get better. There are too many family members involved in the sub-plots which only confuses the reader, rather than enhancing the story of the main character. I confess, I never finished the book. Maybe it gets better.... ?"
2,Irresponsible book that only increases cultural stereotypes,"I'm about 3/4 of the way through the book, and am finding it to be the tale of a confused, bicultural woman returning to an even more confused, multi-cultural country. It's a rather trashy and not partiularly well-written account of her experiences. While probably all true, it makes me sad to think that this, and its companion book with the theme of ""horrible time in Iran,"" Not Without My Daughter, may be one of the few views into Iranian culture for Western readers. I'm not sure what the author's motivation was (revenge? to raise funds?), but I'm finding it to be an irresponsible book that only increases cultural stereotypes. Imagine not knowing a thing about America's South other than its racism."
1,"IM GLAD I BORROWED, AND NOT BOUGHT THE BOOK!!","I agree, this book was totally ""CONFUSING"" and ""UNTIDY"". I felt the writer was totally self centered,with her constant chatter about her wealth and designer clothing, was it really necessary to keep mentioning such irrelevent matters? One other thing, her sense of humor just did not suit her. Maybe her next book will be a little more humble."
1,What a mess.,"It was only through sheer force of will -- and lack of any other books at hand -- that got me through this mess of a story. Cherry ranmbles through most of it and is almost incoherant when she dwelves endlessly into tales of various friends and family members that have little to no bearing on the story that she's promised to tell, that of her marriage. We don't even get to that story unti the last third of the book, and when we do, it's eye-rollingly silly. She married this man KNOWING he was bad news and STAYED with him after she realized that he was married to another woman and wasn't interested in the sort of relationship that she was.I didn't think this book had much to do with Iran; it was just another story about an unhappy marriage. It's difficult to related to Cherry and impossible to sympathize with her ""plight."""
5,Magnifique!,Lucie Blue TremblayThis French-Canadian chanteuse combines her intelligent compositions and lyrics with a soothing voice that makes listening a pleasure.
3,VERY NICE....,My 2yr old son loves these sneakers. I have a hard time getting him to put on anyhing else. I think the lights were the clincher.
2,Keeper of my Heart,This cd was not what I expected. Before I ordered this cd I was not able to listen to any of the songs.
5,Fascinating!,"I found the story absorbing. I liked the twists. The only criticism I could make is that I thought that they should have some of their facts examined a bit better. A sharpshooter's rifle is set for a person. The odds are that a rifle for Zikri would be set differently to Claybon.I liked the way that they brought the evidence in and I even liked the way at the end they left some doubt about whom did it. Life is not black-and-white and it is nice the writers left us with that view.Many of the actors are barely known but they all played well. I though in particular the woman who played Zikri's wife was extremely good. Many acted almost exactly as similar characters do in life.The filming is good. While watching the movie a second time, I kept stopping and playing it back trying to figure out how they did some of it. They wove real life and fiction well.By the way, I have little doubt that the conclusion after such an event some tough security laws would be introduced is true."
2,Disappointing,"I never understood the reason behind making this film. I thought it might be something like ""Look what would happen if Bush was assassinated."" However, other than one little dig at ""President"" Cheney trying to have his cabinet fit the facts of the crime to a conveniently accused Arab American (just like Iraq and the WMD), it barely touched the subject. The movie left me feeling - nothing. Not recommended."
5,Death of a President,"This was a good afternoon's entertainment for $3 or so and I didn't have to run back to RedBox to return it. I find it preferable to buy good cheap movies (keyword - ""Cheap"") which are abundantly available on Amazon than to rent $1 movies and be obligated to return them when it frequently isn't convenient. Also, I can then sell them later and not only get my money back but can even make a little profit. The other advantage is that there are a lot of great less than current movies out there that you won't find at rental sites. I'm very happy with this purchase."
2,far left film also pretty boring,"this was not too exciting , u can tell the anti war pro Muslim message to it"
3,Political Thriller as Cinema Vérité,"The fictional ""Death of a President"" (2006) has more plausibility and resonance a year after its initial release. Despite the occasional heavy-handedness of his fauxumentary approach, director/co-writer Gabriel Range reveals some provocative truths about America and its reaction to a hypothetical assassination. Now that the controversy and critical brickbats have died down, this flawed but fascinating film can be seen in a more objective light."
1,Agatha Christie he isn't.,"I would definitely not recommend this book. The writing is juvenile in manner and does not make for an interesting read. Mr Alpert should take the time to develop his characters. They seemed like caricatures of people he met at a boring cocktail party. I couldn't care less what happened to any of them as they were all dislikable. They storyline had numerous contradictions and the dialogue choppy and disjointed. For example, "" Inside he discovered several francs totaling a great deal of money"". I would hardly call several francs a fortune! The book jacket says that the author hopes to write 100 books before he turns 100. My guess is that there is a better chance of 100 monkeys with a 100 typewriters spinning a better tale."
4,Almost As Good As Moonwater and Snow Goddess,"Moonwater and Snow Goddess are hard to beat, by anyone. Pure sonic poetry. Journey to Zipangu is very good, just not as good as his previous two albums. I would say if you like Himekami, get it anyway. Also, check out Mai Eri Sugai. Real top shelf Asian style music."
3,"Thank goodness! A good, new writer is here!","This was one of the most satisfying escapist novels I've read in a long time. It got me through one day of a long road trip. Thank you, Mr. Rollins, and please keep writing."
2,Don't even bother,"It was a good attempt for a first time publishing author. I'm holding more hope for his subsequent books, however. This one was a flop: it starts out interesting with a thickening plot, but it loses steam and becomes exponentially ridiculous and cheesy. Some of the dialogue from Ashley to her son Jason made me want to gag. All of that ""hun"" talk is quite antiquated and unnecessary. I made it 3/4 through the novel and had to call it quits when I realized it wasn't worth my time. A good attempt, sir, but the next must be better than this or you're off my list."
3,Worth a read,"Sure, it's the hoary and oft-employed ""The Land that Time Forgot"" theme of protagonists fighting off critters and tribes that don't belong in this century and have somehow escaped discovery. But, it can be brought off with innovative twists and I believe Rollins accomplishes that.I'm less sanguine about the cliché composition of the team: gritty woman, hardcore military type, free spirit, avaricious antagonist and cute kid (see ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Aliens,"" et al). Even Gilligan came up with a movie star, eccentric snob, farm girl, etc. when he was stranded. Can we get some real people who aren't just too cool, so we can relate?That's about my only quibble. I acknowledge there are several errors of fact, but this came out early in the author's career and hopefully he can afford a research staff now to ferret those out.The plot moves along and suspense is created in adequate portions. So, if you like your pulse picked up a little, I'd give it a read."
2,Disappointing,"I was extrememly disappointed in this one. After reading reviews and the teaser on the back cover, I ran home expecting an original storyline. I was sorely mistaken. Everything about this book is totally cliche. The only comparison this book has to Jurassic Park or the Lost World is the fact that it has dinosaurs and an unrealistically invincible little kid as one of the main characters. The plot twists are entirely too predictable and more often than not way too convenient. Maybe I'm being too critical. I appear to be the first not to like this book, but if your looking for something more than what amounts to a predictable and routine B-movie in a book, my advice is to look elsewhere."
1,Ridiculous. Stopped reading it after the explosives were strapped to the kid.,"Sorry but it was just too far-fetched for me! There's a word in French: invraisemblable. It means not believable. Plus the dialogue was so predictable, it was boring."
1,Truly awful!,"Terrible! Sounded good from the synopsis - a hidden world beneath the polar ice caps, and a team put together to go explore when another team goes missing - but the characters were so wooden and annoying that I fervently hoped all of them would die, violently, at the hands (well, teeth) of the T-Rex type creatures who live in the underground world. You had the stereotypical tough-gal single mom who brings her brat with her, the oh-so-hunky military guy she eventually beds, and the evil Arabic archetype who wants to blow everything up. I can't even bother to give more detail than that; it's not worth it. I'm surprised I even finished it."
1,poor character development & research,"Pretty good plot but the character development is terrible and research is worse. Main character Ashley is a whiner you quickly grow to detest. Ben is a nerd. Poor research. Khalid is from Egypt, a country whose ""lifeblood is oil"". Egypt has very little oil production. Another scene has a character who tapes a bunch of bullets together and shoots them to cause a explosion. An impossible feat. Author has two SEALs he ranks as majors. No such rank in the navy, would be Lt. Commanders. Two Marine brothers calling each other ""soldier"". Marines call themselves ""marine"", never soldier. This just goes on and on. Started to give the book two stars because plot is decent but, on reflection, decided one star was ample reward for what is clearly a lazy writer."
4,Good read!,Very orginal and interesting. Lots of imagination. I could see it all like it was a movie unfolding in my head. Real page turner. I seldom give out 5 stars that is why this only got 4.
3,Another good movie-script-in-book-form thriller,"I was hoping for a real Hollow Earth story, but even though this just takes place in some enormous tunnels and caverns, it's a good underground thriller. The gimmick is a nice one and quite entertaining. The writing is fairly crisp, but like many modern thrillers it's really a movie script in book form, fleshed out with a little extra description. Still, it's a fine read for a long bus trip or while relaxing at the beach.Don't forget Verne's Journey to the Centre of the Earth or Rucker's The Hollow Earth if you like this sort of thing."
4,Excellent thriller!,"This first-time novel from Rollins is a thrilling and exburent ride into the unknown and unchartered underworld. Though at first-glance the characters seem a bit two-dimensional, they come alive as danger mounts at every turn. A page-turner similiar to Koontz and Saul! Highly recommened!"
5,Deep Terror,"Jules Verne started the story, but James Rollins has refined it. A great read for those who dare not leave the comforts of their easy chair to venture underground. Not since Steward's ""Tales of Dirt, Danger, and Darkness,"" has a book so described the horrors that may lurk in the dark hidden underground worlds. A must read!"
4,"Overall a fun, suspenseful novel","I really did enjoy Rollins' novel, and would recommend it. Perfect escapism for the summer reading season. Like the author I'm also a caver so this book had even more appeal to me - it's why I bought it. Although I would go along with much of Rollins' cave/cavern descriptions and the flavor of ""caving"", I did take issue with some aspects of it: his descriptions of rappelling (not they way we typically do it), the wormholes (don't believe this one, there are really no such things and we don't use skateboards!! - the author clearly invented it for the sake of the storyline), the batteries for the lanterns tended to last forever (would love to have their light sources), and the characters moved through the caverns remarkably well and quickly with all their gear, etc. Nonetheless, allowing for this ""poetic license"" and even some predictable plotting, the book is still worth a read. Enjoy!"
4,action-packed page turner,"Wow! I picked Subterranean up on a whim the other day and now I can't put it down! Every scene flows into the next, lots of suspense, lots of action, very well written. I like the storytelling: no endless digressions, he really sticks to the plot. I'm only 3/4 through it but I know the ending will be a surprise"
1,"Poorly Written, Bad Plot","I wanted to love this book ... but it was trash. When I read the reviews I was thinking of something like ""At The Mountains of Madness"" meets ""Voyage to the Center of the Earth"". What I got was a monster-slasher book with more hackneyed plot devices than I could count: the Muslim terrorist, the whining teenager, the Navy Seal searching for his brother. The sad thing is that the novel began well - he set up an interesting scenario. But within a few pages, you realize that the archeological mystery that the author has established is just a cheap facade on a Rambo story and the characters collapsed like the cheap 2-dimensional cut outs that they were. Boring."
1,"Very poor writing, not typical Rollins","I really hate to leave a bad review but this book was just awful. I really love Rollins, his SIGMA novels totally rock. However, this book was just plain dumb.The characters were very thin and very annoying. There was no development of the characters at all, other than there were a couple who were hot after each other, just irritating.The Jurassic Park theme was barely bearable but the characters were just so bad I could not finish it.I am very sorry I wasted my money on this pile."
4,It's Better to Read About Caving...,"I really enjoyed this novel. I didn't come to the book with any expectation except to be entertained by it, so I wasn't worried about the characters too much. I learned way more about glowing fungus from this than I would've elsewhere. Don't come to this book expecting Faulkner or Hemingway. Rather, expect to encounter a vividly imagined and horrifying underground world, and you'll probably enjoy it, too. And, you'll appreciate sunlight and being a great distance from canny reptilian monotremes."
4,One of Rollins' best,"If you are a fan of Jules Verne and Journey to the Center of the Earth then this book is definately for you. An expedition of scientists and SEALs travel deep below the earth where they find a completely different world, along with horrifying creatures. Full of adventure and action (especially the second part of the book when the creatures go on a rampage), this is a book that any fan of Verne will appreciate."
3,"Fast paced, mindless - predictable read.","Good story for those nights that you don't want to concern yourself with real issues of the day. The story is fast paced and has the obligatory good guy/bad guy theme with a few extras thrown in. For James Rollins' first book - it's not bad. The ending left me curious what happened to some of the main characters - other than Ashly and the Australian. However, other than the fact that the story takes place under Antarctica (which peaked my interests) - it's just another Journey to the Center of the Earth Story that meets cave men and dinosaurs in a diamond mine."
3,"Fast Action, Somewhat Predictable, Disappointing Ending","My boyfriend and myself overall enjoyed the book. JR's story line moves smoothly, and his knowledge of caves is apparent in his work. Unfortunately, some of his plot was predictable, and I have to agree with a previous reviewer, he could have built a little more on some of the characters. The ending seemed to be lacking and not to the standard of the beginning of the book. I will, however, say JR's choice of story line is intriguing and we are looking forward to his next creation."
2,Not impressed,I thought this book got off to a good start and was a good read until the end. The ending seemed rushed.
1,"Might make a movie, but. . .","I want to reiterate what others have said about Rollins needing to research the military more if he is going to use military characters - he had the same problem as Greg Hurwitz in Minutes to Burn - doesn't know anything about the SEALS, just knows they are the cool action heroes of the minute. Oh, yeah, and grammar is a GOOD thing. ;-) And, remembering the thread of your story. I listened to his book, Amazonia, and the audio edition was a lot of fun, with fewer flaws, so I guess he is improving. But, like so many of the adventure writers today - Matt Reilly, Jack de Brul - Rollins often reads like a fifth-grader telling a story, ""And then this happened, and then this, and this, and. . ."" Take a breath, create well-rounded characters, consult a reference book or two, and it will all come out well in the end."
3,SUBTERRANEAN.,"Introduced to James Rollins via AMAZONIA.SUBTERRANEAN proved to be equally entertaining.Interesting characters,unusual but exciting plot made the book a very enjoyable read."
3,Fast and furious adventure!,"""Subterranean"" is best-selling James Rollins' first novel - and it shows. Not nearly as sophisticated as his more recent novels but a fun read in spite of this fact.The premise is like a modern re-telling of Jules Verne's ""Journey To the Center Of the Earth"" filled with a government sponsered group of spicialists heading underground to the center of the world. It turns out their mission is two-fold - to discover valuable crystals and artifacts that reside there and also to find out what happened to the first group that went missing month's early (the latter reason is of course kept secret to the new group of explorers).What transpires is a mix of Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park - completed by the discovery of an ancient humanoid tribe living in the bowels of the earth. A fast and fun read and perfect for a beach chair!"
2,A somewhat decent thriller,"A team of specialists including paleoanthropologist Ashley Carter, her son Jason, spelunker Ben Brust, evolutionary biologist Linda Furstenburg and geologist Khalid Najmon (who is not what he seems) embark on a secrecy-shrouded mission to Antarctica, where a deep subterranean labyrinth has been discovered. There's red herrings and a romantic subplot between Ben and Ashley (as well as Khalid and Linda), and wild speculations about evolutionary pathways, marsupialism, what really killed the dinosaurs, and a completely underground thriving ecosystem where plants and fungi can be as deadly as animals.I loved Rollins's ""Amazonia"" but this book left me (no pun intended) cold. I didn't buy into Ben's ability to telepathically communicate with his ancestors. I might pick it up again from the library if I'm in the mood, but otherwise I wouldn't spend any money on it."
2,A Bit Tedious,"I read the author's book Amazonia before I read Subterranean. About half way through Subterranean I realized that it was almost exactly the same story, only below ground. I wouldn't have minded this so much, but the book was full of endless chase scenes which were all very similar. About half the book could have been successfully edited out. It would have vastly improved the pacing. Also, a few of the plot devices and characters were absurd or trite, such as The Arab Terrorist, and The Helpless Woman. I found myself becoming more and more annoyed at the characters as the story continued."
2,Another underground sci fi book,"This is my fourth Rollins book, I can see a trend here. Same old plot just different place. Books always seem to start out with a good story line and then go deep into sci-fi or not believable discoveries. Skip it."
2,Interesting but flawed.,"Rollins has give us a book that is well written and keeps the reader's interest throughout. However, the book is flawed by the political correctness that is apparent from beginning to end. The bad humans bring a blight into the world they find. One of the characters is a stereotypical Arab terrorist. Rollins also makes comments about the Earth's environment that show he is a tree-hugger and has bought into the fiction that humans are creating dangers to that environment. The book would have been much more enjoyable without these PC overtones."
2,"Learn from this one, Mr. Rollins","Characters make a story - hopefully Mr. Rollins will learn from his mistakes in this novel and put character before plot. Characters must evolve and grow throughout the course of a novel. These do not. Also, more accurate research Mr. Rollins, please! - or don't write about things you do not know."
2,Torpedo Subterranean,Book needed an editor with a sharp red pencil. Too wordy without adding to story. I find it to be a non-plausible scenario. Makes me wonder about all his other books.
2,"Started Off Good, Ended Hokey","Started off exciting, but took a turn for the worse. Struggled to finish the book. Had all the makings for a blockbuster action-packed thriller, but turned out to be hokey. The erect alligators, telepathic communication, naked half breed cave dwelling marsupials with Indonesian names, stereotypical characters, and contrived plot simply ruined the story. Rollins could have done so much better than this. But, as with all Rollins books it is always hit or miss. And, this one was definitely a miss."
5,Great Book,This is an excellent book. I highly recommend it. Don't read it before you go to bed unless you want to dream about this incredible world.
5,What an incredible book,"Once you start reading it, you won't be able to set it down. I even got yelled at by my boss for reading the book on company time. I've read it 4 times and each time is like the first time. There is alot of information to process so get ready be blown away. It's awsome. Also, if you missed reading Tino Georgiou's masterpiece--The Fates, go and read it."
2,"Good idea, LOTS of weak follow up.","I'm surprised at the reviews here. The worst comment I saw was, ""Bad use of Astralian accent."" Nobody mentioned that the accent comes and goes at random. How about the characters' clear knowledge of day and night while 2 miles below ground? Anybody wonder how the natives came up with a 26-hour ""day""? Apparently the author also decided that Australian aborigines somehow decended from marsupials!? You could also get a little annoyed with how incompetent Navy SEALS (and everyone else) are at holding onto their weapons. In one scene the heroine snatches a gun from the hero and snaps off a couple quick, accurate shots. A few chapters later she fires a pistol and the recoil jerks it out of her hand! Now, flaws aside, it was an entertaining book. I wish the editor had done more to pick out the poor logic to some of the script. If you are reading this review, keep in mind that many of the other reviewers start with, ""I'm only 13 but..."""
4,"Good job on a ""center of the earth"" story.","I thought it was going to be another ""Journey to the Cneter of the Earth"", but it turned out to be better. It held my interest right up to near the end. I did get the feeling that the author didn't quite know how to finish the story."
3,Maybe we should keep this one buried,"Stylistically, the novel succeeds in the most basic sense. The characters are developed to where a reader can empathize with their goals. The plot is of a classic adventure, shaped with deliberation. And the backdrop to the story, the setting and the secondary characters, are handled with a keen eye. Moreover, the narrator goes to some lengths to supply the reader with fairly in-depth scientific information, giving readers a superficial lesson or two about biology and geography. But with all that said, it is unfortunate that the narrator did not write at a higher level for those readers who saw the novel's characters as cartoonish, their motivations suspicious and the plot they found themselves in predictable. There were some great ideas offered in the book and the language was impeccable, it's just too bad a second rate story was the result."
3,...Where we have a simple entertainment under Antartica,"An expedition financed by private corporation goes under the glaciers of Antartica to explore caverns. In their journeys they will make interesting encounters, betray each other, fall in love...etc...It is an entertaining read. Nothing complex, don't expect to learn much in this reading. The Characters are extremes (the bad are very bad...and so on), the plot well thought but slow to come. Suspense...not really.A good book to read in a plane if there is'nt much else on the paperback rack. The Jurassic Park and Raptor crowd might appreciate."
3,Good start,"This book was the first one I read of James Rollins and I'll admit it did peak my interest enough to purchase his subsequent books. The characters at times seem a rather mixed kettle of characters that tend to distract one from what I thought should have been the primary story line, finding and exploring a lost civilization. It was not a great adventure like I would say ""The Seventh Scroll"" by Wilbur Smith but it was fun to read. I would recommmend some of his later works over this one, such as ""Deep Fathom"" or ""Excavation""."
1,Jurassic Park goes underground.,There are dozens of better books out there. The plot becomes predictable.... monsters jumping from behind rocks. The characters are shallow.
1,"Horrible! No, not the situation, the book!","Wow. I had seen this book, beckoning from the shelves, for weeks. It looked great... I read the back cover and was intrigued, so I finally bought it, took it home, and was completely disappointed. Thinly drawn characters, atrocious technical detail (since when does the Navy use the rank of Major, and what the hell is a CAR-1 carbine?), a horribly written and paced ""romantic"" subplot, and an overly cute little kid that I wanted to drown make this one of the worst books I've had the misfortune of reading this summer. I was looking for a modern take on Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth. What I got was a mishmash of ideas, settings, and characters that didn't hang together properly. Mr. Rollins, on the bright side, has some talent as a writer. Here's hoping he gets a better editor for his next book, whatever it may be."
4,Interesting and Odd,"The story was interesting. It's concept was intriguing. However, the story became a bit odd as more of the less logical parts came into play. Having humanoid monotreme, subterranean creatures and vast underground ecological systems got to be a bit far fetched. Great for escapist reading..."
2,Not the best...,"This was the first Rollins book I read. The story line was decent, but could have been developed better. There was too much gore - much more than was necessary.The main thing that got me was all sex. I mean, when most people are running away from a monster sex isn't usually the number one priority. Some of the events didn't seem logical.It's not one I would read again."
1,You are horrid imbeciles devoid of any insight or integrity.,This book can be most accurately equated to an 18 ounce can vacuum sealed full of rat excrement. You should all drink a gallon of bleach right before passing out unto the freeway.
3,Damn - used more than 400 times,This had a great premise and storyline. The action is good. But the writing is terrible. Every page has the word 'Damn' in it and 'Hell' in every other page. What did the editor do? Hope his other works are free of these flaws....
2,"Rollins' first book, and it shows...","It's a good thing I was first introduced to James Rollins through Sandstorm and not Subterranean, otherwise, I probably wouldn't have bothered picking up another one of his novels. Subterranean started off interestingly enough but then it quickly devolved from an adventure story into a comic book caricature of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth with the introduction of the humanoid marsupials into the picture. The book is not without merit, however, as Rollins is fairly adept at weaving several storylines and bringing them to a successful conclusion. I still recommend the book, if nothing else than for readrs to appreciate how Rollins has steadily improved his storytelling abilities with his subsequent works."
3,Rollins does get better,"This is Rollins' first book - so give him a break. The book was quite ridiculous, but it kept me entertained - and mainly - that's what I was looking for. I wasn't looking for a Pulitzer Prize winning book - just something quick and easy to read. I do wish that Rollins had done a little more with the underground world - instead he got into the stop the terrorist mode - but it was a nice try. I enjoyed many of Rollins' later works more and I will stick with him."
5,This was my first novel i've read it was great!,Great story i couldn't put it down! I'm only 13 and this is the first novel i've ever read and it was the best! I loved James Rollins imagination and the way he had ashley and ben fall in love in the adventure. I was kinda upset when Mo' amba was killed at the end and that everyone blamed Ashley for it but now there is a new bunble of joy to take his place!
5,New Age music at its best,I have owned this CD for years but love to listen to it over and over. The combination of instruments and composition of the pieces are unique and in my opinion typify what New Age electrified music is. It's just right for listening when I'm on the computer or working on a project. Too bad there was no sequel ever produced.
1,horrible,I purchased the product for tape recording lectures in school. I sat right up close by the professor. I took it home and it was impossible to listen too. I could not make out a word the professor was speaking and that was at the highest volume. After much arguing I finally got my money back. It is totally useless. Dont waste your money!!!!
4,Liking the lighted display,"While wandering around in the dark taking random tempertures, I find that the lighted display works awesome. Easy to read and not too bright that I have to readjust to the dark."
1,accurate temp gauge its not.,Not worth the hype. reading's are eratic. Cheap plastic housing. Not even worth the trouble of returning. Junk!
3,It works!,"It works, and that's all I could ask for. I used to get an idea about tire temps when doing any of my driving events. I know its that the right tool for this job, but I just need to get an idea of what the temps are to balance air pressure. For the money, it's a good deal."
1,Actron PocketTherm Infrared Thermometer,"Small, kinda chinsey. Cannot tell where the device picks up its temperature reading (no visual line to target). I have since seen better devices for not much more money. This should have cost half the price I paid."
3,You get what you pay for I suppose,Igloo has free shipping but the front is faux metal (silver plastic). If I had to do it over again I'd get the Emerson (stainless front)Emerson 8-Bottle Wine Cooler - Stainless Steel-- $20 shipping to NJ. Also the temp indicator is off; setting the unit to 52 degrees yields 60 degree wine --Actron CP7875 PocketTherm Infrared Thermometer. I believe the PocketTherm to be correct as it determined ice water to be 32/33 degrees.
3,Finger in the air,"A lot cheaper than other alternatives, probably because it's a lot smaller and not as fine a measuring tool. Seems useful for most applications: I wanted to use it for cooking and since it maxes out at 425 degrees that can be limiting. On the plus side, it's really easy to carry around in the toolbox."
5,does what it says,"There is a growing number of these gadgets out there. This one works as it was promised and is a convenient tool (and toy) for the gadgeteer. How much colder are the single pane windows than than the double panes? How cold is that floor in the bathroom? The speed at which you can make measurements is great. This unit is not as accurate as the precision it provides, but good enough. Incidentally, soon after it arrived I picked up ""A Matter of Degrees"" by Gino Segre at the county library - check it out."
4,It Does Exactly What It's Designed To Do!,"This thermometer is not fancy by any means, but its small size and simplicity is great for in the home. We use it mainly in candy making, but find other uses for it all the time."
1,Too cheaply made,"I bought this after my last laser thermometer was caught in a rainstorm and died. I wasn't able to get another just like it, so I thought I'd try something cheaper. Right from the start this thermometer showed signs of being inaccurate and it got steadily worse. Now, after only using it 4 times, it's off by almost 25 degrees. Buy something else. This one's not worth it."
4,IR thermometer,"when i got this product, the battery was dead, so i had to place yet another order of batteries for this, which isnt too cheap either. other than that, it works well."
4,A Paranormal hunter's quickdraw,"I had bought this items months back, with the intent of doing some paranormal research (Ghost Hunting). This item is fast to respond, very small and lightweight, and can switch between F and C. However I have found that it does not have terribly long battery life, and that it's thermal detection isn't laser guided, but collects more so from the air of the area it's pointing at rather than a focused spot"
3,"Meh, it works","It is ok, the battery is iffy on it and when I tried to open up the back and change the battery, the screw holding it on was so tiny it stripped right away. so I cant change the battery. It works for short bursts."
3,"Little thermometer, big appetite (for batteries)","- I've found the device can have a pretty big variance between readings... push the button 2-3 times and get 2-3 different values, but usually within 3-5%.- The CR2032 battery it comes with doesn't seem to last long; perhaps 100 measurements. Buy some here (<5$ for 10) or you'll pay too much at a retail shop. They should have made it a little bigger and put AAA batteries in it.- A lanyard ring would have been nice to avoid dropping it (it's pretty small)."
3,Only works very close to heat source,"This is small and kind of cool looking, which is nice. However, it has a 1:1 spot ratio, meaning that if you hold it even 10"" away from your hand, it will measure a 10"" circle, much bigger than your hand. The end result is that if you want to know how hot your coffee is, you need to hold it about an inch or less from your coffee cup. Even holding it 2 inches away seems to make the measured temperature drop a degree (which is ok since this is only accurate to +- 2 degrees anyway.Overall, for $18, it was a good buy, and will help me brew the perfect cup of coffee by letting me know what temperature the brewing water is. But I'm sad I can't aim it across my desk to see how hot something is."
4,SOO much smaller than it looks,Absolutely love this little thing! Allthough I was expecting a bit bigger item but. hey it still works! but there is not seen laser but works perfecty lol i carry mine around in my purse. I bought it for ghost hunting but havent got to use it for sutch as of yet.
5,Wow - this is great!,I like this alot - it was smaller than I expected but helps alot. Pretty cool device! Now sure how to use it in ghost investigation though. But I'll get a hang of it. :)
2,Actron CP7875 PocketTherm Infrared Thermometer,this product is ok for checking air condition vents and drafts.I use it to check my auto car air vents so will know when to service my air conditions
2,not what I was hoping for,"This thermometer has a beam that spreads out conically, instead of measuring a single point. It works great, but is far less useful than a pinpoint measuring system."
4,great product,"This is a great product. If I was going to buy another type, I would get something with a laser pointer on it as well."
3,"Seems work, nothing special","I got this to measure the temperature of my disk brakes and in our server room. On solid surfaces it does good and up close, but from a distance not so great. Seems to be okay for the price though."
4,not as cool as expected,I expect the eye drops to cool my eyes. But it does not create the cooling effects as I expected.
2,Maybe defective? but I am not sure,"I would have really liked this item except when I was playing the music, the singers were loud and clear in my left ear, and quiet on the right. However, the band played in both ears. I used the right file types so I am not sure if it was just the quality of the product or a defect. Unfortunately I put down quality so I think I won't be getting a full refund instead of defect which I know think I should have put. Anyone else have this problem?"
1,"If you have a Mac, don't bother with this player","This player worked poorly out of the box and has some kind of glitch in reading MP3 files. The support that came with the player had zero Mac info, ie user's manual, how to quickstart, etc. The website also has very limited Mac info. I had to call tech support to get them to send a PDF file of a users manual. The tech support staff may know a lot about PCs, but know diddly about Macs. This isn't a crime in and of itself, but if you are going to advertise a product as Mac compatible, it should be supported. They claim that they will have their Mac act together in a month or so, but what does the purchaser do in the meantime? Again, stay away from this one. I will be returning mine very soon!"
4,Good player but...,This is a great mp3 player. The sound quality is really good and the size is perfect. I really feel like the quality is solid and the little carrying bags for the cables and headphones are sweet. The only thing I wish iClick would have done was make some sort of cable management system for the headphones. I'm always untangling the headphones from the lanyard. It would have been cool to have a way of winding them up. Otherwise it's wonderful...I'm a satisfied customer.
4,Mac Compatible...excellent,"I've had the iClick 9.2 for about 1 week now and I really like it. I especially like it because it works with my Mac on OS.X. The sound quality is remarkably good, too. Only one downside...headphones should be a little longer. 1 star docked for that."
1,TDK Velocd,"I was only able to use this CD burner for less than a year. Suddenly, it stopped working. Contacting TDK customer support is a nightmare. There is no direct phone number and assistance is obtained by emailing a form. This burner is NOT worth the price."
2,Not compatable with some versions of Windows 98.,"This drive arrived promptly, the instructions were clear and easy to follow, the unit seemed great - except that it didn't work! After a couple of afternoons with the TDK support people (who were very helpful) I found that this system does not work with some versions of Windows 98. They apparently don't know which versions or systems are incompatable. I'm running Win98 SE v.4.10.2222A on a Dell Inspiron 3800 laptop. I'm giving them two stars for effort, but I can't say I'd recommend this drive."
2,Had to return,"I think the LATCH system is great - when it works correctly. These straps were very difficult to get attached - the red release should make them easier to use, but I found they made it more difficult than a standard hook (like the Evenflo model). And the buckles would not lie flat - they were always twisted which made tightening very difficult. I wound up returning and getting a different brand. Maybe it was just our car and seat combo that made it hard, but I don't think so."
1,UNSAFE,I tried using this product with 4 different seats. I have been trained to install seats and could not get the seat installed tight enough. The instructions say that the clips are to lie flat but it is impossible to do that when they are clipped in. The belt in that position does not pull tight enough. DO NOT USE IT! IT IS NOT SAFE! I ended up having to use my seatbelt even with my new car LATCH system. IT STINKS!
3,Not good for engineer,"This book may be useful for college students,I found a lot of theoretical analysis in it.But, if you are an engineer, and you want to find somethingto guide you to design a digital filter, forget this one.totally no help."
2,"Maybe I need to read some of ""Slade's"" earlier work...","I generally love novels that get involved in the little details. Sometimes, the extemporaneous parts of a book bring as much flavor to the text as the overall story itself. In this case, however, the extra information handed out by ""Slade"" accomplishes nothing but bringing the book to a painfully grinding, wisdom tooth extracting halt. A hundred pages could've been removed from the story without anything being lost, and it might've made things more interesting. I'm new to ""Slade's"" work, so maybe this isn't a new thing, but there were times when it seemed that the author was including information just to show that they've done some actual research on the subject matter. A nice enough read by the fireplace in the dead of winter, but I doubt I would've stayed with it if I had any sort of outdoor activities as an alternative."
2,Disappointed....,"Not as good as previous Special X books, seemed rushed to ending...very disappointing. Not as edgy or nerve rattling."
1,A new standard of ineptitude,"Without question one of, if not the worst books I have ever read. The writing is so ploddingly inept, predictable and devoid of basic flow and struture that you wonder if it is merely a first draft by a bad writer that somehow escaped an editor. Of all the books out there, I can think of no conceivable reason for anyone to ever bother picking up this piece of crap and attempting to read it. The only thing that is more alarming than how bad the book is would be the number of people here singing its praises. Anyone who thinks this is a good book is a moron."
1,"Ouch, is this awful",Wow. Wow. Has the authors ever even read a book before?Atrocious writing. Abysmal. Laughable. Inane. Gawdawful.
1,Michael Slade's worst novel,"The author admits at the end of the book to having written it on a bet. Well it certainly wasn't written to contribute to any further character development of the characters in his previous novels.The novel is the author's worst work to date, and I say that having actually enjoyed most of his previous novels. There is really no story here and most of the book is filled with historical notes few of which are germaine to the plot. There are a lot of fantasies and flashbacks to previous Michael Slade novels.Overall the book is boring and nearly unreadable. It certainly convinced me not to look forward to any other novels from this author."
1,Putrid,"A vast, empty train wreck. Obviously, the current incarnation of Michael Slade has forgotten everything that made previous novels so enjoyable.Absolutely awful. One of the worst books I have ever read.So badly written, you won't believe your eyes."
4,Slade is somewhat back,"I have to say, I was worried when Slade changed from a group of guys, to a father-daughter grouping. But, I was proven wrong. The sex, the violence, ah, reminds me of the books from the beginning. Though not as gruesome, and not as fun as Ripper. And the ending is not as surprising as Headhunter, but they did keep me guessing til the very end. I gave it only 4 stars because I'm comparing it to the other books. This isn't as dark and twisted as early novels. But it was definitely a great read, especially for the true Slade fans out there."
4,A good place to start,"""Wildlife and Landscape Ecology"" is a good reference for wildlife professionals and graduate students interested in large-scale questions. The book features 16 essays organized into 3 sections: Underlying Concepts, Landscape Metrics, and Application and Large-scale Management.With so many new books on landscape ecology, it's becoming difficult to tell them apart. I have found the following chapters especially useful: Bruce Milne's ""Applications of Fractal Geometry in Wildlife Biology,"" Pickett and Rogers' ""Patch Dynamics: The Transformation of Landscape Structure and Function,"" White and Harrod's ""Disturbance and Diversity in a Landscape Context,"" and Pearson and Gardner's ""Neutral Models: Useful Tools for Understanding Landscape Patterns.""While all authors but one are North American, the concepts discussed and examples provided are widely applicable."
3,Morel Like a Mat than a rug.,"This isn't a rug. It's more like a mat. That being said, it's pretty enough with a nice, rich look if you don't walk on it barefoot. however, There's no pile rug which makes it durable and probably washable which is probably the only reason I'll kept it."
1,Stained and worn,"This product was worn out and stained, there is no way this was new. It had to be a previous return. This product was not up to par, it was shameful. I sent it back the very next day."
5,Read this years ago...,"I write Southern Fiction (see below). As a Southerner, Southern people, lifestyle, etc. is one thing I feel I know. As I was jotting down some notes on elements I want to include in my current WIP (Work in Progress), I remembered this book, which I read years and years ago. I remembered laughing so hard I hurt. Mainly because it's all just so true. So, I came to Amazon to see if I could find a copy. Sure enough, this is it! Exact cover and everything! I loved it then and I love it now!Read it and have fun with it! It's just a hoot!Eva Marie EversonThings Left Unspoken: A Novel"
2,Too crude for me,"I read the reviews and almost made the mistake of sending ""Southern Ladies and Gentlemen"" to a family member recently moved to Georgia from New York. The book is certainly well-written, probably by and large accurate (but how can this Yankee know for sure), deeply perceptive, and generally entertaining, but it is also overly and unnecessarily vulgar. The author clearly delights in defining various Southern types using sexual imagery, depicted at times delicately, at times indelicately, and at times crudely. It is these crude parts I take exception to.Perhaps the author seeks to emphasize that beneath Southern gentility lies crudeness. I, on the other hand, emphasize that beneath crudeness lies gentility. And it's not just my preference, it's a fact.Sorry, I cannot recommend this book."
5,One of my all-time faves!,"I discovered Florence King years ago...and I LOVE her. She has an incredible insight into the workings of the Southern male and female and I howl with laughter every time I read this book!If you love a Southern woman and are trying desperately to figure her out, this is a perfect handbook for your trip to Tara. If you're a Southern woman and want the comfort of knowing that you are not alone in your strangeness, this is the book for you, sister.I recommend this book to all my friends. They have called me in hysterics and have asked for a ""tilted womb"" club.Florence King is a master!"
2,Incomplete Bridges in this reprinted First Edition,"This is a reprint of the 1st edition (1914); Bridges continued writing until his death in 1930. The 2nd edition (1936, reprinted 1942-47) includes more poetry, and a further reissue (1953) added his long work, The Testament of Beauty. You might as well seek out a copy of that 1953 edition (reprinted 1959-64), which at 700 pages is a much fuller volume. His lovely, perfect short poems are here in the 1st ed., though, if that's all you're looking for. ""Beautiful must be the mountains whence ye come, And bright in the fruitful valleys the streams, wherefrom Ye learn your song..."" (""Nightingales"")"
1,A new low for independent cinema. Buyers beware!!,"This is the story of a drug-addicted ex-child star that attempts a comeback. It is basically a depressing and pointless story that would have been better left untold. Made to look like a documentary, much of the dialogue is unintelligible due to poor sound quality. What can be understood isn't worth listening to. Definitely skip this one. It's terrible."
1,Worst film I have ever seen!!,"This is without a doubt the worst film that I have ever seen. Thank God I only rented it and did not buy it. Run, don't walk away from this film. It's not worth the time it took to pick it up from the video store. I have to admit that I watched the entire thing. It's kind of like watching a car wreck. You know you should look away, but you just can't. Somewhere in my mind, I kept thinking that it had to get better, but it only got worse leaving me wondering, what the hell were they thinking?"
4,Just relax,"My boyfriend and I used this this morning and it really works well. I think people are having a negative time with it because they aren't relaxing, if you're tense and stressed out things tighten up and that really isn't comfortable at all. I think that anal ez is ment to slightly numb the ariea not completely take the whole feeling away."
2,not good,I tried it with my wife it was real difficult for her she still felt the pain it didnt num her at all have to look for a different product
3,It worked... a little.,It numbs to an extent but ive only used it once. I might just need a little bit more practice ;)
5,Real Cherry,"I almost drank the thing it smelled great, not yet to try it, butt can hardly wait! lol she has no excuses now, cause I found the solution, when she says it will hurt to me, I'm going to whip out my Cherry Anal ease.."
1,Didn't help,At all. The good thing is that we found another way for me to work around this issue and just not use this product
2,no desensitizing for me,"product was not same as pictured... didn't seem to make any difference, don't waste your hardearned money on this overpriced cream"
4,Just Testing passes with Flying (V) Colors,"If you love Wishbone Ash you'll love ""Just testing"". Worth the price of admission just for their rendition of Master of Disguise. This would have rated 5 stars were it not for ""Pay the Price"". It just doesn't seem to fit."
3,The last album of the Mark II lineup,"Just Testing (1980) was the last album of the Mark 2 lineup. Production quality is superb, thanks to Martin Turner (bass, vocals, production). Contains the classic Wishbone Ash signature sound, with a bit of an electronic New Wave twist. Very ""tight"" musicianship. [After this album, Martin Turner left Ash to do his own production studio work.] Serious Ash fans should have this album, but let's face it, does it really deserve 4 stars compared to all albums ever made by all groups ?"
4,Just Testing by Wishbone Ash,"Overall this is probably one of Wishbone ash's best studio albums circa Mark 2 lineup. And definitely there most creative especially in the guitar solos. Just check out Andy Powell's solos on ""Insomnia "". The only thing I think could have been done better is the disticnct separation of the guitars which most of their live cds have. This makes this cd hard to determine which gutar player is playing which part? Overall there are alot of good songs on this cd especially the live takes of Blowin' Free and Helpless."
4,True music,"Excellent CD, great to drive by. Good sound and quality, true talent from the good ol' school!! Glad to have this apart of my collection"
1,Beware!Spicy Eye Drops,"I have very dry eyes and they stay red all the time.I usually just used the Clear eyes brands but the packaging caught my eye on this one.this eye drop was very irritating, spicy, causing tears and blurred vision.I've used it about 2 times and every time i get this burning, stinging sensation in my eyes,couldn't force my eyes open with a crow bar and the urge to rub my eyes constantly.Worst eye drops. DON'T BUY THIS."
5,Fun,"The best, absolute best thing about these eye drops is to get people to try them. the cooling factor that is indeed very refreshing, is also funny when people who never used them before try them."
5,No problems,This armband keeps my iPod mini in place with no problems. I am a girl and so I was nervous about getting one that would be small enough for my arm (although my biceps are getting bigger all the time!) ;) but this is perfect.
1,will scratch your screen,If you have a ipod video do not buy this cover. The clear plastic is not very snug to the screen and dust and grime will find it's way in between the clear plastic and your screen. You will not watch video anymore on your ipod after this.
1,jenn A,"This was complete disaster. The product was billed as a holder for the iPod mini. It is not. 2 size cases were offered - one too small and one too large, In fact, my iPod flew out of its holder at the end of a race - and cracked!!!! Now I have no case and no working iPod. A misery. Wish I was allowed to give zero stars."
1,Product not designed for IPod Mini,"Ordered the product to use with my mini - when I opened the box, it clearly states it is for an Ipod Nano and / or IPod Classic. Don't be fooled into paying for the shipping if you have a Mini - you will be returning it!"
1,...ouch,This movie misses on just about every level. A laugh a minute--but it's not what the filmmakers intended. I can't understand why this piece of trash DVD costs so much. Anything above five bucks for this and you're throwing your money away because ultimatly this disc is going to land on your coffee table as a coaster.
1,Alien Invasion Arizona,"This thing is trash.I rented it from one of the online rental companies and only got through 40 minuets of it. It reminded me of a bad Adult film, without the sex."
3,Cool monster but not much else to make it great.,The monster in this movie is really freaky and scary. It looks good but most of the movie is about inmates escaping their captors and going to a small town. They don't show the alien very much at all and isn't that what people want to see in this movie?
3,a product that would last for my years of college,"it's bulkier than i thought it would be. But i like the white personally. As a clock, it works excellently, however, not so good as a CDplayer/radio. A slight shake can pause the music for 2 seconds easily and i dont know if its because i live in a dorm or because it doesnt catch FM signals really well, i can never listen to good quality of music on radio.one more thing, it took me a while to figure all the functions."
3,"Great clock, so so CD and radio quality","My daughter falls asleep to a CD every night on a boombox, so when we decided she needed a clock in her room too, we replaced the boombox with this CD clock radio. The CD quality will suffice for a child, but for those adults who may want to turn up the volume every so often, you will probably be disappointed. I don't use the radio because we have really bad reception with mountains just south of us, but a digital tuner would have been nice. And what's with the built-in subwoofer? Amazon shows this as a feature but I have yet to find anything in my manual about it. Maybe I'm blind...but I'm not deaf...it certainly does NOT have the sound of a subwoofer. I would like to see a dual alarm LED with excellent CD sound, digital tuner, nap feature and nature sounds."
2,"From IDG? Should have been called ""IIS4 For Dummies""","I'm beginning to believe that there really are no thoughtful books on this subject. While the last few chapters are kind of neat, as one favorable reviewer wrote, most of the book seems to have been written by the author opening up the various ISM configuration dialogs and simply listing the options. There is no insight, no examples or anecdotes. He leaves you on your own to do your own explorations. I maight as well have saved my money and stuck with MSDN."
2,"Lather, Rinse, Repeat",Areas of this book are concise and easy to read. Other chapters repeat information from the previous chapters - and throw various acronyms at you without much explaining.Still searching for the ideal IIS study guide...
3,Deja Vu,"I thought I had lost my place while reading, since some whole sections are duplicated - word for word - between chapter 2 and chapter 3. The information was valuable the first time; but the repetion is a distraction. Is proofreading a lost art?"
1,Horrible!,"Without a doubt, one of the worst and most unhelpful books I have ever read. The examples are trivial. The step-by-step explanations are unimaginative and unhelpful. The book has manifest errors on NT security and IIS functionality. Whole sections are duplicated with out sense. The book is generally unacceptable. Avoid!"
3,Very Entertaining (a little short in Science),"This a book that talks about cloning (though I think you knew that already), what I did not liked is that this book is plagued with descriptions about the physical appearance of the authors, their families, the places they come from, their personalities, etc. Don't get me wrong, I admire this couple of investigators, what they did is a landmark in biological science, but I expected more science and less digresion. The scientific part of the book is interesting, you don't need to be an expert to understand the principles of cloning in this writing style. The rest of it is bearable. I recommend this book even though I disliked so many non relevant facts."
3,No sound,"I had this game earlier for XP and everything worked fine, but lost the cd and bought it again. I do not know if it is vista or what but I cannot hear anything. I have tried many but cannot seem to fix it. If anybody has any answers please let me know"
2,Jeopardy! 2nd Edition,The game is not user friendly. At least on my computer it doesn't keep multiple player interest.
4,hilarious look at life,"The book covers life from a womens viewpoint, and touches on many arenas that everyone can relate to. Especially funny are the chapters dealing with children; for example she talks about the different people that take over your kids bodies when they become teens; puberty and other topics. I enjoyed reading it very much and laughed most of the way through."
3,The Drama of Everyday Life,"Don't Need No Soap... is the memoir and musings of Bea Joyner. Ms. Joynershares her life and her thoughts on everything from parenting to watching scarymovies. The result is a light-hearted and good-humored book on everyday lifesituations. The title implies that the book will be loaded with drama, butjust the opposite is true. Ms. Joyner takes regular occurances that we all haveexperienced in some way and examines them with her own slant. She tells herstories in the same tone that she would talk to a girlfriend. Don't Need NoSoap... pulls you in and entertains in a down-home, folksy manner.Reviewed by Diane Marbury (HonestD)The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
1,ZERO STARS OUT OF FIVE!,"This movie is atrocious. The acting is bad, the plot is bad, but the thing I cant forgive is the absence of the gorilla. I love killer gorilla movies so much, I recorded it on my dvr. But when watching it, I found the absence of the gorilla dissapointing. And, when in the 15 minutes the gorilla appears, it looks horrible. I've seen and played video games from 1999 with better graphics. I instantly deleted the film, but the King of the lost world will forever leave a stench on the memory drive of my dvr. The king is the loser in this film which trys to be King Kong and the Lost World at the same time. Dont ever but this movie."
1,One of the Worst Films EVER!,"This movie is horrible. I bought it as an impluse buy (lesson, never buy on impulse) and I thought, ""How bad can this be?"" Not expecting much I popped in my DVD player early one Sunday to check it out. Now, I won't go into details since many other reviewers already gave the basic plot. This movie looked like it was made by drunk college students. Like many sci-fi lovers, I sometimes like a good 'bad' movie. This was waaaaay beyond bad. Save your cash. Like a previous reviewer I won't even sell this to another person. The 1976 KING KONG is a gem compared to this trash. Do yourself a favor and don't waste 85 minutes of your life."
2,"Fun, Confusing, ""Lost""","""King of the Lost World"" looks and feels similar to the ""Lost"" television show. The giant gorilla makes as much sense as the giant spider, the mysterious survivors-become-tribesmen, and the airplane dead zone. And the carnivorous vines. And the flying dragons. If any of this sounds appealing, then watch this movie.""Buts"" . . . Bruce Boxleitner's character is one-dimensional. Some of the other characters become two-dimensional, almost three-dimensional, but most are interchangeable. The special effects are rushed but really don't make the movie any worse. The DVD extras add to the movie, but the movie tries to be too many things to be successful.And, yet, it deserves two-stars for effort. KotLW is not as bad as it sounds, and it is much better than many Asylum movies."
1,"Wow, and I thought ""The Da Vinci Treasure"" was bad!","If you thought THE DA VINCI TREASURE, released from the master-of-error company, ASYLUM ENTERTAINMENT, was bad, then you haven't seen this! This is just some shameless ripoff of KING KONG, JURASSIC PARK, and the stylish TV series LOST.STORY: Four plane crash survivors land on an island known as the ""Lost World"" where they come across many sloppy CGI creatures that look so fake and unreal. Then, the fakest looking one, Kong (as you guessed, a ripoff of the classic KING KONG), is discovered by a sexy stewardress. Before you know it, fake CGI creatures are everywhere!THOUGHTS: HAHAHAHAHAHAH! What a loser! Just type in ""Asylum home entertainment"" on IMDb and you find a lot of the movies have 2.1 ratings. As for this, this was worthy of that rarting (if not a 0.0 rating.)Seriously now, amazon is LONG overdue of a 0 rating.AVOID THIS RIPOFF AT ALL COSTS!"
2,I Mean Really????,"Not sure what to say....I'm a very long time Bruce Boxleitner fan - since his days as Luke Macahan on How the West Was Won back in the 70's,the movie Tron, and I'm an absolutely huge fan of his 80's series Scarecrow and Mrs. King. If you are a Bruce Boxleitner fan you will probably be disappointed in this movie. Not so much for his part in the movie as the storyline itself.I'm sorry but.... giant spiders? giant scorpions? a King Kong re-incarnate and pterodactyls??? This is definitely B movie material. Don't get me wrong... there are some B movies I absolutely love. This is definitely not one of them.Bruce... Bruce... Bruce... You need better material to work with than this!!!"
1,Wheres the gorllia,"I saw this movie today and it was terrible the cgi was bad and there wasnt a god gorllia instead theres dragons.This is a ripoff of lost,kingkong,even jurssic park!The natives are stupid to they show them more than the gorllia.In the end the gorllia fights the dragons then he holds the front of the plane and explodes.Not reccomand."
3,"""I Give it a 3"" <--- from the old American Bandstand Days.","This book is fun, informative but lacks depth as far as a real source of topics. And, the dialogues/jokes? at the bottom of every explantion page are a bit lame. But the cartoons are cute......."
3,fine for higher level students,"The pictures are a tad cheasy, but the concept here is smart and fun, and the entries are short (a mere paragraph in length) and would work well as a warmer, or an addition to a larger discussion on birthdays, weddings, family, holidays, etc.Be warned, however, that the language is at a high advanced level. I actually test ran this book this afternoon with an intermediate student and, though she was amused by the goofy pictures and really curious about the topics, she struggled with the readings. For example, in the section on why we cover our mouth while yawning, the text explains that, ""covering the mouth...is considered good manners and stems from two beliefs: that covering the mouth safeguarded against the soul's premature departure; second, that an open mouth was an invitation for lurking evil spirits...""A bit disappointing-- I would really love to have used this with inter/beginners. I hope the publisher considers putting out another edition!"
5,101 American Customs,I loved this bood for my foreign exchange student. It was funny and so true of some of our crazy American Customs. I wish there had been something like this for me to read on his Danish Culture.
4,This Is Good Ya'll,"Back to the classic's. ""Devotion"" live, ""Feel the Fire"", ""When You Touch Me"", ""You And Me"", ""I Do Love You"", all bom-bay. Smooth Grooves has don it again. It's a must have if you serious about your oldies."
3,Works,"This thing works great for cutting large limbs (I use it on a fairly large palm tree). I only give it 3 stars due to the fact the dadburn handles keep coming loose and extending on their own. I wish there was a way to securely lock them in place. I am keeping my old one with fixed handles to use after I make the primary cut with the extended handles. Sure would be nice just to have one tool, Oh well it was a great thought........."
4,another hit by Mike Schafer,"Another good book about Mike Schafer, very comprehensive but in my opinion a bit unsatisfactory about interurban trains that played a key role in moving people around for over 40 years in the whole America"
5,Flannel Kings,"Took a chance purchaseing these flannel sheets and suprised, they fit great on the king bed. Nice quality and warm for the winter months. Shipping was right on too."
1,DO NOT LIKE THE CHARGER and 8 HOURS,"First of all the charger takes !!! 8 hours !!! to charge 4 aaa batteries. I do not know if you have kids but that is terriable. So you push the slider up and down to squeeze the batteries into it's jaws to charge it. Then ... gravity comes into play. There is hardly any friction to hold the charger slide in place. So after about 15-30 minutes the slide, well of course, slides down and then it stops charging. Yeah.. now i get to start all over again. So in other words check out their 15 minute version... yeah that's right 15 minutes.. not 8 HOURS.***************** RANT STARTED *****************Why would they even make an 8 HOUR version.. sigh never mind .. back to the store.. all yeah and of course the down put in big letters ""ONLY 8 hours"" like the other ""ONLY 15 MINS"" live and learn...****************** RANT OVER ******************"
1,Avoid this Cheaply Made Charger,"Small; lightweight; charges all battery sizes of NiCad's.Would be great if the thing was reliable.Within 2 months of charging the bottom ""slide out"" portion of the charger stopped making sufficient contact with most batteries.Within 3 months the top portion stopped making contact with double-A's.Flimsy cheaply made. Will bust on you with any amount of normal use.Attempted to return; was told ""only un-opened packaging of ""electronics"" could be returned; was then told ""contact the manufacturer."" Did so; was told by Energizer that the warrantee was for 90 days...""sorry sir.""Avoid this cheaply made poor reliability you might as well flush your money down the loo the customer is now the quality de-bugging test lab LOUSY charger."
1,POS - Dont buy it,"Im taking it back today. This thing is flimsy and cheaply built. Its got a sliding drawer to extend the capacity of the charger...yeah, thats gonna be working in month."
1,Doesn't charge high capacity NiMH,The product is slick in that it has a sliding compartment. The biggest problem is that this charger won't fully charge any battery more than 2500mAh. And it doesn't state this anywhere on the package.
1,Very short lifespan.,"Well, it worked as advertised the first four or five times I used it. Now its dead. Tried everything imaginable to make it work. Nope. Nada. Just will not charge my batteries at all. Should have read the reviews here first. Just stay away from this product."
2,Gets the job done...technically.,"It's a battery charger; it charges batteries. It's called 'compact' because the bottom part accordians out to reveal 4 additional slots for batteries. It feels cheaply made, and doesn't hold the batteries very securely. Also, you have to charge two batteries at a time (or sets of 2), and they are inserted in opposite directions. So, if you're charging 4 batteries in 2 sets of two, they would be + - + -. I realize that's how most devices are set up when you insert the batteries, but I shouldn't have to worry about that when inserting into a charger, especially since (according most warning labels on batteries) inserting it in the charger backwards may cause an explosion resulting in injury or death. That's a lot of pressure for someone who just wants more juice for his Gameboy.Ultimately, it does what it says though. So, if you're looking for a charger to use until you find a real charger, go for it."
3,Good but not great,I really like the idea of the terrorist creating the earthquakes and the character Judy Maddox but I felt (like most reviewers) that their are huge holes in this plot. This is like a summer blockbuster movie that you liked while watching it but afterwards you think about it and realize how that could never happen.
4,"Good, fast, read, just open it and enjoy the ride!","I really enjoyed this book. I'm from CA and have lived in both southern and northern parts of the state which, for me, added a degree of realism that I really enjoyed. It was refreshing to see Ken take a different path, away from epic, historical novels and try something wholly modern. I applaud him for doing that. Sure, it wasn't as tight as ""Pillars Of The Earth,"" but, as always, he did his homework before writing this one, and it was obvious. If you're looking for a fast moving, page turner, and a book that allows you to put your critiquing mind to rest and just relax and go for a ride, then this is your book!"
4,Did I Feel the Earth Move?,"I will admit, that being from California and particularly the S.F. Bay Area, I happily identified with the novel's setting and the subject of earthquakes. I enjoy all of Ken Follett's novels and the Hammer of Eden was an enjoyable read. After reading one of his books, you will be spoiled by the suspense...and other author's novels will pale in comparison, with a few exceptions, of course."
2,He's written better...,"I agree with many of the comments stated thus far; this was not one of Follett's better novels. The storyline is interesting, but he focuses too much on unnecessary subplots (eg the sexual deprivation of a main character). It reads very much like a script from the latest (insert Big-Name-Actor here) action movie, which is not bad in-and-of-itself but I expected more after reading some of his other novels. If this is the first Follett novel you've experienced do yourself a favor and read The Pillars of the Earth...I guarantee that you will not be disappointed as it is fantastic."
4,great book!,"it was very suspenseful, i couldnt put it down! great book to read if you like thrillers."
3,Too Many Mistakes for a Quake,"bought the book because as a previous reader of Ken Follets' most notably the Pillars of the Earth thought he would deliver. Yes, what was read out of touch. Ken gave tribute to notables in California, but forgot some things, like it does not take minutes to hang up the phone in the presidio to take a helicopter across the bay. or even drive across the bay in LESS THAN MINUTES. check out page 417, where sloppy writing ensued and i only point this out, because i was livid with the timing aspects in his latest novel. the lingo, well, who says ""he got clean away"", i cringed when i read that."
2,Not up to par...,"Ken Follet really falls short in his latest book. The Hammer of Eden contains none of the character devices, which Follet used in his past books to capture the reader's attention, such as espionage and deceit. Sure, The Hammer of Eden has the classic Follet plot, with revolutionary elements and told from the point of view of the antagonist. But this book falls short of some of his classic masterpieces such as Triple, Eye of the Needle, Key to Rebecca, and Night Over Water.I believe Follet needs to stick to his greatest gift, writings of espionage, instead of the contemporary time period and Eco-terrorism."
3,Not his best effort,"This book never worked for me. It is not that it was poorly written or there were not well drawn characters, I just did not like anyone in this book. I found myself wishing they would all go away."
1,ho hum,not follett at his best. the idea is good but the book didn't develop well-would've liked a slower buildup to let me get into the characters and that would've helped me accept where the story was going - very creative; but got there too fast.
1,"Simplistic, sophomoric, and shameful!","It appears as though Mr. Follett has a book contract he must fulfill. ""Hammer of Eden"" as well as the ""Third Twin"" are quite evident of the fact we are writing only to fill a quota. ""Pillars of the Earth"" is a masterpiece. A ""Dangerous Fortune"" is genious. ""Hammer of Eden"" is better than ""Third Twin"" but this is like saying coming in 87th place is better than 90th! This book is not what I expect from Ken Follett, he is a much better writer than this."
5,It is great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book kept me engrossed in it for a while. It was an exciting and thrilling book. I almost counldn't put the book down!!!
1,UNBELIEVABLE,"It is unbelievable that the man, who wrote Eye of the Needle, wrote this book!! With gravest doubts I immediately checked up on The Hammer of Eden in Amazon.com. Most unfortunately my fears were unfounded - the Name had not been plagiarised, it was indeed Ken Follett's work!"
2,You almost know the end of the book at the begining,"The problem of this book is that you know in the first pages who is the bad guy, so you know that he will have to lose at the end. The way they are living in the village I think that is a little bit out of the reality."
2,Read a different Follett book,"I wish I had read the reviews before reading this book, however it was a gift so I dove in. Follett is one of my favorite authors, but this book doesn't even seem to have been written by him. It reads like it was written for a cheeseball action movie. It would probably appeal to a high school level boy. Follett has written some fabulous books, too many to mention. Pick one of them and pass on this dog."
3,"Not great, but not all bad either","Ken Follett has written great books (The Eye of the Needle, Pillars of the Earth) and really, really bad ones (Night over Water, A Place Called Freedom). This is in between. The way the psycopath terrorist is reasoning is interesting: you almost like him for a while. I think this could be a fantastic film, and I know who I'd like to see in it: Tommy Lee Jones as the terrorist, Joan Chen as the FBI Agent, Robert Prosky as her father and (possibly) Reginald VelJohnson (from Die Hard) as the governor's official."
1,Disappointment in Eden,"Knowing what a huge fan I am of Ken Follett, my husband made this book one of my Christmas gifts. I tried several times to bear with this and give him the benefit of doubt. Unfortunately, my doubts were well founded. I just couldn't believe this was the same author. Never saying anything to my husband, we were talking about books just last night, and he said, ""do you know the strangest book I've read recently?"", you've got it! He is also a fan of Mr. Follett's. I enjoyed all of his others, especially ""Eye"" and ""Pillars"". In ""Hammer"", the plot, the characters and writing were very sophmoric. I truly don't think they wrere written by the same author or he bet someone that his name could sell anything. Sorry, but I hope the next one fully redeems Mr. Follett to his fans."
2,Just missing that something...,"As an avid fan of Ken Follet, I was thrilled when he came out with this new book. The plot was interesting, but it just never grabbed the reader and got them involved in the storyline. The main villan just seems like another everyday psycho. What happened to the excellent espionage that Follet used to write?The strong and caring relationship between the FBI daughter and the SFPD father was a definite positive for this book.If you are a true-blue Follet fan, you will make it to the end of this book albeit with the hope that it gets better as you go along."
2,"ok, light and unlively","Follett is better than this. Not sure how much time he spent on this but he usually writes better thrillers than this. This was the first book I read on Christmas vaction and I could have invested my time better. If you live in California, you still might not be intrigued!!"
1,"""Hammer"" = Hohummer","Follett is, or was, a cut above today's pop novelists. Now, with ""Hammer"" following ""The 3rd Twin"", he looks to be coasting, at best. This book is boring, the premise is tenuous, and the characters are shallow. Even his trademark spicy sex is humdrum. The good reviews of this book by ""professional"" reviewers are simply showing deference to the author - undeserved. If you like Ken Follett and really want to read something good by him, I bet you have been deterred in the past by the length of Pillars of the Earth. Don't be - it's the last great thing he's written."
2,Rush Job,"Having read all of Ken Follett's novels I was very disappointed with this one. This is an entertaining thriller to read while you're on a plane or at the beach but Ken Follett can write so much better.I actually had the same feeling after finishing ""Eden's"" predecessor, ""The Third Twin"", which was that Mr. Follett did a very superficial job on the story. It could have been a good thriller but it's way below his usual standard.Read ""Triple"", ""Pillars"", ""Needle"" or anything else except Ken Follett's first two and last two novels."
3,Hardly earth shaking,"None of Ken Follett's books are really boring and all can keep the reader's attention during the reading of them. However, I can still remember clearly a number of scenes from Eye of the Needle more than a decade after reading the book. Only a couple of weeks away from reading The Hammer of Eden I can hardly recall anything significant about either the characters or the plot. The book was marginally interesting - primarily because of the plot set-up, which, however implausible was at least unique - but poor follow thru and limp characters result in a story that doesn't add up to Follett at his best. Too bad, because when he is good he is very, very good. Not here, however."
2,Can't compare it to his historical fiction masterpieces!,"Chiming right in with other reviewers, it is hard to believe that this book was written by the same author as Pillars of the Earth, Night Over Water, Dangerous Fortune and A Place Called Freedom. I can't say that I didn't find the book at all interesting, even though it was a bit far fetched. Although you can't fault an author for trying a new genre, the book lacks the richness in detail and character that makes his others such treasures. I look forward to a return to these qualities in his next book."
3,not follet in his best,follet is definitely loosing his grip on the storyline its not as gripping s triple or the eye of the needle ....having read all of his boooks from his first one thats all i can say moreover there isn't a Hindu name as KHAN (RAJA KHAN) even a child knows that Khan is a muslim surname itll br nice if follet did his research that just forming his own names ddr Sridhar Rathinam
2,nothing special,"The idea is original. But you know from the beginning how it will end, which is not the best thing for a thriller...... It's not worth the money."
1,I did not like it.,"I have read all of Mr. Follet's books and found the ""Hammer ..."" and the "".. Third Twin"" , his worst ones. I hope he returns to his old writing style, such as in ""The Man form St. Petersburg"" and ""A Place Called Freedom "". Otherwise I think I will stop reading his books."
2,Not even close to his best work.,"I've read every single book Follet has written and loved them all. This just isn't up to his normal level of excellence. Very predictable story line based on a nonsensical premise. It was never a ""can't put it down"" experience."
1,Don't waste your time,"Absolute garbage - if I could rate it a 0 I would. This is Follett? The writing is amateurish, the characters are buffoons, and the plot is so unbelievably stupid it's laughable. You won't care if the good guys or bad guys win at the end of this one - you'll just be happy it's over."
1,Horrible,"I only finished this book to see what to what depths poor writing and plot development could fall. Personally, I found that the only mystery in this book was how the author managed to use ""frisson of passion"" more than once.Avoid this book!"
4,Follett redeems himself,"I confess... I am a Ken Follett junkie. With his latest effort, Follett returns to his original formula to find success. This is classic Follett. Get to know the good guy, get to know the bad guy, see the good guy catch the bad guy. The bad guy/cult leader (Richard Granger) is one of Follett's more interesting antagonists... much cooler than the clone dude from THE THIRD TWIN. Although this is Follett's best stab at modern drama, I'm still waiting for him to return to his most proficient venue... historical fiction. This is no PILLARS, but it is more than adequate to tide over Follett-addicts such as myself."
2,ittalics......do you know what im thinking,"compared to other thrillers this is pure junk. Rather than developing an interesting read the author continuoussly reverts to ittalics to give insight into his characters thoughts... sophmoric,boring,dull. I would expect better from Mr. follett."
3,Where is the real Follet?,"After reading ""Pillars of the Earth"" I waited eagerly for every title since. Sorry to say but ""Hammer of Eden"" is one in series of very disappointing novels written by Ken the plots are very obvious and the characters you just wish they where more deep and detailed. I am waiting for his next ""Pillars of the Earth"". But still he is one of my favorite writers."
2,LETDOWN,Even by the longest stretch of imagination i could not imagine how on earth a writer who has written classics like EYE of the needle can write such a potboiler.BElieve me this is not a bad book at all infact it is quite a page turner but for some1 who has set a very high standerds for himself this 1 falls short of expectations.But still worth a try if you have nothing to do on a lazy sunday afternoon you can try this book.
2,This is Follett garbage,"A totally unrealistic story about a commune making earthquakes. The leader is so smart but never learned to read or write. With his smarts he should have know how important reading and writing are and should have been able to pick it up rather easily. He can make everyone like him, both men and women. From what is written I don't see it. I understand about office politics but for all that Judy accomplished she would not have been overlooked on any level. That is just the first part of the book. Very stereotypical the way she is smarter than her superiors. So many of the characters are stereotypes (the people in the commune and the members of the FBI, for example). The novel is well written, but this novel is just a total waste of time with an unbelievable story and unbelievable characters. I'm still waiting for Follett to write another great book like ""TRIPLE,"" still my all-time favorite Ken Follett novel."
4,Great book!,"I know this book got a lot of bad reviews, but I really enjoyed it! Yeah, maybe causing earthquakes is a little far-fetched, but so what, this was a great story. I found this book suspenseful, I enjoyed the characters, had a hard time putting it down at times. I highly recommend this one!"
2,Gag me!,"As a fan of Follett's books, this one is a disappointment. I suspect that he was short of cash when this one went to press. It has little of the quality, in-depth character portrayal that I've seen in his other books and the story line is pure fantasy, not just fiction. Not recommended."
3,Really a 3.5 stars,1) I listened to the audio book version of this and afterwards felt like it was the better choice than actually reading the paperback version.2) The audio book version was well presented and well acted by the reader3) The story seemed to have the following flawsa) formulaic plot - I knew what was coming before it happenedb) one dimensional characters...except Priest - leaving a lot to be desired from the rest of the castc) had to suspend belief in the whole earthquake theoryI thought it was enjoyable on tape but on a whole I wished it was better.
2,Hammer of Eden,Some of Follett's books have captivated me for weeks after I finished them. This one wasn't even interesting while I was reading it. I hope Ken can get back to the topics he knows about and quit writing formula books that don't do his talents credit.
2,A contract book,"This reads like a contract book - one which is written to fulfill a contract. Typically well-written but still a weak Follett product when I have grown accustomed to much, much better.If you are a true, can't-have-enough fan of his, then fine this fits the bill. If you like good fiction, try something else."
3,"Lame, predictable story.","This was the least interesting, most predictable mystery by Ken Follett I've read to date. Just a really lame story considering several others I've read by him."
2,Still a Follett Fan,"I am a long standing Ken Follett fan. I consider The Pillars of the Earth to be one of my all time favourite books. A magnificent, sweeping, all consuming tale, well worth a reread. Unfortunately, The Hammer of Eden falls far short of the mark. Like the slow low-rumblings of the seismic generator it chronicles, this story rolls on to an all too predictable conclusion. I felt like I was reading a hastily written treatment for a made-for-TV-movie; complete with shallow characters and trashy sex scenes. Too bad I started longing for commercials."
4,Nothing is impossible.....,"Causing earthquakes to save your home....it could happen. anything is possible. now granted I have read only a few of Follet's books...but I believe this is a good one. It opens up your mind...and shows the craziness that a person would go to save their family and/or home. Like the Third Twin, this was another fast and entertaining read. Which is good, since I dont have much free time to spare while in college. It is worth your time."
1,Bad News,"I sympathise with the editor of Hammer Of Eden who had to stifle the urge to re-write Follett's terrible prose. It's a wild plot with wild characters , but the writing is incredibly bad. Has Follett made so much money that he no longer cares what carries his name?"
1,Bummer of Eden,"This book is replete with poorly chosen and ineptly described characters. At times, I felt the linguistic analysis was overblown. look elsewhere"
2,OH PLEASE!,well another follet novel has come and gone and as for me this one was an earthshaking bomb! the story is at least well written (which is his specialty) but the premise is a little weak. (LITTLE?) but it got me away from my family for a while so if thats what you are looking for then by all means go for it.
1,Terrible book!,I should have read these reviews before buying the book. Ken Follett's writing has been generally very good but this book's author needs to go back to Basic Writing I in highschool! Use the $$ I wasted on this book Ken and take a good writing course.
2,A light read rather far fetched,"Characters are somewhat unbelievable. The methods of detection by the FBI are simplistic. However, it is interesting."
4,Page turner!!,I really enjoyed this book. It is unlike most of Follett's work but the story and the premise kept the pages turning. The locale was also interesting (being from the Bay area originally and in the earthquake of 1989) and the technology seemed credible. Highly recommend.
3,"A good read, but Follett needs to set his books in Europe.","I enjoyed this Follett book, and read it in a single sitting, as I always do his page-turners. However, ever since he started moving the settings of his novels to the United States, his authenticity has suffered. Most noticably in The Hammer of Eden. As an American, familiar with the culture, geography and language covered in his book, it was obvious that the work was written by an outsider looking in. The flaws were just distracting enough to remind me that the work was fiction, thus breaking me out of my escape into the world of Follett's storytelling. I miss being transported to unfamiliar worlds with absolute trust, as in Pillars of the Earth, and even his earlier, less noteworthy work. That said, I still think The Hammer of Eden is well worth reading, and I would recommend it without reservation. I will continue to read anything Ken Follett writes. I just wish he would take me back to England, or at least Europe, next time."
1,"Ken Follett, where are you?","As a rule, I jump at the chance to read anything Ken Follett writes. This book is worthless. I wish Mr. Follett would return to his former self and write the blockbuster novels for which he is known!!!???"
2,poor attempt by a formerly interesting author to write a thr,"i started reading this book with some hesitation. it seems to me that mr folliet's writing have contiued declining in quality and interest from his former works, most especially ""eye of the needle"". ""hammer of eden"" is better suited as a marvel comic rather than a novel format. the characters are so thinly written as to be little more than opaque and the various plots within the story just don't stand up to reality. finally, the fact that there still exits a commune that seems to have been successful in its efforts after 25 years only to fall lock-step into the wishes of an illiterate flake does us former hippies a disservice.tbcha@epix.net"
1,More a movie screenplay than a novel,"I liked many of Ken Follett's earlier novels very much, which makes _The Hammer of Eden_ even more disappointing. It's hard to believe that this book was written by the author who wrote such gems as _Eye of the Needle_ and _Pillars of the Earth_. The plot of this book is derivative, predictable, and incredible (in the literal sense). The characters are cardboard, the dialog is wooden, and the action appears to be written with movie special effects in mind. The book is, at least, mercifully short. Don't waste your money on it."
2,A scientifically inaccurate movie script,"This is definitely not one of Follett's better efforts. I agree with Mr. Blake that it's not a novel, but rather a movie script. Also, the main plot device, that a seismographic truck could cause an earthquake, is false. The energy that a truck could exert on a fault is a function of the mass of the truck, which is miniscule in seismological terms. If a fault were so unstable that this small amount of energy would trigger an earthquake, the small earthquakes which are common in California would have triggered it long ago."
4,Great Note taking device,"I use my Sony ICD-P210 as my ""todo"" list. I also record college classroom sessions. I do agree with the other reviewers that this device doesn't record music well but for a classroom discussion this thing works very well especially on the High Quality setting. I kept my Antivirus on while installing this software and had no problem - the software is very easy to use! Great for personal logs (journal)/todo list/college classroom (especially if it is in a discussion format)."
1,Don't get it...,Its not Windows 7 compatible. You will not be able to get your files off of it. Sony seems to orphan their recorders. I will personally never buy a Sony one again.
5,A classic biography for all ages!,"I really loved this book. I used it as a read-aloud for my first grader and preschooler, as it was a part of out homeschooling curriculum. I loved the innocence of Benjamin West and the relationship and respect he had for his parents and their Quaker beliefs. It had me wishing for simpler times. Best of all, my young kids loved the story and would beg for ""one more chapter"". If you like this book, you should check out ""The Valentine Cat"" by Clyde Robert Bulla."
4,Amazingly comfortable!,"I tried on this bra in a store and wanted to see if they had a larger size (they don't, by the way).I'm a 42J-42L, depending on what brand I buy. This makes it INCREDIBLY difficult for me to find a bra that fits, especially a strapless one. The largest size that this bra comes in is a FF. I ended up trying on the 42FF at the store and though, no, it didn't fit exactly as it should (being that it was at least 4 sizes too small in the cup), it fit very well everywhere else and held me up great! The longline bra was very comfortable fitting and made me feel beautiful. I cannot wait to see how it will fare under my wedding dress. I figured that what wasn't held in in the cup will most definitely be held up in my gown!Can't wait to receive this from Amazon. This happened to be the cheapest one I could find!Thanks!"
2,Did what it was supposed to but broke after one use,This bra was great in terms of support (I wear a DDD) BUT I wore it to one wedding and then one additional time to try on my own wedding dresses and the wire poked right out of the top of the casing. I bought it at a Lady Grace store for about $45 and I am going to take it back and hopefully get a replacement - maybe mine was an isolated problem bra - who knows?The only other thing was that it was kind of hard to get on by myself because it has A LOT of hooks!
1,Unsatisfied,"I ordered this from Macy's, although I found it on Amazon: I wanted to be able to return to store, and i'm so glad I did. I'm a bra size 40F, and when I tried on this bra it was too small around and too big in the cup. I would have just exchanged it, because the lace is pretty, however the bra was much shorter than pictured and created horrible bulging. NOT HAPPY, self esteem killed.The next day I went to Macy's and returned it, and then went to David's Bridal for some real help. Turns out the bustier sizes run really funny, and instead of a 40F, I had to order a 46B. Whoa.I would recommend this bustier for skinnier girls, who don't need to worry about bulging. Otherwise, I'd say go to David's Bridal IN STORE, and have them help you. Even if it's just to find out your bustier size."
1,not for plus size,"i usually wear a 36DDD i ordered this bra in 36 G because these bras do run small. it was not even close to fitting, the cup size is a C at best and it was at least 3in. short from closing. really bad Quality Control on this brand, it is too bad there products are so small."
1,HORRIBLE FIT!,"I ordered this for the wedding, ONLY because it was the only one I could find in my size. Huge disappointment. I ordered a cup size smaller (B in stead of C) because I've noticed allot of people say they run big. They aren't kidding. I got it and tried it on, and wow, it seems to be at least a D cup. I fit into a C cup perfectly and it was huge on me. I would not order this again, even if I did find one that fit correctly."
1,Not one good thing about this bra.,"This bra is terrible. The straps are ridiculously long (twice the length of any other bra I own when I have them adjusted to the longest point). There are extra ""underwires"" on the sides of cups. Imagine parentheses around your nipples. Its hideous and uncomfortable.And if you are considering taking the straps off their are 2 little tabs that stick out from the top if the bra."
2,Not supportive for women with larger chests,"My partner and I each bought one to wear under our wedding dresses. They arrived at 1 PM on Tuesday and were back at UPS at 3 PM on Tuesday because even with professional measuring, these bustiers did not fit properly and they were not at all supportive. If you consider this bra, I'd try to find a stockist to make sure it's right for you."
4,great strapless!,I just received it and it fit like a glove. I usually wear a 38C but in plus size I have to go with a 44B. This fit just a touch bigger in the cup but i'm guessing an A cup would just be too small. The fit is really perfect and very sexy. I can't wait to wear a strapless dress just to wear it! highly recommend!
3,Careful w/sizing!,"This bra seems like it would have done the job if I had gotten the right size. I normally wear a 42D, but as per previous recommendations, I ordered a larger band and smaller cup (46C). The band size was a little big, but the cups were huge! They are also a little pointed. A smaller cup may have remedied the problem, but it was cut a little too high for the dress I was wearing it with. I have read that most of these style of bras tend to have a pointed cup. I would order a band size larger and 2 cup sizes smaller. It seemed to have good support, though, it is just cut kind of high, so its not good for really low cut dresses or shirts. If any cleavage shows, this bra will probably show as well."
3,"Sucks you in, but doesn't provide a great lift","I like the waist definition this bustier gives me, but I don't love the bra part of it. It does not give a great lift and in fact kind of flattens me out. I still wear the garment but it can make you look a bit odd under certain clothes. Also, the seams will show through thin material, so be aware of that before buying!"
5,Awesome Strapless Bra!,"I am a 40D, and bought a 42C the first time around. The 42 was perfect, but the cup size was still a little big - so I also ordered a 42B, which is much better! The bra is incredibly supportive, comfortable, and keeps my stomach sucked in! As other reviewers have stated, it does sort of give you pointy boobs, so if you are going to wear a thin shirt, this may not be a good bra choice. However, with formal dresses made of thicker material - it is amazing! I will never wear another strapless bra again, I'd give this 10 stars if I could."
1,Bruised Boobs,The wire @ the top of the cups digs into you chest (it will bruise you). Wore it for the wedding and will never wear it again... to uncomfortable. Look's nice though.
2,HUGE,"I did read all the reviews, and decided that since I am in between sizes that I would be safe ordering the smaller size. I ordered a 34B seeing as most of the reviews state the back is too small and the cup is too big. However, the bra I recieved was huge all over. The back was too big, and not snug in the slightet. And the cups were HUGE, in my aproximation they would fit a small D. The price is great, and it looks nice. Too bad it doesn't fit."
2,Didn't work for me,"This just didn't work well for me. The lace was scratchy, the cups were too big, and it was *incredibly* hard to put on.The first might have been helped by washing it, and the second suggests that I might need something other than my usual size. But given that I would only be able to wear it when I has someone to help me get dressed, it wasn't worth going through a cycle of exchanges to try.Mind you, all of those things have also been true of other long-line bras I've tried. I may need to just give up. YMMV."
3,"High Cut, Good Quality","I ordered this longline with a few others to try out for my January 2013 upcoming wedding. This one I loved the moment I pulled it out of the package. I tried it on and it was comfortable and a great fit. The only issue was, the top of the cups come very high! My dress is rather modest and does not show any cleavage or anything of that sort what so ever and this bra still showed well above the top of the dress! Very disappointing because this bra seemed to be so well made! If you are wearing a very high cut garment, this bra is a winner!"
2,MADONNAESQUE,Returned It.The reviews for this sold me on it but I ended up being very disappointed. I purchased this to wear with a sweetheart neckline bridesmaid dress.The cups aren't at all what I was expecting or hoping for; they lack contour and shape. I felt as though I could audition for a Madonna music video.
5,Fits great and feels sexy,"I can't wait to try this on with my wedding gown, it fits me great, i love the way it feels all around (Especially the girls!!) I am a 38C, fits perfect."
1,Beware - sizing is off,"I purchased this in hopes of wearing a strapless dress. I purchased my normal size, and it was extremely small! Beware."
3,you cant sit down,"I love to wear women underwear to work. ha ha this i not . not the most comfortable , I would recommend a different choiceTommy"
5,This is a true asset for software companies!,"There are many ways for a software company to spend its money, but for best ""bang for your buck"" this software design wake-up call ranks near the top. My own small business has already seen a benefit, worth much more than the price of the book, by taking to heart much of what is presented in this book and applying it to a software product currently in development. There are few books I will actively recommend to others -- this is one of those few.Although the book uses the older versions of Windows for many of its examples, it is by looking beyond the examples to the underlying meaning that the reader will see obvious applications on any system, including the World-Wide Web."
3,Relevant and powerful thoughts....poorly written,"After reading Alan Cooper's latest book, The Inmates are Running the Asylum, I immediately bought this book for more specific information regarding Mr. Cooper's design ideas. Hooooo, boy! This thing is SLOW! The author steps through each piece of the user interface, bit by bit by bit, and writes entire chapters on what seem the most trivial details. Truth is, though, his points are valid and thought provoking, but his writing is more tedious than Tolstoy. If you want a good overall philosophy of design, buy his more recent book...it's much shorter and much, much more fun to read."
1,"Sophmoric, Disjointed, Overly Creative","I bought this book thinking that it might be something that I could give to our programmers to help them in designing our software. The book is written in a style akin to James Joyce. He creates a whole ration of new concepts (ie, ""what I call 'Interrogation Mode', 'Windows Pollution,' or 'preference threshholding'). He seems to have failed to read ""Apples Guide to Human Interface,"" and missed the point of a GUI. He has so many DO's and DON'Ts listed that a programmers DOESN'T know what to do. Although ""Apple's Guide to Human Interface"" is MacCentric, you would be much better off reading it and applying the concepts to your program."
1,disappointing,"After reading all the hype about this book in many publications that should know about this stuff, I bought a copy. This book is highly overrated. I learned absolutely nothing new about designing software. The press passed this guy off as a visionary...I'm sorry, but I just can't agree. He brings nothing visionary to the subject."
2,"Short on concrete, ***********","Its been some time since I read this book, but my lasting impression is that it is not very useful -- it's a 400 page ad for hiring him as a consultant -- based on promises alone.He describes writing a UI design document based, not on roles people play (not directly), but inventing ""real"" people with concrete skills and characteristics, imbedding stock photo in the document to make the ""person"" more real. Good idea to enhance UI Use Case type documents.But the book contains no examples. Only abstract statements. What does a good UI document look like? How detailed should it be?I contacted him via email to obtain so concrete examples. He refused claiming his examples are owned by his clients. I responded suggesting simplification to remove identifying info or he (or I) getting permission from the client for some limited access. No response.Is he for real? Does he have concrete examples? Prove it!! Or is he just blowing smoke."
1,"read Ben Shneiderman, Don Norman & Jakob Nielson, not this.","Cooper kvetches too much. This feels more like an infomercial for the Cooper Interface Development Methodology Kit. Bletch! Stick with the solid material presented by Shneiderman, Norman, Neilson and other respected scientists of their ilk instead of wasting your time with this."
2,"Difficult to read, not much positive","The author spends an enormous amount of time criticizing all GUI designs, bascially calling them all bad. He uses words like 'stupid', 'idiocy', 'dunderhead', 'idiots' and other colorful metaphors. He spends 80% of the text complaining a criticizing, but falls short of offering constructive criticism or recommended alternatives. The book read like a long venting of his personal views. This is not what I was looking for, and I'm going to toss it."
3,needs a good editor,"Cooper offers some good thought provoking ideas, but at times he too long winded. With a good editor this book could have been half the length and twice as good.If you are looking for a book on coding user interfaces then try ""Constructing the user interface"" by Ian Horrocks."
3,A collection of (not so new) ideas...,"Actually I was looking for a book to create a user interface under Windows, when I found this in Amazon.com's review several months ago. Alas, what I got is not a ""technical how-to"" book, but a ""conceptual"" textbook about user interface under Windows. Indeed, some of the author's idea is original & interesting, but most of it is not new. I can barely finish this one, because I can only gain a little from it. But if you happened to teach a ""Windows user-interface overview"" class, maybe you can appreciate this book more than me."
2,More is less,"About Face is largely a rant about examples of ineffective user interface design, with regular breaks along the way to expound upon some ""golden rules"" of user interface design. There's plenty here that's worthwile -- such as as hisarguments against the notions of ""metephor is good"" and ""modal is bad"" -- but it is spoilt by his poor writing style. Whereas Edward Tufte can concisely illuminate just the important elements, Cooper will labour for page after page over trivial points and then insist on trying to summate more complex interactions and subtle distinctions with clunky and trite generalisations. The examples and analogies are regularly unconvincing and sometime completely incorrect, such as when he tries to tell us the telephone was invented for business use. At nearly 600 pages, it's delivery ironicly echos one of its central points about user interfaces: more is less"
3,Same old tough guy talk,"If you like formulaic tough guy talk common to old time wrasslers of the""I was always the straightest talking, toughest guy in the room, who never lost a fight"" vein this book is for you.Although one must admire OLE'S honesty in admitting that he was never in the same class as the likes of Thesz and the old shooters as far as wrestling was concerned. Anderson's description of how new wrestling prospects were treated is chilling in its brutality. Opens your eyes to another side of the wrasslin business that's for sure.Worth the buy if you are interested in one person and one person only's viewpoint with no room for alernative opinions or reasoned analysis. Then again it is a book about OLE ANDERSON and apparently that is him, so as an autobiogrpahy it serves it's purpose. Worth the buy but not in the same class as top flight wrestling books like ""Hooker"" and ""Wrestlers are like Seagulls"" in my opinion."
2,Good Stories but Sour Grapes,"An interesting book, I loved Ole as one of the Four Horsemen, but to hear him denigrate Flair's wrestling skills taxed credulity.If you've just seen Flair in WWE nowdays, you can be excused for buying Anderson's comments, but when you look at his classic matches with Ricky Steamboat, or Terry Funk (or Sting, back in the NWA days) you see a guy who could match (and exceed) each of these guys hold-for-hold. There are very few wrestlers nowdays (basically four: A.J. Styles, Shawn Michaels, Kurt ANgle and Chris Benoit) who could even hold their own with prime Flair.Most of the rest are all products of Vince McMahon's sad circus that he passes off as Wrestling."
3,Ole Anderson Trying to Convince Us of His Place in Wrestling History.,"Overall the book is good. But, I have several problems with it. The overall theme seems not to be how the corporate world ruined professional wrestling but rather Ole trying to convince the reader of his rightful place in wrestling history.This is evidenced by a lot of honest and not so honest self evaluations. Reading between the lines he seems to be much higher of his booking ability than his wrestling ability and I would agree. A lot of the points he makes are often repeated to the point of redundancy. He is correct in how corporate America ruined professional. It is painful to hear how people who knew nothing about professional wrestling were given the authority to split from the NWA leaving it a shell of it's former self then run WCW into the ground. Overall this book was worth reading but not good enough to keep in my collection."
2,A book about how the past was so much better than today,"I used to admire Ole; however after reading these ramblings you can only feel sorry for him. This is really a case of some one who believes the world was better when we had ink pots and quills, rather than email, that the pneumatic tyre should not have replaced the steel rim.Ole, repeats and repeats him, stories are disjointed and jump over the time span time and time again. You get the feel for the book after the first third, the rest just keeps repeating. I read this straight after Terry Funks Biography ""More than hard core"" which a well constructed read was in chronological order.There is a lot of wrestleing history here, but i suspect it may be a little biased"
2,"Confusing Book, Poorly Written","This is the kind of book that gives you a ton of useless classes to install on your system, along with about 50 pages of how to install the ... on your computer. If you don't watch it or read the fine print, one of the IDE's that the accompanying cd installs, will go and screw up your classpath during its install. The simple installing procedure to install some jar files is so complicated that you will spend a half a day getting it installed. And once it is installed the docs, make it impossible to generate the docs you need to use the stuff.From the beginning of the book, there is no smooth transition about how to use java, it just jumps all over the place. The examples you are suposed to do in chapter 2, ask you to do IO things which aren't even covered until chapter 8....? Why do people do that?The writer of the book did not take the end-user into account, but just wrote to get the job done.It is a terrible book."
1,Avoid if you actually want to learn something,"If your aim is to actually learn to code java avoid this book. The book is needlessly complicated and long winded, managing to confuse you even with simple concepts, let alone complicated ones. I was forced to look up concepts the book was trying to explain on the internet and would never have understood any of them if my only resource was this book. Another thing, there are also no answers for end of chapter questions, making working them out a futile effort.The only reason I used, or tried to use, this book was because it was part of the syllabus for an advanced java module. I ended up using the SCJP book by Kathy Sierra which was much more clear and to the point(it covers most of the material in this book). As another reviewer correctly pointed out, this book will make you hate Java. Avoid, especially since there are much better alternatives out there."
4,A fine Biography,"Samuel Zaffiri has produced a good biography of General William Westmoreland. The book begins with some family history tracing the clan's roots back to England, then describes Westmoreland's life from his early upbring, through his Army career, and to his legal battle with CBS news. Unlike more recent biographies of the man who commanded U.S. forces in Vietnam between 1964 and 1968, this book, while not uncritical, presents a balanced and objective image of its subject. What results is a fair portrait, rather than the grotesque characature that one finds all to often in popular literature. It is a good corrective to that mistaken image. First published in 1994, as of this writing (May 2012) it remains the best of the Westmoreland biographies."
3,Nice Lights,Easy set up and up and running in no time as long as they are exposed to direct sunlight to charge up thier batteries.....a little disappointed with the longetivity during a night cycle and do not mistake them for a light to illuminate very much as they are more for decoration
2,Look better than they work,"They just never seemed to charge up fully. The LED in each lamp, yes there's only one LED in each lamp, only worked for about 2 hours after the sun went down. They didn't cast enough light to light the footpath either. 2 stars because of the attractive design, they look good in the daytime."
1,"Short-lived, minimal lighting","We loved the look of these lights and really wanted them to work - but we bought twelve of them and they often did not light up at all, and the light they did provide was minimal. We noticed that they were actually trying to turn on around 4pm when it was still light out (poor design) and therefore, by the time it was dark enough out to want to see them, they had used most of their charge and usually only stayed on for about 1 hour after it was dark (if they had received a full charge in bright sun).After one year, we gave up on these Malibu lights and bought the Target brand solar lights that looked the most similar - which put out brighter light, stay on much longer, light up even on foggy days, and are only about $34 for FOUR lights. My parents and two sets of friends have had the Target solar lights (I think they're manufactured by Brinkman) for over two years and are thrilled with them."
5,Absolute Necessity for Flying,"I agree whole-heartedly with the previous reviewer. I fly often for business and to visit family. Before EarPlanes it was not uncommon for me to be in tears from the pain of pressure changes on take-off, landing and even in-flight. No more! I usually leave the EarPlanes in throughout the flight if the duration is less than 4 hours. They protect against sudden changes due to turbulence or the pilot changing altitudes. I also love the decreased noise since the engines can be quite loud. I have recently flown a number of times with my infant son and I have no trouble interacting with him or recognizing his needs. (I was a little worried about that due to the noise reduction.) Finally, this price is absolutely the best one I have ever seen for this product and well-worth it!"
5,Comfort Flying with EarPlanes EarPlugs,"I am a long time user of EarPlanes Ear Plugs. Whenever someone complains of ear problems I tell them how this product alleviates any discomfort with flying during takeoff and landings. The length of earplanes is just right and keeps them in place. They fit comfortably and can be carried in small carrying case provided with order of three or more. I just had two friends return from airline travel after following my recommendation to use earplanes. Each said they do work and made a difference in their flight comfort. You bet, they as well as me will continue using them."
2,Not Comfortable,They hurt your ears after you wear them for a while. They also don't block alot of sound.
4,"Generally good coverage of the subject, some problems.","I was impressed by the book. It's coverage of each plane chosen by the editor was detailed and thorough. However, the dust cover and the table of contents were misleading. Specifically, the illustration of the Lockheed P-38 and the listing of the P-38 and the Grumman F4F in the table of contents misled me into thinking that the book covered those planes. In the text, the Gloster Meteor was covered and there were two articles about the Messerschmitt 110. The second of these covered it as a night fighter, but there was some coverage of it as a night fighter in the first article. These two replaced the P-38 and F4F. I felt that this tarnished the image of what was otherwise a very fine book."
5,Extraordinary book,"In Mornings on Horseback, David McCullough tells the life story of Theodore Roosevelt from birth to about the age of 30, when he married his second wife. As in McCullough's other books the writing style and narrative are just great. This book is a true page-turner. As the title suggests, McCullough puts a lot of emphasis on Roosevelt's family that made him the man he was. This adds a whole new way to understand the true Roosevelt. Highly recommended!"
5,How can you get better history on Teddy!,I can't imagine a book written by David McCullough that isn't a five-star rating! This Pulitzer Prize historian always promises a great read that makes you long for more! I am always sad when the books end and this book did not disappoint! Teddy came to life for me in this book in a way that surprised me. The flow of the story kept me turning the pages and the only problem I had was getting anything done until this book came to an end. I would recommend this book to any history buff who wants an entertaining and informative read.
2,"Poorly Edited, to Say the Least","The book itself is fine. The product is barely acceptable. The text is full of typos and misspellings. Most apostrophes were omitted; the few used were often wrong. The photos were at the end rather than part of the text, as in a ""real"" copy of the book. The photos were very hazy, unclear, and small.I am very disappointed in Kindle: much too expensive for this low quality product!"
2,disappointed,i usually love David McCullogh and this book was disappointing. i have 1776 and John Adams and i thought that this would be great as well. i just ordered Truman from you and i hope that falls into the great category again.
4,Mornings on Horseback,"I enjoyed the book but was disappointed when I found 30 percent of the book was footnotes. I took it with me to read while I waited for an event and it ended except for footnotes,"
4,Mornings on Horseback,"Takes a while to read. lots of information. long sentences and lots of pronouns. But, a well written and interesting book."
5,Great read,Great read. Arrived promptly.( Mornings on Horseback) Learned a lot about Roosevelt I didn't know. would use buyer again. Thanks
3,TR,"did enjoy the history ..however did not appreciate the authors style, found it boring at times and really had to plug on"
1,Content of book was great - Amazon delivery was horrible,"I purchased the book and got through the first couple of chapters. Then there was an ""error"" and I could not finish. After more than 30 minutes with Amazon - they could not fix the problem and credited my credit card - telling to purchase it again. I did so the same thing happened, another 45 minutes on the phone trying to correct it. Still did not work. Amazon said it's a problem with the owner. I say, if it doesn't work Amazon should not have it available for sale. Get it fixed!"
3,"All about Teddy Roosevelt, except the intersting stuff","While the book was well written and contained a lot of interesting information, it focused on the life of Teddy Roosevelt before he became president, led soldiers in the war, and didn't do anything all that significant. This book focuses on his early life, his family life, and other similar stuff. While this information does give more insight into the man who became governor of New York, vice president and then president, it doesn't talk about that stuff at all. In my opinion, McCullough could have cut this book in half and discussed more about Roosevelts later years. I will concede that McCullough did say in the prolouge his reasoning as to why he only focused on the early years."
3,Excellent book - excellent condition,At first this book was very dull for me (and my husband). But as it went along we both enjoyed it so much. What a remarkable family!!!! Now we want to read more about Roosevelt - his presidency and then his later years. David McCullough did his usual very wonderful job of researching and then weaving it into an excellent tale.
5,Excellent Audio Version,"The two readers for this meticulously researched biography of Theodore Roosevelt add appeal, especially when reading the parts with the southern lady or Irish accents. Well done!"
3,Annoying underlined words ..distracting,"This is a well written book. I found it VERY DISTRACTING that there were (what appeared to me) to be random words and phrases underlined in the text. Not notes. Just random words. I talked to someone in Kindle Help, and she said that these underlined words were supposed to be that way, published that way. I now wish that I purchased a paper copy of the book, presuming that these lines are not in that formatt"
3,Informative but a little slow,"I thought this was a great book, but it did seem a little slow. I also did not like how the performance switched between a man and woman. All-in-all, it was wonderful to learn more about this interesting man."
2,Buffonery,"Historical events are written with the biased view of the author. TR's forage into San Juan Hill in Cuba was a comical massacre understood by historians in other countries. Upon arriving in Cuba with his Roughriders, TR was in need of a publicity stunt for future political gains. When he arrived at San Juan Hill, the fort had been abandoned by the retreating Spanish army and the only personnel were several dozen wounded soldiers, a team of doctors and nurses and three teenage cadets.TR ordered the attack on this defenseless fort and upon entering ordered the bayoneting of all in the fort. The conquering hero then raised the stars and stripes to the cheer of his men before the press cameras. Was this the first ""mi-lai"" massacre?"
3,Mornings on Horseback,"Many people will immensely like this description of Teddy Roosevelt's life. My only criticism is that the events are so detailed. I would rather have had more interpretation of his effect on future national life. This is only My opinion, however."
1,David McCullough makes Teddy Roosevelt dull,David McCullough makes Teddy Roosevelt a very dull character and this book is very slow. I stopped reading half was through.I am a big fan of David's but this book is a stinker.
2,Good book on boring subject,"Why McCullough chose to write a book on such an unpromising subject - Roosevelt's childhood and early years - is a great mystery. There is very little of interest in the childhood years and that part of the book is mercilessly padded out with endless descriptions of houses, furnishings and distant relatives. It is much more interesting when we get to Roosevelt's political career and life in the wild west, but that is a relatively small part of the book. I belong to a book discussion group which had this as a selection, and the members agreed that it could be cut by about 40%-50% with very little loss. In any case it is of interest only to people with an indefatigable hunger for details about Roosevelt."
3,Riding Through Life,"David McCullough wrote a book about Teddy Roosevelt and his family. While most of the story is about Teddy his life is seen as one that takes place in his family. Some of the book is very interestinig. It is easy reading, but long. The idea that asthma is caused by a desire on the part of a child to gain parental attention that is presented as fact iin this book is far outside the general attitudes about asthma today. The fact the Teddy didn't have asthma in Egypt and did have it in the forested parts of Europe should give some evidence that the asthma might have been caused by allergies. Yet, this is not mentioned in the book. Teddy lived a life filled with excitement and action. It was also a life toughed by tragedy. People who like biographies might like this book."
5,From an obsessive reader of TR's life,"Forget ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt"" or any book of young TR by Hermann Hagedorn. This is the most incisive, well-balanced account of that magical, brilliant, loving Knickerbocker family of Union Square. The accounts of the trips the large family took to Europe and to Egypt are engrossing. ""Great Heart"" Thee Roosevelt stood above all others in his class, and it's no wonder that flags throughout NYC flew at half-staff after its citizens learned of his death. McCullough also brings to life the especial closeness of ""Teedie and Edie"" that would link them from their cradles to their graves, even with Alice Lee detouring that relationship for a few years.My admiration of our 26th president has only grown since devouring ""Mornings"". We shall never see another man to match the ""fire of life"" of ""Teedie"" from Union Square and Oyster Bay."
4,Abrupt End,"I've enjoyed other books by McCullough but was disappointed in this one. Just after describing TR's engagement announcement, McCullough abruptly ended the book. A brief ""Afterword"" describes what happened to the main characters.However my curiosity about TR's presidency, his second marriage, his daughter Alice's lilfe and so on remains unsatisfied.I got the feeling McC wasn't overly fond of TR and perhaps that's why he abandoned the project of writing his bio."
5,Excellent read!!,Outstanding job weaving historical facts and scholarly research into a work that is easily read and enjoyed by even the historical novice! Thanks again Mr. McC!!!!
4,Teddy,"It is refreshing to read the story of someone's life and not have it end with their death. Reading about Teddy's asthma and how he managed to rise above the condition offers hope to other young asthma sufferers and the story is a ""good read."""
5,Fun reading,"This is a great book, I enjoyed it, I could not put it down once I started. I will read more that McCullough has written"
4,"Pretty good, but not great","Having read a few of the Author's other books (and I plan to read more based on word of mouth), I can say without a doubt that he is a absolutley fantastic historian and manages to make history come to life.This said, I was a bit surprised on how much detail went into the early life and how little went into his later life. It almost seems like he was writing, decided he had written enough and tries to summarize the last 30 years of his life onto the last chapter. Regardless, the book paints a vivid tale of the life and events of the time and the remarkable person that was Theodore Roosevelt. We'll never have another president like him, no there will never be another person quite like him."
2,Title hardly represents the story,"I found this book spending way too much time on his life and family in NYC, Harvard, and travels abroad as a child, and not nearly enough time on his life spent in ND as the title and back cover summary suggested. I felt deceived in the end. I struggled through it, although finding it boring, and I had hoped it would eventually turn the corner and focus on that period in his life out West. Only the last couple chapters had anything to do with spending any ""mornings on horseback"" and I almost put it back on the shelf in disappointment before I got even close to those chapters. His other book '1776' was much much better."
2,Teddy Roosevelt,"This book given to my brother, a history buff, who did not like it. He raved about 1776 by the same author."
2,Hard to get through,"As a fan of McCullough's works, I bought this book hoping to enjoy it, but quickly became bogged down, reading about the details of the lives of aristocratic victorian families whose self-absorbed lives I just could not make myself care about. After making a valiant effort to read roughly half the book, I found myself skimming over dull material and eventually skipping whole chapters.I don't fault the author, whose biographical skills in his other works are superb, but the Roosevelts, whether Teddy or FDR, and their entourages, were such insufferable snobs that I just couldn't help but not care a whit about any of them."
3,"Good toothbrush holder, but gets dirty easily","It's sturdy, robust, and looks great when clean. Also it fits larger based toothbrushes. Only negative is it gets dirty REAL fast and it's very noticeable. I just throw it into the dishwasher when it does and it comes out sparkling again."
5,Happy grandson,We ordered 3 of these for our 3 grandsons. Had early Christmas with our kids in Dallas and this string was a hit. Our 6 yr old grandson played with this over the high-tech gifts! Boys will be boys and this product gets a boys attention. I am very satisfied with the prompt service and can't wait until our other 2 grandsons get their stretchy string gift.
4,Not bad,"I have used the toy to occupy my hands to help me pay attention. I have let some students use it. It is pretty fun to whack people with, but be careful not to have it come back and whack you instead. It does not have a lot of replay value to it since you can get board of it pretty fast, but I love to use it to keep my hands busy. The price is okay, I would expect this to be more of a 6 dollar or less toy though since there isn't much that goes into the making of it. I would definitely get it if it is on sell for less than 6 dollars."
4,Great fidget toy when silence is important,"Purchased this product for a child with cerebral palsy to play with during church, when silence is desired. Fun product, but it does spring back quickly after being stretched significantly, so be careful to avoid injury (especially if two people are stretching it, and one lets go). Fun to fidget with, though, aside from stretching. And having two colors with high contrast is a bonus: twisting them together, making designs, etc."
4,For Serious PHP4 Developers,"If you are a serious PHP4 developer you will get plenty of long term benefit from this book. The author is really clear with complex topics and his generous samples of code examples are well written. Although the book is 775 pages, the developers guide chapters are all covered in the first 342 pages. There is a 391 page appendix of alphabetically listed and defined PHP functions which can come in handy, a listing of predefined variables and constants, and an appendix on build options. I found the chapters on code reuse and separating html from php quite useful. More database coverage would have been nice, and, like a lot of technical books theses days, I thought it was a little over priced. Overall, this is one of the better books on the subject that is available, and I do highly recommend it."
2,Not much for so many pages,"This book looked great when I flipped through it in the store, but after actually trying to use it it's been a big disappointment. My biggest complaint is the index, which has contained almost nothing I've wanted to look up, i.e. no index entries for ""subroutine"" or ""date"", to name two.What *is* here is well written, clearly by someone who knows what they're talking about, but I generally felt disappointed by each section, as so many topics were presented with such a cursory treatment. This is not the book for someone who wants any depth on any particular aspect of using PHP (databases, sessions, etc).All I have to say is, I'm going to try and exchange this book for another one next week."
1,Not A Very Helpful Guide,"This book is mainly useful for its Function Reference which takes up nearly 400 pages. However, even this Function Reference is not very helpful because of its lack of useful explanations and examples. Several of the PHP related Web Sites have more useful reference sections."
1,poorly done,"This is among the worst computer books I've ever seen. The examples are poor and the explanation of topics could not be worse. Although it is 700 pages half the book is an appendix with a language reference. In the 350 or so pages of text, the topic of reading and writing files with PHP gets 6 pages. I can't emphasize enough how poorly done this book is."
3,Many tips for real life programming,"Actually, this is a good book (not for novice). It covers more advanced topic needed for real life projects. But, I don't like the function reference part (it takes a REALLY lot of pages). I don't think it has any advantages. I hope the publisher will reprint it without the function reference part.Overall: This is a good book."
2,Entertaining as a work of FICTION. Misleading as non-fiction.,"This is a very interesting and entertaining read, but based on conjecture and falsehoods. It is a FICTION novel that has been portrayed as fact. None of this has been proven.The book is actually drawing on a small connection between the Knights Templar and their connection with the Cathars (a dualist religious sect that was annihilated by the Catholic church as heretics). The connection is weak at best.The book should be classified as historical fiction. An average read in that category. But as a supposed non-fiction book it rates only a 1 because it is false.So, average rating, a 2, but that is generous considering the fact that it is really a bunch of lies based on a few facts. I say it often and I will say it again; mixing fact with fiction just makes factual fiction and therefore it is just fiction."
2,SHOULD HAVE RETURNED IT;-(,"I don't care for this one at all and should have returned it, but thought it might be good to keep around for a reference. It serves poorly in this capacity, however, for while considerable information is presented, it is sequestered in so much extraneous verbiage that finding what you are looking for is a chore. Ironically I later went to my local bookstore and procured Elizabeth Castro's Visual Quick Start Guide to keep handy at the desk."
2,Shameful author promotion,"I was suspicious about all of these glowing reviews (strange that they all sound alike and are from ""a reader"") so I decided to look at this book at the library before spending big bucks for it. I'm glad I did. The book is detailed and covers an incredible amount of material but it is too much for most people to follow. I have seen many other books on the market that are easier to follow and are just as detailed. Stanek may know his stuff but his writing falls short. Unless you do web pages for a living, I'd go with another title."
2,Overpriced and lacking in content,"This book tries to cover everything and in doing so, severely limits the amount of information that the reader needs for comprehensive coverage. The book is vastly overpriced and much more detailed information can be found in numerous less pricy books that are out on the market today. I would not recommend this book - it is a waste of money."
1,Proof is in the pudding,"An author writing a book on a particular subject should know his subject, right? In this case, wrong! I went to Mr. Stanek's personal web site and he has white writing on white background! Duh, no thanks."
2,Boo Hiss!!,"IMHO; this book tries to do too much and ends up doing none of it very well. The text will sail over the heads of most beginners while at the same time not deal with advanced topics thoroughly enough to be very useable. If you're a beginner looking to learn the basics, check out Liz Castro's fine work. If you are an advanced user looking for in depth info about topics such as Java Script, VB Script,VRML, etc., get a book targeting your specific needs. This one may wet your whistle, but you'll end up needing to supplement it in the long run. This book would be good if it was the only one of its kind available. But its not, and others are better. Closing comment; to be fair, I should mention that the graphics section is well done"
5,"Very, Very , Very, Good Music !","Ever since I was five, I loved New Age and I still very much do.Especially Cusco. Apurimac 2 _ Return To Ancient America is my favorite album. My two favorite tracks are Montezuma and Yucatan. This is a ticket to a beautiful musical journey when you buy this CD. A true New Age classic indeed. Overall, this, to my opinion, is Cusco's best album yet."
4,"Good, but not great!","Before this album, I had only heard Cusco's ""Water Stories"" and this one definitely was better, yet it didn't hit my musical fibers in the ways that new age acts such as Vangelis or Jean-Michel Jarre have been able to. ""Tula,"" ""Xul-Kan"" and ""Maya Temple"" stand out, with ""Goddess of the Moon"" being the best track in the album. For more 'ancient American'-sounding music, I would recommend listening to Gustavo Santaolalla's 'Ronroco.'"
2,"I say this is the one to buy if U like &#65533;Elevator Music""","If u are an easy going person and love to have something to calm u more ..then buy this one now...I say this is one of the insipid CD I have ever heard, ,,I truly felt as if this is a continues and never ending song...If you like an uplifting CD then you are looking into the wrong CD...To be more objective about this. At first I liked Montezuma but then it turned that the CD is basically 10 different versions of Montezuma If u want a solid and sound advise whether or not to buy the CD ..I say this is the one to buy if U like what they call ""Elevator (left) Music"",,,"
3,It works but is messy,It does work but is messy. If you lay something down first before spraying then it works fine. Shame you can't reposition though.
2,Not suitable for use as a headliner adhesive,"3M 77 spray adhesive was sold to me for use to attach a new headliner in my pickup truck. It was easy to use and seemed to adhere the new headliner quite well. However, within about 2 years the adhesive has failed, and the headliner is again sagging. I suspect it failed due to the heat that can result from the sun on the truck roof. Admittedly, I am located in Hawaii so have a more intense sun than most, but the truck is garaged and only rarely is out in direct sun for hours at a time. Regardless, it proved unsuitable for that use.For less demanding projects where heat is not an issue, this probably is a fine spray adhesive, although it seems a bit expensive for a general purpose adhesive."
3,Gives me a headache!,"We use this product at work. It does a good job of sticking posters to the cardboard backing that we stick them on. However, the chemical smell is pretty strong and gives me a headache if I use the product for more than 10 minutes at a time."
4,Bourbon Street Bistro,Enjoyable walk through the long run of Galatoire's. Recommended for anyone who has eaten there as I have a number of times. You don't need to be a regular to savor the stories. Here's hoping Galatoire's returns even better after Katrina. Steve
4,brings back good memories,"If you are planning a trip to New Orleans, I would recommend eating at Galatoire's. If you have eaten there, this book brings back good memories, even if some of the characters in the book are not familiar. Regarding some of the better-known characters, it's always good to see something of Walker Percy, who enjoyed the restaurant, but I would rather not read anything about Willie Morris, who is also featured in the book."
4,entertaining but not very well written,"I found this book hard going in spots. It repeats itself and bogs down on occasion, and has some timeline issues... All that said however it was a perfect read to bring along on our trip to New Orleans and I really feel like I got an idea about this famous restaurant that I would never have had without reading the book."
4,you will call this book a Bible too!,"'The Bible'!This is how we used to call this book at school! I bought a copy of my own and I can assure you will find any detail you can dream of and answers in any questions or problems that may come up in the workshop. It is really professional and complete. Some reviewers said it sould be revised; I don't exactly disagree but you know silversmithing is such an ancient technique that technology has little affect on it and contemporary investments are still under evaluation. With both black-&-white and colored photos, examples, samples of work and demonstrations by well-known artists this is a unique 'to reffer to' book.The only disadvantage: I don't reccomented it to beginers or you should buy also something easier to read, with less details eg Tim McGreith's 'The complete Metalsmith'.But if you are a professional I cannot imagine how you have survived without Oppi's Bible so far!"
3,The Oppi book (jewelers' bible),"This book is a must for any serious jeweler but unfortunatly the copy i recieved was 99% black and white the original was full of colour and is a much better book for the artistic types However the book i recieved still has all the pictures in B&W and all the technical info which is what i really wanted from the book, if you are considering buying this book i would suggest trying to find the colour version ISBN 0-7091-9616-4"
4,Overview versus Technical Know How,"This is a good book for those wanting a broad overview of all aspects of jewellery making with metals. It contains good illustrations of finished pieces; however, it is not a book that gives step by step instructions. So, if you are looking for a 'how to' book, look elsewhere. Otherwise it is a useful reference but not essential."
3,Informative but...Boring,"I've read a lot of books on Special Ops and especially Lurps in Vietnam. I haven't read a book yet that I didn't like but this one was rather boring. I have to agree with another reviewer that there ""wasn't anything making me want to turn the page."" If you like sit on the edge of your chair, can't put the book down for hours read this isn't it. Still the book is informative and the series is pretty good."
3,Good book with faults.,"Six Silent Men (Book 1) is a good documentary type book on the LRRPs in Vietam. However, it is somewhat unorganized. Further, the writing is not on par with many other books on related subjects. Otherwise, the book is very informative."
5,Great resource,"I found this book to be very helpful. I needed it to help me teach my high school students about the steps for writing research papers, but found myself really enjoying the humor about such a dull subject. It truly was a pleasure to read and, even though I have written many research papers, I found several really insightful ideas that I will incorporate in my next papers. This book really laid out the steps in logical order, explaining each step thoughtfully. It also offered options for accomplishing the same task in different ways, depending on the personality of the user. It may be a bit too advanced for some middle school ages, but was right on the mark for high school and college ages."
2,"Truly for ""dummies"".",This book did not teach anything that someone wouldn't learn in high school or very early in college. Most of it can be found free on grammar websites. It included paragraphs of general knowledge that is better skipped over the read.If you're a sophomore in college or higher don't bother... there is no new information for the advanced student or graduate student.
3,the book is ok,"the book gives great information, but no solid examples for you to go by. it's a great read, but I learn better from seeing what what I am reading. I owuld not buy this book again."
3,Move On,"Most of the information you find in this book is located in at least two other places: the text book required for the class, and other books that cover the topic far better than this one. It might help you write a ""C"" paper, but it will nto help you write and ""A"" paper. I should know. I grade these every day.I only purchased this because I saw it appearing in the halls. It's not that it's wrong, it's incomplete. Not worth the money."
5,A great read!,I found this book in my grandma's bookshelf and fell in love with it!I read it five times and would do it over again. :)
1,INCLUDED WITH SPOTTING SCOPE,This soft case comes with the Leupold spotting scope. I would not purchase this if your buying any of the Leupold Mark 4 spotting scopes.
2,Not that great,"Not able to adjust it to be short enough, and I bought the shorter length too. Heats up and causes sweat under the strap, does not wick any moisture at all, as advertised, but in fact creates heat and moisture. Not sure if it lessens the weight of my Precision bass... sure feels as heavy as it usually is... too bad! Will keep searching for a good bass strap..."
4,Serves the Purpose...,This one was bought along with the Ray35-NT and my friend who uses it say's it is comfortable and serves the purpose. Besides it was affordable.
2,Too Short,"The build quality is good, and the shoulder pad is especially comfortable, but the length of the strap is extremely short. Even at it's longest setting, my bass now sits halfway up my chest, which is not how I like to play. If you like your bass high or are not a big or tall person, it's very comfortable."
5,Awesome!!!,"Simply put, this is one of the most comfortable straps I've ever worn! I personally would highly recommend this strap to gig players and general bass players alike. Hope this helps"
4,Very Comfortable but too short,This strap is ultra comfy but if you prefer your bass in front of your crotch while playing this will not work. Much too short for that. I think it is actually a guitar length and not for bass. Beware.
3,Comfortable but to long...,Its an attractive looking and very well padded strap but it is not for slim or short people. I find this strap ideal for bigger bodies. If your not well over 200 pounds spend money on something that is just as comfortable but not as long.
3,Fun read... don't take it seriously,"This book is not about flying saucers. The flying saucer plot is just the narrative device used by Rucker to allow him to dump from his brain a collection of very imaginative ideas about what technological advances we may make over the next few thousand years. Some of the ideas are actually really clever and interesting... and then, a bit too often, they get really silly and much less believable. But, that is where you have to realize that the book is not to be taken so seriously. If you can do that, you should enjoy the book all the way thru... it's a quick read.I wouldn't recommend this for hard-core sci-fi folk, but rather for the casual sci-fi reader who is looking for something off the wall, and also maybe for someone looking to kick-start their imagination."
4,Wonderful Mix of Bluegrass Songs,"I just received the CD this week and I'm already addicted.The liner notes give an excellent overview of the history of bluegrass, relating the songs on the album to the various stages of the development of the genre."
4,It's Growing On Me...,"I only bought this CD because I'd seen ""Deliverance"" and couldn't get ""Dueling Banjos"" out of my mind. Upon listening to some of the other tracks, though, I found some pretty good stuff. It's different than anything I've ever really been exposed to, but as I get used to the songs, they sound better and better every day..."
5,Appalachian Stomp,"Great music, good pace and rhythm, just like I imagined from listening to the little snippets on y our webiste (what a great service that is!)"
4,Introducing myself to music,"I had no idea about what type of music bluegrass was before I got this CD. Amazon recommended this CD when I used their search function for bluegrass. I don't have anything to compare it against - so I'm judging it on the music and how ""I"" like it as a person who hasn't listened to bluegrass before.Some of the songs do make you want to stomp to the music. If this is a true representation of bluegrass, I don't think I'm a Bluegrass kind of person. But, that's a personal preference. However, some of the songs seem to be ""mood-specific"" in that I seem to like them on a particular time of the day whereas the same song seems a little bit annoying at other times..."
5,A Great Collection of Bluegrass Tunes AAA+++,"Hey bluegrass fans, this is a must have for your music collection. I liked every song on it, in fact every time I play it, I have to go get my mandolin and play along. It's a fun upbeat recording thats guaranteed to make you tap your toe!"
4,great introduction to bluegrass/ trad. country,"The disc was a great purchase for me, I had little experience w/ bluegrass, I have since purchased other Cd's by some of the artists on this. This just barely brushes the surface of what is available, but, hey, it's only one disc! Good jumping off point."
4,Great documentation of Dorothy's life!!!!!,"I totally enjoyed Donald Bogle's biography of Dorothy Dandridge. He really brought to life for me the details of her journey. I found myself absorbed! Not only did I get a good account of Dorothy's life, but also pieces of film history, black and white, so clearly depicted! I'm heading out to get his other books on film history!!!!"
3,Re-edited &contain unexplored aspects of her career.,"Ther was no mention of the revival of ""No Strings"" that she did. No photos of her and her sister as the wonder kids. No information on the whereabouts of her lost film by Ralph Cooper's Million dollar productions called Four Shall Die. No infro on the existing film of the half-completed film Marco Polo."
1,wake me up when I'm done reading,I'm so glad I got this book fr my local library otherwise I would have been highly upset to have spent $$ on it. The 1st 50 pages were so slooooooooow & un-moving that I've returned it to the library FAST. Maybe the movie will be better
3,Paula Dorf Cheek Color Cream,"I wish I would have ordered the powder instead. I don't believe the cream has the ""staying power"" of the powder."
3,Not Enough Spagetti,"I judged by the cover and lost. I was hoping for a fistful of Morricone's spagetti western music. Its there, but not much of it. You are quickly bumped into lesser known, less memorable, less mesmerizing pieces from movies I've never heard of. Once I had an old Victor album that was only tunes from the Sergio/Clint trilogy, rerecorded to appeal more as stand-alone music. I'll hit the flea market this weekend..."
5,"The Book of Life: An Illustrated History of the Evolution of Life on Earth, Second Edition",Excellent book. The evolution of the vertebrates written by the most important investigators. Images and excellent graphics. The chapter about the history of the representations of the extinguished animals is very good
4,"A good synthesis,a bit outdated at times",You would have expected more time and detail to the ermergence of the nervous system and the Cambrian Explosion. A more up-to-date section on human evolution (no mention of Ardipithecus Ramidus) but on the whole the book is a good synthesis of the state of the knowledge in this field.
3,Better try Planter's Club Vol. 1-4,"This Series is really not bad, but once you hear the real deal, it pales a lot.You need to listen to Planter's Club Vol. 1-4 on Amazon.de! This collection from Vienna is a good reason to fly to Austria, like a famous music magazine once wrote..."
2,overhyped and basically useless,"Ok lets get down to why you should save your money and NOT get this book. First of all the author dedicates two or three chapters on WHY chicks should sleep with chicks. Well if your buying this book then I would think that your already curious or interested, correct? Then the author shares some really great ""secrets"" on the where and how to pick up other chicks, let me take the time to write some of them down here for you, first this no brainer, ""Get them intoxicated, and my all time favorite,""take them behind a dumpster and get them to smoke weed"". The author then fills the book up with helpfull hints like, ""go put an ad on the internet"" Dang, I would have never thought of that!! In summary, you can buy this book if you want, but don't expect anything other than common sense stuff, and I use the term VERY lightly!! Thank you for your time."
5,Great book very informative for begiainers,This book was very informative for my g/f to may decissions and answered a lot of her question.Thanks so much
4,Interesting and Entertaining,"This book was hilarious and erotic. If you feel as if it was a bad book or you don't like the topic, perhaps you should read the title. It's a guide to sleeping with chicks, why would u read it if you didn't like chicks or couldn't read it with a light heart? Obviously its not for everyone. I'm not gay or bisexual but I loved the authors candor and truthfulness at approaching this topic. It's a great read and hilarious."
3,Didn't solve the problem...,"I suppose I can't blame the book because it is geared toward straight women and I identify as bi but the book just didn't solve the problem I was having with women. It's a problem that many men and women experience and should have been better addressed: talking to women I am attracted to. It did not cover this at all and that's what I was looking for. The section on flirting was the shortest and most vague of this normally medically precise book. All it really said was, ""Now go flirt with her like you normally do!"" Not helpful...Other than that, this is a great and educational read."
3,The brand is unethical but the product is good,"It is fantastic that this product is well priced for US consumers. In Australia, it is twice the price just reflecting the fact that Weber are rorting Australian consumers. There is no justification for the increase even if you take volume, import duties and Australian legislation into account. Furthermore, they block the sale and export of products even like the covers to the Australian market. I have no time for this type of unethical pricing practice."
1,"Good quality, bad design","!!!DON'T BUY THIS!!!!The design is beyond terrible - which is a shame because the construction is of good quality and price is great ($10).This thing only covers the enamel coated aluminum top of the grill and the plastic carry handles (i.e. the indestructible parts).The burner control valve & knob, the gas hookup connector, spark ignitor with battery - all the VULNERABLE MOVING PARTS THAT CONTROL THE GRILL are left hanging out in the elements (not good here in Michigan).What's the point of a grill cover that only covers the indestructible parts but leaves the fragile pieces hanging out to rot? The logic is backwards.This cover is designed specifically for my Weber Q220 (I didn't buy the wrong one).The cover for the smaller Weber Q100 fits totally around it's grill, controls and all - I wish this one was designed the same.I wouldn't want one of these even for free, you'd be further ahead using a GARBAGE BAG to cover your grill (which is where this cover belongs)!"
3,Vinyl BBQ cover,"This is a really good cover that fits very well. I gave it a lower score because the pull up cords on the front and back were not properly sewn on one end on both the front and back, but the cover still has bungee like tension cord on both ends(sides)that take up the slack quite good. Looks very nice and protects the grill good."
3,Weber Q Cover,Nice heavy fabric that fits pretty well. Has draw cords on front and back that are a little awkward to use and keep snug. Elastic cord around bottom would be better?
3,Should have been thinking a little more clearly,"In the end it all worked out. I originally bought the cover for the Weber Q ELECTRIC grill but failed to think through the ramifications of leaving an electric grill outside and exposed to the elements. Moisture and electric appliances don't mesh all that well for obvious reasons. So now, I bring in the electric grill when not in use and use the cover for my Smokey Joe charcoal mini-grill which actually works quite well.Sure, there's a little less than pleasing overhang when placed on the Smokey but it works."
1,"Rain gets in, doesn't work!","I believe the point of a grill cover is to both protect the device and keep it dry. The one star rating I'm giving this is because, while it does protect it from nature's dry debris, rain water always gets in, and fills up the drip pan, which creates a huge, greasy mess on the table which it sits. I've tried adjusting it different ways, cinching the drawstring, not cinching, but to no avail, water always gets in!"
2,Pretty lame,Flimsy and ill-fitting. The cover manages to be loose and too small for the Q220 at the same time. Hard to see what the point is.
5,My favorite out of the entire collection,I love this CD soooooooo much. It ties the era I grew up to some of the classics my parents listened to. I bought it years ago and it was stolen. I had to buy it again.
4,"Jeremy Brett is Sherlock Holmes, and this is his story","A little dry, but if you are a fan of Jeremy Brett, (The BEST Sherlock Holmes), this is a must read. It is remarkable how Jeremy Brett was able to work through all of the terrible things in his life. Above all, it is heartwarming to see his fellow actors and friends never left his side during his troubles. You just don't here about that sort of thing today."
3,Nice lights! Batteries are weak!!,I do like these lights. They are very attractive and simple to set up and use.The only problem I have had is with the batteries. I have replaced two within the first month. Otherwise they are great. The lights are not very bright if that is what you are looking for. Fine for path lighting.To update my review-I do like the lights but the tops are oxidizing (rusting) so not so good after all!
3,"Pretty, but.........","This pair was very attractive. I purchased them for use at the cemetery but I have some concern that they will be blown from the hook. I think I can replace the plastic cap on the end of the hook to prevent that from happening, though. On a windy day, they swing quite a lot. The bottom of one of the lights slightly bumps the curve of the hook and needed some adjustment. They will probably work fine in a garden setting. I am satisfied, but think the design could have been better."
3,condition of book,The book was somewhat beat up and crumpled. The strangest part about it is that half the pages are white and half the pages are cream colored. I have to assume it was some kind of printing error.
1,"""Playing Roulette As A Business"" ? You will not last long!","""Playing Roulette As A Business"", basically outlines a negative betting progression, similar to martingale type systems. The Author Claims, that his specific wheel number's, when bet in his recommended manner, will outperform actual probability, due to thier positon's on the wheel. If indeed, these numbers did hit as often as the author suggest's, you would not need a betting progression to gain an edge. ""If"" this were the case, these magic numbers could be printed and sold on an index card, and there would be no need to waste an entire book on the subject. That is what this book is an ""Entire Waste""!"
1,Only .01% better than just picking a number! NOT WORTH IT!,"This book makes itself appear to be an all encompassing winning strategy. It is not. I thought this book would have many strategies! All it has is 1 specific idea! And it only works on the double zero wheel! I was very disappointed. I tried out the system of play and it did not even put me ahead. I guess I could have stuck with it and waited to see the long term effect, but the idea in this book is stupid anyway. A person could write down this formula on a cocktail napkin(if he/she wrote very small.)It's based on placing the same bets over and over again, which is dumb because roulette is so unpredictable that you could absolutely never win if unlucky. It also uses progession(adding more $ for each loss), which is usually a bad idea. I really don't recommend spending your hard earned money on this. I think there are many, many better books with better ideas in them that I have read or own."
4,"Brilliant bio, but...","This is a great biography, but I only wish there was a little more about Hopkins actual writings. His poems are so extraordinary, they create nothing but questions in my mind. And I'd love to find a biography that tackles the work as well as the man."
1,don't waste your time or money,"okay, so i'm trying to quit smoking after a pack a day habit... i was doing okay cold turkey but needed something to stop myself from overeating. so i go out and find this product at my local drugstore and immediately try one. not only do they not contain any nicotine or tobacco (which i guess i should have looked for before purchase), but they taste absolutely terrible! they do not taste even remotely like cigarettes.they provide no purpose. don't waste your money. that's what i get for trying to buy cheap products to help quit smoking."
1,Endit-,"I purchased Endit as an aid to help me quit smoking along with some Commit lozenges. The Commit appears to be working very well according to what it says it does, but the Endit smokeless cigarettes....well, the flavor is extremely weak and they do not appear to last as promised. Also they are shaped rather flat, not round like a cigarette. I could have had the same effect with a straw. I have seen other smokeless cigarettes that I feel I should have tried instead. Don't waste your money."
2,Dallas Cowboys Sweatshirt,"Frankly, I was disappointed in the shirt. In retrospect, it was a pricey purchase for a sweatshirt that any T-shirt shop could have produced. To me, it seemed as if the stenciled letters for off center."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I was very disapponted with this product. They only stay lit for a couple of hours & barely at that.
4,Pretty,These lights look pretty. The only bad thing was that they didn't all shine at the same brightness. I bought them as a gift for someone else.
1,Sell your stock in Sony now before it's too late. . . .,"I bought this little recorder based on my past experiences with their products which was fairly good.This is perhaps the worst electonic device ever made, leading me to believe that it was designed and assembled in a third world country by young children working 16 hour shifts.The sound quality is so bad that the mic will not pick up normal conversation such as ""honey, would you get me a beer?"" from over three feet away, even with the mic set on ""sens high""Sony is sure to alienate Mac users everywhere with incompatible software..Don't look for the ICD-P110 Voice recorder in a nationwide street campaign featuring graffiti artists doing paid placements on buildings, which is how Sony has been promoting their playstation lately"
5,Survive Your Cancer Review,I found this book to be well written and chock full of valuable invormation. My hat is off to Barbara for taking the time to help keep others well informed.
4,Together we are stronger,"Battle with cancer is a tough battle. With all due respect for medical practicians, they sometimes do not understand what cancer patients and their close ones feel. Cancer patients are asking for help desperately and they are often afraid of displeasing their doctors - the only ones who can give them hope . Barbara's book helped me with regaining my confidence and maintaining my strength when dealing with my husband's doctors. As soon as I read the book I stopped feeling guilty when requesting test results and asking common sense questions. Barbara's book can provide cancer fighters with that additional support that they need to win their battle."
4,I like this a lot,"This is a small, sharp and useful device. I have purchased a couple of these to keep on my keychains. Given the choice, I find the utility of the Victorinox Rally a lot better. The difference is the scissors are replaced with a bottle opener and slotted screwdriver. I personally find those things more useful, but a well made useful device nonetheless."
3,Flight From Eden (Excellent Novel),"For my money i dont know if i could have read a better book. This book is the best i have read this millenium. Outstanding story line, smooth flow of events and extremely understandable even though this is a technical sci-fi. I am used to reading three or four books at a time and the transition from one to another is a bit choppy, with this book you pick up right where you left off, that is, if you can even put the book down."
1,Awful,"Listening to this album, I kept thinking that I was trapped in a really bad pizza joint where all the waiters had mustaches painted on with eyebrow pencil and tried to sound like Dean Martin acting like a real Italian. Fortunately, I woke up and turned off the CD. This was a total waste of money for me. If you want mine, you can have it for free as long as you come and get it."
5,Wonderful! Fantastic! My favorite!!!,"I have only stopped listening to this CD when I loan it to my sister for a day or two. I absolutely LOVE Patrizio! I saw the PBS show and fell in love with him as soon as I heard him sing ""On An Evening In Roma"" I watched that program for the next week that it was on and it didn't take me long to go out and find the CD. I think that all but maybe two songs aren't memorable. And those two are in Italian (which I don't speak). My absolute favorites are ""Amore Scusami"" and ""Come Prima"". Patrizio is wonderful (and 100% georgeous)! Oh, and I'm only in my early 20's thank you very much!"
2,Canzone Italiani,Having been away from my home country for forty years it is a pleasure to listen to a yound Italian singing a lovely blend of old and new songs. Patrizio's rendision is refreshing and delightful
2,old 40's and 50's italian songs,Patrizio has a pleasant voice but the repertoire in this cd would appeal mostly to the 60 plus.If you are not familiar with Italian music and are looking for a good background to your spaghetti dinner this could be something for you.
5,I have this CD on repeat,"I saw his PBS special and ordered the CD the same night. Very entertaining. IL MUNDO, L'ITALIANO, and Home to Mamma are my new favorites to listen to as I run and workout at the gym. Very powerful songs that just make me want to get off my rear-end and do something, whether it's dancing or working out...these songs inspire me! They may be covers of originals, so what??? He brings his own style and interpretation to them.I attended his concert last night (4/10) at the Chicago Theatre. He was absolutely amazing. Awesome concert, great entertainer, very funny sense of humor. The crowd was on their feet for the entire encore. Matt Dusk was his opening act and he brought him out and they sang ""Just a Gigolo."" They sounded just like Frank and Dean. I would recommended both this CD and his new one, ""Forever Begins Tonight,"" to everybody!"
5,Sophistication Plus!,Patrizio is the embodiment of the true romantic crooner. Listening to this cd will transport you to Italy in a heartbeat. Memorable songs presented by a fantastic performer.
4,His voice,"What a voice he has, I just love it!! AND the songs remind me of Gramma and eating sunday meals with the family."
5,For Music Lovers,"I hope CD's don't wear out from being played over and over because I'm sure giving this one a workout! I really enjoy listening to Patrizio singing these wonderful songs. His voice and style remind me of the wonderful pop singers of the past, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Jerry Vale, etc. Gave this CD to family members for Christmas."
3,An OK book,i thought that this book was an ok book. i didn't like it that much because i kinda got bored with it. some of the good parts were when Frightful caught an animal. it didn't have enough action in it. If you like books that aren't thrilling and and books that are calm then this is your kind of book!! but if you like action and books that make you think than i suggest the Artemis Fowell series!!!
2,Broken when received,"I was so excited to get this trilogy. I read ""My Side of the Mountain"" when I was a child. I wish this version was in three separate books, not one giant book. I was upset because the book was falling apart when I got it in the mail. I ended up sending it back and buying another set."
5,A Classic Story: Boy Leaves & Never Comes Back,"As a boy, I wanted so badly to be Sam Gribley. The idea of walking out of the city and being self sufficient in the woods was enchanting. Now that I have children, I wanted to share this dream with them. Reading the book with/to my 9 year old proved to me that she is not interested in the same things as Dear Old Dad, but it was still a valuable experience. Kids today seem not to think about nature - at all. This was at the least a cause for her to consider nature, and at best a wake-up call that there is life beyond the living room."
2,I'd Call This C-!!!!!,"I would recomend this book to readers looking for light adventure. Though it's an adveture I don't think tht it had as much action as it could have. To reach my ""5"" standard A book must be exiting and thrilling. I enjoy mysteries that keep you on the edge of your seat. On lazy days I enjoy a light reading book such as this, but those days are only the weekends andand thats two sevenths but we won't get into math will we? I think that my younger cousins may like this book, but for older more complicated readers may I suggest White Fang? Still if you want light reading...Here you go!!!~Annabella C.P.S. Sorry if you think that was too much but this isn't my style!"
2,My Review,"I enjoyed reading this book because, Sam, the main character, likes to try new, non-city related, foods, homes, and clothing. Every detail in the story is fully described. When you read the book, you can clearly picture each setting, and you feel like you are there. I would definately recommend this book to a friend! I'm sorry if you don't like my score.~Tiger D. - age 10"
5,Wonderful book -- for kids and adults alike,"This is a wonderful book. It's intention is for a young person, but it has plenty to offer adults as well.The research that went into it (regarding birds) is obvious. It's a story that will captivate any kid.I'm a 56 year old woman and I loved it. It's rather simple in most of the sentence construction, butI didn't dwell on it. The story kept my interest.I think this would be a wonderful learning tool for any kid.The story encompasses many facets:- the kid living totally on his own (with his dad's approval, of course)- the kid learning how to survive- the kid's research into how to make things- the kid's introduction into falconing- nature- relationships with adults- relationship with his sibling- speaking up in the cause for animalsIt's wonderful."
4,OKay,"I think this book would not be good for young children because they might try to be like Sam and run away from home. Besides that it was a very good book and I liked it a lot. I thought that Sam was a very inspiring character, and if someone did try to live off the land they might learn a lot from that book that would be helpful.I would not mind reading that book again at all because it was so good."
5,Gets my imagination flowing!,"In My Side of the Mountain, Sam leaves the city and goes to a forest on a mountain to live off the land. My favorite thing in the book is that he gets a pet falcon named Frightful. What I don't like is that he gets found out. At the end, his family comes to live with him but they don't live in Hemlock trees, they build a house out of wood. I recommend this book highly to all my friends!By Aidan, 8 yrs. old"
3,Unique and good price,"Cool looking doorbell. Button cracked after a year, but the price is good and product is cool. I think I can replace the button if I get highly motivated.... It still works!"
1,very cheap looking,"I bought this a present for my mom and when it arrived I was shocked at how it looked. It looked as though a 5 year old painted it. I know it's ""hand painted"" but is it that hard to stay in the lines? It just looks very cheap and poorly made. It is too expensive for what you get. The only reason I am not returning it is because it doesn't have to go on the outside of my house."
3,Hole problem,"The hole by the head is crooked. The screw does not go in flushed/recesses with the gecko body. Very disappointing. I took to hardware store to see if another screw would work better, but they said it was the hole itself.Everyone who sees it, asks where I got it. It is a hit when you see it. However wish the holes were more true"
3,I see (through) you,I was really looking forward to having this cute little guy crawling up the side of our house but unfortunately the button simply wouldn't stay inside the body. I wish I had seen the other review where the guy had used caulk to hold it together but I also agree you shouldn't have to. The other thing that was no big deal to us since we were painting and patching the exterior of the house anyway was that the screw holes did not line up with the existing ones. Luckily that wasn't the case when we bought a plain old boring one as a replacement.
5,Cool little buzzer,"This is a fun, cool doorbell buzzer. It appears to be well made; it's lighted; comes with two screws. I'm stretching here folks... There's not much else to say!"
2,Never Received The Item,I purchased a bunch of items from Amazon and never received this product. Sort of forgot about the issue until my wife asked me whatever happened to the cool Gecko doorbell button. Amazon's return window has expired so we've sort of written off this one as a loss. I gave the item 2 stars because it seems like a cool product but the lack of it ever arriving doesn't all me to provide any better rating. In general I have had great success with Amazon purchases but I would not do business with this vendor again.
2,"it's pretty, but","This is pretty, but the bottom hole does not align with previous drilled hole for old doorbell cover.It also looks very plastic-like. The colors are great though!"
2,Lizard Bell,Bell looks nice but button comes out when housing is screwed into wall. Had to use caulking to hold button to housing!
5,Gecko Doorbell,Great item! Colorful and bright! Easy to install! Perfect for replacement of those plain metal doorbells! Gives my front entrance a little excitement!
5,Fascinating Support,"As an Elder in the Disciples of Christ denomination, I'm always looking for help in planning my meditations and prayers to be used during our communion and offeratory service. I was offered this book because of my order history at Amazon. It looked promising. I ordered it and just loved it. The opening chapters are filled with denomination background that I knew, but not as in depth. Very interesting. The introduction is wonderful and each and every meditation offered is wonderful. I only wish they had offered more every day type prayers for communion. There is one for almost every church holiday you could think of. I liked the book so much I just received the second one as a gift to my cousin. If you are a Disciples Elder you will surely use and enjoy this book very much."
5,"Like New Orleans-greasy, tasty and habit-forming","If you've never heard New Orleans funk, start here. This stuff was years ahead of the commercial ""funk"" of the seventies, and still sounds great. Allen Toussaint's horn arrangements phatten up the incredibly tight (loose?) groove. One and two chord jams never sounded so good."
5,The definitive evidence of funk evolution is right here,"What can you say? The Meters are it. There is no musician on the planet who can lay claim to being ""funky"" without acknowledging the influence of this here band, period. While the band still performs today, it is not the same band featured in the anthology - the new live band only contains 2 of the original members (George Porter, Jr. and Art Neville). So don't expect to see the live version of the Meters match the electricity captured on this incredible boxed set."
5,Good Value,"For the price I enjoy these speakers very much so. I use them on a PC despite JBL's association with Apple, but I found them very easy to set up and once set up they have a terrific sound, very clear and good bass response. I bought them mainly for the purpose of listening to my large music library and for that they have been wonderful.I see the reviews where people had problems with these speakers and the lack of customer service, and maybe I was lucky, but I have not experienced any problems and I would recommend them to someone who wants good sound for their computer but is on a budget."
1,DON'T BE SO QUICKEE TO BUY ! JUNK !!!,I purchased this mop at my local Home Depot which had a rather large selection. I remembered the name Quickee once represented decent quality so I wasn't too put off by the price which was higher than the rest of the selections. Once I tried the mop I found that the hand wringer on the handle would loosely flop against the handle making an annoying clapping sound. The wringer itself is a push rather than a pull which is awkward and the mop would wring itself while in use. The mop head is large but even this was a negative when working with an average size bucket because it was tough to wring excess water into the bucket without making a mess. Really flimsey and poor quality. ZERO STARS !!!
4,"Excellent Sponge Mop, Once Modified","Durable sponge, easy to wring out, sanitize and replace when worn out. Mop head fits easily under kitchen and bathroom cabinet kickboards. Beware the red scrubber pad, it will leave pink streaks in a light colored floor, even if you are only mopping with cold water. The pink streaks in my linoleum have kept their brightness for 7 years. You can pop off the scrubber without harming the mop. Do not leave the mop resting on the sponge, or it will permanently deform."
4,first SVT book I ever read,"This was the first Sweet Valley Twins book I ever read. I found it in a thrift store when I was 12. It hooked me, I had to check the library constantly and every garage sale I saw...I ended up reading nearly all of them. Sadly, I've lost/given away my collection through the years."
1,"Terrible, Nasty, Horrible, COME ON, MS. PASCAL!","This book was very terrible. I suggest that you not read it. If you want to know what it is about, very, very, very, very, very badly, read it, but you will be very, very, very, very,very disappointed."
4,Carl Rogers meets the Buddha,"I highly recommend this book for anyone who practices psychotherapy and who truly wants to be 'engaged' in a genuine process with their clients. Zen and the Heart of Psychotherapy uncovers a process of mutual growth and transformation that can occur for both the client AND the therapist using basic Zen principles and ideas. This book does not get encumbered in Eastern ambiguity or unnecessary and technical Buddhist semantics. Regardless of your or your client's spiritual belief system, the ideas presented can be considered universally and are useful in not only forging a strong therapeutic alliance in the here and now, but also for faciliating growth, transformation and healing of mind, body and spirit."
3,Coolpix help,Not as helpful as I expected. Too much info and title should spell out what particular Coolpix(s) it describes.
2,THEY ITCH....,"I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY WIFE DUE TO MY SNORING. SHE SAYS THEY ITCH HER, THUS MAKING THEM UNCOMFORTABLE. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND, SHE HAS FOUND SOMETHING WRONG WITH EVERY PAIR OF PLUGS I'VE GOTTEN HER, SO THIS MAY NOT BE A FAIR EVALUATION."
3,The CD is an impostor of their original recording on tape...,The first time I heard 1000 Nights was on tape sold in a Persian store when the group was unheard of. Even the cover design on tape is different. The arrangement on the cassette on 1000 Nights is musically better than the CD release. I thought I bought the same exact arrangement when I bought the CD. The tempo on the tape is more fluid and a beat faster. The CD has choppy arrangement as though the artists struggled to include more percussion and otherwise unnecessary distracting instruments white the tempo drags... What a letdown!
5,Beautiful music,"I have been to the Greek Islands and everytime I put this CD in it puts me back in that place and I just dream I am on a beach in the Mediterranean somewhere peaceful. This music is absolutely beautiful and yes I do agree with the one reviewer who said this is romantic music also, perfect ""mood"" music if you know what I mean. Enjoy!"
3,Eh...,"It's an okay CD... very calming music.Great for when you're in a very mellow, chilled out mood."
4,reasons to buy the Pomus tribute,"Los Lobos bluesy ""Lonely Avenue"" and Bob Dylan's rocking ""Boogie Woogie Country Girl"" get this tribute off to a flying start. But it gets better from there. There are two standout R&B tracks: a stem-winding ""Must be a Better World Somewhere"" from Irma Thomas and a sophisticated ""Still in Love with You"" from the rarely heard Solomon Burke. Dion's ""Turn Me Loose"" is also very strong. B.B. King, Shawn Colvin, and Roseanne Cash also deliver some fine performances. There's really no bad track. Highly recommended."
4,Viva Doc,"Shawn Colvin brings meanings and nuances out of Viva Las Vegas maybe not intend by the Doc, but this is a great version. Got a good song? Need a good singer? Call Aaron Neville. What a voice, this ranks with his work on In The Still Of The Night from the Red Hot And Blue benefit album of a few years back.This cd tribute is uniformly good from start to finish, and it seems unfair not to mention everyone taking part, but I'll just end with a recommendation to check out John Hiatt and his most excellent band chewing their way through Mess Of The Blues."
5,Viva Shawn Colvin,"Must beg to differ with the review of this CD. Shawn Colvin's version of Viva Las Vegas is the tops, and this dude abides. The Doc Pomus tribute CD should be more readibly available."
1,Wrong item received,"I have never had problems with orders i have placed at amazon, but this was the first time. I order this ati radeon 9200 video card but i received a dds tape instead. Ritz camera was the one who sold this producto, and the had in their databases that i placed the order for a dds tape. It take about four weeks to receive a refund. I will continue buying at amazon, but i will never placed an order again from ritzcamera"
5,SUPER GRAPHICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,WHEN I INSTALLED THIS VIDEO CARD IN MY DELL COMPUTER IT BLEW ME AWAY!!!!!!! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS CARD TO ANYONE WHO IS A GAMER. WOW!!!!!
3,"Good, but Not Good Enough","When I first got this card I was blown away by it's power, price, and graphics. However there is a catch. Many new games require different cards, and do not support the 9200. I have now found 3 games that work on almost every ATI Radeon card (9000 and up) except this one. I now have to buy another card to support those games (Splinter Cell, Lord of the Rings, and The Matrix). If you are a serious PC gamer DO NOT BUY THIS CARD. However if you don't play to many high end games this card is good for you.Ok, enough about games. This card is pretty good when it comes to overall display. The one thing missing is that it doesn't have a digital monitor jack, so you wouldn't be able to experiance the best display of your new $500 flat-screen monitor. Hope this review helps you! :)"
1,appalling,"the worst graphics card ive owned or come across in terms of reliability. ive had this in my P4 machine since new (a long 2 years) and it crashes all the time due to overheating and othertimes dues to running programmes (not games) it just cant handle (ie memory map 3d map viewer, cubase, ableton live, often just webpages).ive put a passive cooler on it and still about 3 or 4 times a week it just restarts the pc for no apparent reason. occasionally the pc has to be left off overnight to let it cooldown enough as it wont boot up at all after some crashes. finally im getting rid of this junk. avoid at all costs."
3,"ATI Technologies Radeon 9200 128MB, do not expect your doors blown off","Handles a lot of video, but still can get choppy/stutter on rollercoasters and flight simulation. Did buy at a good price though. You get what you pay for."
5,Not the Sarah You're Used To,"I love Cradle of Filth and Sarah's contribution to their sound. However, if you're expecting to hear the same Sarah Deva on this album as the one you're used to hearing with CoF, you're going to be surprised. Being the frontwoman instead of hired help permits her to shine in ways that she never could with Cradle. This album forgos the frenetic stylings of Cradle in favor of the more relaxing styles of Within Temptation and Leaves' Eyes. Musically and technically this album was very well thought out and executed from start to finish.This album was probably the best investment in music I've made this year.Favorite tracks:Six Feet Under's Not Deep EnoughHell Hath No Fury Like a Woman Scorned"
2,One hit wonder band,The album is so; so at best. Only one true great song on this album: Confined in me. The rest are dull echos of this song. So promising and then vanish in a puff of smoke.
1,this music cd sucks,"The cd has only two songs to do with the show. The other 10 are not related. The cd was poor and was unnecesary. I did not like that cd one bit! If you want some good advice, don't get it!!!!!!"
4,Great CD!,"If you are like me and still watch Saved By the Bell before you go to work in the morning, you will love this cd! It has great songs from when the gang formed their own rock group and from Hot Sundae, the girls' group! This CD is great!"
1,WRONG ISBN,The book that was sent has the same title but does not have a matching isbn to what was searched. The edition number is wrong and the book is an international edition(wrong units for U.S.). It is a shame that students are continually being ripped off.
3,Very interesting read!,"I am currently taking an introductory course in thermodynamics. I find this book to be a very interesting read. The book uses both SI units and Imperial units, which at times seem very confusing. There is a lot of information on this book, thus this book is a good starting point to learn about thermodynamics."
4,Entertaining,"I'd like the premise, and the heroine Jane Nichols. Although not the best thriller I've read, it kept my interest.I am definitely going to read the sequel!"
5,WOW! Can't wait for more Jane! Out cools Kinsey.,Out cools Kinsey. Has less problems than Dr. Kay and is every bit as tough as Hammer! Gimme MORE!!
2,Disappointing.,"I just couldn't like Jane Nichols, the heroine of this book. She's supposed to be this terrific secret agent, so why is her mentor, Mac, always rescuing her? She's tormented by the death of her former lover for years. Nightmares, cold sweats, you name it, we hear about it in detail.If the heroine had just taken herself a little less seriously maybe I'd have liked it. As it is, I'll stick to my Kinsey Millhone mysteries for a smart, tough cookie who also has a great sense of humor and isn't mired down with all this angst."
5,What a great book!,"I just finished reading AKA Jane and boy, what a great book! I can't wait to see where Maureen Tan takes Jane. Parts of this book remind me of the Deighton series of books (Game/Set/Match, etc.) and parts remind me of characters like Stephanie Plum and Sharon McCone.This book is a cross between a stiff British espionage story and a modern strong female protagonist story.A wonderful book - highly recommended!"
5,Exhausted from reading all night,"It was so difficult to put this book down that I ended up reading through the night. It was a true delight to finally read a book that was'nt ""Cheesy"", but actually had a plot. Thank You Ms. Tan for finally giving us a book that I not only enjoy but truly am looking foward to a sequel!"
5,Warm & Lively Mozart Playing,"After doing some research and reading tons of reviews I have finally purchased this set of Mozart Piano Sonatas. This is also my first recording of Maria-Joo Pires. The first song I played on the CD player is No.10 in C major K330. I have heard other versions before (Horowitz, Barenboim etc) and I found Pires has rich and warm tone which makes Mozart so approachable and adorable. Lots of contrasts in colour and in dynamics. She plays with spirit and awesome clarity, a wonderful Mozart interpreter. The sound/recording quality is also superb. I am glad I got this set. Highly recommended."
2,Of no use,"If you want to learn basic Greek don't waste your time with this. There are no grammar explanations, but just some helter-skelter comments. You are not going to learn Greek, or any other language for that matter, without at least some systematic explanation of grammar. Don't be fooled by the Teach Yourself Beginner's series. They are not mcuh more than phrase books and will not prepare you for the situations you will encounter when conversing with natives. It is nuch better to go right to a self-study course which is more in-depth. This book trys to make lazy people think they are really going to learn something. If you want something fast and not so ""in depth"" get ""Conversational Greek in 7 Days"", it is much, much better."
5,They love it!,"Both my younger cat (<1 year old) and my large dog love this toy. They will sit on opposite sides of it and push the ball to each other. My two older cats (16 years old and 3 years old) pretty much ignore the ball and just enjoy the cardboard scratcher part.The cardboard insert can be flipped over and the other side used before needing to completely replace it.I like the fact that replacement cardboard scratchers and replacement balls can be easily obtained through both local shops and online.I purchased this after seeing my mom's cat (7 years old) playing with it. Apparently it appeals to cats of every age, but I would think kittens would find it most entertaining."
4,Great cat toy!,My 1 year old Siberian loves the StarChaser. My furniture loves the place on it for him to sharpen his claws!
2,"She can sing, but she can't pick good songs","This album and the last have been disappointing. There are always highlights (Not While I'm Around, this time out) but there is always so much trite drivel and boring, boring, boring production. I'm not surprised she doesn't have a record deal in the U.S. I am surprised that such a gifted singer chooses such trash to waste her pipes on. This is rough, I know, but she's got so much to offer that she should be putting out something better."
1,Sheena should retire,I wonder how she had time to make this cd with here bodyblade commercials. Her musics hasnt been the same since his left babyface
3,Something Good,"It's been long enough since Sheena Easton put out a record that has as much to offer as ""Home"" does. Each of the ten tracks here are a revelation. That's not to say that the album is entirely a success on its own. ""Our House"" is as bland as a pop song can get and ""My Treasure Is You"" is Sheena's attempt at replicating Britney Spears' success. There is also one too many remakes on the CD, which takes away from the freshness of the entire project. Particulary irksome is the unecessary reworking of ""Never Saw A Miracle.""But even with all of its weaknesses, ""Home"" is still a showcase for an exceptional voice who now values the art of making music over the business of marketing it."
4,Sheena shows us she's still around with great new songs,"I actually found the CD by surprise looking for the reissue (1st US pressing) of NO SOUND BUT A HEART. Compared to FREEDOM, this new album tops it. This is the Sheena sound I like, more to like her early 80's beginnings. CARRY A DREAM is a beautiful ballad and is a major stand out. My album favorite is MY TREASURE IS YOU, a great pop dance number. If this album does not get her a new US label, then something is wrong with the US music business."
2,Not dishwasher safe,"I'd been looking for one of these for a long time.. they are apparently a ""bar"" item, and not a kitchen item. The yellow enamel chips off in the dishwasher. The size of lemon/lime slice that can be put in the squeezer is much smaller than one I had many years ago. It tends to flip the slice on its side, rather than keeping the juice side down. Basically disappointed."
1,disappointed,"The text of the so-called article is also the same as written in the editorial review. No further information on the project is given in the ""article"". The rest of the document is just like a telephone directory of the organization. I wouldn't recommend it to any other people unless s/he is looking for the telephone number of the personnel in that organization."
5,"Excellent, presents the gifts of each type.","Very good book. It presents what are each type gifts, and how to use them to go towards more consciouness, towards enlightenment.The book contains a panel of people of each types answering two questions, it has helped me deepening my understanding of each type."
5,Tommy Bolin Magic,"lets face it,anything Purple officially relesed live with This line was rubbish. I had previously bought ""on the wings Of a russian Foxbat"" and thought that was good-alas this is 10 times better, the recording is clear and Bolins playing is on. The version of wild Dogs for all you teaser fans is amazing,such is You keep on moving and Owe to G. So far the best live recording Of this particular line up of deep Purple. A must for tommy bolin fans everywhere, quite simply for wild dogs alone. And for purple fans a great recording of what can sometimes be a very badly recoreded band"
5,"Great Collection, wish they would rerelease it again!",I really loved this collection. I want to get it for a friend. I hope it comes back soon.
1,Not for kids under 4.,My daughter is 3 and is constantly placing the stamps on her body. The ink is not washable and I have to scrub to remove it. I would not recommend for a young child.
1,Blah...,"I have to push down VERY hard to see the stamp on paper, my 3 yr old can't push it hard enough. Crappy design."
3,Not bad...,"My daughter loves these, although the figures are durable, they do not seem to absorb the ink from the ink pad well and therefore the stamps are only so-so. But she loves it, and I guess that is what matters."
4,"""OK"" stamps","We purchased these for our 3 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves anything to do with stickers, coloring, cutting, pasting, stamping, etc. The ink on the face shapes do not always turn out well when stamping. Maybe they are not holding the ink correctly. The ink takes a minute or so to dry, so when you get it on the skin, it easily rubs off onto clothes/furniture. I've easily gotten the ink out of clothing w/a normal washing cycle. Getting the ink off skin can take a little work (or a long soak in the tub haha). The lids, so far, havnt been a problem, and have stayed on rather well (easy on/off removal). Probably with normal wear&tear, the little ring around the base that helps it 'click' on will rub thin and then the cap will not stay on. The characters on the stamps seem to be durable so far. If your child/gift receiver is a Dora fan and loves arts & crafts, then this is a wonderful gift."
4,A stylish director,"The paperback adequately covers the output of a very stylish Hollywood director. In particular I liked the format, asynopsis of each film, in chronological order, with comments from some stars appearing in them, plus many photos I've never seen before , and added to that a full cast list of each film.Though not in the same league the likes of ...Hawks, Wilder, Cukor et al , the majority of his films now seem dated (one which stands out from the others is a classic 1939 comedy....MIDNIGHT) toward the end of the 1940s his films went drastically downhill....a fate that eventually affected those directors noted above, so at least Leison was ingood company."
4,Good,"I do not know a lot about taking vitamins for emotional health. But, the book was written by someone with a lot of experience. It spells out, at least in some depth, what to take (though each case is different, she gives the basic general approach, while listing different variables). The book helped me feel more comfortable trying to take supplements and what-not for my emotional health, and was encouraging for me. There is a long bibliography in the back. Comprehensive, a good place to start finding out about the vitamin/supplement approach to emotional health."
2,It did not work for me,"After following and applying her program I realized that these supplements have more side effects than she describes, however this was at my own risk; just a word of warning!!"
3,"The book is clutch, the DVD not so much","The book is awesome - being 25 years old, this book pretty much covers sports history in my lifetime. However, the DVD leaves much to be desired (and I must admit, a big reason why I purchased this). Note, I don't know what the other guy was thinking, but the Y2K commercial is NOT ON THE DVD. There is no Charley Steiner saying ""FOLLOW ME TO FREEDOM!"". Unless I got a different edition. There are other commercials that are missing, like the one where the Syracuse Orangeman doing donuts in Terry Labonte's car. Overall, a good purchase. But don't expect much from the free DVD."
2,Giving it to Goodwill,"I bought this from the Bookstore at their ""burn bar."" They had a problem with the way it was downloaded and so I ended up with 2 copies of disc 2. But, then because of the confusion, I didn't get a chance to ""preview"" what I bought. How sad... I spent $20. for nothing. One of the guys in my Bible Study wanted to sing one particular song which was on this disc. I just didn't know that ""various"" meant NOT THE ORIGINAL artist. So, not only did I not get the original artist, but not even a comparable tenor voice, but a soprano.The instruments are overpowering and so it is hard to hear the words to the songs.I ended up finding another CD with the song I wanted from Walmart!...with the orginal artist! That CD was $6.00 cheaper than if I bought it at the bookstore."
2,Cookie Cutter Characters,"The characters have no spark together, not to mention both are cookie cutter versions of typical romance novels protagonists. The dialogue is lackluster, and quite silly oftentimes. Do not read this book if you are looking for complex, rich characters wtih a good plot."
4,Turn Left at Sanity is a Great Read!,This book was an easy read and it constantly made me laugh. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a great romantic comedy and I would definitely recommend it to others. It was truly entertaining. I usually read during my lunch hour to relieve the stress of the work day and this book definitely accomplished that goal.
5,Only buy through Amazon,"I'm glad I searched Amazon for this product. This is a cabin filter that must be replaced in my car every year. The dealership was asking $44.00 for this filter and that didn't include the labor rate to install it. (Note: it takes about 3 minutes to install this filter, no screws, nuts or bolts). I should also note that this is the exact same filter that the dealership was providing. Needless to say, I will be getting this air filter from Amazon every year."
2,Not an carbon-impregnated filter,"Amazon's descrption claims that this filter is carbon-impregnated. But the arrived product is just a plain paper filter. Its color is white, not like the stock one in my cobalt."
5,The Best of the Best Artists,"I found this 2 CD collection to be most enjoyable and a collection of the best of the best in artists. I seem to favor the NIGHTIME CD over the DAYTIME, but all in all a magnificent collection of music from around the world!"
5,A Pleasant Personal History,"All at once sweet, entertaining, exciting, unique, and moving, A Circus wihout Elephants was a pleasant surprise. Though Wills's family is distinct from any other, the reader cannot help but notice traits common to all families in her stories."
2,Disappointed with this diaper bag...,"I bought this diaper bag because I loved the pattern and it got good reviews. There are some great things about the bag- there are lots of compartments for little things like pacifiers, diaper cream, bottles, etc., the wide strap is really comfortable, and the detachable changing pad are all nice features. But what I don't like about the bag is that it has no structure, so the middle part tends to ""balloon"" outwards. The most frustrating thing about it is the zipper. The zipper isn't connected at one end, so when you unzip it, the whole zipper becomes disconencted. Additionally, after 1 month of use, the zipper stopped working altogether- when I would zip it, the zipper would come undone in the middle and then open up completely. So I'm now walking around with a diaper bag that is always open. Granted, it may be that I have a defective zipper, but I'd think that for $130, the bag would come with a more heavy-duty zipper on it."
2,cute but not worth the money,It's a cute bag but nothing special. I should have just bought a cheaper one at Target or something. There is no structure to the bag and does not have the kind of compartments I need to keep my diaper bag stuff organized.
5,love the fabric!,"I ordered this bag for myself as a ""splurge"" item for my fourth and final baby. I absolutely love it! It is the perfect size for me, and doesn't interfere with carrying my baby on my back (with carrier). My back-pack diaper bag, was too big, and I always was using something smaller. I love the print, feel of the fabric, and general construction of the bag. It is very user friendly and well made. I have a double stroller for my two youngest, so it doesn't fit over my stroller bar, but I don't care, I hardly use it. I also ordered the coordinating mini bag and medium snack bag to go with it, a perfect set, and still less than price of retail for one bag!"
4,When Will It End?,"This great track on this compilation, surprisingly hard to find in something resembling the version that got a lot of airplay in the 1960s, features a strong backbeat, driving rhythms and a consistent message. If you feel down, play this and feel better.Well, yes, it's admittedly shallow, sexist and juvenile. Joni Mitchell it ain't. But for sheer playability and youthful joy, what was its equal?""I'm not searching for a reason to enjoy myself, it seems it's better done, than argued with somebody else.""When will it end? Hopefully never."
3,Camp Cooking: 100 Years,"I bought this Dutch Oven cookbook, along with 101 Things To Do With A Dutch Oven and Cee-Dub's Dutch Oven and Camp Cookin', for my father-in-law for Christmas. The three were sold together for a savings. My father-in-law is really enjoying them. He makes new recipes and is always excited to share them with us. I personally liked the 101 Things To Do With A Dutch Oven best, but he seems to enjoy reading the trivia in this one and the other one."
1,All Mormon,I was disappointed that almost all the photos were of Mormons in Utah or Arizona - This book seems to ignore the many other non-Mormon pioneers and history.
3,A lot of Mozart for those who crave it,"This Mozart series is meant for the glutton who can't get enough of Mozart, so fills up with all forty-one symphonies (probably a half dozen are well-known and readily recognized, mostly the later works). I do enjoy playing the series once in a while, usually when my wife and/or granchildren are out. The quality is solid, the playing consistent, and it sure is a lot of Mozart!"
3,"A little too ""bleeding heart"" for me.....","Although extremely well written, Ms Wynn simply can't shake that ""do good"" naivete that permeates the privileged - that there's always a little good in everyone. Sorry Jennifer - Downright evil DOES exist - I've seen it during my own stint in Rikers Island (1979, 81-85 HDM, C-95 Clinic) as a medical professional. The corrections policy is far from perfect but, until we find the right approach, sociopaths MUST be kept from my family and yours."
3,"A little too ""bleeding heart"" for me.....","Although extremely well written, Ms Wynn simply can't shake that ""do good"" naivete that permeates the privleged - that there's always a little good in everyone.

The corrections policy is far from perfect but, until we find the right approach, sociopaths MUST be kept from my family and yours."
4,it was a good book,"the author takes you directly with some cats who did Bids and what the experience and how they were dealing with coming back to society upon finishing there sentence. the politics of the outside and inside world and the dealings are all quite interesting upon reading this book. very detail and it sounds like so many other storys, however RIkers has a reputation long standing and this book takes you there. quite compelling."
5,Read it before you go to Hollywood!,"This guide concisely takes us on a tour of the entertainment industry's marketing side without frills. A great ""how-to"" on getting your script out there: how to make connections, keep them and sell yourself at a meeting. An executive's point of view on where your script goes after it's read and sent to development. A great reality-check."
5,The Best Book You will Ever Read About selling your sscreenplay,"After writing my first screenplay, I was stuck on how to sell it. I have ran my own business for over tens years and have a natural flare for marketing - thinking that selling a script would be commonsense WRONG! After reading The Script Selling Game I was blown away by the fantastic real life tips and jargon given. It's motivated me more than ever to see my projects on the silver screen. IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT breaking into Hollywood - You MUST BUY THIS BOOK! It's easy-to-read and only an insider would know how to write it's contents."
3,All Instrumental,All Instrumental - not the original bond songs by the original artists.If you are looking for original theme songs with the words...do not buy this CD set.
1,A waste of time,I a gree with the nameless reader from Chicago. Plot moved too slowly characters were predictable and completely unsympathetic. The whole thing was a ludlum-esque overkill. Skip it.
1,It was a dark and stormy night ....,"This is the worst book I have read in a long time. It was written as if Reich had a special word processor that contained on its keyboard every cliche known to man. Characters were cartoons, situations were predictable, descriptions were trite . Is there anyone out there who has read this book who couldn't figure out the solution to Neumann's quandaries at least a hundred pages before he did? Was he really thay dull? If so, how could these brilliant captains of Swiss banking mistake him for a bright shining star? Some descriptions were truly laughable. Does Syria really have a 'royal blue sky'? Are we really to believe that Cerutti was found shot through the head with a white fluffy pillow resting on his stomach? Did Sylvia always have to laugh huskily before,during, and after sex? This book sank into my skull with a dull sickening thud on a dark and stormy night."
2,Disappointing,"Starts with a neat premise, but laborious to read. Very similar plot to the faster paced ""The Firm"". Plot gets bogged down in minute detail. overall, a miss. :("
1,Editor needed,"I wish I had read all the reviews before buying this book - which I did after enjoying The Runner. I am on page 128 now and don't think I will waste further time. But can a fan of the book explain to me how Nick, on page 100, was able to retrieve Senn's file from a portfolio manager's secretary when he is alone in the bank with the chief hall porter, page 99? Careless errors like this cause me to lose respect for the author and his ability to present a convincing and credible plot."
4,hope my colleagues aren't so!!,"I was very attracted to this book before reading it cos it spoke about banks' whirling-money world and, since I'm attending Finance courses (I'm just studying on the book mentioned in this one!) I thought it could be interesting. It is, indeed. It mixes really well banking thecniques, love stories, revenges and omicides, all in the serious and impeccable facade of Swiss banks. The novel is quite long, but your attention is quickly captured and you'll often say:""Ok, just only one more chapter"" while you'll read at least 3 or 4 more instead! It is very well written, we can easily tell not only Reich deeply knows the financial system but he knows, as well, how to create a sophisticated cobweb of intrigues you'll desperately want to work out."
5,The Best,This book has eveything. Excellent plot twists and characters. I couldn't put this one down. An awesome read.
3,Decent payoff,"A few too many characters and subplots complicate this story. It's one of those books where you find yourself going back 2-3 pages each night to re-read where you left off and refresh your memory. The book is long - 700+ pages - but that's not the problem. One of the key subplots - which becomes huge and I won't give anything else away - strains credibility. And the villians were a bit stereotyped.On the other hand, I enjoyed learning so much about Swiss Banking and the charms of Zurich.All in all, a marginal recommendation."
4,GRIPPING & SUSPENSEFUL,"Reich weaves an interesting story, and the book is highly informative about Swiss banking, cursory investment banking activities, etc.. It was very suspenseful, but Nick would have been better off staying @ Morgan Stanley!!"
3,A Good Read for Anyone Involved with the Financial Markets,"As an individual currently employed by an investment firm, I actually enjoyed this book. Although it only took me 3 days to read this, it was not a book that I would consider one that couldn't be put down. People who will enjoy this are Grisham fans who either work, or participate in some way, with investments. At times it was predictable but the premise was a good one. I feel that it could have been developed a bit more. All in all, not too bad. I will give his next offering a chance."
1,Don't bother.,"The first chapter, provided online, is so abysmally bad, who could bear to read on? Your rating system needs a `0'."
1,Angry at myself,"I agree with a previous reviewer that this book must have slipped past the editor, or perhaps Delacorte wanted to rush this book to print in order to cash in on the recent headlines about Swiss banks. The characters are stick figures; I didn't like or dislike the hero and I didn't like or dislike the villains. I just didn't care. It read as if Mr. Reich said to himself, ""Okay, he does this, and then she does that, and then this happens, and then that happens..."". There was no fleshing out of the characters and no meaningful descriptions of the people or places, as if the author had a list of adjectives and adverbs on his desk, and used them randomly throughout the book. I felt cheated, and angry at myself for falling for the early hype on this book."
1,don't waste your money,"I started reading this book 4 times, the beginning had no umph. Then, I decided this book would not beat me, I was wrong. The plot started to pick up after the first 170 pages. My hopes were high at this piont. Then the ending, ... a was of waste of. The writing is very wordy. The book is simply too long. This lenghthy book would have best been serverd as one of those short readers digest storied that one keeps in the bathroom."
4,brilliant story,"Despite the literary-snob remarks against it, I loved this book. Excellent character development; believable suspense and action scenes; and all against the backdrop of big-money and international crime- Who could ask for more?"
4,Ditto the reader from Philadelphia!,"I agree with the reader from Philly: Reich is a better writer than Grisham or Baldacci. And I disagree with many of the other readers who thought this book slow and dull and lacking in characterization. I will remember Nick Neumann and Peter Spracher much longer than any of Grisham's characters (I'm hard-pressed to think of even one). Where Reich needs to improve is, I think, in writing the action scenes. The fight scene between Nick and the villain up in the mountains was brief and without the kind of detail given to other parts of the book (e.g. the ins & outs of private banking). On the whole, the book easily held my interest and I'm looking forward to Reich's next effort."
4,Numbered Account - entertaining and interesting.,"I truly enjoyed this book beginning to end. The setting was terrific (although I would have enjoyed more detail on Zurich and Switzerland in general). The characters were reasonably developed, and the ending was quick-paced and interesting. The middle chapters were a little slow, but nowhere near as bad as a Tom Clancy novel. Overall it was fine entertainment and I would recommend it without hesitation."
2,"If you must read this, borrow it.","Mr. Reich may have some greater talent for writing than this novel shows, but if this is his strength based on his past employment in the banking industry, let' s hope he does not try to write about something he is not familiar with. Given the recent publicity about the Swiss banking industry, the novel was timely and, if accurate, I learned a great deal about that industry. However, the poorly developed collateral plot lines and the shallow characters did not allow me to enjoy this book the way that I had anticipated. The editing of this book is also very weak and I am convinced that a stronger editor could have shaped this into a much more readable book."
4,Financial Thriller Kept me Interested,"Swiss locale, unfolding mystery and banking kept me reading, and I enjoyed this book. The main character might have been fleshed out a little more."
1,Very slow moving-hard to keep awake in the mid sections.,"I read about 25 books a year and rarely have I found a book to be as tedious as this one. The character development is slow, the writing uninspired. It is hard to believe that the author received $2 million for this novel. I have no idea what the publisher was thinking. If you want to read it, get it from the library--and hope that they give you at least a three week check out period to get through it."
1,Maybe the worst book I've ever read,"The publishers of this book should be embarassed and ashamed of themselves. It was worse than bad - it was ludicrously inept. I could tell that the author was trying really hard, but he didn't seem to have a clue of what really makes a good book - or he had barely a clue, and seemed to think that was enough. In the hands of a better writer, I suppose this could have been an entertaining story - in the hands of this writer, it was just relentlessly boring. I just kept feeling sad for all of the really good writers out there who can't get published, while dreck like this is unleashed instead."
1,AWFUL,The only book this year that I couldn't finish. It just drags on and on. By page 150 you almost wish that the main character gets killed.
1,A poor attempt at being Grisham.,"Not much here. Sterotypical characters molded to implasible roles. Brightest of the bright higher by the best of the best _firms_. Powerful woman is made his lover. Firm's president is oblivious to his actions. US government needs his help. (Sound fimiliar?) Plot moves at times slow, other times slower. Writing is mediocre at best. Cliches abound. Character development is weak. Dialog seems force. One example has the protaginist kissing a women lamenting how long it has been since he has felt the touch of a women. Yet, on the very next page we are reminded of his fiancé last seen only two months ago. Give me a break! I cannot find any redeeming values to this book. I finished the drival hoping against hope for a smashing ending. Sigh. No such luck. Save your money reread _The Firm_."
2,The best I can say about this book is that it is mundane.,"Christopher Reich has picked a steroetypical lead; educated in the best schools, outstanding military service, American, a fiancee who does not understand him. Now the lead character chucks his life to discover who murdered his father. Voile! We need some bad guys! Throw in bankers and Arab terrorists. Since the fall of the communist regimes in Eastern European countries, we have had to have new bad guys in thrillers. Nowadays it is Arab terrorists. I got so bored with this book that I put it down a little over half way through it. Don't waste your time on this novel. There are too many well written books out there to read. Try ""Memoirs of a Geisha""."
2,definitely not a keeper,"I read this book over a week's time. It did not call me to it at the end of the day. I kept reading it to have something to do. I hated the flash backs. The action didn't move until the last forty or so pages. This book was a terrible disappointment to me. I also didn't think the characters were believable. I lost patience with them early on. This is definitely not, in my opinion, in the style of David Baldacci. Shame on you for saying it is. Finley Adams"
4,Great first effort though a little long,"Zurich has to be one of the most often used locations for international intrigue. This particular book revolves around the shenanigans of Swiss banking and international drug running. The characters are well fleshed out and the denouement is appropriately climactic. That said, I found the tome to be overweight. I was surprised that the author's editor did not use the red pen more liberally. Two hundred pages less and we would have had a real pot boiler on our hands."
2,"Good premise, not such a good story","I was excited to read the book. The premise looked good, but the story line didn't pan out. The details into the banking world was not done very well. The characters were two dimensional. Not much detail into the Marine Corps officer program.For those who read the book, if you know a little about semi automatic weapons, there's a chapter where someone runs out of ammunition and does not know it. Doesn't the weapons's slide lock back when it fires it's last bullet?"
1,Astonishingly awful writing,"I bough this in haste, expecting a considered, perhaps rather clever financial thriller. What I found was the kind of mind-numbingly atrocious writing I thought had long since died out. I'm amazed the publishers let Mr Reich get away with it. It only shows what idiots they must think thriller buyers are...."
4,True to its Reviews,"I find the value of one liners plastered on book covers to be a dime-a-dozen, especially with NYT Bestsellers. However, I found Numbered Account to be worth its weight in words. I quickly became addicted and found myself unable to put it down. Thanks Mr. Reich for restoring my faith in one line reviews."
3,"Good idea, but...","The cover of this novel initially got my attention, then after I read the back cover I decided to purchase it. I am not a fast reader and the further I got into this book the longer it took to finish a new page. I put it down after page 100 and gave it away. I am currently reading his followup ""The Runner"". The similiar front covers sent up flags, but the WWII setting got my attention. I made it past page 100. It is a better, faster paced book. I recommend ""The Runner"" over ""Numbered Account""."
2,Formulistic thriller,"I began reading with high hopes for a really gripping read. By halfway, I had to give up. The book reads as though written by a computer program; every chapter ends with a little mini climax. The writing style is ""american thriller"", i.e. nothing distinctive. I felt little empathy or sympathy for any of the characters, and most were cardboard cutouts - especially the arabs, who seemed to be uniformly cast as villians. A really bad knockoff of the Grisham style. Undoubtedly will be picked for movie of the week..."
3,"Thought that I was reading ""The Firm"".","I'm surprised no one has made the comparison between ""Numbered Account"" and ""The Firm"". There ware too many plot similarities in the first half of the book for me to believe that this was Reich's original story idea."
3,Pretty formularised American hero stuff,Pretty formularised American hero stuff: ex-marine leaves good job as a lawyer to go on a search for his father's murderers. Being set in a Swiss bank is original but it is not too exciting and towards the end the story becomes too unbelievable.
1,mediocre knock-off of Grisham,"Reich's biography states that he used to work in a private banking dept of a Swiss bank in Zurich, so I suppose that gives him the credibility to write a mediocre novel about private banking dept of a Swiss bank in Zurich. But to add excitement, he adds international terrorist plot, lots of beautiful but treacherous women, and equally numerous treacherous and murderous men. It proves a tedious reading, and you'll end up counting the number of obnoxious characters before drifting off to sleep."
1,Awful formula effort on pretty dull subject,"There are pretty few purely financial thrillers around, and they generally do well. This must explain the fuss that has been made by the publishers over this otherwise corny, cardboard effort. Just because your characters are rich and move a lot of money around doesn't make them interesting; and none of these guys come over as more than cyphers. The detail on finance may be all be true, but that only serves to make the plot itself all the more unbelievable and silly. I was hoping this book would entertain me over a long journey, but after 300 pages of grinding my teeth I couldn't stomach it any longer."
1,Didn't even finish it,"I chose this one for my cross-country Christmas plane trip. I had high hopes.I ended up reading the airline magazine on the return trip instead.Way way way too long for what it was. I abandoned it about 150 pages from the end. I haven't left a book unfinished since I read half of Ivanhoe in high school.I wanted to like it and the plot is suitably labyrinthine, I suppose, but it was oddly cold. I just didn't care what was going on."
2,standing in line at the bank,This is a book with a unique story. I loved the characters & locations. Overall I think it needed more action. I know it's titled Numbered Account but there was a little too much about the inner workings of a bank for my taste. I'm hoping The Runner will be better...I'm giving you another chance C.R.
4,Solid thriller,"This was recommended by a friend after my telling him about another I read recently,Trojan Horse, which is partly set in the financial world, with lifelike situations and characters. Despite the fact that Numbered Account is set in the financial world, I didn't find the financial discussions or the personalities all that convincing. But that was my only complaint.Once this gets going, it's a fast-paced and suspenseful story that grabs you and holds you. I haven't read any more of Reich's work, but based on this, as I understand his first novel, I'll be reading more."
5,Hall of Fame Great Thriller!,"Numbered Account is one of the most interesting and compelling books I've read in the last few years. The story of an American MBA who takes a job with a Swiss bank to discover who murdered his father 17 years earlier was hard to put down. Not only was it suspenseful, but chock full of insider information about how Swiss banks really work. Numbered Account is as good as anything Paul Erdman wrote, and frankly, as enjoyable as any of the novels coming these days from the big names like Grisham, Follett and Clancy. I also recommend Reich's second book, The Runner and The Last Convertible by Anton Myrer"
4,This book was an education for me...,"...in the ways of Swiss banking. I bought it for a few pesos at a yard sale, and being unfamiliar with the author, was not convinced it was worth my time to read it. Once I began, I was hooked. The author created a sympathetic character who was smart, clever and accomplished, and Reich is quite adept at using flashbacks to provide motivation for his protagonist. He creates a world with which I am totally unfamiliar, and he makes it comfortably habitable for the duration of the book. He provides enough environmental detail to maintain the reader's interest and salts the book with enough red herrings to deflect any foregone conclusions. The book moves along with a steady pace, and as it picked up speed, I had difficulty putting it down. I might take issue with his female characters, who seem a bit predestined and two-dimensional, but perhaps that is the reality of the world they inhabit. I will certainly be looking for more books by Mr. Reich."
2,Routine pot-bolier,"Interesting plot, but poorly written. I'm prepared to accept the poor characterization and unconvincing dialogue, but a thriller writer should get the details right. Reich's incorrect use of medical jargon, and his description of the injuries suffered by the various protagonists, show that he is out of his depth. Worse (because the blurb on the cover sells his expertise in banking) he incorrectly titles, and misspells the author, of a standard finance text - Principles of Corporate Finance (page 423). If he can't get the elementary things right how convincing is the rest going to be?"
2,Fool me once...,"I bought this title based on a recommendation from Amazon. I will be more careful in the future. This novel plodded along with dull characters, poor prose, and a not-very-interesting plot. I think the author (who has gone on to be published again!) must know someone in the publishing biz. I should have such friends! I must admit I could not get past the first 100 pages. Life is too short."
2,Maybe the later books get better,"I tossed the book after only 50 pages. The plot action was too cartoonish. Somebody pushes you from behind but you cannot identify them ? You go blundering into a restricted area on your first day on the job ? Sorry, the willing suspension of disbelief won't stretch that far."
5,First Class Thrill Ride,"The book reads like Michael Crichton writing with John Grisham. The intricacies of the story mixed with the first class action work perfectly. Except for a minor, unneccessary detour with the Marines subplot, the book seems unblemished."
5,Absolutely Incredible,One of the best page turners I have ever had the pleasure to read. Numbered Account pulls in the reader right away and does not let go until the very end.
3,A fair overview of the First World War,"Slam Marshall gives a comprehensive review of the ground war in WW I. Unfortunately, there is no mention of the air war nor of its contribution to the land battles. At times, the paragraphs ramble and lose the reader. However, the first chapter is an excellent introduction of events leading to the war. Certainly, General Marshall gives an insightful review from a military officer's perspective."
2,Well Received.,Received the book well wrapped and preserved.Write up should have had a comment about back cover of book being waterlogged.Book was in decent enough shape overall.
5,AWESOME LIVE PURPLE,"One of DP's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome Digital Remastering. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"
3,An avid gambler,"The previous reviewer is correct when he says this a basic book for the first-time gambler. However, this is what the ""Everything"" series tries to do. These books will not make you an expert in any particular field. If you know someone who gambles occasionally, for them, this book is perfect. It covers many games and while not getting too in depth, tries to bring up the areas of each game in which to be concerned. Show me any other beginner's gambling book that covers every game any better than this one."
1,Ouch!,"I HATE it! I'm GREEN, GREEN, GREEN!!! WHY must this specific recording be reissued? It should have stayed in the basement vault! It makes me cringe and squirm! I was 22; I needed those next years of singing to develop. May it get forgotten FAST. Or better yet, let Johnny Herald sing ""Stewball"" over and over in substitution for those tracks of mine! Listening to myself on New Folks at least puts the fire under me to get cracking faster reissuing my later & more current recordings!Don't buy that record! Or, if you do, put your fingers in your ears! Hedy West <HedyWest@aol.com>"
2,mediocre product,I was not at all impressed with this product.My hair is shedding and breaking just as much as ever even though I have been trimming it. I'm going back to Hair formula 37 which is more expensive but I haven't found anything that compares out there.
3,Longer Hair,"So I bought this product when I started experiecing ongoing months (about 4-6) of excessive hair loss and eventually hair thinning. I was looking for a supplement that would make my hair stronger because it seemed my hair couldn't resist detangling, especially when it was wet. Tons of hair would come out. After being on this for about three months, I noticed not much changed. My hair was still falling out, as a matter of fact, it's been worsening; however, I can say that the product helps your hair grow longer, faster. It's a good product if you want to grow your hair longer at a faster pace."
5,Recommended,Someone spoke highly about these so I decided to give them a try. I really like them and can notice a difference after only a month. Only thing is you have to make sure to increase your water intake because it will make your urine smell
4,NEXXUS IS ALWAYS A WINNER.,"BOUGHT THESE SUPPLEMENTS AND THEY HELPED MY HAIR LOSS.I FOUND THEM EXPENSIVE BUT, I ONLY BOUGHT 2 BOTTLES I BELIEVE.I USED THEM AROUND THE SAME TIME AS THE VITA TRESS ESSENTIAL KIT SO,THEY ALL WORKED GOOD FOR ME. NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT NEXXUS.I PURCHASE NEXXUS HERE IN MONTREAL, SO ITS ALL GOOD."
4,Works great; arrived on time,"Good strong plastic. Came with rubber strips for different diameter handlebars. Was easy to install and installed in a sturdy way on my mountain bike so I'm not worried the GPS will fall off in rough riding. The GPS snaps in and out well. You do have to screw a part to the back of the GPS which makes it a little bit bigger (if you carry it in your pocket) and which has to be removed to change batteries, but it's OK.Definitely only for the Garmin Gecko, but that's part of what makes it work so well.Had no trouble with vendor; it arrived very quickly.Only four star rating because in my book five stars would only be for astounding products that do something I don't expect."
1,Geko only!,Overpriced piece of plastic that will only fit the Garmin Geko unit though the description mentions that fact nowhere.
4,Pretty but a little snug,It just arrived. It is so pretty but the calve area is a little tight for me. I wish it has an elastic expansion at the top for a better fit.
2,Not really the beginning,"This dvd set, ""New Beginning"" is anything but the beginning of the series. It's episodes 2-5. Why they would do this, I have no idea. It makes no logical sense to me. I ordered it because Cartoon Network Started with Episode 3. Which also makes no sense because the first 2 setup the entire series."
3,trans fan,"It's not a bad movie to have,It's the beginng of the series.I would watch it to see if I would wanted to add to my collection."
5,Spastic and rockin!,"Don't believe the lame and pointless review posted above, explain why you didn't like it instead. I love this album and fans of that early/mid 90's noisey, Gravity Records esque art rock/punk whatever will enjoy this as well. Kind of hard to compare what it sounds like to other bands, maybe a trashier and and spazzier Dahlia Seed meets a less violent Brass Knuckles For Tough Guys, again, hard to compare. The songs are jolty and take sudden turns. Summer's lyrics are also very well written and clever. So if you are looking for something rocking but interesting, you will enjoy this.Also, that isn't the album cover, that is the cover of a ""Slaves"" album."
4,"nice shirt, runs large",I ordered three shirts Sm M L for our high school jazz band. The quality was very good but the size ran a little large. We decided they were not quite right for our uniform so I returned them. The return process was very prompt. I got my refund within 3 days.
4,The biggest show in town,"This CD features music from Hanna-Barbera cartoons, obviously. It starts off with their first cartoon, Ruff and Ready, from 1957 and goes to Scooby Doo, from 1970. The music includes theme music and background scores. If you grew up watching Hanna-Barbera cartoons, you will probably recognize a lot of this music. The sound quality is surprisingly good, considering the age of the music and the fact that it was recorded for television. This is a lot of fun to listen to if you are a cartoon buff. But whatever happened to the promised Volume 2? It was supposed to feature music from shows likeTop Cat,The JetsonsandJonny Quest, but it never came out."
3,Interesting but seems biased,"I never read autobiographies because I'd rather an outsider's perspective; more objective. But this tilts too much in that direction I think. He seemed to relish Branson-bashing. It's likely his take on things is accurate, but he writes in a way that seems spiteful and well, envious.Still, I imagine it's a lot more accurate than Branson's own accounts of his life."
4,Fun Book!,"This is a fun book and the stories are enjoyable. it is also a good introduction to theis person's MAGICK.Ultimately, I think its specific imports are meeting the author and perhaps helping one develop their own personal oracle methods."
5,Outstanding Latin guitar team,Each composition is stands on its own with memorable and passioned playing.Great music for a trip to Santa Fe.
4,Great for your tool box!,"This cordless screwdriver, does hold a charge for weeks and is perfect for the little jobs around the house. No need for a big bulky expensive hand drill. This one will get the job done.."
3,Not exactly for dummies,"I use this book to help my Mexican boyfriend learn more English for his job. This is the second book we have purchased, and while it is VERY in-depth for a beginner book, it is somewhat overwhelming and off-putting. Since I am a native English speaker, I am able to unravel some confusion for him that might otherwise have remained unclear. The material is good, but a little bit too grammar-oriented for the novice English student."
4,"Not bad, just be prepared to wait...","Ingles para Dummies is a pretty good resource for those learning English, but be prepared to wait a really long time to receive it. Amazon promises shipping that it never delivers, the wait on this book wasn't too bad, maybe 2 weeks, but I have had other books take over a month and then just not show up and Amazon is not too responsive about these shipping issues unfortunately."
5,So Good It Stopped My Pain,"I am a fan of Richard Whittingham's work and normally would have eagerly anticipated RITES OF AUTUMN. But my life was far from normal. I was exhausted, three days past very invasive day-long surgery and was hurting like hell when my wife surprised me with the book that evening. Here is how good this book is. I stayed up until 2PM finishing it -- literally feeling no pain. The next day I paid for this splurge without regret. Grateful for this wonderful work, I recommend it to anyone interested in our nation's rich traditions. Like Whittingham's other work, RITES OF AUTUMN is far more than a sports book."
1,What an awful video!,"My 2 and 4 year olds watch a wide variety of videos, from educational to downright silly. They usually have some degree of interest in anything even mildly entertaining. With this video they actually left the room after about 3 minutes. To use M. Beattie's words (because they are very appropriate) this video is ""painfully stupid""! Luckily, this was a library rental, and it immediately went back. I wouldn't recommend this video to anyone with kids of *any* age."
1,Does not even deserve 1 star,"This was watched once in our home, and I will not let my 2 1/2 year old watch it again. It is absolutely mindless, and for lack of any other word, painfully stupid."
3,"Decent Guide book however, misses a number of important older handguns","Decent Guide book however, misses a number of important older handguns, especially WWII handguns. Good reference for a collectors library but there are better."
5,Great to listen to for a stress reliever,These fellows make the greatest smooth jazz to listento.Hope they continue to putout more great CDs.
5,Can't put it down,This book contains 21 infamous ship wrecks in the Atlantic from 1850 to the present. Its well written and hard to put down. Stories come alive and I sometimes feel like I'm on one of these ships sailing from Liverpool to New York. Its amazing to see how most of these shipwrecks could have been prevented if crews were not so careless. Kudos to the author.
2,Sinking in mediocrity,"Having read the ship disaster books by AA Hoehling and Edward Rowe Snow, I had expectations that Flayhart would add something new to the story. Instead, what I found was his book is a pale imitation of theirs. He didn't copy them word for word, however, the information and the structure is almost identical. The information is so basic, you can find it all online. Anyone can find the same material in the same archives or use others books as a guide/reference, but that is the easy way out. It's clear Flayhart put little effort into this book. Those looking for original research should probably buy the ones by Hoehling and Snow."
4,Bought for boyfriend,An indepth exploration of various shipwrecks and collisions. Worth the read. He really enjoyed it. If someone is interested in shipwrecks buy this book.
4,Nice Mix Of Traditional Native American Music w/Modern Beats,"This is one of the many excellent groups/artists found on the Higher Octave label. This is the description from Higher Octave: Yulara means 'the howling of the dingos' and is the name of an Australian village close to Ayers Rock. Join Yulara on a colorful and imaginative tour of the original mutualities between different tribes or nations, and nature. Saxophones, flutes, guitars and keyboards combine with didgeridoo, chanting, environmental sounds and Urban Jazz rhythms to create a place where ""all is one.""I can't add much to this accurate description except to say that the blend really works making this a very enjoyable CD to listen to. Highly recommended."
4,beautiful and sad,"If you've ever had a relative or loved one slip away into dementia, this book will strike home. And if you've had a friend going through this experience, this book will help you to understand what they are going through. This book, like the experience of living with dementia, is at times funny, at times tearful. It's an honest picture of what it's like to be with someone who is rapidly losing who they were."
2,Not quite good enough!,"As a historian, I've read several types of books for several reasons. Not being an expert on the Second World War, I read much of this book discovering just what happened during this century's biggest struggle. Knowing something of Ike and very little of Montgomery, I was able to fill in some of the blanks. If you are looking for a military history, a John Keegan work this is not. If you are looking for some real insight into the personal, professional, and commander/lieutenant relationship, you will be left wanting. If you are looking for a brief overview of the history of Ike's and Monty's relationship, you will enjoy this read."
2,Would not be my first choice,"1. the construction of the book was done poorly. 19 out of 26 students in my class have books that are literaly falling apart and they are brand new! 2. of the few questions the solutions manual does solve, it seems to only answer the easier questions in the homework and the answers are hard to follow sometimes. 3. the examples given at the beginning of the chapter are also sometimes hard to follow and are difficult to imposible to use as help in homework problems 4. this new style of teaching does have one advantage...the instructor may slow their schedule if they see the class may be struggling in a section"
1,polite people don't say it in public,"This is, without a doubt, the most incredibly worthless book I have come across in my college experience. I am getting an A in Calculus in spite of, and NOT because of this book. The so-called ""Harvard Method"" leaves the student with the concepts of calculus, but with none of the tools to actually perform the operations. If you get stuck with this as a required text, I strongly recommend you also purchase a traditional calculus text to actually learn from."
1,total trash,Skipped around leaving some odd problems out of book. Only explained a few problems in total detail. This is by far the worst solutions manual on the market. Bring it back for a refund before its to late.
2,Not for the svn user.,"Book glosses over the basics and then spends 3/4 of the book delving into advanced topics. Not a book to become a competent every-day user of svn. If you are a sysadmin alredy very familiar with svn and looking to develop it at your site, then it may be for you."
2,Age has made this book unimpressive,"This book seems to have been written based on a version < 1.0 and that results in many features advanced users will need or at least want to use. The book assumes bdb backend and there is no mention of the fsfs backend that now is the default.I hoped this book would provide more advanced insight and thereby be the perfect companion to the ""Version control with Subversion"" book. That would probably have worked well if the current release was 1.0, but this book is unfortunately too old to be useful that way.An updated version of this or even better a ""Subversion Cookbook"" would be very interesting."
2,out of date,"out of date, mostly a recapitulation of the online redbean materials.since dated, it's not terribly relevant. 1.0. 1.4 just shipped! should say so in the title prominently and in the descriptions."
2,Could have been more practical,"Practical Subversion misses the balance between the version control newbie and the power user. Either the information is very basic and the same things you can get from the free, online, and up-to-date documentation (http://svnbook.red-bean.com/), or the information isn't enough.This book doesn't make subversion any easier to use, and there aren't tricks for getting around its verbose interface. This isn't work-a-day subversion: it flips between novice user and power administrator without much stuff in the middle.If you already have a subversion book, or can get by with the online documentation, flip through this book at a bookstore before you buy it. Look for the answers to the things you didn't find elsewhere before you decide to buy it."
1,"Visually Pleasing, Ergonomically Useless","I will have to give away this chair. Even the cheapest barren chair forces me to sit up straight at the computer and this chair doesn't even really allow for anything approximating a decent poster by comparison. But the worst part is that the foam seating is is so wrongly shaped that after half an hour it actually hurts to sit on it. It doesn't give to your body at all and is oddly curved in a convex, not concave manner. So now I sit on a cheap office chair until I invest in something designed for the human body. Perhaps it will be a Herman Miller after all. Sorry about the negative review folks, but this really made me feel awful sitting in it and you should spare yourself the wasted money and unnecessary discomfort in my opinion."
4,worthwhile for a four year old.,"My grandaughter likes all these episodes, and it is more educational than some of the kid series. She also likes the brother series Diego. She likes the idea of learning spanish but it is sometimes hard to understand the spanish translations clearly. Though not always her first choice, she always watches when it airs."
1,want to block,I would like to know how to block this type of content from my child. I'm not a fan of her being forced to learn Spanish!
1,Dora Sucks,Dora is so annoying and boots is stupid. I dont know how I even bought this must of been a mistake.
1,Bear hunt rip-off?,"Just saw the Dora episode Berry Hunt. It appears to be a rip-off of famous children's book We're going on a bear hunt, but the story makes no sense. They go pick berries as the fox's place but when the fox comes to claim his own berries, they accuse him of stealing...? Three year olds don't mind of course, but to me it appears that these videos were made very thoughtlessly."
5,kids love dora,I bought Dora because my kids love Dora. Dora and boots always have to problem solve. It teaches problem solving.
5,An old favorite,"I got my copy of Old Houses in a book store bargain bin several years ago. What a find it was! The houses in this book are honest about their age; no fancy restorations here (but do we really need another book like that anyway?). This book gives you an unusual glimpse of the old houses that don't make the magazine covers. In these houses the plaster may be crumbling, the wallpaper peeling, or the decorating may be hopelessly out of date. In addition to the haunting photography you will find interesting stories about the houses and their families. If you're into historic preservation and you like your old houses ""as found"" check this book out. This is one I go back to over and over."
5,I wish everyone could discover the magic of Doug Cameron!,Doug Cameron is outstanding. I own everything of his. The problem is that he does not make enough music and it is always difficult to find his name in most music stores. It doesn't matter if you are feeling sad...just listen to any of his music and you will be transformed. I wish everyone could discover this talented artist. When is a new CD coming out Doug? We haven't had anything from you since 1997. Stop working on the cruise ships for a brief time and create more music for your loyal fans!
1,Do not buy!,The daughter of a friend is currently in the hospital after an injury from these. She tripped and fell and the hair ties caused a skull fracture. Do not use!
1,"Warning, keep you sales slip","(Why don't they offer zero stars?)I purchased and installed the product (several times, again with patches), when it is opened it will display no verses. After multiple attempts all I recieved from tech support is 'we have problems with XP, this patch is supposed to fix it'(same answer to both responses of 5 requested). It did not on mine. I cannot get any more response from tech support, but rest assured I am on the mailing advertisement list. I responded with my problem to the e-mail. One week later I received something from quickverse. Another 'anonymous' buy our product."
1,Won't Purchase,"I was getting ready to buy this item, Quickverse 8.0, but after Reading the review by ""True Grit"" I've changed my mind. It never pays to stiff your customers!"
2,clumsy and slow,"Unlike True Grit, mine worked fine, except it was clumsy and slow to search. In my old version 4, I could have 3 versions plus the Greek Bible in the same window. Then, when I highlight a word in the KJV, I could immediately see the corresponding meaning in the original Greek! But, for some reason, I can't get the version 8 to work. It had too much junk to make it worthwhile and user-friendly. Buy it only if your computer is very fast and you have lots of money to burn."
3,"Informative, but a bit pricey","I originally bought this book for a university course several years ago, and have now found myself referring to it again in my new job (my parents shipped it from Australia for me). Found it useful for explanations on various semiconductor processes, but is perhaps a bit dated now (quite a bit has changed since 1986!). A bit pricey."
5,Philips MC235B Great sound and great price!,"I had a Boze CD player for about 6 years, and it got to the point where it wouldn't play some of my old CDs or ones that I made on my computer, so I decided to replace it. I thought this Philips MC235B would be just OK, but I really like it, and the sound is great. I also like the sleek, modern look of it."
3,pro/con,"pro:attractive design/shapeslimmer profilecredit card size remotevery clear sound fidelity from speakers, even though only 10watt speakersexceptionally strong radio reception (specially devoted looped am ant. and long fm ant. cords)con:no mp3 functionalityblue round bubble LED only visible staring straight on, otherwise, creates a nuisancenoisy grinding CD tray after finishing playing a CDmechanical noises with repeat function turned on (sounds like a laser shooting sound effect)varies with CDs: since this system spins cds vertically, I've found that with some cds, there is a low spinning noise that probably comes from an imperfect cd-cdplayer fit.Sum: an audiophile might not like this unit, but a casual listener probably won't mind the cons."
2,quit working after a month,I was disappointed with this system. when it worked the sound was great and i loved it that we could attach our MP3 player to it. but then after a month the CDs wouldnt work. Tried to fix it and called tech support also but couldnt figure it out. Since i had bought it using some credit card points i couldnt return it as well. the radio still works. I gave 2 stars because of being a poorly built product.
2,Sub-par for the price,"I was very disappointed with this item for the amount that I paid for it. The sound quality was very good, but there were other flaws with the unit that caused my dissatisfaction. The AM radio reception is TERRIBLE, and that was my primary reason for buying the unit. Also, the power of the speakers is far too great for use in an office setting. I had this unit in my office on the lowest volume, and it was still far too loud. I unhooked one speaker, and my office mates were still bothered. This system may do well for a different setting, but it is certainly not of any use for listening to the radio in a quiet setting."
2,Disappointing,"I am disappointed in this product. Sound quality is not all that good. When playing cd's, it pauses in between tracks. Not good if you're listening to continuous mix cds. All other Philips products i've owned in the past have been excellent, but this is a letdown."
1,A piece of garbage,I should have listened to all the bad reviews here on Amazon. About three weeks after I bought it an intermittent loud buzzing/static sound started when I played CDs. Luckily it was about 5 days before the 30-day return window would have expired and I was able to get my money back. Do not be fooled by the sleek design in the photo. Putting the CDs in and out is awkward. You also need to be careful since the laser that reads the CDs is exposed and could be easily scratched while you are putting the CDs in. The speakers and sound aren't that great either. Spend the extra bucks and get a decent system. And pay attention to the bad reviews!!
4,Great gift,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it, the design, blue light. Only it does not play mp3!"
3,It's OK,"It's OK. Somehow, it's bigger and heavier than I expected. It only plays CDs that are in pristine condition. If they are tired or scratched even a tiny bit...they won't play. It's not really loud and it's not very clear when you turn up the volume so it is not good for heavy music. [i.e. Korn fans should pass on this one, for instance.]However...if you're looking to listen to your Aerosmith CDs while doing the dishes, then it's fine for you. :)"
4,Phillis Micro Shelf System,Very happy with system...especially very easy and simple to use...a great unit for the price!!!
2,Not my first choice!,Needs much more space than you might assume by reading the description! And the sound is rather tinny.Nice touch seeing the CD spin doesn't make up for the bad sound and big footprint.
2,CD Player stopped working,"I loved this thing until about 3 months after we bought it and the CD player stopped working. We didnt buy the extended warrenty so we were SOL. we went about a year with it and all of a sudden the CD player started working again...but not for long. After another 3-4 months, it quit on us again. The sound is/was great, and it was very easy to use and loved that i can put it on the wall. I would only recomend this product if you buy the warrenty for it. Everything else was great. I am now looking for one that is similar but that i can hook my mp3 player up to it."
3,"sound quality, sound control","Because my $500 JVC shelf stereo failed and JVC ignores the failure, I bought this Philips product.Costing under $100, it sounds OK, but lacks really excellent sound quality and ability to control treble and bass. Bass enhancer (DBB control) yields an annoying hollow sound ( as if you had water in your ears ).Other than that, I'm ready to trust Philips."
3,"Affordable, but it has it's quirks.","The stereo isn't bad for it's money. It puts out reasonably good sound for <$100. It has it's quirks though.The really nice touch is the EJECT button on the remote. I have never seen this on any device I've ever owned, but if you think about it: On most other stereos you have a CD in one hand and the remote in the other, you have to put one of them down to open the case. Simple, effective thinking.The big design flaw to me is the PAUSE function. After 5 or so minutes, PAUSE changes to STOP, thus losing your spot on the CD. Most reasons I hit pause take longer than 5 minutes.The laser has popped out of alignment twice in the years I have owned it. After the second time, I realized i just needed to manually slide the laser carriage all the way back to the parked position. It doesn't happen very often, but it was really annoying the first time.Not a bad product, but I wouldn't buy it again."
1,pretty POS,"This product is very pretty. Its sleek and looks very modern. That been said, it is not worth the money however cheap it may be. It worked for 1 MONTH then the cd part just spins with no music. If you unplug it without powering down first, there is no music. The radio part works fine but its not worth the price better to put another $50 and but something else. DO NOT BUY."
2,Just as the warranty expires...,"I put this on my wedding registry and was very happy to find it as a gift. We used it a couple times the first year then went to use the CD player and it grinds and says ""no disc"". I contacted Phillips via web chat and Donna (the contact) mistyped words and used a foreign variation of terms (centre for center). It was obvious that she is overseas and could NOT help me find a service center since Philips does NOT have any authorized service centers. I am so sad as the sound from the speakers was magnificant. It would be cheaper for me to buy another system then pay for the repair estimate labor and part replacement. Sad day and I will avoid Philips products in the future as the value is questionable."
3,Cheaper at Walmart,"I bought this at Walmart for half the price that's listed here on Amazon. Got it as a gift for a friend who was in the hospital in long-term care so he'd have something to listen to while convalescing in the hospital. He loved it and listened to it every day using ear-buds until somebody at the hospital stole it out of his room in the middle of the night when he was sleeping.He had really liked it and thought I had paid far more for it than what I did.Check Walmart first before buying it on here, if they have it in stock you'll save some money."
1,Tuner didn't work,"The unit arrived with no visible damage. However, the tuner section was dead - no sound, not even any hiss or noise. CD section worked fine, but the unit does not play my MP3 discs - big disappointment. Had to return it for a refund, but that process was very painless. Great customer service from Essex Tech Group. Philips stuff has always been second tier. Better off sticking with the Sonys and Panasonics of the world."
5,Fits on a Bookshelf,Works as intended. Nice sound. The only issue is that the CD door slides up so although it fits in a bookself it makes it hard to insert and remove CDs. Otherwise nice compact unit.
2,Philips MC235B Flat Wall Mountable Micro Shelf System (Black),"The radio is good unfortunately sometimes you hear a lot of static. The antennas were placed properly and all. I am not sure why this occurs. With that exception, the product is okay."
2,Modem,"It was cheap, it would have to retry 8 to 12 times before it would stay connected. So after 15 to 20 minutes, usually I could stay online. I kept it about 4 months, got something else that works better."
5,I love it!,"Very comfortable, light weight and good looking! Good for summer due to extremely breathable design. No shoestrings, just slip and go!"
4,A Solid Resource on the Subject of IBD,This compilation of various articles written by IBD experts from across the country is an official Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America publication and that endorsement alone should indicate its quality and content. Every chapter in this book is well written and scrupulously up-to-date with excellent references and resources. Chapter subjects are very holistic in that both the medical and emotional aspects of IBD are represented. There is even a chapter on the use of alternative medicine in the treatment of IBD! Definitely purchase this book for your library.
5,genuine treasure,"This book by Master Hon is a hidden treasure only to be truly perceived by the sincere of heart. It is for beginners and advanced practitioners on the path of life, which is meandering and unpredictable. With these healing stories and gentle instructions we can walk this path with open breath and clear eyes.Master Hon's gift is to affirm the beginner's search for the appropriate teacher and to trust her own heart. For the more advanced practitioner he offers an empowerment to climb further up the rocky face of the mountain that is her self-awareness.For both, the result is the joy of a light Spring snow."
5,"understand trunking is not ""trunking""","This is a great switch. I wish, so bad I had found this before I wasted money on my netgear switches. This is so feature rich, I spent quite some time learning how all the features work. You do need another kind of switch to fully use the vlans offered by this unit. I did figure out this trunking is not the cisco type of trunking. If you want the cisco type, it is called ""tagged"" in the vlan config. This trunking is more like link aggregation. This is a nice feature to have! On a final note, this model has been discontinued. The new HP hotness is the 1810G-8.My only complaints are. This switch does not support STP, or spanning tree protocol. They have updated the firmware the pass the traffic to prevent a packet storm. Also the IP you use to manage this switch does not support IPv6. This should be really easy to add. I just want it to have a set IPv6 address.Wonderful unit."
5,By far the best switch I have owned!,"Awesome throughput and very stable. Once I upgraded the firmware it hasn't stalled or crashed on me once (not that it ever should).If you are serious about home networking, skip the cheap stuff and get this. You will not regret it!"
3,I would want to change too,"I am very impressed that anyone could survive this childhood. My problem was with the writing. I give anyone 3 stars for writing a book and having had to live that life had to be awful and I am very sadden that it happened. With that being said, the story just never let me get close to the characters or really understand them. It is hard to give a review to someone's life, but this just did not give me a feeling that the family got better after they grew up. I feel much anger at the Mother, who is said to be a ""hero"". I can't put myself in her shoes, but I would think with her military background she could have taken care of her family without living with abuse to herself and her family."
4,A wonderful story of downhome Southern living,"Barbara's childhood is a two-sided tale of adjustment and/or abuse. Of course by all means, she is a survivor. And was able to mold herself into an independent person with goals and plans already set when she was still a child. Her love/hate relationships with her parents helped her fight more to improve herself as a way out of her hard Southern uprbringing."
5,A Great Memoir of a Complex Family Life (see more about me),"I think in years to come,this will stand out as anAmerican classic.Americans on the whole were living betterthan ever in the years after World War II. Too bad herDad didn't take advantage of the G.I. Bill, that elevatedthe lower and middle classes.I thought I would hate it with the first chapter, whereall the chidren were starving in front of their Mother.But I continued to read and I thought of Francie, in "" A Tree Grows In Brooklyn"",and I realized I was reading a greatbook and could not put it down until I finished every page.Barbara, you are a beautiful women with a good sense of self.I don't want to give the story away,but I would ask theauthor to continue this story of her Family or treat uswith another.It shows you don't have to be great or famousto inspire people...."
4,new york bookworm,"a heart-wrenching true memoir that is almost unbelievable to imagine. how children can cope with the harshestabuse,emotionally and physically, with a mother standing by silently shows what resilience the human spirit can endure. looking forward to the sequel""fierce"""
3,What???,"Okay, I have become a Dave Stone fan, espcially of his Doctor Who books, but this also means I've become aware of his more irritating qualities. That includes his tendency to include very, very strange aliens, scene changes right in the middle of the action, and a lot of DouglasAdams-isms. D&D is probably the worst offender in the Virgin Doctor Who range (with Sky Pirates! in a dead heat), and is further hampered by having to include the improbable romance between Jason and Benny.On the plus side, the Doctor is (there's no other word for it) awesome! He's almost supernatural in this book, and I loved every minute he was on the page. Which wasn't enough."
5,very natural,"This blush is very light, but natural. I use it alone, or combine it on top of bronzers or darker blushes. It seems to blend well with most colors. Definitely a good ""basic "" to always have on hand."
4,Masters creates a stunningly beleivable post holocaust world,J.D. Masters has created a real page turner with a lot of action and excitement. Picture robocop but then give him a human heart and mind.Steele is a force for good in a post holocaust world where the remnants of civilization are seeking to be reborn anew.
1,Bad Sound Engineering,"I just bought and listened to this cd. If you want any kind of decent sound quality try to get the songs elsewhere. Some songs are stereo but except for ""The Rockford Files"" all are poorly engineered; all are flat, low fidelity, sound. For a cd printed and copyrighted in 1995, it's hard to see why they marketed this, but then someone suckered me into buying it."
1,Diamond DIsaster,Sounds like one of those toy upright pianos you had as a kid-tone is harsh...piano clanks
2,NICE PRICE BUT..........,"The price was right on this product. I received two as promised in a timely manner. One did not work, when inserted into the printer the printing was too faded to read. The other worked fine."
3,It's okay - But like The Roulette Cash Cow better,"This is a good roulette book, there are some interesting roulette systems in there, but overall, I'd have to say that I'd stick with the Roulette Cash Cow system, this one has never let me down (so far)"
2,Nice but Simplistic,"This is a book for people who have been living in the dark ages for the past twenty years. It's a sensible book as far as the nutrition chapters are concerned but it disregards a lot of the good research in the diet books it critiques. Also, the authors are too easy on those who need to face the fact that exercise is difficult but necessary for good health. Overall, the authors let the readers off too easy with regard to exercise and food choices."
2,Inovations RF adaptor,Ok if you don't have any other way to play your Genesis then buy an RF adaptor by Inovations. Other wise go with an Sv-s Cable for a better picture and quality!
3,Interview Info.,"This book is helpful if you need to know how to organize your job search and keep track of documents. It contains a list of interview questions (but that is available on the internet). Since the book is written by administrators it would be helpful if they would give an idea as to the answers administrators want to hear, unfortuneatley the book falls short in this area.The other area the book could improve on is demonstration lessons, what administrators are looking for. I am sure this varies from school to school but it would still be helpful to hear more about the demonstration lesson phase of the interview process."
2,becoming a teacher,"No, this is not what i had in mind when i purchased it. i wanted something more detailed that will help you create a resume and coverletter. the book states that it will help you, but it really doesn't it just has a sheet that recommends that you answer what you're looking for in a career, but never gives suggestions. Also it gives you many questions to expect in your interview, but no suggestions on how to answer them. all in all you have to do the work yourself and if you never taught before you really need help in this area. it even has the nerve to suggest that you talk to other teachers and such for suggestions when that was supposedly the purpose of THIS BOOK! if you're a first year teacher don't waste your time purchasing this book, you'll be disappointed."
4,good suppliment material,"Take what you want and leave the rest, this book shares some great insite into the successful job search. Although I have not taken every suggestion to heart, it has truly helped me to gain an even better understanding of the interview process and gain some knowledge into just what an interviewer may be looking for. I say it is worth having, I am satisfied."
1,Healthy? No way! Bland and oily.,"If you love Pirate's Booty, then you'll find that these Tings are exactly the opposite. Light, oil free and perfect mix of condiments makes the Pirate's Booty tasty, but the Tings feel greesy, heavy and completely bland. Do yourself a favor and do not even think of trying these if you're a fan of the other product from Robert's American Gourmet!"
5,Daughter loves Tings,"My daughter loves Tings! She is allergic to dairy so this is her alternative to Cheetos. She shares with friends and they always ask for more. I used to be able to find these at my local grocery store, but they no longer carry Tings. I was thrilled to find this product on Amazon."
1,Tings,"A curious ""snack food"" and strangely difficult to describe: If an air kiss had an actual shape, and was sprinkled with salt..."
1,I Ting I will NOT buy these Tings again!,"I was disappointed with the flavor of these. I really love the taste of nutritional yeast (I'm a vegan) but the only discernable flavor of these doodles was salt. I don't know why nutritional yeast is listed as one of the ingredients and the flavor non-existent. I think it may have been a marketing ploy to entice ""health nuts"" and vegans to buy them. It's too bad since nutritional yeast is so full of nutrients and flavor. If you are a vegan, don't waste your money!! Go makes some popcorn and sprinkle some nutrional yeast over it.... it's much less expensive and healthier than these lousy things, I mean ""Tings""."
1,Disappointed,"After reading the reviews for this item, I immediately ordered a box. I was disappointed in that although it isn't a bad item, it just lacks flavor."
3,Too Salty!,The texture and flavor of this product is wonderful. But would be even better with half the salt!
3,POPPIN' FRESH,"RADIO DAZE/POP HITS OF THE 80'S, VOL. 4-VARIOUS ARTISTS: Not EVERYTHING that came over the airwaves in the decade of excess had a new wave beat to it, thank heavens. RADIO DAZE VOL. 4 features the usual blend of country and pop ear candy, including obscure acts like Rick Pinette and Oak, and Wet Willie frontman Jimmy Hall, as well as the better known Carly Simon and Harry Chapin, whose TAXI followup, SEQUEL registers here. For cheese value, they even throw Waylon's DUKES OF HAZZARD theme and an honest to goodness Susan Anton (!) number. If you prefer your music mellow and uncluttered by a variety of artists, RADIO DAZE is a good place to turn to.RATING: THREE SOFT ROCKS"
3,More Filler than Hits,"As with the first three volumes, too many unfamiliar songs clutter the collection, and too much AC without any variation into other early 80s genres is simply too much after the fourth CD. All original versions."
2,for collectors only (solo para coleccionistas),"de la serie completa, este es sin duda el album mas debil. solo para quienes conocen temas especificos de la epoca como el de don williams por ejemplo o para los que quieren tener la serie integra de estos 5 volumenes. una lastima que no aparecieron mas. si te interesa esta epoca, consigue los volumenes de la serie ""lost 45"" del sello varese-sabarande; hay cositas bien interesantes alli, sobretodo en el vol. 1"
4,Worth the buy,We are pleased with our Exercise Bike. My husband uses the bike atleast 3 or 4 times a week and recommends it.
5,State property review,"I think that this movie was really good. It had all of the things a movie should have. It had guns, drugs, and lots and lots of money. Plus has all the members of the rocafella team in it.On a scale from on to ten i give this movie a ten. It's the best movie and you got to go see it."
1,THIS IS THE REASON RAP ARTIST SHOULDN'T MAKE MOVIES,"THIS HAS TO BE ONE THE WORST MOVIES OF THE YEAR! THIS GOES TO SHOW YOU THAT EVERY RAP ARTIST IS NOT CAPABLE OF MAKING MOVIES. THE ACTING WAS DISGUSTING, THE LINES WERE GARBAGE AND THE STORY WAS JUST AS BAD. MAYBE ALL THESE RAP ARTIST IN THIS MOVIE SHOULD SPEND MORE TIME MAKING QUALITY MUSIC OR TAKE SOME ACTING CLASSES!"
4,For What it's worth,"State Property is not an academy award winner, and non of the actors will win a statue of their work, but it is for what it's worth a decent movie. How good can a movie about drugs and violence really be, I mean Scareface was the best. Everything after that follows the same blueprint. Wannabe low level drug dealer wants to take over the industry and begins to cut everyone else out and makes too many enemies.The story stays the same, but the actors change. For a movie with Rappers playing most of not all of the key roles it is a decent movie!"
1,"Rappers, Stop Acting!","I watched ten minutes of Beanie Seagal trying to act and turned my DVD player off to read a book. I had to. I felt like I was getting dumber by the minute for watching that short segment of the movie. It looked so common I didn't even need to see the rest to tell you the end. I'm willing to bet some people got shot, somebody got away with the crime, the police arrested Beanie, and somebody's mother was yelling at somebody. I don't even care if I'm right or wrong because regardless, I'm not gonna finish watching this movie."
1,Terrible,The first 4 to 5 minutes are the best part of the movie. The acting is horrendous and the story is just as bad. If you want to watch a so called gangsta movie try Paid in Full.
1,GARBAGE,"I seen this and it was horrible. None of them cats can act if their life depended on it. Beans is 100% garbage. I would have expected the story line to be at least better than these amateur, fake actors, but I never get what I want do I? The earlier Black movies in the early 90's were classic. Belly wasn't classic but it was good...this is GARBAGE. I think Beans should stick to rapping cuz at least he's decent. The rest of those fools should work at MacDonald's or something"
2,Could have been much better,"When I watched this movie, it was nothin' more than another drug dealing movie. If they had a better idea of a story, than true events that could'nt complete a good puzzle, this would'ave made a better movie than this. And it's another one that doesn't set a positive example message ect. The rappers in this movie can't act, unless it's Memphis Bleek n' Jay-Z. Bleek should'ntave died, and Jay-Z should'ave been in there longer. And the movie is fake... That's only 2 out of all the rappers in this movie that could act. Hears the moral behind this piece, If they had a better, more goin' storyline, it would have been much better, and if they had people who could act instead of rap, this movie would'nt be so fake. If I were u, don't buy this, or rent it n' see, ..."
4,STATE Property,"this is a classic gangster movie already, anyone whos into the whole block scene should add this to their collection."
2,Why Is Black Crime More Villified Than White Crime?,"I would not encourage anyone to follow the gangster lifestyle portrayed in this movie. That said, how can people find redeeming values in movies like THE GODFATHER, SCARFACE, GOODFELLOWS and TAXI DRIVER, while STATE PROPERTY is vilified? Could it be because it portrays Black criminals while the white gangster movies glorifies white criminals and white crime? I condemn the violence and lack of ethics portrayed in this movie but the wave of condemnation this Black movie invokes is not applied when it comes to white gangster movies."
2,African American Scarface,"This movie was basically a revamp of Scarface but instead of being a cuban coke lord, the main character is a ghetto wannabe big tymer. The acting is Sub par, The plot as i said is basicaly the same as Scraface's except with alot more ebonics and bad cinimatography. The Acting is terrible. But if you are watching this movie just to see Drugs, Thugs, and Hoe's ... it's perfectit depend's what your looking for, oh an by the way Jay Z's role in this movie is a Cameo at best, an his character had no personality"
1,Strait up garbage,"This movie coulnd get any worse. Hears da ups n downsUP:It's has money, hoes, doughA so-so mottoDown:Beanie is not a great bossLike that dude said, this is basicly a african-American ScarfaceThe story is way too predictable, too much forshadowingIt's also copying New Jack City, killing the competitionThe American Dream, that's been used too muchThe get down, or lay down motto gets annoyingThe actin' iz strait up ugly n fakehell, even the blood is fakeRoc-a-fella has alot of money, and make a movie that coulda been done betta on a camcorderThe sayin' at the end is just like the words on the cover of scarfaceThis movie could be the worst movie ever"
1,BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD,"This is a really, really, really, really, bad movie. Don't watch it, don't buy , don't even think about this movie, you may get brain damage. Acting is horrible, plot line is ridiculous, and who...wrote this terrible script. Ghetto people don't even talk like that."
2,cheap cardstock does not a GM screen make,"The M&M; GM Screen is everything advertised... but it's still just terrible.Pros: All the information is there. The layout is very good and the art is lovely (for a four color comicbook supers game). The font size does leave something to be desired, but that is true of all GM Screens I've seen.Cons: When I think of a GM screen, I think of the World of Darkness Storyteller Screens. Those are as tall as a standard RPG book and have a good thickness and quality to them. The GM screen for M&M; is as thick as a standard 3x5 inch note card. The M&M; screen measures in at short 9&1/2 inches tall. Go ahead, get a ruler and see if that's the kind of screen you are accustomed to using.If the information is all you want, then by all means, pick this up and scan it in.If you want a useful GM screen though, I'd either pass on it, or scan this one and DIY a better quality screen.Overall, very disappointing."
4,freaky,"This is a great book, full of morbid humor and awesome pictures. The only thing that freaks me out is that the only child who is seen after death with an ax in her chest is Kate. Since that is my name, it's kind of scary, but the rest of the book is great. A hilarious book. Truly gorey."
5,for those few with a morbid sense of humor,i am not a cold blooded murderess. i am a mere child with a morbid sense of humor. this exceptionally good story met my gorey standards.
3,Cute,Liked it because I love Edward Gory but thought the book would be a little bit bigger. All in all it was fun.
5,G is for Greatness which Gorey did spout,"Dark, morbid, violent and creatively brilliant. This book adds humor to gore and visually brightens your day, the artwork consists of very good black ink drawings,each page has some specific death for a child in alphabetical order, such as,(K is for Katie who was struck with an axe, or, X is for Xerxes devoured by mice).Noe the fact that all these nasty things happen to children should not dissuade you, its humor people, just don't buy the book for you kids.All of Edward Gorey's book should be collected because of the artwork and the fantastically morbid story's, I know I'll be buying more."
3,G is for Gorey who laughed us to death,"This book was my first foray into the wierd Victorian-styled blackly-comedic world of Edward Gorey, and definitely got me hooked. It provides an alphabetical list, in rhyming couplets, of children dying from freak accidents, parental neglect, or their own foolishness (""L is for Leo who swallowed some tacks,"" f'rinstance). It pokes fun at the Victorian era's placing children on a pedestal by pointing out how easy it is for them to fall and possibly asks, through the absence of parents in any of the illustrations, why did people who held children in such high regard leave theirs in big creepy houses full of potential death-traps?I give it a 3 because, while silly, it's not the best example of Gorey's quirky humor. If you'd like quirky humor and wierd art without dying children, I highly reccomend The Doubtful Guest or The Epipleptic Bicycle"
3,Not What I Expected,"This book is really great and I love Edward Gorey, but make sure you look at the Product Details before you spend more than you feel you should for a tiny book. This book is crazy short. Like five words per page short. It's also about the size of a CD case. There is one illustration per page, each page has a short sentence, and it goes in alphabetical order. So 26 pages of actual content. It is a really nice book but make sure you don't spend more money than you think 26 short sentences and pictures are worth."
5,Tinies review,i was so excited to finally make this purchase. i laughed my way through the book!!! the art work is great and it is tiny enough to go in my purse!! taking it with me made easy!!!
5,"Best use of the word ""ennui""","A twisted, strange, lovely alphabet that shows Edward Gorey at his macabre best. I give one of these books to every friend I meet who understands my own bizarre sense of humor. Edward Gorey rules!"
5,Worthwhile,"Such a macabre, yet interesting and sometimes funny little book with a child representing each letter of the alphabet! I enjoyed discovering the demise of each one from start to finish."
3,morbid alphabet,"disguised as a children's read, this little book shows all the ways little people could die, from A to Z.I expected the artwork to look like the cover page but they are all black and white. He uses pen for all the illustrations, achieving many values and textures with lines, stripes, various patterns and predominately crosshatching. It's cute."
2,Too much hype.,"I had been looking forward to this product after being wowed by the demonstration on Creative's website. But unfortunately it doesn't do that well a job. It tries to enhance anything you're listening to, so alot of times it will try to make something out of nothing. They say it can make bad quality music into great quality, but it's just not happening. You can get lucky with some cd quality music, but don't think you're going to be able to watch YouTube music videos with greatly improved sound. I was thinking so, but it just distorts it, brings the wrong sounds louder, bass bigger, not really what the producer intended. The best pro I can find is that the unit itself is very good quality, along with the USB cable and pouch included. You can get lucky with some music, though. It's not always bad. If you can get one for cheap, go ahead and get one if you want, but don't pay full price."
5,Works great with Mac,I searched around for a quality USB audio adapter for the Mac. I had a hard time finding one that would sound great and work without drivers. This was exactly what I was looking for. Audio quality you expect from Creative Labs combined with driver-less installation on Mac OSX 10.6. Highly recommended!
3,"perfect in windows, bad in linux","it works perfectly in windows vista, the effect is as good as it is advertised. but it produces buzzzzzzzzzzz noise when it is working in Ubuntu Linux. Since Ubuntu is my major working OS, I have to return it for refund, what's a pity ..."
3,"Better than nothing, but don't overpay","Ordered this device to improve onboard notebook sound. It does that. Audiophiles will hate it, but it is not a device to turn your computer into a sophisticated high dollar sound system replacement; it is a device to make crappy sound bearable -- which it definitely does. If you have one of the new dells that have only the expresscard slots for which there are no compatible sound upgrade options, then this will do the trick. Definitely not worth retail though, I found mine elsewhere for $32 with google checkout. If I had paid more, I would have been disappointed."
2,Does not work,"I have owned the X-mod for well over a year and I can safely say that the x-mod does not work...or at least not the way the manufacturer intended it to.The idea behind the x-mod was the digitally fill in spaces where it thought there was missing signal in compressed music, which..it kidna does i guess. The drawback is that it doesnt do it correctly especially in the treble region. The x-mod makes cymbals and hi-hats are way too sharp and bright on most songs and distorts most of the rest of the treble region as well. On some songs....its ok and there is some slight improvement, but overall, I find the x-mod to have been a bad investment as I hardly turn it on anymore.Bryant"
2,Dysfunctional on Arrival,Beautifully packaged - Easy to use - Didn't DO much - Overpriced for what it did - My particular sample cut in and out (internal short? poor quality control for sure.)
5,Simply Works!,"Anyone that has ever owned a creative sound card before knows what a pain it is if you loose the disk that came with it to get it actually working again. Especially since they have something against putting their original drivers and software on their site! GRR! Anyway, this thing does not even come with a driver CD! You plug it in, and it WORKS! Really digging this new way they are working towards!"
5,So good I got another,Works great n my laptop that I bought another one to use in my garage/man cave system. So much better than trying to connect the headphone out to a stereo system.
5,Sounds like a winner!,"I bought a few of these for myself and for gifts. This device does change your music/sound well. I like the remote sound control from the knob, cool blue led's and fancy bag and ear phones."
5,good for 2.0 speaker and headphone,"good for 2.0 speaker and headphonework good for real music, not for some popular junks"
3,mr,"The product is fine and performs well but it is difficult to install and configure, nevertheless it produces good sound."
3,Try some winamp plug-ins before spent your money,"This product is beautifull and can help you to clean your audio, but there are better and chepest options to increase the quality of your MP3 as some winamp plug-ins"
1,line in/out,Appears most reviewers are getting good results when using this device to enhace their computer speakers via the USB connection.I purchased it to improve the sound of my compressed music when played via my MacBook Pro and Airport Express connected to my Yamaha RXV-2400 receiver and Artison Portrait speakers.I connected it between the Airport Express and the receiver (via the line in and out jacks) and it actually made the sound worse. Added distortion (sibilance) on the high end. Called the Creative Labs hotline and they offered no help. I'm returning it.
2,Not audio output for mac,Line and mic inputs were ok. but audio output never showed up.don't waste your money if you're a mac user
4,Useful little gizmo,"Installation was a breeze, no CD or drivers needed. Difference is huge with all 128 Kbps mp3's. Gives you a feeling like listening to a CD ripped at 320 Kbps. Mp3's encoded at a higher rate (192+) sound a bit too artifical. If you are using Media Player, setting 8 and 16 Khz values to -4 and -7 solves that problem."
3,it is OK,"I bought this product since my computer's on board sound microchip was broken.The quality is OK. I am not a specialist of music, so it is OK for this price.I hope this product have little more volume. it bit quiet.I personally I do not like to use effect, but I think it is good for the people who like adding effects.some of people said it has hiss noise but I do not hear hiss. It must be depend on the location of the product or computer.So far it is OK"
4,xmod makes all my music sound better,"I picked up the Xmod this week, based on a recommendation from a techie friend. He knows I don't have time to learn complex products. I just want something that works with little maintenance. The xmod does that, and does it well. I just plug it in, flip the two switches-crystalizer and cmss, and I'm done. I have a ton of MP3s, and I like hearing the subtlety of the instruments. I can hear so much more of the instruments with the Xmod turned on. I never turn it off now, there's no need to."
3,Good sound quality but...,It mutes the sound every time my computer comes out of sleep. Have to replug the USB cable for sound to come back...Very annoying!
3,Crunching sound,"I'm using Mac OS X 10.6.I noticed the sound when I was watching movies, and I turned on surround sound with Audio Midi Setup. It's an unmistakable sort of ""crunching"" noise that drives me absolutely insane. I had to disable surround sound to get rid of it.I think I may have just missed it before, because even now, with surround sound disabled, I still hear that crunching sound quite a lot. Definitely not as much as before, but stil, it's really distracting and it's not what I paid for. The sound is great, but I just hate hate hate that noise. I don't know what to do about it either! I'm listening to a song right now, and I am hearing that noise as I type this. It's maddening."
4,"Finally, a decent print!","Already had a fair-quality gray-market DVD of this ""lost"" Bava classic (as _Rabid Dog_), but was delighted to find a more legit copy here at Amazon. Sure enough, it's a better print! As for the movie, if you're a Mario Bava fan, you know this is a gem. Definitely worth the price, all the more so compared to other versions out there."
3,"Mario Bava's ""lost"" masterpiece","Being a huge Bava fan, I was eagerly awaiting this departure from horror and fantasy. It was the master's attempt at making a film about the real world and the people in it. After viewing, I think Bava nearly succeeded. Probably the best acting I've seen in a Bava film, this could be due to the fact that it wasn't dubbed. Also, the film shocked me with some incredibly brutal scenes, especially when one kidnapper forces a woman to urinate in front of him, and she DOES!!!. The twist ending was incredible and unexpected. The only real problem I had with the film are all of the little cliches that make me so irritated. For example, the kidnappers are about to fill up the gas tank to their captured car. They're about to get away and then, out of nowhere, a hitch hiker appears desperately needing a ride. And they give her one!!!All in all, if you can handle the annoyances, and the ultra-small subtitles, I think you'll enjoy this ""lost"" treasure."
5,Fungus Link,"Received this book on time. It is in okay condition. It has ALOT of writing through out the book...ALOT. However, it hasn't hindered my reading it. The outside cover is in excellent condition. I am still reading this book. BUT I do believe that fungus attributes to MANY MANY deceases. And as I read this the more it sells me on doing a fungus cleanse and eating fungus free. We atch Doug Kaufmans program every morning, this just gives alot of additional information"
4,Great book bad binding,"This is a great book and the book itself it deserving of 5 stars. The information that has been presented by Doug Kaufmann is amazing. My fiancée has had health problems for over 10 years now and has gone on the diet. She has not fully recovered but is making great strides toward recovery. I would highly recommend this book if you are not getting the results from what you have been trying. It is also good if you are just looking for alternatives to current medical practices. A warning though. It is a VERY difficult diet and not for the ""fad"" dieter. But if you want to try to get better without using all the prescription meds then this is a great option. The reason that I did not give it 5 stars is that all of the books that I have seen from this had binding issues. The binging breaks easily and the papers start falling out. Open with caution."
2,Interesting Asian cases but text doesn't resonate,"As a collection of text and cases, this book is a hotchpotch read. Important subjects are discussed in vague terms with timeworn buzzwords tossed into the mix. Further, it is not firmly established what is meant to be instructional about some of the cases vis-a-vis the chapter contents. One thing I appreciate about Global e-commerce is the use of Asian cases which offer the reader a global perspective. It's good to hear of developments that don't have much coverage in the US, but I only wish the chapters shared this focus."
3,Good Global Case Studies!,"It is difficult to find a good textbook for Global E-Commerce course. Ninety percent of the E-commerce books talk about [website],[website],[website] but nothing about companies outside of USA. Everyone treats E-commerce as American business only. This textbook, however, gives good in-depth case studies on E-commerce success stories in Hong Kong, Japan, and UK. It would be better to include more European and South American E-commerce successful war stories. The reader still needs to do his/her own research with Harvard Business Review and Cranfield University cases to gain more info. As a professor, this book allows me to add many of my own research and experience. I am using it in my course Spring 2003 semester."
1,SOVERIGNTY OF GOD,"IN HIS BOOK ""THE CREED OF PRESBYTERIANS"" E.W. SMITH STATED THAT ""EVERY HERESY IN DOCTRINE OR MORALS WORKS ITSELF FIRST OR LAST INTO A FRENZY AGAINST CALVINISM."" THIS BOOK UPHOLDS THAT FACT. THERE IS NO DOCTRINE MORE HATED BY ""THE SINFUL LITTLE POTS"" THAN THE SOVEREIGNTY AND FREEDOM OF THE POTTER."
5,Great critique of the Calvinist Doctrine,"I found this book incredibly simple to comprehend, yet insightful and convincing. This is a manageable, well-balanced read for anyone interested in a critique of Calvinism. Without name-calling (as some so-called ""Christian"" reviewers do on these webpages and thus give a very poor image of a Chrisian church in America), George Bryson presents a structured, Bible-based presentation of Calvinism's inconsistencies. Of course, anyone who believes in the Calvinist dogma might argue that Bryson's Biblical passages are taken out of context, but the same arguement can be levied against Calvinist writings. We shouldn't forget that everyone's understanding of the Bible is unique, and hence there is no need to call those who disagree with you ""heretics"", as, most regretfully, did J.W. Majors. ""Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgement, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you."" - Romans 12:3"
1,not impressed:(,not worth a $100.00 not a good book and VERY hard to get into and boring! Im a 9th grade teacher and if one of my students wrote this book I would give them a D-
5,This Wing Zero Gundam is Great,I just got this gundam and its awesome.I love the gundam Wing Zero in the show and its the same with the model kits.I love this model kit especially more than other models because it requires more skill and i have alot of skill evn though im a 9 year old.They should let 8 year olds do this-something better than watching t.v!:) I wish I had other perfect grade gundam model kits.
1,Not a GREAT Pg but a good one.......,"First of all for those who dont know of the Pg line, this model might be heavens sent but compared to the others in this line and the new one.....this model is better than the original Gundam Pg. Its difficult to build, but the end product is worth it. On the other hand if youve been modeling awhile and have another Pg youll notice that the model isnt nearly as big as the others in the line and isnt quite worth the money.....but it is a great damn model....."
2,Waste of all ya money!,"This model is definently not what they make it out to be.tooo many things can break,I really think it is really stupid that they charge $[so much money] for this this box of junk!I am not telling you not to buy it but I really don't think it's agood idea."
1,Waste Of Money And ur Time Hands Break off easily wit glue,I really dont recomend this model to any1. i followed all the instructions perfectly. and the model says it has a lock mode so it doesnt flap around but it is wobbely the hands always fall of and it takes 1 week to fully complete it with paint and everything get it if u want but i warn u dont get angry saying its a waste of money and week of building it.medal joints. that improves the model by like 10 percent the whole model is plastic.
1,Product mis- representation,"The Sky Bounce Handballs were not handballs at all. They seem to be the size of racketballs, and I did not even bother to open the package to evaluate them further when I received it. I promptly returned it for credit. Ordering this product was a waste of my time and I advise handball players not to expect the product as described by Amazon.Bernie"
4,Slightly stiff,"If you want a Cadillac ride these are not for you, but they are also better than the tooth jarring ride of ProComps monotube. I replaced worn Monroe Reflex shocks up from and Edlebrock in the rear of a Dakota, and I love that the ride is now balanced. The Edlebrocks were fine but not a good match to the worn out Reflex. My truck sits flat cornering and ride great at highway speed. At slow speeds the shock can be a little stiff on a cement road with busted seams, but they take speed bumps and dips with ease. Braking and cornering in my quad cab Dakota is so much better. These gave it it's confidence back."
2,aem clutch fluid mounting kit,"This little piece was tough to figure out. It flipped it around a few times before i figured out how it had to go. It serves a great purpose though. The directions with it are not very good. It shows a skimpy picture of the mounting piece itswlf, but not where it needs to go or which way it needs to go. Plus the mounting screws are hard to get lined up and figured out."
2,Looks nice but....,"I bought this fixture almost 2 years ago. It looks very nice and puts out a nice light, but it is in a bathroom. Bathrooms will have some humidity of course. The fixture finish corroded rather quickly It's at the point now I need to replace it because it looks so bad. I do have adequate ventilation but it hasn't kept the finish from looking so bad. After paying what I paid for this, I expected it to last longer."
3,Only good for a Dolphin fan,"bought this towel on sale for $11.69 for a Dolphin fan. It is a bit rough and thin. But for this price on a NFL item, I guess it is a deal."
4,Dolphins Beach Towel,This is a good quality towel only things are I feel it should be of thicker consistency and also wish I could purchased a face cloth of the same team with this quality. Thank You
4,Serving the Lady Maat can be dangerous.,"Lt. Bak of the Medjay police has been sent to Abu to investigate a series of murders, spaced ten days apart, each victim higher in importance than the last. Now Bak must discover the slayer before Abu governor Djehuty becomes the next victim. In a strange land, filled with fiercely held secrets, Bak must find the slayer without himself becoming a victim.Reading a Lt. Bak mystery is a journey through time. You walk beside an intelligent, interesting servant of the Lady Maat, dispenser of justice, experiencing the sights, sounds and smells of Ancient Egypt, brought to life through Haney's excellent use of language. I may have realized who the slayer was long before Bak, but it didn't detract from the wonderful story."
3,Predictable series,"This is the third book in the Lt. Bak series I've read and it is definitely more interesting than the other 2. While the author's information is researched, the plots dwell on the minute & seem to drag on. It took 200 pages of descriptions to get to the core of the story. Unfortunately her writing ability & expertise does not compare with Gedge, Robinson or Jacq on this favorite subject of anicent Egypt."
4,Police procedural in ancient Egypt,"I'm a fan of this series and enjoyed this one every bit as much as the previous books. The main character, Lt. Bak, is well rounded and likeable, as are the other ""regulars"" in the series cast (although we don't get to see too much of his right hand man, Imsiba, in this one).Some people said they found this book slow, but I'm not sure that's such a terrible thing. After all, this IS a police procedural, although set in ancient Egypt. You aren't going to have high speed chariot chases or shoot outs. It's more intellectual than that, but I still found it fast reading.I'm not enough of a historian to know how accurate the book is, but it has the ""ring of truth"" which adds to the pleasure of the novel.All in all, a good read!"
4,A little heavy handed,I like ancient Egypt and mysteries. This book is both but the style of writing is a little heavy handed and the plotting is a little slow. It picks up pace in the second third so is worth the read.
4,Good Prep Material,"No single book will prepare you for any certification exam and with what the CISSP exam costs you will want to make sure you are fully prepared. I found this book worth the money. It's a good book to start you on the path to the CISSP exam or for a final review of the subject matter. It covers all the ten domains and unlike some books, which seem to read like stereo instructions, the language in the book was clear and understandable. So get yourself several texts to study for the exam and make sure this is one of them. You will have a good head start towards passing."
3,"Cheap, complete & well-written = 3 ***","I gave this book 3 stars because it's concise, reasonably well-written and somehow complete. ISC2's exams are a b**ch because nobody really knows what stuff will be covered and what will not. Personally, I used this book as my first study material. I read that thing twice before switching to the Keutz Prep Guide + the official ISC2 book which are longer and more detailed. Questions are way too easy so they're not to be used as primers before doing the exam.To wrap things up, it's an average book with some multiple minor mistakes. It's concise but it should not be your sole source of material. That being said, as of today, I would suggest buyers invest their hard-earned $$$ toward a proven book such as Keutz's Prep Guide or Harris's All In One."
1,NEVER RECEIVED IT,"ASKING ME TO REVIEW AN ITEM I NEVER RECEIVED IS NOT GOOD FOR BUSINESS.I have told your seller a number of times via email that this item has not been received, they have told me to wait as it might take 4 to 6 weeks, we are way beyond that. Seller has not responded to my latest emails."
1,Do not waste the $24.50,This book is completely inadequate for the CISSP. The Security + Exam cram 2 was twice as big for a test half this size. I wish someone had warned me before buting this book. When I opened the package and sow how small this book was I laughed. Can I get my money back? I am not normally this harsh of a critic and I am a big fan of Exam Cram but common this book is pathetic. Buy the Security + Exam Cram before you buy this one.
5,Great list of songs,"Excuse me, Mr. Ballston Spa but MOST PEOPLE are not teens and head bangers. For those many of us who appreciate something other than smashing of guitars and yelling by banshees with orange hair, this Cd cannot be beat. Many are unavailable any other way. Great memories."
3,Unbalanced Collection,"As with the first two volumes, too much filler spoils the good stuff. And most of these songs are too AC as opposed to rock to get most people excited about them. All original versions."
5,A wonderful piece of history!,"I really loved this book.We take so much for granted, and I was happy for this powerful reminder of what is really important..... family and common decency. This story was written in a quiet and unassuming way. No extra hype was added and I so appreciated it. The true events that took place were enough for me to appreciate all that this family did. This family was sleep deprived, hard working, and always shared with others. Regardless of their own safety and comfort they did what was right and helped their fellow man, in spite of the danger.I would also highly recommend this book as a wonderful school/homeschooling resource. A lot of U.S. history for your tween aged kids and up.A simple but powerful story that will touch your heart.Kregel Publications sent me the above book for review purposes. It will allow me to keep the book. I have no other connection to and have received no other compensation from Kregel."
5,"Passionate, Poignant, and Powerful!","This is a novel for all ages, and once I began reading it, I couldn't put it down. The story, set in the early 1800s, is based on a real family and real events. It is the era of slavery, slave traders, and the beginning of the Abolitionist Movement and Underground Railroad. It is more than a story about the struggle between northern and southern beliefs, it is a story of human cruelty and also a story of human compassion and courage. I will never forget the main character, young Lowry Rankin, whose internal struggles with personal insecurity and his beliefs are just as powerful and poignant as his external struggles against slavery and discrimination. The moral principles depicted are timeless, and it is an era in our country's history that should never be forgotten. Highly Recommended!"
3,okay,"Lowry witnesses the cruel whipping of slaves and is ashamed that he did nothing to assist the abused. He makes a vow to God that he will become an abolitionist minister like his father and others that he respects. He comes face to face with many who are pro-slavery and who will stop at nothing to put a stop to abolition.While this book mentions ""young readers"" on the back, it is perhaps more appropriate for youth who are a little more mature. I won't even venture an age. Given credence to this novel is that it is based on history, upping this reader's interest."
1,Difficult to use,I find it difficult to use. Would rather use traditional toenail clipper - I find it easier.
1,BROKEN!!!!!,ONLY HAD THIS PRODUCT FOR LESS THAN 3 MONTHS AND ALREADY QUIT WORKING!! WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY!! IM REALLY DISAPPOINTED !!
2,Very LOUD,"Not quiet as advertised. Very loud, louder than most hair dryers. Pretty pink but that's all. Just ordinary hair dryer. I don't use daily, wanted to keep in office for gym (the same buliding). I paid less than $8 on sales so can't return it (because of postage)."
3,Lots of music here,"This is a fine collection of Broadway tunes including many of the best known and well loved melodies. Since some of them appear to be recorded live, the quality of the sound could be better. Also, a Broadway voice has certain qualities that are best suited to theater projection. They do not always record well. Nevertheless, this is a fine CD and one that I am pleased to have in my collection. I listen to it often with great pleasure."
1,Missing Information + lousy product,"WARNING !!! This product is not made for continuos use ! I hocked the converter to a 29 Watts consumer and it just melted in the first 3 hours ( is advertised to work up to 100 watts). The transformer heated up to the point where it came thru the plastic case and landed on my floor burning it as well. I am considering myself lucky that the house didn't light up. The seller, in my case Great Elect, told me is build to work a maximum of 2 hours and they agreed to full reimbursment which I consider a nice gesture. Conclusion: 5 stars for Great Elect as customer service, 2 stars for them not advertising the risk and ZERO stars for the product itself, I really don't see the point in having one around the house."
5,Not too shabby,"We just recently started dressing our own chickens. After the first two, it became apparent that we needed something a little heavier than the knives we were using for the work. We needed something to go through bone and tendon, but still serve as a knife edge for slicing meat. This has worked out well. There are less expensive cleavers out there, but my wife insisted on stainless. The carbon steel, which cost less, can rust. The stainless was a few dollars more, but is easier to maintain and lends itself well to disinfecting. The edge is good, and something we can maintain on our own. Other cleavers with serrations and micro-edge serrations are something we could not resharpen. I wanted something that would last a lifetime, and I think we may have found it."
4,...amazing,"I had my doubts about this record especially considering the plethora of ""Post-Rock/Electronica/ Melting pot"" of stream of consciousness tune-less records. After roughly the third listen I slowly awakened to what this band is putting forward. PAY ATTENTION TO THE SUBTELTY! A truly underrated record."
4,High Country Hero is Fun!,"I found High Country Hero entertaining and a pleasure to read. The storyline is an appealing fast tale that leaves you happy.Be sure to read the first book, The Scout. Many characters from this book are in High Country Hero."
3,Beautiful and inexpensive but missing important parts.,What they neglect to tell you is you will need the valve body or rough-in which is the stuff behind the wall that makes this thing work. So plan on spending an extra $100-120 to complete the reno.
1,Titanic,Was interesting but started very slow almost stopped readingit you could have talked a little more about who was on the ship
3,It was pretty good,"This was a pretty good account of the events of the titanic. It covered it from the time it was being built to after the sinking and why no ships came to the rescue quicker. It was a short novel, but it was good."
3,1912 version,Very interesting book. Written right after the TITANIC sank. Interesting when the information is compared to all of the information available to us now on the tragedy.
2,Titanic,An interesting and well recorded story.However I found this book heavy going.The vocabulary was very sophisticated and the sentence structure was complex.Thus I found this detracted from my enjoyment.
3,Flowery account of Titanic,"Nothing exciting in this book. But good for a free down load. Interesting as written in the style at the turn of the 20th century, If you are looking for an exciting read, this is not for you, but if you are interested in how people thought and wrote a hundred years ago, then go for it!"
1,Not as advertised!,"The picture and product number appear to be correct based upon what was shipped to me, but this thermometer does NOT contain a suction cup and is NOT for mounting on windows. It is NOT clear plastic, as stated in the description, but white plastic as shown in the picture. Mine also arrived broken, so I'm returning it. Total disappointment!"
1,"Piece of junk, wrong description",Why didn't I read the reviews???!!! This is cheaply built and does not contain a suction cup.Don't waste your money.
1,Inaccurate RH reading,I bought two of these at same time. The relative humidity is off by 10 points between the two. The hygrometer is not working properly in both.
1,Where is the suction cup??,Incredible but the Timex TX 1007 Suction Cup Wall Thermometer does not have....suction cups!!!! I would give 0 stars if possible.
5,Very good,"Looks nice, good size numbers. Very nice for the price. The ink did not washed off in rain after a while like it did in the one I had previously."
2,No Suction Cup with the Suction Cup Wall Thermometer,"item is functional, but oddly has no suction cup despite it's name. it can be hung by any hook or nail, but I planned to stick it to the window facing in. Not built for that. Lack of diligence on my part, but still, no suction cup for rear mount either. It's an adequate $5 thermometer/hygrometer."
2,WHITE NOISE !!!!,"Worth for tracks 2 and 4 only and the genial more-vitriolic-than-ever lyrics !! Crass were angry at the Falkands invasion on the part of Maggie Thatcher and put out this record which sonically matches a war.Unlistenable for the most part (and believe me, I thought I loved unlistenable till I stumbled upon this ), the songs don't even have titles. Politically, it's a 5 stars, musically........avoid unless you can get it for very little money."
1,The Environmental Case for Nuclear Power,"Robert Morris does a good job of documenting the market need for more power and the shortcomings of the current alternative energy sources. He also documents in detail the environmental hazards of coal and oil burning generators.Unfortunately, he denies the well documented history of hazards of nuclear reactors and categerozies the opinions of people who are concerned about the safety of nuclear energy as uninformed opinion of the scientifically untrained.President Gerge Bush might be swayed by Mr. Morris' arguments but anyone who is concerned about the ecological health of our planet can not take this book seriously."
1,Simple simon nuke propoganda.,"A one sided tome, missing two of the most basic facts about nuclear energy. A) The mineral, Uranium Oxide upon which today's nuclear power technology rests is depleting at the rate of between 1 and 2 percent a year. I.e. 50 - 100 year supply. (This includes all factors such as Russian missiles, etc.) B) Nuclear energy today only supplies about 8% of all world energy. Nuclear power would only last 5 to 10 years!Once they get done explaining how safe and clean nuclear power is using today's technology, when confronted with the shortage of fuel, a quick side step is taken. Expense and dangers of bomb making technology, waste disposal at 10x the rate and magic are quickly mixed up and the lesson is over."
1,INFINITE NEGATIVE STARS! THIS GUY IS HITLER INCARNATE!,"nuclear power sucks. Have you seen the movie ""The china syndrome""? That movie tells the truth. We humans are truly the cancer of the earth and our disregard for this fragile planet shows that we need to go. The development of nuclear power shows our egotism is out of control. This guy hates not just children, but,more importantly, all legitimate life on this planet as well."
5,Good Background To Nuclear Energy,This book provides a very good introduction to nuclear energy and the environmental factors. The author covers in some detail the issues of using nuclear power and the fallacies of the environmental extremists who oppose it. To environmentalist mindlessness the author provides good brain food.In particular Mr. Morris points out the down side of trying to manage without energy in a less affluent society. Anti-nuke artists might note that in the energy scarce Middle Ages acting and artist jobs were few and far between. The average peasant only saw a juggler once in a while.
3,Good if you need the space.,"I picked this up to wire aEscort Direct Wire SmartCordto myEscort Passport 9500ix Radar/Laser Detector (Black), and it did what I needed.Dealing with mini fuses is a bit of a pain, and since this is a clip that goes over one of the terminals, you may need a fair amount of patience to get this installed, if your fuse panel is recessed or difficult to access.If you're tapping multiple fuses and are careful about keeping these from shorting other taps, the 30800 taps are a great solution. However, if you're just looking to add one circuit, I think theWirthco 30103 Tapa-Circuit- Miniis MUCH easier to work with, and only costs a couple dollars more."
3,Just OK,"These do not work on low-profile minifuses, and are very difficult to use on a regular minifuse. It is a nice idea but needs to be more user friendly. Not nearly as easy to install as the photo makes it look and you have to watch out for the height of the 12VDC sticking up with the longer legged fuse plus the extension. I could not use my fuse cover after installation."
4,Good,"I do not recommend this product for use with Mini Low profile fuses, the tolerances are are very tight and there is no space for this product."
5,Patriots Towel,"This was a great price for this towel, many places they were $50 bucks or more!! Very Happy with this purchase."
1,Patriots Beach Towel,Very thin and poor quality - ordered it as a 'gift' for my son - but it has no value as a towel. Kept it as I was too lazy to return and he may get a kick out of the insignia (rapid fan!)
2,lots of tiny parts,"My boy didn't ""bond"" with this fussy little set. Lots of little bits. Nicely made but not much fun for a kid who likes to crash trucks together."
2,ezTrip - lousy fidelity,"The ezTrip FM transmitter seemed to be just what I needed for the automobile. Unfortunately, the audio quality is distorted badly on my automobile FM radio. I tried this unit in other automobiles and on the bench using a portable radio, and all yielded the same poor audio results. Am I the only one having this problem? There must be something better out there, quality wise."
3,OK,"The book was ok for the time it was published (before VCR tapes and DVD were popular) but truthfully, now days you could get a DVD which would be much better and detailed."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,Pro:I was VERY surprised at how quickly the merchandise arrived.Con:I did not know that is was a PBS television special though. I expected it to be more modern and more detailed. It was like watching and old 70's infomercial. It had some good information but was way over priced in my opinion considering it was such an old presentation. The only thing missing was Jack La Lane (or whatever his name was). Should have waited for the library copy to arrive.
2,no good,"Bought this a back up just in case something happened to my good one. It was a waste of money, even on sale. I caught my hair in it numerous times and it just generally doesn't work as well as the pricier ones."
4,Easy Target Right On Target,"This is a finely crafted, excruciatingly honest, up close and personal account of combat helicoptering in Vietnam. Tom Smith and his colleagues did things with their helicopters that I never imagined possible--and I've flown in civilian and military helicopters piloted by Vietnam vets. In the course of flying low and slow looking for sandal and bicyle tracks on the muddy trails, clearings, and jungles of Vietnam and coming to the rescue of American soldiers under fire, Smith and his crew made for one easy target.I've known the author, not well, but a long time. And I also know a thing or two about writing, having taught it and earned a living by it. This book won't bore you with jargon, impress you with macho crap, or pretend that the war was something it wasn't. If you want to get a sense of the combat, the combatants, and the times, this is a very good place to start, or continue."
4,The characters are so real;especially if you work with one.,"I had the privilege to read this book in manuscript form. One of the main characters is Wolfman, who now teaches high school in California to at risk teenagers. I loved the entire experience and felt I actually knew Adam Smith. If you served in VietNam or did'nt you'll find this a riveting account of the terror, fear and heroics of the men flying helicopters during the War. Four stars!"
1,Don't even think about it,"I'm sorry I can't give this product a Zero rating, it doesn't deserve a 1. This is without doubt the most frustrating, unfriendly, useless software I have purchased to date for the Mac. I'm a longtime Mac and Bible software user. This truly is an outrageous contribution to the fine Mac products and continues the steady decline from this company. Recommendations? Just use the Blue Letter Bible online!"
1,More of the Same,"I am new to mac but veteran to Bible software. I live in the word and am very disappointed my new mac and quickverse will not cooperate. I was able to get a daily devotion to show on opening screen, but for the price of the black box edition you would expect more. Maybe more negative publicity will turn some heads. In the meantime, living by bread alone.Spiritually hungry in the South"
1,Terrible Don't Buy This,"Help screen does not work, tech support said to use the manual on the CD instead. What a total pain... If I could get my money back I would. This thing isn't worth the price of a blank CD. If I could rate it zero stars I would."
2,No NIV/NASB,"While I was interested in the product, it did not have either of the translations that are used in most contemporary services. I returned the product as a result."
3,This How to Book is not for an Amatuer,"This book does provide some very useful information, but I found myself reading sections over several times to get an understanding of some of the terminology. It does provide a good outline of what steps to follow to restore a hardwood floor that had been covered by carpeting for quite some years (this was my project). Two things that I believe would have made this book better are more illustrations providing examples and a glossary to serve as a reference for some of the terminology used. Overall, the book does provide very helpful information and definitely got me going in the right direction to restoring my mother-n-laws hardwood floors."
1,THIS CD SUCKS DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY YOU'LL BE SORRY !,MAN I DONT KNOW MAN I USE TOO HAVE LOT'S OF RESPECT FOR SALSOUL THEY WERE GREAT ON LP RECORDS BUT A LOT OF SO CALLED RE-MASTED LP-TO-CD MOVE IS NOTING BEING DONE RIGHT IN MOST CASE'S YOUR BETTER OFF TRACKING DOWN THE SONG'S ON LP. MAYBE ON E-BAY THEN YOU PUT IT ON CD'S YOU HAVE A BETTER SHOT OF GETTING QUALITY ALSO JUST RIGHT DOWN THE NAMES OF THE SONG'S YOU WANT OFF THE COVER THEN GO GET THE REAL DEAL IT WILL PAY OFF IN THE LONG RUN THEN YOU CAN REALY ROCK THE JOINT RATTER THEN THEM TOSSING ROCK'S AT YOU ! P.S. BELIEVE ME I BEEN DJ-ING FOR OVER 30 YEARS I ROCKED LP'S 45'78' TOO CD'S HO YA !
4,I enjoyed it!,"I'm a 28 y/o male who loves electronic music. I'm also a fan of Carol Williams (very rare for my age group) b/c of her track 'Love is You' (of which I already own several mixes.) Through her, I discovered this album on iTunes and bought a few of my fave tracks from that.The quality sucks to no end, and I have to pratically turn my volume on my iPod up to 80% to hear it clearly on my headphones.But regarding the tracks themselves, they're great! This is a modern and more hi-energy twist to some of these Salsoul classics. I really enjoyed what they did with 'Love Break', 'Love is You', and 'It's Good for the Soul'- my fave tracks on this release and I can't stop playing them when I'm at the gym or even just at the office.I would not recommend buying these from iTunes as the quality is just disappointing. Not sure if the physical CDs are any better, but in my experience, they are. I do recommend it anyway."
5,Arrived before i expected!,"I've used these wraps before. I just didn't purchase them on Amazon. They're perfect as far as Mexican-Style wraps are concerned. Identical lengths and durable. No problems here and delivered before i expected to receive them. The underside has ""This side down"" on it, which i find useful, so you don't go through all the motions of wrapping & find the velcro hold upside down. I have large hands and these wraps are fine. I'd recommend these wraps and this company any time!"
1,Not what i wanted...,"I bought this ones hopping to be the ringside 180"" mexican style hand wraps, they sent me a 120"" top contender black hand wraps, so not happy with this at all."
4,good movie,I enjoyed watching this movie can't wait for the next film!!! My friend an I watched it numerous times. Seeing characters we've read about was great.
4,Amazing Independent Film,"For Brenda Jackson fans, this is a home run! This film did something that is rarely done in big budget productions...it stuck to the original book. Perhaps that is the advantage of self-production. Congratulations Ms.Jackson!!! I for one am anxiously waiting on your next film endeavor. (The Midnight Hour or Unfinished Business would be phenomenal!)"
4,Truly Everlasting - Independent Movie,I am a fan of Brenda Jackson and I have read the book as well as own the DVD of the movie. This movie stayed very true to the storyline of the book it did not change anything and I for one enjoyed it for that very reason. You see a while back BET was turning Arabesque novels into movies and they had included another one of Mrs. Jackson's books which happened to be my all time favorite book One Special Moment and they change the storyline which then ruined the movie for me. It is important that the movie stays true to the book just like Truly Everlasting did. Good movie and I am looking forward to more by Mrs. Jackson.
4,Enjoyed the Video,"I really enjoyed this movie. I read as many books by Brenda Jackson as I can get my hands on! :) My copy (and perhaps it was just due to tight budgets), has some sounds issues and although I've tried watching on different TVs the result is still the same... It's just a little choppy and at times very difficult to hear - but I completely understand budget restraints and simply enjoy that one of her books was able to be made into a movie! :) My only critique would be that I feel like Felicia's character is a little to 'fake'... She's definitely a feisty character in general but I didn't feel like the actress delivered a totally believable performance. But hey! It's just my opinion and what do I know?! I'm definitely not an actress. Haha. Overall I really enjoyed the characters coming to life!"
4,Truly Everlasting - Nice Beginning,"I have been a Brenda Jackson fan for many years and I can truly say I am proud of Brenda in her accomplishments of doing this movie. It's not easy to do. I know the budget was tight, but she brought out some good qualities in this movie. For a first time at it, I commend her work. I bought the DVD and plan to watch it again. I know some comments were negative, but having a son in the music business and seeing what all goes into this type of business, you have to walk in her shoes first. Everything is not smooth sailing working on a project like this. It takes dedication, thick skin and alot of hard work. Money is an issue as well. Consider that the next time you comment. Just ask Tyler Perry. Brenda, congratulations on your first project and I hope to see more."
2,Disappointed,I am a HUGE fan of Mrs. Jackson and I loved this story BUT I did not like the movie or the actress who played Felicia!!!The emotional scenes were horrific! She ruined the movie for me! I imagined the Madaris Men in my mind and when they showed the uncles picture once I again I was highly disppointed. Im sorry to write this review but I purchased the movie extremly excited but after watching it once I gave it away to another fellow Brenda Jackson Book lover.
2,The movie looks good but is subtitled.,I don't like movies with subtitles.I only watched part of it. The picture was good and it looked interesting to me..
1,Beware,"I decided to purchase this oil stabalizer for my diesel engine. I added as directed during an oil change. When I started the engine the next morning I noticed it sounded different and seemed very sluggish. The engine started the same everyday with the different engine noises. When the engine was warm I did not notice any change, but when cold it just didn't sound right. After 1000 miles I took my truck in and had a oil system flush and oil change. My engine was back to normal and sounded much better. I do not recommed this product in diesel engines."
2,The jury is still out; but so far there are good results.,"I have not experienced any negative effects using the Lucas oil stabilizer. I was have issues with the oil in both of my cars burning off and lowering my engine oil level. I started using Lucas, first cut in half to split it between both vehicles because i wanted to see how they would react. Now I'm using it full strength every other oil change and they run like champs. I've cut down on the oil loss between oil changes and it's great. I have not experienced any foaming or frothing like it is proposed in another review.I'm going to continue to use Lucas to solve my oil burning problem and keep this updated with the results.Update: I had to discontinue use. I believe that it caused a valve cover failure and extreme oil leak and moisture to accumulate inside the engine block. (Or at least that is what I think.)"
1,What!!!!!!!!!,I don't even think this cd shoul be in buisness. It is weird and there is no sense of it. that's all
5,SOUL GROUP CLASSIC,"PHILLY SOUL AT IT'S FINEST, I LOVE THIS CD! THE ARRANGEMENTS BY THOM BELLWERE OFF THE CHAIN,I COULD NEVER REPAY YOUR LOVE WAS A BLUE LIGHTS IN THE BASEMENT CLASSIC ,EVERY SONG WAS SMOOTH AS SOFT BUTTER,WHY DON'T WE GET MUSIC LIKE THIS NOW FOLKS ,GOOD STUFF FROM ANOTHER SUPER SOUL GROUP FROM THE 70'S........TIMELESS"
1,QuickVerse Mac White Box a Waste of Money,"QuickVerse White Box runs okay with Mac OS 10.3.9 (Panther), but will not run with Tiger or Leopard. Installing their recommended updates did nothing to improve this situationQuickverse Mac Bible Study 2007 White Box. I submitted a problem submission form to their Product Support about this problem. I got no response - they completely ignored me. This company that sells Christian software certainly runs their business in a very Un-Christian manner. Don't waste your money on their products."
4,"Nice, but keep it clean!","This tip looked awesome when I first welded it on, but if you don't take care of it, it ends up looking a little bit less rad. You definitely want to wash it off daily in the winter in a salty road environment. It still retains a small bit of luster and looks way better than the stock tips on my 2002 Sunfire, but let it be known that you will spend a LOT of time taking care of it if you expect it to look like the picture for an extended amount of time. I knew this going in and opted for the less time-consuming ownership of letting it look ""loved"" and ""treasured for what it is now"" haha."
2,"Lots of tech, not much action","The title of this book ought to be ""The Technical Development of Radar and the Men who Were Responsible."". The first 2/3 of the book are dedicated to a plethora of names and the background of radar development in both England and Germany. It is interesting in its own right, for sure, but at times is tedious. The raid itself, as daring and romantic as it was, is given only superficial coverage, with no depth or suspense. This is due I'm sure to the no-nonsense English writing style of the author, who was an English soldier himself. Not a bad read, but more for the technical-minded than the war/history/action buff."
2,Raid! What Raid?,"I couldn't agree more with the review written by Doug Hutchinson. This book is certainly mistitled for it is not about the raid at Bruneval but a technical history of radar and its applications in war, period. As that it is good; as a story of a raid it is quite poor."
5,"What can I say about Kevin, he honored me!","I happened to meet the writer 4 years ago during an english course in England. In those times, I assume that ""JJ"" was already living in his mind and I have been delighted by the result. I enjoyed the novel, and i liked the way that Kevin seems to trully understand the thin line between being a professional, even if you are a killer, and acting humanely.Kevin, hope to be invited to your second hit again.The Real Lo Bello."
3,"Needs more action, less talk","A hired killer known as JJ finds that someone in a government agency that employs him has ordered hits on various persons with whom he is involved. He suspects that he is on the list, too, and sets out to find and eliminate its author. The book starts out well but bogs down in pages of rumination and conversation, as JJ tries to extract information of various sorts from those he believes will lead him to his ultimate prey. This sort of escapist yarn needs to move a lot faster to keep my interest, and I finally set it aside about three quarters of the way through. I didn't even read the last page to see what becomes of JJ."
4,Film Production Management 101 Review,"From what I have already read from the book, it seems to be a clear and understandable read, not to mention the content is professional and applicable to the subject matter. In other words, this book was not written by amateurs. They have had experience in this field, and this becomes useful for the reader, especially for college students who want to get into this field. Great buy and it came highly recommended by my Video Productions Management professor!"
1,Phony military awards by author,"The following is stated on the cover of Gary Linderer's books: ""...Gary A. Linderer... ""earned two Silver Stars, the Bronze Star with V device (for Valor), the Army Commendation Medal with V device, and two Purple Hearts...""This author (a private) in Vietnam, has consistently claimed to have earned two Silver Stars and two Purple Hearts, all for the same day's combat in Vietnam. He used these high honors to enhance his professional reputation and credibility as an author and his fitness to be consulted as an expert on LRP operations. Records by a FOIA request from the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, MO., clearly refute Mr. Linderer's silly, wild and phony claims. Because Mr. Linderer has lied about his medals, according to the NPRC records, then readers have to view everything Mr. Linderer writes in his books with a skeptical eye."
5,SIX SILENT MEN Book Three,"I had read Gary's Books THE EYES OF THE EAGLE, & EYES BEHIND THE LINES, so I knew when Gary sent me this book that I would enjoy it.I have met Gary and he is the type person that you just know that every thing he wrote in all his books are the truth, and nothing but the truth.I thank him for putting me on to some other books. I have really enjoyed reading his works. I would recommend that anyone who hasn't read all his books, and the other two books of this series seach the book stores for them, or if they are reading this order them from Amazon.com. Thats the easiest way to get them. Thanks Gary. Roadrunner 6 out."
3,JIFFY POP!,"RADIO DAZE-POP HITS OF THE 80'S VOL.5: A tone-kool mix of adult contemporary pop from the 80's, (though it will hardly leave anyone ""dazed"") the fifth installment from Rhino's reissue series contains the usual handful of guilty pleasures. Former Eagle Randy Meisner rocks country style on HEARTS ON FIRE, saxman Grover Washington and soulman Bill Withers blend seamlessly on JUST THE TWO OF US, and ex-Dwight Twilley Band belter Phil Seymour unleashes a power-pop smack-down on PRECIOUS TO ME. Psuedo-new waver Donnie Iris, Canada's April Wine, and raspy-but-right Kim Carnes are other all but forgotten artists who round out this sampler for the mellow party programmer in you.RATING: THREE HAVE A NICE DAZE"
5,Play it over and over!,"I love this cd so much, I have practically worn it out! The music is truly inspirational, and the Daystar Singers are incredibly talented. It is my favorite CD."
3,Bittersweet Box Set,"It's great to have all of these Mario Bava titles in one set. The transfers are really beautiful, and a revelation to those of us with memories of grainy 16mm TV prints. ""Black Sunday's"" monochrome atmosphere looks particularly lush in this set. ""Kill Baby Kill"" is a major upgrade to the crummy, desaturated DVD I have from Image.But they really SHOULD have included BOTH US and Italian versions of the star attraction, ""Black Sabbbath"". Or at least cut in Karloff's actual voice to the Italian version! Why not re-edit the way it should be? I still rushed out to buy this set, but cannot give it five stars due to the pre-release publicity which stated BOTH Black Sabbath versions would be in the box set. Anchor Bay owes all of us an apology or a free DVD of the English version."
3,A bit of repetition,"I love Cusco's music, but I believe this CD is a ripoff of the consumer, because half of the music is new and half of it has already appeared on other CDs. Also this is their attempt at Celtic music and it doesn't work as well for them as the Inca influence on their others, and the North American Indian influence on Apurimac III. This is their weakest CD, and I would suggest instead Apurimac, Apurimac II and Apurimac III, and then their others."
5,Nice bag,"At first I thought this bag is too expensive, but when it is on sale, it's so worth of every penny you spend. Lightweight and durable, easy to clean, so many dividers, sonvenient to use. I recommend this to everyone!"
5,ANYONE who writes any Perl should buy this,"I am a professional UNIX admin, and often do contract work.I carry the UNIX, Network, and Perl CD bookshelves in my laptop case so I still have access to 15+ incredible books on the road.Well worth the money!"
1,Defective Product,The jump starter I purchased would not hold a charge. I am returning the product even though it has been more than 30 days since I received it. Hopefully Amazon will replace the old one.
1,Low quality battery,Had this battery for a couple of years and now it has stopped working as several others report. Evidently SChumacher has a low quality product and poor customer service so I won't bother to ask for their assistance.
1,More Garbage From China,Just sent back the second defective unit. Schumacher said they never recieved the first one I returned and I received the replacement a day later (their record keeping leaves a lot to be desired). The replacement was also defective! I bailed out and asked for a refund. Made in China-Beware.
5,Great buy,"I no longer had this product a week and I have used it 4 times. Worked great everytime. Christmas shopping can be trying but when you come back out to your car and the battery is dead, you don't want that. 4 people reaped the benifits of my prior planning. They all said they are going to buy this product. Sells itself."
1,STOPPED WORKING AFTER 1 CHARGE.,"Simply it doesnt charge anything and the battery status says its fully charged. I have tried everything. It just doesnt work after barely any use. I bought it in April 2009 and used it once. Then, the next time (6cyl. Vehicle) it didn't do anything. A friend had a snapon battery charger and upon connecting, the car started immediately. So, its not my car battery. Will be trying to get this replaced. I will update on the replacement process."
3,Mixed thoughts,"It works great on my 8-cylinder Corvette Z06, but won't start a 6-Cylinder Jaguar X-type. Go figure...new batteries in both now anyway."
2,TOO expensive,"It seems like cheap you save around 50% off, but still $90 because of docking station come with.Basically I like product but I do not like current price and docking station is no meaning."
2,Help !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I received the Jump start for Christmas last year and have tried to use it twice with no luck. Can anyone tell me the proper way to hook it up. I can't find my booklet for it ? Thank you. ""Frustrated."""
4,Great Product,"This product works great and with the charging cradle is always fully charged and ready for action. The clamps could be of better quality, but other then that it is a great product."
4,Great book,"Another very informative book about the people, their lives and trials to survive and go through the troubling times. So many details I wonder how they did it and if we would be strong enough to handle the hardships they had."
1,Defective Ink Heads,"The printer works fine most of the time. I have not had any of the problems the other folks have talked about.However, I have had three ink heads go bad. The first one I just thought it was a fluke, and replaced myself. At 65$ I was not happy.The second one failed and I called HP and talked to a tech on India. Besides the language issue, he did well, and they sent me another ink head.I purchased a third one, since I needed the printer before the one HP was sending me was to get here.That one just failed, so I am on my third. I am going to call HP and get another ink head.At this point it is about time and aggravation.The ink is not a bargain either. At this point, I wish I had purchased a laser printer.Or anything else for that matter. I am a small business, and this is really aggravation I do not need."
1,Horrible,"HP should stay out of the printer business. This is a prime example of poor R&D, and just pushing a product out to make a buck. Never had a good experience with an HP printer. I am in the IT field, so I have a lot of experience dealing with these buggers."
1,"Have you seen ""Office Space""?","If you have, then remember what they did to the fax machine. That's how I feel about this product. The printed page looks good when you get them and it prints fast, and that's where the good ends. Tricky to install, tricky to impossible to decipher, and have had nothing but incomprehensible trouble with making it work. Not worth it at all, unless you want to hate your printer."
1,Avoid the HP Officejet Pro K5400,"We purchased this printer to serve a small appraisal office. The item is designed so it cannot print at all if even one of the color cartridges is empty. Shortly after warrenty the printer began registering ""empty"" even after installing a new ink cartridge, effectively putting us out of business until we can replace it with something useful from a reputable company."
1,Don't buy HP,"This unit worked just fine until one day it just quit for some unknown reason. Knowing that I would probably be on the phone with HP for quite a while, which I was too busy to do, I shut the unit down and used my other printer. It stayed dormant for quite a while until the day came when I had time to call HP for help.HP TOLD ME THAT THE PRINTER WAS OUT OF WARRANTY BY THREE WEEKS AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT TALK TO ME UNLESS I PAID SOME $40 OR SO !!!! I refused of course.I now own a very expensive boat anchor. And with a whole new set of HP inks.I will buy a Brother color printer now SINCE BROTHER OFFERS LIFETIME TELEPHONE SUPPORT ON THEIR PRODUCTS. AND I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM HP AGAIN !!"
2,great if you leave it on all of the time,"The printer is fine if it is left on all of the time. If not, then be prepared for a lengthy and really noisy start up sequence, lasting for minutes upon minutes and then a couple of misprinted pages until it begins to work. In its favor are the individual ink supplies, but on the other hand, if you only want to print black ink on a page, as for text, it will not function unless all colors are in adequate supply."
1,Ink hog,"I bought this printer because I was told it has the lowest cost per page printed (about 1.5 cents per page). That is absolute hogwash! After about 100 pages printed in draft mode black only, it ran out of yellow ink. About 50 pages later it ran out of magenta ink. Aparently it uses color ink for head cleaning and when printing in black mode only. It stops printing when you are out of any color ink. After about 700 pages printed (draft mode, black only) I am on my third color combo pack at $39.99/pack. That is 17.14 cents per page for color cartridges only and not the 1.5 cents I was told. If I add the cost of the black cartridge, the cost is over 20 cents/page. This printer is an ink hog and I would not recommend it to anybody! HP is laughing all the way to the bank when someone buys one of these printers."
2,HP Fail,"This printer takes about 10-15 minutes to warm up and align. Once you send pages to print, it clicks and clacks all over again and then you wait some more.Also, this printer is extremely loud. Don't print anything if you have a cat in your lap, unless you want to get shredded when they freak out and run away!I mostly print in draft mode to save on ink consumption. I will go back to buying Lexmark printers in the future."
1,After warranty expires- printer goes DOWNHILL,"Do not buy this printer. It worked fine for about a year then it started grabbing 2-3 pages at a time not to mention it jammed at least 1-2 times a week. I work for a company that uses some of the best grade paper so it can't be blamed on low quality paper. In fact, we bought 3 of these printers and the other 2 had so many problems, we just threw them in the dumpster after about 15 months. I will be discarding my printer just as soon as I use the current cartridge of ink up and will definately go with another brand!Another complaint is that all 3 printers were set on black print only but somehow this printer contiued to use the other colors and had to replace them every so often."
2,K5400 Quality Problems,"My experience with this printer can be summarized as ""horrible"". Within its warranty period, HP has replaced the entire unit twice (the first time with an equally but differently defective unit) and replaced the black+yellow print head, three times. Each of the 4 calls to HP technical support lasted over an hour. (#1 black print nozzles clogging continuously, #2 replaced bad print head with another bad print head, but decided to send new printer instead, #3 replaced black print head again, #4 new printer has paper feed and head alignment problems). When it is working, it is reasonably fast, and the print quality is good. However, it does spend an inordinate amount of time and ink adjusting and aligning itself. The network model I have, also crashes about once a month and has to be unplugged and plugged back in before you can use it again."
2,HP K5400,"I've had the HP K5400 for several months now. I am disappointed in two things, it seems to eat ink, I'm always running out of one color or another. I'm just a home uses so I don't do a lot of printing. Second when I've run out of one color and want to switch to just black, it won't let me do so unless I replace the empty cartridge."
3,Lowest ink cost of ANY desktop printer!,"Bought this printer ten months ago and have run more than 50,000 pages through it. So far it has been a very economical business printer, but now a few issues are causing me to reconsider the value.1) The ""cover open"" message frequently appears when no cover is open. This pauses printing and requires input to resume. No set it and forget it.2) The duplex unit has never worked well. It constantly misfeeds paper at about a 10% rate. Very frustrating, costly, and time consuming.3) The cyan printer head is gone and new ones run about $60. The black & yellow will probably need replacement soon, also.I like the low cost for ink, especially since I installed an aftermarket continuous-feed system, but will have to decide if it is worth spending $120 to replace this 5400 with a new one."
3,Good printing quality but a little slow,Printer is a little too bulky and prints slowly in comparison to other HP printers. Print quality is good. HP claims that printer saves on printing cost because of the multiple ink wells. Printer arrived without a cable causing another week of delay to set up the printer.Choose another printer. Nothing special about this one!
3,Colors not true,"I am disappointed in my HP K5400 Officejet Pro Color Printer. The output is fast, but the colors are not true. There is a dullness and no mater how you adjust the color balance, the colors are distorted."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER,"This printer is very noisy and has caused me two years of agony. Constantly telling me the lid is open when it is not, damaged printheads expensive to replace. Save your time and your money."
1,Horrible Printer,Got 1 printer DOA. Advance replacement was sent out and it was DOA as well. Both had issues with ink. Throw your money in the trash because it will be put to better use than by buying this printer.
4,Great Inkjet,"For the price this printer is great, it is very fast and does not appear to be an ink hog. The only thing that some may not like is, it is very noisy"
1,One star is still too many,Read the reviews below. I'm not sure what happened to HP consumer products. Not only are they now shoddy but HP assumes consumers are suckers: they'll pay anything for ink and accept any bad product.Tom Morris
3,Takes getting used to,"This 2 CD set contains Loudness' current album, Dragon, and the previous one called Ghetto Machine. If you haven't heard from Loudness since 1990 or so, well you're in for a surprise. Akira Takasaki is the only original member left and has opted for a more heavier, slower sound with this lineup. The songs are kinda hit and miss, Dragon I think being the better of the two discs. And the one weird thing is, there are songs where Akira doesn't solo AT ALL! Some of those songs needed some his shredding--badly. When he *does* solo it's great, but again not enough of it...Akira, the new sound is fine, just more lead guitar please! Have to disagree with the other reviewer, this is NOT the best Loudness album ever--IMHO Disillusion or Thunder In The East are better candidates for that honor."
1,Bad Handles,"The handles are poorly designed. They unfasten, but only drop down a few degrees, so the unfasten feature is of no use. A metal rod inside one of the handles broke when I was lifting the chair over a curb. I was very luckly my wife was not injured.The reason I purchased this chair was because of the larger rear wheel. That part of the chair worked very well as comparied to chairs with smaller rear wheels on uneven surfaces."
3,"A Hard,But Helpful Read.","A hard book to read, but very helpful for those seeking help with the religious dilemma the Vietnam War caused. It is helpful to have a Bible to read along with the book unless one is knowledgeable of scripture."
2,Too Much Repitition,I slogged my way through this lengthy book. But there was entirely too much space spent on the many paragraphs depicting Fleurs fear of Adam and Adams unrealistic devotion to Sybil. Tell me once but not 30 or 40 times. I am not stupid. Skip this one and buy one of Ms. Baloghs Simply Series.
4,An Intense Read,"A Regency about a young innocent woman running from a covetous relative, forced out of desperation to sell herself into prostition on the streets of London. How could she know that she'd pick exactly the right person for her first customer, or rather, that he would pick her? Later hired by an unknown benefactor as his daughter's governess, she's shocked to discover it's the one man who knows about her past. But she doesn't understand what he now wants from her. Will he force her to become his mistress - the mistress of a married man?This book is an intense, rather heavy read with complicated characters and a hero with a bit of a martyr complex. I found the man almost too good, but he was someone you'd want at your back. The heroine was smart and independent. The story didn't dumb the characters down, nor obviously force situations to work a certain way. I felt the pain of their impossible love and was glad it was a romance, and would therefore have a happy ending!"
4,"The Secret Pearl, Mary Balogh","It is a marvelous story and one of those which I have read multiple times. However, after the first reading I tend to skip those pages which do not have the H/h interacting. I particularly like the last sixty pages or so and these are the pages which I read again and again, mainly because here is when Fleur has finally come to her senses and begins to trust Adam. I`m a bit impatient with her distrust with Adam despite all his clear effort at making up for all that happened between them during their first encounter. And this lasts throughout three quartres of the story. However, this novel is a keeper for me."
3,Classic Tear Jerk Regency,"For someone looking for the CLASSIC regency romance. Poor girl in peril from dastardly villian is rescued by powerful and dynamic lord. Yet...with a twist. Characters are fully fleshed with their own ideas and issues and still they tie together for a enjoyable story with the perfect happy ever after. It's hard to believe at times that they will ever rise above the soap opera of hateful wives, wicked family members and their unorthodox first encounter but ...they do. Excellent from cover to cover."
1,The Secret Pearl,"I am a big Mary Balogh fan, but The Secret Pearl was truly awful. If this had been my first Balogh book it would have been my last."
3,Story was great.....book fell apart while reading it,Story was great.....book fell apart while reading it. Cover fell off and pages fell out. But I did enjoy the story.
1,Don't bother,"This book was extremely drawn out, and respective. The first 250 pages are nothing more than the hero being feared, and the heroine being afraid. I didn't even purchase the book off of amazon, but wanted warm anyone before they wasted their money."
1,Yuck!,"I'm sorry, many people enjoyed this book but the beginning ruined it for me. I don't think any male is as oblivious as he appeared to be of her situation. All that he did could not make up for the way he violated her. I still have the book but will never open the cover again!"
1,"It was just average, unfortunately",I think Mary Balogh straggled with this one. It just was not in her style. Poorly written. Very weak imitation of Jane Eyre.
1,This heroine is too dumb to live,"I know a lot of people love this book. They think it romantic that the heroine overcomes a life of prostitution (one time? Please!) and that the hero is so upstanding and gallant. What they don't tell you is that for the first 200 pages of this book, the heroine is a whining, simpering idiot who is honestly too dumb to live. She shudders in revulsion when the hero touches her from a choice that SHE made. Did she ply her services as a prostitute? Yes. Did he rape her? No. Was she paid accordingly--and even three times what she asked for? Yes. End of story. No need to whine about it. But whine she does. Endlessly. Her stomach roils whenever our gallant hero comes near her, let alone touches her. More than halfway into the book that's still her sentiment. And that does not a romance make, no matter how sweet the ending."
3,Worse than many of the reviews!,"I was very eager to read this story however I had to skip a few dull, boring paragraphs/pages throughout the book. I've just finished the book and I'm glad I did it because if I had to read one more sentence beginning with ""how the Duke touched Fleur, how sore she was or how horrible and scarry he was""It sounded to me as if married Duke lacked of courage and backbone, His wife was shallow and selfish etc. Those parts were totally annoying in Secret Pearl. Duke (Adam) was probably the most boring character ever.All I can say that most have rated this book highly i.e. 5 stars, I am one of the few minority. The book is very very slow moving (Borrow it from the library)"
3,"A big disappointment, but I got through it.","Okay, I was so excited when I bought this book. But I couldn't really get past the fact that the heroine was repulsed by the hero for 3 quarters of the book. I understand how their relationship got off to the wrong start. But when you look at everything he did for her, you would think she would have started having warmer feelings for him sooner. Even at the end of the book I felt like the dialogue was all wrong. I was hoping this book was up there with ""Whitney My Love"" (Judith McNaught), but I was seriously disappointed."
2,I couldn't get over the event at the beginning of the book,"Sorry! I have to give this book a poor rating. In the past, I've somewhat enjoyed Mary Balogh as a writer and was hoping this would be good based on the good ratings seen here. However, I was very disappointed. FIRST, this book is a re-release of an earlier book. SECOND, if you don't enjoy the whole ""rape""-type encounters which were prevelant in the 1980's Romances, don't buy this. The first encounter of the two main characters at the beginning of the book was SOOO distasteful that I couldn't finish. I really tried to get past it, but I couldn't stand the male lead after that. YUCK!!!This book is going straight to the used bookstore for trade-in!!"
3,A nice romance novel,"The book grabbed me from the first page. I was really enjoying the story and romance building between hero and heroine. The love scenes were done tastefully.But the book was predictable. After reading that heroine was hired as a governess, I knew already how the book will end. I was not surprised at the events that were taking place."
5,My Favorite book,"I am a book fan of Mary's books. Eventhough the last ones (Simply Series) did not stand up to her standards, I still enjoy pretty much everything she writes. I love the fact that the characters actually have depth to them. Fleur is a ral person, who just doesn't fall in love in the with the guy the moment she sees him. There are obstacles to their relationship. Read it and you will not want to put in down."
4,deep dark acid slammin' trance grooves,"A really good 2 disc set if you are tired of the same old dreamy trance. Anthony Pappas is amazing; good track variety and it's not all mellow like most trance is. I really liked the last 3 tracks on the first disc; my favorite being ""moments of space""; the game Command and Conquer comes to mind. The second disc is more acid driven; especially as you approach the latter half of the disc. I got this and Digweed's GU14 Hong Kong; and they go together perfectly; both dark although Digweed is a bit more mellow. If you like hard pumping acid-driven trance I'd highly recommend this disc."
5,unforgettable suspense,I did not have to read this story as a class novel and so I loved the suspense and horror that much more. This is the first story I have read by this author and I can't wait for her next one.
5,this was a awsome book,"I thought that this book was great, I have read it seven times. I thought it was full of suspence and the ending was great. I was really impressed with how this book was written. I am 18 years old and I still love to read itl. I think any one of any age should read this book!"
2,hard to get into and very unrealistic,This book did not apeal to me at all it had a very bad ending and I was very dissappointed as it was suppossed to be a good book.
1,DVD was completely empty -,DVD received was completely empty. I contacted seller and complained to Amazon and as of yet have not received another DVD. It is pathetic and really poor service on the Amazon part.
2,"No ""humerous little closings""","My children LOVE Uncle Wiggily stories but showed a mysterious disinterest in this book which I could never explain. Recently I brought home from the library the ancient ""Uncle Wiggily and the Littletails"" which I hadn't realized contains all these stories. Comparing stories from each I discovered that this Dover edition is missing the ""humorous endings"" from each story, which my children cherish. Odd for an edition advertised as ""unabridged"". Even more ironic that the introduction to the Dover specifically mentions how those endings are a favorite feature of the stories. Also the illustrations are nothing compared to George Carlson's."
3,Cute Little Stories,"Not as fun as the ""original"" Uncle Wiggily stories from when I was a child, but along the same lines and my children enjoy them. I have my book from the 1960's that my Great-Grandmother read to me, and my children loved it so much they wanted more! We bought this book to continue the fun. The stories are sweet and keep the kids entertained."
3,Average Magoo Special from 1970,"Mr. Magoo has had a lengthy career from theatrical cartoons in the 1940s and 50s to three different TV series: ""Mr. Magoo"" (1960), ""The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo"" (1964) and ""What's New, Mr. Magoo"" (1977). There was also a theatrical animated feature ""1001 Arabian Nights"" (1959) and a lousy live action film starring Leslie Nielsen. Sandwiched between all of this were a couple of primetime TV specials, one which is excellent ""Magoo's Christmas Carol"" (1962) and one not so excellent ""Uncle Sam Magoo"" (1970). The only thing going for it is it is the last new Magoo show to be produced by UPA (""What's New, Mr. Magoo"" was produced by DePatie-Freleng). The biggest problem with it is, although somewhat historical, it is also quite boring. The best moments are at the beginning when Magoo is arriving at the UPA studios. As usual, Jim Backus voices, but it is not enough to perk up the proceedings. Check out ""Magoo's Christmas Carol"" instead."
2,Not the original!!!!!,"After watching a Magoo short tacked onto our Mr. Magoo's A Christmas Carol disk, my kids were in love with Mr. Magoo! I shied away from the box-set because reviews complained of censorship that ruined their nostalgia surrounding the cartoon, so I purchased several of these titles, not realizing they were a re-made series from the 70s. Unfortunately, not funny...not clever...not sharp like the original series. Boo. Disappointing!!!"
2,Expect this belt to last 1 year with regular use.,"After less than 1 year's use, bean bag weights fell out as the fabric gave way at the bottom. Took to local seamstress to fix. After fixed about 1 month went by and a weight is falling out of the weight belt again. Seamstress won't touch it again. Got the MIR belt which is vastly superior in fit, weight holding ability and sturdiness."
1,"Not as pictured, nor as advertised.","This company needs to update it's webpage. The weight belt I ordered (and returned) looked nothing like what was in the picture. It also stated in the description that it came with 20 one pound weights. Instead, it came with 10 two pound weights. Very disappointing."
4,Gundam MG model kit for GP01FB,Bought this MG model kit for the Gundam GP01FB as a gift. Great present with lots of detail and accuracy. The low cost was the best bargain for the buck.
3,Not so good,"I have tried the Uttappam mix from MTR. I loved that product. So, I bought this, expecting same quality and taste. But I did like this at all. The taste is off, does not taste like Dosa. I recommend MTR Uttappam mix instead."
2,Not Worth It,"It's possible these do work - but to see any noticeable result, I think I would have had to feed my 80 lb. dog half a box every day. These stink to high heaven, don't seem to work, and are expensive. I'd try another method before trying these again."
2,Biscuits,Dogs won't eat! Leave and maybe eat later. Would not buy again. Can't tell if it helps or not. Need to add some flavor!
1,Sent a different product,"The product pictured (peanut butter flavored) works just fine. I was sent a box that didn't indicate a flavor but had a burst that says ""with cranberry"" on the front of the box. My dog seems to like it OK, but it's not what I thought I was ordering."
4,simple yet good,"80% parts from the MG RX-78 1.0, simple, good for begnners, but the engineering pales in comparison to new models such as the MG Freedom Gundam."
3,Master Grade GM kit from Gundam mythos.,"Basically the model kit is from the recycled mold of Gundam kit. You don't expect too mucy durability because...it's a model kit, not a toy. One real problem I have with this one is that it has a very loose knee joint. Any attempt to have it loaded with all the weapons will make GM hard to stand up, and The waist part falls appart easily. I really won't recommend it unless you are a real big fan of Gundam universe."
2,A collection man page,"Mostly a collection of man page information, Title is misleading - Should be Linux Commands in a nutshell.I bought this book expecting more description of concepts but was disappointed"
5,Invaluable for sysadmins and users,"This is O'Reilly at it's best, thorough and well research, concise and well produced. This is the lookup reference for everything you need to know about Linux commands. It should be on the bookshelf of any sysadmin or user, and placed so that it's easy to reach."
4,New 6th edition appears to be a worthy update to its predecessors,"This book covers the administration of, usage of, and shell programming on Linux systems. The book is an overview of Linux and serves as an excellent reference, but doesn't come close to a tutorial. This 6th edition continues to be a good extended man page for the operating system's many commands, features, and utilities. Linux has recently been extended, and most of those extensions appear to be covered in this book. You should already have a basic knowledge of Unix/Linux and just need a quick reference for when you forget something. For example, you are not going to learn how to program using gawk with the chapter included in this book. Neither will you figure out the intracies of version control and Git. The preface states that this new sixth edition has been examined and checked against the most common Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and SUSE) so that it reflects the most useful and popular commands."
2,extra reference.,"over half of this book consists of material already available in the ""man"" pages on a linux system.the book boasts how it includes many many examples on how to use each command, this is utterly false. there are infact too few examples included.100% of the material in this book can be found on the internet, on the linux system's info and man pages.this book will not be friendly for the linux newbie. the title is misleading, ""in a nutshell"" usually means ""the basics of a working system"". this book is merely acts as reference for the abundance of reference freely available."
2,reprint of the man pages,"400 pages of the 900 pages are a reprint of the man pages. Other parts of the book can be found online. For example the chapters on shell programming, you can find similar stuff online.I would like to know how to change task priorities. I heard about the nice command. I look it up in the book and it is just a reprint of the man pages. The man documentation isn't very helpful.If you don't like to read online, then this is book for you. If I purchased this book from a local book store, I would return it. Anyone know of a better book for experienced people coming from the MS Windows world?Daniel"
2,"Better than nothing, but tedious to wade through.","After spending a fair bit of time with FreeBSD and needing some information regarding Linux installations I thought this book would be a good way to speed things along. Wrong. It's not that this book is too expensive, or poorly put together, but it's little more than a cursory overview of the Linux operating system and a listing of the commands to get things done with a terminal. But even to find the commands to do simple things such as renaming files, is too time consuming to be bothered with. Simply doing a Google for the stuff you want to know is much quicker and more comprehensive.Whole chapters are committed to such stuff as Emacs and KDE. But, yet again, there are specific websites with HTML help manuals for this, and more.These Open Source books are pretty much a waste of paper, simply because, being Open Source, it's all available online, or in the manuals provided with the distros."
4,Excellent reference book on Linux,"This is a book that you should keep handy while working with Linux. Every time I had a doubt in commands, this book always had an answer.If you are looking for a tutorial on Linux, or detailed installation or other step by step tasks, this is not for you."
3,Critique In a Nutshell,"This book has a LOT of technical info. However, finding info by keyword in the index of the book was for myself kind of frustrating. That's why I gave it 3 instead of 5 stars. Plus, this is not what I would call a beginners book. As I move along in Linux though, I believe this book will become valuable."
3,Adequate Trimmer,"The rotary blades work much better than the reciprocating blade designs. Its light and fits comfortably in your hand. It trims well enough for your ""close up"". Keep the slots clean with a soft brush. They could knock another dollar off the price. It's simple ""made in China technology"" and not the best bargain at $6.99 plus shipping costs."
2,Does Not Cut Close Enough,"Maybe it is a new safety thing, but I purchased this item really does not cut close enough to be effective. It got nothing in my ears and nose. Just to experiment, I tried it on the edge of my eyebrow -- to barely got anything there either. I returned it. I was looking to replace an older Panasonic that was really effective. Looking at both models together, this one seems to have a bigger safety cage around the steel blades. The impact is that this model is probably safer but is not effective unless you have really long hairs (and it won't trim those all the way down)."
3,a noisey little trimmer,"it does OK, nothing to write home about. However its a lot more convienent than using those little scissors. I'm satisfied. Thank You"
2,Remington NE300 Precision Rotary Wet/Dry Nose & Ear Trimmer,"OF THE COMPETING PRODUCTS I HAVE TRIED, THIS NOSE HAIR TRIMMER IS THE MOST INEFFECTIVE. THE BLADES ARE TO SHORT TO REACH ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE SHAVE HEAD. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN DONE PURPOSELY TO PREVENT OVER CUTTING IF NOSE HAIRS. THE DESIGN IS MORE COMPLEX THEN IT'S COMPETITORS AND MAY HAVE A HIGER FAILURE RATE. THIS DESIGN MAKES IT HARDER TO CLEAN. IT IS THE MOST ATTACTIVE LOOKING OF THE ELECTRIC NOSE TRIMMERS I HAVE TRIED. IF IT WERE MORE EFFECTIVE THE PRICE WOULD MAKE IT VERY RESONABLE."
2,"so far, so bad","My item was shipped bruised and damaged, parts were off there trees, and one of the feet was smashed beyond prepare. I cant wait to build the non-broken product, guess I will have to wait a little longer."
5,Great for preteens,My son spends hours putting these models together. I love that it keeps him interested and away from the Television for some time.
4,1/100 Kemper Ms-18e Model ( not for playing ),I purchase this model kit and was my first time building model kit and found it to be easy and fun. The instruction are clear and to the point as long you look at the pictures there is no English instruction it took me 30 minutes to build
3,Disappointed.,"Very crucial mistake, cd was missing which actually shows you how to pronounce the pictures and names! These things should be checked before they are sent out to avoid disappointment/returns."
5,Love this book,I purchased this book several years ago from Amazon when I was trying to learn Samoan to surprise my step-grandfather who speaks mainly Samoan. I still have the book and CD to this day and still use it to learn and refresh the language. It was a great buy.
4,Cute dump truck,"With so many dump trucks out there, it's hard to know which one to buy. My son has so many of them, honestly, I would have never bought this one. But we recieved it as a gift, and he loves it. The handle on top is hard for him to figure out, because you have to push it down then back up for the truck to move. But also, if you push the little person down, the truck will move as well. It makes cute sounds and moves forward with his eyes moving and mouth. It has a lot of room in the back to put rocks or small things in it. The only thing I thought that was wierd was the spiral platform on the side. It looks like you can put him on there and he will spin around to the top, but you just put him on there and it goes up and down manually and makes noises. My son dropped it from high off the table the other day, the back of the truck fell off, but it easily could be put back together. Also, has a on and off switch so you don't always have to run down the battery!!"
3,A battery zapper...,"My son got this toy from Grandpa for X-mas when he was 16 months. He enjoys it, but it does not do well on carpet and we seem to be replacing the batteries every week - whether he plays with it or not. It's an ok toy, but not lots of fun when the thing dies."
5,Great for scoring coroplast for guinea pig cages,This tool makes it so much easier to score coroplast. I'm always rebuilding my guinea pig cage so I've decided to invest in this tool. I should have gotten it sooner.
5,Works as advertised,We were cutting coroplast by hand before running across this item. This is a great time saver when cutting coro lengthwise. It is not made for cutting across the flutes but for cutting long lengths with the flutes it is great. You can even cut just one layer so you can bend it at angles for interesting signage uses.
5,Jon's Adventures in Space,"Breaking new ground for Jon is nothing new. ""Angles Embrace"" is sonic, airy (almost spacey), meditative, soothing and totally relaxing! His occasional vocals only enhance the overall effect. Synthesized music leans heavily on tonal blendings and harmonics and less on rhythm. Nature sounds blend perfectly into the background. Play this CD in repeat mode and it's hard to tell where the last track ends and the first begins. A excellent addition for Anderson fans."
4,Angels Embrace,"The Album is up to Jon's High Standards. Suitable for a lazy Sunday afternoon, or on a rainy day. Don't drive listening to this."
2,And now the leftovers,"Having purchased this primarily for the ""Nightime"" side, ( as with it's predecessor) This follow-up compilation doesn't come close, which is the rule for most ""#2's"". The Deuter piece at the end of disc 2 is the standout, but that's worth the price in my (pocket)book. The ""Daytime"" disc is pleasant wallpaper music not nothing distinctive nor distinguished. Good for dentists waiting rooms I suppose."
4,It's all a dream,"One of my all time favorite television shows.When season 9 is released on DVD in the future & we ""ALL REMEMBER SEASON 8 WAS A DREAM"".I have made this same comment on the last few DVD season released.I am VERY disappointed ONCE AGAIN NO CAST COMMENTARY.I remember Donna Reed passed away about a year after she did the ""fill in"" for Barbara Bel GeddesBut, remember, season 8 is a dream.Was glad we got rid of Jenna Wade (Priscilla) when the dream is over. HATE THAT CHARACTER.No cast commentary is the reason I gave this DVD package it's rating."
1,Wrong Disc Problem Continues,"Some have reported getting wrong discs in this set. I went through two sets of Season 8 with Amazon: one had a Waltons disc in place of disc 5, and another had a duplicate copy of disc 4 in place of disc 5. And both copies could not play Disc 1, Side A, episode 3 all the way through without sticking. Apparently Amazon has a bad shipment from the manufacturer at one of their warehouses. I was told that I could not get a copy from one of their other warehouses, so I got a refund. I plan to purchase this set from somewhere else. It's a shame, since all the other Dallas season sets I received were just fine, except for Season 10, which they replaced immediately (it appeared like it was stepped on and crushed)."
1,dissapointed......,"We sat down to start disc two and realized there were 2 disk three's and didn't get disk two.....So, we have missed everything on disk two and had to move on to disk three.....erg......"
4,dallas,first time i bought from amazon and was pleased with product i hope to complete my dallas series thank you
5,Best Show Ever!!!!,"Dalls is the best show ever!!! JR Ewing is by far the most evil TV character ever. I just can't stop watching Dallas, because I have to find out what he's going to do next."
3,Dallas Season 8,"I haven't watched all of it. I have a few eposides left. I think this season is not one of the best. There is a LOT of focus on sex/love affairs. I know affairs are a huge thing on ""Dallas"" but I felt there were more DUDDY affairs than business. If you want the whole series, this is part of it."
5,Movie Buff,"Haven't watched the Movie as yet but have thouroughly enjoyed all of the others, collect several, actually nemerous box sets. Nothing beats the oldies. Have always had good selection results and shipping from your agents. Especially DVLegacy. Don't know exactly what you are looking for, but hope these few lines help.Thank You for the great serviceIan Wilson"
3,What happened to the Acting????,I recieved season 8 a few days ago and am into episode 4. So far I am mildly disappointed. The acting leaves a lot to be desired. Everyone seems a little bored as if they have lost their spunk. So far Ho-Hum
1,If only there were a Disc 3...,"I admit it - I'm a Dallas addict. So imagine my response when, last night, I opened the inner box to put away Disc 2 and start on Disc 3... only to find I've been supplied TWO Disc 2s and no Disc 3! A call to Amazon was not even remotely helpful, ""I'm sorry, but you're past your 30 day return window."" I'll make future purchases elsewhere."
5,Hidden Passions gr8 read,If you watched the soap opera Passions then this book is a must read gives insight to how it all started. I just love Tabitha and TimTim and the kitty too. :)Too bad the show was cancelled it was a great silly soap.
2,"A nice, trashy, escapist read, but ...","Why did Passions hype this book only to disregard the so-called history Hidden Passions revealed? Really insulting, if you ask me; I bought Hidden Passions the week it came out, and less than a year later *poof* most of the history laid out in the book has been changed.In Hidden Passions, Eve is the only child of well-to-do parents, later on we find out that not only does she have a sister, but that the family was poor. I could go on, but I don't watch Passions anymore for a very good reason.So, if you want to spend eight bucks on glorified fanfiction, go right ahead. If you're looking to read something that sheds some insight on the older characters' histories, forget it, Passions changes the motivations and histories of the characters like a normal person changes underwear."
4,Uncovering Harmony&#65533;s Hidden Passions,"Rather than simply recap storylines currently unfolding on-screen, HIDDEN PASSIONS actually takes fans into the past, shedding light on questions viewers of the NBC soap have been asking since the serial premiered. Want to know what happened to Eve Russel's love child? Or why Ivy married Julian despite her burning love for Sam? Look no further, because Harmony's favorite witchy-woman has opened her diaries and laid bare the secret lives and desires of her friends and neighbors. This is a must-have for fans of the serial, and a great primer for those looking for a new soap to watch. While non-PASSIONS fans no doubt will enjoy the romantic exploits of Harmony's residents, they most likely will find themselves desperately wanting to know what happens next... and tuning in tomorrow to find the answers!"
5,Picked it up and couldn't put it down,"This has got to be my favorite book of all time! First off I have to say that I am a HUGE Passions fan. That's why I decided to read this a couple years ago. I'm soooooo glad I did. It's awesome! If you're a Passions fan, or if you just started to get into Passions, then this is a MUST-READ!!! Trust me, you'll be glad you did."
5,Great Escape!,"I didn't expect to like this book, thought it would be too light and silly. It was, in fact, light and silly but also wicked good fun. How can one resist Tabitha and wouldn't you know she'd dedicate the book to her one and only Tim-Tim? How I love them. When's the sequel coming out? I hope sooner than the next Harry Potter!"
1,Worst book I've ever read.,"This is entirely a formula book, perhaps a ploy to draw in viewers. It was like reading a regurgatated Harlequin romance.A very, very disappointing read.This book is a disgrace to the publishing industry."
1,What A Dissapointment!,"As a long time viewer of Passions, I thought this book would be as much fun as the show, but I found it to be silly and incredibly juvenile. Perhaps the authors were aiming at a younger, less educated market, but the level of the writing is almost insulting to one's intelligence! I suppose it does a good job of telling the stories behind everyone's favorite characters, but that's only if you can get through the sacchrine sweetness and absolutely childish writing level. I think I'll stick to watching the soap on tv from now on...I wish I could get my money back!"
1,Mis-advertised,This is not a Culligan brand filter. Culligan filters are sold in two packs. This is a single and costs more money due to shipping and handling.
5,Beyond Journey,"I bought this CD when it was first released. It remains, to this day, one of my FAVORITE pieces of outstanding guitar work. This is Neal at his BEST!I agree with the others here, Quite possibly the FINEST recording of Smooth Jazz guitar ever. Don't pass this by...BUY IT! This CD is an orgasm for your ears, mind & soul!"
