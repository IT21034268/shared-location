5,"Excellent book, unique point of view!","In search for a book that will explain in simple terms Wicca I came across this one. It is written in a fun way making the reader comfortable with its contents and its arguments are well structured. What is unique about it is that it's not written for those who are on the Wiccan path but for those who want to know what Wicca is without practicing it for themselves. Trying to explain Wicca can be complicated and with all the misconceptions around it gets more difficult. This book is perfect for both Wiccans who want something to help them explain their path and non-Wiccans who are curious, interested or afraid for their beloved ones being involved in Wicca.Am I recomending it? Definately. It gives solid information without being boring and can be a great start point or just a great help to clear away negativity and fear about this path."
3,cash cab comedian,"the thing was pretty low budget, but funny.The Cash Cab guy stars, and he's not bad.Have a laugh on the pharmacist"
2,Performers are better than this...,"As a pharmacist, and as a pharmacist who has worked many a third shift in the retail setting, there are far funnier and goofier experiences (that are not 'in jokes' in the pharmacy trade) than this film presents. The performers do their best with the material, often far outshining this slapdash tale, but ultimately, it's quite a disappointment - and at barely 70 minutes, I still found myself amazed at how it seemed to drag.The fixation on sex and fantasies comes across as pretty juvenile, and if you're wondering where the R rating comes from, it's from frequent drops of the F bomb and not from any gratuitous tittilation.The mini movies included as an afterthought are nice but again, show that the performers can do quite a lot with feeble and overworked material.I would really have liked to see this entire cast in a much better film."
4,Mysteries revealed.,"Paul Leveille is truly a master of Pastel Portraiture. The book reveals many of the mysteries of properly building up a pastel painting to achieve a lifelike, realistic looking portrait. The book takes you through eight detailed portraits, start to finish. One drawback for me was, Paul does not give us a starting photograph of the subject, so during the stages it is difficult to know why the lights and darks, colors and shadows are placed where they are until you see the finished portrait. More a tutorial of techniques than a means of following along and copying his works step-by-step. Still, an excellent source of learning that will leave you able to create realistic portraits in pastel."
5,Perfect instructions for painting portraits in pastels,"What an brilliant book, it really explains how to develope your pastel portraits, from which side of the paper to use, smooth or rough depending on your subject, to how to begin the portrait and how to improve step by step. This artist has an amazing technique and the end results are superb."
4,Pretty good,"LKK is a pretty good brand for most anything they sell. (As are ""Healthy Boy"" and ""Asia Best."") However, you might want to try the LKK oyster sauce that has ""No MSG"" printed on the label. LKK sauces are assertive. And oysters are the third or fourth down the ingredients list--after water, sugar, and so on. You might also try an excellent Thai oyster sauce. It features oysters as the main ingredient, first on the list, and a full 30% of the total contents! Its English brand name is Maekrua and the label features a healthy looking woman against a blue background pouring the sauce into a giant wok. A more subtle sauce than most, but also more meaty (as opposed to sweet or salty). Maekrua's motto is ""Diversity and Refinement"" which, although certainly oxymoronic, is a noble ideal."
5,Beyond the Grave,I have been looking for this book for over a year. It is a collaboration by Muller/Pronzini which uses each author's main character. A very good mystery.
5,Great Expectations,"We just returned from a 3 week trip to Belize. It was our first trip to Belize, or even any where south of the border. We planned the trip with the help of this book and one other. We found the reccommendations, suggestions, and other helpful info to be right on the mark. We're only slightly adventurous but with the help of this book, felt confident enough to use the local buses, make and change plans as needed mid-stream, and immerse ourseves in the local culture. Our trip was great."
4,Very Informative!,"This book intriqued me since it read like an informative guide rather than just a commercial one. I enjoyed the background history and the eco-tourism approach which helped me to appreciate what the government of Belize is trying to do to preserve it's natural beauty. It was very enlightening. I also enjoyed the author's personal take on the different regions and people he had encountered.Now I know that Belize is not just a typical tourist destination, but one full of unusual sights and cultures. I can't wait to go now after reading Adventures in Nature Belize!"
3,okay,"Lots of useful information, but should by no means be the only book you take with you. Entries are sparse and there's really nothing in it that you can't find on a Belize travel website."
3,Probably not his best work,"The book is good, there is no point in denying it. However, after reading Alice in Wonderland, Alice trough the looking glass and What the turtle said to Achilles it leaves you a bitter aftertaste that this is not one of his best works.I imagine that if you read this book before the other you would probably enjoy it much more, though I doubt that anybody would be able to do it since Alice is one of the most famous characters that exists"
4,Well written poem and funny story,"If you like fun poetry this is a good book. The story is funny, the rhymes are clever, and it is a easy read. Good for story time with the children."
3,A Ghost's Rules,I'm not a great reader of poetry but it does interest me and so I read Phantasmagoria. And here a ghost lays down the rules for ghosts residing in and people accomodating ghosts. It sets up what kinds of ghosts have priority in residents. There is no real haunting involved. It is a short read and the poetry is interesting. The story line left me a little in the ozone but if you have a little spare time and like Carroll you might enjoy his poetry in this one and even find the little ghost of interest.
3,Sadly disappointed,"Mailman by J Robert Lennon reminds me of The Corrections in its utter mocking distaste for all characters, as well as the detailed descriptions of physical discomfort and dramatic bowel evacuation. Also, it has the ugliest cover of any book currently on my bookshelves. Fun times!Read Light of Falling Stars instead."
3,Better Than Grading Papers,"My definition of a good movie is one during which I never wonder what time it is.My definition of a good read is pretty similar. This one had me howling late at night when I started it. I kept expecting it to hook me, to addict me, to make me sacrifice the rest of my life to get back to it. But it never did.I didn't enjoy the flashback sequences. I wanted him to get on with the present. I was interested enough to read it halfway through, but in the end, and of course I'm allowed to be selfish here, I didn't like Mr. Lippincott. It wasn't exactly that he was weird. He was unlikeable and uninteresting because of it. I should like or understand the hero, I think. And I didn't. Lennon is a good writer for sure. But I'd be mad if I paid money to read this one.And that's the truth (Edith Ann raspberry)."
3,Entertaining film,"An entertaining film. However, the first part of this film is much better than this one. An interesting film worth spending an evening with the family."
1,trashy movie,"trashy movie a la mama mia, takes place in Greece, you like Blake Lively, it's for you, but not for me"
4,To Be Fair...,"To be fair, I think this movie should be evaluated on its own merit. In itself, it's actually a fairly decent story about a group of young adult girls struggling to maintain ties with each other at a time when everything else in their lives is changing. As close to a female coming of age movie as I've seen, since that genre usually focuses on boys. It's not a great movie, but I wasn't sorry I spent the time/money on it, either. The difficulty comes into it when it's compared to the first Traveling Pants, because the five star experience of the first film causes the second one to pale in comparison."
3,"Nice, Lighthearded Movie",I thought this movie did a great job showing the value of sisterhood and your nearest and dearest friends.
2,Not Nearly as Good As the First One,"I really enjoyed Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. But, the sequal is boring. The script goes nowhere and even the acting isn't as good. It might be an OK choice if you're looking for a very light teen chick flick to watch on a rainy day. I certainly don't recommend it though. Glad I rented it instead of buying the DVD."
4,Great!,"I loved this movie! The story line was great, the scenery was awesome! Great movie to watch with the girls lol."
4,Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2,Very good movie although I liked the first one better it was still very good.
5,Very pleasant body spray,Adidas Ice Dive body spray has pleasant smell. It retains its smell for long hours. I does not smell like spirit. Thats why I am using this for more than 5 years :)
3,"Old school but very, very slept-on","DMG is a true diamond in the rough. He had a chance to be one of the best rap-alot has put out, Scarface overshadows the label a lot, so people think thats all they have to offer. WRONG!!! dMG STYLE IS very tight and this album was well put together..U can hear a sample of him on Scarface ""The World is Yours"" a song called U Don't Hear Me Doe. Also on Geto Boys ""Bring It On"" clique song or on the good, da bad, and the ugly CD. Trust me he will grab You and he may not let go!!!"
5,Amazing G Rap!,It brings me back to an era of Rap where it was on a higher level than what it is today. Amazing production. Glad I bought it!!!
4,"If you're a Savoy Brown fan, then you have to buy this","This is a great 2-albums-for-the-price-of-one collection. You get yerself two classic Savoy Brown albums (especially Street Corner Tallking), both remastered, with some decent liner notes. The sound is more up-to-date than the old Deram versions, so this purchase was a no-brainer for me. The only downside is that the artwork has been shrunk to nearly nothing, but that's a small price to pay for the upgrade in audio quality."
5,maybe his next movie will be in theaters!,"I was really impressed with van-damme's new movie, good fights,good plot and good acting!. He is going the right path in making good movies and the movie is doing very well in the usa being in the top 6 most hired movies in the country!, don't be surprised he bounces back and ends up in theaters real soon!, JEAN-CLAUDE VAN-DAMME IS BACK!!!"
2,Call it a quits Claudia,"Im a big fan of his movies but this shows thats his time is up. he needs to retire. the whole movie, there was no karate moves and it was basically all street fighting.plus this movie made him look like a wimp as well."
3,What is Lawrence Taylor doing in Russia?,"Or the bigger question, wtf is he doing in this movie? Maybe the originaltitle of this flick was (What)In Hell (is LT Doing in Russia?) LOLOK OK, this is not a horrible movie, its not great either and recommendedonly for Van Damme fans, and for Russian Mafia fanatics. I am the later.Our hero is imprisoned in the former Soviet Union after his wife is killed,released by the courts, then done in by Van Damme. The prison scenes are veryrealistic, and shows the brutal reality and the corruption that rules thatlife. Soon after being locked up, Van Damme is drafted into the local gladiatorritual and fights his way to the top of the heap while planning his escapewith the help of LT, his Warrior Poet Guru and Life Partner. hahaThe film has an excellent techno/clasical soundtrack, and the action is notobscured by CGI. Its actually pretty well done but I'm still trying to figureout how they spent $17M on this thing, but its worth a watch."
4,Van Damme in a flick worth watching,"Along with many of the other reviewers I must say this is something of a rarity, a good Van Damme movie. Make sure you watch fairly closely to catch the small details that make it this way."
1,"Every time when I think it can't get any worse, it does.","I used to be a big Van Damme's fan, and still love Blood Sport, Cyborg, and other ""old"" movies. His new movies are getting worse and worse with each new release though. First he dropped down to the level of Jackie Chan's movies, the Chinese-produced ones. Now he went even one lower, to a B-/C+, third-rate production. The plot is completely cliche, the acting is very amature, and on top of that - once again - Van Damme does No martial arts type fighting whatsoever. I never thought Van Damme was a good actor, but I admire his form, speed, and style in martial arts. Now he is trying to be a ""real actor"" I guess, which he is not and will never be. All in all, my recommendation is - don't waste your time. Even being a hardcore Van Damme fan I just can't recommend this to anyone at all. Although it seems like a great number of people disagree with me."
3,I'll have to see the last of it when hubby's gone hunting,"I knew that Jean Claude Van Damn had created some pretty-boy kickboxing movies a decade ago. When my husband was interested in watching ""In Hell"", I wasn't enthusiastic about it. Wow, did our roles reverse. He was soon bored. I, on the other hand, had realized that when you scratched beneath the surface, there was a whole lot more to this film than realistic prison violence. My redneck husband is also the ""Keeper of the Remote"" and it wasn't long before he was surfing other cable channels. <sigh>I must buy it! 3-Star rating because I only watched the first half but I'm hopeful that it ends up with a 4-star or above!Way-to-go Jean Claude!KDi"
1,TO HELL WITH IT,"After Derailed I thought Van Damme would fade into action film bliss but....He returns with In Hell. How many movies have been made about a guy fighting all odds in prision(20,30??) I really cant say much more than the other reviews, He goes to prision, gets born again hard, and starts kickin booty. I have been wondering why all his new flicks go straight to viedo now I know. This film was bad. We fell asleep during his escape scene. One more thing Van Damme looks bad in this film like life has beat him down once to often...beat him bad."
4,Finally a decent Van Damme Flick,"I had about given up renting the Van Damme flicks, especially after the horrible Derailed. I watched this last evening and was very surprised. Van Damme finally gives a real acting performance and has a supporting cast that does the same. There is no fancy spinning kicks, just down and dirty real street fighting and realistic depiction of prison life. It is a story of redemption. Losing his wife and all that is dear, Van Damme descends into the hell of a russian prison and learns about being true to oneself. Highly recommended."
4,Inspiring,This is a beautiful book. I find the articles meaningful and applicable to life in general.
5,Suprisingly gripping,"I thought I would find this book obtuse, difficult and boring but I was completely wrong. The reason I bought the book is that I am working on a history project and wanted to get a sense of what people were reading in the early 1900's. I read the book in a few days because I could not put it down. While it is wordy-as was the style at the time-it is well written and gripping."
2,A trainwreck of a marriage,"William Ashe is an up-and-coming English politician. He meets Lady Kitty, a 19-year-old girl who... well, acts like a 19-year-old girl. (If you know a 19-year-old girl then you understand what I mean.) After barely knowing her, Ashe decides to up and marry her. So when the expected calamities begin to happen, I have no sympathy for Ashe. He was the adult in this situation, he should have known what to expect. It's Kitty who has my sympathy. She goes on and goes on making bad choices because she's never made to deal with the results of her actions. She didn't have much of a mother and Ashe is not much of a husband, so she doesn't have a guiding hand into adulthood. (I appreciate that later in the book a character speaks up and basically says the same thing.) In the end, Ward takes the typical out for the story (death) and nothing is accomplished."
4,Darius must have been soooo overconfident,"The computer animation plus narration gave me a sense of tension as to how the battle would be fought. I had never before heard of such unequal odds: 250,000 Persian soldiers and cavalry outnumbered the (well-trained) Greeks 5:1. Alexander even possessed brillance in persuading his army to stand and fight. -- Comparisons might be made with the ""You Are There"" history series, one which emphasised interviews with critical figures in the event. The combination of the two would likely have elicited a 5-star rating. As is, I still found it compelling."
4,Excellent***,"For a young actor, this book provides clever comic monologues from contemporary plays. Included is a monologue from JOHN LEGUIZAMO'S ""The Freak"", in the style of his off the wall, zany, fast-paced humour. There are monologues for all age groups, from the 20s to the 70s. I would not reccomend this for the teenage actor, but for the mature beginner. It provides room to grow and monolgues that are flip, cynical, and very sad.Tony DeMil FL, USA"
3,"Great Fight, Not So Great Book","The fight between Nigel Benn and Gerald McClellan was one of boxing's greatest, so any book about it is going to be fascinating just because of the subject matter.I found this particlular book to be unfocused in its approach. The author couldn't seem to decide if he wanted to write about this one fight, the whole sport of boxing, or his experiences in the sport, and it gives the book a confused feeling at times.On top of that, several of the things he asserts are just plain not true, and he allows his personal opinion to color his telling of the story to a ridiculous degree at times.I would reccomend Nigel Benn's book ""Dark Destroyer"" instead, or if you're really interested in this one fight, go ahead and read this one, but take it with a grain of salt"
4,"A high-quality, delightful poetry book","My daughter fell in love with this book starting at the age of two. (She is now 3-1/2.) The poems have been selected from a wide variety of authors, and the quality is high. The subjects are ones that children can easily relate to, and the vocabulary and rhythm are engaging. My only criticism is that I would like to see more children of color in the illustrations."
3,Floaty Boat,"Although my 2 year old adores the Little People toys, this is her least favorite. It is durable and cute enough, but it easily sinks almost as soon as it is placed in the water. Fisher Price needs to improve on the model. It is their only water toy, so they really should come up with a better product. If you are considering Little People toys in general, all the rest are wonderful and all encourage children's use of imagination. I recommend them highly...so would 2 year old Zoe I am sure."
5,Cute Toy!,"I like this toy, but like everyone else that has entered a review, I think they should have made the boat float a little bit better. My daughter loves this toy, though!"
2,Somewhat of a disappointment,"While the toy gets put into the bath on a regular basis, there is usually little actual playtime with it. The hook on the end is a bit frustrating to use for little 2-year-old hands, and the rotating sleeper cabin piece is never used."
5,Great bath time Entertainment,Good bath tub toys are far and few between. I was excited to find one in the popluar and durable Little People toy products.
2,Disappointed,"I was excited about purchasing this for my son, then we brought it home and found it sinks like a rock. It takes on water easily, the person isn't the quality we expected from Fisher-Price, it seems cheaper than older Little People. The dial to turn his bed to the sailors quarters is hard to turn-they could have made a better knob. I think older kids would like it more than the age they recommended it for. Why is it so hard to find good tub toys?"
3,Better as a land toy,"The only complaint I have about this toy is that it does not float in the bath tub. It sinks if it gets the least bit of water in it. The little people can get water in them if left in the tub too long and there is no way to get the water out other than let them air dry. This is fine for kids to play with on the floor or in the sand box, My son likes it and he plays with it when he plays with his other little people toys."
3,FP Floaty Boat troubles,"My daughter loves this toy, BUT the Little Person and the fish fill up with water, are difficult to empty and thus cause mold to grow inside of them. I've had to take them after each bath and rinse them with hot water and hydrogen peroxide to clean them. The hot water is needed because that is the only way the person gets soft enough to squeeze the water out of her. It ends up being pretty gross, but I continue because as I said, my daughter loves this toy. Poor planning on Fisher Price's part!"
3,Titanic of Fisher Price toys,"My daughter enjoys it in or out of the tub, but it really bothers ME that the toy is marketed as a bath toy and does NOT float."
3,mom of 2 boys,"Although this boat is durable and has withstand much abuse from my sons, ages 1 and 3, the paint on the boat has chipped and has left MANY marks on the bathtub. Even though they can come out with some scrubbing, after 2+ years of playing with it, it STILL leaves many colorful marks on the tub!"
2,MOM OF 2 ENERGETIC KIDS,"My kids have a lot of basic bath toys such as plastic bowls and cups so I figured I would get them some real bath toys to play with...well I might as well left this one on the shelves. It NEVER stays afloat, it just sinks to the bottom of the bathtub underneath all the bubbles and it gets forgotten about until I let the water out and pull it to shore. I agree with the other parents, the flip cabin is just useless. The only thing that gets played with is the little toys that came with it but the actual boat just stays outside the bathtub. I guess some kids just like it simple because they love the plastic cups and bowls from my kitchen rather than bath toys from the store."
3,Not sure why it wasn't a hit,"I personally think this is an interesting and durable toy, but my 2 year old daughter seems to disagree.....she has had it for about 6 months now and never plays with it more than a couple minutes in the bath tub or in the swimming pool before finding another toy she enjoys more. She loves all of her other Little People toys (particularly Discover City -- plays for hours if I let her) so I'm not sure why this one was not a hit."
2,"Well, THIS was a waste of money!","Horrid, horrid toy! It tips at the slightest movement of water, then fills with water, then sinks. It has been nothing but a source of frustration for our son! I love Fisher-Price, but this toy is NOT up to their usual standards. Oh, yes, it is well-made, in that my son has thrown it at the tub wall a kablillion times and it hasn't shown the slightest sign of falling to pieces, but it honestly needs to be sent back to the drawing board for a little redesign. The only redeeming aspects are:1) Sturdy2) Little People can be used in other scenarios (Little People or otherwise)3) Nifty purple Hippo float DOES workUnfortunately, these just don't make it worth the price, in my opinion."
2,Floaty boat sinks,"I think everyone deserves their money back on this one. How ironic they call it a floaty boat, when the darn thing sinks. I think fisher price should do the right thing here and give people their money back. Our 12 month old daughter doesn't even have to be playing with the boat and it ends up at the bottom of the tub. Maybe fisher price should have called this one ""sinky boat."" Sorry, Fisher Price, we like a lot of your products, but you really hit the bottom of the tub with this one."
2,Not as great as it looks,"We love Little People and buy every playset we can get our hands on. I must say this toy was very disappointing. Not only does it not float, but it is a little hard for a child to play with. It comes with a fish and a hook for it to go on... my 2 1/2 yr old gets so frustrated trying to get the fish to stay on the hook. He also seems to ge mad when it sinks in the tub and the people float away. We have kept this out of the tub and it mainly sits in the bottom of his toy box. Not one of our favorite Little People toys... I would recommend that you not waste your money on this item."
1,Not worth buying,"I bought this for my grandson for bath time and he doesn't play with it. It's really qite boring, it doesn't do too much or have any options."
1,"not good for water, poor design","This toy is marketed as a bath toy. However, the little guy that comes with it is not water friendly. He fills up with water and it is hard to get it out. Also the boat does not float very well. Very disappointing!"
3,It's a sinker...,"We have tried to play in the pool with the Floaty Boat, but it tips over and takes on water and sinks every time. The people and accessories are really adorable though. This toy is best used on dry land."
4,Love Fisher Price but...,"Bought the boat as a pool toy and now has moved to the tub.The boat has a hard time floating. Add one Little person and a bit of water, the boat will sink. My son still loves it and has played with it for a year. Longer than most other toys. I think the sinking thing bothers the parents more than the kids."
4,Lots of fun in the bath tub!,"Little People are lots of fun, and the Floaty Boat is no exception! The Floaty Boat doesn't get 5 stars due to one major design flaw--it sinks easily and often, especially if you use the shower feature (you pour water into special holes on the top of the boat to give your Little People a shower). But even though it probably should be called the UNfloaty Boat, it's still lots of fun and we play with it every night in the bath."
2,Very disappointed,"My 18 month old daughter was very excited when we brought this home, but it quickly became a least favorite toy. It is cute, but only floats if you don't touch it (silly me to think a water toy should be able to float). The flip cabin is a useless feature. The hook on the end is frustrating for little hands and most often used to tip over the boat. A poorly designed toy that gets little playtime in or out of the bath."
5,"Great photos, good information, unusual plants","I have to confess, when I saw ""Better Homes and Gardens"" on the cover I wasn't expecting much--at most, a rehashing of all the typical, common garden perennials. I was very pleasantly surprised to find a book full of excellent photos and descriptions of many new, uncommon, and unusual garden plants. This book is a great complement to all the other gardening books already out there, and I highly recommend it. Let's hope BH&G continues to put out such high-quality gardening books."
2,returned the book,"I ordered this book to learn more about the flowers I have planted or would like to have in my flower garden. Well, it wasn't what I was looking for. Most of the flowers are ones I have never even heard of or are the kind that would be expensive. It does have beautiful pictures tho. I returned the book."
5,Skunk Off,Eliminated residual skunk odor from pet (after bathing) and from furniture that other products failed to do. Highly recommend this product to others dealing with skunk spray after effects.
3,Better than tomato juice,"It does get rid of the smell, but it has its own odor..perfumieI think hydrogen peroxide, baking soda and a squirt of dish liquid does better. The hydrogen peroxide must be fresh ( must foam up when put with baking soda)"
5,Gets rid of urine smell!,"We have an incontinent cat, so she needs to be cleaned up all the time. This product cleans her easily with just a paper towel, so I don't have to bathe her every hour. It doesn't sting her and she ends up smelling fresh and clean--until she pees again! Then we start over!"
2,My dog still smells like skunk,This product did not get rid of the skunk smell. I bought many bottles of this and my dog still has the smell of skunk on him. I even tried the shampoo. I would not buy this again.
5,Skunk Off,"Hit a skunk with my car, bought this product just in case I needed it again. Haven't used it yet."
2,Skunk Off,"It is little more than a cover for dog odors. It may work on skunk odor. My dog rolls in dead fish and the Skunk off covered the fish oder. However, the odor of the skunk off was very strong and I had to use soap to remove both the fish odor and the odor of the skunk off. I will just use soap and wash the dog and forget using the skunk off. (there use to be a product that I thought was called skunk off. It was an enzyme and really worked on all dog oders)"
2,hate the scent!,"This stuff may get some of the skunk odor off my dog but not as much as I hoped it would. What really bothers me though is the awful scent of the spray itself! It smells just like the same deodorizer chemicals used in a porta-potty. Or when you first step into a camper, you can smell that awful chemical odor which is permeated throughout the camper no matter how clean it is. So I threw the stuff out and am going back to the X-O spray which has a much nicer scent."
1,keep skunks off?,"Unfortunately the product does not keep skunks at bay as promised. I sprayed this on my body, then went hiking in the forest but skunks still squirted me with their noxious fumes. I was stinking so bad I had to jump into a river to get my sinuses to work again.I don't know if I got a bad can of the stuff or if it just doesn't keep skunks away.Either way, 'Skunk Off' really stinks."
5,A seminal classic which belongs in every record collection,"Ever since the DJ at our wedding reception played ""Gangsta of Love"" in lieu of our guest's request to hear The Steve Miller Band's ""Gangster of Love"" my wife and I have been in love with the Geto Boys. I still have vivid memories of her octagenarian Irish grandmother break dancing in the middle of the dance floor and my Italian grandfather proudly (and loudly)singing the choruses in unison with the Maid of Honor. The articulate sincerity of the group's lyrics is at once both metaphorically hauting and inspiring. Although Bushwick does his best to supress any mention of his 4 years of vocal training at Juliard, the operatic overtones are unmistakable. I would recomend this album to anyone with an appreciation of fine vocal art. If you like Puccini, Hayden, Wagner and Mahler, I guarantee that you will love the Geto Boys."
1,Ever Wonder Where Eminem Got His Stuff?,"These guys are so overdone and ridiculous that they make Emenem seem legitimate by comparison. If not for overly sensitive churchwomen, bands like this would never be noticed at all. ""Inside The Mind Of A Lunatic' indeed!"
4,It works,"This pen works well for tagging personal items with ""invisible"" ink that fluoresces brightly under a UV light. The ink is slightly visible when the surface is reflecting light. The pen nib is a bit thick so it is hard to write small. This would be better if it were a fine nib to be able to tag small items. If getting these, get more than a couple to make it worth the shipping cost which is exorbitant for such small items."
2,ATX 78753,The flashlight is a cheap brand it fell apart easily and I don't recommend this item too quickly would love to have a refund or a better product
4,Works good,The shipping was fast. The pen came with a little pen and light. The thing i did not like was that the pens are purple. Not my favorite color but at least it works. The ink was perfect it went invisible fairly quickly. So i subtracted a star because of its color but not because of its quality.
2,You are buying corn flakes!,"Ok, I'll give 2 stars because they taste ok and are convenient.But don't let the different bowls and labels fool you!Over half of the 60 cups are corn flakes.Corn flakes are boring and leave me starving!Smart Start and Healthy Heart are really good cereals, full of protein and fiber.They only have a few of those in the box.Rasin Bran is ok, flakes but with raisins.Special K, Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes, and Rice Crispies HAVE NOTHING.You might as well drink the milk and throw out the cereal.I'm hungry in minuites if not seconds after eating those darn flakes.Stay away from this assortment and try the others.I prefer the ""Wellness Assortment.""They are a lot more filling and provide more energy.The ""Wellness Assortment"" keeps me happy until lunch time.The ""Family Assortment"" just keeps me hungry."
1,Varieties DO NOT match website description!,"The variety of cups in this selection DOES NOT agree with the list of contents on the amazon website. There are 10 cups of Frosted Mini Wheats, which are not listed and the Kashi Heart to Heart has been omitted. My case of 60 arrived damaged. There was a note inside the box from Kelloggs stating that the mixture of varieties will be changed in nov 2006 (it is now aug 2007). I have ordered this variety regularly and this is the first time I have received this selection."
5,Something For Everyone!,"I ordered these cups to send to school with my son. The school gives all children free breakfast here in Georgia, but it is alot of sugar cereals. Instead of him not eating with the rest of the kids, I am sending these cups with him. He can add his milk and eat right from the cup. My husband eats one type of cereal and I like another. So it is a great mix and everyone is happy on the go."
1,"Do Not Buy This Blu-Ray, It is not HD.","This Blu-Ray only has HD menus, all four of the fireplace videos are the original LOW Definition. The biggest challenge is that the original DVD video was reformatted to 1080i (without being upconverted). This means that upconversion DVD and Blu-Ray players ignore the upconversion process because they think the video is already 1080i. That means you'll be looking at a 480 picture the entire time and it is pretty ugly. I contacted First Look Studios, Inc. (The manufacturer and distributor of the disc) and they said that they did not author the disc, but they are aware of the challenge and are receiving quite a few complaints by telephone. They offerred me no solution over the phone, except a ""We're Sorry"". DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. Never has there been more fals advertising on a Blu-Ray disc that I have seen."
1,Blu-ray copy of a VHS tape,"This ""movie"" is so misleading. It says on the box that it was filmed in high definition but hey must of pointed the camera at a TV playing the movie on VHS. You can see the lines on the video and the loop around isn't that long. It plays for a few minutes and then stops and starts over. While I understand there was going to be a loop in there somewhere I know they could have made it a lot less obvious. Terrible, terrible, terrible.By the way, they have this at Best Buy for half the price."
1,Do not buy!,"The quality in this disc was meant for a 13"" standard definition television, at best... I was sideways when I actually played it and saw that it was not in HD. That's right... THIS DISC IS NOT IN HIGH DEFINITION. It looks awful and the pixels are giant. The fact that it is advertised in HD and that it was even put on a blu-ray disc, is a joke. Anyone who bought this, including myself, was definitely ripped off by the company who produced and marketed it. At least I have a nice coaster for my cold drinks now. If you are looking for a high definition fire place blu-ray disc, I would suggest the ""HD Moods"" seriesHD Moods: FIRE [Blu-rayandHD Moods Fire 2.0 (Blu-ray & DVD Combo Set). Although I have not seen the HD Moods series yet, you will notice all of the reviews are much better then they are for this disc."
1,Complete rip-off :-(,"I should have heeded others warnings with regards to this product. While it may reside on a blu-ray disc, it looks to be produced at a standard VGA resolution. Major disappointment come Christmas morning. :("
5,fun book to inspire travel,"I purchased this book solely on the fantastic illistrations but great content as well. my girls and i loved going thru the book several times and had great dicussions about traveling to san fran (which we are planning to do in the near future). i would highly recommend as a travel book for kids in fact, as it does a great job touching on all the fun things in san fran."
4,This is San Francisco,"As a preschool teacher in San Francisco, This is San Francisco had my students so excited that they couldn't stop relating to the story. It took me three days to finish the book since the children wanted to relay their experiences visiting the various sights. A few places no longer exist, but it is still a great book to use as a historical reference. And if you are planning to visit San Francisco, I would take a minute to skim through this book as it has all the places you would want to explore within its pages. By the way, the illustrations are absolutely charming."
5,Great souvenir,A great souvenir of San Francisco for children and adults alike. Great illustrations of facts on all the great tourist spots and neighborhoods. Makes a great gift.
5,Delightful introduction to San Francisco for young travelers,"We will be taking our children, aged three and one, to San Francisco for vacation this summer, and we bought this book to introduce them to the city. They love this book, and it is easy to see why. The illustrations, while fifty years old, have a freshness and vibrancy that has not dimmed with time. The text is a refreshing change from so many of the books we see for kids these days: it is informative and intelligent, while remaining fun and engrossing for the young reader/listener. Our three-year-old pleads with us to read the book to him over and over again.Highly recommended."

2,This was not a good biography.,"This was not a good biography of the late monarch, the author could have done a better job in potraying his subject in the written word. If you're looking for a good biography of King George VI, I would recommend: The Reluctant King: The Life and Reign of George VI, 1895-1952 by Sarah Bradford."
3,a big book that say very little,"This book tries to be comrehensive but fails to adequately cover common letter writing needs. It only includes one, specific, very short example of each type of letter and I did not find it helpful. While some of the sentences were well written some many were not and some seemed rude. For example, the example letter on congratulating a person for completing a job begins by describing why the writer thought the person was unfit for the position. Also this is the exact same book as ""All the Words You'll Ever Need"", word for word the same book."
2,"OK, nothing special","I love Blue, and when I heard that Lee was making a solo CD I decided to check it out. This CD is just a collection of bland pop songs. I love his voice, and I was anticipating some powerful ballads, but instead this CD consisted of soft rock songs mixed with some weak ballads. I liked the song ""When I Think of You"", giving a soulful performance, and ""In the Morning"", a nice soft sound. However, everything else dissapointed me. However, good news is this CD is better than Simon Webbe's CD, which is pure[...]."
2,Not what I expected.,"The positive is that I received the book very quickly. The only negative is that the book is a small, thin copy as if it is designed more for a teenager then for an adult. I thought this book would be a great addition on my bookshelf at home. Since I prefer a more extensive account about Sojourner truth's life I will continue to look for a book that suits my preferences."
3,Historical reminder,"Provided a valuable insight into some of the thinking of slaves even while experiencing inhumane treatment and searching for their own identity. A woman of courage, foresight and well ahead of her time."
4,LAS222 Review,"This is a great book to read because you will learn much about the history of slaving period. The story of Isabella will lead you think deeply about the basis of race, gender and the society. You will be enlightened by her experience and her view of life. Also, you will learn the leadership that was applied by Isabella in her life, after analysis of it, you will learn about how to utilize your own potential power in your life."
4,pretty good stuff,"Idol Tryouts a pretty good record for the up and comingAnn Arbor MI label Ghostly International. The only complaint is some of the music sounds a little generic. But that should soon change with new groups added to the label like Twine, James Cotton and Kosik."
2,"Boring, limited electronica","I bought this CD based on one good track that I heard on Pandora -- ""Laundry"" by Midwest Product. It's a great track, but nothing else on this record measures up. Slow, disjointed rhythms, repetitive unimaginative synth work, no melodic centers to most of the songs, and a distinct lack of theme or direction for the collection. A waste of $. I should have listened to more samples before I bought. Other than Midwest Product, the only good thing about this CD is the very cool graphic art."
1,Ingredients?,"No list of ingredients, ie: whether the calcium is citrate or the magnesium is citrate; no list of how many milligrams of calcium or magnesium is available! What are the other (active or inactive) ingredients?? Perhaps a photo of the label?"
2,plantronics voyager 510slplus headset,"I wish there was something other than star rating system for this one because the product might be perfect, I just don't know. I was upset with this order because I thought the purchase was for teh ear piece, the tower unit, and basically everything else in the picture. Turns out the purchase was ONLY for the headpiece. I might have been at fault here but I can't really give it positive feedback either."
4,Good quality,"I bought a couple of these for closet door pulls. They are well made and elegant. I would have liked them a little larger, but I am pleased with my purchase."
1,"Poor copy, worse than VHS","This review is for the two-movie set, ""Virgin Terror/Spider's Venom"".Video quality very poor, looks like a copy of a copy of a cheap VHS tape. Not worth watching.Audio quality is also very poor, muddy, midrange only, no bass or treble. Very difficult to understand.Standard aspect ratio, not widescreen.Not even worth renting."
5,Great Read!,"""My Year"" is an excellent read for aspiring pilots or anyone who dreams of getting out of the office and doing what you have always dreamed of. The book is fast-paced, exciting and full of things you didn't know about aviation and Alaska. This book is a must buy for anyone seeking ""change"" in their life and has the guts to do it."
5,Great protection for the hood.,"The Lund interceptor Bug Shield is a high quality, decent looking product that fits well and is easy to install.Mounted in the holes under the hood for a factory shield with the included hardware. Does a great job protecting the leading edge of the vehicle's hood from stone chips. Helps with bug splatters on the windshield-just not very much. Save your paint- get a bugshield."
5,A nice book of of BW,"I've read 2 books on BW, compared with another book I¡ve read, this book is on BW 3.0B which is a more mature DW product of SAP, it not only focuses on the BW transactional stuff but also tries to explain the detailed theories and business cases which are the more valuable points for me. If you¡re a BW beginner, this book may not be suitable since it¡s not going to teach you how to extract data, setup info source , create data target or create queries in a detail instruction way, but instead bring you a very completely high-level picture of BW architecture and solutions.The best chapters I would prefer are: Chapter 4 C Information Modeling; Chapter 6 C ETL Services and Chapter 8 C Analytic Application."
4,Great Source of Information for SAP BW,"Great work by the Authors in providing a book which has turned out to be good source of Information of SAP BW , with its excellent content .It provides a Step-by-Step guide of ""Understanding "" the Enterprise Business Warehouse and its relation with the Corporate Information factory , a vision by Bill Inmon (father of Data Warehousing) .Covers all the layers of a Warehouse . A must book for every BW person."
3,generally good content but very badly edited,"A potentially excellent book on the subject marred by: too much redundant and repetitive material, poor organization of content, and absolutely atrocious editing (very annoying!)."
5,Movie,"My kids love this, the story is great and so is the music. We watch it almost every week, yes I'd buy it again"
2,OK - but look out for mistakes,"Actually, I would rate the book about 2.5 stars. An average book that looks like it was written for Premiere 6.0 and then the single chapter on Titles was appended. However the book contains a lot of detail with mistakes as you progress through the lessons. Examples - Page 98 item 8, the ""finish keyframe is D, not A. Another one that plagued Ch 4 and 5 was that Page 87 had the student set ""Blast 14 to 37:15 with a duration of 2:15, which makes a total of 40 seconds. However, the rest of the lessons have this timing off, which affects the applied audio as well (Ch 5). While some techniques were nice to know, they were then repeated rather than adding new techniques to those already learned. My opinion is that Mr Peck was in a hurry to get something in print. This training book and CD could have been much better. I would have liked something a little better."
3,Too many mistakes,There are too many mistakes in this book. There are too many instances where the details in the tutorials in the book don't match the files on the companion CD-ROM. This causes too much confusion when trying to complete the tutorials accurately. This also wastes a lot of time.
3,great mop,"The mop was ok, but it came unglued after the first use and had to fix it prior to using it again. The price was great but the construction did lack attention."
1,Opps,I say 'opps' because after putting it into water where one would assume it would be use it feel apart.
1,Poorly Constructed and Came Apart After One Use!,"What a waste! While this mop seemed like a good value, I quickly found this bar-b-que mop to be an inferior product. After one use, the mop head came out of the handle during cleanup! Even with several attempts the head kept falling out of the handle rendering it useless for any subsequent uses. This mop is not a good value at any price. This is clearly a defective product. I expected something sturdier and I am very disappointed with this purchase."
1,Should Be Called 'Take Two Aspirin',Talk about a bad movie. This film stinks. This one will surely be on 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' someday - NO! WAIT! They'd probably even be embarassed this. The lighting is awful. Dialogue juvenile. Scenes are choppy. Frank Stallone can't act (or sing for that matter). Grant Goodeve is fine but he is very much out of place.
4,Easy and Quick!,My wife installed this herself in 10 minutes. (though I had to get a .pdf from online for how to disassemble her dash) Nuff said.
4,"Good, but not the best","This is a very, very good book. It covers the basics of space flight, and covers specifics such as different types of propulsion methods and possible interstellar missions.However, this book is not mathematically rigorous. Although I suggest everyone buy THIS book, anyone who wants a better mathematical treatment of the topic should try to find a copy of the out-of-print _Prospects for Interstellar Travel_, by Mauldin."
5,Techies buy me!,"This book is intended for the more technically-oriented reader. it covers the more technical aspects of interstealler spaceflight, even going so far as to provide formulae for alot of the problems generated by such flights. However, the writers are obvious devotees of Einsteinian physics because they immediately discount any type of faster-than-light travel as impossible and tend to pshaw the subject and hope it will just go away."
1,never got,"wouldnt recommend this company, sorry but this is what happened too bad i couldnot get the book as i was looking forward to it"
4,replacement book,"I have had a hard cover copy of this book for years, I take camping with me. This is a replacement for it, the edges are starting to show use. (I don't know its age it was a gift)It nice to sit and read before its dark. Grate Replacement!Scott"
5,A fascinating look at the founding of the Wild West!,"Irving Stone has an incredible ability to relate factual information in a highly entertaining fashion. This book is a must read for anyone who appreciates the ""Old West"". It will amaze and delight you with tidbits of information about what really happened with the railroads, the immigrants, gold, water, and the people who were in the thick of it all! Stone's descriptions give the story a very personal feel. From Mexico to the Canadian border, you'll be treated to fascinating description of places, people and events."
2,Obvious Errors,"I agree that Irving Stone's Men to Match My Mountains is an entertaining series of intertwined stories about the settling of the west, but it is tainted by a couple of obvious and major factual errors in the early going. Before page 60, he's got 1840s explorers walking the banks of Shasta Lake, which didn't exist until Shasta Dam was completed in 1944. He's also got guys climbing UP the Eastern Sierra to Owens Lake, which is impossible since Owens Lake is at the base of the Eastern Sierra (or was, until the City of L.A. diverted its water). It makes me wonder what else he got wrong. An entertaining book about history loses a lot of its appeal if it's inaccurate."
1,Misspelled Title!,"I haven't seen this DVD but I would not buy it as it does not even spell the name of the painter correctly, in the cover! it's Velazquez, not Velasquez"
3,Very good book for ESL teachers,"Very good for for those, who like me, are working on being teachers of this language for present and future learners."
5,A must for anyone who embraces adventure,"The desert may be a harsh unforgiving place, but there is much history to be seen there. ""The Western of Desert Egypt: An Explorer's Handbook"" is a guide for those who would dare travel the deserts of Egypt and see experience one of the most iconic places of the world first hand. A complete and comprehensive travel guide, Cassandra Vivian gives a very thorough set of resources sure to give potential and arm chair travelers who wish to explore the aeons old desert themselves a treat. ""The Western of Desert Egypt"" is a must for anyone who embraces adventure."
3,I did not care for it.,The music is pretty but I like a CD to set a mood and this one was just too esoteric for my tastes
1,Gimme a break,"Sounds absolutely childish,singing fairy tales. Appropriate for a kindergarten party. Waste of good air space."
2,"Interesting, but not great","The DVD is well organized and contains some very basic, but very good information. However, I was VERY disappointed in the amount of information about different kinds of locks, pins, and types of picks. My opinion, you can get better information for free off YouTube."
4,A New World,"I've always had an intrest. Since ""James West"" pulled out his lock pick or ""Mission Impossible"" did the same; I've always been mesmerized by the act. The ""Visual Guide to Lockpicking"" opened this world up to me in laymens terms and graphic pictures that I couldn't help but understand.Cool !!! Thanx a million...Write another one, I'll buy it."
4,Good Book,A must read if you are going to travel to Ireland. I went to Ireland in September and it was nice to have the back ground history of Ireland.
5,Excellent historical fiction!,Rutherfurd is outstanding in the genre of historical fiction- reminiscent of Michener- and this is a terrific follow-up to Princes of Ireland. Highly recommended for anyone interested in Irish history; this book is both interesting and informative.
3,Buyer Beware,"While the book was a decent read and kept my interest, the title of it was a little misleading. If you are looking for detailed information on some of Ireland's most popular heroes and Risings (Tone, Connolly, Pearse,1798,1916 etc.....) you will not find it here. In fact, many of the most crucial and/or dramatic events to do with each of Ireland's ""rebels"" are hardly mentioned at all.The book's main focus is on the interaction between various families of different classes through the generations. Again, Rebels Of Ireland hardly lives up to its name but is generally informative and a good read."
2,Rebels of Ireland,The client has never received the book. We have checked with USPS and they do not have a record of the book being delivered. Who do I need to talk to? Thanks.
1,Horrible horrible horrible,"I received this book and it was supposedly very good condition ""like brand new"" and it was ripped, torn, bent in half and had coffee stains on it! It went in the garbage! I tried to find out what happened but for some odd reason the seller never contacted me. It makes me not want to purchase from amazon again. Very disappointed and can't believe someone would have the nerve to actually send something in that bad of shape!"
4,"'For there are two Irelands, not one'","A magnificent saga. This novel starts in 1597 and ends early in the 20th century. Rutherfurd breathes life into the history underlying the tension between those who rule, and those who are ruled. The political history and the sectarian issues are outlined, as background to the families whose lives they shape. Some cameos here: of Dean Jonathan Swift, of Benjamin Franklin and of others we know from their places in history.The real strength of this novel, though, is its capacity to bring to life ordinary people whose worlds are shaped by external events but whose decisions themselves influence the future.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith[Note : the book is published as 'Ireland Awakening' in Australia]"
2,Where's the groove? And the tunes?,"Boy, was this a big disappointment! I loved the One Dove stuff, and I liked Dot's last record, AFTERGLOW, just as much. What the heck happened here? I agree 100% with Derek Mok's review below. There really is nothing like a melody or interesting chord progression here. I realize that sometimes you can get by without those elements to a certain extent if there is a good groove going on. Witness such great albums as SUZUKI by Tosca and Way Out West's brilliant INTENSIFY. But on this record, there simply is no groove. Everything is just plain dull. It reminded me of some of the less successful 80's techno-pop, or like bad Human League and Thompson Twins outtakes. Skip it. And hope that Dot gets back on track with the next one."
5,Saturday Night High!,Saturday Night is a great accomplishment by Stephen Sondheim. You have to buy this life changing cd. I love it. You must take a chance and buy it you will not be disapointed.
2,A little bit of...,"After reading the reviews posted by others I was enthusiastic to purchase and listen to this cd. I was,however, surprised to discover that it wasn't what I expected. As one of the other reviews, which was printed AFTER I bought this, said if you aren't a Soundheim fan, this may not be for you (although I do enjoy most of his shows). I found the lyrics to be somewhat clever, but after listening to the entire cd I did not really feel moved, or even invested in the characters. I love musicals, but this is not one to sink your teeth into or be moved by, it is quaint and somewhat cute, but not one you're likely to see a national tour. Sorry."
3,Primitive Sondheim But Sweet!,"This was Sondheims first musical that he composed, though not his first produced. It was planned for Broadway but producer Lemual Ayres passed away and the production simply died off before ever reaching fruition. It probably would have been a mild success. The score is pleasant, with sweet and clever lyrics, but not quite what Steve would compose in later years. However, it does contain what I think is one os his most beautiful ballads, So Many People. It's absolutely gorgeous, so much so that Barbara Cook has been performing it in concert for years.This off-Broadway production was the NY premier and is competent, though I find some of the Brooklyn accents a bit over the top and grating. Still the music is lovely and showcases the early Sondheim, a must have for Steve fans or musical theater collectors."
3,"Young Sondheim, but Fun","While Sondheim has had his hits and flops, Saturday Night stands out as a middle ground. The score was started as one of his first only to be completed much later, but you can hear a battle between simplicity and complexity that seems to be the maturing Sondheim. The lyrics are of lesser quality than future Sondheim endeavors, but they are not bad. The singers on this album are fun to listen too and the whole CD is just fun. I strongly suggest this for new and old, Sondheim fan or not. Its probably not one I will listen to often but it is certainly a nice one to have around. Favorite song: ""Class"""
4,Early Sondheim,"Sondheim's first professional musical is not as good as some of his latest efforts, but all around a fairly decent score. The lovely ""So Many People"" is worth the price of the CD alone. While this is very early Sondheim, we hear snippets of the greatness to come (especially in the rhyming of ""Cushman"" with ""Francis X. Bushman!""). While the score and the book are a little clunky at times, this is a must have for any serious theatre person."
4,Nice little mints,"Nice taste, I was looking for something with more ""kick"" since I'm a narcoleptic, but my wife found them just right for when she wanted a little boost."
3,If you dare...,"Storyline: Morbid tale of a gay male's obsession with pornography at an early age to what develops into a journy through the subconcious mind of an S+M freak. Blood, descriptive accounts of murder and mutalation. Not for the weak at heart or guts. Comic points are Parker Posey and her hetosexual lover, but still very black comedy. I enjoyed it, but I am a little wacked out myself, so...when and roam. If you dare this movie...enjoy it."
2,Read the book,"Call me old-fashioned, but the book is so much more intense than the film..... I rented this movie after wanting to see it for ages but never had access to such movies. I was let down. Parker Posey and her lover were great, but the other actors including the lead man semmed like they had read the script only hours before filming. The book is better, (...) read it. xo"
2,See it the first time and be shocked,"See it the second time and groan from boredom. Fun, because it got made at all ... but, read the book."
1,Danger.....,"An ugly film that underscores the devolution and depravity of societies where the capitalist ethos of dog eats dog is the norm. In a land where the rich get greedier as the poor get desperate, where they shove their children into cauldrons like Vietnam and Iraq and pollute the environment until the climate goes into a tailspin, mass murderers and serial killers fit right in.I watched about half the film looking for some condemnation or warning, but judgments were left to the viewer, and that's not smart in a society like ours."
1,"Sickening, disturbing","This movie contains very graphic violent scenes including mutilation. If you are not prepared to see lots of blood and body parts, you will feel nauseated and sick. I couldn't watch the movie until the end. I still feel emotionally disturbed. Your are warned."
1,Not even close to the great book,"I have always enjoyed Dennis Cooper's books and I was very excited to see this movie version. However, I wasted my money! The actors in this movie are terrible and the story line does not hold your attention. The horror and yet subtle sexiness in the book is completely void in the movie version. I am surprised that Mr. Cooper allowed such a poor movie to be made from such a fine book."
1,Ugly,"I haven't read the book (as most of the viewers here), but I am not so keen to do it after I had seen this crap.The film is plain ugly.All the scenes of violence bring nothing to the film. I think they are just there to disgust some people and to shock others.I give two thumbs up to all negative reviews posted here."
1,CD case run over by a car!,CD arrived in horrible condition. Case was very damaged: I decided to keep the CD and replace the case myself even though the CD was also scratched. I played the CD and sound seemed OK.
5,"Awesome - upbeat, modern spin on old & new classics","This is a terrific album - filled with a variety of styles and excellent production values, Julie Silver brings a sense of joy and life to every song. Had our whole family enjoying it well after Hanukkah had ended! An album young and old can enjoy over and over again."
2,Not interesting for teaching purposes,"I tried to use this CD for a purpose other than easy listening. I used it in my classroom, without too much detail, the students had no interest."
2,"Still Waiting For My Order Too!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,","My order was placed on June 27,when it was first offered at another price. It would really be unfair and disappointing if they change any prices. My shipping est. got pushed back from July 27-30~til first week of Aug. It looks like they have more at another price. Why aren't they sending any out for those who have ordered first-1st????"
2,Still awaiting.......,I order this CD back on June 29th and still have not received it. I have been e-mailed a timeframe of July 24 thur August 5 and I have not heard anything as of yet.
2,STILL WAITING better NOT raise my price,ordered july 11 2009 still waiting aug 1 2009 ...they better NOT raise my price
4,Live in Bucharest is flawed but excellent,"The fifth disc, the live DVD is incredible. I had seen the concert before on tv and Michael performs well. Despite his lip-syncs in several songs, he can still show off all his crazy but hot moves. My friend Melissa viewed the DVD with me and she likes his talent but the shooting and editing of it seemed to bother her. She thinks it's ridiculous for any MJ fan to cry, scream or faint, even on camera. She also thinks that Jackson had gone a bit too far with his constant crouch-grabbing. And most of all the footage in Bucharest is mixed with footage in London, Monza, Toulouse, Paris, Lausanne and others to name a few. But still I like it and Michael is an incredible performer."
5,"Oh, These Haters Are Sad","Isn't it funny how sometimes...people don't have a life. I mean, this ""Coldjustice"" reviewer comes on everyday, either to add to a review, or post a new one. If their life is based on bashing a legend, then how low can they get?Obviously, they have nothing else to do. So, we minus well ignore them. The fans outnumber the sad haters. This review was helpful. Also, what's sad is that people come on to mark reviews as ""not helpful"".Another example: On the first page or so, they came back to add to a review in response to another fan. How sad.This album on the other hand, is not a rip off. Its not a complitation repackaged again. Look what it has to offer. Over 30 rare songs, and new songs.The best by far is ""We've Had Enough"". ""Fall Again"" was promoted by VH1, as it is a beautiful slow song. Take a look at the complete tracklisting. There are more rare songs, than repackaged songs. And remember: THIS REVIEW WAS HELPFUL."
5,Michael to Brazil,"I'm 22 and I'm a Michael Jackson's fan since my 10.However the box set wasn't released in my coutry, I bought here. It's wonderful and the Dangerous Tour is amazing!Whatever you got, write me soon. I've many MJ's material when he was in Brazil. The one who I shaked his hand!My email is: leandrolapagesse@bol.com.br"
3,Quite Incomplete...,"""Workin day n night"" , ""Heal The world"" , ""Speed Demon"" , ""Gone too soon"" , ""In the closet""..are some of many other MJ's fantastic tracks missing in this Ultimate Collection. It should have been renamed as "" Oops...this really isn't really the ULTIMATE HIT COLLECTION"".The album makes up for a great artwork and indepth discography and a look at Michael's career graph..the songs selected are some of his finest. But the real treat are some of his unreleased tracks..a great treasure for all MJ fans. I was so hooked on his solo demo version of ""We are the world"" i wish it were the single version.Over all if you love MJ and dont mind having some of his hits again added with bonus unrleased songs , plus an awesome DVD of his live performance. Then go ahead and buy it. Its a treat.Wish there was a 6th disc to add the rest of the lost songs which were very much essential for thei ULTIMATE HIT COLLECTION."
5,Great Value,"I purchased this item when it was on special on Amazon for just $25. I just couldn't pass it up at that price. It is a nice compilation of Michael Jackson music. We have yet to view the DVD, but keep the CDs in our kitchen CD player for when we are cooking, cleaning, etc."
5,Magnificent,"The best collection to MJ, until this date, great songs for his past with Jackson 5, The Jacksons and solo. Versions of songs not available in other cd's We Are the Wolrd for example. Only one missing song ""Scream"" with Janet. Excellent concert DVD, Dangerous Tour"".The book with fine pics and information, really good.EMTO"
5,Wow...,"Great compilation of MJ songs!!! Just got this yesterday and am really pleased with the selection of songs on this set. Of course, it doesn't have every song I would have wanted (for example: Will You Be There) but definitely has most of them. I was also surprised when I got it b/c I didnt realize that the 5th disc is actually a live concert (Michael Jackson Live in Concert in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour which is sold here on Amazon for $12.99) which I had seen before and really enjoyed. So if you want a really great collection of songs along with a concert, this is the collection to get!!!"
5,micheal jackson: the ultimate collection,"Michael is awesome, wonderful, the greatest, I'm an ""old school rules"" guy but after seeing and hearing this collection I'm reminded not only is M.J. old school, but ""M.J. RULES"" !!!"
5,OMG! Best Album Out There.,"All the songs that you could imagine are on this! This man is a living legend, and has inspired many, as well as going on to be the biggest selling solo artist of all time, with over 380 million records sold to his name.The best tracks are ""We've Had Enough"" and ""The Way You Love Me""...which is obviously some of the new recorded songs on this. Others include songs from the Wiz Soundtrack, and unreleased songs: ""Sunset Driver, Scared of the Moon, Cheater, Someone Put Your Hand Out, FAll Again, In The Back, Beautiful Girl, His Own Version of ""We Are The World"", Who Is IHS Remix.""The ultimate greatest hit is ""Stranger In Moscow"", which itself is enough to buy! Buy this. You won't regret it."
5,go michael!!!,"The minute this set is released, I'll be the first one in line to buy it! But don't just buy this and overlook his other albums, buy those too, his music is the best and will forever be remembered. Christmas is also around the corner, so buy this album for a friend, whether they like michael jackson or used to like him, they'll appreciate it either way, word!"
2,mediocre this is for the 3t identity cd,Good voices has something of the Jackson sound first song seems very slow no upbeat sound on a lot of the songs
3,Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection,Michael Jackson: The Ultimate CollectionI'M JUST GLAD I PURCHASED MY COLLECTIONS BEFORE HE PASSED ON.
1,I beg for money please....,"I beg for money please....Oh well, Michael Jackson released too many compilation of his songs that is considered to be sell out these days. I don't mean be too personal about Jacko, but face the truth, Michael needs money and he just needs money to compensate all his debts. What's the point of buying again the same stuffs you already have???? In addition, this compilation is too expensive. $[...] price, you could buy around four to five different artists' CD. SAVE YOUR MONEY...."
5,Excellent collection...,"MJ is the greatest musician of our time. This collection, which is rather expensive, is worth every penny. The new songs are for the most part good, and the old ones are just classic."
5,Wonderful CD Collection,If your a MJ Fan this is a must have but if you buy this ask this vendor to ship it in different packing because mine came damaged. The package came fast and on time thou.
1,My Ultimate Collection Order,"Where is my order?? Shipping estimate: August 3, 2009 - August 10, 2009. Reviewing the status I see it hasn't been shipped yet! What's going on??"
1,Where is my Order?,"I ordered this several weeks ago and shipping estimate was July 20th-July 24th and here I am with no shipping notice yet,only a note today from Amazon stating that due to the huge demand for this item there might be a shipping delay!I ordered this item when it was 34.99 and I hope Amazon dosen't try to force me to cancel this order because it is a higher price now!They did this to me before with the Evil Dead Set!If they do I will be buying all my items from Ebay from now on!"
4,Great Music Old and Recent!! ONE BIG PROBLEM......,"This is the second set I ordered because I had to return the first. The #5 disc would not play. The CD player in my car kept spitting it back out each time I put it back in. The other 4 play fine. I exchanged it for this new set, AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS. THE #5 DISC WILL NOT STAY IN THE PLAYER SO OF COURSE IT WON'T PLAY.So far, I have not been able to get Amazon to cooperate with me about getting just a new #5 disc. They offered a refund, but how does that solve the problem? I WANT TO KEEP IT!! It is more expensive elsewhere.There may be a bad lot of sets with this problem, so be aware."
4,present for daughter,I bought this as a present for my daughter and she really likes it. I watched part of the DVD and it seemed like it was just a live concert filmed somewhere...I'd say that it met the needs and expectations of my 9 year old daughter! ;)
4,I Love MJ!,Excellent summary of MJ's career but I wish the Free Willy song was on one of the CD's not just the DVD!
4,It's a Great collection but not the ultimate,"This collection beats all the other Michael Jackson compilation out there. But there are a few flaws. For one, it needs a lot more songs in there. HIStory, In the Closet, Give Into Me, Heal the World, the original We are the World, Scream (a big flaw of letting it out of the collection), The Love You Save, Human Nature, Liberian Girl, Earth Song (well, that's not a great song, the video was great though), and more, was left out of the ""Ulitmate"" collection. And the other flaw was the DVD concert. The concert was okay but Michael seemed to not do his best in this concert, I mean he was barely singing on Billie Jean let alone Human Nature. I was grateful that they included a DVD in it but I wish it was another concert, like the MJ 30th Anniversary concert which I still wish they would release it on DVD. But otherwise it was I liked it. It should have been called the Great Collection rather than the Ultimate Collection."
3,dropped the highball,"Anticipating a great catalogue and price guide for lounge music, I was somewhat disappointed in this publication. Too much page space is given to the discography and price listing and too little to a beautiful presentation of the covers which are so essential to this style of music. All the good stuff(photos and text) inhabits verticle strips on the edge of the pages. The covers are poorly printed with a dull look. The pricing seems pedestrian and not detailed enough. Too bad because the list of artists is large and largely accurate. Sort of a 70% effort."
5,A winner's guide to enjoyment,This volume is cleverly as composed as the best of lounge entertainment
3,A good third draft but missing vital pieces,"I agree with what was spoken above by another reader. Information on the Lamia was woefully lacking, as was information on the Road of the Bones. I understand how the Lamia were sort of just meant as parsley garnish to the Cappadocian story, but there were gaps you could drive a thousand thousand semis through.It had a good base, and I liked the tragic foreshadowing. But it just left me wanting more definitive details than were being provided."
4,A worthy addition to your collection,"One of the last and best revues. Bert Lahr and Delores Grey are in fine form. Comden and Green's lyrics (especially their reviews of the other shows on Bway) are particularly sharp. Not my favorite CD, but a worthy addition to my collection."
2,There's No Show & No Play: Just Bert Lahr & Dolores Grey,"A forgotten revue that played a half-season on Broadway. Even at the time it was pleasant though unsensational entertainment. The recording has long been out-of-print and has never generated the same demand as other forgotten flops. Without the comic sketches which were the show's high points, the album is curiously flat, and contains a great deal of filler. ""Everlasting"" has to be one of the most boring love songs ever written for the Broadway stage. Grey shines in her big number ""If You hadn't But You Did"" and shares the spotlight with Lahr for ""Vaudeville ain't dead/Catch our act at the Met.""It should be said that the music is far from jule Styne's best and Comden and Green's lyrics are nothing special."
2,Two in Poughkipsie,"Delores Grey? Bert Lahr? How exciting this release seems.Until you listen to it. Disappointing. There is onlyone song (Ms.Grey) that is worth the listen and that song is IF.Lahr doesn't translate well to recordings which is a shame. To bad they didn't have videotape back then.However, if you want to know what a generic pedestrian 50's review was like this is it. Jule Styne (without a Sondheim or a Bob Merrill prodding him) is at his near worst. It's worth a listen for a Broadway Musical Don't lesson from the fifties."
2,Yawn,"Absolutely tedious. Hardly any songs of even passing merit--this is Styne at his most generic. Worse, Bert Lahr hardly appears; this is very much the Dolores Gray show, and who wants that? Lahr's one number is indeed entertaining, but not worth the cost of the disc."
5,Thought provoking,"I was recommended to read this book by someone who described it merely, as a book that helped her find meaning in her life, when she was searching for it. I read it with some hesitation, what with its controversial title and all, and was pleasently surprised by the depth of its content. Kopp draws on a wide range of literary classics to illustrate his views on life. This allows for the material to be more palatable to the reader, and for the literary buffs out there, more accessible. It is a book that can best be described as pensive, and those that i have recommended it to feel the same way. A much better read than many of the other so-called ""bestsellers"" about life and how to face the challenges that come about. I am surprised that it has not yet already established itself as one of the classics in the realm not only of literature, but psychotherapy as well. For that it what it is, a timeless classic."
3,Language isssues,I was uncomfortable reading this book. I felt like I needed a degree in English Literature to decipher the language and sentence structure. I felt like Nicholas was more concerned with his reputation as a writer rather than being straight forward about Pink Floyd to Pink Floyd fans.
4,A bitter pill to swallow for Floyd fans,"I just finished reading this book and I really enjoyed it. The author gives excellent background on the early days of the group including the demise of Syd Barrett. Perhaps what is the most interesting are the paralells drawn between Pink Floyd and the Beatles. The demise and the reasons for the demise of both bands are similar. The author takes a very pro-Gilmour stance in the post-Waters era of the band. Although I may not agree with his view, he does an adequate job of supporting his argument. The only reason the I gave the book 4 stars is becuase it is dated material. The information on goes up to the Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour. No mention is made of the Division Bell or other exploits. This may be due to the death of the author several years back."
5,great book!!!,As a true Pink Floyd fan I can sincerely say that the author of the book does a great job in telling the story of this great band.
5,Excellent,"This book is the definitive biography of Pink Floyd and no fan of the band should be without it. Shaffer brilliantly weaves together the Pink FLoyd saga from Cambridge roots to psychedelic London to international acclaim and leaves nothing out. Where a lesser author (and fan) would have been frustrated by the band members' isolation or the spotty early history, Shaffner presses on. He includes interviews with Barrett and the rest of the Floyds, documentation of the early gigs, recollections of former managers and roadies, and in depth looks at all of the Floyd's albums and recoding sessions. To boot there is a catalog of all the Floyd band and solo efforts so you can track the band's discography. There is no bias toward the pre- or post- Syd era, just a thorough (and thoroughly enjoyable) recounting of the 30 year Pink Floyd odyssey."
3,A mixed bag,"While I find it compelling it's too anti-Waters and, being me a big Roger fan, this upsets me a little. According to Schaffner, Roger is some kind of egocentric monster whose live gigs are dull, and it's just the opposite. The author lets himself be carried away by the 'kindness' of the three remaining Floyds and this causes him to bash Roger unnecessarily. This part I could do without.As for the history of the band, it's well written besides the points mentioned above. It also features a few great photos."
2,Saucerful of Secrets,"Buy Nick Mason's ""Inside Out"" biographical book instead. Much better - great photos & the real story. This one's a snoozer."
1,Ugh! Just Terrible!,"What in the world was Nicholas Schaffner trying to accomplish? On every page he puts down either Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Rick Wright or Nick Mason. Every album they put out, it seems, is a bore, and all of the songs on those albums are uninspired. He says through basically the whole book that none of the musicians are natural musicians, in fact, Shaffner almost seems resentful of Floyds succesfulness. A terrible book, stay away."
5,A great story! Not simply the antics of a Rock'N'Roll band.,"It's been awhile since I've read it, but it's the best account of the history (story) of the band that I have read to date. Some great coverage of Syd's pivotal role in the making and direction of the band."
5,Shine on,"Saucerful of Secrets is a great autobiographical on the legendary rock band Pink Floyd. The first 130 pages goes deep into the history of Pink Floyd when Syd Barret still played a huge part in the band. It talks about Syd's ultimate downfall and David gilmours dramatic entrance into the band. It goes in depth into the ""The Wall"" and ""Dark Side"" albums and talks about how the control freak Roger Waters ultimaley destorys the relationships in the band and results in Waters departure. The book also slightly touches base on some of the projects the band did after Waters departure. This is a must buy for all Pink Floyd lovers. The best book out on this legendary band. 5++++++ Stars!!!!!!"
3,Lexmark tech support good,"The AC adapter on my Lexmark z65 just started burning. (We don't use it THAT much--and didn't do anything abnormal to it) I called the Lexmark Tech support and they said they'd send me a new AD adapter within 2 to 5 days. I was pleased with their response, but not happy that somethig so weird happened to my printer."
1,Beware,"I've had this printer for approx. 18 months, using it moderately for my personal use. Incredibly, the ac adaptor apparently got so hot it MELTED rendering the printer useless -- and a fire hazard at that. I've never heard of such a thing happening! I will NEVER purchase a Lexmark printer again."
1,Melted Power Supply,"Power supply melted after approximately 18 months of light use. Recently read several reviews stating the same problem, many also after 18 months of use. The power supply was extremely hot and a major fire hazard!!!"
1,AC adapter burned--printer no good,"We've had this about a year and used it moderately. One day I heard a high-pitched noise, and it was the printer!!! The AC adapter was burning. I've tried to contact Lexmark, but they had no solution. Now we have no printer."
5,Precision.,Very good quality and easy to handle.I was very pleased with the performance of this equipment.I'm really pleased with everything with all I had until now.
4,NorthStar English Workbook,I've been using the NorthStar workbooks for a few years with my English as a Second Language students and I've found that the content in the American English versions hold students interest as they learn the basics. Some of my kids have grown up in a foreign country and did not learn English reading comprehension or writing well. I needed to find a book that was not 'babyish' for my fifteen year old but covered the fundamentals. NorthStar was my choice based on thirteen years of teaching ESL. Parents who are home schooling must find books that are age appropriate; not just language skill appropriate. Good luck.
4,The Dynamic Duo,"When you put Paul Wall & Chamillionaire together, you're gonna get more punch lines than a Dave Chapelle episode. I never get tired of these two. Contreversy sells is a good album to listen to. Oh and if you got a bang in ya trunk, you might as well go ahead and click dat button. Great album, and a must-have for any fan of Paul Wall & Chamillionaire."
1,Paid N Partial is Pasting in Partial,"1 word, BOOTLEG. yea no doubt it is 100% koopa and paul wall but koopa didn't get paid for this album paid in partial still had songs that were koopa's before he left and put em out and pasted em on beats as a last attempt to make money of the messiah. So if u wanna hear somethin from Koopa go head n bootleg this cd, don't give phonies like paid in partial records money."
3,Good album but cmon Paid in full...,"I liked the album. In fact I bought this thinking it was the same stuff that was supposed to come out in 2002 after ""GYMC"". Little did I know that it was lego'd by Mista madd and cat themselves. They are still trying to make money off of artists that aren't even on their label anymore. I mean cmon gimme a break. All that aside, I like the cuts that Chamill did, or the cuts they pieced off him. How ever ""fake"" this album may be, it still had alot of fire from Chamill's verses."
5,"Intriguing, sexy","This was an interesting film. The chemistry is electric and Joe Lando is just gorgeous; what an actor..he really is hot. If you like a movie with suspense and tension, this is the one!"
5,Joe Lando: the OTHER version,"This film has our Byron Sully from Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman portraying a very creepy guy. I enjoy seeing actors play ""outside their type"", & Mr. Lando nailed this guy. You may want a cold drink to view, & a cold shower after!"
1,Disappointing,"Oh my, am I glad I didn't buy this movie, I borrowed it from a friend. I wanted to see it because it stars Joe Lando. I was shocked at the language! My goodness! I lost count of the times he said GD, F. D, S... I only kept watching because it was Joe Lando- if it had been anyone else, I would have shut it off after his first five minutes on screen.. Although he gave it everything he had, the script was lousy, the movie depressing, and unrealistic, especially the end, and the other three players were absolutely boring. It has a love scene, yes, but he's making it with his best friend's wife. He's definitely not Sully in this movie. I'll never watch it again. And I'm a HUGE Joe Lando fan."
1,This sucks!Don't buy this!,"OMG this movie was really short, had no plot and had a stupid ending!Not worth the $6.69 I paid for it!"
1,Don't buy this,"This is the worse iron and very frustrating to use. The cord location is bad, causes iron to easily tip; the electronic on/off goes off in the middle of a garment pressing with immediate low temp, than it drips. Worse piece of .....! Shark needs to get out of business, don't like any of their products I've tried!"
1,LEAKS WATER,"I bought this thinking it was going to be a ""Professional"" iron and it's far from it. I've had the same experience with the 2 I've received. Both of them right out of the box, filled with water, turned on and water leakes out the sides and bottom all over shirt. By the time I couldn't deal with it any longer, the 30 day return policy was up and now I'm stuck with it. Very disappointed!!! And from reading other reviews. It seems this product is constantly getting bad reviews. Lesson Learned (at least at a low price)."
1,lasted 3 uses. JUNK,I bought this iron at Wal Mart and it lasted 3 uses. It continually shuts off. I have to unplug and replug to use it. It is in the trash since I no longer have my receipt.
1,Don't buy - Power just stopped working out of nowhere,"Title speaks for itself man. I don't know what happened. Probably had the iron for going on a year + but I hardly ever used it. So in iron years, its basically brand new. I should've checked these reviews before I bought it. Too bad too because like everybody else, it was a great iron before it malfunctioned."
1,Bad Choice!,"I had this iron for a little over a year (it has a 1 year warranty) and it just stopped working. There was no sign of anything wrong before that. While it worked, I was pleased with it, but I've never had an iron that fritzed out after only a year. I should have checked the reviews here first and I would have seen the many 1 star reviews. That was my mistake. Stay away from this manufacturer and make sure you check all the reviews of the iron you're considering."
1,More design flaws than you can possibly imagine,"I did not think it was possible to cram so many design flaws into an appliance as fundamentally simple as an iron. I would not take this iron now if you gave it to me for free. I would try to protect my friends and relations from ever, ever buying one. It is heavy, poorly balanced, does not steam reliably, will only steam when near full, and is extremely difficult to fill without spilling water. The setting information is obscured by the handle, and the ""see through"" panel is colored dark blue so you can't see the water level unless you hold it up against a strong light. I really can't think of anything I could praise about it!"
1,horrible,"This iron doesn't heat hot enough, and it leaks. I'm not an iron fanatic or anything, just thought I'd spend a little more on a decent iron. I could've spent $5 and got a better iron than this. Walk dont run away from this thing. Even though some people love it, there are more people saying it's horrible. I wish I would've come here before I purchased it.Good luck!"
2,waste of money,"At the beginning it worked well. I appreciated very much it's long electric cord which allowed me to use the iron without getting an extension cord. However, after few months of light using it started leaking. Now, after 16 months since I purchased the fancy looking iron, it stopped heating up. Reading all the comments posted here, I must admit that I was lucky enough that this iron worked for that long. Therefore, I am giving it 2 stars insted of one."
2,fyretodd,"This was my third and last Shark Iron. The first two stopped working after minor drops on the carpet; our fault I guess, but other irons took much more abuse. The last Iron completely stopped working 2 days after warranty and thus, the company wont repair it. In addition, all three irons leaked water very shortly after purchase. Oh well, I'm done with this iron and purchased a Hamilton Beach at a fraction of the cost."
1,Great while it worked.,Purchased Iron and it worked great while it worked which was about a month. Now it won't heat at all.
1,Stopped working after 12 months,"It was good when it worked, all of a sudden it stopped working. When powered on, it turns on but doesn't let me choose the ironing mode and doesn't heat-up. This is an expensive one I got from Wal-Mart, what a waste of money."
1,The box worked better than the iron,"After reading other reviews I am not sure what I can add. My iron lasted a full 8 months of mild use (used once a week). One day was I ironing. The auto-shut off kicked on as I went up stairs and the iron never again turned on. It was never dropped, barely used and for the most part is overpriced junk. I don't know what to recommend but AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,Horrible!!,"Just like other people who reviewed this item, I thought I had found a winner until it JUST STOPPED WORKING!! Forget about the annoyance of having to reset it every five minutes because it automatically shuts off. After only having this iron for about 3 months it just stopped working. The lights will flash but it will not heat. I will never buy another iron this expensive and I will surely never buy another SHARK iron! I will be heading to the store to get a 10$ iron that I dont have to feel bad about throwing in the trash if it suddenly stops working!"
1,inconsistant in temperature and steam,"This iron is heavy, which is probably the only thing I like about it. The temperature keeps dropping when I am using it. Drives me crazy. I am constantly pushing temperature buttons. The steam varies as well. Sometimes it works like a champ and other times I find myself wondering-where is the steam? Also it takes forever for it to heat up. No quick touch ups with this iron. Craziest iron I have ever used. Automatic shut off is a royal pain. Honestly wish I had never bought it."
1,circuit board fried after 1 1/2 years,"This iron never got hot enough. It spurt brown steam, then the next day burnt a hole in my ironing board cover, and quit working. I'd only had it a little over a year, paid $50 for it, and after much research found out it was made in China. I CANNOT find an iron made in the U.S.A. VERY< VERY disappointed and upset. An appliance should last longer than a year!!@!!! It was only used about once a week for a couple of hours. This is ridiculous!! DO NOT BUY!"
1,Terrible Rip Off,"I have tried 3 of these irons and non of those currently sold by Target work. The first quit heating after a few uses. The local Target was very cooperative and exchanged it. The second unit didn't work out of the box. The unit's auto shutoff feature would shut the iron off after a couple minutes usage - even while it was being used. At the risk of being pretty naive, I again exchanged the iron. The third did the same as the second. So, this time I called the manufacturer, Euro-Pro. They wanted me pay to have the iron repaired and indicated that it would take 8-10 WEEKS to get the unit returned. It is too bad that their quality control is so bad because, when the iron works, it does a quite good job. This is a bad company making a very inferior product."
1,Fire Hazard Faulty Automatic Shut off Mode,"I really loved this iron. I bought it at Target only 5 months ago and I loved all of it's features. Until yesterday.My ironing was interrupted and a few minutes later, I smelled a hot odor. I thought there was a fire somewhere in the house. When I got to the kitchen, the iron was making a loud clicking sound and smoke was coming out! The automatic shut off light was on, but the iron had burnt itself up! if I had not unplugget it my house could have burnt to the ground.I tried to use it today, but it does not heat up and it is still making the loud sound in auto shut-off mode. I will have to get another iron then go through the hassles of contacting the company the other reviewers have unsuccessfully attempted. I will contact Consumers Reports and other safety agencies. This iron is not safe and should be recalled in my opinion!"
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!,"I bought this iron 10 months ago; initially it worked like a dream. However, a couple of months ago it started to leak and would not heat properly. Now, it is a nightmare, it no longer heats, and the faceplate is scorched and sticky. I babied this iron, it was never dropped or abused, and the iron just stopped working. Do not waste your money!"
1,EXTREME FIRE DANGER,"I've owned this ironEuro-Pro Shark GI490 Professional Series Intelligent Electronic Ironfor about 18 months. I loved it until last night. I had been ironing for about 30 minutes and all of the sudden, rusty-looking water shot out all over my fabric. The iron had NEVER been stored with water in it. I turned the iron off, but left it plugged in while I went to put what I was ironing into the wash. Within a few moments, I noticed a very heavy burning smell coming through the room. My iron was smoking profusely and was on fire internally. Later that evening, I sat down to look at purchasing another iron through Amazon and was SHOCKED to find how many other consumers had the same thing happen to them! Based on what I read, this should have been recalled a long time ago. It would one thing if the iron simply died, but this thing is leathal! It's not worth the risk!"
1,fiasco,"this is the second iron of this brand that i got from target. the first one i dont even remember how it died, but this one the light switch in the on/of thermostate stopped working suddenly. i guess i'm gonna have to invest in someting more expensive. when i bought it i had the feeling that the iron will die there."
5,Sharp Iron Review,"From finding the iron on the computer, to ordering, to recieving and using, it was a good experience.The iron steams well and I love it. Thanks!"
1,Stay Away,We have tried two of these irons bought at Target. The first one died after 4 months. The second one worked adequately at first but then starting spurting out brown liquid from the water reservoir. This did a real number on some of our white clothing. A few weeks later the iron died just like the first one. Just another quality product made in China.
2,I hoped for better. . .,"I've had this iron for a little while and I haven't been happy with it all. There's several annoying things about it. I don't like the grey water tank. . . I can barely see through to find the water level. I use it while I'm sewing and if I stop ironing for a couple of minutes it shuts itself off. Also, the worst thing is it started spitting water after just a few months and now it's ruining clothing.I wish I'd purchased something else."
4,Great Iron,"The iron takes some gettig use to, because it has so many great features. Lots of setting to do a great job on your clothes. If you want a iron that does everything at a reasonable price get this iron."
1,Don't buy it!,My iron is used for 3 hours twice a week. In just over two months of use the iron stopped working properly. On the highest heat setting the lights are on but the iron doesn't stay hot. Because I don't do the ironing at home I didn't discover the problem until recently. It's too late to return the iron. To have it fixed under the warranty I am reponsible for all of the shipping expenses. Then I'll be without an iron for the duration. My advice is not ot buy this iron.
1,Agree with all this is GARBAGE,After 2 months it started spitting wate and won't heat up correctly. GARBAGE do not buy!
1,DON'T BUY IT,"Today, I tried to use my iron and it wouldn't cut on. Now I am not even a regular user. Usually after getting my clothes out of the dryer, I just hang them up. This prevents wrinkles. I brought the iron in September and it is now February.There wasn't any signs of trouble. I never dropped the iron and the face plate is still shiny and smooth. It just WOULD NOT CUT ON!!!!!. Maybe the cheaper irons are better, because Lord knows, I paid a pretty penny for this!!!. I decided to look online, to see if anyone else had these problem and Whola, lookie here. I found a ton. I brought it at Target. I went on their site and there's a ton of complaints !!!. AGAIN, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,DIED,"This iron failed after less than a year of use. It would stay on for about 10 seconds, then shut off. I replaced it with Rowenta."
1,"First one was defective, so was the second","The first iron spit rust!!!We returned that and got a replacement. The new one just spit. Turned the steam down to it's lowest setting and used the ""burst"" of steam. That worked until the button started to stick. Returned that one also.Nice looking product but as the old adage says, ""All that glitters is not gold."" To be blunt; this product isn't worth bringing home."
3,Great iron with a short life,This is a great iron and I do lots of ironing (3 to 4 hours a week) but it only lasts for about one year. I have purchased it before and had the same experience. It doesn't drip or clog and makes fast work of the ironing but it also doesn't last long. I am buying another Shark that is a little more expensive...hoping it will last a little longer.
1,Rip-Off,"What a rip off this iron is...I had my doubts since the Shark Steamer that I had quit working after only six uses, I decided to use this iron that was purchased as a gift for me. (I would have NEVER purchased it on my own.) Unfortunately after about six uses as well, this crappy iron just stopped working in the middle of ironing. What a rip off from this Shark dealer. Unfortunately, the receipt is in the trash exactly where the steamer and this iron will end up! Do yourself a favor, don't buy any Shark Products.....they are crappy."
1,Malfunctions frequently,"I purchased this iron at Target about 5 months ago. At first it worked well, but about a month after I owned it it began to malfunction...the iron would turn off competely in the middle of ironing, and would not turn back on until it sat a while unplugged. Now I am to the point where I plug it in, iron 1 garment, it goes off, I unplug it and wait a while, and the cycle continues. What bothers me most is that the company wants THE CONSUMER to pay for the shipping for warranty work. No Thanks. I'm not impressed with Euro-pro."
1,HAVE A BACK UP!,"After purchasing this iron, I thought to my surprise that I had finally found an iron that would actually do the job. However after 6 months, this iron just stops working. The heating element just goes dead. Turns on fine but of course nothing. NOT worth the money!!! I've had Rowentas that do not live up to the super reputation that they are supposed to have either. Sharks are junk...."
1,DON'T PURCHASE THIS ITEM,I purchased this item about 4 months ago and low and behold last night i was ironing my dress shirts to go to work today and the bloody thing stop working...i tried to return and exchange it to Target just to be greeted by a couple of not so customer service reps who wouldn't even exchange it for one that works even though i had the box and everything...Please don't waster your $$$...
1,A real piece of junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had this iron approximately 5 weeks. I used it less than 10 times and it shorted out. Now I can't get the company to even respond to me. There are no redeeming qualities in this iron; it's expensive, heavy, hard to see the water line, but I was willing to work with all of that. I wish I had read the reviews, including Consumer Reports, before I wasted my money."
1,Very cheap iron!!,"This iron works very well, good steam, HOWEVER I have bought two and they don't last a year! I will not be buying another one! It's a very cheaply made iron!"
2,Not bad if you only need it for a year....,"Worked great...until it stopped working. Thought because of the retail price I paid ($80), weight, and steam output that it was of pretty high quality. But it mysteriously wouldn't turn back on after only year of use...not even heavy duty use either. Buyer beware."
1,OMG the iron from Hell,"2nd Iron to go bad first one replaced at store, Had to call customer service and they are going to send out a replacement iron.Customer service is not helpful and I would have thought been a little more appologic for putting out such an inferior iron based on customer reviews. I asked for them to send me a different model number thinking I might have more luck with that since this is my second one and they would not comply. Save yourself the frustration and buy something else that works. The real irony sorry for the pun is that this was the most expensive iron at the store where I bought it. I can't believe that I have wasted this much time on an iron.Run like your hairs on fire from this company and product."
1,great until it just stopped working,"I bought this iron and initially thought it was great! But, with just under a year of moderate usage it completely stopped working. I can see from reading others' reviews that this is not unusual. What a disappointing waste of money."
2,Burns itself out FAST,"I bought this iron from Sears in June 09. I decided to buy an ""expensive"" iron since my little cheap Sunbeam ones were disappointing over time. Six months after I bought the Shark iron, I noticed a strong burning smell after about 30 minutes of use. The sole plate was turning black! I unplugged it and let it sit for a while. Later I tried plugging it in again to see if it worked and it was completely burned out - no lights at all. Thankfully, I kept my receipt and Sears cheerfully replaced it with another one. That was less than 3 months ago and the new Shark iron did the exact same thing last night. I smelled something burning and the sole plate was beginning to turn black. I'm taking this back to Sears and NOT buying another Shark iron again!"
1,Euro Pro Shark Iron,"I've had two of these irons and had the same problem with each. The first one worked great for a couple of months and then when I would plug it in, it wouldn't light up and heat right away. Seems like there was a problem with the automatic shut off. After about 15 min. the light would come on and then you could set the iron to the temp. you wanted. I returned it and got another, I really liked it when it worked; and the second iron developed the same problem.After reading the other reviews about having them repaired and having to pay for shipping/handling, I just decided to buy a different iron.Very disappointing especially since it was rated so highly by Consumer reports."
1,Sore thumb!,"I bought this product at Target. I can't say that the iron is faulty; just the design of it is not friendly. It does not produce enough steam on its own and I have to keep my thumb on the ""extra steam"" button in order for it smooth the wrinkles, hence, a sore thumb with extended time with ironing. It also tips over easily resulting in 2 nasty burns from it falling on my hand while positioning an article of clothing. I've been advised to purchase a Rowneta next time."
2,Shark bites~ water droplets amd steam everywhere.,Irons well and steams great too....until you pick up the iron to rest on its base then...water droplets and steam spit and sputter right out of the iron! wow! what a show!! and what a clean-up. I am returning today and my quest for a good iron goes on.
1,Iron from hell!!!,"This iron is the useless item I have ever bought in my life. A totally waste of money. The warranty doesn't work since you have to spend $20 in mailing and be without it for weeks, even months. If you want to save yourself a head ache, don't buy this Shark iron!!!"
1,Terrible Steam Iron !,"I wish I could rate 0 stars, but you can't do that here. I had this iron six months and had a myriad of problems. The cord would only work if it was placed in a certain position (crimped back toward the handle) and then the steam would just drip all over my clothes and make a terrible mess. I contacted the company to see what my options were for a replacement, and was told I would have to send it in for them (post-paid) and they would ""evaluate"" the unit. They told me the warranty would be void since I had used plain tap water. I only used the distilled and bottled water. Never, ever purchase this iron. It's a terrible waste of money."
1,"Garbage, save your money, buy a less expensive, better Iron!","I have spent the last 18 years in the military. I Have used many different irons. This one looks the best, but worked the least. After a dozen or so uses, the Iron got really hot, melted through an expensive shirt, then quit heating up. Not it just sits there and blinks, and smells bad. Good think I bought my wife a Rowenta clothes steamer so I have something to use on my things.For the $60 or so that I paid for this last year, this think is a piece of junk and I will probably never own another Euro-Pro Shark product again as I have not had good luck with a number of their things. Do not waste your money on this Iron and buy a better one for probably less money!!"
4,Latin Aid,"For Whitney Houston, she always surprises me with how well her voice goes into many different kinds of great songs. Yet, that is a good thing, the songs are also as good, but could be better. Her collaboration with Enrique Iglesias on Could I Have This Kiss Forever is a well made duet from her 2000 Greates Hits record. The song does have a nice dance beat, but it isn't one of Whitney's best duets, but a good one. All in all, there was a original version that they recorded of the Diane Warren tune that only appeared on an Enrique Iglesias record, and not on Whitney's. Still the song does stand out as a well made Latin Party anthem, and truly worth kissing to."
4,Not Bad,"Whitney Houston and Enrique Iglesias make an interesting duet pair, and Could I Have This Kiss Forever is overall a decent song. You'd think that their voices wouldn't sound very good together because they are quite different, but I liked this pairing. But then again, I would listen to Whitney sing numbers from the telephone book if that was on her next album! She is so talented, and I rank her up with the greats like Aretha Franklin."
1,Could I Forget This Song Forever,"This song is corny and lacks any real flavor. It'll be quickly forgotten. It seems like all of the singles from her "" Greatest Hits "" haven't been doing too well. I'm quite surprised. I though she could better than this."
5,ABSOLUTELY STUPENDOUS!,"My 13 year old son was just diagnosed a few weeks ago, and we have bought multiple books trying to understand it better. I wish I would have bought this book First. It does the best job explaining CD and answered all my sons questions. We find ourselves referring to it again and again.Jewel"
4,Good overview of Community Nutrition,I found this book to be informative with many good graphics and photos. There are a lot of statistics and many internet links provided for further information or research.
2,wrong book,I was 100% sure I was buying the 5th addition and got the 4th. It makes my semester not easy running to the library to photocopy missing chapters.The book itself was in great condition just not the book i needed.
2,older ed. vs. new ed,"this book seems to be fairly close to the newer edition, but with a couple of difference. I have noticed some case study questions are different. I have really read it that much yet though."
3,"A Scholarly Collection of Black History, Religion, and Oppression Essays","After reading the first few pages, one thing becomes quite apparent: the writing is NOT for the layperson.It is a collection of scholarly essays that delve into African-American history, oppression, and religion. This was a required reading for a seminary class of mine. Most of the students, including me, confessed that THEY struggled comprehending or staying focused on the dry material. This is tragic since the African-American story is full of rich history that includes those components.Purchase the book if you want to add this scholarly collection to your personal library. But for the layperson, you should consider other books on topics that pertain to such a rich history and culture."
5,unprecedent,"I was looking for the bookin Madridand all over - out of print, it isabook that was rewritten 3 times due to incredible circumstances desribed in Reinaldo's Antes que anochezca."
3,This book is not for everyone,"I took Dr. Sandstrom's Anthropology class, and had to read his book as part of the course. It is not an easy read. One or two pages seemed to take forever, and the information is dry and very systamatic. We also had to read the Forest People by Collin Turnbull, which is an excelent book about African Pygmies. Dr. Sandstrom should have taken some insight from Turnbull's work and used it. However, his work is informative, and provides a good overview of Indian life in Mexico, its history and the changes that have taken place in the last century. I would not have read this book unless I was doing a study of Mexican Indians. Dr. Sandstrom is an excelent story teller, and it was disapointing that this didn't come through in his work. The book as a few good parts, but the reader has to slog through a lot of boring facts and figures to find them."
4,strong heroine,A strong heroine who makes the hero work for forgiveness. The story was actually good but once again the hero was obtuse and basically crazy. The story moved along slowly and it really had you wondering who was the actual hero of the story as Leo seemed a bit handsy and bordering on abuse. All worked out in the end but honestly who could say which man you were rooting for knowing what transpired between the the h and the two men.
3,Her love rapidly turned to hate...,"From back cover: Gael had easily been won by Leo Kane's handsome looks and savior faire. She eagerly accepted his marriage proposal and looked forward to the adventure of living in Indonesia. But her bridal hopes were quickly shattered when she discovered Leo had staged their marriage for revenge. He wanted to make her pay for a wrongdoing he thought she'd committed. Unfortunately, Gael couldn't prove her innocence. All she wanted was to escape the husband she now despised. She must find some way to avoid being part of his crazy scheme!"
5,Hard-to-find Gem,"This record is good one track after the other. Awesome Dre rhymes confidently and intelligently about his community, women, and rivals. The ghetto themes are harsher than the album that followed. Neither Kool Moe Dee nor LL responded to his disses from the peanut gallery. But he had stones to say it and risked alienating fans. I highly recommend."
4,A good introduction to the craft,"This is a good book for those just starting to spindle, although you might want to pair it with ""Hands on Spinning"", and/or ""Spindle Spinning"". It covers most of what you need to know for top-whorl spindle spinning. A good reference to have until you develop your own style."
4,Another strong season,"RED DWARF didn't really find its legs until Season Three with the addition of Robert Llewellyn as Kryten, who brought that missing ""something"" that that show had somewhat lacked until then. Season Five pretty much repeats the excellence of Seasons Three and Four.The continued excellence of the show was the good news. The bad news is that it breaks no new ground and does nothing new. It felt pretty much exactly the same as the previous two seasons. Nothing wrong with that, but my own preference is for shows that move forward and tell a story. So the show, for all its excellence, remains a somewhat limited show. But unlike Seasons One and Two and very much like Seasons Three and Four, I looked forward to each episode and every one provides significant entertainment.I did get a charge out of seeing Timothy Sprall in a small role.Now, on to Season Six!"
1,"Way too big, misleading description","Just got these in the mail; they are way too big for my size 5.5 shoe. Directions say 'trim as necessary, using old insoles as a guide.' Uhmmmm... thanks, but, I don't HAVE any old insoles. These were to be my first insoles. The packaging says ""replacement insoles"" but it took me ten minutes to find the word replacement anywhere on the Amazon page. Deeply annoyed. I'll be returning them, but I'm angry that I have to go to the trouble of returning them AND still have to find new insoles."
2,durable but boring rarely used toy,"I was disappointed in how much my toddler enjoyed this toy. I thought he would get a kick out of banging in the pegs but that lasted for about 45 seconds and has been rarely played with. The pegs are difficult to bang in with a toddler's dexterity. even though it is cheap, it is no bargain if it doesn't get played with."
4,Not so wonderful,"We bought this toy for my 16 month old daughter. She really shows no intrest in it. She has a hard time banging the pegs with the hammer, and mostly ends up pushing them with her fingers. I expected more from a fisher price toy. Maybe a boy wold have more fun with the banging. We got as a present a similar wooden bench ,and she enjoys it a lot more. I will give it 5 stars for being very durable. I dont see much educational value, the pegs do have shapes, but they dont come out. A basic shape sorter teaches a lot more."
3,GOOD,"Well, I had high-hopes for this one. I loved GBV's Isolation Drills, still do - one of my all-time favorites, and according to critics I've read, this one is supposed to better that one! I didn't care much for Do the Collapse or Universal Truthes and Cycles, although they made many critics lists for best-of their respective years. I would rank Earthquake Glue as just not quite as good as Isolation Drills, but much better than those other two (and everything Pollard and/or GBV has ever done). So, I guess it is their second-best. It's good (3 stars), but not quite very good (4 stars). Buy it if you're a fan - if you're not, buy this or Isolation Drills and become one."
2,Guided By Genesis,"When your guided by so many voices, they're are certainly some voices that won't appeal to everybody. As much as I adore the pop/punk/psych voices of Pollard, I dislike his prog rock offerings. This is just not my cup of tea. Doesn't mean I won't eagerly await the next."
2,Mediocre all the way,"I've been a GbV fan since ""Bee Thousand,"" but ""earthquake glue"" is my last GbV cd for now probably. Is it terrible? No, but there's so little inspiration to it. Gelatinous drone, crippling serious tone, pitiful lack of the hooks of yore, only ""Jill Hives"" saves it from one star in my book. The CDs have all been slowly going downhill since ""Do The Collapse"" IMHO and this is one that's at least half filler. I love Pollard's inventiveness but it's past time he had an editor. There's no fun here."
3,2 Steps Back,"Sounds more like a typical RP solo project. A few catchy tunes and more filler than the standard GBV album. Still its not a BAD album, just not really good. Beginning to think GBV peaked with Isolation Drills and the solo Be Kind to your Volunteer Fire Dept."
4,at 4 stars and counting,"I own 33 cd's worth of Robert Pollard+GBV, including their most recent, ""Earthquake Glue."" As of listen #3, here is my opinion of it. It started out better than ""Do The Collapse"" and ""Isolation Drills"" by a long shot. I suspected it was better than their last LP, ""Universal Truths and Cycles"", which I liked just fine, and that was confirmed on listen number 2. Also during listen #2, I started to make a very exciting realization, which seems to be coming true during listen #3, about halfway through at this point. That is, it might be the mythical return to form, whatever that means. What I mean, I guess, is this is starting to sound like ""THE"" new school GBV classic. At any rate, I'm pretty sure it's the massive rock/prog/pop album Pollard has been promising for his entire career. Postal Blowfish, rejoice."
4,With The Sound You Love....,"Great indie rock tunes are filled all in ""Earthquake Glue"", Guided By Voices latest album. From the opening track ""My Kind of Soldier"" to ""Beat Your Wings"" the album is just the kind of music you can sit back and absorb the sounds and have a good time with. If you enjoyed other past productions of Guided By Voices then ""Earthquake Glue"" will certainly bring some enjoyment.The catchy bass riffs of ""The Best of Jill Hives"" and dancing lyrics will be stuck in your head and the overall sensation of ""A Trophy Mule In Particular"" will have you thinking with such lyrics as ""I wince when you map out how to get it together"". Earthquake Glue is good in one way or another and will draw you in by that sound that was meant for your head."
1,motoraway from this cd,Long time GBV fan. This is bad. My wife says this sounds like Morrissey. Sad but true. Buy Prince Whippet instead.
4,It's about fan service,"7 schools are at war with each other. These schools have male and female fighters that battle for supremacy. Hakufu Sonsaku is new in town. Her cousin and herself are fighting to protect their friends and keep their school on top. More importantly they fight to make their own destiny.This anime is a lot of fun. It has great action, comedy, and some really great characters. It's more focused on chicks fighting and getting it on than the actual story. The plot is a bit thin and kinda out there, but interesting. You can easily get into the characters, and want them to be okay in the end. I guess that is what makes an anime good. Ikki Tousen is a very entertaining anime to watch, but as I said it's main purpose is fan service."
3,"It's no Power, Corruption And Lies..","This isn't a bad album necessarily, but It's the most middle of the road sounding effort New Order has ever put forth. They broke such huge ground with Temptation, Power, Corruption and Lies, Blue Monday, Low-Life, Technique - but this just seems to be plain and ordinary. Get Ready was still edgy, still pretty innovative, Waiting isn't quite so. It's better than most bands best attempts, but I would like to expect more from New Order"
3,Waiting for the Siren's Call,"Waiting for the Siren's call being New Order's 2005 release and 2005 release is not an alternative rock release or synthpop release. This is simple radio friendly rock album with elements of synth to it. The booklet contains no lyrics and some strange nature photos. 3 singles were released from this album ""Krafty"", ""Jetstream"", and ""Guilt is a useless emotion"". Allmusic and Uncut gave it 3/5 in their reviews whilst Rolling Stone gave it 4/5. 3/5."
4,NOT BAD,"This would make a good workout tape to get the heart going. I agree with reviewer ""BUZZ"" that the lyrics are sometimes nonsensical and silly. The music is very interesting.I get the same feeling listening to this fresh stuff as I did when I heard REM for the first time live in Madison 20 years ago. It has a freshness much like Morrisey's latest."
4,Your NEW ORDER has arrived....,"Siren's Call is a very good album. In par with their album Technique (1989) though I still consider Technique their best release. Most of the tracks' melodies are New Order tinged (especially when you hear that ""bassy-synthesizer"" sound). However some of the tracks, in my opinion, have been composed to probably please the youth of today for which I myself consider them my most unwanted tracks (jetstream, guilt is a useless emotion). But I think some reviewers will term my unwanted tracks as their most desirable listen. In other words, to each his own.For me the best track is Morning Night And Day. It's definitely classic New Order (melody wise ok? lyrically, well, you'll be the judge of that). And the first track rocks too. It's like the ""1963"" of this latest New Order release.So is Siren's Call worth it? Well, yeah. It's New Order. And if you're a devoted fan, buy it."
5,"Not quite Technique, but still an amazing album!","Prior to the album's release, rumors that this album was more like Technique led me to believe that there would be a lot more dance/electronica style tunes on the album, so initially when I heard the album, I was a little disappointed...But having listened to it a few more times, it grows on you like every other new order album and right now I love this album, and think it's their best since technique...My favorite track has to be ""I Told You So"", combining the reggae style influences with the typical new order sound...Other standouts include Who's Joe, Dracula's Castle, Guilt is a Useless Emotion, and Krafty...The other songs are good as well, with the 2nd song being the only letdown in my opinion...It's good to see them back with a very good album, can't wait for their next one!"
3,Actual rating: * * * 1/2,"After over 3 1/2 years, New Order return with the follow-up to ""Get Ready"". After listening to it several times, all I will say is that it's not a bad album. Some people have compared ""Sirens"" to ""Technique"", but in my opinion, it's richer and much more mature than ""Technique"". There are a couple tracks that stand out, particularly, ""Krafty"", ""Who's Joe"", ""Morning Night And Day"", and ""Jetstream"". The rest of the album is good, but not that good. In fact, I feel as if some of tracks remind me of Bernard's side band Electronic (his band with Johnny Marr formerly of The Smiths). On top of that, ""Get Ready"" was a better album in the sense it just rocked out alot more (the album was heavier on the guitars). With that said however, ""Sirens"" is still decent enough for me to listen and dance to over and over again. It's typical New Order which is fine with me."
3,It's good!,This is a solid release by New Order. I own all of their CDs and with the exception of Technique (without a doubt their very best) all of their CDs have strong and weak tracks. I've come to accept that with New Order. that is not a slam on the band - they are a fantastic band. But most of their CDs have some throwaway tracks and this one is no different. I still say buy this CD because Turn and Dracula's Castle are outstanding tunes.
3,"Nothing Really ""New"" Here","As a big Fan of New Order (their last album, ""Get Ready"", was a great comeback), ""Waiting For The Sirens' Call"" was kind of a let down. Overall not a bad album but there really isn't a great single on the album. The album at times gets very techno-ee (Hey Ibiza) and other times it just gets boring. Some say it is a return to their roots but if you're going to go in that direction at least make the songs better or add something new to the song structure. The highlight of the album is ""I Told You So"" with the first two songs being pretty decent themselves. There is still hope with this great band but they definitely need to regroup, brainstorm some new ideas (maybe even give us another new ""Crystal"" song) and spend some more time in the studio before releasing their next album."
3,Just misses,"This is by no means an embarassing release by New Order. But too many of the tracks sound like revisions of tracks they have already made before. And there's no ""stunner"" like Crystal on this CD. Some of the lyrics are awfully generic if you listen to them. I can't share the effusive joy that some have expressed in their reviews."
4,Grows On You...,"I've had this album for quite some time now, and after initially being disappointed,the album has steadily grown on me. The songs are incredibly catchy and seem to linger...and somehow the album returns to the CD player.**** out of 5."
3,3-1/2 stars -- New Order in the court,"I'd be lying if I said that I was as big a New Order fan as many of the other reviewers seem to be, but I DO appreciate their music. I picked up their latest album, Waiting For the Sirens' Call, and it's a good album, but not great.Some of the songs ARE great, though, like ""Turn"" and also ""Jetstream"", which features vocals from Scissor Sisters' Ana Matronic. ""Guilt Is a Useless Emotion"" is also good, as is its ""Blue Monday""-esque remix. Other notables include ""Working Overtime"" and ""I Told You So"".Everything else is okay; not classic, so I can't say the album is as great as others say it is. But Waiting For the Sirens' Call is still a nice album to play to pass the time.Anthony Rupert"
5,NO at their best,"This is one of the best albums of the year and undoubtedly one of NO's finest collections. Virtually all tracks are well constructed with a great feel and melody, and even the lyrics are pretty good. The title track and Turn are the potential classics, but there are many other great tracks such as Dracula's Castle, Who's Joe, Hey Know What You're Doing, and Guilt Is A Useless Emotion. Jetstream is a lightweight but catchy pop song, and Working Overtime would be a great live track. No weak material on this album and it really deserves more aclaim than its had. Highly recommended."
5,Old Order Returneth,"Gosh, it seems like I've been listening to this for a month! New Order returneth however and what a great return. This album sounds more NO than Get Ready and could easily replace the not so good Republic as a great follow up to Technique. They're back! Pounding bass, driving guitars and riveting techno showcase the best at their finest. I Told You So has to be right up there with True Faith and Touched by the Hand of God as one of their best songs ever.(It will make you want to play Air Techno--Is there such a thing?)The World is a better place with a new NO album.And the lyrics! well, no I won't go there. I love this band."
5,I heard the Siren's Call...,"New Order is no more an 80s band than the Stones are a 60s band. They're a band, yes, but nothing of their early music dates them to the 80s. They have a sound like no other, instantly recognizable and timeless. I used to spin ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" during college dances during the 80s, and that's where it started for me. I'm less interested in the darker, earlier material.The video for Krafty is totally inspiring. Speaking of which, the music video retrospective/anthology on DVD is fantastic as well.I'm only giving the album 5 stars because the rating does not go to 11."
3,Two Point Five Stars,"'Waiting For The Sirens' Call' finds Sumner and company working as competent craftsmen, but not as truly inspired songwriters. It's pleasant enough, but not all that memorable. If you want memorable, give 'Technique' another listen -- or even the first Electronic album."
5,Pure New Order perfection!,Kafty: the song that reignites the soul. Inspiring as Regret. Miss New Order? Want the original sounds of New Order? Buy the CD.
3,a little punchy,"A new New Order album doesn't really need commentary, but writing a review of New Order is like writing an essay on Kafka: Everyone's done it.Honestly there's been no difference between the last two New Order albums and the 'side project' Electronic (it should be called New Order II) just listen to ""Morning Night and Day"" or ""Working Overtime.""Weak point--well, lyrics here aren't cryptic enough to pose as insightful or suggestive, these lyrics are mundane and simplistic to say the least. Strong point--plenty of bassline. A New Order bassline is like a Cure synth swell or a Dave Gahan throaty gasp, it makes you happy.The title track feels old school, which makes fans feel warm and secure. ""I told you so,"" ""Jetstream,"" and ""Guilt is a useless emotion"" give us a New Order that is wonderfully dancey. Basically, there's no reason not to own this album."
1,A huge disappointment,"Don't be fooled by these five star reviews apparently written by interns at the record company. This record is amazingly mediocre, and even the most devoted New Order fan will agree with this. Save your money and stick with ""Brotherhood"" and ""Technique."""
2,Noooooooooooo!,"No! is exactly what you'll be screaming after hearing this album. Now I'm a New Order fan from the beginning, and well, they have produced questionable material before (technique for example), but this one is the worst by far! It's like a caricature of a band that was once the driving force behind countless music genres,numerous scenes, and now the 80's revival scene(...what, the fashion wasn't bad enough, now we have to have bad 80's stylised music?). For a band that made good music, this surely is the end... and it hurts!"
1,This album blows.....,"Puhleaze don't buy this album. it's just so bad. it's so boring , it's irritating. grab the last album, Get Ready. that was excellent. but New order should be ashamed of releasing this album.Their best album, is Power Corruption and Lies, of course, followed by their first one. or check out their early singles, Blue Monday and earlier.sorry to be so brutal. And yes, I am a big N. O. fan."
5,"Finally, something new leaking out of my headphones","I have been listening to New Order, Joy Division, Depeche Mode, OMD and any other pop/New Wave band you can think of since the 80's began. In the last 10 years there hasn't been a lot out there to peak my ears (Xymox has kept it alive as much as they can). Once I heard the tracks on this album (may I still call it that?) I was almost brought to tears. I am an electronic musician myself and this instantly inspired me to write again. The songs are fresh, your toes start tapping, you start annoying your co-workers with ""you gotta listen to this"". It has these breaks in the middle of some songs that remind me of DM remixes and even some Nitzer Ebb. If you like music that isn't grunge, rock, heavy metal, girlie sync dance pop and such that has been leaking out of the radio for a while now, then this album will put you right again. It's that cool."
2,Disappointing,It has its moments but this is yet another diappointing effort. It just seems like something happened to the chemistry and the magic is gone.
2,"New Order, What Have You Done?","I started listening to this cd in hope that it was better then their previous release ""Get Ready"". But oh, was I disappointed. I like ""Krafty"" but after finishing the album, it seemned annoying. If this cd is supposed to be the redeeming album of their career. The next album will be hilarious."
2,Are you guys deaf?,"I've been a huge New Order fan since forever and in my opinion their last great album was Technique (I bought this album because of all the reviews which stated Sirens sounded a lot like it). I admit there are a few songs, specifically Who's Joe, Hey Now What You Doing, and Dracula's Castle, that sound almost like they could have been B sides for songs on Technique. However, this album is a disappointment (and this is coming from someone who even liked Bernard Sumners side project Electronic). The album sounds like a cross between Ace of Base, the Scissor Sisters and the Republic album (which was the beginning of the end for NO in my eyes). I guess I'll just keep listening to my old NO albums and try to block the memory of these last three from my mind."
2,"""No"" is right - this is unremarkable disco dreck","I'm not sure why I like New Order. They've never been the most melodic band and the singer's pretty terrible (if you can't handle this opinion, you must be tone-deaf). Still, they've often been rhythmically intriguing and much of their stuff just sounds really tripped-out and cool. they've written some good songs. Some of this new CD has some cool SOUNDING music, but I don't hear any great songs and it ends up just irritating me with its monotonous wimpiness."
5,Great Album!,"Very good album from start to finish. It flows very well and it shows that even though New Order may be old, they still have the touch that ranks the music off this album just as good as the mainstream songs we hear on the radio. The best songs are probably ""Turn"", ""Krafty"" and ""Jetstream."" I love ""Krafty"" the most because of its catchy beat. The other songs are also very well produced and it makes me wonder why I don't really hear it getting any radio-play. In the end, this is a great New Order album that comes off very competitive with other bands who are trying to re-create that 80s/early 90s vibe which was started by bands like New Order."
5,spice and wolf season two(Blu-ray/DVD Combo),i loved the dvd so much thers a the rite cace and even beter shuping its just 1 of the best things i ever got this year
4,A good anime but why do I need to buy the DVD with the Bluray?,"I enjoyed this anime, it was not quite as good as the first season but still good. The quality of the blurays is great but I feel no need to have the DVDs and wish there was an option to buy a normal bluray.This uses a different, and in my opion a worse, case compaired to Season 1. I will try to avoid weird combo packs in the future."
4,Main theme : Economics?,"My wife and I first saw the series online, the title images we had seen (not this one) made this look a bit... risque to say the least.We were pleasantly surprised to find no real focus on nudity beyond 'doll-esque' levels.Really the main focus is the economies of medieval times, how travelling merchants made money etc. Its fascinating in a weird way; interspersed with supernatural mythos like harvest gods and the like. Its very interesting. Hopefully a third season is on the way somewhere...As for this particular box set, the bluray titlescreen seemed a bit off, but the video itself was great. Nothing to complain about really and it played perfectly on the PS3 as well."
3,Nowhere Near as good as Season 1,"While still continuing in the style of season 1, Season 2 lacks the energy, the draw or the suspense of the first season. Almost the entire season focuses solely on two problem the main char's face. You don't feel the same excitement or see any of the action of the first season and it comes off as rather boring and intellectual instead of suspenseful and cunning. I'd suggest renting it unless your an avid wolf and spice fan."
2,Just as I thought,I bought these after hitting two deer in three weeks. I have asked a couple of people if they worked and read the reviews on here. From the first day after installing them the deer did the same thing as they did without them. I am not just talking about once or twice but every time. That tells me this product does nothing.After two weeks of seeing deer not reacting I decided to relocate them just to see if that helped. It did not. I am not sure if there is a product out there that will make the deer run away from you instead of toward you but really this is not it. They did come as described and in good condition and my review in no way reflects any bad opinions on the seller.
1,These are a rip-off,"I worked for the State of Virginia and had to report to duty at 6am. Since I've had my car in 06 I bought a pair of these plastic deer avoidance devices and installed them as directed. I have hit two deer with these on the car, the first one in 2007 and the second in 2009. The first hit didn't do any damage, but flipped a small deer in the air and it died upon landing on a guardrail. That was in the daylight on the way home at approx. 60 mph. The second was on the same Highway in Jan 09. It did 3K damage to the car and was a direct hit in foggy conditions. I did manage to slow down to about 35 on impact. I'm lucky the airbag didn't deploy, body shop said an inch more to the center from the passenger side would have totaled the vehicle. Do the electronic ones work? I have no idea however if they also do not work expect another truth review. This area is infested with deer along highways."
3,Not what is pictured,"I have the pictured Deer Warning alert on another vehicle and was happy to find that it was still available. I purchased 8 Deer Alert--Black expecting to get the same ones pictured in the orange package and was surprised to open the box and find a totally different Deer Alert. The package is now grey/white/blue and the style is obviously different. The one I previously had was squared off on the back and the one I received was rounded. I'm glad it doesn't take a ""key"" to remove for cleaning. I just hope these work as well as the ones I was suppose to have gotten!"
1,BE CAREFUL!!!,They MAY work for DEER but DO NOT work for MOOSE. I missed a moose by inches two nights ago while they were on my vehicle. If you want them you can have them. Email me and I will send them to you FREE!!!!!!
1,Out of stock.,"I tryed to order this twice and email them with no reply order elsewhere if you want them in a timely fashion, which is what I ended up doing."
3,deer warning,"I live in a very poppulated deer area and I saw 4 deer accidents right in front of my vehicle. I decided to buy those things from target, I mount them up after I bought them because I had to drive 100miles at 11PM. I'm doing this every week (65mph)and on that night it was the first time when I almost hit a deer, I stopped about 3 ft away from the deer and it didn't move at all. I don't know if the sound of the whistle makes the deer to freeze up on my lane or these things are not working at all."
5,Bell 22-1-01000-8 Black Deer Warning,"These work! I first hand experienced & saw a herd of deer run out ""ahead of me,from an apple orchard on Route 104,between Oswego & and Rochester,NY. Safety always first. No one would ever wan a deer crashing into their vehicle and then coming across the hood and smashing through your windshield...this could even kill you! Highly recocmmend..."
2,Oh please Amazon...,"My rating is for Amazon's genius idea to buy these together for that outrageous price when you can buy them separately for 20 bucks each...The show is great on the otherhand. Lots of action and what's not to love about Ian Somerhalder?Seriously though, save your money and buy them separately..."
3,Unfortunately the best out there on the history of Brazil.,"This book is, unfortunately, the best English book on the history of Brazil. I really wanted to learn more about the history of Brazil, so I read the whole book, and I learned a lot. However, the book is not broken down by subjects, or events, or individuals, and is just written all together as one continuous stream of thought, which makes it somewhat hard to read and follow. In addition, there is very little insight into the individuals (and their motives) who shaped Brazil. I think only Dom Pedro II got more than a paragraph. This book was clearly written by someone from the ""old school."" Isn't there a fresh young history professor out there looking to make a name for him or herself who could write a better book? If so, get to work, and I'll buy your book. Brazilian history is very interesting, and remains fascinating even when presented in this dull format.Dr. Burns, at least get some better pictures and maps in your next version!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I have had this iron for less than a year and am very disappointed. The iron has leaked since I first started using it and the cord no longer retracts. When using the steam feature, flaky material gets all over the clothes. I am now shopping for a new iron as this iron has completely stopped working and was a big waste of money."
2,Good product as long as it works,I bought this iron 6 months ago and I was very happy with it. Now it doesn't work any more. It doesn't heat and the cord doesn't retract. I try to call the customer sevice but I didn't have a 800 number and I stayed 30 minutes on wait so I hang on.I think I will get a panasonic instead. They have good reviews.
2,Rowenta Cord Reel Iron,"I purchased this iron a few weeks ago and already I am having problems. With less than 10 usages the iron is leaking from the sole plate. In addition, after ironing it needs to be cleaned thoroughly as a flaky build up appears all over the sides of the plate. The cord reel is a nice feature...if it works! Most of the time you have to manually guide the cord into the housing or else you are left with 8 inches of slack.My advice is to continue shopping. Rowenta is a great name but this did not live up to its promises. I returned the iron and am looking elsewhere for something that will last a little longer...especially for the price!"
3,"All the features I've looked for, but it leaks and cord won't retract","I was thrilled to find a Rowenta with the features I'd hoped for - removable tank and retractable cord. Mine leaked very quickly after purchase. The cord, however, worked just fine for at least 5 years. Now it won't retract, but iron still heats beautifully, the steam features make for the smoothest fabrics ever, and the tank uses tap water. The leak has been extremely annoying and has caused a lot of extra work."
1,Seriously Disappointed,Purchased this iron less then a year ago. And last night the removable water tank just would not move. After trying for a half hour to remove it. I just gave up and filled the tank up using a cup. When I went to start using it. Water spilled out of the plate and onto my jeans that I was going to iron. Really a safety hazard. After that I emptied the tank and proceeded to finish just the pants and a shirt for the next day. Really a waste of good money to a good brand that has seriously let me down.
2,I think this was a wate of money,"Well, anyways, they say is shadow dancing, and that is what it is. Maybe is ok, but not thrilling. I bought it to project it in a party and it was a good wall ""decoration"" but nothing to die for..."
4,The Learning of Love: A Journey Toward Servant Leadership,"I have not received this book yet!I left an earlier e-mail stating that I had not received ""The Learning of Love: A Journey Toward Servant Leadership"" and I never heard a response on that inquiry.I have never experienced this lack of service from Amazon before.After this e-mail I'll wait to see if: #1 I receive the book ordered, which I want to receive, and #2 get a response to this review."
5,Theatrical ear for jazz? Inversations well constructed...,"Inversations just may be one of the best put together albums Ive heard in a long time on drums, piano, and bass, etc. Ive heard quite a few that dont mix it up and this one mixes it up quite well, often on some albums you get one mood or a couple and you wait for the album to kick it in the ass and go different directions the wait on this album short lived it seems as Ari knows how to put a puzzle together pretty well in his youth go along for his ride on Inversations and wear your seat belt gotta see him live..."
4,Riveting book,"Spencer Haywood's story is one that is not uncommon in sports. A brilliant career derailed by drug abuse. What I found especially compelling about this book was Haywood and Ostler's harrowing account of Spencer's crack addiction. After reading this part of the book, I found myself rooting when Spencer beat his problem and went back to try out in the NBA. A great story."
4,She finally sings something worth listening to!,"Pilar Montenegro isn't the best Latin singer out there. Her albums have always had mediocre airplay and moderate success. In fact, it should be fair to say that her good looks and svelte figure have catapulted her to the top. However, Pilar has finally released a CD worth listening to. Desahogo's first single, ""Quitame Ese Hombre,"" became the number one single in the US Latin charts and in various Latin countries. The flawless production and catchy tunes have turned this album into one of my favorites. As previously mentioned, Pilar Montenegro isn't the most talented singer out there, but I shall continue to buy her CDs if she carries on releasing classics-in-the-making."
2,ay no manches...,"perdón, pero este cd está horrible. lo siento. la montenegro no tiene voz. me regalaron este cd y no vale la pena para nada. tengo su primer disco (que salió en el 96) y aunque no es mucho mejor que digamos, al menos tenia unas rolas más movidas que ayudan a su voz. por ejemplo ""Muveme"" y ""De Amarte"" (en especial su versión remix). aunque haya trabajado con uno de los productores más importantes de hoy en día, eso no la ayudó con su último disco."
5,desahogo,"Buenisimo trabajo, el que ha realizado Pilar Montenegro con este disco.. sin duda es uno de los mejores que he escuchado en los ultimos tiempos... y cada dia esta bellisima cantante se va superando, recomendado el 100 por 100.. y no dejen de escuchar el tema de ""Cuando estamos juntos"" está genial..."
1,Asesinato en primer grado...,"Lo que ha hecho Pilar Montenegro con estas canciones se puede catalogar como asesinato en primer grado. ¡No sabe cantar! Desentona y no tiene ""timing"" musical.Esta producción no merece ni una estrella. Le tuve que adjudicar una estrella, porque si no lo hacía, el sistema no aceptaba mi artículo.Para Desahogo, mejor escuchen a Roberto Carlos.Para la versión definitiva de Quítame ese hombre del corazón, escuchen a Yolandita. Ella fué la interprete original. Grabó esta canción en el CD Vivencias en 1988. La señorita Montenegro ha TRATADO de imitar hasta la más mínima infleccion de la voz de Yolanda en esta canción. Pero el resultado parece más bien un chiste. Lo único es que nadie se está riendo, lo que inspira es lástima..."
2,Stick with the basics,We were a little disappointed with this toy. It is not quite as fun as the more traditional rainbow-colored stacking ring toy of the past. The see-through rings are a nice feature but the balls in each ring are exactly the same in each ring. The one feature of this toy which beats the old Rock-a-Stack Infant Toy is the soft plastic ball on top. My nine-month old loves to munch on it while my older son plays with the rings.
1,Poorest thing I ever bought,It did not even catch 1 beetle - what a joke. I was very disappointed and would never buy it again. The end
1,Does not Work,"We have japanese beetles/lady bugs in our house. I can vacuum them up and throw out what I trap but suddenly 50 more appear. I purchased this item hoping it would drastically reduce the population by attracting the bugs into the bag. The attractant has a delightful floral scent (obvious to human noses) but sits a good 8 inches above the bag itself. The beetles are not attracted to this. When a beetle accidentally falls in the bag, it climbs right back out as there are four holes for it enter or exit through which are at least 1 square inch each in size. Even if the bugs were lured into the trap it is ineffective at keeping them in. And there is no 'stun' factor as the description mentions. I do not recommend this item."
1,Not worth the money...stick with your local box stores for this,"The capacity of this bag is much greater than traditional bags you get locally, so you don't have to empty them as often. However, the 'ziploc' style opening at the bottom of this bag is not well made, or easy to empty. If you've ever used a similar product, Japanese beetles are stinky and the last thing you want is to get rotting beetles on your hands trying to empty it, if you don't mind then buy this bag. These bags are too expensive to just throw out after 1-use, and if they happen to collect water from the rain, its almost impossible to empty the bag without all the nastiness on your hands.I recommend using much more cheap & disposable bag you can get from a local box retail store for 1/2 the price. These my look nicer, but they all use the same attractant and do the same work."
3,Catches beetles but doesn't last,I started having a Japanese beetle problem in my garden so I looked into this trap. It worked extremely well. But after 3 maybe 4 weeks the bottom split open and would not trap the beetles anymore. I contacted Rescue and they did send me an entire replacement shipped free to me.
2,Did not catch many beetles.,"I have more than a dozen roses planted in my yard and every summer the japanese beetles destroy them. I have tried sprays but they don't last long and I wanted a more natural option.This trap did catch some beetles, but not like I expected. The way people described this was that it would be full in no time. This trap was never even half way full. I tried placing it in different areas, I read the instructions, and I kept it cleaned out, but it did not work that well."
4,Decent show pad,"First off, I received a fleece top/fleece bottom rather than quilted bottom. I didn't want to return it over that little detail though so I still decided to try it because I needed a show pad. I have a 17.5 saddle and it comes fairly close to coming off the end of the back of the pad, so I wasn't a fan at first. Tried a riser pad on top, half pad on top, and finally a half pad underneath and putting it underneath to give it more length and cushion has worked GREAT. It looks good and I love showing in it now. It's gone through the wash a couple of times and held up well. Decent pad for the price and would prob. work better with a smaller saddle to use alone."
1,Not worth the paper,Useless and erratic data. You get better information from the free access Worldbank pinksheet data base.
1,Not Impressed,"The first one arrived with a on-off switch broken in a bunch of pieces so we sent it back. The second one had the on-off switch in place, but when we pushed it, it sprung back to the off position and never turned on. We're sending it back and will not order another. AT least Amazon has been good about sending UPS out to pick it up."
1,dissapointing,"I bought this dress up set for my 2 girls at Halloween. This item is in no way worth $30.00, it's cheap and flimsy. The dress is made of awful material and does not fit very well, the shoes are dreadful. I doubt that I will ever purchase anything from this line again.Celeste SweetingNassau, Bah."
3,Is nice but...,"This custom is very cute, but I have a problem: the dress is very small for a 2 or 3 years old girl, and the slippers are too big for the dress(for a 6-7 years old), the wand is great and the wings are also very small but it matches with the size of the dress."
5,H.D. gift knife,"good value for money, excellent delivery time, nicely boxed, perfect for the birthday gift that i ordered it for. would definitely order from here again"
3,A Little Disappointed,"We are huge fans of Hothouse Flowers and had high expectations for this CD. It's a bit of a let down, only a couple songs stand out. Perhaps it will grow on us with more listening time but it certainly isn't up to par with ""People"", ""Home"" or ""Songs From The Rain""."
2,Soulful Flowers,"I'm a huge Flowers fan who feels the magic of ""People"" has never been surpassed but who nonetheless loves all their previous albums, including ""Born."" Saw them in Boston last year when they played some of the songs on this album. When the media refers to this album as ""raw"" it doesn't mean powerful and unpolished. Instead, I found the album to be somewhat light, along the lines of Van Morrison. Beyond the first track, which would only be the third or fourth best song on any of their previous albums, there really isn't much that will hold your attention or make you sing along. Much of the album is wispy crooning coupled with unsophisticated lyrics. That being said, Liam's voice has never sounded better, and the band is still more heartfelt about their music than most out there. But here's hoping they return to the heights of ""Hallelujah Jordan"" and ""At Last."""
5,A gift.,"When a melody and lyrics speak to you, it's called a gift. This inspiring beauty of an album has soaring vocals that make me run the gamut of emotions with every listen through. The beauty of this album lies in the collective writings of the band members. Each track has a different flavor with a story to tell. The musical journey that the flowers has lead it's fans down is one of sheer bliss. This CD was worth the wait from the first note to the last."
3,AC adapter,"I am hoping this is just what we need, but nowhere in the literature do I see if this adapter will work as a recharger for our Fujifilm 3800 digital camera. It only states ""in some models"". Delivery was VERY quick."
5,Sweet book for beta,"Even though it's a bit old, I found that about 90% of the book remains accurate. (This is only due to changes in river dynamics based on large-scale flooding or the privatization of land."
4,Not just for butter,A friend bought this and uses it as a salt cellar for the table at her vacation home. Never has to worry about varmints getting into the salt as it has this attractive lid! It's a beautiful addition to any table.
2,Not impressed,"The dish is not large enough to hold a cube of butter. It's a small butter dish intended to hold creamed butter or soft butter that can fill the small opening - from memory (I don't have it in front of me right now) it's between 1.5 and 2.5 inches in diameter and depth. The etching is not very prominent and did not strike me as being very visually stunning. It's a well made product however, so if a smaller dish is what you are looking for, this would meet your needs."
3,does not fit in macbook pro,"The locking insert does not fit into the security slot for macbook pros. You can force the key insert to align, but doing so would cause the aluminum sideplate to bulge.I bought another for my external hard drive, and that works wonderfully. My only concern is that this lock is not truly universal."
4,"Haven't tested it yet, but so far so good","Product does everything it's supposed to do. However, the metal for the lock seems rather thin (< 1.5 cm in diameter?, don't know what type of metal) that I often have the urge to just try to cut it myself. Unfortunately, I don't think the limited warranty covers for that if I happened to succeed in stealing my own computer... Otherwise, it's pretty light, the cable is of decent length, and when I insert the locking device vertically, like most laptops, into my IBM X60s, it doesn't make the laptop rise up, which I know some laptops do."
2,"Well-made, but too many parts.","I wish I had researched this more before buying. It's a good lock, seems sturdy, and the parts all feel very solid, but there are WAY too many parts! The lock requires: 1) pivot lock that goes into the computer (which is probably secure, but has a lot of wiggle room which doesn't give me great confidence), 2) the steel cord 3) lock, and 4) key. Way too much stuff to carry around, and too many little parts that could get lost along the way. Wish I spent the extra $20 to get a combo lock that's all in one. The one saving grace is that it comes with a bag to hold all the parts."
1,Complete Garbage! ..for Macs at least,"I bought two of these because they said that it would work with any computer. I get them in the mail and what do you know? they don't fit (Macbook Pro). I contact amazon to return them, ups comes they take the box and a week later I kid you not..! They freakin appear on my porch again the same package and everything except this time they are open!? nothing missing, but the strange part is I personally handed the package to the ups guy and like magic the appear on my porch again. What ever. They work fine for my HP laptop tho. But the design is crappy and I just am not pleased with this purchase at all."
1,difficult to manuever,"this lock is so cumbersome to use. very ""fumble-fingered"". the padlock and the device that clips into the laptop are designed in such a way as to make a quick lockup near impossible. i gave up after a week and just went back to hiding my laptop! not ideal. not an aesthetically-pleasing item either. w/ my MacBook Pro i want something very sleek and ""designer-y"" and this just doesn't cut it by any standards!"
2,Not that user friendly,"You need a table leg or something to loop the chain around, which makes quick lock up/unlock a little difficult. I don't like to lock/unlock frequently because the clip or butterfly piece that attaches to my computer wears down the lock hole on my mac. its torn up from just a few uses.Also, the padlock is squashed up at a funny angle and does not lie flat on my desk. it gets in the way of my USB port, so i have to plug the mouse in the other side.Inevitably I end up not using the lock because it is too much hassle. I could have bought a padlock and some cable myself for much less if I wanted a home-made solution..."
4,Keeps my laptop safer,"This is a good product, however, it is a 2 piece item and one must be sure not to lose the separate device that actually connects the cable to the laptop."
5,It's worth buying.,"I bought this lock because I had a Kensington combination laptop lock that decided to reset itself and I was unable to use it. The cord is pretty long so even while it's tied down to my desk I can still move it around my desk if I need to. The lock is easy to use and unlike some locks, it doesn't make my laptop lopsided. So, unless you frequently misplace keys or small pieces, this is the lock for you."
4,Computer lock,This lock is put on a Toshiba laptop and was hard to get in the slot but once in I left it and works great.
4,Will deter casual theft but not a serious one,"The piece that attaches to your laptop is a very thin piece of metal that can easily be broken by twisting it back and forth. This product is cheap and good enough to deter casual theft (e.g., if you just want to leave your laptop alone at Starbucks while going to the bathroom for a few minutes), but not if someone seriously wants to steal your laptop."
1,Missing piece made the lock unusable - NOT,"Didn't get around to returning right away, so I'm out of luck. The small piece that fits into the notebook was missing from the sealed plastic bag. I initially thought the lock just didn't fit my notebook. When I got around to researching and found that a piece was missing, it was too late to return. So check immediately upon receipt so you can return if necessary.06-19-09 Found the missing piece in the fabric zippered case that came with the lock. My mistake. The piece that ""locks"" into the notebook is pretty flimsy, but it does work and would probably avoid casual theft. It's worth $18. I would change the rating to three stars."
3,Can't get master key,"You can forget about the ""Master-Keyed"" part of the description. I ordered ten of these thinking that a Master Key would come with my order. When there wasn't one with the locks, I called Amazon and was told I'd need to order the Master Key from Belkin. Belkin then told me that I can only get a Master Key if I order the locks directly from them. Therefore, I returned the locks to Amazon and ordered them from Belkin. To Amazon's credit, they didn't give me any hassles about the return even though I had to open all of them per their sales rep to make sure there wasn't a Master Key with one of them."
5,Nice,"Nice product, very useful for locking up your computer in car or in office. Would recomment to a friend.Thank you"
4,Great but not perfect,"This is a great laptop lock but it does look like it can be cut though. The wires are hard and all but if a thief really wants to steal your laptop and has a cutter. It will not be that hard to cut. It is a great lock if you just want to prevent people from taking it somewhere. It is there as a security for your laptop. The keys and lock and the wire itself is really easy to use. This is what makes this product an above average product. Belkin products are usually good and this one just further tells me that. Overall, I recommend one to buy this if they want to prevent people from taking their laptops somewhere you do not want them to."
3,Good enough for its cheap price,"This is a very rudimentary laptop security system and just enough justifies its price tag. The lock and the mechanism looks silly and inelegant, but does the job. I am giving 3 stars because I think this silly thing could be even cheaper. Again, it does its job."
4,Not Purrrfect,"In 2010, we inherited my brother's cat. He had raised her as an outdoor cat but, here, there are simply too many predators. So, we're with her when she goes outside but she's mainly now a house cat.Lilly never got used to using a litter box. She's 90% okay but often chooses her own ""sites"". This odor neutralizer normally works as described, which is a miracle. But we have a throw-rug that was so contaminated by repeated peeing that nothing can save it.Bottom Line: This stuff is good but may not eliminate all odors in all cases."
5,SuperDuper!!!!,"A really good product! It does work! The secret is: soak a cloth with water and wife off the urine, then apply concentrate (follow the water/concentrate mixing insructions) and wipe off again. Then apply the concentrate again and let it dry. That's it! My cat peed a pile of laundry that in other circumstances I would've had to rid of. This time I just filled a bucket with water, added an ounce of the concentrate and soaked the clothesin for 6 hours. No odor residues were left and my clothes were wearable again!!!"
5,Great stuff,"Cat odor off is the best odor removal product I've found. We had a carpeted spot that our cat soiled repeatedly and after treating with enzyme cleaners still had the odor to it, especially when it got humid. After shampooing and treating with this and shampooing again the odor was gone. Is it perfect? Maybe not. I think I need to treat a small area again, but the rest of it is great. It has a pleasant smell, kind of incense-y. Foams up a bit. I soaked the area as directed and air dried and then shampooed again. Then sprayed and let air dry again. A little bit goes a long way with the concentrate. Highly recommend!"
4,Great for cat urine odor.,"Another good product from Thornell.Use this to rinse out cat boxes and after washing an area that has been sprayed/peed on. It is mild, almost gingery, and it helps a lot. It does NOT deter cats from urinating where you don't want them to. For that you need some behavior management. Especially good for catteries and rescue facilities, because it is a reasonably priced concentrate. Shop around for best price."
5,Where has this been all my life?!,"Stop looking for a product that actually works--this one DOES!I have a problematic cat whom I love desperately but swear I'm going to...well, I never actually WOULD, but when she let's me know she's annoyed by peeing on the carpet, the tablecloth, the sofa...you get the picture.I have used ALL sorts of products for 10+ years and nothing really worked that great. Until I found this about a month ago. This stuff is miraculous! And it actually smells pretty good--a bit like ginger.This product was used on spots that had no stains (thanks to the color or pattern that hid whatever damage the cat did) but awful, lingering smells--smells that had been treated again and again by other products. Cat-Odor-Off got rid of the smells. And Mouse (the cat...maybe her name annoys her...) hasn't peed on this same spots since (one month and counting!).Get this stuff--it actually works!"
1,How Disappointing,"I know, I know. I'm the only one posting a negative review. Listen, I was excited about this product and wanted to love it. Sadly, the smell is worse now.When we first applied the stuff, we thought it had worked. The cat pee smell seemed gone, but there was also an over powering ""soapy"" smell. In time, the annoying soapy smell went away and the cat urine smell returned. We then had the carpet professionally cleaned, which made the smell was even worse. Oh well, so much for this stuff ELIMINATING urine smell.If you want to try it, I wish you well! I just know it did not work for us at all."
4,cat off,"Well it's been about two weeks and everything seems to be going good with the Cat- off.The odor was gone the first day I used it in the area the cat was spraying.So I'm happy with this product.Better then Natures Miracle and other products I tried,so thank you Cat-Off!"
4,Works with repeated treamnets,"This product does work with repeated treatments.Take note, this product does have a quite a heavy covering odor to it, which is not unpleasant, similar to flowers and mint."
1,I want a review,I want to get oppinions of this cd so i may decide to purchase and know who the artist are?
1,$60 to ship an empty brush roll to Europe ?!?!,"This seller is obviously dishonest. This item cannot be that heavy and even with international shipping and insurance, there is no way it costs $60 to ship --- 3x the retail price of the item!! Are they going to have Johnny Depp deliver the package to my door? Because that is the only way these shipping costs could be justified.It is shameful when retailers try to make a big profit off their customers by charging outrageous fees for shipping. DISGUSTING!"
5,Good Product,"This product it's very handy and easy to carry. The material looks strong and pretty. The only thing I do not like to much is the little mesh pocket, because if you have a little brushes the mesh hole it too big for little and think brushes and brushes go out of that pocket, but other than that everything it's OK."
2,"I gave it a try, but I'm sending it back.","I really wish companies would actually show the brushes (even when they are not included) in the snapshot of the case. I own professional-sized make-up brushes, which would not at all fit in this case. The description said that ""one could easily close the flap down over the brushes"". This is not true. If I were to do this, my brushes would definitely be smooshed! There weren't even enough slots for all of them. Needless to say, I'm a bit disappointed.However, I will not discourage all buyers from this product. If you own just a few brushes (12 or less), and they are small/short brushes without a lot of fullness, then this case would be perfect for you. Yes, this case is ideal for someone who needs a place to store their seldomly used make-up brushes. If you are looking for an everyday roll bag, I suggest looking elsewhere because the quality of this bag is less than stellar."
5,"the prelude to ""A Year In Provence""","A lovely little witty book full of observations on the culture of unspoiled Provence...was definitely a great inspiration to ""A Year In Provence."" The writing style can become a bit tiresome..dated."
5,Maybe her best.......,and that's awfully good. If only video cameras had been around during her time. If you google her you will find a great site dedicated to her and her writings.
2,Looks nothing like what is pictured,"It is a lot smaller than what is shown, obviously. there's no navy piping around the edge, and the color is a dark cool taupe, not a light khaki.We did order this in large after we realized how very small the medium is, and the large looks exactly like as advertised."
4,American Indians Integration of Baseball,"Powers has written a fine book about the Indian experience, showing many parallels with the later integration of black players. He gives a good deal of detailed biographical information on a half-dozen prominent Indian players, and mini-bios on a couple of dozen others. There is an explanation of how Jim Thorpe might have done better with a friendlier environment, also a list of over 100 full-blooded and part-Indian major leaguers. Finally, he makes an eloquent case for the abolition of current team nicknames that demean the Indian culture.Pete Palmer, co-editor of The Baseball Encyclopedia by Barnes and Noble"
5,A Book Long Overdue,This is a book that is long overdue. The author's research provides the most comprehensive account yet written about the integration of American Indians into baseball. I found the similarities with the Black Experience to be especially intriguing. This book will serve as a valuable resource for baseball historians and will stimulate interest in casual readers.
3,From the Editor of the American Association Almanac,"I have not read this book in its entirety as of yet, but have previewed it. A friend suggested I purchase this book, and I'm glad I have done so. However, the cartoon the author chose depicting pitcher Louis Leroy was in poor taste. Perhaps Powers-Beck had his own reasons for choosing this particular graphic. However, it portrays the pitcher in a negative way and it is likely many readers will find it an offensive stereotype. In light of the fact that there were other examples of period graphics the author could have chosen, one must wonder if this decision was made in haste."
3,Good sequel to Heresy Hunters,This is yet another good read by spencer. You can read the 1st chapter online at mazeministry.com. Please do yourself a favor and get this!
1,Jim Carroll totally ruins this,"Jim Carroll may have been an interesting writer, but his abysmal performance here totally ruins the otherwise interesting audio production of this obscure Kerouac. The sweetness and warmth of Kerouac's writing as interpreted by a shaky junkie-voice is incredibly distracting. One day someone will make a quirky film out of this, my suggestion is to read the screenplay and don't bother with the discs."
1,Lol face-palm Love shin chan but...,"Let me think, pay a low monthly fee to watch all shin chans and other great series, or pay 1.99 for a single episode... Lol this is the worse deal i've ever seen. You guys need to drop the price or make it so if your a prime, you get to watch these episodes for free. Since you can already do this legitly anywhere on the internet, you'd be a fool to pay for this."
4,At last a Funny Anime series,At first I had no idea what to expect from the show. On a whim I decided to give it a chance. I was very pleasantly surprised At the clever humor. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good laugh and is interested in discovering something different.
5,Same smart-mouthed kindergartener - lots of laughs,"Really enjoy the series -wish there were more available. This DVD set is what you expect - mostly just the show, not much in the way of extras. If you like the earlier seasons, this is more of the same. But with some better short bits between the episodes."
1,All Round Lids Ripped After Short Use,The plastic lids for ALL of the round bowls cracked and ripped after short use rendering them useless. I emailed the company and received no response. Shame on Pyrex.
5,Perfect,"You can't go wrong with these. I use the square and rectangle pans for casseroles and store extra fixings in the small bowls. (you know you'll use that other half onion tomorrow!) The carrying baskets are tasteful and make it easy to bring a homemade dish to a dinner party, etc. The lids of course are infinitely useful."
4,Best book on subject on market today.,"This is a fabulous work. Well written, almost a page turner. I've read, or been reading, Protein Evolution by Laszlo Patthy and Molecular Evolution by Page and Holmes. These are good books, but left me wanting clarification and greater depth. I searched the UCSD BioMed Library and discovered Li's Molecular Evolution. Just what I was looking for. It's a nice improvement over the Principles of Molecular Evolution by Li and Graur. I note a new edition of the latter book is due out soon which makes me wonder if the new book might not be an update to Li's book. The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is the typography. The print and style of the earlier work by Li and Graur is far superior."
1,Not as pictured!,"The ""diamonds"" are closer to ""diamond dust"" than actual diamonds. The photo is a bit misleading, as it makes the watch appear larger than it really is!"
2,24 hour display limited,"I needed a clock that would display UTC/GMT in 24 hour mode. Somehow, I thought this clock would do it, as many atomic clocks are limited to US time zones. In fact, it will do the UTC/GMT time, and will allow you to set it for 24-hour display mode. Unfortunately, it cannot display a ""2"" in the first digit of the hour display. So, from 2000 until 2359, it displays the wrong time.Also, if you want it to display seconds, you must choose to not display the temperature and the seconds will display in that box."
3,eh,"Seems like the ink ran out really fast, like it was already half empty. when i opened the box it smelt like cigarette smoke, which made me think someone actually did use it."
3,Ok but not what expected,Not sure if we don't know how to use these or what... but my daughter and her boyfriend went camping and used them when the weather turned cool in the evening.. no warmth detected!
5,animal care,"I purchased these for insulating my chickens,rabbits,and dogs bedding.winter is rough,for my chicken and rabbits I layer in-between hay.my dogs I velcro two blankets together,layer thermal in between.easy to clean and keeps my animals warm,great product."
4,as advertised,"These thermal blankets are a nice size, and although very thin, they are most usuable as thermal barriersfor windows and possibly reflective and refractive radiation surfaces. If our sun goes berzerk with CME activity,you will wish you had alot of them!!"
4,greenhouse,I built a small greenhouse against my fence using plastic sheeting and the thermal blanket on the south facing interior wall. The temperature in the greenhouse was twenty to thirty above the outside temperature so the thermal sheets worked out great. They were also super affordable! The only problem is that they are very thin so I had to be careful when I stapled them to the wall.
4,"Good Audio, Not So Great Video","I was disappointed in the quality of the video of this concert. You can certainly tell it was done 30 years ago. However, the audio quality is good, and there are many good jam songs on this DVD. Vintage Marshall Tucker is always good to hear, and Charlie Daniels is always great in concert. Since I couldn't be there when it happened, this was nice to see."
3,It's Ok,"I was disappointed with the quality of this DVD. They definitely jam on the video but the quality is not great at all. If you like Charlie Daniels and good foot stomping music, it may still be worth it."
5,Charlie's nitro mojo!,"I just had to add another 5 stars to all the other 5 star reviews on here. My jaw just about hit the floor when I saw this DVD. Right out of the gate with ""Whiskey,"" the Charlie Daniels Band returns us to 1975 Southern rock heaven, with a take-no-prisoners style of stompin' boogie that had me mouthing the words, ""Oh my God,"" over and over again.Lord have mercy! This thing rocks, it should be called ""Stompin' Room Only,"" but that title has already been taken by the Marshall Tucker Band. No matter... if you want stompin' Southern rock the way it was done in 1975, you NEED this DVD. It sure is nice having guests from the other Southern rock bands of the era, but really this DVD is all about the Charlie Daniels Band AT THEIR PRIME.I could go on and on with metaphors, comparisons, adjectives, superlatives, as well as my own experiences with this band in 1975 and 1976. This DVD's intense mojo speaks for itself. Suffice it to say, it's awesome. Buy it!"
2,*Good PRoduct*,"Hey, I got my problem solved. This is a great product. It didn't take long to get here and it's really handy and helpful when I do homework for Accounting. I love it!!!"
4,Great Keypad,My Mac keyboard is one of those mini ones with the numbers at the top and none on the side. Loved that this was less than $6 and worked immediately out of the box. Makes my job so much easier.I've read several reviews stating that there is usb cable but no usb port and that the usb dongle is too fat. I've found that you can plug the dongle onto the cable and plug the cable to your computer/laptop which solves the problem.Got it in two days thanks to Amazon Prime. Definitely recommend this keypad.
3,"Good idea, poor execution for my needs","The concept is good, I love wireless devices as I hate pulling out the tangle of cords in the laptop case. So I was surprised to see the USB extension cable included. My laptop has over&under USB ports, meaning one on top of the other. This USB receiver is too fat to be able to also use my wireless mouse, and it has no additional ports on the body of the keypad to assist here. I don't really want to have to use another cable for a wireless device, and I don't want to have to purchase a USB hub with wires. To boot, the backspace key was sticking. I will return this item."
4,Great and I love it!,Arrived in perfect time and I'm in love with this! My work moved us to laptops a few years ago and I work with a lot of data entry. Its saved my fingers and I haven't had any connectivity problems.
2,returned promptly,"This looked cheep and felt cheep when it arrived. I still put a battery in and gave it a try. The number keys worked fine, but the backspace key hardly ever worked. I returned it because, as much as I hate to admit it, I do make errors and need that key :)"
2,Mediocre,I would actually recommend against this item. The range on the keypad either sucks or the item itself is faulty. I can have the keypad in my lap and my laptop less than a foot away and the keypad will skip numbers when I'm trying to calculate or type in a string of numbers. It also seems to independantly turn off the number lock key. Save your money.
3,Be wary of receiver dimensions,"I just got this product of the box and have noticed it comes with a distinct disadvantage. The USB receiver is both wide and fat, to such an extent a second USB devise cannot be plugged in next to it. I've tested it on both side-by-side and top-bottom USB ports. This is rather frustrating, particularly when my ports are in short supply.This product does come with a USB extender, which is sized to more standard dimensions and will fit more comfortably with other devises in the ports. Still, I'm disappointed that I need to use and handle wires in order to have this wireless devise perform optimally."
4,"A funny deal, but it seems to work fine","First off, how could you complain when it works and it cost >$7. It's a little weird though. It came with a usb cord, but the devise does not have a usb plugin. (oh well, an xtra usb cord) The wireless usb plugin is a strange shape and size, but it works. It is large and if you only have two side-by-side ports on your laptop, you probably won't be able to use the other one. The keypad hints at quality with four little non slip rubber feet on the bottom, but it's not level, it wobbles ever so slightly when in use. I actually shopped a little more after I received it to price one with a large plus key, like a desktop keyboard, but they were generally <$25. I was just looking at the package, it says, ""System requirements: Windows 2000, Me, XP, or Windows Vista"" (does not include windows 7) A carrying pouch is included."
5,Great Product,We are very happy with the wireless stow n go keypad. Keypad is very comparable to an actual computer keyboard keypad.
2,Poor Operation,"The keypad is unreliable. It often registers only about 2/3 of the keys pressed, and at best still misses a key here and there. The included USB cable must be used to ensure proper performance, which of course defeats the purpose of buying a wireless device. The range varies each time I tried to use it, sometimes it would work a few feet away (the 3.3 ft. range claimed by Targus), but often it had to be within 12 inches of the receiver to work. I actually purchased 2 of these Stow-N-Go keypads and had the exact same problems with both. I give it two stars, not one, because under the perfect conditions it worked all right and for that brief time it was nice to have a wireless device. I'm returning these for a refund."
2,Skips numbers / USB receiver takes up too much room,"I noticed patchy performance. I have a USB wireless logitech keyboard, that works perfectly. On the same desktop, this number keypad is almost non-functional. Will be returning it. The USB receiver is relatively thick/bulky - hence the adjacent USB port on the computer tower is lost due to the size of the Targus USB receiver.This was my first Targus purchase and its not impressive to say the least."
3,Acceptable but......,I've been using this keypad for a couple of years and definitely agree with the range issues mentioned by other reviewers. Within 2 feet seemed to be the working range and anything outside that was iffy. I really like the 00 key that many others don't have. It died when I tried to blow dust from around the keys with compressed air. That shouldn't have happened.I'm looking for a replacement but it will not be this model.
3,Slush in the desert,"Though the backdrop of Taos supplies much that is rich and rewarding, getting through this book is more like wading through slush. It needs tighter editing and stronger writing. We don't find out much about characters from their behavior; the author supplies all that stuff. We get lots of details about meals and wearing apparel, but it has nothing to do with the nominal plot. One can be optimistic and look forward to increasing strength in the writing with future books."
5,"Clear, concise, excellent","I especially enjoyed the video because the saw Mehler uses is the one I own. The instruction is very clear and easy to follow. This video should be viewed by everyone before they ever use a table saw and by those of us who have used one for years. I now know how to get the most out of my saw; maintain, calibrate and use my saw safely. I also now know how to make some inexpensive accessories. Own a table saw? Watch this video."
1,THE WORST FOR BEGINNERS,This is tape is so bogged down in details. It is not for the person looking for clear advise. I bought it because I wanted the basics for using our table saw. This was not helpful.I bought two other woodworking tapes that actually showed me how to do a simple project....dovetail...and make a groove. This film is also VERY boring! No fun here. I would not recommend this to anyone who is just starting out.
3,Do NOT Buy,"This toy was given to me as a gift- and at first I thought it was adorable. However, some of the toys are too small and a choking hazard. The worst thing is that the material is so cheap on the animals that as the baby chews them the color will come off in their mouth. Babies do love to chew these animals- my daughter loved chewing them- until I threw it away because of her mouth turning purple! Beware- it is a very expensive toy and your money would be much better spent elsewhere. Mommy of 2"
2,Waste of Money,Received this as a gift and the animals were so small it became a choking hazard. I wound up not even letting my six month old play with the toy and eventually threw it away when my eldest lost all the animals. Now that I see how expensive the toys was.
4,Enjoyed this book,I especially enjoyed this book because it gives me insight into the development of characters in so many of Greeley's novels.
5,A most Fearful Master,This is an excellent book regarding the formation and intent of the United Nations. The author's understanding and predictions are very clearly seen in the current headlines. This takes some time to read through in order to piece all of the details together. Can be used as a study into the UN and how the US has been played on the world stage.It will make the reader think about the current world events now unfolding.I highly recommend this as mandatory reading for young adults in High School and College.
3,it's Okay,"Based on the label, I was led to believe that this product was organic but nonetheless, these granules are very tasty when chewed."
1,fish,"this stuff i waited for and when i finally got it, opened it up, taste it - well it tastes like fish - refund!"
4,bee pollen an aquired taste,"I've read a lot about how good bee pollen ins for you and such. Having a slow thyroid thought I would give it a try. It didnt give me anymore energy (like its said to do) however not much does and im only at a teaspoon a day. Its pretty hard to get down, I added it to honey and the flavor is strong so it comes right through. Its giving me vitamins though naturally. Some people like the taste and some dont. At first it tastes alright, but after a couple chews it taste kinda like hay smells (if that makes any sense). Now I love the smell of hay, but taste is a diff story. Going to try it in a fruit smoothie soon."
1,Not what I expected,"Unfortunately, the self-stick strip is narrow and leaves a large unattached flap all around the edge. I need to use transparent tape to secure before mailing, costing me time (and tape) I thought self-stick envelopes would save. I regret having to write a negative review but this product did not live up to expectations."
1,Poor Quality,I was very disappointed with these envelopes. The glue on the strip does not stick at all. I have had to tape the envelopes closed. Plus they were overpriced which I probably wouldn't have minded if they stayed closed. Not a recommended purchase.
2,"the self-adhesive thing is a nice idea, but...","The adhesive gets weak as it quickly ages. I've had some of these for a couple of years and their glue has weakened to the point that the envelope can be easily peeled open without tearing it.As another reviewer noted, the adhesive doesn't reach the edges of the flap. This is also a problem.The quality of these things does not justify their price."
5,Should Be Required Reading Right After Baptism,"E.M. Bounds is one of the best writers on prayer. It's not just that his books are powerful from their exegesis of Scripture on prayer nor that they rock your theology with incrediable insights into how God's answers prayer but they are mighty simply because Bounds lived what he taught. Most of his books were written after his death because Bounds was not a writer but a pray-er.This book is the best single work by E.M. Bounds because it combines all his works on prayer into one volume. While the volume is quite long and I don't know of any disciple who can read this in one setting or even in a month because of the heavy conviction they bring. Bounds is no 21st century, easy gospel, seeker sensitive type preacher but his passion is for Jesus through the power of seeking God's face!I also highly recommend the works of A.W. Tozer, Leonard Ravenhill, and Samuel Chadwick on prayer."
5,Civil War Prayer Warrior,"This is a great book and recommended by pastors, professors and missionaries everywhere. Get it and read it now, okay."
5,Inspirational! Get hold of God!,"This book is phenomenal! Bounds, in eloquent prose, demonstrates how essential prayer is to the believer. I have grown so much in my spiritual walk with God because of this book. If you want to get hold of God, read this book and learn how. It is absolutely vital!"
2,"No, No.....","I did not like the book. It does not have KJV verses and it is totally different to the one that i have. It was translated to a contemporary languange and the one from E. M. Bounds translations is alot easier to read than this one. This book was to be a gift for my sister. I wish i could return it . But i don't have a printer to print out the return label , so , i guess i have to count this as a loss in my part. Oh well live and learn. The book will just stay here unread and new. =( Or i will take it to a bookstore where they buy books.... Thank you."
5,Awesome,This work is timeless and very convicting! To get all 8 books for that low of a price is almost thievery!
5,powerful and convicting!,"I have this book on my shelf in hardback and for years have intended to read it. After purchasing a Kindle this was one of the first I downloaded. Once I started reading there was no stopping. Powerful words on prayer. Convicting words on prayer. Some have said they would not read Bounds because it is ""an old book."" Yes it is ""old"" in years published, but his insights on prayer are ageless. Read it... it will challenge and change you."
4,Great Trailer for the Price,"I use this trailer/stroller on a weekly basis either for jogging, bringing my 2 year old son to the store, or hauling groceries. It is fabulous! It is light-weight, but sturdy and it handles corners and bumps well. My son even loves riding in it! He prefers it to his mounted bike seat. One warning: when loaded with groceries or other weight, do not allow the bike's kickstand to support its weight. Balance the weight in the front and the back loading area of the trailer and get on your bike quickly. Otherwise, a great buy!"
4,Good Not Great,Seat: Hard to get baby to sit upright without sliding downSeat belt: Not great as baby can easily slip between the straps and become looseBack very upright which makes it almost impossible to make a helmet sit good on head a sit pushes the head forward in a very awkward position.We use it frequently and enjoy it despite the not perfect parts.In all a good value for it's price.
4,Great for the money,"I did a lot of research and decided to purchase this trailer after reading good reviews. We do light bike riding as a family and we wanted a way to be able to do this with our 20 month old daughter. We did not want to spend a ton of money for a high end trailer that we would barely use. I picked this trailer as it has a lighter frame then the lower model. I have been pleased with the trailer. It has quite a bit of storage and is very easy for me to pull behind my bike. My daughter likes seems to like it too. My only complaints are that the seat sags a bit as there is no reinforcement. Not really a problem just maybe not super comfy. Also, the clips are quite a pain. Instead of buckles the harness uses clips which are quite difficult to undo at times. I do recommend the trailer for someone who does light recreational bike riding and wants to bring kiddo along. Now, if I could only get her to be ok with the helmet!"
5,Great value for the $$$$,I love this trailer. It is a good addition for me as it is not heavy to tow; even with two children in it. It has some room in the back for storage and can be used as a stroller as well. It is great. I would recommend getting one!
2,"Cute, but not very useful.","The illustrations in this book are neat and the CD helps but there are virtually NO pronunciation guides and the dialogue in the CD is frighteningly fast. I could say ""hello"" and super basic stuff but even for the casual learner this books fails, in my opinion."
3,"Just the Facts, Ma'am","You get what you pay for...the price was right so I thought I'd give it to help a friend understand me when I rant a bit as I speak Gaeilge myself. This book gives you just a few stock phrases in a variety of situations, many of which would be rare to the individual making a first trip to the Gaeltacht. At best, it gives you a few polite one liners, but doesn't give you enough to engage in much of a conversation with anyone."
2,Yikes...not good for beginners,"I have searched high and low for a WORKBOOK on the Irish language. I was under the impression that this was more of a workbook, and was disappointed when it arrived to see that it wasn't. This would have been OK had the CD been of any use. It went so fast that I was a few pages behind by the time I realized what was going on. Also, there are no pronunciation guides, and HELLO have you seen the Irish language?? It's made up of letters that make sounds OTHER than what that letter represents, and there are often several silent letters littered about.This is more of a second or third level Irish instruction book."
4,What historical fiction should be,"Cecelia Holland's unusually spare voice gives freshness and literary distinction to a genre often overwhelmed with schmaltz. This story of medieval Europe is cold, violent and unromantic, but never fails to grip the reader."
3,Interesting but not for every fly tyer,"The book is a big compilations of flies that people sent to a magazine. So some flies are more to show the beauty and skill of the tier than to catch fish. For that reason this book is not for a beginner tier. Anyway is a nice book to have to learn innovative flies and techniques. When I see a a book with non traditional flies, I want to tie them all, I thought that this book that all the flies are non traditional would mean me hundreds of hour in front of the vise trying to tie 1000 of the 1500 flies on the book... but doesn't happen, but still the book has lots of interesting flies. I recommend the book but have in mind that you will not have 1500 flies for fishing, but you can learn lots of good flies and have more tools to create your own patterns."
5,My New Favoirite,"I had heard of Matt a few months back, but was not able to buy his album until I saw him live in concert with Dave Barnes (another great artist to check out). I haven't stopped listening to this album since. His voice rivals that of John Mayer and his guitar skills are incredible. The album is musically and lyrically solid. There are a pretty good mix of tracks with a good grove as well as those mellow acoustic tracks that you can fall asleep to. Find a way to get your hands on this album!BUY IT, BUT IT, BUY IT!! You won't be sorryalso: his live show is great- the guy is hysterically funny and he loves what he does. Don't pass out the chance to see him live!"
5,Bake like a pro.,"This is a collection of the most popular sizes, it is easy to cleanup, and the weave pattern adds a little flare."
2,AfriKa Ka-Ka-Ka-Ka-Ka-Ka-Ka-Ka etc.,"If you like tunes that sound like a record stuck in the same groove - by all means buy this EP. All others stay clear.To be fair there IS some interesting stuff here, but you must suffer through the constant stuttering of AfriKa, Ka-Ka-Ka-Ka-Ka-Ka-Ka-Ka... well, you get the idea."
3,where are the old chemical brothers...?,"Well... this is a chemical brothers single, so obviously it isn't terrible. That said, It Began in Afrika is definitely a disappointment. Gone is any trace of the sounds that originally defined their work. Their formerly dynamic breakbeats have been suplanted by rather boring house drums and the industrial crunch that gave their best work (DYOH and Loops of Fury) its edge is nowhere insight... And the vocal sample used over and over again seems unusually weak compared to previously stunning sampling cut and past jobs. So, I can't really get too excited.Hot Acid Rhythm 1, the b-side is actually easily my favorite song on the single. With a tighter arrangement and some nice breakbeats, this hearkens back to much earlier chemical brothers work, and gives me a ray of hope for the upcoming album... Hopefully, they will manage to fuse their newer sounds with some of the older breakbeat work that originally gave them their soul."
3,Good but not as great as reviewed,"I was so excited to grab this new CD single after reading the reviews. I guess it is a matter of taste but I am disappointed in what I got. I think I let the hype get to me. I especially do not like the third song on the release, Hot Acid Rhythm 1. It is not typical of what they have done on previous albums but would probably appeal to those who love acid music. I like the new single but as far as I am concerned it is not their best work. The drums are great but I get a little tired of the ""it began in Africa"". They take a sample from Jim Ingram's ""Drumbeat"" which reminds me of Michael Viner's Incredible Bongo Band song Apache and build the song around it. The sample is funky and ""It began in Africa"" is growing on me but something is still missing. So the bottom line is that it is a good CD single but not worth five stars."
4,Essential,"A fascinating look at the production histories of three classic Westerns -- ""High Noon"", ""Shane"" and ""The Searchers"". The author Michael F. Blake is not just a respected film historian, he's also an industry professional. (He was a child actor and later became an award-winning make-up artist -- and his father was an actor who had a supporting role in ""High Noon""!) So he knows first-hand how movies are made and brings that knowledge to his well-researched accounts of the making of these three films. Some readers may be less interested in Blake's extended thematic analyses of the films -- but for its behind-the-scenes insights into the creation of the films, this book is an essential contribution to the history of the movie Western."
5,Great for Shine,"I was really impressed with this conditioner. The shine and softness is really noticeable. I experiment a lot with conditioner and I've been using this brand for months. Far longer than any other purchase. I'm a male with normal hair. I heard if you have oily hair this may not be the best choice, but I cannot speak to that. This conditioner makes your hair look like the conditioner commercials for reasonable price."
2,Shiseido Tsubaki Conditoner,"Great smell but too heavy, left hair feeling limp and greasy. Arrived quickly and came as described but just not for my fine hair, might be better for thicker coarse hair."
4,Hard to find,"I was happy to find that Amazon carries the Shiseido hair products after initially purchasing at an Asian grocery store. It is reasonably priced compared to similar salon products. If you flat iron the shampoo along with the conditioner will make the task much easier. The shampoo has a great lather and the conditioner will make your hair shine. Also, there is a damage repair version of hair care available. Only reason not rated a 5 is there's always room for price improvement."
1,Totally useless,"I bought this because I was told by someone at the R. A. Allen Co. that this would work with their Bike Rack, model 440RR. It turns out that I was lied to or was given an answer by someone who did not know anything. It does NOT work with Allen's own bike rack!!!!! The cylinder is too thick (i.e. the diameter of the cylinder is too wide) to fit through the hitch insert hole.This item will NOT work with Allen Bike Racks and company will not return your phone call or help you in any way!!!!! (I called them twice and left two messages with an Alex, who has never returned my phone call.)I will never buy another item from the R. A. Allen Co. again."
1,Not for Allen bike racks.,"This bike rack lock does not work on the Allen bike racks. The description for this item didn't make that clear for me. Called customer service and they told me it is not an ""Allen"" bike rack lock even though it labeled as an Allen item and is sold by Allen. The Allen rack will wobble."
2,do not use for a travel guide,"This book is awesome for education. But horrible if you are relaying on it when traveling in Poland.I usually buy the ""DK Eyewitness Travel guide"" books but could not find one for Poland so I got this one.. and was very dissapointed in it. Compared to the ""DK eyewitness travel guides"".. it stinks."
3,Good Story but Typos were distracting,"While the storyline and characters were enjoyable in this book, the typos were distracting or at least there were enough of them to be quite noticeable. The most common misspelling was ""cel"" instead of ""cell"" as in cell phone ... I counted at least 5 misspellings of this alone. I am a freelance writer and also write grants and press releases in my ""real"" job. If I had any misspellings in my work, I would lose crediblity. I will give another chance or two to this author before ""writing"" her off in favor of someone with fewer typos. Like I said, there were enough to be distracting, thus taking away some of my enjoyment of the storyline."
5,Gazoobo Shape Sorter,"We ordered this for our grandchildren, and they are enjoying it very much. We appreciate the timely service of the shipper and good quality of the product. Thank you."
4,They still make this?,"I loved this toy as a kid, I'm so happy that now, 20 years later they're still making them!! I can't wait to buy one for my son so he can share the fun! Every kid should have one of these"
3,Too frustrating!,"I thought this was the cutest (and most educational) toy! - was I wrong! The idea is cute, but it is sitting in my garage waiting to be thrown out. After the first few weeks, the doors stopped closing because the locks malfunctioned. You have to get them to just the right spot, and not move the toy, in order to keep the pieces inside. Also, the edges on the top are rough, so when my son's little sister would try to put her hands inside, they would get all scratched up (and that's on the times her hand DIDN'T get stuck). Cute idea, but the quality isn't there."
1,Dangerous sharp corners,"I do not recommend this toy. By the time your child is old enough to manipulate the tiny keys, they will find the presentation too juvenile. More importantly, the edges are dangerously sharp."
1,A concerned mother and aunt,"My niece received this toy for Christmas. I was very disappointed with the safety of this toy. The edges are too sharp. After playing with it for 5 minutes, my daughter got her finger caught in one of the doors and screamed for 10 minutes. I would not recommend this toy to anyone. We are going to return it and get something safer."
1,There are better shape sorters,"The animal shapes are barely recognizable at the top of this Gazoobo and too difficult for a toddler. My 2 year old loves the key ring, but fitting the small keys into their respective small key holes is beyond her toddler capability. There is no provision to attach the key ring to the gazoobo, so the parts cannot be stored neatly together. The Chicco Crank n Spin is much more fun and easier to use. The classic Tupperware, blue and red, shape sorter is best for more advanced sorting. I do not recommend the Gazoobo."
2,Consider others for young toddler,"We purchased this toy when our toddler (age 2) was ready to do more than just sort shapes -- we were attracted to the keys and the color coding. Unfortunately, the keys are too intricate and the shapes are too weird and/or close-fitting for easy use. Oddly, the complex animal-shaped holes are on the roof of the house while the simpler holes are on the doors where they are harder to reach. We shelved the Gazoobo and purchased a similar toy with simpler keys and shapes. The Gazoobo may come out again at 30 or 36 months."
5,My Son LOVES his Gazoobo!!,I bought this for my son for Christmas 1998 and thought it would still be several months before he was able to play with it very well. He fell in love with it and within 4 months had mastered all the shapes and learned his colors from it!!! I wish Amazon had had toys back then because I paid a bit more for it than they ask for it! This toy is really durable because my son tends to throw all his toys and this one hasn't broken yet!
5,The must-have bookk for any dolphin lover,"This is a must have book for any dolphin lover. It is in full-color with numerous full-page photographs of dolphins by various photographers. It is also packed with many fascinating facts on these intriguing & beautiful creatures. Information is given on the dolphins' origins, physiology, intelligence, eating habits, birth, & death. The lives & characteristics of oceanic, river, and coastal dolphins are also detailed. Next, environmental issues & research as well as the authors' personal experiences with dolphins are discussed. Wonderful photographs show many different species of dolphins in a wide variety of situations. A great illustrated chart showing over 30 dolphin types in also included. Many dolphins shown are quite unusual like the pink Boto & Atlantic spotted dolphin. A chart in the back gives details on the attributes & location of each one."
5,Great Dolphin Resource Book,"This book is an excellent resource on dolphins, and the photographs are incredible. There are descriptions of all kinds of dolphins, from the well-loved bottle-nose to the lesser-known river dolphins. A must have for anyone who loves dolphins and wants to learn more about them!"
3,"Overall disappointing, but worth owning","If you are looking for a general guide to prices for Japanese Woodblock prints this is not it. I was expecting a much more comprehensive listing, or at least a discussion about how these prints are appraised, but there are only a few price points mentioned. There is quite a bit of useful information, but this is not the good, introductory text that I was hoping for.At one point the author says something to the effect of: ""if you want to learn about Japanese Woodblock prints, go to a lot of galleries and read a lot of books on the subject."" I think I kind of knew that before."
1,"Nice guide, but where did she get those prices?","I found this book somewhat helpful and useful. But there is something terribly wrong with it, which makes me highly dubious of the writer's motivations. The prices are outrageously high. Every dealer I have talked to, while delighted at the inflation of values for obvious reasons, agrees that the prices are often twice or more the true market value of the prints. I have bought several of these prints in near mint condition in the past year for half the prices quoted here. I suppose I should be delighted that my purchases doubled in value overnight, but .........."
3,Not too bad...,"...but indeed, where did she get those prices????? Still a good reference that provides loads of helpful information. A good addition to your Lane, if you are deeper into Ukiyo-e. And the price is absolutely reasonable for the amount of information provided. One of the few references that do not only give information about the classical artists, but also on sosaku hanga and shin hanga artists."
1,lacks depth,"I was disappointed with this book. I guess I had expected a fairly comprehensive survey of auction, retail, and internet prices but this contained only brief selections from important artists, e.g. five by Hokusai, three by Harunobu, a dozen or so by Hiroshige. And I agree with another post here about pricing; some estimates are dead on, but many estimates for things I've shopped for or purchased are at least double current retail."
1,WE STILL NEED A COMPREHENSIVE VALUE GUIDE,If only the content could have delivered on the promise of the Title. I think REDO would be in order.
5,Excellent source of information on many dog topics,This book has lots of different situations and problems that you might encounter. It is extreemly helpful and easy to use. There is a lot of love in the methods that they recommend so you don't feel bad using them on your dog. Very practical advice for a person who works and or has children!
2,disapointing,"since i've never heard of it, and being an american of irish-catholic decent naturally i was excited! with an amazon ""5 star"" rating, i was ready for something like ""in the name of the father"" or ""michael collins"" or like caliber. unfortunetly this film (athough somewhat interesting) was nowhere near that quality. this film once again proves my theory,""If you've never heard of it there's a reason for it!!!"
1,diss-apointed,"I MUST TELL YOU, I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED WHEN I RECIEVED THIS PURCHASE. I HAVE THE FIRST TWO VOLUMES AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE GREAT, THIS ONE ONLY HAS EIGHT TRACKS ON IT AND THEY SEEM LIKE THEY ARE INSTRUMENTALS, NOT BREAKS OR BEATS TO SAMPLE. THE BEATS ARE TIGHT BUT NOTHING LIKE THE FIRST TWO VOLUMES THAT HAVE A LOT OF MATERIAL TO USE. I HIGHLY SUGGEST NOT BUYING THIS CD. SAVE YOUR MONEY. I DO RECOMMEND THE FIRST TWO."
5,All Cocks Sychronized,"I have just opened a doctor's office with four exam rooms. I want to have a clock in each exam room. I am very sensitive to noises and can't stand some cheap clocks that go tic-tic-tic! The main reason I bought these digital clocks was because of their large numbers. Once I put them up, I realized an unexpected benefit - all these clocks are synchronized! I no longer have to wonder which clock is telling the real time...Other benefits: They show the temperatures in each room. They show the date & day of the week. The clocks adjust themselves for day light saving time. Maintainance should be a breeze - just change the batteries once a year and they should take care of themselves!"
3,Good For 12-hour Mode.........Not Good For 24-hour Mode,"This clock has extra large numbers which can easily be seen from across a room.I purchased the clock with the intention of using its 24-hour mode. Once it reaches 20:00, however, it cannot display the ""2"".....Instead, it shows a vertical bar that is about 1-inch tall, which is disappointing. According to the instruction manual: 'Note: The ""24 hour time"" option is not recommended. The LCD display will not show the first digit ""2"".'Nowhere in the Product Description or the Amazon.com Review is this shortcoming mentioned.Bottom line: If you plan to use the 12-hour mode, this clock is an excellent choice. But if you plan to use its 24-hour mode, my advice is to look elsewhere."
2,"Lifetime warrenty for knife, not altimeter","I loved this little guy...but after about 2 years of *really* gentle use--day hikes, an overnight or two, skiing--the electronics went haywire and the screen compartment started to get condensation in it....the electronics aren't covered by the great warranty, only a very limited one. If I had seriously used this in the back country, I doubt it would have lasted a year."
2,Victorinox Altimeter,"First off. The knife is great. I wouldn't expect anything less from swiss army. only bad part about the knife is that the altimeter has an accuracy error margin of about 75%. And since this is both the title of the knife and the main feature of it, I give the knife a two. Only because you can get a knife just like it without the altimeter that works just as well."
3,Metal has some sharp edges,"Face is a little hard to read as all markings are gold, except for day / date.Clasp is harder to open and close than earlier versions of Seiko watches."
4,Mothers present,"i have to say this is a pretty good watch i got it for my mother for her birthday, shipping was fast, and the watch came with a lot of extra links"
5,Excellent product,This is an excellent watch. Seiko has made this watch for over 30 years. Last one lasted 25+ years. Very stylish.
5,Excellent if you read the whole thing,"Fr. Melina has done the Church a true service by plotting a viable path for the much needed renewal of Moral Theology. Moving beyond the theology of the manuals, Melina presents a fresh approach to Moral Theology that is faithful to Sacred Scripture, Sacred Tradition, and the scholastic fathers. He especially explains how his vision aligns perfectly with Pope John Paul II's encyclical teaching in Veritatis Splendor (The Splendor of Truth, 1993). Not an easy read, but worth the time and attention you will afford it."
2,Voyager,Had one at work that i worked very well. This one has not functioned properly and I am not satisfied.
2,Interesting piece the way it was shipped,"Product was shipped to me on time. But I don't believe it was a new unit?? The packaging was not done properly and the headset was ""flopping"" around inside the box when it was shipped. No directions of setup were sent with this product and the date code on this unit was a 2001 manufactured date. All the above represents that this was not a new out of the box product. Not happy and I still may return the product if the end user has a problem setting it up and fully utilizing this product. Also overpriced for an obsolete product at this point! MP"
2,Weak range / Static as you get away from the base,"I just got a brand new Voyager 510S. First of all, it is not a bad quality headset. It seems like Plantronics retrofitted the CS55 Base for the bluetooth technology. However the problem with the Bluetooth is the weak range. You start hearing a lot of static and degraded quality as you walk away from the base. This is a real problem for Plantronics. The reason consumers are willing to pay $200 for a headset is the range and the voice quality. Once these elements are comprimised, then what does Plantronics left with. This product would diminish the Plantronics' Brand image if they do not fix the range problem."
2,510s bluetooth headset,"very dissappointed with this product, not even 60 days goes by before its starts falling apart! I can't believe would put out a product like this."
2,Dissappointed with unit,This device offered confusing directions for installation. Had to call our IT Dept. to set up. Requires base to be a certain # of inches from phone. Has required a lot of tweaking to get it to work - and still playing with it to find optimal results. Can hear some static on the line during conversations.
5,best office bluetooth,"Easy to set up, so comfortable and functional - best desk based bluetooth I've yet to find!"
3,It's ok... compared to?,"I am a first time bluetooth user. The earpiece is somewhat uncomfortable although switching the different sized earbuds is helpful. It is very convenient to switch between office and mobile phone using the same unit. The callers though that I've talked to while using the unit all complain about it being very noisy, lots of static etc."
4,Does as advertised,"Good product that delivers as advertised. I use it for work, where I have frequent long (3-5 hours) teleconference calls per week and it has made those sessions much more pleasant. Colleagues on the other end say the voice quality is no different than when I used to speak into the handset, and the battery appears to have great staying power given I have used it for 7 hour calls thus far."
1,Not for cordless phones?,"If you work out of your home and have a cordless phone, this may not be for you. The headset adapter is meant to plug in directly the base of ""corded"" phone and replace the handset. Plantronics does maintain a list of compatible cordless phones on their site (mine isn't listed), so check their site first and talk to their support team to learn if this headset system will work for you."
1,Too complicated.,"This unit was almost impossible to operate and I was quite dissatisfied with it. The instructions were very ambiguous and not specific to this model. The first one I received did not function as it was supposed to, so I ordered another one, and it functioned the same as the first one. I finally gave up and returned it for a refund. Amazon made the return process simple for me."
5,OLE SCHOOL GREAT,"Willie D the gangster of love,callin all hoez on this one.His first solo joint,what a hell of an album.He says some stuff that makes ya say hmmmm,is he for real? Yes he is a true pioneer of Southern gangster rap.I would love to see the GETO BOYS do a full member reunion and do it like a G O.aLL PRAISE TO WILL,FACE and BILL."
3,"It'll Give You the ""Shivers""","William Schoell put out a number of King-esque horror novels back in the 80s. ""Shivers"" features a hideous creature stalking the underworld of a city which has the ability to kill merely by the virulence of its thoughts. Overall, it is a horror novel of average interest to those who love horror fiction."
4,Fun Music,"Fun light-hearted music with an late 80's early 90's bent. I enjoy this CD as its been a part of my collection for a long time. What it lacks in lyrical genius, it makes up for in good times and laughs."
5,a plus,"a plus, very good product,I recommended this vendor,i will looking for more in the futurethis product five starts"
5,Delicious Dill,These are Delicious....Everyone in my house loves them..my twin grandkids take them as there snack for school....We can't wait for them to get back in stock....I don't think they are too salty at all....They are just right to me....A+
3,Threads of Unbelievable Genius,"Without a doubt, this book contains true heart-wrenching genius. Many narrative and literary threads throughout Sophie's Choice are exquisitely deep and tormenting real. Styron's unique style, characterized by the most unbelievable descriptive starbursts, is truly a distinct and special gift - an amazing once-in-a-generation phenomenon.However, this genius is puzzling encased in hundreds of pages of trite, unnecessary and fairly banal narrative which is strangely and (given the book's subject matter) somewhat embarrassingly focused on carnality. The effect, for me, was that the book came across as gold threads woven into a depressingly common tapestry.Given that, I absolutely understand all the five star reviews and would absolutely second all of them. This book touched me in a way that no other book has; I would recommend it wholeheartedly."
5,A Perfect Reading Experience,"One of the most dozen or so perfect reading experiences you will have.Finished it in 5 days.Talk about unputdownable.Five stars for the exquisite language.Five stars for the explosively funny sex -- or lack of it. As brilliant as anything Roth has done.Five stars for the rendering of Auschwitz and the Nazi mind.Five stars for pacing and characterization.Five stars for the hilarious account of life at McGraw-Hill.(How on earth some readers find the opening ""weird"" is beyond me.)And five stars for making Sophie Catholic -- a brilliant choice that throws the Nazi's bestial mania into sharp relief: their evil knew no bounds.You wish they'd make this book compulsory reading in schools.(One school library in America tried to ban it.)But they won't. (Thanks to our sex-denying, death-denying culture.)Pass this book onto your children. God bless you William Styron.This is a perfect book."
2,Tragic & Original Story Ruined By Writer's Faults,"If Styron had just ejected his dull main character Stingo along with his perverse sexploitation of Sophie, this would be a brilliant novel about an unspeakable choice a young woman was forced to make while interned in a concentration camp & the devastating effects of that choice on the rest of her life."
1,Boring!,This book was so poorly written I couldn't finish it. How could he make such interestingly sad subject matter such a crashing bore? After trying many times to get past his gigantic and dull paragraphs I finally gave up and threw the book across the room in frustration.
5,"Powerful, poignant - a modern classic","The cover for the edition I read looks like a romance novel, and the first third of the book reads like one, albeit a tortured one.Then the core of the story is revealed, with Auschwitz and all its horrors taking center stage. I have read books with brief mentions of the camps, and of course seen Schindler's List, but this was by far was the clearest rendition of the evils performed there.A hard read at times, but a necessary one."
3,"This book is ""good"" at best","Sophie's Choice is a horrific account of Polish girl's life during WWII. Her life in the states is no picnic either. The book make you feel sorry for the girl one minute and makes you want to scream ""Wake up!"" in the next. Too much focus on her sexual exploits for really no apparent reason. The book drags before you can see what her choice was."
4,Sophie's Choice,"I loved the book and story line, however, there were places where the events were dragged out by insignificant happenings that could have been left out."
2,"Sorry, not my cup of tea.","Didn't care for either the style nor the subject matter. The author seemed to shift gears half way thru the book andwith all the fantasies, it just didn't seem to be realistic."
3,Attitudinal characters!,In an age when much popular fiction features stock characters and scenarios the unique characters in Styron's novel provided a refreshing change. From Nathan's attitudinal outbreaks to Sophie's deliberate lies the characters present many sides that makes an otherwise mediocre novel more interesting.
2,Audio book is abridged; I recommend buying unabridged version of the book.,"I bought the audio CD of this book. Having listened to a number of audio books over the years, I was a little surprised that this one was only three hours long. I realized fairly quickly that it was an abridged audiobook (which, at the time, was not made clear in the product description when I bought it. It's now much clearer.) The book isn't bad, and it was decent to pass three hours of time, but I definitely do not recommend the audiobook. I imagine that the unabridged book is probably very good, but too much was omitted from the audiobook to fully appreciate this book."
4,A look at the Holocaust from an unfamiliar point of view,"One of the best looks at how the Nazi Holocaust destroyed the lives of 11 million people, almost half of whom were not Jewish. The choice(s) that Sophie makes will shock the uninitiated in Holocaust literature, though you would be well advised to keep in mind that such choices were made on a daily basis by those who survived the madness of World War II. A haunting, disturbing work that will stay with the reader for a lifetime."
5,Almost a Holocaust Masterpiece,"William Sytron did an excellent job bring Sophie's story to life. The occuring events mirror those that really occurred. Sophie was not the only person had to make the choices that she made. I have been studying the Holocaust very deeply for the past few months, and this is the best novel I have read so far. I never expected that William Styron would be able to make me almost feel the inhumanity to man that Sophie and her non-Aryans felt. The cruelty that she suffered is unimaginable. No person should have to experience what she experienced ever again. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Holocaust, or to anyone who just wants to read a great, thrilling, and grabbing book!"
2,"Partly brilliant, completely overrated","There is so much useless verbeage in this book that it is almost unreadable. Stingo is really a boring narrator when it comes down to it and his struggles to get laid do hardly a fine piece of literature make. And using the f-word is not really all that outrageous, is it now. Parts are undeniably brilliant, but the whole is a waste of time. (All this comes from someone who has a soft spot for that excessively wordy southerner, Thomas Wolfe.)"
3,"Excellent writing, but totally depressing","I am an avid reader, and expected this book to be magnificent. While Styron's writing is top notch, there was nobody in the book who was normal! I gave up after 250 pages of weirdness. I most certainly could not identify with any of the characters, and the story line, which was depressing from the start, only promised to get worse. I read not only for entertainment, but also to improve my mind. It was only Styron's beautiful turn of phrase that kept me reading so long. Too bad the entire story centered around such despondency. There's plenty of nonfiction history about the concentration camps. A novel such as this does not, in my view, provide a compelling enough reason to endure the doom and gloom of wading through the miserable tale."
5,believe the hype,"Sorry to sound like the jacket cover or something, but this truly is one of the great novels of the 20th century. This story is as dark as they come, and brilliantly written--Styron has a mastery of the English language rivaling any other great American author. The last chapter should be studied in all writing classes. Seriously, this book is amazing. I didn't even want to like it (I admit, because of all of the critical acclaim), but now it has forced its way onto my favorite's list. You win this round, Styron ..."
2,Kindle edition full of errors!,"I'm sure this is a great book, but the Kindle edition is almost unreadable! It appears to have been created by scanning a hardcopy, and then published without even so much as spell checking it! There are so many instances of things like lower case 'l' appearing as number '1' that it is hard to get through the book!"
3,Not really all that good,"I understand why people found this story to be so moving but ultimately it did not work for me. I found the narrative to be unnecessarily fragmented, and the flashes of absolutely brilliant writing that mark Stingo's early New York experience are virtually gone midway through. Instead of allowing the story to tell itself, Styron employs this rather omnipresent non-fiction-like voice to the passages regarding Sophie's Auschwitz experiences that is flat to the point of anesthesia. It is a mystery to me why he didn't allow the reader to learn more through probing and tense dialogue than term-paperish prose. And the characters relationships to one another are, behind the masks of blood-rushing passion, rather cliche and somewhat antiseptic."
4,whirley pop real theatre popcorn,"The popcorrn is delicious, perfect amount of oil and seasoning. However, the freight makes it a little pricey. Wish they would get it in more retail outlets."
1,Not what I wanted,"The Whirley pop 5 pack popping Kit order was misleading.I didnt think it was only five packs and not five boxes. I will never buy this again.Too expensive.and also I think the corn kernels were too dry, maybe they were too old."
2,Backorders,I received one out of my order and havn't received the rest yet. Its been too long of a wait
3,Cracked Case,"The item arrived on 3/9/11 (on time), but the case was cracked. Since it was packaged in protective wrap, I don't understand why the case was cracked. It was more efficient for me to replace the case than to return the product, since I wanted to listen to the opera before seeing it.The quality of the recording was acceptable, though I prefer other Rossini operas to this one."
5,If you only knew,Please let me help you to want to read this book.You read it and make up your own mind.Within the pages of this wonderfully written book you will find that Mr. Herbert W. Armstrong has simply as possibly able made a summary of the most complex book in existence-The Bible.He has successfully explained the main themes of The Bible so a child can understand.You read it.You decide.
1,"This is an altered copy, not the original!","Mystery of the Ages, as originally written by Herbert W. Armstrong is a wonderful book, filled with truth, and I highly recommend reading the original hard cover from 1985. This one is an altered copy that the Philadelphia Church of God puts out. They have made some changes to the original after purchasing the rights to some of Herbert Armstrong's works. The removal of the paragraph about there not being any prophets in the NT times was removed by Gerald Flurry because he wanted to try and prove that he is ""That Prophet"" mentioned in Bible scriptures, who is actually Jesus Christ! Stay away from this altered copy and try to find an original hard covered edition from 1985. I once purchased an original on amazon.com for one cent. There are often copies of the original, un altered version available."
5,Mystery of the Ages,"If you like traditional books that have been around for a while, I would def suggest this book. It is most enlightening and I know that Herbert W. Armstrong has earned respect as an author, as an educator and theologian from many people around the world. If you are interested in broading your horizon with an open mind and truly believe in faith, I HIGHLY recommend this book to you!"
1,"A summary work of a dangerous, deceiving cult","I became caught in the web of the Worldwide Church of God in the early 80s. Praise God I was delivered. This particular book is a summary of Herbert Armstrong's theology. Highly legalistic, it effectively guts the gosepl, denies the Trinity, and culminates in the declaration that all believers will ultimately become gods themselves. Read the real book, the Bible itself, and know the truth for yourself."
1,This Is Just Wrong!,"I had to quit reading half-way through. The man uses many Biblical references, but most out of context and with his own personal interpretations. He claims the Bible does not teach of the Holy Trinity, yet--though the actual word ""trinity"" is not used in the Bible (to my knowledge)--there are many references to God being three-in-one and a mystery to us all. The author claims to answer all the questions of the universe, but seems to go round-and-round in circles and never get to the point. If you need something good to smirk at, read this Mystery of the Ages. But if you want real answers, stick to the Bible!"
5,battlefield park guide,this is a must have for anyone interested in the civil war especially if you are planning to visit the parks.
4,worth reading,"I really enjoyed this novel. The author sets up a story of political intigue while remaining true to the bible. I liked the idea of the three prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel interacting. Most of all I liked seeing Daniel as youth. It gives the reader a way to relate to the biblical characters."
4,Adding a dimension to a too-overlooked story,"David Lantz clearly knows how to associate a reader with characters that are often underappreciated by readers of the bible. The prophet Jeremiah, Shadrack, Meshack, Abendigo, Daniel, and many more characters are taken to the lifelike dimension in this story that helped me personally understand where this bible story tied in with the ancient world history that we all took in school. Buy this book, and I promise you that it will not be money wasted.This novel has many striking similarities to Tom Clancy books, in the fact that it follows many separate stories that are tied together in connections that cannot be broken.Clearly, David Lantz was being guided by the Lord when he wrote this. I hope that this review will help to place this book in everyone's hands, even maybe help those who don't have the Lord in their lives to come to know him better."
5,Hey O,"I thought this was an awesome book. The book starts out giving you only hints to both sides of an intriguing plot. Then you actually find out both sides of the story and find out who is good and bad. This book takes you to some great places like Egypt, Kush, and even some Greek warriors play a big role. it is an excellent book and I can not wait for a sequal."
5,Thoroughly Beautiful,"Roy has an incredible ability to suffuse each page of ""Long Journey From Wikame"" with breathtaking artistry and beautiful prose. He masterfully weaves these two abilities to tell the amazing story of the Walapai and the Journey to Wikame."
1,A very boring 1st Doctor Adventure!!No aliens!!Avoid!! Dull!,"This adventure is a very boring adventure with the 1st Doctor,Steven and Dodo. The novel is adventure dealing with human history. There are no aliens etc! This novel put me to sleep which is a rare thing for a Doctor Who novel to do!! Avoid it or check it out at local library before you buy it!!"
5,Tablet Protection,"The bag does the job, simple as that.As a landscaping contractor, I need to be able to carry my gear around in all kinds of weather, and I need it to stay whole and functioning.The bag fits snugly over the tablet, and keeps it from getting damaged. I had no difficulty getting the tablet in or out of the bag, and no trouble with storing cord or pen.I carry the tablet and the laptop in an open organizer, so the bag is needed to protect from the elements as well as friction and impact damage. It has worked well, and allowed me to carry the tablet back and forth to the truck, to be kept on hand ~ a critical need, as most of the times I've used the tablet I've been in the truck.If I needed another tablet for another employee, I wouldn't think of issuing it without the accompanying bag."
3,If It Has To Go Portable,"If you are taking your work to and from the office, it's great. For minimal protection though. Wish it had harder sides.If you're just going to store the tablet when not in use...just keep the box it comes in."
2,Find another one!!!,"I recently bought this travel bag by Wacom. I though to myself, I mean if Wacom makes it well it perfect for my new tablet. Not so!!! As the other review has said here its really really a tight fit. Seems smaller. Don't know about you but what were they thinking when they made it soo tight. Also as one of the other reviewers mentioned ""I hope the zippper doesn't break."" Well it did with me when i tried to squeeze my Brand New tablet in there. I'm just glad Wacom does a good job on tablets but they need to stay out of the Travel Bag business. Trust me find another bag for it. Google it or something. This bag is too pricey for the quality. I really wanted it to be a great product, but alas you can't have everything."
4,Nice....but....,"Nice bag. REALLY wish it had a pocket for the cords, etc. The fit is tight, which is good. I would give it five stars if not for a lack of pocket. Wacom...are you listening?"
5,What's not to like?,"If you're a diehard Dan fan like me, then you'll love this collection featuring some of his best-known songs. Sure, you may have some of these songs on other albums, but it's great to be able to mix things up."
3,Buzz and echo,One thing that is less than obvious is that there is a dial on the side that you should use to match the device to your phone. On the other side there is an a/b type of switch. This means 8 combinations and no guidance. So it's trial and error and calling someone to see how it sounds to them.I spent an hour trying to find a combination that worked and never could find one that didn't produce a very loud annoying hum and echo.
2,Works good when it works.,"I have had this product for over a year now. Here are some difficulties I have experienced.1) At times I am talking on the hand held reciever on my phone and without warning, the person doesn't appear to be there any longer. My earpiece has picked up without my noticing.2) In the middle of a meeting using the bluetooth earpiece, it hangs up.3) If I haven't used it in awhile I can't get it to work. The red light on the base starts blinking, the blue lisht which is normally on the base unit goes off and you can't get it to come back on, and the yellow light on the base unit is on. The earpiece has a red light flashing. When I get in this state, I might as well forget it. Sometimes in a few days it just starts working again. Usually I know it is working again, because #1 problem happens again."
1,Bad product,Not only was it impossible to use ... and not what I needed ... then the company charged me a 20% restocking fee ... talk about salt in the wound ... I will never use this com[pany ever again ... P.S. I still have not received my return amkount charged back to my7 credit card ... very bad experience
3,Casio,"Work fine. Easy to load. However, the ribbons are small so you cannot print large quantities of work. But that may be an issue with the printer design itself. Overall, good product."
4,Repeat order of printing supplies,I am a repeat orderer of this item from J&R and have never been disappointed. Quick email re delivery info and just as quick delivery. Pleased as always.
3,"Good Product, Poor customer service/shipping.","I guess my turn is up....meaning I have fallen in the not so happy category this time. 5 calls (3 unanswered) and 3 weeks later I received the item. The item is great, Casio makes a good product. I was looking for best price and forgot about what all comes with (sometimes) best prices. Wishing you a better experience with this vendor, if you choose to buy here. As for myself, I will pay a little more, elsewhere, next time."
3,An Interesting Novel But Not Without Its Faults,"""Pagan's Father,"" the story of a gay man's struggle to keep the little girl he has grown to love, is an enjoyable novel. However it was somewhat hampered by several problems I had in reading the story. The novel is written in the present tense, in the form of a letter to Pagan's dead mother, Candida. This grew to be confusing because of the repeated switches in the time period. Many time I was confused about what was going on. Also, I think the book at 400 plus pages was too long. It could have easily been cut down 100 pages or so without losing any of the story. Despite its short-comings, I enjoyed the novel a great deal and thought it had a very good plot and it was compelling enough for me to read in two sittings"
3,Lilith a Familiar Spirit ??? !!!!,"Ummm. I was assuming the book would be about the elemental spirits of Earth (Gnomes),Water (Undines), Fire (Salamanders) and Air (Sylphs) to be at the beck and call of a Witch, Sorcerer, Pagan etc but Lilith !? Maybe I should read his 'Sexual Alchemy' or 'Liber Lilith' but both are out of print. This is an interesting book but when Tyson equates Lovecraft's Shub Niggurath in 'Grimoire of Necronomicon'with Lilith, I'll take a pass."
3,"Some Good Ideas, but...","I purchased this book based on the previous reviews. I admit now that it is NOT a good way to decide to purchase a magic book. The book presents too many assertions that the reader should take at face value. He does not encourage the reader to see if his assertions are true for themselves. I very much liked the idea of power glyphs as they are easy to combine into sigils to create one's own familiars. However, that is about as useful as I found the book. I found the writing to be disjointed and it failed to keep my interest. This book could do with less dogmatism and better editing."
4,very good introduction,"This little book covers the essential points of the history of spatterware produced in England for the early American market, from late 18th century to about 1840, as well as American examples. Multiple illustrations on almost every page in black and white. Maker's marks, useful notes on factories, producers, dating clues, bibliography for further research. Also interesting from the point of view of international trade and the development of industry."
2,"25 pages of text, huh?","Yes, I agree a book can not be judged by the number of pages it has. I mean look at UML Distilled. But, I had certain expectations for the content and that is where the focus should be. If you remove the screen shots and code sample you are left with a book of maybe 25 pages.I purchased Katonka's book thinking I would use it as a guide, but there too many gaps of knowledge and disconnected ideas. I simply couldn't follow the project design and there was very little explanation of what and why. I think Ovanesyan's Visual Basic SAP R/3 Programming is far superior. I had to do some serious searching to find it, but it was worth it."
2,Waste of many,"This book as ONLY 150 pages with BIG letter, almost no images and have no CD-ROM/DVD to suport the code in it. It's a contents is composed by 80% code (which could by the way be on a CD-ROM) and 20% techiqal referes.Make yourselves a favour, give your money to charity institution insted.I Rate the value of this book 20 dolars with a free shiping.AAL!"
3,not for men,my female friend loves this scent..however way too feminine and sweet smelling for a man to wear..U can smell a hint of gin and tonic but the flowery scents overpower this.
4,A good book about Fibonacci trading,"This is a solid 4-star book. I thought that I would learn something new about trading Fib levels, unfortunately no - most of the techniques are discused on the forums or are writted by Dinapoli or Fischer. But anyway, all the information is relevant and can be applied to real life trading, and the author adds some more trading tips and strategies."
3,Tough reading,"Written by a trader, not an author. Takes patience and fortitude by going over and over the first few chapters on the basics to understand fibos. It can be done but you must REALLY want it! It's all there but simply not well written for beginners."
2,"Nothing fantastic, an okay introduction for beginners","After reading some of the other reviews I thought the book would be a lot better than it was. While it does give a good introduction to Fibonacci and some of its uses, I found the book a bit hard to put into practice into my own trading. There are a lot of examples of specific trades and what went right and what went wrong. Maybe it needs another read to absorb all the information. But my impression after finishing the book was that using this approach to trade doesn't really improve your chances in isolation but must be used with other indicators to even be useful. So while the book doesn't make any promises, if you are dedicated, disciplined and willing to learn this way of trading, then maybe it might suit your style of personality and trading. While its all very interesting I didn't feel it suited my trading style."
5,"Beautiful,just beautiful","I love this piece, it reminds me of myself and my best friend. I can imagine the secrets they are sharing. Thank you for capturing these wonderful moments."
5,Beautiful,"Like all Williow Tree pieces, this is also amazing. I bought this to give as a gift to my best friend of 26 years."
3,"Stunningly bad conducting, great tenor","I bought this CD for no other reason than Ben Heppner's incomparable singing of the tenor songs, equalled on CD only by Fritz Wunderlich, who was helped a lot by the engineers. Waltraud Meier has a curdled voice that doesn't appeal to me, and I knew Maazel was a slack, often perverse Mahler conductor. Alas, he outdoes himsefl here with tempi and phrasisng that make no sense and frequently interrupt the line.Heppner's three songs come off best because they are shorter than the mezzo's and so Maazel does less damage. But he does enough. For anyone who is a total Heppner fan, I can say that he sings beautifully, with more freedom than his voice currently possesses. If that's enough, buy this CD."
2,This is for a larger Barbie Doll!,"By no fault of the site or vendor, I puchased this for my granddaughter's Barbie Doll. It is for a larger Barbie....will be way too big for the regular Barbie Doll."
2,Don't waste your money..........,Don't waste your money unless you can tie knots by reading descriptions of how to tie them. This book was one of the biggest disappointments I've ever seen in the entire literary world.
1,A Waste of Money.,"Save your money and buy flash cards. My grandson's comment was that this DVD was made for 5 year olds. The only multiplication tables were the ones and the elevens. The characters were actors in over sized head costumes. I would have preferred animations or no costumes at all. The songs had neither rhyme nor interest, but were merely repetition of facts. Supposedly there is a storyline about electricity going off, but it made no sense."
3,Hagiography--well deserved,"The writing is archaic--this biography was produced not too long after its subject's death. It's obvious, too, that the author worshiped Mr. Garrison. I guess if you're going to pick an American hero to worship, you could do worse. William Lloyd Garrison is one of the true moral giants not just of American History, but world history as well. You really should read the truly excellent biography of Garrison from the 20th Century: All On Fire: William Lloyd Garrison & the Abolution of Slavery."
2,"Great product, but came dirty!","Steering wheel came on time, and fit the wheel great, but it was supposed to be in new condition, and it came dirty! The white NOS symbols where grayish pink! Please, if you're going to sell us a USED steering wheel, please say so in the product description!"
3,does not fit well,"Match well with the floor vinyl carpet and make of Nice material and all, but it is very loose after putting it on. Not tight at all. steering wheel is not very controllable when turning. gotta grip it hard"
3,Great price doesn't fit steering wheel that well,I bought this to match my car interior I jumped at the price but not too happy about the fit. Could be more snug it doesn't slid around or anything like that...could be better. But it will do for now.
3,Very Interesting,This book is one of many that I have to read for a class titled 1980's America. I think that the author makes some great arguments and points out a few diffrent connections between MTV and American society. It is very easy to lose interest in the first few chapters but keep going and it will become easier to follow. He goes into depth with various songs and breaks down the actual videos. Definitly an intersting view on the importance of MTV in the 80's. But it is also nice to have some background knowledge on the time period.
4,Anti-Authoritarian Cultural Analysis,"Jeff Riggenbach's In Praise of Decadence is a wonderful book.Written in a style that combines Ayn Rand's clarity with Gore Vidal's turns-of-phrase and H. L. Mencken's acerbic wit, In Prasie of Decadence is both a compact introduction to libertarianism and anti-authoritarian cultural analysis. I can't think of any other libertarian book that could be better marketed to Gen-X and Millennial students."
5,"Captivating, clean, and all-around incredible!","Oh yeah, this is probably the BEST book in the SpringSong series!! Don't miss it! Leslie and Steven . . . the ""unlikely couple"" plot is familiar of course, but that's the ONLY ""familiar"" feature of this entire book. The whole thing twists and turns and spins and spirals in ways you're never quite expecting (even when you think you are). A fresh plot, a fresh group of characters (no stereo-types to be found), a fresh moral lesson, and just an awesome plot! You've never read a book quite like it, and you'll love it--I read it in two days!"
4,Leslie,This book has great morals and story line. I loved that it provided my teenage daughter with enjoyment without crude language
5,WHOA...GANKSTA NIP IS TRULY DEMENTED!,"I love this album. The South Park Psycho is on of my favorite rap albums of all time. It ranks right up there with The Geto Boys self-titled album and Too Much Trouble's ""Bringing Hell On Earth"" album. Only someone like NIP could come up with songs about raping his grandmother and dead goats and have it be a hit album. I play this little piece of Ganksta Gold whenever I get a chance. ""Slaughter"" is the best cop killer song to date! Don't believe me? Buy this album and see for yourself!"
3,Lies. The battery has enough charge to crash at least 6 times.,"Don't have too high expectations. You won't have too much control, but that also means you won't get into as much trouble. If you have it properly balanced as described in the manual, it should fly just fine.My batteries won't charge so I bought another set. However, i got the wrong size, 6 cell, AA sized, instead of AAA sized. So it's a little overweight. Luckily, this thing's got enough surplus power that it actually still flew while overweight, and with a battery pack strapped tot he outside of the fuselage instead of tucked into the fuselage."
5,Very nice job!,"Rickover has succeeded where others have failed in making the essential ideas of the Alexander Technique available in clear, everyday language.I seriously injured myself at the height of the aerobics craze and after years of trying everything from chiropractic to surgery (all of which cost big, big $ and did no good) I finally found an Alexander teacher who, in just a few lessons, helped me to be almost completely pain free. Best of all, she showed me how I could look after myself and not be dependant on therapists or doctors.If you're concerned about your body's fitness, buy this book!"
5,The best Alexander Technique book available.,"This is the one book about the Alexander Technique that made sense to me and convinced me to have lessons. I had back and neck problems that my doctor was unable to help me with, except with painkillers that just covered up the problem. I had read a couple of other books about the Technique, but they just didn't make sense to me. Rickover's book is written in a no-nonsense style that showed me that the Technique is really a very practical process that I could learn to use for my own benefit. I'm happy to say I'm now almost completely pain-free and never have to resort to pain killers anymore!"
5,Great!,I got this floor mat 4 weeks ago and it's everything I expected. It fits perfectly in my 2008 Scion tC and looks great. Just have to wash the white stripe every once in a while(so it looks clean) but that's to be expected. I'll have to see if it lasts for the long run but so far it's awesome!
4,look nice,"nice price, nice looking and easy to clean just use a little soappy water. fast shipping and packaged well. They fit my car fine with just a little trimming required on the drivers side (easy to trim with sharp sissors)."
5,excellent product,"I thought that because it was so cheap the build quality would be just okay at best. As soon as I opened the package and took out the brand new mats I could immediately tell that these were made really good and they look so much better than the mats that came in my car. Overall, these racing mats exceeded my expectations. Ordering more R racing products as I type this"
5,Great set that matches with the utility mats and steering wheel cover,"I bought this product for my brand new 2010 Honda Insight with the clear sky blue metallic color. The colors of these mats goes perfectly with the exterior/ interior colors of my car.Pro: Very stylish, goes great with the Blue R Racing Velocity Style Molded Utility Mat 14"" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002MBC3K/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title and the Blue R Racing Velocity Style Steering Wheel Cover http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002NILZQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleCons: A little on the more expensive side to outfit your car. Cost me around $60 for the front mats, the utility mat (have to buy 2 of these), and the steering wheel cover.Bottom line: If you love the color blue like me and want to add some razzle dazzle to your car buy these mats along with the matching utility mats and steering wheel cover and you will be very happy with your purchase."
1,the pitfalls of sonic adventure 2 fill an entire game,"all the bad reviews are right, the controls are confusing and the game becomes frustrating because you keep falling off cliffs without knowing why. then you have to go back to the last checkpoint and do the same thing again and again just hoping for the best and not really playing anymore."
4,"Fun, But Difficult.","Sonic Heroes is a pretty good game. The levels are super long, and some of the bosses will get you pissed out of your mind. But after it's all done, the feeling of satisfaction is indescribable. It's really good to finally be playing as Knuckles and not have to go hunting. The Chaotix are super cool too. And for the record, HIS NAME IS ROBOTNIK!!!!!!!!!! What's with calling him Eggman?!!Anyway, BUY THIS GAME!!! You'll be glad you did."
2,Nice play but lots cons,"This was a great game to play its just... you'd think they'd get the same vioce actors for tails and kunckles. Tails always sounds more childish, and kunckles always sounds.... wierd. the best vioceovers for any of these characters has to be the First Sonic Adventure. Which is, sadly, only for gamecube and dreamcast. This Game doesn't have the same quality of story line as the previous sonic adventures did. while the team thing was great, it was not great that Knuckles ability to climb walls was taken away. All we can do is hope seag realizes its mistakes. i hope the next sonic game is more like the first sonic adventure."
4,only if you're in to it,"overall the game is ok.the only thing that brings it down is the difficulty.when you get to level 4, it gets so hard that it gets boring"
4,Sonic Heroes for the Xbox,"This is the first Sonic 3-d game I've played because it is the first one out on xbox. It's one of the best game I've ever played, but it has some things wrong with it. Such as they always say the same stuff over again like Knuckles:Shift Rock Shift Rock!!! But overall I recomend buying this game."
1,annoying game,"This game is VERY annoying, and can get tiring easily. The thing I don't like about it is that it only lets you play game stages, and you get bored easily. The annoying thing about it is that when you move in a special way, like flying, the person that is moving will make a very annoying sound. I wouldn't buy it."
4,"OK, HOW THE **** CAN YOU WRITE A REVIEW YET? THE GAME ISN'T","cont. from above: RELEASED!!!OK, U PEEPS R BEING STUPID, WAIT FOR IT TO BE RELEASED, PLAY IT (FOR MORE THAN 5 MINUTES) AND THEN WRITE THE REVIEW, I BUY STUFF BASED ON THE RATING (THE STARS) AND UR MESSIN IT UP! AND, ALOT OF PEOPLE ARENT EVEN CHOOSING THE AMOUNT OF STARS, SO PLZ REMEMBER, AND OH YA, IF U PLAY DIABLO II (LOD) WISPER Mr_Jiggyfly-DB IF U HAVE ANY PROBLEMS!"
4,great game,"hey bj why don't YOU go and try the game, for yourself, instead of bad-mouthin' other people. g's enough with the DRAMA! The sonic game is a great game, and BJ, y don't u go and try it!"
5,Trust me,Trust me this is the best game ever. People are saying that this game sucks but it DOESNT its great its fun. although some levels can be hard it will pay off at the end
4,another excuse to remove another one game of sonic,"This game is boring,When I went to play the cousin house who has a gamecube and bonus disc of mari kart double dash and play and is super boring"
5,You aint seen nothin' yet,"I agree with the above review in that Citizen Cope's quiet, personal hip-hop/folk stuff like the song ""Salvation"" are incredible. I've known this artist as a local phenomenon in DC for several years and I promise you he has plenty of songs like that -- that bring a club to a hush when he plays live. His big label affiliation has brought a level of sophistication that I'm confident can bring out the depth and range in his music -- if he can hold the big-label money machine in check enough to focus on his incredibly personal grooves. Like RadioHead, Beck and many others, Clarence Greenwood's challange now is to stay true to the incredible depth of his art and performance. He deserves to be a household name."
5,none,I have all three of his albums and LOVE them. It's been on my playlist constantly for the last couple of weeks.
3,dynamite,"This cb is smooth. That is the first word that comes to mind. reminds me of the rat pack, cool, mellow, with kind of a sinister undertone. Good production Values."
4,citizen cope's 1st album,not as good as the clarence greenwood recordings but good to see his evolution as an artist. and still amazing cope as usual.
3,good,"I saw this guy as an opening act for Ben Folds and I was impressed. At the show they only had a five song cd all the songs are on this album.The song ""Salvation"" is amazing and ""contact"" is good as well. The other three were okay. This guy has real potential and I will buy his full album. I just wish he would stick with songs more like ""Salvation""."
4,"Great soft, safe, imaginative toy!","My grandson really enjoys this item we recently purchased. Unlike other castle type toys, this is soft, safe, and well constructed. Excellent for travel and the manufacturer replace missing parts free at any time."
3,No instructions and no box,"I ordered this toy to send to a three year old as a gift. I was very disappointed when the toy arrived without a box, depicting how the castle would appear and without instructions. Instead, it arrived in a sealed plastic bag. Although I was impressed with the description of the item that I had read at this site, I am concerned that the child who receives this toy from me will not understand what it is, or what it can be. I am also concerned that the parents will be similarly confused. Presentation may not be everything, but it is alot. This toy lacks such presentation -- I am more inclined to buy the Fisher Price castle."
2,poor man's Elmore Leonard,"Pelecanos wants to be Elmore Leonard really bad but he ends being a Leonard lite at best. The book is really detailed screen play and not very good one either. Here is a sample of some of the annoying clichés:1. The good guys coach football to rescued or troubled kids, and their team of poor kids, in spite of their ragged uniforms etc., beats the obnoxious rich kids team.2. Of course, Pellecanos can't have the hero PI Strange be all good because that wouldn't be too old fashioned, so he has him visiting massage parlors.3. He loves his secretory (she knows about the massage parlor secret and still loves him!) and in the end proposed to her because 'he loves her and needs her' and also because 'her son needs a father figure'.This was first Pellecanos novel and it is going to be also the last.Do yourself a favor read or reread any Elmore Leonard. You will be much more satisfied."
1,Trying Too Hard,"I made it exactly eight pages in to this novel. The writer seemed to be unfamiliar with the subjects he was attempting to portray. The dialogue was forced and uneven. It seemed to be cobbled together from bits and pieces of misrepresentations heard on ""MTV"" or ""Comic View."" For me that ruined the entire book before the story had a chance to begin.The author was trying too hard to convey subject matter he knew nothing about or completely misunderstood. It was too nerve grating for me too continue."
1,Hell to Read,"I'm not a big fan of crime fiction, but I had read some good reviews on this story in some Men's magazine and figured I'd pick it up. Thankfully I had the sense to borrow it form the library instead of purchasing it.""Hell to Pay"" was insanely boring. This would be the perfect novel to turn into a Steven Segall movie because it is already lacking a plot. Pelecanos jumps around way too much, and at too many times when he should be fleshing out the story more or adding some more action, which ""Hell"" is seriously devoid of. It seems like he used this book as a chance to describe the seedier side of Washington and to mention all of the urban hip-hop artists he knows rather than trying to tell an entertaining story."
2,Gritty and depressing,"You can certainly smell and feel life on the inner-city streets of Washington D.C in this story.But maybe that is the problem, the violence and lives of the people described is just too depressing to make compelling reading.The plot lost direction at times and wandered off on tangents, without contibuting anything to the story.If you like urban, gritty, realistic to a fault, novels about life on the mean streeets - then this is for you. But if don't, then give it a miss."
1,Maybe later,"Snapped this up from bargain books, after reading all the good reviews. I found it boring and trite from the start and then it got worse. After 70 pages I gave up on it. Maybe later."
1,"One thing Pelecanos is not, is a 'brother'.","The tortured language, the dialogue, is simply awful. His attempt to make the detective's conversations seem like Spencer is more like Shaft in drag and it fails miserably.The sexual tension is gratuitous, seems forced as if added to make the book sell rather than spending the pages in deeper character building. It's rare that I won't finish even a bad look, but this one I finally threw at the wall at page 160. Enough."
1,disappointed,"What a wonderful voice Richard Haymes had. It's a shame so few of the arrangements here do that voice justice. Nothing swings, heck they barely creep forward. No jazz, just endless arrays of violins, harps, pianos and I thought I heard an accordion on one track. It's like expecting Sinatra and Riddle and getting Lawrence Welk. Great voice though, and some of the numbers with the Andrew Sisters are swell, but that's about it."
5,Outstanding book by an outstanding man,"Dee Molenaar eschews the glib, self-serving, and obnoxious style so prevalent in this genre. Instead, Molenaar presents a chronicle of human history on ""The Mountain"" that is well written, informative, and self-effacing. He barely touches his own remarkably impressive mountaineering achievements and I am hopeful he publishes his memoirs soon. Further, it is a pleasure to read a writing style reflecting a generation which held manners and chivalry with esteem. Indeed, there is an element of anachronism in this revised edition, and it is worth preserving. I am honored that my copy is signed by the author!"
3,A good primer on Rainier,"A good history of the ascents of Rainier, via different routes; Molenaar is a prior guide and climbing ranger at Rainier and is one of the true legends of the area. The book is getting a little dated now. If you want a more updated route guide w/descriptions, I would strongly recommend Mike Gauthier's book - Mt. Rainier: A Climbing Guide. Gauthier is a current climbing ranger at Rainier."
3,"Dated, but good","3 stars because I NEED maps!! The author/artist relies on sketches to show the mountain, glaciers, and various routes. Very few maps are used to orient the reader to the mountain's location, trails, camps and routes used, etc. I needed to keep my laptop close by to help figure out where things were happening. This book was written in the 70's with an update in the 90's, which perhaps could have included more detailed mapping. An earlier reviewer mentioned the book's age showed but was still worth the read, and I agree. It was obvious the author loved the Mountain and passes it along to the reader."
5,This work is NO joke!,This book is NO Joke. It is heavy by weight and heavy with Biblical/Ancient History. The Included CD is worth the price for the book and ir alone. BUY THIS WORK!
3,Annals of the World/paperback,"I just received this item in the mail. Although I am exceedingly impressed with the ""Annals of the World"" (which, for content, I would give a 5 rating), I was extremely disappointed that the paperback version did NOT include the CD which is included in the hardback edition. To me, that CD is more valuable than the book. So, the paperback version is not worth buying--when you can get the hardback for only about $20. more.If you are not a computer user, you might be okay with the paperback. Still, I'm sure you could find someone who would pay you $20 for the CD if you couldn't use it, and you could still come out ahead by buying the hardback version."
2,Date of creation VERY inaccurate,"Date of creation is LAUGHABLE!! 4004-BC ??If one takes names of people and ages from the Bible,the age of creation appears to be about 12,000 years..However, we know that to be an error, also!Man has walked the earth about 150 to 200 thousandyears ago........"
5,Beautiful pictures!,I purchased this book for the baby of a close friend and recently for my own grandson for his Baptism. It is beautifully illustrated and it brought my daughter to tears with its description of the special day. I would highly reccomend this book.
5,Excellent Macro Lens,"This lens works perfectly with my Kodak Z612 - I didn't notice any problems with the auto focus or flash...I used it with both and the pictures were great, the clarity was amazing and I am so happy I can finally get super close, very clear macro images. You do have to experiment with it a little to get use to it, and you do have to zoom past the tunnel that the adapter ring creates, but this lens is worth every penny."
2,Mediocre,"I liked the organization of this book, and I really liked the way they organized the hikes in the appendix, listing them by difficulty, time to hike, with children etc.That said, the actual descriptions were ok, and the maps and illustrations were very poor.I would not recommend this book at all. There are better books on this topic for a few bucks more."
4,Surviving the Nazi seige in Leningrad,"I've always read as much as I could find concerning the holocoust, and this was a good find for me, focusing on the same Nazi WWII power takeover, but in a different locale. The setting is Leningrad Russia. The story concerns a family and the hardships they and the other citizens encounter in their daily struggles to survive, even managing to find love along the way."
1,Worst book I read/taught in a long time. Waste of time.,"This book has got to be one of the worst books that I have read in my entire life and I am ashamed to have to teach it for the IGCSE. The problem of the organic intellectual in this book seems to have been completely ignored by most reviewers. The author has absolutely nothing to do with Leningrad, and thus, the entire account is based on speculation. Consequently, the novel sounds more like British propaganda than anything remotely authentic.Furthermore, the novel reads terribly, with adjectives inserted gratuitously for no apparent reason other that to mystify the reader and create awkward sentences. As a result, reading this novel is a painful experience, which my students will unfortunately have to share with me.I would like to add, that my girlfriend and my brother, all three of us Literature B.A.s from different universities, also found this novel to be a terrible read. Not only is it a waste of money but a waste of time."
4,A stunning novel,"This is a fine work of historical fiction. The characterizations are alive; these could be living people, and their story is a heartbreaking one. The only complaint I have with the novel is the fact that it jumps from late December 1941, directly to May 1942 -- Uh, how did Anna, Andrei and Kolya survive during the other three & one-half months of winter? It was too abrupt a break in the flow of the work. Also, I personally thought the weakest part of the book was all that concerned Anna's romance with Andrei. I didn't feel the chemistry of the romance; I actually wanted more and more about how the family survived during the siege.Still, everything else about the book is SO powerful, (the characters of Anna's dead mother; her father and Maria Petrovna his mistress, in particular) I gladly give it four stars and recommend it highly."
3,Absorbing but falls short,"This book is deeply absorbing. I devoured it, and learned a great deal from it about the effects of starvation and cold combined, and about what Leningrad must have looked, felt and smelled like during the siege. I learned somewhat less about the historico-political facts, which is a shame as gradually I realized this was a good historical novel, diligent in rendering and translating into fine prose all its author had absorbed from other books, but not a great work of literature. The characters never came alive for me; I never learned what I wanted to about who they were as people, and although I was rooting for the strong and lovely Anna all along, I did not feel her psyche was illuminated in meaningful ways. Although the distinction between ""fiction"" and ""literature"" is sometimes spurious, I would call this decidedly fiction."
2,Not Well Recorded,"I strongly agree with the negative aspects of this album as pointed out the 3 star reviewer if you have the patience to read his entire review, and can find no redeeming qualities. 5 tracks with Art Farmer as a quintet needs to have better sound quality. They sold Contemporary Records LP reissues in The Colony record store in Times Square around 1970 but I don't remember seeing this one.MODERN ART with Benny Golson and Bill Evans at least has the better sound quality."
5,Nice,"I recieved the package a couple of days ago. There are actually 2 CDs in the box (no 122 page book as the ... description misleadingly indicates). I wanted to note that the VTC player crashed my Mac when using Quicktime 6 (Type 10 error when closing the application, forcing you to restart the computer). I had to uninstall Quicktime 6 and install Quicktime 5 (included on the CD) to solve the problem. Apart from that, the CDs are a nice way to learn this type of program. You can visit the VTC site to download previews of their training CDs to get an idea, but the CD quality is way better than the downloaded (compressed) version."
3,"A ""high-end"" bandana","This seemed to work but mostly because it was a bandana and less because it had the cooling crystals. The cooling crystals did work, but not for that long. Also, you have to wait a day or two for the crystals to dry out before you can use it again.I ruined mine by accidently leaving it in the water for too long. I'm not going to replace it, but it was nice while it lasted. Just use a wet bandana."
1,Disappointed,I have owned Rowenta irons for years and have to replace them about every 5 years but I don't mind they are GREAT except for this one. Bought one and had to return it -- bought a second and the same thing -- they leak (maybe pour is a better word) from every end. Just bought a 480 -- keeping my fingers crossed!
1,Total GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!,My wife and I had two Roweanta irons one as a wedding gift and one we brought ourselves. With the price you would think that you were purchasing a high end iron but it is not. Dont try to iron anything white or the brown water it spits out on a constant bases will ruin your garment. And lets not talk about how much the piece of trash cuts off. I think both irons lasted for about 1 1/2 years which doesnt say alot. I see quite a few other posts with same senitments as far as performance..wish I would have read these posts prior to buying. BUYER BEWARE!
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this ""high-end"" iron a little over three years ago, and was initially pleased with its performance. However, after only two years of relatively light service, the thermostat failed and it would no longer heat up. As it was out of warranty, I paid $32 for a repair (about 1/3 the cost of the iron) and it was in the shop for about two weeks. Less than a year later, the same problem occurred. The warranty on the repair was only six months.I contacted Rowenta over what I considered to be a defective product. Customer service offered me a very piddling rebate toward purchase of a new Rowenta.Instead, I bought a Black and Decker D2030 at less than half the price and it performs at least as well. I would never consider another Rowenta due to the quality issue and poor customer service response."
2,Water simply disappears. Styling is very poor,Very small water tank. Doesnt iron too well either. For the price it is a total ripoff.
5,Greatest Brahms 1 ever?,"Intense. Expressive. Impressive. Just about any superlative can describe this performance of the Brahms first piano concerto. Truly magical and majestic performance. Though it is quicker than most, it never sounds rushed. The first movement has a spellbinding quality that comes both from the technical mastery and the truly innate musicality that Rubinstein shows is nothing short of magical. The last movement is absolutely amazing but musically it is impossible to fault. Better than the Brendel/Abbado version. A must get, other Brahms miniatures are gems."
1,Still HATE it after all these years,"Why is the BBC releasing TRASH like Ghost Light with episodes like ROBOT, WAR GAMES, PLANET OF THE SPIDERS, BRAIN OF MORBIUS, THE DAEMONS, THE SEA DEVILS, LOGOPOLIS etc......... still waiting for eventual release who know when ?The best way to descibe Ghost Light is one word and one word only...... TRASH"
3,McCoy's best is still Who's Worst,"I am an unabashed Who lover and as big a McCoy hater. I just never appreciated him in the role, as his portrayal of the Doctor seemed to be talking down to the viwer and his quirky pronunciation and innunciation drove me nuts. THIS episode however is one of his better ones, and is highly watchable. He seems much more restrained. This may likely be due to the director of the episode who it seems kept him on a tighter leash. It is actually a pretty fun episode, though I can't help but wonder how much better this one would have been with another of the Doctors"
2,Dr Who: Ghost Light,It is easy to see why this was the final season for the longest running Drama in telivision history. Ghost Light has a weak story and is perhaps my least favorite Dr Who episode ever. It does however build a little on Ace's backstory but not enough to redeem a slow moving and at times pointless story. I would recomend this episode to only the most dedicated fans that want to build their library.
3,Exit the Doctor,"Ghost Light was the last Dr. Who produced at the BBC and ended 26 years of regular time travelling for the Doctor. If one was to describe the story in one word that word would be 'confusing'. The sets and guest cast are typically top notch for the BBC, however the plot appears to have gone missing in action.The direction is uneven and McCoy is not handled well. The viewer is left to piece together meaning from a few scaps of plot exposition. Ultimately the viewer is left unsatisfied although the story does leave behind some strong visual impressions."
1,Confusion Galore,"Ok, very disappointed, this was my first Sylvester McCoy episode and well I was thoroughly under whelmed. The plot was, well was there really a plot? Definitely didn't stand on its own well. It was confusing and all the characters seemed like they were going through motions. It left me asking myself why I paid money for this."
2,Major Audio problem,I'm pretty unhappy with this release. The music track has been remastered and is far too loud. In the original TV version it was rather subtle. In this version it is so loud that it drowns out the dialogue to the point where I really had trouble understanding what was said and had to turn the Subtitle track on.
4,Lots of Fun,"This gift was a huge hit, not only with my mother, who received it, but also with those of us who sang ""Happy Birthday"" to her because it helped keep us on key!"
2,If you really like 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' chances are this disc will be a disappointment,Listen to sound samples before buying! Compared to 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' this CD was a big let down. Gone are the collages of movie audio samples placed over dark soundscapes (although a few short 'filler' tracks reflect this style). 'Hope & Sorrow' focuses more on guest vocalist and rappers and most of the tracks fail to impress. This seems to be an attempt at more of a commercial 'dance' release than the well crafted Turntablism record that I was expecting. I 'hoped' this disc would be an excellent follow up to 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' but all I felt was 'sorrow' upon my first listen. A disappointment.
3,Jessica Simpson....yeah.,"I heard ""Always Getting Over You"" and I could have sworn it was Jessica Simpson. So I go to yahoo.com and search the title, and it says Angela Ammons. I consider for a few minutes that perhaps Jessica has a new alias.It's really uncanny how much they sound alike. She has a good voice, the only difference is Jessica has more of a range. But when Jessica's in her calm, ""quiet, breathy"" voice, it's Angela. Same thing. Some of the song styles are slightly different; Angela would be more readily accepted in the ""emo rock"" crowd. Jessica can't seem to shed her image of just straight up pop, but people, disregard the packaged product and remember these two girls' vocals couldn't be any more identical."
2,hmm...,"Some of Angela's songs are alright, I mean I liked Always Getting Over You and When It Doesn't Matter but the rest of the CD is 'ugh' for me. The song 'Big Girl' is really corny, the lyrics are really popish. I'm not a huge fan of the song Take My Hand. Anyways, I give 2 stars for 2 great songs."
4,"I Don't Know Her, But She Looks Good","I have not heard one single song from her, but she looks good. Isn't that enough to buy a CD these days?"
4,Firepower 70 round pistol hi-cap mag,"the mag works great, feeds good and it easy to do, but it didnt fit into my pistol. i have the Q7 and the mag didnt fit, i was able to get oit to fit thought swith a little sanding. Overall if it fits into ur gun buy it."
4,my opinion,My daughter likes the shoes. She said they are a little narrow in the forefoot but otherwise comfortable.
4,A new perspective on dating,"I enjoyed Rachel's newest book a lot. Once again, she is able to point out the key lessons from life experience. What is interesting is she claims that dating should be something we learn from and approach it that way, not as something to be dreaded or that we HAVE to do. Maybe she is suggesting to make it a little less serious and take it for what it is, not as a means to an end. In a society where marital status still plays heavily into how we fit in, this book encourages us to date and learn about ourselves. It's not all about husband-hunting and that is okay. Take the pressure off. Embrace this time in your life.Rachel does a good job of taking real life examples and making them pertinent to your own. You can see examples of atleast one man you have dated in this book. It's a refreshing new outlook. I really enjoyed it because it made me laugh."
2,Strange piece of editing,"People who are not sociopaths will all empathize with the tragedy that Terri Jentz had to bare and continues to bare. But this book is a tedious, self-absorbed, page after page rehash of the same events, over and over and over again. I thought I would scream if I had to read another sentence about them there girls gettin' chopped up (I think there is one form or another of chopped on almost every page). This book properly edited would likely have contained under 200 pages, instead of over 500. As my English teacher from 7th grade used to say to the class, ""Say it in one word instead of five."" Many of the sentences are absolutely painful to read, and unlike a Clifford Gertz sentence/paragraph/page, some really don't make much sense deconstructed. Is this how they write at Yale? Shame on the editors at Farrar, Straus and Giroux, whose job it is to fix broken English."
1,over written,"I enjoy true crime and a co-worker loaned me this book, telling me she had enjoyed it. I set out to read and only got about 10-15 pages and knew I was not going to enjoy it. It is over written, very difficult to slog through the pages that I did. Too much detail about small things, could have been much more concise. I returned it to my co-worker.................."
3,Too long to hold one's interest and attention,I loved the first 275 pages of Terri Jenz's beautifully written account of a horrific near-death experience and her need to comprehend it's fullest meaning in her life. But this book is verrry loooong and when I realized that a full half was to be dedicated to pure detection the book lost steam--and I lost interest.
4,An amazing elegy,"As noted, this is a whopper of a book, but so beautifully written and smartly conceptualized that it's worth the back pain you'll endure from hauling it around. Jentz is able to take her own searing experience and connect it to geography, sociology, history, literature, philosophy and probably every subcategory of science and humanities you can tick off. I think I read somewhere that a movie is in the works based on the book. In the right hands, it can be an visual extension of this evocative work."
4,"""augustabookman"" surely read some other book!","My stomach is still churning from reading the vicious review of this book by ""augustabookman."" What arrogance! What hatred! This is one sicko review. No author deserves this. I only hope Terri doesn't read this disgusting diatribe against her. The book is amazing and moving and hopefully healing for those involved. Get it. Read it. You will not be sorry!"
2,"Strange Piece, indeed","I wanted to like this book, but it falls far short of what it could have been. It is too long by half -- it's a bad sign when readers (such as this one) are eager for a book to end, instead of hoping it never does. It is filled with cliche, bathos, and endless repetition.What happened to Jentz is horrible, and she's to be commended for surviving and, now, thriving, in whatever way worked for her. She's to be commended for recognizing and naming her attack as, essentially, a (misogynist) hate crime.Sadly, that doesn't make the book worth reading."
3,Strange Piece of Paradise,My heart went out to the tragedy MS Jentz and MS Weiss faced but the book was far too long and contained far too much repetition.
5,strange piece of paradise,"Terri Jentz gives the reader an enlightening glimpse into the aftermath of survival. As she acknowledges in her book, crime victims are usually a blip in the headlines. Her journey is well-told and gripping. I felt an urgency to keep turning the page to see what happens next."
5,Spiritually uplifting and inspiring book!,"Thank you Terri for sharing with all of us your ghastly experience. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a truly 'spiritual' true crime story. I don't recommend this book to any one who has no spirituality going for them in their life, you won't 'get it'....I personally believe Terri put her heart and soul into this book, and for that I am very grateful.Again, thank you for sharing your horrific experience and the aftermath, and may you continue to heal."
2,Couldn't Plod through it,"As a huge reader and published writer, I had a helluva time getting through this book. I, in fact, didn't. I have great sympathy for Terri and her camping companion and complete admiration for her finally dealing with the whole trauma head on but for a reader this book is too difficult to slog through. The writing is neither crisp nor concise. Where was the editing on this project?"
2,Read In Cold Blood,"I am on the last leg of this book, much to my relief. It is terribly over-written, redundant and irritating to read. Jentz could learn a few lessons from Capote about creating a compelling narrative with an economy of words. Ever meet one of those people who insist on telling you in great excrutiating detail about how they were wronged? How every nuance, ambiguity and off-hand comment was a significant episode in their victimization? Even if they are factual, you reach a point where you just don't care anymore. Jentz went through an unbelievable horrible experience. Her recounting of the experience, is barely readable. Go buy In Cold Blood and read it again."
5,Profoundly Moving,"Strange Piece of Paradise is a profoundly moving and brilliantly written book. Terri Jentz opens up her deeply personal story and shows us America--a panoramic landscape that includes both depravity and compassion, terror and strength, isolation and true human connection. Like Capote's In Cold Blood, this book will be regarded as an essential portrait of our times."
4,Why the glamour photo?,"The only thing that bothered me about this book, and it has nothing to do with the book itself, is that Jentz describes herself as being a bit severe in appearance, gray-haired, her hair typically in a ponytail. Yet the author photo is of an actress-lovely woman, enormously handsome, with auburn hair most definitely not in a ponytail. It's almost as though she used a stand-in for the jacket shot. The reason it bothers me is simply that the publishing business is increasingly promoting ravishing-looking young female authors--it's been the subject of some discussion in the New York Times Book Review, so this is not some private theory of mine--and it seemed like a bit of pandering. I'm sure Terri Jentz is lovely every day of the week, but the day they shot the jacket photo she seems to have had the services of the best stylist in Hollywood."
4,"""Young children""? Not so much.","These are good for children maybe 7 or 8 years of age up through maybe 10. They use words that are too foreign, and the stories seem a little disjointed to a reader unfamiliar with figuring out WHY things in the story are happening."
3,"Great idea, OK execution.","I love the idea of this book and I LOVE most of Usbourne presses book. However, I find this too be one of my less favorites. I purchased it for bedtime stories for my son, but found the pictures not that great and too much text."
4,Greek Myths,This is a good introduction to Greek Myths for kids. The myths are short and easy to follow. My daughter is six and she frequently requests this book for her bedtime reading.
4,Classic Myths for Young Minds,"In this charming retelling of many favorite Greek myths, Heather Amery makes the age-old tales of Persephone, Pygmalion, Ulysses, and others come to life for the young reader. These stories are beautifully illuminated and perfect for reading aloud. The print is also large enough that an early reader can tackle them himself. As a bookstore employee, I enjoy using this book for in-store storytime. I highly reccomend it!"
1,Order never received.,"This book was a Christmas Gift for my grandson, Although, confirmed as delivered this is not true. All other orders with other vendors were received w/o a problem. I need a resolution to this problem."
1,Is it possible to give a NEGATIVE rating? -5 maybe?,"This album is not only horrible, it made me lose my hearing for about 3 days, I had to go get my ears checked, seriously now, NO JOKE!I used to be a huge fan of LP, but this is the worst music I have heard... BAD! REALLY BAD! Instead of moving ahead, Linkin Park steps back and into the darkness, and I mean the DARKNESS, not the evil kind, the other kind of DARKNESS, the NON-MANLY darkness...Just don't waste your money, listen to the radio... or burn a copy of your friend's CD, it's THAT BAD!"
5,"At First I was Afraid, I was petrified but....","BUT, after playing the cd from beginning to end I was very happy with Linkin Park's new album. I've heard a large number of the LP faithful are upset; I don't know why. I guess the problem is that people don't realize artists grow and change; don't compare this to Hybrid Theory because that album came out 7 years ago. That doesn't sound like a lot of time but I was 13 when that came out. At age 20, I'm a different person and so are Linkin Park, for the better. And quite frankly, this album trumps so many rock acts out now in terms of depth, variety, writing and (not counting debut acts) growth."
3,Change is not always good,"It should have been released later in the year as side project. Really-when is the real LP cd coming out. This whole cd sounds like an experiment into tapping into/copying other types of music. Some songs are different ""good"" but some just downright lame and not listenable. You know if sales arent up to their expectations-they will release a harder rap-mix of this cd. Just my opinion."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!,"This cd stinks! It is good for nothing more than a coaster or a frisbee! Rick, what happened? I love their first 2 cd's, but all of their talent has vanished. Too Bad!"
1,I refuse to accept this as Linkin Park!,This is NOT linkin park. This is a some other band singing another style of music with explicit and politically charged tracks. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM OR THEY WILL MAKE MORE OF THE SAME.
1,Linkin Park - do you even know what you're doing?,"What in the world were they thinking of? Being different or maturing does not mean mindlessly throwing everything out the window. There is not one song on this album that resembles the LP style. No rock-rap mix, no Mr Hahn and no vigor.To have listeners wait years for this album and then to come out with this is just inexcusable. Does LP even care about its fans? Or do they care about enjoying themselves more by playing around and being 'different' to entertain themselves?Or is it that band just got complacent? Too much touring, too many side projects like Mike Shinoda's Fort Minor, and not enough put into this album. They say that they wrote over a hundred songs - is that an attempt out of guilt to cover up the lack of time spent on this album? It is as if Mike Shinoda had entered the studio in the last minute from his side projects and that Joe Hahn had nothing to do with this album.Well done LP, you have just lost most of your fans."
1,Horrible album... what happened?,"I heard Bleed It Out on the radio, thought it sounded like Linkin Park did in earlier albums. That was the only good song on the album. The rest was junk, far too much politics. Linkin Park - stay with what you're good at, politics isn't it."
2,Worst LP cd,"I am a huge fan of Linkin Park, and i was vastly dissapointed in the album as the sound was not LP worthy. I recognized maybe 2 songs that sounded like them, the rest seemed like political crap that I personally don't care about. I wouldn't recommend it and hope they get back to their sound on the next one."
1,quit now LP,this band should quit while they still have two amazing albums behind them. new album sounds more like taking back sunday than linkin park. come on! this is garbage.
2,2 Stars for 2 good stars,"Extreme disappointment in this one. Huge fan of Linkin Park's previous work. More than 50% of this CD are ballads. The only two good songs are Given Up and Bleed it Out. They even dive into the political cliche with another anti-War song (Hands Held High) bashing who else, but our president. If you are going to go there you better come with Green Day quality, otherwise you are the Dixie Chicks. Do not waste your time on this CD."
3,Great Album if You've Never Listened to LP before,"If I had never heard LP before I would love this album, but for us fans who have been long awaiting this new album it is a dud. LP have lost their edge and most of their songs on this album feature only one of the vocalists (Shinoda or Chester) not both of them together like they have done in the past. With that said, I do like the album and I have listened to it over and over. I just miss what LP had brought to the table with their previous albums."
4,It is different from LP's other CD's but still GREAT music!!!,The style is completely different from any other of Linkin Park's Albums. So if you are someone that only likes that style music then don't buy and then give it a bad review! You have to enjoy music for what it is worth. I agree that I don't like All of the songs on this CD (especially the cussing in some songs) but the musicallity of this band is Amazing! If you know anything about music then you know what I am talking about. The rythms and Melodies and Perfect. No one can give this CD less then a 3 star! For me I am a HUGE Linkin Park fan! I love all the songs on their first 2 CD's Hybrid Theory and Meteora! But like I said you can't give a bad grade on a CD just because it is a different style then a band's older songs! As for me I would give it a 5 star but I don't enjoy listening to cuss-words in music! so I rest w/ 4 stars.
4,Good CD,"I bought this CD for my 15 year-old son and this is what he had to say about it: ""I like most of the songs, but there were a few that were different from what I was expecting. They were a different writing style than normal."""
2,Disappointed afters years of waiting.......,"Until now, I would have always given LP the benefit of the doubt....WOW, I had to struggle to find a couple of decent tunes. Sad to think this took three times as long to write/produce as their previous. Perhaps if they wrote with their gut and natural instinct, possibly they ""overthink"" on this one."
2,Waited for this? Ugh..,"Start out by saying I'm a big Linkin Park fan. Hybrid Theory was amazing. Reanimation was cool. Meteora good. Hell even the mash-up with Jay-Z was good. Then this. What happened? The whole idea is the combination of rap & rock, and on this CD there isn't a single song that includes both... It's like they trade off songs... Also, as if slowing and quieting all the songs down wasn't enough of a deviation from prior albums they decide they need to venture into politics and rip the President in consecutive songs... Is there really any value in a song that refers to Bush as stuttering and mumbling... he'll be out of office soon, who will want to listen back on this and think, yeah, he's right....Best song on the CD is the single, What I've Done. No surprise there. The live version of What I've Done sounds the exact same as the studio one... All in all the CD did not meet my expectations."
5,Awesome,"Not one bad song here. Not sure what the 1, 2 and 3 star reviews are all about. But then again, I am over 40 so maybe ""I just don't get it"". All I know is I like it. Or as Forrest would say, ""I like it a lot."""
4,A NEW GROWN UP LINKIN PARK,"For those of you who are out there whining because this disk is too mellow........ MELLOW OUT. These guys did.After all they're not teenagers anymore. Superb music and in an oddity two of the best tracks actually hit the air. What I've Done and Shadow of the Day are fine, fine music. Mellower [is that a word?], yes. Fine? YES.Take time to enjoy a band seeking and finding maturity in their writing and playing. Linkin Park has done just that"
4,"Different, But Good","I am not going to lie. This is not a typical Linkin Park album. And if you loved their first 2 albums, you probably won't appreciate this effort. To be honest, I didn't like the album when I first listened to it. Not one bit. ""Minutes To Midnight"" is soft-core compared to ""Hybrid Theory"" and ""Meteora"". It took a couple of listens for me to love and appreciate this album. The highlights: ""Given Up"", ""Bleed It Out"", ""What I've Done"" and ""No More Sorrow"" are fantastic rock cuts. They epitomize what Linkin Park is all about. ""Leave Out All The Rest"", ""Shadow Of The Day"" and ""Valentine's Day"" serve as refreshing ballads.I love Linkin Park and I didn't want to be too critical with this album. That is why I waited a while to write a review. Give ""Minutes..."" a chance. I am sure glad I did."
1,The singles tell what Linkin Park doesn't want you to know.,"Linkin Park has said this is their new sound. Nobody denies this album sounds waaay different than their previous genre defining efforts. Apologists for the album claim that the new sound is better, more mature, that we should embrace it. If that's true, then explain to me why the two singles chosen to be released, What I've Done and Bleed It Out, are the only two songs on the album that sound anything remotely like Linkin Park's ""old"" sound, right down to Chester screaming and Mike rapping.If the new sound isn't a bust, why are they trying to hide it behind these two songs?This album is to Linkin Park what Slang was to Def Leppard. Want to bet that just like Def Leppard, after all the public talk about how happy they are with their new sound, the band runs back to the ""less mature"" ""old"" sound on the next album? Def Leppard never recovered from claiming to have outgrown the fans of the sound that made them, will Linkin Park?"
3,"More mature, but not fist pumping effort","3 1/2 stars.If you read the CD insert, you know Linkin' Park was trying to re-create their sound and they wanted to make a more mature CD. I was prepared for this when I listened to the CD. It takes a few times to listen to, but it's worth it.I think it's a very good CD. THere's a good mix of heavy and soft songs. My favorite song on the CD is ""Shadow of the Day"" - it reminds me of U2. ""Leave Out All the Rest"" is also very good.I would imagine most people would like songs 2 and 4, but my favorite heavy songs were 6 ""No More Sorrow"" and 8 ""What I've Done.""I actually like the President Bush hate song. That's becoming a requirement on any CD that's released. All musician think they're freaking politicians - blah blah and whatever.The CD ended weak. I didn't care for the last 3 songs and they never grew on me.I wish the CD would have had more fist-pumping songs, but I enjoyed it."
5,"Amazing, just Amazing","This is just an Amazing Record, of one of the greatest bands ever, this special edition is excellent, the package and the dvd is worth the money. The package looks like a book and have some great art, the DVD is great, the video and the documentaries are great, and so is the extra stuff, i never found the screensaver tough...A very good purchase...."
2,Minutes to Bargain Basement,"I think the problem is THIS IS NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED. LP has been unique and hasn't really sounded like anyone else in the past. Now, at least in this venture--they sound LIKE OTHER BANDS (i.e. Green Day, Fall Out Boy).I guess they wanted to prove they can play instuments; and not relying on synchronized beats and hip-hop rhythms as much which predominantly commanded past tunes. I tried to listen to this CD 3 times; and I get the same feeling......not good at all; WHAT I'VE DONE, and nothing else will be remembered on this one.Bleed IT out---sounds like some 80's High School Cheer. Will the real LP please stand up, because you have Fans who are STILL WAITING FOR THE NEW LP ALBUM."
3,Not my favorite Linkin Park album,"I'm a Linkin Park fan for sure, but Minutes To Midnight just isn't my favorite album at all. I'm not really up for writing pretentious reviews with music lingo and cosmopolitan references to other bands/genres/whatever, so all I've really got to say here is that I think Linkin Park made more interesting (to me anyway) music in their previous albums. Minutes To Midnight isn't outright bad, though, and if you're a Linkin fan, it's great to have a complete set of their stuff!"
5,Uderrated,"Yes... Minutes To Midnight definently has a different sound. Most of the songs have more of a rock feel to them then Hybrid Theory and Meteora's Nu-metal sound. There isn't as much screaming and rap, although there are a few songs such as ""Given Up"" and ""Bleed it out"" which are a lot like Linkin Parks old style. Personally, I think Linkin Park did an amazing job with thier new sound, with the exception of the cussing, even if it is edited on this version of the album.(hope they don't continue with that:() Overall, I think any Linkin Park fan can enjoy this cd. Highly Recommended!!"
3,could've been better.....,"well, there's only about 4 or 5 songs on this album that i really like. in one way or the other, i feel like this album is just a step down from their previous 2 albums..."
1,Disappointing,There would be some respect had they gone and done something unique instead of ripping other artists off. I'll stick with HT and Meteora.
1,HORRIBLE,Instead of giving this CD 1 star I think I would like to change my review to 4 letters.... C R A P
1,THIS CD SUCKS! LINKIN PARK TRIES TO BE ANOTHER ROCK BAND NOT LINKIN PARK,"This is a good cd...had it been a new band coming out that wasnt Linkin Park. Linkin Park has built its name on the fusion of synthesizing great beats and rhythms along with hard rock & rap. As a former die hard fan their music was classic even before it was classic...if you know what I mean.However because they chose to become beyond commercial with their latest ""regular"" rock music I give this CD TEN THUMBS DOWN because the general consesus agrees with me: THIS CD SUCKS! (read more reviews) If your a linkin park member reading reviews on AMAZON know that you dissappointed your fans. Stick to what your good at and dont be another rock band, they are a dime a dozen...which is about what I should have paid for this lame cd.Here is some advice: dont think that you cant lose your fan base because your linkin park. Your name means nothing if your music isnt what we expect and want. Supply and Demand!"
2,Barely Worth It,"Die hard linkin park fans (most anyway) are going to ignore how terrible this album really is. I've always like linkin park music, hybrid theory was good and meteorea to. It is good to experiment with your musical style, look at nine inch nails with the hit Year Zero. Yet, a lot of the mixing and sounds on the album are just plain stupid. There are some reasons to like this album. Given Up is a good track, and honestly What I've Done is a nice alternative rock song. The ""classic rock, hip-hop"" feel is not here at all though. The songs Bleed It Out and Hands Held High are two of the most ridiculous songs the band as even thought up. They had a good thing going with Qwerty if they had built an album around that."
2,I miss Linkin Park sound!!!!,"Hi I'am a super huge fan of linkin park I have all their cd's. And was expecting like all of you to get a listen of linkin park new cd. I heard What I've done and I thought: hey is not bad. But once I got a hold on the cd I was in total shock!!It completely lack of the formula that made Linkin park to grow in to be the most sucessful band in the world!I don't know what they were thinking, I keep on looking in the near future so they can realize the big mistake they have made and fix it.Overall, there are just like one or two songs with the sound of the first cd's of the band!Not recommend buying unless you want to have all the cd's."
2,what a mess!,"Linkin Park went from good to great with their release of their second album Meteora. This album has traces of Meteora - yet it is seeded with this totally downbeat slow tempo songs and Nickleback type of rock sound.I say there are about 4 songs that are good Linkin Park. The album feels totally incomplete, as if they did not have enough time or desire to make a couple of more good songs. I say; 4 more good songs along with an intro/outro would make this album a 10 song hit. Oh-well... $12 in my pocket.BTW: 'In between' - I don't consider that a song. The dude just talks you through the song. It is not singing."
2,Just not as good.,"This album can't and doesn't compare to there first two. It isn't a Rock album but a ""Lite"" Rock Album. Which also has two rock songs and two rap/rock songs on it that coincidently also happen to be the best songs.The other songs consist of primarily ballads and a few songs that will just plain put you to sleep. Theres nothing wrong with the lighter Rock that should typically show off the singers vocals. Instead of off the charts vocals like we know Chester Bennington can do they are pretty dull just like the music.Your not going to hear much but averageness if you listen to this entire album."
3,not the same anymore,"when i first heard them on their first CD, i couldn't stop listening to them, but with this Album, it doesn't give me that same feeling. I still enjoy the two previous albums more than this one!Cons:* where's the rapping? b/c LP suppose to be a combination of Rap and Rocknow it's just Rock,* WHERE IS MR.HAN in THIS??? i loveee the scratching of the turntables!!! (very minimum)* does not get me pump up, and i LP sounds use to get all pump upI wouldn't say it's a waste to get the CD, but if u are expecting the same feeling when u listened to Linkin Park, it's not...well that's my 2 cents =P"
4,it's ayight.......,"softer then previous outings, not bad though. like other LP, still good summer time listening.one thing i do have to say, Track #4, definitely, definitely, definitely needs MORE COWBELL!!!!"
3,Why Rick Rubin? WHY?,"This album was very dissapointing. After loving the first album I couldnt wait to hear Meteroa and it surpassed expectations. I went into this one the same way and it failed hard. There are a couple pretty good songs which is why I gave it 3 stars, but not nearly up to par with Linkin Park in the past. It's not as heavy, the Mike Shinoda rap songs are slow and non-interesting, and there are a couple political boring songs as well.Rick Rubin is a legendary producer and I respect him, but he really needs to stick with hip hop. Every time a rock band decides to go to Rick Rubin for their new album, it winds up being bad. The same thing happened to the Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Weezer for example. I don't know why they decided to go this direction but I can only hope that they go back to their old sound on their next one... too bad we're gonna have to wait another 2-3 years to find out..."
2,This new direction makes no sense...,"Hybrid Theory, although short, was simply brilliant. Meteora try to recapture that magic and was quite good overall. This new release, Minutes to Midnight, just doesn't make any sense.When legendary producer, Rick Rubin, came on board I figured that he would take them to new heights. Longer, more complex tunes, and maybe a bridge or a solo here and there. But this was not to be. Balllads, ballads, and for something different.... we get MORE BALLADS.Each song on its own is listenable, I guess. Overall this highly-polished mellow fest is NOT what we want to hear from LP. I'm sure that over the next five years well have to endure a few remix, mash-up versions of this CD, and maybe they'll get their act together when their new one hits in 2019."
2,They're Gonna Lose Lots of Fans With This One,"I was ecstatic that they were having a new album, but I'm not only disappointed in it, I'm annoyed. Not only is the album worse than their previous ones, but the CD sucks in itself.It's not something I can listen to again, except for about 4 tracks. Most of the songs are much slower (but not in that good 'My December' way) and do not have that rhytmical rock quality that I so loved. They need faster guitar melodys and way more drums. Better luck next time, I hope."
2,Negative,"I do like Linkin Park, but this album is something completely different from their original stuff. It has more of a softer side to it that just doesn't seem to flow together. Where they were going with this I have no idea. Im sure there are a few people that will like it, but the majority will be very disappointed. I believe what happened here was they rushed to put an album together b/c Mike Shinoda broke off from Linkin Park to go with Fort Minor. Plus I think they tried to do something a little different here, other then their NU Metal sound the had originally. Don't get me wrong there are a couple of tracks I do enjoy, but those tracks were quite a bit like there old stuff. I suggest you listen to the cd before you buy it, cuz it just might be a waste of money."
2,Disappointed LP Fan,"I can't believe I have been waiting 4 years for this garbage. Linkin Park sounds like a completely different band on Minutes to Midnight. There are only 2-3 good songs and even those can't hold a candle to the worst songs on their previous albums. If you want to hear some songs that sound like the old LP, sign up for the LP Underground. The LPU membership comes with a CD that contains a few tracks that didn't make it onto the album. QWERTY, a great song that was supposed to be part of the album, made it onto the LPU v6 CD."
2,Rage Against the Machine v2.0?,"I've loved Linkin park for 6 years now, and still have the first 2 cd's on my playlists after all this time... but this cd is completely different.First of all, like others have said, those tracks like ""in the End"" and ""Faint"" don't really exist in this cd, sadly.Second, the lyrics are crap. It's a lot of political, anti-war, anti-bush nonsense. I hate wars and Bush as much as the next guy my age, but I don't want to hear it in music. I much preferred the angst ridden, depressing, and self realization lyrics of the prior cd's.Third, wtf?So yeah, I like about 4 songs on it, so far. However, like The Open Door, I'll probably adjust after listening to it more and more."
5,Not your old Linkin Park but still a great album,"I had read them say prior to this albums release that this was going to be a completely different sounding album, two thoughts came to mind ""uh-oh"" and ""Yeah right, every band says that."" But it is a different sound, and it is a great album, bands need to evolve otherwise they just release the same CD over and over with different lyrics.The only thing I don't like about this album is that they don't have that rap-rock sound to them anymore, its a much more emotional sound which is fine. But Fort Minor takes care of the rap shtuff for ya (even if he talks about how they wanted to take rap out of LP on there)Sum it up... buy it"
2,Barely listenable....,"A few decent tracks, but a vast departure from the Linkin Park of old. Instead of taking the well mastered synthesized overtones from their prior albums which were everpresent throughout each song, they seem to utilize more naturally occuring sounds as the base of their music.Which makes it just sound horrible. For the most part, the album is soft.....too soft. The lack of their mastered sound makes the music all but mainstream rock. Then to mix in the politics.....Like I said, a few decent tracks. The album for some reason feels more like a ""prequel"" CD....something that should have come before Hybrid Theory. Sadly, as with most third albums, groups tend to try new avenues which either do extremely well as the band has matured along with it's audience....or it flops. I feel in this case, it is the latter."
3,Not to good but not to bad,"got to admit im a little disapointed with the new album i was hoping it would be more like Hybrid theory or meteora or have tracks that are like points of authority or faint but maybe its good that LP are trying something new and more serious but the album itsnt a complete disater, i think it would be better if LP did another album that it contains more of what LP have really strong talent for ,which is mixing rap and rock,it would be a great idea if they did another renaimation album like they did before the last one was AMAZING!But i will always remain a loyal fan to linkin park."
4,Give LP a Break,"Yes the new Linkin Park CD is different, and if you have been reading ANYTHING written or said by LP, you would realize that this is what they wanted. Instead of selling out and just making multiple albums with the same style as Hybrid Theory and Meteora, they decided to enjoy themselves and and try something new. Give the guys credit for keeping it real and not making a CD just for money. If they had been in it for the money, why has it been four years since Meteora? The point is this: Linkin Park wanted to create a new sound (and is it ever) and enjoy the process. This CD is different than the previous two, but for those of us who aren't looking for stereotypical nu-metal Linkin Park, this CD gives us something different to enjoy. I'm glad they didn't just make the same old style songs. Basically, if you like LP, buy this album, unless of course you wanted an album in which they completely sold out."
2,REALLY NOT A GOOD ONE....,"After 2 really good albuns, HYBRID THEORY and METEORA, Linkin Park really turns me off of their sound with minutes to midnight...besides WHAT I'VE DONE and GIVEN UP, i don't really like any other song...they COMPLETELLY changed their metal rap sound for some emo without attitude or inspiration....Really not a good one...stick with the first 2 LP albuns..."
2,LP What happened?,"Alright so I heard Bleed it out on the radio and was enticed to want to get this album in some way shape or form. After I got it I was so bummed out. I am seeing a whole Limp Bizkit fiasco again. They gave us hard rock to start out with and some rap... now its all poppy and makes me wanna vomit. If you like their slow songs then this cd is for you, but if your a hard rocker then stay away... horrible"
2,Disappointment supreme,"If this brief review keeps one person from buying this album then it will be a success. What happened to LP? Every song on this album is worse than the worst song on either of their first albums. I am very disappointed and if I could return the CD I would. What happened to the heavy instrumentals? What happened to the lyricism? What happened to the electronic influences? Minutes to Midnight is worse than bad, it's BORING."
1,At least it made me laugh,"This CD is lowest-common denominator turd, and definitely not up to par with Meteora or Hybrid Theory. Linkin Park is trying to be ""cool"" by cussing in a couple of songs, but it just makes them seem more pathetic. The rapping, which was one of Linkin Park's best attributes, is almost absent on this CD, and it seems they have just become another emo band. It does get one star for making me laugh once (the lyrics to Valentine's Day made me howl so hard I almost fell off my chair: I never knew what it was like / to be alone on a Valentine's Day,). Seriously, quit whining Chester, nobody cares; quit writing emo music and grow up.The worst album of 2007 thus far."
1,I respect them for trying something new...But this album isn't LP,"I respect them for moving on and trying something new. When I had first heard they were going to do that I was excited. I loved LP for thier heavy guitar rifts and they way they conveyed thier lyrics in a extreme manor.However this album is just not what I expected at all. It just didn't do it for me. It's way to slow. It's not that I don't like it, It's just not the same LP ""AT ALL"". They went from one end of the spectrum to the other in too drastic of a time period. They needed to cut a record that had both thier styles on it beforee this one so you kind of new where they were headed before this one came out. It's like they were hard one day and emo the next. Also, what's with the swearing? I swear tons so it's not that It burns my ears. It's my kids! I didn't mind them listening to LP at all. I didn't have to sensor thier music. I pretty disapointed as far as that goes. Anyway to sum it all up...""To much change, To drastically""!"
4,Terrific,This is some of their best work yet. I was really impressed by the versatility of this album. You can tell they put a lot into it.
2,Not The Linkin Park That I'm Used To,"If you liked their latest music video, then this album should apply to you. If you thought that it was a little on the soft side, then don't bother buying Minutes to Midnight because I thought the whole album was too soft. Definitely not the hard hitting rythm and lyrics that earlier albums offered."
5,better than I expected,"i like the new style. some people don't, but I like to think I'm a little more open-minded about my music. I like lots of different types, even if this doesn't sound like traditional LP. give it a shot."
2,what happened to LP??,WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO LP??? THEY SOUND LIKE SOME KIND OF CHRISTIAN BAND. I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAITED THIS LONG FOR THIS. IT'S LIKE THEY ALL WENT THROUGH SOME EMOTIONAL EVENT AND GOT SOFT. I THINK PREVIOUS FANS WILL HATE THIS.
1,What the Hell Linkin Park,"I am a huge Linkin Park fan. I practically memorized their old cds i like them that much, which is why Minutes to Midnight is such a disappointment. Gone is the hard rocking-rock/rap that I loved and what made them famous and in its place is a cd of poorly done balads. Chester & Mike DONT SHARE ANY TRACKS. No tracks with an awesome rap beat mixed with a hardcore rock song, its not there at all, its really terrible. This cd is so terrible that after listening to it once I may never listen to it again and just hope that they come out with something better in a couple years. Then again they could put out an album of dogs barking to a rock/rap beat and it would be better then this piece of garbage. I never write reviews for music but I felt obligated for this one. If you are a Linkin Park fan, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. Just pretend that they never put out a new album and wait patiently for them to come to their senses."
1,Jeez,"I want to say first that I love Linkin Park and every CD they have put out to this point. This CD however is the worst. To be perfectly honest after listening to the CD it sounded as if Avril Lavigne wrote their lyrics and Good Charlotte wrote their beats.I mean honestly, how do you go from collaborating with Jay-Z to this? Also I'm sorry, but the song Hands Held High is trite. I'm all for speaking out but this smacks of bandwagon jumping.Just my 3 cents."
2,End of Linkin Park,"When I first saw that Linkin Park had a new album, I was psyched to get the copy. I bought it at a Target (which only sold it coupled with one of their books) for over $20!! I played it about 3 times and can honestly say if you like the traditional Linkin Park, then you may find 1-2 songs worth while. Other than that, it was like listening to a band that once ruled the metal world for 25 years and now they wanted to do a ""personal"" album. However, these guys have not been around long enough to claim this type of work. If I could return used CDs, I would have. Not a good buy, save your money for a 1995 Led Zeppelin album."
2,Wow. This is really not what I expected.,"It's like they took everything about what made Linkin Park cool and fresh and new and made it old and annoying. Sappy, boring ballads, overcooked Shinoda raps, I could go on for a while on this one. What a disappointment. Last song is kinda cool, so 2 stars. I could've heard Sting sing it with better results. Go back to the formula that works (Hybrid Theory, Meteora). How many years did I wait for this? Humbug. Want a true masterpiece? NIN-Year Zero FTW."
2,Casual fan - this doesn't do it for me,"Having listened to LP for their first two CDs as well as the Reanimation disc, I can say for a fact that this album is a letdown for anyone expecting the same Linkin Park. Every band's sound evolves and changes over time, but this is lacking to the Nth degree.The same song structure is used all too often, as was the case throughtout the first two CDs. The problem here is that the music just isn't as hard as it used to be. This would be fine if the lyrics could move it forward, but the lyrics are mostly weak, uninspired, and can't do the job of driving the music at all. Chester takes most of the vocals, which is fine, but Mike is underused as a result. It really sounds like they're trying to throw stuff at a wall to see what sticks...If you're a die-hard, you might like it more. But for someone like me who listens to the band only every now and then, its farewell Linkin Park."
3,I dunno....,"When I heard this CD the first time I did not enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed LP's older CDs. I have to be honest and state that I was disappointed. Fans had waited so long for LP to release new material only to find that they had changed so much. I undertand that change is good but I think they were too drastic and I don't enjoy it nearly as much as I do their older material. They mentioned that they no longer wanted to be part of the rap-rock ""nu metal"" genre but their old sound is what made them. To have them turn their backs on it sucks. After having listened to the CD more often, I can say that this is a decent CD, but not up to LP's standards. I am not sure what I feel about the CD anymore and sadly, being confused about your favorite band's latest CD is not a good thing.I still love LP and they are still one of my favorite bands but I hope they go back to their roots in the future."
3,It's an ok album,"I've been a pretty hardcore LP fan since the beginning and had been highly anticipating their next CD. However, I did purchase this album with some temerity because of the reviews it was receiving and the description of the new songs, particularly by the band themself. I think the album is ok - not exactly my musical style, but not unexpected either. It is good to see the band has grown some and is expanding their horizons to show their growth - really, who wants another album with more of the same stuff, even if it is LP. The songs are decent and are still LP-ish. However, being someone who likes the heavier music, this didn't quite meet my tastes and I won't be adding it to my MP3 player or carrying the CD around in my car."
4,"Not ""traditional"" Linkin Park, but good...","This is a very different sounding Linkin Park than the first two albums. It took me a few spins listening to the disc, but now I actually like it...a lot. There isn't too much Mike S found on this disc, and where he does appear I'm not so sure it sounds very good. This whole disc is very very slow. Missing is the hard rock....still a good disc in my opinion though."
2,Has anyone seen LP?,"Some of the rough edges of the first 2 albums were covered by an emotion that represented real expression. This album lacks both. Essentially, they have released a compilation of emotionless, ""power"" ballads. The angst has been replaced by the awkard insertion of cursing and prolonged single scream in each song. If I wanted to hear Sublime, I'd buy their album."
2,Linkin Park's MtM is not for me.,I guess I was expecting this album to have the same level of energy as the previous two CDs. This one just does not do it for me. Mike does not rap as much he did before. Chester did not have his usual lyrics where he is screaming at the top of his lungs and gets your heart thumping. This is a BIG disappointment. Two out three ain't bad.
1,They released the B-Sides album first,"I'm not a Nu-metal junkie. LP is the only Nu-metal band I own CD's of. I love HT and Meteora, they're great to workout to and have strong driving music. This album sounds like a CW television series soundtrack. Don't buy this POS!"
3,One of the most disappointing albums of the year.,"I was not prepared for what I found on this album. ""What I've Done"" was a good tune, and I was hoping for much more along the same lines as that and previous hits. To me, while this is not a terrible album, it was just such a departure from their previous albums that I just can't get into it. It doesn't rock hard. The sound production sounds great, but the tunes are mostly mellowed out and sound made for pop radio. I may still listen to this on occasion, but for me, this just didn't cut it. Maybe it will grow on me over time. But I doubt it. The new Finger Eleven cd gave me the same feeling. The lead-off single was really a good song, and the rest of the cd is watered down, practically acoustic stuff, which has it's place, but come on! Are they purposely trying to alienate certain fans? It seems like it to me.Oh well, they were never one of my favs anyway."
1,change is good but this just sucks,seriously.i say to all bands out thereif you want to write music about how you feel and want it heardwrite a ********* solo albumdont ruin the band youre withi have few words to say for this albumyes change is goodbut this is just horriblei couldnt get though 3 songswithout wanting to throw it out the windowdo new but mix oldit worksand i hope to god they dont tour this album
1,What were they thinking?,"Horrible is about the only word for this album. I heard they had over 100 songs to choose for this cd, and these are what they chose? It felt like I was back in the 80's for a few songs, clapping in the background and everything...rubbish."
2,INCREIBLEMENTE malo!!!!!!,"Es un increíble que una banda que vendió millones de copias de sus dos primeros albumes, saque al mercado un cd tan malo. Si eres un fanático de Linkin Park, no lo compres porque ten la seguridad que te defraudarás!!"
2,Ballad Park???,"When the single(What I've Done) was released I was hoping it was one of the softer songs on the album... Wrong! There is only one or two songs on the album that are harder/heavier. Most of the other songs are ballad-like.The album has a U2 feel to it, which is not a bad thing. However, as everyone else is saying, it is not the Linkin Park sound that...well...makes Linkin Park who they are. Perhaps they are trying to redefine themselves.It is just not the sound that Linkin Park fans have come to expect from Linkin Park. Very little of the heavy screaming, heavy guitar munging, and angry rap."
1,Linkin Park turned gay,"This album might be a good piece of work (IMO it is not). But the problem is that it bears the Linkin Park brand. This is simply not Linkin Park even though it was made by the same people. If this was the first album to be released, they would not achieve the fame and popularity they have today. Do not touch this album at all."
1,EMO,"If you were wondering how their new music would sound, what genre they were going to get placed into now that they decided to go another way, then the best I can come up with is that they have joined the emo mainstream. Listening to their new music wants me to slit my wrists, its so panzyish that all i visualise during the songs is a blooming field of pink tulips with all band members groping eachother. Very soft songs, very sappy lyrics, a mix between new kids on the block and jimmy eat world."
1,Ummm...,When did Linkin Park add 2 members and become EMO? There is only one word to describe this album which has 2 good songs: AWFUL
5,give them a break,I'M seeing all these bad reviews but i agree with the guy who wrote that this album will be green day's american idiot. i think its awesome.totally from begining to end
1,I was a proud Linkin Park fan,What a sad day for linkin park. I have to admit that these guys were over played badly on the radio and i had to take a break but never did I stop saying that they were great at what they did and did it like no other. I have to say after listening to this cd I nearly cried because it's so disappointing. I thought to myself... and this is Linkin Park sounding washed up.
3,"It's good, it's bad, it's okay, eh...it's kinda whatever","Yes, most reviews you read about Minutes To Midnight are negative. ""There are many slow songs"" ""There aren't any songs you can rock out to"" ""There is no more rap that made Linkin Park unique in the first place"". Truth is, most of these reviews ARE true. However, that doesn't mean the songs are bad. I actually prefer the ""no rap"" Linkin Park, but I wish the ""no rap"" songs were ones you can actually rock out to. There are some really, REALLY good stand out songs, but only 4 or 5 of those are on this album. I hope Linkin Park releases a better album in the near future after they realize what fans are saying. Don't neglect this album; it's decent, but not the best it could have been."
2,Would the real Linkin Park please stand up?,"I have one question for Linkin Park, did your ****s fall off or something? I mean, I like slow dinky piano numbers as much as the next guy/girl, but not from LP! I recommend you dust off Hybrid, Meteora, and even Reanimation and listen to Faint and both versions of With You. When I listen to those numbers, it feels like my head is ripped off, thrown around, and reattached feeling better than ever. I'm happy to pay the speeding tickets your music causes. This album, however, was hugely disappointing. I have to check the cover to make sure it isn't Duran Duran reborn or something. I give the album 2 stars because there are some brief glimpses of the old you. Please rediscover that magic. Otherwise, you'll just become another rock band. We don't need another Nickleback, as successful as they are. Bring back the old LP and you'll sell gazillions of albums. Don't try to be something you're not, lame, at least until now."
2,"Used too Love them, now I'm not so sure!","Wow, Linkin Park used to be one of our favorite bands....until this album came out! What a disappointment! It sounds nothing like LP and to be honest I'm not sure it sounds like anybody...and thats not a good thing!I will give them another shot on their next album, but if it doesnt change then...See Ya LP!P.S. this is kind of like what happened to Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Deftones, Sevendust...etc, bands get too comfortable and want to attempt to ""CHANGE""...well I am afraid I know how this story is going to END!"
2,Minutes to boredom,"Many bands are cursed with being under a certain genre. They're known for a certain style and if anything changes in that style, there's a big risk. Some work out well, others don't. This one is the latter.LP was known for having no cuss words in their lyrics. They were able to communicate anger, fear and other negative attitudes through passionate words and screaming vocals. Now they've replaced it with cuss words and sappy boy band clean vocals. ""What I've done"" is the best song on the album only because of the lyrics. That's the only reason this reviewer gave it two stars.The nu-metal music is gone as well. It's mostly replaced with easy-going guitar riffs and lazy beat box sounds. Not impressive.If you're an LP fan and wanted a new Meteora or Hybrid theory; it won't be on this album."
3,Just okay,"This CD was okay. It would have probably even been good if I hadn't been spoiled by their first two albums. There was not a single song on either of their first two albums that I didn't absolutely love. This album has a couple of really good songs and a whole lot of filler, which is typical of most albums out there. I just expected more from LP than I do from most bands.I like ""Given Up"" and ""What I've Done"" (over-hype and all), and the rest of the songs are okay except ""Bleed It Out"" - that one just reminds me of a square dance and I always want to jump up and swing my partner. If you don't get distracted by the square dance beat, though, it's also an okay song.Bottom line: this CD is not a total waste. It's just not as good as I thought it would be."
3,Meh....,"Honestly, I respect the band's decision to branch out for something new. Everyone comes to a moment like that in their life and most of the time more than once. However, that being said, I did expect more than this. With a band having as much success as LP has, of course the 3rd release is going to carry on expected hype. The new sound doesnt stick quite as well as LP had wished and it's evident in the feedback from the masses. I saw them at the Bamboozle festival in NJ right before the release. Their live show is still one of the best in mainstream American rock you can find. As far as recorded material goes, something tells me the guys are going to be headed back to the studio to do SOMETHING a lot faster than they expected. With the lackluster response to Minutes To Midnight, LP wont survive another 3years gap in between releases."
4,"Different, but still good","The songs that really appeal to me are Bleed it Out and What I've Done. Some of the other songs just don't quite fit. In other words, the calmer, ballad-type songs are alright, but what happened to Shinoda on this album? I wanted a better mix/use of Shinoda and Chester."
1,Listen before you buy!!,"I have never written an online review before, but I feel pretty strongly about this. I love Linkin Park's first two CD's. I bought this one based on what the other CD's were like and off of their hit single ""what ive done"". The rest of the CD ""minutes to midnight"" sound nothing like their first two CD's. It is largly hip-hop style with very little musical complexity. I was extremely discapointed with this release. So, please, Listen before you buy.I give this CD a 1 star because I did like one song."
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!,"I love Linkin Park, I have been to quite a few shows and thoroughly enjoy their music but this is not Linkin Park. If your into the more eclectic/ soft style with no beats or drums its all yours. The rock has died out of them. Don't waste your money, the only good song on the album is on the radio and that I am sure will get played out."
1,"Not a good LP CD, not a good CD in general.","Be weary of people who rate this album 5 stars. 5 means perfection, music that will stand the test of time. This, citizens of rock; is not even close. I will be honest, I like me some Linkin Park. I have seen them twice in concert and in general, I enjoy their music. I don't worship them or write 8 page diatribes in their defense if someone decides to flame them. This album has to be heard to be believed. I was moved by it, moved to come on here and warn people that this not what you expect. Whatever idea you have of this album it wont be that. There are no punch to the songs. They removed every musical aspect which made them, them. I mean, honestly the songs simply put, the songs aren't any good.In a interview they said they made hundreds of songs and these made pick. Linkin Park, did you even listen to this album before you presented it to us, your fans? This is awful you should be ashamed of yourself, go to your room."
1,This can't be Linkin Park,"If I wanted to listen to a Lilth Fair album, I would've just bought a Lilth Fair album!"
4,A good change that isn't to abrupt,"This is Linkin Park's third original studio album. First of all I am tired of all the people who hate this album and compare it to Hybrid Theory. Hybrid Theory was a long time ago. Every band has a right to go through musical changes. Not every album is goin to be a carbon copy of Hybrid Theory. Now that thats's out of the way, this albuim felt very new and less rap centered like their older stuff. I don't like rap. It just doesn't sound like music. I was able to enjoy Linkin Park a lot more with Minutes to Midnight. The opening track Wake is an intro with great guitar that leads into Given Up. The track order gives a rise and fall feel to the album where one song is very aggressive and the next is sad and slow. My favorite song is Valentine's Day, a sad very poetic song in which the singer must spend Valentine's Day after the loss of his lover. In summary this is a great album that every Linkin Park fan should try."
2,The same band...?,"If you are used to the old Linkin Park style and are familiar with any of their older CD's, this one will definitely shock you. When I first heard it, I couldn't believe how much they had changed. Change isn't always bad, but in their situation it is. Before, they were a unique band with very defined vocals and now they just sound like any other band. Very disappointing..."
1,"LP,s WORST","I waited for so many years for a Linkin park studio album after Meteora and was left totally disappointed.I have been a great fan of LP since their Hybrid theory days, but what I heard from Minutes to midnight sounded like most of the Boybands and left me utterly confused.It sounded like a mixture of all the bands like Backstreet boys, N sync, a little dose of Red hot chilli peppers, Bon Jovi...etc.I hope they go back to where they started from otherwise they,ll end up loosing a lot of FANS....."
5,The Best,This is one of their best CD's. It's different and a little more grown up but it still rocks.
1,It's Craptastic!,"I fell in love with LP from their Meteroa so when I say they had a new something out I was very happy but that ended quick. From the first song where you here nothing but the f-bomb dropped way to many times and then it came, the clapping. I was thinking, ok this is new and if its only one song then hey I can get past it, but it wasn't. It continued on through the sappy, boring songs till I felt like I was at a LP revival meeting. I was looking for the collection plate to be passed. After that I stopped it and after my ears stopped bleeding (and not in a good way) I threw it away.I just don't get what the heck happen or what the crap they were thinking when they made this. I am a bit dumbfounded."
1,Blech.,"I read all the reviews. I tried not to listen. I thought to myself, being ""old"" now (30) that the kids never give some different a fair shake. And like Metallica, I was wrong. This does not belong in the same category as previous works. I can understand bands wanting to branch out and do something different. Its hard to believe they play the same songs in concerts tour after tour after tour. But if you want to release an album for the John Tesh radio show, then lets market it straight to adult contemporary, shall we? Quit pretending you rock!"
1,AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!,Since I'd been waiting for their new album for long time I am so dissapointed in their new album. It was kinda interesting because they tried new style but that's not Linkin Park and that's not Linkin Park I love! I don't know what happened to them. It didn't feel like Linkin Park at all.
1,they lost it,"I used to be a big linkin park fan. This cd is not good, the first single to come out ""What I've done"" is total phoney garbage. No melody or rythm....avoid this"
1,Disappointment- mediocre at best,"With all the excitement and a single like What I've Done coming from this album you would think Linkin Park was going to deliver. You would be wrong if that's what you assumed. It seemed to me they decided to overhaul their style, with very poor results. The only song I enjoyed was What I've done which was released as a single quite a while ago. My call on this: save your money and buy what I've done on iTunes.I feel ridiculous with all my references being to that one song, but seriously, the rest is trash."
2,Long the wait... big the dissapointment,"I have been waiting the 3rd Linkin Park album as many other fans for so long. But after listening it for the first time, I got really dissapointed. I can say that is the first time I bought an album and only liked about 2 or 3 songs. The rest of the album sounds all the same boring stuff.They for sure have credit for trying something different, but for the next one, they should try to do an album with much more variety.Also, for some reason I don't like the sewaring in this album. Nothing against it, I listen bands like Nine Inch Nails, Garbage or Green Day that make it sound good in their respective albums, but for some reason I don't think it sound really good in a Linkin Park album."
3,"If it isnt broken, why fix it?","the linkin park crew were pretty vocal that this album was different from their previous stuff, and boy were they right. This is much much softer, and lacks that linkin park sound. Frankly, they sound like a boy band for the bulk of this cd. Its annoying, because the songs arent that far off from being great, but they are all missing that extra oompf....that ""shut up when im talking to you"" moment, know what i mean?if youre a die hard linkin parker, buy the album, but dont have high expectations. if youre a passive fan of theirs, skip this album, it lacks what makes the band great."
2,Biggest Disappointment of the Year!!!,"I really don't know what disappointed me more, Metallica's St. Anger or Linkin Park's Minutes to Midnight. They really screwed up on this one. Now I am worried about what Rick is going to do to Metallica's new one due out later this year. I hope their new one is better than this. Too much change is just as bad as no change at all. They should have balanced out the songs better. The best LP new song can heard on YouTube. In search, type in Linkin Park and Qwerty. Believe it or not, this song did not make it to the new album. What the hell were they thinking!!"
4,Quick,Received this product quickly and sooner than specified. The quality of the cd is in great shape. Thank you.
1,What happened?,"I heard the ""what I've Done"" on the radio and went out and bought the album--I had been waiting like the others on this site for them to release one for what felt like forever....NOT the stuff I expected. Almost FELL ASLEEP driving listening to the other songs on the CD. Buy the single, not the album."
2,Don't listen,"To the supposed musically enlightened people that tell you to give this album a break. They could have come up with this garbage in year 1 of their hiatus. I'm not sure how they can spin that this piece of junk took 4 years to make. I call a major BS, and I love LP. Why change? Why fool millions and millions of fans into buying this bust? How do you tour and play these songs?It's almost like an action/thriller author deciding to write a romance novel. I suggest borrowing someones copy or ripping it. $10 is too much to pay for this one. Sorry LP fans."
3,it's ok,There are a few good songs but the rest is not my case. I guess it because their music is gradually getting worse and worse...
1,This is Not LP This is Rick Rubin Puppets,"Hi Guys!This is coming from the heart, I am true LP fan, but this album is the last nail in coffin for my respect for them. I mean first it was ""Minutes to Midnight"" then ""Thousand Suns"" and now this piece of crap, I mean where as the Hybrid Theory, Metero , Linkin Park are gone?? Damn you Rick Rubin you destroyed a great band! Damn you!If you have any Brains guys(talking to LP) Please get rid of this Piece of crap! Producer"
4,linkin park mintues to midnight,this cd isn't as good as the previous Linkin Park cd's. don't listen to it that often. and i didn't realize when i bought it that it had all the bad words beeped out. wish there was more of an idication of that.
5,Best CD yet,"I absolutely love Linkin Park. I have loved every CD they have made, but this CD topped them all. I have listened to it more times than I have listened to most of my other CDs. Linkin Park is a completely original sound and this CD proves that more than any of the others. If you actually listen to the lyrics, you will be amazed at the depth of the songs. Great buy!"
5,A New Vivid Chapter for LP,"Honestly, I've got to say that, for the most part, Linkin Park has taken a very risky path by changing and exploring the depths of, what can possibly be, one of the greatest albums of 2007. ""Minutes to Midnight"" is a new chapter in LP's odyssey, and I truly respect that. There has been quite a bit of debate on LP's change of sound and style, but one has to remember that they're growing up, and I'm glad for them. Chester and everyone in the band has a vision-one that will leave us singing their melodies forever!"
2,Terrible / Garbage,As a very enthusiastic and loyal linkin park fan this cd is horrible. This is what we have been waiting 4 years for? If they release another wierd cd like this that doesn't have the linkin park feel that we have all been waiting for since meteora came out and for some since hybrid theory they will start losing a lot of fans. For the amount of time they put in between alblums they should release with a better product. The only reason this gets two stars instead of one is because it's by linkin park.
2,Will the real linkin park stand up?,"In case you havent picked up on it from the other reviews - this album is a serious departure from what you might expect from Linkin Park. I'm totally open to change with bands, but , I guess this is a perfect example that its not always for the better. TO me, LP means Intensity... songs that make you want to break something, get up, run as fast as you can until your lungs feel like they are going to explode. None of this music will give you that emotion. As said I can understand, that bands change - I think this is SO much of a departure its hard to adjust. Rest in peace LP."
3,Here is the problem,"The problem is this isn't a bad record, but for Linkin Park I expected more. They are slow putting out albums so we should get more. The second album was just as good as the first, if not better. This album is definately not up to par with the first two albums. The sound is so different, not to say it's bad. However, LP gave up rap metal which was a big mistake because that was their specialty. This album is too different and it's like their copying U2 on many tracks. They should have kept the rapping, etc. Where is Mr. Hahn on this record? Is he really still part of the band? They should have stuck to what they know. This record would be great for anybody else, but not LP. I'm very disappointed they didn't change their sound, but without abandoning the rapping and Mr. Hahn's talents. Thats what made this band so special afterall."
3,I'm shocked!,"Where are the guys from Linkin Park and who are these wimpy imposters? Seriously, this album is very soft and lacks any style that made LP famous in the first place. After listening to LP Underground 6.0 I was so stoked to here what was coming next. Songs like QWERTY, Reading My Eyes, and even the live piano rendition of Pushing Me Away totally rocked. Someone please wake me up from this horrible nightmare known as Minutes to Midnight. I'll just pretend they didn't release this sorry album. All of this coming from a HUGE LP fan!"
2,A rare Rick Rubin miss...,"Rick Rubin usually has the golden touch - from the Beastie Boys to the Dixie Chicks, to Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond. But this CD has so many sugar coated power ballads you'd think you just bought a Nickelback CD.There are a few rockers but not enough to offset the bad.Bad Rick Rubin. Bad."
1,One listenable song,"Like most fans, Linkin Park won me over with Hybrid Theory. There was a good balance between metal, rap, and other styles. This album tries to become more mainstream. They really lean away from the metal sound that made the band. The only song that I could listen to all the way through was 'What I've Done"". There was either too much rap in every song, and I was waiting for Chester to come in with a heavy chorus, or the song was a ballad. It was disappointing to say the least. As a fan of Hybrid Theory, this isn't the Linkin Park that I became a fan of."
2,LP's Latest falls short of (my) expectations,Linkin Park's latest album is too much of a departure from previous albums. They've gotten soft and moved to far away from what brought them to the dance. Very disapointed as this is one of my three favorite bands that up until this time have always delivered. Maybe next time.-Mark
2,"Passable rock, but crummy Linkin Park","Take a generous helping of Nickelback, mix in some Korn, and a hint of Limp Bizkit and you'll have Linkin Park's new sound for this album. Bleah. Ironic that a band that shaped the sound of a genre is now impotently emulating others.Thank God for the net and mp3's or I would have bought this upon release just like the bad old pre-napster days. The record companies got me with Def Leppard's Slang, they won't be getting me with Minutes to Midnight."
2,Everything Rick Rubin Touches Turns to Gold . . . Well . . . Not Quite,"After Rick Rubin produced a Rock Album of the year by taking some of the Funk out of RHCP's Califunk for Stadium Arcadium, he helped Linkin Park take the rock and the rap out of their unique brand of Rap-Rock. It didn't work quite as well, in fact this is a complete dud. My favorite song is Bleed it Out, and this song really rocks. What I've Done has a haunting piano piece like In the End, but is really really repetitive lyrically. Some of the politics that come into the music are usually what I like to hear artists say to express themselves, but for Linkin Park I don't think it works as well. However, I gotta admit Hands Held High is pretty good. I honestly thought that I had put in The Fray CD when I heard the Shadow of the Day intro. Yea, pretty much too soft, too slow."
3,Big Difference,"If you can get past the concept of this being Linkin Park, its an OK album. The CD is ok, its just WAY different than what you'd expect from a Linkin Park CD. If you've heard ""What I've Done"", its one of the heaviest songs on the CD (hard to believe, I know). The change from Meteora to Minutes to Midnight is about the equivalent of Deftones change from Around the Fur to White Pony. Instead of new-age metal with hints of rap and techno, this CD more resembles a smooth jazz band. Decent CD if you're looking for easy listening. Every song could be done with just Chester and a pianist without losing much of its feel."
1,Linkin Park are bunch of HAS BEEN SELLOUTS!!,"wow, linkin park has officially sold out. This pretty boys are nothing but nsync with some guitar playing that only apply to bubble gum teenie boppers. With a pathetic album who's trying to be political, Stinkin park is such a WANNABE RATM which not in a million years they will be even 10% as good as Rage. Linkin park has sold out now, bunch of mainstream no talent insecure band =Linkin park. You can compare Linkin park to groups like milli vanilli, nelson, vanilla ice, new kids on the block, nsync, ect... bunch of no talent crappy band."
1,what the heck????,"just one comment for this album..... this sucks, from begining to end. It's something more melancolic than this???.... ahhh yes, F***g Justin Timberlake"
2,Disappointing,"I wasn't a Linkin Park fan at all when One Step Closer was released as a single. My roommate played Hybrid Theory so much, though, I started to really dig them. When Meteora came out and I heard Faint on the radio, I went out and purchased the album the next day. I listened to it for 6 months straight in my car. I couldn't wait for Minutes to Midnight. Over 4 years went by before it came out, so I expected something amazing. Maybe that's why I hate it. It doesn't hit with me on any level like the other two (especially Meteora) did. It's just way too soft to be called Linkin Park."
3,Minutes to Mediocrity,"This CD was disappointing. there are like two good songs on the whole CD. Definitely not worth the whole price of the album. Minutes to midnight is by far the best track on the disk. I own everything that linkin park has released, including reanimation as well as live in texas. This is by far the worst album."
1,Linkin Park.,"Linkin Park sucks that's all there is to it. Use your brain, if a lame band records an album it's gonna be a lame album!"
1,Its not linkin park anymore,"I absolutely love linkin parks meteora and hybrid theory. But unfortunately, this album isn't very good. It's soft and somewhat calm. Whatever happened to their loud music and angry rap? that's what i loved about linkin park, and now, it's just not them anymore. The only songs I actually like in this album is What I've Done and Given Up."
3,This album is WAY better than their previous typical nu-metal crap,"Not a kid.3.5 starsTheir previous albums are getting pale so quick, on the contrary, this album totally grows on me. Totally. The more I listen to this album, the more I love it.It's emotional and has depressive atmosphere.So far, the only thing on this album that I dislike is the factitious f words.Nice work, guys."
4,"Different, but good","They sell a version with the cuss words cropped out. It's a very different take on the band, but keeping that in mind, pretty well done. I was just disappointed; to my knowledge no previous CD they have put out had cuss words in it. Can Linkin Park no longer portray their musical art and emotion without resorting to cussing? Still, it's solid rock and roll."
4,Great album..... but not as good as meteora,First off i dont know why this album is being bashed. i love the album. its GREAT! sure its a different sound. but not bad different. i was a little dissapointed that shinoda wasnt in this one as much but i still love it. the vocals are great! i listen to this album all the time. its not as good as meteora but i like it better than hybrid theory. and hybrid theory was a great album too. linkin park is a great band and i dont think they can make a bad album. but i do miss the anger of the previous two albums. id give it 4 1/2 stars.
1,Third Time NOT a Charm!!!!!,"All I can say is WTF??? How could these guys actually think about releasing this stuff. It is awful! Every song is dull, slow and boring, with the exception of the tracks, ""What I've Done,"" and ""Given Up."" If they would've stuck to the formula of those 2 songs and of there last two albums, which are full of hard driving rockers and crunching guitar, then they would have a winner on there hands. But no, this album is a BIG FAT LOSER!!!! If you want to listen to some music that will put you to sleep, this is the album for you! But if you want to hear some good rocking tunes, look to there previous albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora. You won't find it here. This is probably the worst rock album of 2007."
2,"Not original, NOT the LP that we knew....","The cutting edge heavy hybrid rock sound that uniquely defined Linkin Park only exists in a few songs such as ""What I've Done"" and ""No More Sorrow"". Most of the other songs are a re-hash of a more familiar rock style that is neither original nor cutting edge. The pace of the songs is slower, monotonous and disconnected compared to their previous albums.No matter what your political slant is the political preaching in this album's songs is disappointing, boring and unoriginal. Those types of songs should be left to Green Day, The Dixie Chicks and aging hippie folk music groups.I agree with many of the disappointed fans who felt that LP has essentially tried to re-invent itself with ""Minutes to Midnight"" by embracing more common musical themes, styles and lyrics. I found that the more I listened to this album the less I liked it which is contrary to what I felt about their previous albums."
2,Major Disappointment,"It is sad to say but Linkin Park had taken a huge step backward with this one. So much so, that it was a stretch for me to give it 2 stars. The uninspiring melodies, political themes, and multiple f-bombs are not what I expected from the band that I had considered as musical genius' after their first two offerings. Hybrid Theory and Meteora are still tops on my list of great albums, but Minutes to Midnight is painfully forgettable."
2,what happened?,"only like 3 good songs, the rest are too slow and suck! What happened linkin park? I miss screaming shut up at the top of my lungs, now I'm crying while listening to them."
2,I hope there's a Reanimation project in the making,"When reading the booklet they said it took them twice as long as the first two albums. That's the problem, too much thinking went into it. Also, I was extremely surprised that it was executive produced by Rick Rubin, did he finally dropped the ball and lost his Midas touch?"
2,hate ittt,i LOVE LP but hateeeeeee this album...it doesnt even sound like them! I had to relook at make sure i bought the right CD! the lyrics are so emo and whoever wrote them is highly disturbed. overall NOT impressed!!!!
5,AMAZING BEYOND BELIEF,I have been always loved linkin park and i believe that this cd was not one of there BEST but it was up there in the rankings. It really did not suck as much as everyone says it does. In the Cd you hear the same Linkin Park with a little more of a variety. Linkin park succeeds in appealing to multiple genres and their fans.LUV IT10 out of 5 stars
2,Not what I expected,"I've listened to Linkin Park for years, I absolutely loved Meteora, Hybrid Theory and all their other albums and was eagerly waiting for this one to come out, so I bought it but I already regret buying it. I completely waisted my money on this. It had songs which had absolutely no rock or good lyrics. Why'd they go all soft all of a sudden? Even their lyric have become softer. Singing about valentines day, apologizing to someone are what they sing about now. If this CD is not compared to LPs last CDs it would've been better. P/S I only rated this 2/5 because of around, say, 2 songs I liked and 2 songs that were ok. But on ALL the other LP CDs I loved ALL the songs."
4,A more mature Linkin Park,"I was a huge fan of Hybrid Theory as it got me into Linkin Park even remember my brother buying an advance copy at a record store before it hit local stores! I liked Meteroa and Reanimation but when I heard Minutes to Midnight I was amazed/shocked by how LP have changed alot. For those who want to old Linkin Park go back and listen to their first album but for those who want a more mature Linkin Park then get this album. I was disappointed by a few tracks other than the single ""What I Done"" as LP like to throw the F word alot in a few tracks and thats not really needed. You either hate this album or love it but hopefully Linkin Park will continue to evolve but this album just feels like it was rushed or overproduced too much like they wanted to get radio airplay which ain't bad cause you need singles to sell your album and make videos for them."
1,Someone jumped the shark!,"And they did it with Rick Rubin. For some reason the guys in the band thought they were NU METAL and actually said they ""created that genre"" and wanted to stay far away from it.. Obviously their delusional and aren't even close to NU METAL because KORN created that genre.. Anyways track by track shows immaturity and obvious theft of other artists writings.. Specificly U2 ""With Or Without You"" and ""Shadow Of The Day"". These guys need to regroup and stop jumping the gun and write some good songs and feel good doing it. Dont worry about what people think. Take a year off and write this CD off as a learning moment. Let's a see a double album next time and stop ripping your fans off."
1,what is this bologna...,dont waste your time.. i can listen to hybrid theory and meteora all day. I cant even get passed 5 songs without having to change the CD. Terrible.. just terrible.. mr. hahn and mike shinoda aren't even present... Almost seems like when they had the interview with them on MTV the other day. Just Chesters and Phoenix's ideas as they were saying what they wanted to express.. They pretty much sold out to the likes of Rick Rubin who totally messed up this cd and added his political thoughts just like in American Idiot cd. Rick Rubin is a turd.. this is not linkin park.
4,Better than I expected,"After being a fan since near the beginnning, buying all their cds (even the not so good remixes, and going to see them on the family values tour, I was patiently waiting the last 3-4 years for an album. With that much time in between it should be d!@n good. It was better than I thought, even though the only local cd store rips you off for $17 when you can buy it here for $10. I dont like #5, 9, and 10, the mellow ballad type songs even though I did love my december. I watched them on SNL last week and wasn't impressed, especially with bleed it out. It was too repeatative. Shinoda was pretty absent."
1,LP go bad,This is without a doubt one of the worst albums I've ever bought. I love LP but this really is a turn towards what to expect in the future.Why do bands like LP think that just because they are a big successful act they can experiment & pull off a miracle? It didn't work for Audioslave or Metallica.Save your money people & buy music from real artists like Iron Maiden who've been around & know how to actually write good music!
1,it..it..it sucks...,"Hybrid Theory 3/5Meteora 5/5Minutes To Midnight 0/5Let's see...I guess this is what happens when you get too famous; you lose your freakin' mind. I can hear the band thinking right now ""you know what, people will buy anything now that we're famous so I guess we don't even have to TRY anymore!!! Well in point of fact, they're right. I know this won't outsell Meteora, but it probably will put them well on their way to making what could in all probability only be another garbage album. In any case, progress usually is a good thing, but perhaps Meteora 2 would be the best bet for Linkin' Park. And just a side thought, am I the only one who thinks Chester went from a semi-normal looking person to looking like an absolute douchebag? Seen the video? Yeah, I thought so."
5,Linkin Park's Best Work to Date!!!,"IMHO, Linkin Park has matured into one of the most talented and vital bands of this era. I've listened to this CD about 15 times now and it gets better with each turn. I feel this band lives in the present and they are very accurate with their feelings toward today's main issues... money, greed, and war. Hybrid Theory and Meteora were excellent for their time, this CD follows that legacy, but at a higher level! Enjoy, listen closely, and don't fall into the trap of thinking that this should sound like the past."
4,"good, but could be [ a lot ] better","I downloaded this new album, Minutes to Midnight by Linkin Park and a I have to say that it is somewhat of a disappointment, especially considering how good Hybrid Theory and Meteora were. Here are some pros and consPros1. some song are like older albums, similar sound2. chester still sounds great3. most of the lyrics are very in depth and excellent4. like brad delson's haistyle :)Cons1. need more of Mike Shinoda2. Some songs are way too soft for Linkin Park3. overuse of clapping in some songsEven though that this is a good album overall and the guys at LP put a lot of effort into it but I think that they ""changed the sound of the band"" a little in the wrong direction. This album is definately not as good as the previous 2."
1,Big Disapointment!,"I have been a big fan of Linkin Park and absolutely loved their first two albums. Minutes to Midnight has a completely new style to it that does not sound like band. Overall it is much more mellow than the rest of their material and I only really enjoyed 3 of the 12 songs. Even then, nothing really blew me away with this album unlike with Hybrid Theory and Meteora."
1,Can you say 'selling out'?,"What the heck happened to their music? I was a big fan but this new album is stupidly political and is just plain horrible. Their single on the album is the only mildly LP style song on the album. LP obviously went soft and pop. LINKIN PARK, SOME ADVICE: GO BACK TO THE WAY YOU USED TO MAKE YOUR MUSIC, THAT'S HOW YOU ATTRACTED YOUR FANS SO YOU WOULD BE WISE TO STICK TO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Is this Hoobastank in disguise?,"Half the songs on the cd sound Hoobastank'ish.If I wanted Hoobastank, I would have purchased a Hoobastank cd.Its just too bad we had to wait 4 years for this rip off."
1,What have the done to themselves?,"If I could I would give this album no stars. This was a major let down as I was looking forward to this album for so long. The songs are just such a bland and boring departure. I am all for a band trying new things, but be sensible about it. Maybe only do this kind of departure or 2 or 3 songs and then do your standard stuff. I should have known this album would have been pretty bad just by the simple fact Rick Rubin produced it. He has a thing for taking well established bands and making them do sub-par albums. I've tried listening to this album several times through to give it a fair shot, and there are some songs that hand great potential, but didn't quite make the grade. I have a feeling this album is going to alienate a lot of standard LP fans. At least I will still have their tour to look forward to."
2,Minutes to Midnight...,"Minutes to Midnight...Should be more like Minutes Till I Slash my wrists, or maybe Minutes Till I Jump Off a Bridge. Very big disappointment on Linkin Parks part. With the exception of 3 to 4 songs you might as well take the CD and use it as a coaster when you swallow 40 pills and take a swig of JD. I have been a huge fan of Linkin Park since day 1 and all I have to say is congratulations Linkin Park you have now joined the Emo race. Put on your girl pants and run to the nearest store to pick up this amazing album. Lets just hope that this is all a big joke and Linkin Park will grace us with their presence at a later date."
4,"The long awaited non-remix ""Junior Class"" album","We all waited a long 3 years for the follow up album to Meteora. While this album knocks it out of its album sleeve it still does not sit next to their freshman album Hybrid Theory that brought the Linkin Park genre main stream.The first few tracks are very hardcore to the average LP listener, but as the album goes on we find the sound that made us fall in love with LP from the start. The melodic sounds of Shinoda rapping and Chester screaming really bring you back to the first album a la Crawling and In The End.The album ends on a sad note. I wish they were able to end it on a classic style LP style song but alas this can not be.In conclusion, I am happy overall with the outcome of their new non-remix album. This should keep us busy for the next couple of years.Thanks Linkin Park!4 Stars!"
2,i sware i bought the wrong cd...,"4 good songs, suprisingly sounding like their old stuffthe rapping has nothing to it like the old albums and they became big for what they do (did)and that was absolutely brilliant rap metalnot some crappy bollocks playing with a keyboard and singing depressing meaningless songs"
4,a welcome change,"I was a huge fan of their first album, Hybrid theory, because it was something different than the norm, then the band began to blend with other artists in the rap rock genre. I believe that this was the only direction they could have gone. The album as a whole did not break any real ground, no new bonds will be formed, but I do think that it is worth giving a listen. Some tracks are harder than others, but ballads are predominate on this disc, the rap rock thing has all been hung out to dry. However when they do use it on this disc it is worth it and amazing. Songs like ""Bleed it Out: and ""Hold Nothing Back"" are worth the money alone."
2,Who is this again?,"All I can say from is after every track, I would say to myself ""This CAN'T be Linkin Park"". Slow melodies were all over the track with a sound that showed no signs of speeding up. The vocals have changed alot too. This CD is like they took a whole new direction and I don't know if it's a good direction yet. I have to listen to it a little more and hope it grows on me. I fyou plan on buying this CD because you love Linkin Park's music, then I suggest you listen to a few samples before a blind purchase."
2,WHERE IS THE RAPPER GUY?,"I hate rap music. However, there was something good about the rap/heavy guitar/voices combination found in previous albums. Count me out if the whole album is like ""What I've done"""
3,this is not the linkin park we all know and love and thats not a good thing.,"for those of you who liked hybrid theory and meteora do not waste your money. this album is nothing like the previous releases. chester has lost his edge singing more ballads than anything else. mike shinoda's voice is barely even heard as he only raps on 2 songs and they are not the rap rock crossbreeds that we all liked so much. they resemble the weaker songs from the fort minor album. now if you did not like the first 2 albums and you like rock ballads than by all means go purchase this cd. as far as my 3 star rating goes, as a linkin park fan i give it 1 star. as a music fan i give it 3 stars. its not a bad album. its just not linkin park. for some, change is good. for linkin park change is definitely not good. hopefully on their next release they will remember what made them famous and return to it because now instead of being standouts in the music world, they just kind of blend in."
2,change is good... well... maybe...,"I remember a comment from the Meteora DVD, about how they wanted each song to be enjoyed even by the 100th time... it seems that concern was not present on this album. Yes, they changed... but there's nothing special."
2,This is not what I was waiting for...,"I was waiting so eagerly for this LP album. I am a hardcore LP fan but they just let me down. What a piece of junk. Except for what I have done and Bleed it Out, none of the songs are even worth a hear. The two songs I mentioned are also okay. I am only let down by this album. I hope this is some kind of joke cause I expected a zillion times better then this. I hope they get the old Mike and Chester Rap-Rock back in the same album. Please for god-sakes."
1,Embarrassing,"This record is a turd...don't waste your $. I'm almost embarrassed to be a fan. Good thing I can still spin Hybrid or Meteora if I want a good kick in the balls. If you like your Linkin Park sissified, this is for you."
1,Awful... Just awful...,"I was very excited when I found out that Linkin Park was releasing a new album and ordered it immediately. I was not happy with this album at all. The music was far from what you would expect from Linkin Park and, as with so many other wealthy entertainers, they feel that it is their responsibility to talk about politics in their music. I listen to music for entertainment, not their political wisdom. This was somewhat more palatable in Green Day's American Idiot because the music was still very good. This is not the case in Minutes to Midnight."
2,Ugghhh...,"Like others, I am a huge Linkin Park fan. However, I must say this album is at BEST two stars. Those that rate this four and five stars are simply crazy. There are maybe 3 or 4 good songs, none great. Way too many ballads, not enough edge and where's Mike?Uggghhh....."
3,"Time to Hit the State Fair Circuit, Guys","The best tracks--""Bleed It Out"" and ""What I've Done""--sound like they could have been b-sides from earlier Linkin Park efforts. That's not a bad thing, just not a great thing. The rest of the album reflects the band's newfound ""maturity."" The most egregious example is the closing track, ""The Little Things Give You Away."" Conceived as a tribute to Katrina victims, it comes off as a whincingly trite Anderson Cooper monologue set to music: ""Like an ocean/Everywhere...The levees are breaking...As a nation simply stares."" Thanks for the newsflash, guys! I think I missed that one.All I can say is this: Steely Dan is mature. Interpret as you will."
4,"Good Music, but not Linkin Park","Tracks 2, 4, 6, and 8 stay true to what made Linkin Park famous in the first place. The rest of it just sounds like any other emo song out there. Hands Held High has its moments, but I was thoroughly disappointed in the lack of Mike Shinoda's rapping in the majority of the CD. After Fort Minor, I expected something more from him. Given Up can only be defined as intense, especially with the 30 second + yell. Totally kickass. Like I said, if I heard a lot of the songs on the radio, I would think they sounded pretty good, but not Linkin Park."
3,Fort Minor,"I guess to be fair, I will give it a couple more spins. It just reminds me of a Fort Minor project, than a Linkin Park project. I recall a couple of tracks on here that were more in the style of Linkin Park."
3,Sometimes change is not a good thing,"I, like most people here loved Linkin Park's flawless blend of rap-rock and normally I'm not a fan of rap or the mixing of it into other music. Hybrid Theory and Meteora changed my mind and were excellent albums but Minutes to Midnight is missing that rap-rock mix and the uniqueness of dueling voices we all enjoyed in Chester and Mike. Those two things set them apart and without it, they sound much like Trapt. This may very well be one of those ""grow on you"" albums but by changing their sound all they did was become more mainstream."
2,if you get mad at my reveiw oh well.,i'm just gonna come out and say this cd sucks .. flat out this is a load of crap i dont see how rick rubin could have produced this cd that other guy was right were a 7 year old band whos only done 3 cds cause we try to fit in with every style of music that is sellingnow. these guys are tryin to just fit in with what others are doing oh!!!!!!! i can cuss now im cool oh yea heres a good one to lets be another band doi ng a anti bush song yea like we havent heard that before !! no other band has ever written a song about our president. gimme a break this cd sucks but if you must go waste 14 bucks .
2,what is this crap?,"i could not believe my ears when i put the cd in yesterday. nothing even close to what i was expecting from LP. total letdown imo. only 3 maybe 4 good rock songs on here and the rest sounds like lullabyes he is trying to sing his kid for bedtime. if you are a diehard LP fan and expecting something close to hybrid theory, you are going to be in shock."
4,"""I bleed it out digging deeper just to throw it away, just to throw it away...""","Linkin Park's new album, Minutes to Midnight is somewhat a drastic change from their previous two. Of course Hybrid Theory is their best disc but this particular album isn't a total wash-out. The reason I gave Minutes to Midnight four stars is because the band tried something new, which I always appreciate, the songs are softer but still have a rock edge to it, and Chester Bennington's vocals have never sounded more clearer and animated (in a good way). Standout tracks include: Bleed it Out, Shadow of the Day, Hands Held High, In Between, and Leave Out All the Rest. Expect to hear a different sound but ultimately it will leave you wanting more (if you like change that is). Happy listening!"
1,I HATE IT,"Worst Link Park album I've ever heard, ever. Do not buy this CD if yo uare a fan of 'old school' Linkin Park."
1,Seconds2Mediocrity,"ABSOLUTELY HATE IT!!!! I loved Linkin Park's earlier brilliant and highly influential work, but this CD is a HUGE disappointment!!! These have to be the reject songs that didn't make it onto the first two CDs. As far as I am concerned, LP is dead and another band is doing a terrible impersonation. All the genius is gone. Any band could have put this slop together."
4,Great Album,"I love LP, and loved the single of this album, What I've done. It's not like anything else of theirs, it doesn't have as much rap/rock combinations that they normally do. I love this cd, its not what you would expect but they did push themselves to the limit on this one and it worked, Rick Rubin and Mike did a great job producing this album. If your a LP fan, get it you will not regret your purchase,if your not an LP fan still get it, the lyrics and music tie so well that you will find yourself dancing, singing along and doing a little hangbanging along with the music. The only thing that could have made this album a little better would have been maybe one or two songs with the beats, rap and vocals, (i.e. In the end, numb)."
3,Not Your Typical Linkin Park...,"But not a horrible CD. Unfortunately, it didn't feel like Linkin Park. The previous albums were a sound that I couldn't place to any other group, but this CD seems to be a rehashing of the new emo/punk/political type of music. Most of the songs on this CD I can see coming out on the pop radio stations sometime, and very few of them on any rock station. The lyrics for the most part are boring and simple, as with the drums and melodies in general. There's little of the electronic feel that LP has shown in the past, which is a huge downer for major LP fans. If you don't think of this as LP, you might like it, but if you're looking for that amazing album that they have been talking about making for the last 5 years, this isn't it. One of the songs I can even say is Fort Minor, not LP. Good CD, just shouldn't be labeled as Linkin Park."
1,Speechless...that's how I feel,Not much to say. Change is good but this is not. This is basically a whole new band that I'm NOT interested in and I've followed them from the beginning. Oh well.
2,"Backstreet Boys, U2, or Linkin Park?","I cannot believe what has happened to Linkin Park. I'm not sure if...well I have no words to describe how I feel about this alblum. It started out good. Nice little intro, first song pretty decent. Then they turn into U2. My wife even said one song reminded her of backstreet boys. I read that somebody said that if you don't like this album you are a sell out. Well I'm sorry to say that LP has sold out. How can you completely change your style from nu-metal to emo? I HATE emo and that is exactly what this cd reminds me of. Tracks 2,4 and 8 are quality LP songs but the rest are good but not what you would want from linkin park. If I wanted to listen to those type of songs I would buy a U2 cd. LP became popular because of their unique style of music and they have totally abandoned that. I guess they want new fans because they lost this one."
2,Disappointing,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this CD was not the typical Linkin Park style. When I read an interview that stated more effort went into this album than any other before, I wondered where all of that energy went. Over 100 demo songs were produced before coming up with the final tract list. Much of the CD is filled with anti-Bush and anti-war rhetoric. While I have no problem with adding political discourse to music, many of the songs come across as a repeat of what Green Day accomplished several years ago."
1,No suprise,"Rick Rubin producing you say? Quite a few months in the writing process eh? Maybe this album will be worth listening to, haha, wrong! Since I was a freshmen in high school when ""Hybrid Theory"" came out I was ofcourse listening to this band. The over-produced, pro-tool using nu metal pop band did grab your attention if you had the mindset of a 15 year old such as I. Fast foward to nearly seven years later and this band is huge, I remember seeing these guy's play with Kottonmouth Kings and Hed PE at the nearest dump of a club this city could offer. The band seems lazy, rich and bored and not worth giving actual musical writing a chance. I'm alone on Valentine's Day? I'm sorry Chester, hopefully next time around a woman will except your chocolate and flowers. Give me a break, I hate insulting bands and what not but this album is so bland and boring, Rick Rubin's touch seems nowhere to be found."
1,I miss Linkin Park,"I don't know who made this cd and is calling them self Linkin Park, but it isn't the real LP. I have listened to them since Hybrid Theory and loved every song from both that cd and Meteora. This has only a select few songs that are only even ok. I hope when they come out with another cd it is like their old stuff. Otherwise music will go down the crapper. LP is my only hope..."
1,Umm yaaaa NO!,"If you like whining chick rock, like the new Staind and Daughtry, you'll love this album. If you like Linkin Park, don't pick up this Linkin Park CD (odd sounding eh?). WTF LP! My only hope for your 4th CD is that the song ""New Divide"" is the LP I've grown to love. If you're headed back in that ""rock"" direction let me know, otherwise I'm done with you."
2,Only a crumb of Linkin Park,"If you like, Hibrid Theory & Meteora, don't buy this cd. Your opinion about Linkin probably change a lot. It's the worst material of them.Much pop, much la la la, cero rock (the really rock). Linkin i'd like but the fussion of hard rock and samples, techno, etc. But the escent always did rock, fast music and good loud music, but this cd (snif, snif!) it's a really shame. ""Please Linkin!!! tell me that the ""martha steward"" version of your cd and soon appear the really linkin cd!!!!"""
1,Linkin Park CD Minutes to Midnight,Being an avid Linkin Park fan I really didn't like this CD. A completely different sound than what I'm used to listening to.
1,This is NOT Linkin Park! what in the world happened?,"If you loved Hybrid Theory, Reanimation and Meteora, this Album will leave you wondering why in the world did they change their awesome ways! They say in the Album that they wrote this Album for themselves and when you are an artist you do your album for YOUR FANS! This is garbage! Do not buy this, nothing stands out nothing. Im very let down by this."
3,This CD is okay But...,I walked into Circuit city today all happy to get the new Linkin Park CD. After doing so I put it straight in my CD player and listen to it straight through. I am sorry to say I am disappointed. I mean the CD is okay but not as hard hitting and or addicting CD as the other two in which I love. The CD is worth listening too but not as good as you thought it would be. My advice is wait awhile and buy it used when the price goes down on Amazon used and new!!
1,oh my god this is terrible,what a terrible thing to do to all the lp fans...we've waited so long for a new album and this is what we get..This album is soooo slow and very tough to listen to...i would not reccomend getting this one i seriously wanted to throw this cd out the window as i was driving
1,"Why do bands ""grow"" and inevitably get worse?","All of LP's previous stuff has been exemplary, including even the Jay Z mix and the 4 fan-special volumes.This album from another group might get 2-3 stars but from LP gets one because it's an atrocity to their name. I would have called LP my favorite group, but this is just really bland and boring and to have waited so many years...what a shame.Too bad, their reign was for a long time, but it seems every group has to fall from grace at some point. Let us just say a solemn prayer for the late LP and remember them when they were good and not destined for the closing credits on a teenage drama."
1,WHERE DID LINKIN PARK GO!!!,"Give me back the old Linkin Park!! There are numerous problems on this disc. 1. A while back Chetser said ""vulgarity doesn't ever add anything special"", ...suuure... 2. There's practically no rapping on this cd.(except Hands Held High and Bleed It Out) 3. Ballads are OK, but over half the songs are all ballads. These guys used to an amazingly aggressive Rap/Rock band, now they're a wimpy Pop/Rock group. AVOID THIS ALBUM!!!!!!"
2,What happened?,"After spending the time to listen to the whole CD, I've never been sooooo disappointed! Other than the lead vocal's voice, it doesn't sound like Linkin Park. I hope on the next one (if this doesn't bury them) goes back to the old Linkin Park sound (the one that made them great)."
2,Regretably Boring Release,"This album is a definite divergence from previous Linkin Park releases, and though it is similar in composition and general approach it nevertheless falls short in almost all respects. What really ruins this album is that nothing seems to fit - slow repetitive music is combined with uninteresting lyrics; fast and uniquely Linkin Park beats are combined with overly repetitive lyrics which are unimaginative and not engaging.The overall CD comes across as a poorly planned and eclectic collection - it's important to branch out and try new things, and Linkin Park should be commended for not trying to hole up in a mode established in Meteora and Hybrid Theory. At the same time, it is important not to disregard the things which worked well for this group of musicians and the fans which enjoyed such releases. Minutes to Midnight will probably disappoint any but the staunchest adherents of Linkin Park's new album of teenage-angst, punk, hip-hop, synth mix."
4,More mellow but still pretty good.,"This is at all what I expected and I didn't like it at first but the more I listen to it the more I like it. I'm a big fan of the songs ""Bleed it Out"" and ""Hands Held High""."
3,Disappointment,"I've listened to LP off and on for the last seven years, but it was only recently that I began to really like the band. I absolutely love every song on Hybrid Theory and Meteora, so I was very excited for the release of Minutes to Midnight. ""What I've Done"" is a fantastic song. I had high hopes for the album after hearing it on the radio and seeing the video on television.Unfortunately, those hopes were unfounded. Having listened to the CD after purchasing it yesterday, I find myself very disappointed. The songs are far too slow. Linkin Park is supposed to be FAST. And where's Mike's rapping along with Chester's vocals? Instead of pairing them up, the band has split them into separate songs. And the song with the ""amen"" is terrible.A huge let down. 3 out of 5 stars."
2,"Weak, Weak, Weak","To quote my friend ""G"", ""This is WEAK SAUCE"". This is their worst album, it just has nothing. Ok, yes there is two maybe three songs that are good, but the rest of the album is ""WEAK SAUCE"". I mean the other two albums had a great jams by Mr. Hahn, and this album needs it! I do like ""Bleed It Out"", ""What I've Done"", and ""In Pieces"" they are best tracks on a Weak album. I don't understand what happened, on ""Hybrid Theory"" and ""Meteora"" their is not a bad track on those albums, both albums rock from start to finish. This album puts you to sleep with the opening track.This album is ""WEAK SAUCE"""
1,Huge Let Down,"Steer clear of this album if your an LP fan. Stick with the 4 previous albums, because this album is a complete waste of money. Now lets just hope their concerts are the same."
3,come on now!,"first off this is not where im at in music right know but that doesnt mean that it sucks. I just listen to this cd three times in a row. I read online that this album was way softer than anything they have done as a whole, but i like my december and that song is old as hell like before hybrid theory came out. And for all those who judge so quickly maybe you arent as big of a fan of this band than you thought, no big deal becuase i not the biggest by far but they do have good cds and they rock live, and the live show to me makes all the difference. Its sad to say but there will be a lot of people who buy this cd just because its LP and not because they like it. I give it 3.5 right know could change later."
3,Skeptical Fan,"I'm a fan of all rock, everything from alternative, to hard rock to just a little bit of pop rock, and From what i've heard so far, this album will either be a bust, or be popular, cause Mike Sings more than raps, which was a big part in their old great stuff.Minutes to Midnight will not be popular with true Linkin Park fans who loved Hybrid Theory and Meteora, so Linkin Park will lose a portion of their fans, so they will have to depend on a new fan base.I'll give this album a shot, but if I don't like it, they will lose this fan."
2,A statement for our times?... don't think so,"I considered myself a fan, but after giving this collection of songs a thorough listening, I came away with the feeling that the band attempts to substitute their personal political viewpoints for music. I, for one, don't buy it. Even though a few tunes rise to their former level of energy, the remainder of these songs run out of gas before the tracks end. Let's not allow today's corporate music juggernaut to say what's quality,... this LP outing is only fair at best. If you want to get on your soapbox guys, CNN & Time magazine would be happy to give you an interview. But as for music?... just return to the drawing board & do what you seem to do best."
5,Right on,"To Joe:Good catch, also some of the songs are from Chester's old band ""Grey Daze."" (See my previous review) I, too, am tired of all this claiming to of heard the new album knowing that they are all listening to the fake.Wait until the album comes out."
1,Did Weird Al get ahold of this album?,"... because it isn't funny. I haven't bought the album yet, but I don't intend to based on the Amazon clips. I want my hard and heavy rockers back, not these EMO imposters.There are only 2 songs worth having on this album, in my opinion. What I've Done is such a teaser as the only identifiably Linkin Park song on the disk. It makes me want to go dig out Hybrid Theory and Meteora and reminisce. The other song worth having is Shadow Of The Day. I heard this song on the radio and loved it, even though at the time I had no clue it was LP. Needless to say, I was shocked when I realized that's who it was because it's completely EMO and not at all what I expected."
3,Disappointing,"Too many ballads. Sorry LP, I love you guys but I'm not a fan of this album.I'll give you credit for trying something new."
3,Minutes to Midnight - disappointing,"Listened to Minutes to Midnight yesterday and was disappointed. A few tracks were great, especially What I've Done, which sounds like the old LP. Can't compare to previous CDs."
2,What did you guys do?!,"LP is one of my favorite bands! It is difficult to find a band that rocks and does not cater to bubble gum school kids. LP has shown that they can be very innovative with their music and I think Meteora epitomized that notion. The first and second albums were some of the best modern rock that I have heard! I guess every good thing must come to an end... I understand that bands want to evolve and grow as musicians, but LP does not need to do it this way! Do not ever, ever, ever, ever, ever go soft LP. I listened to a friends CD and will not be buying this. I think this band needs to step back and evaluate what made them great. Buyer beware, LP has gone soft and has decided to sell out. LP, the next CD had better be harder than ever before because this thing stinks!"
3,"First real NWA album, get it if ya love em","I would definatly not consider this a classic.Good track's are b-Ball, Boyz-N-Tha hood,Bitch IZ a Bitch and Dope Man, even though the first two are edited version's.All the rest of the song's are crap, and that is baisically the low-down.Tight album art, actually I think the best of any NWA album, even stright outta compton.One thing I don't understand is how Arabian prince, and the whole Fila Fresh Crew, besides D.O.C. ever became rapper's cause they suck monkey balls bad, and almost ruin this would be classic album, so you have those fag's to blame for me giving this a 3.5If you buy this listen to the song's, I said, and you will like it, but I think you should listen to drink it up, and Fat Girl just once to relize how the retarded parts of this album outweigh the cool part's, qhich there is some really cool part's."
3,Not as bad as what followed,"Personally, I blame NWA's ""Straight Ouuta Compton"" for ruining rap music and misleading a generation. But this earlier effort ain't as bad. With songs like ""Drink It Up"", ""Fat Girl,"" and the original ""Boyz In The Hood,"" this is filled with junior high humor a'la 2 Live Crew and is more amusing and harmless than the horrible garbage that followed. However, A B--- Is A B---"" is an ugly warning of what was to come. These clowns still, in spite of this comparatively innocous early effort, bear the responsibility of beginning rap's downhill spiral into misogyny and violence."
3,"not bad at all, but be prepared for a surprised","For those who are already mad because i only gave this one a 3 of 5, listen. i consider a 3 to be slightly above average, which is basically how i consider this album. if you havent heard straight outta compton or any other nwa album do yourself a favour and hear this 1st because this is where it started. I personnally can't listen to this one for too long because the album was recorded on very little money, the tracks arent exactly polished and the quality is a pretty rough, (there is a remastered version now available apparently however). Not a bad release at all in my eyes but to appreciate it you gotta be a fan of nwa or old school gangsta rap."
4,N.W.A. and The Posse,"For all you old school hardcore rap lovers, this is the C.D. for you. When this C.D. released in 1989, it had no parallel, and still has no parallel today. Never has the world seen such a collection of rap musicians at the beginings of their soon-to-be successful careers. I recommend it to all who love the early years of rap in its purest form, HARDCORE!!! If you like this C.D., I also recommend the early years of Public Enemy."
2,NWA And The Posse,"Anyone who isn't familiar with this particular record might be surprised with what they hear. Much of the record has a disco-dance feel to it and it rarely uses the hard gangsta beats that would later make the group famous. There are really only 4 tracks worth your time and three of them are featured in remixes on better NWA albums (Boyz N The Hood on ""Eazy-Duz It"", 8-Ball and Dopeman on ""Straight Outta Compton."") Unless you are a collector and need all of NWA's material, avoid this particular album."
3,High ISO is not good,I bought this one in gray market. the picture quality is not good as D300. review screen is small.
2,WHY,"Why on earth would anyone spend 4k on this when you could spend the SAME 4k and get D3.....which is superior in EVERY way?????? Please tell me? If you have 4k and are in the market for DSL, get the D3."
4,Megapixels don't matter.,"As an enthusiast, i was really impressed with the image & build quality of the D7000. I still own this camera & still love to use it for indoor work, low light performance is still impressive.The D2XS was a choice for it's speed of handling, although the megapixel count is now ancient, the image quality is truly a beautiful thing & only shooting with it can relay it's images on a personal choice level.The build quality, function structure, performance, focus speed, battery life, viewfinder are all reason enough to pick up this machine & enjoy photography.For the used price of around $1000 (with 5K shutter count) i feel lucky to have encountered such a deal.Between the D2XS & D7000, my investment was minimal to continue taking pictures with some decent gear."
5,Great,"Do you want a book which shows how a TRUE top gemstone looks like ? Buy it. Do you want to understand why you cannot buy a really! pigeon blood red ruby for 100 dollars a carat? Buy it. You cannot decide if the paraiba tourmaline, advertised on an internet auction for 135 dollars, may be a good business? Buy it"
3,Gemstone Buying Guide,"I do not feel this book is specific enough regarding values of stones for a beginner such as myself, especially for less-expensive stones."
2,Pretty but chain doesnt last,my son bought this for his girlfriend for Christmas. It's very pretty but the chain is very frail and didnt last. Ended up having to buy a new chain.
5,Very good,"This book is very well researched, unpretentious and comprehensive. It is a very good starting point for everybody who wants to know about kundalini without jargon and mysticism. There is only one point I want to make. The author seems to almost recommand doing Western breathwork even though many many people have had terrible symptoms doing this. Breathwork can irrepairably damage your chakras and give you 'energy disease' as is it is called in Tibetan Buddhism. In this respect the author lacks discernment and I urgently advise everybody not to do things involving any form of forceful breath."
4,American Gangster,Wow what a movie.Its based on a true story but I'm sure that theres alot of hollywood in it.Anyway wow is about all i can really say.The movie speaks for its self.
4,A big fan,"I am a big Denzel Washington fan. Yes, he's a good actor...but he really knows how to pick his roles. I have yet to see one of his movies I did not like."
4,American Gangster,"The Black Godfather in a manner of speaking. This is based on a true story and it is gritty and great. Good job casting and directing and production is amazing. Sets and costumes will take you from 1960s to 1990s. Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe give stand out performances as a gangster and a clean cop. You will see Denzel's character rise from a driver that respects his boss to an all powerful leader. You will see as he goes from twenty thousand to over two-hundred and fifty million. He brings his large family from South Carolina and sets them all up in the business. Although it may seem a little long in parts it is a good drama. If you enjoy movies like ""The Godfather"" or ""Donnie Brasco"", you will probably enjoy this movie. Good quality DVD with decent replayability."
4,Mr. Untouchable He Is Not,"If you like American Gangster, you will love ""Mr. Untouchable."" It is a real life DOCUMENTARY on Leroy ""Nicky"" Barnes, who was in the same era as Frank Lucas, and did the exact same thing. Barnes owned more of Harlem than Frank did. This movie didn't portray Barnes a whole lot, in my opinion, Barnes was way more ahead than Frank was. The movie was more drama than action, Mr. Untouchable is RAW and has the actual people from Nicky's gang through the entire thing. Rent it, you will not be dissappointed. On another note, I think it's funny how these guys were both big and bad and yet when they get busted, they ratted out everyone."
1,Worst Gangster Movie Ever,"Don't bother with this movie. Watch The Wire and you'll see what great acting, plot and dialogue are all about. This movie features great actors ""at their worst"". I wouldn't have bothered except that I love NYC and wanted to see a quasi-historical movie about the Vietnam era and the destructive effect of the War on Drugs in Manhattan.If they allowed ZERO stars, this movie might be worth a ZERO."
3,lack of action,"I thought this movie had more action scenes like other Gangster movies, but I was wrong. It spends too much time in details that weren't worthy, for instance the trips to Vietnam. If you like action movies, then this one is not for you"
3,A must see for Ridley Scott fans...,"but not for other more casual film goers...I enjoyed the film but do not believe it to be amongst Scott's best works. The acting was fine, direction fine, dialogue OK...but the story tried to encompass too much...a big storyline arc has worked for Scott in other films (Gladiator) but not here...we get to see too little of Frank Lucas's interaction with his family and the Harlem community and we see too little of Crowe's characters interaction with his fellow police officers...in both cases THESE are the most interesting parts of the film...not the chase of Lucas by the drug squad...That said...the last 1/2 hour of the film is EXCELLENT...once the drugs are found in the coffins and the warrant is issued for Lucas's arrest the pace picks up and we get to see the interaction between Washington and Crowe on screen which makes the film worth viewing for that alone..."
4,Russell Crowe carries this film,"Interesting film, and a good expose of a modern crime boss. Denzel is very good as Frank Lucas, and his motivations are well explored. However, Russell Crowe has an amazingly complex role, and handles his material like a super-pro. This took place during the same time frame as Frank Serpico, and good cops had a really tough time. Ridley Scott did a fine job in bringing out the complexities of the narrative and the characters. Period detail, even though it was only in the 60's, was right-on, and it's always nice to see Ruby Dee, if even so briefly. Fine as she always is, I'm sure she won her awards because of who she is; she certainly wasn't challenged in this role (I liked her a lot in the TV version of ""The Stand""). As a history lesson, this is worth a look. Production values are high, and the second DVD disc fills in a lot. Worth seeing..."
3,Boring Movie,"This movie has Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington. I am having a great expectation that this movie is as good asGoodFellas [Blu-ray],American History X [Blu-ray], and evenRoad to Perdition [Blu-ray]. I am hoping that this movie has a great historical significance to the American history. But no. They just talk and talk for 3 hours for how Frank was being hunted down by the good cops. No action. Nothing much to learn about Frank (except that he is very smart) or how it is like to live in the 60's. Russell Crowe is pretty good in this movie but all the rest of the casts including Denzel Washington are boring.One interesting remark they make in the movie is how black people in the 60's can work hard to move up to the ladder even they are criminal. Even the Italian mafia want to see Frank fail. It is a similar remark Gene Hackman makes inMississippi Burning.I haven't seen the extra in the bluray disc yet. The package itself is just a box with one disc in it.Nothing special. 3 stars."
4,"A rough & tough movie...but with ""ganster"" in the title, what can you expect.","We had seen at the theatre but we really like Denzel Washington so we bought the movie to watch in our home.There's more bad language in it than we like, but we deal with it to watch this movie.Recommend to anyone who likes Denzel W. The only thing: he's a bad guy and we didn't like that part of it."
4,Great!,I love this movie will watch a million times! It arrived before the date of arrival with both discs in the package!
3,Really swell,The movie Came earlier than what I expected so I was pleased. How ever one corners of the box was ripped n the box was unable to close at all it looked really bad so I had to tape it up and this isn't the 1st time I get a damaged item
3,American Gangster,Thank you for a timely and good product which was packaged appropriately. This is an enjoyable movie and from an an African American perspective quite interesting.
4,Strong Acting Propels Familiar Crime Saga,"There's little new in director Ridley Scott's ""American Gangster."" However, the emphasis on characterization over violent action is refreshing. Denzel Washington gives a compelling performance as real-life Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, with Russell Crowe equally impressive as New Jersey detective Richie Roberts - the man determined to bring down Lucas' heroin empire. An excellent supporting cast features standout portrayals by Josh Brolin and Oscar-nominated Ruby Dee. Regardless of the predictable outcome, Scott manages to keep the pot boiling for 157 minutes. ""American Gangster"" does not rank with the classic crime epics, but remains a solid achievement."
1,Overhyped,I was told American Gangster was an epic gangster movie in the tradition of the Godfather. Nothing of the kind. Instead it is another cliched and mediocre urban gangsta flick.
3,Good Movie.........but,I must say that Denzel owns every frame of this movie. It was an intense gangster drama and kept me on my seat's edge until the very end where I felt something was missing. Universal has lost tons of revenue by releasing this movie for a nearly dead format. HD DVD returns are phenomenal and you can see how many open box players amazon is selling. This movie is not worth your movie on HD DVD. Get it on standard DVD instead with the extended director's cut. Little extras and a dead format = less sales and losses for the studio.
1,I fell asleep 3 times from bordom.,"It's true! The movie fails on all levels; Slow-paced and devoid of any meaningful continuity, it fails to encourage any concern on the part of the viewer for any of the characters. I hoped they would all die! Russel Crowe, in his inimitable style, mumbles throughout the entire movie with the exception of two lines. The hacked-up plot proves that Ridley Scott enjoys toying with the viewers mind instead of trying to create a comprehensible storyline. Maybe he hopes the viewer will think him to have a superior intellect."
2,Russell Crowe gives an OSCAR PERFORMANCE,"Rusell Crow gives an OSCAR PERFORMANCE. Crowe is spectacular; he salvages the movie. Unfortunately for Crow that particular year the Oscars were not given based on good acting. It was one of those political based years. The movie is worth renting, perhaps on a rainy when you arrive late at the video store."
5,Have been waiting for this on Blu-ray!,This movie is great! The wait was worth it. It took so long for the Blu-ray release but everything about it is top notch!
4,"GOOD BUT, MISSING SOMETHING? 3 1/2 STARS!","I love a great gangster movie! White Heat, Scarface, The Godfather(part 1 & 2), Goodfellas, Casino.....the list goes on and on. 'American Gangster' has a great cast, excellent production, interesting story, but for all it has going for it, the film didn't completely draw me in. It's certainly worth seeing, but I don't see myself watching this movie more than one or two more times......once to see the extended addition. I rate it 3 1/2 stars. Rent it before you buy it."
5,Brilliant Acting,Hats off to the two leads as they did a splendid job of portraying what being a gangster means as well as the challenge it sets before the law. Who is really clean or who is really dirty? Can the dirty ever become clean or how far is the clean from becoming dirty?? Great job!!!
4,Very good but not classic,"This film is quite good, a few scenes that make you go ooooohh, god, please take that out but overall very enjoyable. A should see, not a must see, but a great film if you love the seventies."
3,"RIDLEY SCOTT, OPUS 17","*** 2007. Directed by Ridley Scott. Two nominations for the Oscars and two other for the Golden Globes. The film tells the story of the black NYC mobster who brought, during the Vietnam war, Asian heroin into the U.S.A.. Ridley Scott is no Francis Ford Coppola and no Sergio Leone and AMERICAN GANGSTER is just an average and long movie, without any epic dimension, about the life of a criminal. Already forgotten."
2,American Gangster - Bang - Boring,Wish I had seen the American Gangster on the big screen. I would have asked for my money back - it was boring. My review: slow and predictable - Bang-Boring!
2,American Gangster,"Not up to expectations. We had heard thru friends that it was excellent, but we didn't think so at all, hence only 2 stars from us. Denzel Washington was very good though."
4,"""A must see""",A brilliant script adapted from a true story with stellar performances from both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. This movie is a must have for your dvd collection.
3,dull most of the time,"I didn't find a whole lot to like about this movie to be completely honest. American Gangster had a pace that was only sometimes interesting probably because there wasn't enough action segments to keep me satisfied- just spoken bits that were never really memorable, and every time Russell Crowe spoke in his character role the quality of the storytelling felt like it slipped a little. It's like the movie kept tricking you into thinking it would become more interesting with every new segment but never delivered.I realize most people who've watched American Gangster really respect it, but I can't bring myself to call this film a classic or anything- just barely good enough to keep a story flowing, and nothing more."
3,American Gangster,"Dissappoited. Speaking to softly,picture too dark. I slept through last 30 minutes and don't feel like I missed a thing."
4,Great Movie,"I love this movie and the HD DVD/Standard DVD is a great bargain at Amazon. Once again, Denzel Washington turns in a great perfomance. The film also provides interesting insight into the drug trade during the Vietnam War era. If I had to change anything in the film, it would have been to have less Russell Crowe. His character was not all that interesting, but that could just be because he is not a personal favorite of mine. What did work with the Crowe character was the contrast between him and the Denzel Washington character. It really raised the question of who was ultimately the better man."
3,Big dog,"Bumpy was the gangster in Harlem in Shaft's 1970's black-exploitationfilms. Denzel Washington just isn't a Richard Roundtree: he does a betterOthello than a gangster. The poor honest cop stick is way over done too.This era was a dirty one that hasn't really yet come clean.More or less, you take one dealer down two volunteer in his place and fight over it... I kind of think the sexy Shaft was more honest than thisapology after the fact for a really dirty dog eat dog era in New York."
3,Not as good as Gladiator but better than Hannibal,The movie has some good bar room scenes with Denzel Washington and his gang members who outnumber Russell Crowe's group of cops. Russell Crowe has some good scenes in which he confronts the U.S. army. But the ending is a let down after all the buildup which promised a good conclusion.
3,Nothing special,"I waited the whole movie for the scene in the trailer, where Denzel executes someone and drops the gun as in ""The Godfather"". It wasn't there. We've seen the story before, and better done. A walk thru for talented people."
3,SLOW Movie,"An Ok movie for a Saturday night at home. Denzel has been better. Very slow movie, almost fell asleep a couple of times."
3,Its ok.,"I think for me I went in believing this was going to be more than it was.What it was to me is a long story that had no climax,it was a straight line all through it.No ups and downs just story..."
3,A LIttle Weird,"This product seems to work adequately, but behaves a bit strangely. For example, there is a portion of my screen that I cannot move the application window into. I cannot imagine why. For the price, it was excellent value."
2,Medical Dictionary,I did not like the product. It was an older version and I could get the same information off of the internet. I did not think to verify what version it was.
5,Must Read,"I was fortunate enough to hear about the book Letters Home by Mary Ward from a friend who had just finished reading it twice. I knew that it was a book that I needed to read. Everything that I was told about the book was true.This book took me back to my own memories of the first time my son was deployed to Iraq. Facing my son's second deployment, I once again picked up Letters Home and read it again and again.I hope that everyone in America has the opportunity to read this book to understand what it is like to have a loved one in the military.Once you buy this book you will not be able to put it down!I anxiously wait for more books by this very talented author."
3,Very LIttle Flying Time,"Altough the plane costs only $21.99,(I got mine from Big K Mart) it can only fly for about seven seconds, and the prpeller only runs for about fifteen seconds. The plane's design is pretty good, and without any power, this plane flies just a little better than a paper plane. But because of it's small battery the plane is never going to keep in the air for two minutes.Also it tells you that you have to throw the plane using as much power as you would throwing a coke can, five to seven feet,but actually, you have thow the plane using as much power as you would throwing a coke can 11-13 feet to make it fly a good distance. And one more thing, the propellers crack way too easily, and because it is so light, it can only be flown 3-5 mph winds, or the wind will carry it away and you will never see it again. So overall, it fly but not much as they say it would."
3,Nice music but some songs sound like $h!t,"Contrary to some of the reviews here, the sound quality on some of these selections is terrible. It's a shame because the music is so nice. Consider yourself warned."
1,Not what I expected,"I have purchased Under Armor products in the past and enjoyed them. However, I was completely dissatisfied with this product. The only thing I like about it is the length of the capri pants. The waist line is too short, and the fabric is flemsy and not what I expected. I would have returned the product, but unfortunately, I threw the receipt and packaging away before I had an opportunity to try the product on. $31.00 plus dollars wasted!"
1,A great book turned into a waste of paper,"An earlier version of this book, was my favorite, most referenced Oracle DBA book. I purchased the new edition without a thought.. unfortunately. Book has minimal revision to allow it to be republished, with all the out dated stuff left in. Any other Oracle 9i book will be a better purchase."
4,The Journey,"It wasn't anything I expected, which was a pleasant surprise. I used to read alot of love stories, but have gotten away from them in the last 6 or 7 years. I now enjoy mysteries, so I enjoyed the fact that it had this and more. There was a little bit of everything in it, including some history lessons. Learning something you didn't know about our world history is always a good thing. It's even better when you enjoy your history lesson. I hope the next one is as good as the first!! I'll be waiting to continue ""The Journey""."
5,"A ""must read"" for Romantics and History buffs","One Sunday evening with nothing to do I picked up The Journey, thinking I'd read for a couple of hours. At 3:00 Monday morning I finished it. I haven't done that for 20 years! The story was captivating, to say the least. There's romance, mystery and a good deal of history that was magnificently woven through page after page. I know there's another novel tripping through this author's mind, even as I speak, and I want the first copy off the presses!"
2,Too many problems for my child to enjoy!,"My mother in law bought this fire truck for my son and he loves it. It is a shame that before a year I had to replace the battery causting me $80.00. Than the gear on the back driver side stripped. The only place to get parts is from hong kong and that took 3 months costing $50.00. Less than a month after repairing the gear they are making a horrible noise and are stripping again. I give up! It is a shame my son loves it but I would not recommend this tide on toy to anyone. We have had a 4 wheeler and a barbie jeep for years with no trouble at all. Think before wasting your money, it isn't worth the aggrevation."
5,Superior Ride-on lots of fun,"We purchased this for our Grandson, who is almost 5 for Christmas this year. He already has a gas powered quad, so we weren't sure he'd be happy with this toy, but he saw it in a Christmas catalog and wanted it.Because the speed can be adjusted it is great for him at the higher speed. He loves this toy, and with the pumper hose and sirens and working megaphone/radio, he is in Firetruck Heaven!! Many thanks to whoever thought this one up!!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"We received this as a Christmas gift and it was great for the short time it actually worked. Like other reviewers, we had similar battery issues (not available at any retail stores, took months to recieve the replacement, battery very expensive, etc.), but also other mechanical problems. Suffice to say, my kids now enjoy just ""pretending"" the thing works and playing in the fire truck and on the fire truck, since the fire truck itself hasn't run for over a year. Defintely not worth the money."
1,Arrived Broken - Pain to receive new one!,We ordered this fire truck for our two year old for Christmas. It arrived on December 21st completely damaged! The left rear was bashed in resulting in sharp shards of plastic jutting out. We are very upset and now have to figure out how to get a new one in time for Christmas! The website now says they are out of stock and the shipping company refuses to overnight to us unless we pay for it! Now we are not sure how we are going to save Christmas for our 2 year old!!
3,be prepared,"I bought my son this fire truck when he was 3 years old. He is now 5 and he loves to ride on it.. That's not very often since it's always broken. Last summer I purchased a replacement battery and they were supposed to send a connector with it, I never received it. The connection is the worst part of this toy that I have found. The plastic body is very durable. Also there's a problem with the shifter. It's a great toy if you can afford the truck in the first place, but then get your wallets out for all the replacement parts."
5,Great Ride-On Toy.,My son loved this fire truck. He and his friends have played with this toy day after day. It has held up really well with the large amount of usage it has gotten.
3,Can't find a battery?,"I got this for my son 2 years ago. It was great to see the expression on his face and worth the $$$. But now the battery is dead and I can't find one. I called Kid Trax and they told me to google ""12 volt battery"" so I did, but I can't find one that has the same plug in device on the side. So basically I am left with a hunk of plastic in my garage that I can't sell, or give away, because the battery is next to impossible to find. There are definitely less expensive ways to see that smile on your kids face, we play lots of board games indoors and I shoot hoops with him in the yard. Definitely think twice before spending the money."
1,Laughing to keep from crying,"When the pens arrived I immediately started writing with the black - filled my nice new wipe board - then went to erase, only to find the pen was permanent. So then I tried the red on my other board - but it was dry. Fortunately, the blue seems to work."
1,Only can use it for several days,"I only can use it for several days, then all the ink are gone. It seems not dry erasable. I bought it as $25 free shipping filler. Now I know I just throw my few dollars into drain."
2,Unneccesarily Complicated Examples,I am a technical trainer and had the unfortunate task of teaching a Perl class using this book. I found this book to cover all of the essentials though not do it well.In my opinion the author does not explain the details of the different functions of Perl he just assumes you know them and starts using them. He also starts using functions in early examples without first explaining what the function does. How can you learn arrays when his example has looping though he hasnt explained it yet? His examples are unneccesarily complex and could be written simply to get the same point accross.A much better book is 'Teach Yourself Perl in 24 Hours' Second Edition by Clinton Pierce. Get it and get programming with Perl today.
5,Just like I remembered from childhood.,Nothing brings back childhood Christmas memories like Andy Williams. It sounded great; just like I remembered. Thinking of buying more of his albums.
3,Lazy Mastering,"C'mon Sony! Put at least a little effort into your Christmas reissues! I own this and Andy's other Christmas album, as well as Tony Bennett's Sony Christmas album, and they did the same thing to all three - They sapped the life out of the recordings by filtering out the highest frequencies to reduce the tape hiss. They could have reduced the hiss by utilizing other methods, but that would have required effort. I guess Sony doesn't take their Christmas offerings very seriously."
4,Night Ranger,Is is the first Night Ranger C.D I have brought for 17 Years since Big Life. Not a bad album the best track on their is seven wishes. The album is far better than Big Life a with a lot rock .
3,A solid release as usual,"Night Ranger have been very even throughout their career, and ""7 wishes"" is a good album in the same vein as ""Midnight madness"" and ""Man in motion"". As usual, Night Ranger go for a blend of melodic rock and (semi) ballads. Some people like to call this pop-metal and that might be true in a way, but I don't think the guys in Night Ranger ever see themselves as a (pop) metal band. At least ""Seven wishes"", ""Four in the morning"" and ""I need a woman"" should be included on a ""best of"" album.If you're unfamiliar with Night Ranger, I suggest you start with their debut ""Dawn patrol"" from 1982, and ""Seven"" from 1998."
3,Reads like a college text book,"If they taught a Web Metrics 101 class this would be the book listed on the syllabus. Like many of my college text books in the past I hated reading them at the time but was glad I did later. In fact I actually won this book at a conference where Jim spoke. If the aforementioned class existed he is exactly how I would envision the professor, long beard, sweater,slow paced oration and all.Jim and his book are full of great information, granted they go into some ""stories"" a little more often than I would like, and many other reviewers have pointed this out already. I don't think the reader can digest more than a chapter at a time while reading this book, as there is so much to apply to your own companies problems.All in all I think this is a great foundation to build from but, as many have already pointed out it was written in 2002 and the industry has evolved in that time. I will definitely keep it on my shelf as a reference for the future."
2,So much interviews and PPLs ( for specific applications ),"It showed a couple of metrics but it's already introduced by other analytics books. And It has so much extremely interviews and introduction of specific vendor's applications ( can be thought as PPL )Novice can't get balanced overview from this, intermediates just can advertisements about applications, and experts can have nothing.Especially so many and long interview texts are mostly useless and time-consuming."
4,insightful and informative,"Sterne does a good solid job of presenting material nicely. He also talks about the important stuff. Sterne explains What to measure, how to measure it, when to measure it, but not why (i.e. what is the significance of measuring this particular metric?). Overall a real eye opener regarding web metrics and their importance in the overall value chain of the internet experience and success of the site."
5,Not Just For Corporations and Marketing Departments,"Whether you're a small business owner, a corporate manager, orsomeone just starting a business venture, Web Metrics is a must-read. For small and new business entrepreneurs who cannot afford a marketing department, Web Metrics gives an inside look into howexperts in leading industries improve their online marketingstrategies."
2,Below the plank on presenting info and citing,"The book appears to be easy to read and understand. However, it has problems in the way it references articles and presents data. I have noticed that it, for example, presents results without citing where they come from. It also cites articles which, upon actual examination, are irrelevant to what is written in the book (for example, this is how it cites MacDonald et al. on page 9). I have only read through two pages of the book, and things like that are concerning."
3,3.5 stars for sure...,"I just can't give them anything higher or else my entire rating system goes out the window! The thing is, these guys are totally out there on their own. I could try and find comparisons and pigeon-hole them into some kind of genre. But instead I'd rather just tell you how they made me feel, and hopefully that'll be more helpful than trying to describe what their music sounds like.Imagine being lost while on vacation and getting really frustrated and maybe a bit freaked. But then relaxing into the unknown and just plodding onward, not knowing where the road you're on is going to take you. That's Whirlwind Heat for me.What might sound annoying at first listen, is actually fraught with humor and fun. I can't help but think these guys were having a laugh the entire time they recorded this album. At the same time, they hit the rock button heavy and really deliver. Let them karate chop you into being a believer."
1,crap,"knew them in grand rapids. they sucked then & they suck now. they will always suck. you put a bunch of monkeys in front of a bunch of instruments eventually you'll get REVOLVER, but for the first few years, you'll get WHIRLWIND HEAT. good luck guys."
4,Great cd.,"I must say to Rachel S: you admit yourself you haven't listened to the cd...even if you saw them live, you really can't review a cd without having listened to it.I too saw them open for the White Stripes. They put on an awesome show with lots of energy. Plenty of it was over the top and almost silly but it was all in the name of rocknroll. I had extra dosh so I bought their CD on my way out; that was about eight months ago and I still give it the occasional spin. Its a good, fun cd with some phat bass lines and catchy licks. It definitely is lame as hell that they named all the songs after a different color. But who cares; this is phat indie moog punk. Definitely worth a buy."
5,"Whirlwind Heat, divine noise","i saw this band opening for the white stripes (!!) in boston on 4/20/03. i went out the next day and bought their album. the band, comprised of a drummer, bass guitarist, and lead vocalist/moog synth extraordinaire, combine pounding beats with heavy bass with reject atari sound effects. this coupled with their totally unique sense of timing makes them a band unlike any other i've heard. sure, comparisons can be drawn, but if you listen to this album with an open mind, you will be blown away. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
4,This is a very handy drill for tight spaces.,I bought this drill for work but I find it just as handy at home
1,Confusing and startlingly unmusical......,"This is not an easy video to watch. I was expecting something along the lines of world studies in instrument making, usage and performance. What I got instead was the filming of people possessed by their sect's spirits during bizarre rituals and people dancing about with fake breasts attached to strange attire. Yes, one can see different types of instruments used througout the world, but their uniqueness and purpose is totally ignored. With some escoteric clips of the Bayreuth festival and its wealthy patrons, some unexpected nudity and a vague installment with the conductor John Eliot Gardiner, the video scrapes the bottom of the barrel.In viewing the tape's third world music offering and even Bayreuth, the music making itself and its intrinsic value takes a back seat to the sensationalism producer Jeremy Marre affords the socialisms, rituals and bizarre costumes. Very poor offering about the ""nature"" of music."
3,Worthwhile for World Music class,"I use segments of this video for my World Music class. Most indigenous cultures use music for their religious/sacred ceremonies, and this video captures that very well with god possession in Indonesia and a Tromba healing ceremony from Madagascar. I also like the Hudson Bay Inuit ""throat singing"" when discussing the vocables of American Indian music. Overall, lots of good stuff from around the world, featuring music in its indigenous context."
5,it aint hay,if you like abbott and costello than you need this to complete your collectionbud and lou plus shemp how can you go wrongplot is the boys try to replace a horse but get the wrong one they get a famose race horse
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"Like one of the other reviewers, I had my original copy stolen, too. I had to wait for the reissues six years later. When I first bought this album many moons ago, it wass the soundtrack to my and my roomates' lives. We listened to it continuously, and it was all we listened to for maybe a month.This is a must have, and in my opinion, the only Galaxie 500 album that doesn't start to seem a little repitive or dull after a while.Buy it. ""It's Getting Late"" I consider the best song. Too bad there's no audio snippet."
4,4.5 stars actually...,"I'm not into abstract or modern art, in fact I ususally hate it. Same goes with so called ""psychodelic"" music, with another parallel: sometimes there's a piece or work, or music, that catches my attention and I can't let go. With Today by Galaxie 500, that's the case. This album confuses me, but in a wonderful way. The voices and melodies seem to go in and out of focus, sometimes getting fuzzy or a little too sharp for comfort. (More often fuzzy than sharp.) It feels swirly, pastel and dreamy if listened to without thought to the words, and bitter, dark and lovely if the words are added to the mix. My favourite song, ""Tugboat"", is a good example of the strangeness...it sounds to me (though I'm probably wrong) to be about a deranged illegal alien, who only wants work and nothing more! Finally, why did I give it 4.5 and not 5 stars? Sometimes you can't be in the mood for abstract no matter how nice, only something tangible will fit."
2,Not quite what i thought...,"The colors are off, not nearly as vivid as the picture might suggest. The colors are much more sea green then blue. not what i thought i was getting but will have to do until i can find another. Though it says it fits most, the wheel sometimes slips under the cover as you make turns- i have a standard size steering wheel (2006 Chevy Cobalt)"
4,Not Bad...,"The inner flames are more green than blue, although I still like the feel of it. Not too bad of a cover..."
1,Good book - but badly edited kindle version,"I like the books of Janwillem van de Wetering and have read some of the print books. Unforunately the kindle version contains so many recurring spelling mistakes- e.g. ""th"" becomes ""m"", so ""them"" becomes ""mem"", Ms. Carnet becomes Ms. Camet and so on. I found an average of 3 spelling mistakes per page. I wonder if anybody has ever proofread the text before it got published. For a kindle book that costs $13.79 and is more expensive than any printed version I expect more value for money. This is the first time that I am realy disappointed by the quality of a kindle book - mind you, not by the author an his writing."
5,I would give this 10 stars if I could,"This is the sixth Grijpstra and de Gier mystery I have read and it is the best so far in a series of pretty good mysteries. In fact, it is among the best mysteries I have ever read. The interweaving of memorable descriptiveness, philosophizing by the cops and suspects, and police procedure is just top rate and makes it a book that is difficult to put down. I can't recall any other mystery in which I have turned down page corners so that I could go back and re-read passages."
4,Great for beginners and teachers.,"I'm in a teaching credential program, and was assigned this book. If you already have a familiarity with Microsoft Office, whether in Mac or Windows, you won't need it; there's very little in it that you don't already know. But if you have NO familiarity with it, it's a pretty good introduction. If you're a teacher, it has some practical bits in it for you.For those of you who have Office 2004 (like me) it's still applicable; it just doesn't have the new features of 2004 included in it. But since the program's biggest new feature is that it locks up less, you won't miss much."
4,Progessive Metal at its best!,"A band from Sweden that masters progressive metal, they are simply the gods of prog. Not there best record but definetly one prog fans should listen too.9 Tracks each with a different sound a uniqueness of catchy solos, riffs and structure."
1,just to get your attention,Most of these reiews are for a book! The product shown is a video!Another comment on here says they are completely different!consider yourself warned.
5,Lathe basics in one package,"Really nice basic principles of wood turning. Good first book, then follow with Turning Wood. I tried it backwards, so I recommend this order..."
2,Used Book in Poor Shape,"I received the book promptly but it was well worn. Still readable, but the binder was coming unglued.I guess used means really used!"
3,missing package,Finally! Amazon did promptly return my emails. Overall im glad i bought the cabinet it's perfect for my job criteria. If only they had gotten the packaging rite the first time. Actually ended up returning original package cause it only contained the cabinet no cart. Free of charge.
2,On the low end of mediocre,"The 20th Century Masters entry into the Irish Rovers' Greatest Hits menagerie is on the low end of both; weak by Irish Rovers' standards and one of the lesser efforts in Universal Music's Millennium Collection.The mastering is fair, with no glaring problems, but the sound is a bit muddy and the bass track rather weak.The up-side of this collection is that several songs can be hard to find, especially the Tom Paxton cult-classic ""Wasn't That a Party?"". The down side is that many are re-recordings. This isn't terribly noticeable on gentle tunes like ""The Unicorn"" but is both disappointing and annoying on the aforementioned lively drinking song ""Wasn't That a Party?"".If all the buyer wants is to add an Irish Rovers collection to his or her musical library, this CD will do. If, however, one desires a bit more quality in sound and more adherence to the original music, pass this one by and look elsewhere."
4,song i need to find,"can someone please help me with a song , while snoop was talking to the apartment mgr about his water there was a song playing sound like luther vandross can someone please help me with a title of the song and artist"
4,really couldn't find a bad track on this one,"Dr. Dre, Snoop and Hitman put together a bangin west coast gem. I was introduced to this CD while riding with my brother in ATL traffic. Anyone living in ATL knows I must've had plenty of time to hear it. The track that cought my attention the most was ""Everytime"" by TOI, a true vibing gem to groove to. The Slum Village instrumental (sampled from Herbie Handcock) works well with her voice. Other gems that stand out are: ""No - Joe Beast"" and ""Bad Intentions - Knoc-turn'al"". Dr. Dre seems to bring out the "".../player"" side of Bilal in my favorite track ""Bring 2"". I'm surprised that this CD didn't catch on, maybe it did......I don't listen to radio that much to find out anyway.oNe"
1,Vhs Quality Dvd disc.,The movie was a good entertaining movie when I was a kid. This dvd product looks like a 1985 vhs quality tape. It is of extremely poor quality. The movie is a decent and intelligent movie. I am sending the dvd? Back.
4,...,"If you buy this movie thinking you are getting something that will remind you of Mission to Mars or Armageddon, you will be sadly mistaken, probably many, many times in your life. If you buy this movie because you like crazy, old movies about silly things happening in outerspace (like astronauts landing on Venus and popping open their helmets to breathe the air, and toteing around hulking robots who don't seem to have any function other than to hulk), and like to compare the knowledge of space then to knowledge now, you will find these two movies to be fulfilling! Watch them both, and compare the crews' attitudes to travel, equipment, each other, the mission etc. Then compare those attitudes to modern space travel and modern space movies. It is an interesting thing to do at 1:00 am when you can't sleep."
2,Cheesy fun-not quite,"This movie is below par 60's sci-fi . Though Stanislaw Lem stories have been brought to the big screen successfully, ie Solaris, this movie falls short of mark. Poor dubbing and bad special effects are hindered by even worse story development. However, if you are looking to relive the days of quarter matinees, make up some popcorn and grab your JuJuBees."
2,i'm a big sci-fi fan but this movie was just bad.,"I was very disapointed in this movie. Ther was really no plot, and all the actors just kept babaling on about nothing trying to sound inteligent. They had this stupid little robot that would get in the way and run over one of the guys. They even left one of there crew members on venus for no reason and at the end of the movie they were all sobbing about it. It didn't make sence. very stupid movie , don't watch it."
2,Thoughts of 'First Spaceship on Venus',"This DVD is in need of cleaning up. The images are quite blurry, out of focus and the color seems to be washed out quite a bit. It was probably pulled from a VHS at one point or from very old and un-kept 35mm reals, the transfer was not entirely successful. The story itself is different though. It does become 'long running' after a while. They do have one of the coolest looking spaceships I have ever seen in a SciFi movie though, I have to give them that."
2,Chopped to bits,"This version is so chopped up that it's difficult to tell what's going on. I can't help thinking that there might have been an interesting movie in there, but between the awkward dubbing into English and the abrupt jumps in scenes, it's just too difficult to follow to be really fun.An attempt at scientific accuracy (for what was known in 1959) seems to have been attempted in the first few minutes of the movie, but as it goes on it gets increasingly wacky; losing any pretense of being hard science fiction. It's visually interesting at points; that's about all it has going for it. It does get points for the interracial crew and a decent spaceship. But it's hard to recommend this one, overall."
3,Switch on the emergency gyro,"It is the 1962 view of 1985 (they could have picked 1984). All is right with the world. We discover a rock that contains a spool (what ever a spool is); the spool is discovered to contain a message. And want a message. In 1908 Tunguska (read the facts about this in the book ""The Fire Came by: The Riddle of the Great Siberian Explosion"" by John Baxter - 1976) a great explosion took place. Evidently this was a space vehicle of extraterrestrial origin. It jettisoned the spool upon exploding.We do not have time to decipher the message now so it will have to be deciphered on the way to Venus. Our East German space ship rivals those of Japanese sci-fi with one exception. This ship has an emergency Gyro that can only be activated by using a special hammer to break the glass.Mean time what will we find on Venus and will it destroy or carry a message to all mankind.First Spaceship On Venus 16x9 Version"
5,GREAT DVD FROM IMAGE!!!,"I have so many copies of this film on vhs & dvd... but I've always liked this sci-fi mini-classic so much that I kept looking for the perfect print...Look no further, this is IT!!!IMAGE has given us a pristine, color-adjusted gem!Yoko Tani heads a multi-national/racial cast that blasts off in search of life on Venus and encounters many dangers and several deaths. Intelligent script, fine acting & astounding set pieces make for great sci-fi viewing.And it's all so beautiful to look at!Great print. Great price!Recommended viewing."
3,Angry Dead Planet...,"It is 1985. The world is a place of global harmony. All cultures, races, etc. live together in perfect bliss. Into this utopia comes a strange cylinder with an alien message, unearthed in the Gobi desert. Upon investigation, it is discovered that the cylinder has come from Venus. A crew of intrepid scientists is enlisted to board the Cosmostrater spacecraft and head for our sister planet. On the way, they decode the rest of the message, only to find out that the venusians had planned on using nuclear weaponry to destroy the earth! This adds an element of dread and danger to the mission, especially when our heroes land on Venus and encounter a dark, haunted landscape. I really like the living black ooze that chases three of the daring cosmonauts toward certain doom! FSOV is a cheesy delight with enough goofy charm to outweigh it's bouts of awkwardness. I enjoy watching it every few years..."
3,"A ""SO-SO"" DVD","Sure, the quality of this DVD is not good, but actually it works quite well for these movies, of witch the first is definitely very boring, but the other has a nice eerie atmosphere and is actually well crafted. A good price-quality thing here anyway."
2,You get what you pay for,"NOT as described by Amazon or the jacket - not the 130 minute original but the 78 minute dubbed version shown in the UK. The same poor quality picture (resolution 720 x 480) and sound as the 2000 release but much cheaper.Based on Lem's 1951 first novel The Astronauts the theme is pacifist - compare with the also 1959 ""On the Beach"".The fuzzy images on the DVD do not do justice to the excellent camerawork and (for the time) special effects.At this price worth getting to compare with US films of the period."
4,For Classic Sci Fi Lovers,"I bought this film based on vague childhood memories of neat movie about a dark and mysterious planet being visited by an international crew from Earth. I was not disappointed. Although its translation into English adds a hokey air and a few chuckles due to some rather clumsy dialog, special effects (not high tech) and a generally good story line make this an interesting and highly entertaining film. If you're a SciFi buff, this film is a must."
1,Worst quality ever!,The quality of this DVD is terrible. The image was so bad that I had to stop the movie after 5 minutes. Do not buy this DVD!
5,This is the Biggest Sc-Fi Film ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I first saw this film I thought it would not be good, but by I was wrong!!! This movie was genius from the story to the chacters to the special effects. Since I first bought it I have watched it time and time again and like the DVD cover said This is Mankind's biggest jounary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,incorrectly labeled - now corrected,"This is the 80-minute version chopped for US distribution, not the 130-minute European version. I can't blame Amazon - the DVD box clearly states ""running time 130 minutes,"" but the feature only runs 80 minutes and there is no other material on the disc.*** Addendum: I'm glad to see that Amazon reacted promptly to my review and changed the running time in the product description. The story is a little herky-jerky in its shortened form, but the movie is still interesting for fans of old sci-fi, and some original plot elements almost compensate for the primitive special effects and stereotypical characters.***Another addendum: in response to Brian Thibodeau's comments, I rechecked my copy of this DVD which I purchased here on Amazon. The feature runs 80 minutes. I'm glad to hear that a 95-minute version exists on DVD, but it's not the one that Amazon sent me."
3,**BEWARE! The dolts at FRF...,"...list this as being ""16:9 enhanced"" on the back cover when it is in fact, NOT.Their lame excuse: ""Well, thats what the distributor told us"" (!)It didnt dawn on them to check first, and THEN print the coversThe odd thing is that the DVD from Germany is 16:9 enhanced-and can be ordered at Amazon.de...---The familiar name of this is actually FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS, (or DER SCHWEIGENDE STERN)UMass has put out the disc with lectures and commentaties for their German Film Studies Department-but the cost is a scholarly $200!;This is the fullest version known to exist, will be in German, with English subs, and the original music. It is also 16 mins longer than the current disc of FSOV."
2,Old si-fi movie,Funny how human memory tends to remember just certainfragments of old movies like these over the years.The movie had some neat stage sets and special effects.The space ship design is still a beautiful thing afterall these years. The movie is difficult to watch withthe dubbed English and jumpy editing. I sure did rememberthe growing blob chasing the crew up the spiral tower.I would only recommend this for people walking downmemory lane for movies they might have seen at thedrive-in many decades ago.
4,Available on DVD (Region 1),"Brand is available in Region 1 as part of the DVD set called ""The Henrik Ibsen Collection."" You can search for it here at Amazon.com."
5,Classic!!,"I still have the original cd that I got in '92! This album brings back alot of memories of my crazy and wild days! I'm from the Philly area, and I think me and my boys were the only ones around that knew about Willie D and the Geto Boys. My favorite songs on the album would be ""Trenchcoats & Gangster hats"" and ""My Alibi"" But over all definatly a sentimental favorite from my teenage days! Great album from Beginning to end Willie D never pulls any punches! He's a wild dude!"
2,Vendetta,"Hey Vendetta, didn't you have a record out yourself? Also, weren't you a crossing guard? Anyway, I liked his first album better. Balled headed hoes and welfare bitches is off the chain. I still bang that til this day! Willie Dee is the man. Damn shame he got arrested for cell phone scams"
4,"A vintage classic, but no 850 MHz","I bought this phone new years ago. It was the original smartphone, and cost me $700. Users in the US need to be aware that it works on GSM frequencies 900/1800/1900 MHz. It does not work on 850 MHz. In the US, 900 and 1800 are not used for cell phones. T-mobile uses 1900 and roams on 850. ATT works primarily on 850 with some 1900. In the past, I used this phone with a T-Mobile SIM all across the US, and it worked almost everywhere I went. In those areas where there was only a 850 signal and no 1900 signal it would not work. This phone also picks up WIFI. The 9500 can be compared to the Nokia 9300, which did not have Wifi, but the 9300 phones sold by Cingular were manufactured to use 850 instead of 900MHz."
1,Don't waste your time,"I can't say too much for it, since I couldn't get it to play. I used the battery enclosed, tried a different one from a brand new package...no luck. In the future I'll stick with companies with which I'm familiar."
5,AT THE PEAK OF THEIR FORM,"Of all the cds I have by Norman Blake, with or without Nancy, this is without a doubt my favorite. Every track on this cd is a gem. The arrangements are simple and unadorned, and therefore incredibly effective. There's a minimum of overdubbing here -- this is pretty close to what these two sound like in performance.The recording quality is superb, and adds immeasurably to the overall enjoyment of this wonderful music. There are great stories told here, there is pathos and humor side by side. From the very start of 'Little stream of whisky' until the last notes fade away at the end of the disc, this music is pure and uncluttered -- the playing is right 'on the fret' and the vocals complement the songs perfectly.With the current interest in 'Americana' music, Norman and Nancy Blake's catalogue is a treasure-trove that I hope many people will discover. One of my favorite acoustic albums of all time, this is a classic."
4,Real Nice,"I picked this up at the public library,not really knowing anything about this group,other than I saw a fellow musician list them as an influence in an ad looking for bandmates. I was pleasantly surprised by this release which just connects on so many levels,from Kraftwerk like electronica to 70's conceptual Floyd-isms to Beatle like pop (well actually more reminiscent of Klaatu than the fab four), all with amazing production. Well worth a listen. I want to hear their other stuff if people are saying it's actually better than this."
4,"Intelligent, catchy, and it can space you out","I love how all reviewers like to slam anything that smacks of ""prog"". Aim low and punky and you're ""keeping it real"". Aim high and you're ""pretentious"". By their lights, no one should ever think, no one should ever question, no one should ever experiment. We should all conform to the lowest common denominator. Well SOME of us are bored by your 3-chord blunderbusses like Third Eye Blind and your self-absorbed posers like Kid Rock. We want to be able to sit and listen to a song and hear something NEW in it each time we listen to it. Air provides some of that in this album."
2,Not Moon Safari,The day this album came out I rushed to buy it. It was very exciting for me because Air are a favourite band of mine.I put it onto the stereo and began listing - I was delighted by the first track but at first the new synth voice wasn't my cup of tea however I have become very fond of it. The next few tracks I must admit were not my sort of thing in fact they were not Air like I know Air. There are a couple of other great tracks on this album although I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who likes the proper Air.
1,A Disaster!!,"...Air is very good when they concentrate in what they do best which is instrumental music. An exception to this is the beautifully crafted song All I Need from the Moon Safari CD. In this CD they venture into songs that really don't go anywhere. This has to be by far the worst CD I have ever purchased. And I have over 700 CD's in my collection. It sounds so dissonant and amateurish at times that I couldn't believe it was the same group who did Moon Safari, Premiers Symptomes and the soundtrack from Virgin Suicides. Please, do not believe the Pink Floyd references. The only piece of music of Pink Floyd that sounds similar to this is the howling of the dog from the CD Animals. It is impossible to pin point a fault or a weakness in this project because is a complete disaster. If you are curious about this CD just wait a couple of days and buy it used. I guarantee you that the used CD market will be flooded with this piece of garbage. A major disappointment from two good musicians."
2,Indie pop continues to ruin electronic music,"When a band's entire body of work is based around irony and kitsch, one begins to suspect that they simply don't have anything original or interesting to say.There are a few so-so moments on this album, but it's impossible to escape the self-absorbed, look-how-inauthentic-we-are schtick. Schmaltzy pop arrangements, accompanied by cheesy drum machine beats and love-song lyrics sung by a Macintosh - did the world really need this? Guys, if you don't have anything meaningful to say, just shut up. The signal-to-noise ratio in pop culture is bad enough as it is.The only thing stopping me from giving this album one star is the last track, ""Caramel Prisoner"", which is *almost* a good song. At least, I can listen to it all the way through without cringing, unlike the rest of the disc."
2,Another letdown,"Even though ""Virgin Suicides"" was a huge disappointment, I resigned myself to believing that Air just wasn't quite ready to begin scoring films (although it probably seemed like a good idea in theory). I hoped for a return to form on their next studio album, but while you can hear slight echoes of Moon Safari all over this CD, sadly, none of these tracks even come close to anything on that brilliant debut. In fact, having recently listened to Safari again to see if I had misjudged Air, one can only ask: where is Beth Hirsch when we need her most?"
2,Disappointing!!!!!!!!!,"HO NO! This album is nothing like the AIR that we knew. the only good songs are: how does it make you feel?, don't be light, radio#1 and and... nop that's it."
1,Blowing.,"The only redmption factor here is the appearance of KEN ANDREWS (YEAR OF THE RABBIT, ON) on a couple of tracks and even that doesn't make it any better. This is French computer geek music. Sorry, way too European for me. This is a good record if you like DEITER'S DANCE CLUB on SNL."
2,When I first got it I hated it....,"This album is louder than Moon Safari. When I put it on in my car, I just about blew my head off from the pounding I got from the subwoofer (I had been listening to something quiter and the volume was cranked). It annoyed me because not only did it not provide me with that warm mellow feeling I craved but it annoyed fellow motorists too. Yes the first track has bass. My initial conclusion was that this is the sort of CD destined for people who don't necessarily like music, rather the noise it makes. The sort of person who you can hear several blocks away when driving.That aside, I've been listening to it. And I don't hate it. But I don't like it. Air, I fear, have lost thier innocence."
2,Overindulgent artists stuck in-between,"2 1/2Make no mistake, there are a couple beautiful songs on here (or at least several which have beautiful parts inside the experimental electronic confusion), but for the most part people who slap the ol' sophomore slump label upon Air's much anticipated follow up to Moon Safari would be in the clear. In labored, pretentious, but shallow structural dabblings the French duo strain for an artsy depth merely hinted at with their spacey, more intuitive debut. Between the often stilted compositions and a few awkward genre leaps, 10,000 Hz becomes clouded by it's own self-absorption. One hardly notices then, quite a few contrastingly solid ideas inserted into the bloated disc, hinting at the more complex, melodically driven approach that would usher in Talkie Walkie's warmer reception."
3,different,Different is good but I don't think this is as good as Moon Safari.The space oddysey feel is fine but I prefer the lighter feel that Moon Safari offers. I can relax to that but not to this with as easily. Radian is by far my favorite with How Does This Make You Feel? coming in close seconds.I'm not crazy about the lyrics on some of the songs while musically I do still enjoy them. This is one of those bands where I still like them even if the direction has changed a little. We'll just have to see where Air take us next.
2,Hurm.,"I haven't really warmed to this CD yet. And yes I do love Premiers Symptomes and Moon Safari, but I don't think I was just expecting more of the same. I like a few tracks (Electronic Performers, Radian, The Vagabond), but what I really find annoying is the use of the Macintalk voice on How Does It Make You Feel. IMO that Mac voice synthesizer is SO annoying, for me it makes an otherwise interesting track unlistenable. Not to mention that this has already been overdone by other artists (Radiohead, Pink Floyd)..."
2,Ouch!,"Air is one of many dance groups from france, but apart from Superfunk, Modjo and Daft Punk they are doing more slow relax music then electro kind of like Royksopp, nothing bad with that cause many songs on the album are exellent if you like that kind of dance but when they put Beck in the mix they lose all credability and respect from me. Some songs are as far away from dance as you can come, some decent relax music and a few exceptions are pop-dance, ""Radio #1"" is good, a pop-dance tune with good hook. I thought the album wuld be much harder, the title gives me the feeling of something more electronic, however it's allright but nothing that will go down in history."
3,Propelleronique,"I was driving down the desert freeway. Air was on. It felt like I was being propelled into Air by the music. Melancholy, futuristic, surrealistic. Post-something. Songs start with earthy acoustics and reach an electronic climax of sadness and questioning. Questioning of the very essence of life. ""Do I need destiny?"" Love ya."
5,Wonder Air,"Airs latest compilation of sounds is wonderful. Unlike its previous offerings the album explores a darker and more deeper sound. Moon Safari is a lighter, but less creative offering, refreshing but not unique. 10000hz legend, however sounds like no other, featuring such talents as Buffalo Girl and Beck. A more satirical and addictive sound. It's the type of record you hate at first but than love. Always as good as before no matter how many times over played."
4,Why would you build a house right on a cliff?,"If like air, you should get this CD. some tracks are different than the standard air style, but they still carry ""air-esc"" properties. This CD is very good, and half the tracks you will get the old Air style you loved, they are just progressing a little with this CD. You can listen to the whole CD without skipping any tracks. Buy it, and get one for the kiddies."
5,DREAM,"Yes, it is probably not the same safari on the moon, but, the adventure is still here and the stroll in the land of the Hobbits and of the Tolkien's monsters goes on.Thank You, in this world, to give me some air!"
5,Great Follow-Up To Moon Safari,"Undoubtedly, this CD has more songs with lyrics and songs with the potential to receive air play than Moon Safari had. However, the CD still retains that special Air quality established on Moon Safari wherein the listener is grabbed immediately and whisked away to a special and unique place of electronic melancholy. Some highlights are track #2 ""How Does It Make You Feel"" where we hear the deeply personal love cries of an alien / robot creation and track #5 Radian which is a return of sorts to the slowly developing acoustic / electronic instrumental that was prevalent on Moon Safari. For the rest of the CD fairly straight forward rhythms supporting lyrics with space sound interruptions is the norm."
1,Ugh...,"Air just keeps going downhill. ""Premiers Symptomes"" was excellent. ""Moon Safari"", despite the dumb title, had its excellent moments. But I should've seen it coming with the tracks ""Sexy Boy"" and ""Remember"", two horrible, horrible euro-pop clunkers. The cover of the album ""10,000 Hz"" pretty much explains the content: interesting at first, kind of silly, then you realize what it is...poor, overbearing art. Someone explain to me why ""Radio #1"" is so darn good? By the time I got to ""People in the City"" I was thoroughly shocked.Air's saving grace is its good background melodies. As for vocals and effects, I don't know what the fudge Dunckel and Godin were thinking. What happened to the mellow, 70's feel of ""Symptomes""? What about the airy tracks of ""Safari"" and ""The Virgin Suicides""? I know that Air are ""artists"", and they must ""evolve"", but for Christ's sake! Make music for humans, not computers."
2,A very mixed and mostly misguided effort,"... The most embarrassing tracks on this album (at least 1,2,3,maybe 5,maybe 9) are full of jejune chord progressions, inane lyrics, and bad synthesized vocals that could be background tracks to a bad ""B"" movie. ... This should be titled ""25,000 Hz Legend"" because then only dogs and bats could be listening. Unfortunately, you have interesting tracks such as 10-Don't Be Light and 11-Caramel Prisoner which are worth a listen in their own right (as are Beck's pieces), so I can't be entirely dismissive of this effort. What was interfering with Air's musical sensibilities early on in this album? Beck's supplying free pralines?"
1,"Keep the cover, toss the album","Another reviewer raved its like 'Kraftwerk meets Pink Floyd'. I don't want either of those bands to shake hands, much less meet.I can't think of a bigger disappointment this year other than my last haircut. I realize you are French but where is the vocoder filtered pop-soul ? More Human League less Prog-Rock steady. Its hard to pick on one track because they offend the senses equally."
2,Sounds like a bunch of experimental crap,"This album is NOTHING like Moon Safari. It seriously sounds like some of the bizarre things I hear on college radio and Shoutcast stations with poor playlists. To their credit, no two songs sound alike. But I never complain about songs sounding alike if it's a song I like to hear. The songs on this album are... different. They start off one way, then go off in some other direction like some kind of tangent. It's weird. Some people like this kind of weird, some don't. I personally could do without this experimental noise."
1,spiritual shoc!,I'M {I WAS!)A VERY BIG FAN OF AIR SINCE THEIR CREATION IN FRANCE.I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED OF THEIR NEW CD:10000HZ.I JUST DON'T OR CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPEND TO THEM!?THIS CD HAS NO CHARACTER AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR USUEL ALBUMS.IT IS JUST LIKE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR FAN.I DON'T EVEN WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THEM AGAIN AND I THREW THE CD AWAY:I WAS ASHAMED TO GIVE IT TO SOMEONE!THANK YOU AIR!INSTEAD OF EVOLVING YOU ARE GOING DOWN LIKE THE CD'S SOLD IN SUPERMARKETS.REMEMBER HOW GREAT WAS:LE SOLEIL EST PRES DE MOI.THIS SONG IS SO POWERFULL! WHAT HAPPEND TO AIR?
2,The only Air album to avoid...,"First off, I like Air. Ever since Moon Safari, I have turned on many of friends to it. Premiers Symptomes is pretty good. So is the Virgin Suicides soundtrack. Those last two aren't amazing, but they have their moments.So, I was all excited when I heard about 10hz Legend coming out. I was equally disappointed when I finally heard the album. Very different from their earlier works, and most of it isn't worth your time. The only tracks I recommend are Vagabond and Radian. Those two are great, but it's Beck that makes Vagabond so awesome. Radian recalls some of their early work. If you can get your hands on those tracks while avoiding the rest, you'll be doing well. Good luck."
2,Poor effort,"A very poor effort. This is definitely going to be Air's worst album in the long run. This is a similar effort to Depeche Mode's ""Songs of Faith and Devotion"", and U2's ""Rattle and Hum"" if you catch my drift."
2,Can't get into this,"I have heard Air quite a bit on XM in the past couple of years, and their music always seems to get my attention. So, when I saw this in a local pawn shop a few days ago, I thought it would make for some neat listening in my newly-purchased 2005 Ford Five Hundred. I played it a couple of times when I realized this collection just wasn't what I was hoping it would be - that it might sound very interesting on first listen but the novelty starts fading fast upon repeated listens. I believe that Air has much better music available than this direction-less, experimental fluff. I'd recommend avoiding this album and try some of their others."
5,Breath of Fresh Air,"10,000 HZ Legend echoes of the same end-of-wine-bottle serenity that plastered its way through Moon Safari, although, in a fuzzier, more cerebrally senseless, German Expressionist vein. Beth Hirsch's dreamy soaring is this time replaced by Buffalo Daughter's ""we are Siamese earthling"", vocals on ""Sex Born Poison"". Beck, who previously re-mixed ""Sexy Boy"" for the pair, now hitches a ride through the moog landscape and puts his rangey, lonestar stamp on ""The Vagabond"" and ""Don't Be light"".However, you can only expect to arrive at Godin and Dunckel's wavelength after jumping on the bandwagon and cruising through their lost world a few times. But the destination is so beautifully multifaceted and shiveringly sublime that you will want to reside there, amongst the blossoming synthesizers and let the drunken, robotic lullaby send you to sleep..."
4,do not expect another moon safari,"let's get it straight: AIR didn't release a second moon safari. Not better, not worse, just different. Give it a try. Stop complaining."
4,VERY interesting,"Well, it's certainly not as immediately gratifying like Moon Safari, but that seems to be a good thing. Unlike other reviewers, i really liked this album the first time I heard it, yet something seemed a bit off about it. That ""thing"" kept me coming back for repeated listenings. It really has grown with each listening. I love things that manage to be completely goofy and friggin beautiful at the same time. I don't think it is a perfect album, but I think it is just as good, if not better than Moon Safari (which I would also give 4 stars). I don't think there is a bad song here, but The Vagabond is VERY MUCH out of place, It is a great song, but it belongs on a Beck album, not this one. I much prefer Beck's guest work on Don't be light. On that Track he is integrated into Air's song instead of being the whole show. But this is the only song that sticks out, and like I said, it's still a good song. It's a great album and definately worth the money."
4,"More serious album lacks lightness of first, great inovation","A combination of Moon Safari and the more caustic Virgin Suicides, AIR's third major relase is a stray from the ambient and instrumental Moon Safari. 10000 Hz is definatley AIR but with more VOX voclas and influences from Beck (who lends a lot to the evolution of AIR). If you enjoyed the Virgin Suicides soundtrack you'll love 10000 Hz. If you loved Moon Safari you should definatly check 10000 Hz out it's a great new step for AIR."
2,Disappointing . . .,"I made the mistake of buying this album before listening to it, based on how much I had loved Moon Safari, The Virgin Suicides (soundtrack) and Premiers Symptomes. This album simply is not as good as any of these other albums. It has a couple of okay tracks, but does not hold up as a whole. Listen before you buy this one . . ."
2,Blech!,"There are a few songs on this album I really really hate. How Does it Make You Feel? Like cussing and fast forwarding. Talk about hit/miss. Let's hope the boys can rebound; however in the meantime I have written them off my automatice purchase/""must have"" list. Too bad. What happens when you start believing that you're genius."
1,breakfast in america,"I gave this cd to my uncle,a man with the bad habit of listen- ing to bands like,Genesis,Emerson Lake and Palmer,Pink Floyd and God have mercy on his soul,Supertramp! I really liked Moon Safari, but this one is just to preatens- ious,self indulgent and boring.Justlike Beck,the most over- ated man in pop.And where is the soul(s). Buy The crooners Soft Escape instead !"
3,hot air,a sarcastic release that has little to do with the dreamy moogscapes that this french band is known for.here you will find a collection of tongue-in-cheek grooves with vacant choruses unable to penetrate the kitsch barrier.the music itself isn't all that bad but it's the attitude of the songs that makes the album cute at best.
5,Review of Computer Case,"I find the bag to be superior in many ways... it offers excellent protection to the computer... it has many ""carrier"" friendly features like the expanding file/projector section, the zip out water bottle holder AND the cell phone carrier... Best of all, the shoulder strap has a superb design that helps distribute the weight of the computer across my whole shoulder -- making it much easier to carry and greatly reducing any discomfort. I have bought several of these cases and have many of my office staff hooked on it too!"
1,"Taste great, does nothing","This is one of the best tasting preworkout powders I have tasted. It would be great if it did anything for me. To get the same effect as a Red Bull, you have to use 5 scoops. I would not recommend this."
1,Not what i thought it was going to be,It would have been nice if it would have gotten to my house before it turned all hard instead of being powder. I wouldnt recomend this to anyone!! i have been using it and i don't see the point in having to crush it down to smaller pieces to be able to mix in order to drink it. Not worth what they charge for it.
4,Good tool but needs improvements,"This is a wonderful tool for working in close quarters. It is part of DeWalt's cordless line so that it has the cheerful yellow color and a long life battery. All of my other DeWalt tools are 18 volt; I have no understanding of why this tool does not come in an 18 volt model. In addition, this tool lacks a variable clutch. It has a 2-speed transmission, but no clutch. This doesn't make a lot of sense. I think that the tool would be vastly improved if it came in 18v and with a clutch. Except for these weaknesses, it does what it is supposed to do."
4,"Agreed w/ Mr Sievert, Good drill, not great","This drill works pretty well although it stalls out easily with an auger bit on regular 2x joists. In addition, the battery life leaves much to be desired. Today a full battery only managed 2 3/4"" holes in 5 joists (that's 10 holes) before dieing.If you're looking to make a lot of holes in 1 day, you're going to need something else.An 18V model would really rock."
3,My kit was somewhat different,"I bought mine on eBay, and it came with 2 batteries. The batteries are the smallest 14.4's I've seen from DeWalt. They aren't the XRP's or even the XR's. They don't pack the punch (or duty cycle) of the larger 14.4's in any of my cordless DeWalts. I wonder if those with the short lived batteries have the same downsized 14.4's.As the description says, this is a niche tool. It's a nice tool for limited applications. It's great for drilling cabinet faces and the occasional stud. But, I agree with the others who say that this tool is not intended for drilling studs all day.My main complaint with this tool is the chuck. a 1/2"" chuck would make this a more useful tool. The larger XR, or XRP batteries would be a big improvement as well. On the occasions when you need to get into a tight spot it's great, but in all honesty, I don't use mine very much."
3,Interesting drill,The drill works perfectly has advertised except that it is just a little too big when working in small or tight areas especially with 2 1/2 to 3 inch screws. It is also just a little heavy.
3,As expected,"I read the other reviews about there being no volume control and the voice being slightly irritating--I'd have to agree. However, it is educational and the adults had some fun with it at christmas."
5,We loved it.,"My Son absoultely loved this game. He was 6 when he got it, I wish he had gotten it earlier."
