2,Oklahoma../ Sound of Music/,"Oklahoma. It is not possible to give you any answer to this as this video went to a friend in America, especially as it was posted direct to them.Sound of Music. Bit dissappointed with this one as the whole Video's Pictures appeared to be misty. I have an original one of this film (Video) and it is better colour, and a joy to look at. This was going to be a presentbut at the moment, I know that I would not give it to the person."
5,OKLAHOMA - OK!,Saw this movie for the 1st time back in 1955 - it was just as great as I remembered it. The soundtrack is superb and the movie was shot on location so the scenery is just beautiful.
2,"Nice for watching once, but THAT'S ENOUGH!!!!","This movie was all right, but I still can't say that I truly enjoyed it. In my opinion, it was much too long for the plot and it just got exceptionally slow at times. The dancing is not so great either. The numbers are very average and mediocre.Personally, I like 'Singing in the Rain' and 'Silk Stockings.' They also contain some ballet/dream sequences and have much more personality."
1,You Have Got To Be Kidding Me!,"I would have given Oklamhoma! no stars at all, however, one was a low as I could get.I don't know what people see in this film. It is one of the worst things I have ever seen followed by Carousel. However, this is much, much worse. I love musicals, but this is terrible, absolutely terrible! Every second of this film made me want to scream.If you want to see a REAL and ENTERTAINING musical, go check out some of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies from the thirties. Then you'll see what you have been missing!"
1,trite,"Even though I was in the musical, I still think this is one of the most boring and trite musicals ever written. The music, for the most part, is good though, so just buy the soundtrack."
1,Oklahoma!,"This DVD is in letterbox (wide-screen) format and I will return it as soon as I receive it. I refuse to watch any movie in letterbox format on my PC or TV. I have no intention of ever getting a wide-screen TV. Anyone who now has or is planning to get a wide-screen TV should be warned: If wide-screen TVs ever become popular, Hollywood will quit making wide-screen movies and switch to IMAX."
1,This is on my top five list of awful movies!,"Oklahoma! is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I usually love watching musicals, but this film killed me. The plot is terrible and down right confusing and the music isn't memorable. Don't waste your time watching Oklahoma."
1,oklahoma 50th anniversary,I have read the scathing reviews and am now perturbed. This dvd I was going to buy. The previous release was not all that good but I was expecting better things this time. It seems that Fox have upset many customers this time and definitely need to come up with some solution. It does make you wonder what the thinking is when a Todd A O presentation is seemingly so bad.Right.....Fox . You have been badly damned in these reviews. It seems your credibility now demands some action to put right this bad disc presentation. It can be done and it seems your customers on this occasion are demanding it. I wonder if you are going to listen? I hope so.
2,Great movie but VERY poor DVD transfer,"This is a great movie but the image quality on this transfer to DVD is just horrible. Now and then the colors are bright and well saturated and the film (print) looks fairly clean but in nearly every other respect the image quality is quite bad. There are many scenes where the image shimmer and flutter and edge artifacts are so bad that the viewing experience is completely ruined. In addition somewhere in the transfer from film they managed to introduce many odd shadows and visual defects that remain fixed on the image for long periods of time (looks like large out of focus pieces of dust in the optical system).This should have been a must have DVD for any fan of musicals. Instead we have something that is very disappointing because of the poor image quality. These comments refer to the CBS/Fox widescreen DVD version that was released in 1999. Ironically, this DVD is marketed with the THX Digitally Mastered label (""Superior Picture Quality"" -- NOT!!!)."
1,Shame Fox Shame.,Yes well you guessed it.I too think that fox have managed the release of this badly.Fox should outsource any re-release to Warners who know how to manage these things appropriatly.Shame Fox Shame.I'm sure you're reading this fox people. What action are you taking ?Amazon is a powerful tool and I might suggest that in the future you choose to test market some of your products with the people who are focused on quality. Or you will continue to receive feedback that has people choose not to buy your products.Something PositiveI did however enjoy hearing Ms Jones talk about the experienceof filming this wonderful musical.
4,Is 2005 Anniversary edition better than the 1999 DVD?,"I have compared the 2005 50th Anniversary Edition DVD to the 1999 digitally mastered DVD for both video and audio. Visually, the Cinemascope version (Disc 1 of 2) of the 2005 DVD yields the best picture (on wide zoom). Sonically, however, the 1999 DVD sounds better than the 2005 DVD as well as the 2001 remastered audio CD. The sound of the '99 DVD, which had been given THX sound processing, is much more open, bright, and dynamic with clear highs. The sound of the '05 DVD, which really doesn't sound too bad, comes across very slightly muffled, as if it had a layer of gauze placed over it, unfortunately deadening the highs and restricting the openness. So if it's the best picture you're looking for, get the 50th Anniversary DVD. If you want the best sound, get the '99 DVD."
5,Great Movie great music!,Never get tired of Rogers and Hammerstein musicals and this is no exception.
5,Very Impressed,I received my product in a very timely manner and it was just as described. Very happy with my item
5,LOVE this movie!,I love OKLAHOMA the musical and I couldn't wait to see it when I bought it from amazon! Would HIGHLY recommend this!
3,Oklahoma,"This DVD is rated with a picture quality of 4 compared to Carousel with a picture quality of 3. I take strong exception to this and might want to give it a 2. Carousel was a much better picture quality. For example in the begiining of Oklahoma, when Curley is sing the ""Surrey with the Finge on Top"" you can see a target grid on his Red shirt as the image is panned. This is a very sloppy transfer even for non-anamorphic. I can only hope they will re-release it again in anamorphic format."
5,OKLAHOMA FOREVER,"As JUD ROD STEIGER overacts,some songs are missing from the original 1943 stage production ,but to tell you the truth nobody cares, because when GORDON MacRAE starts singing the magic stills operates after all these years. GLORIA GRAHAME was fantastic as ADO ANNIE and she really steals the show to all the others.SHIRLEY JONES in her first part was charming.Buy this film,you'll want to see it until you get to know all the songs by heart.Some AMERICAN institution are worth preserving and this is one of them."
2,I'm sticking with my Laserdisc.,"Like many people, I was looking forward to the 50th Anniversary Edition of OKLAHOMA! I was surprised to find the Todd-AO transfer to be a mess. Grainy, dark and muddy is the best way to describe the picture. I sincerely hope FOX will offer a recall on these discs.In the meantime, I will be watching my ten year old Laserdisc, also mastered from the Todd-AO print. Although not enhanced for a widescreen TV, this edition has excellent picture and sound.It is a small consolation that the second disc in the DVD set includes a great featurette on the difference between CinemaScope and Todd-AO. This features the use of a video process called ""Smilebox"" that simulates the curved screen used in the original Todd-AO releases. It also features the two short subjects made to show-off the Todd-AO process. For this reason alone, I'll rate this set 2 stars.Perhaps FOX will realize the errors of their ways and correct the problem with this DVD."
1,THE MIRACLE OF ... WHAT?,This is my first time in this forumI've seen the film of the 2nd disc and I found the copy...NOT ONLY BAD BUT UNNOTICEABLEAS A MIRACLE the last three fellows have seen the copy in good conditions. It is possible that FOX HOME VIDEO have changed and made new copies of the 2nd disc. If this is not true it is possible that they have discovered a fantastic ophtalmologist.I choose the first option.Are you so kind -via Fox- to inform us how to change the bad copies in order to have all the collection in good conditions ?YoursRR
3,Oklahoma in the Past,"I was disappointed because I thought I had a DVD, but missed the VHS on the item. It was cheap, so I got excited and bought it. When it came, I saw the box and knew why it was cheap. It was totally my fault, so can't blame the seller. I will be more careful next time. We don't own a VHS player, so it was a waste of money for me. I gave it to my church for a yard sale. It taught me a good lesson to pay attention."
2,Doesn't Stand Up With the Rest of Musicals,"I am a BIG fan of musicals. My favorite kind of movie is a musical from ""Easter Parade"" to ""My Fair Lady"" but I could not stand ""Oklahoma!"". I found it very boring with really nothing to uphold the plot. It's only worth viewing if you count some of the songs and dances. What got me the most was the plot. It was so annoying how they went back in forth. I was like just go out with him to the stupid dance!!! The other actress was equally annoying...(the one who wanted to marry the salesman) But, that's just my opinion."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD!,"I'm shocked - when I heard the fantastic Todd-AO print was being released, I expected a stunning DVD. As many others have noted, it is UNWATCHABLE! One of the worst transfers since DVDs were created.The Cinemascope version may be considered watchable by some, but it is nothing to crow about. It is just barely acceptable, and I gave the DVD away I was so disappointed.With Warner Home Video coming out with increasingly gorgeous transfers, and with people buying high-def TVs that magnify all the flaw of bad transfers, Fox had better get its act together!What a waste of money..."
1,Bad Seller,"I recieved a video from this seller. The video did not work. When I asked for a refund they told me they would only refund me if I removed my review, which wasn't bad but it did say the video did not work. I would rather that other buyers know that the movie didn't work than to recieve my refund. I think it is shady how I could only recieve my refund if I deleted my review. I would not do business with this seller again. I have copies of all email conversations with this seller if any one would like to see. Thank you!"
3,NICE DVD EDITION! NOT MY FAVORITE MUSICAL!,"I am watching most of the Rodger's and Hammerstein musicals for the first time and I started with ""The King And I"" which I really liked. ""Oklahoma"" was my second choice and I didn't like it as much. I hate to say it,but there was too much singing in this movie! I know it is a musical,but it seemed like a minute didn't go by without someone bursting into song. I also didn't think most of the songs were all that great! It was nice to see a young Shirley Jones in this beautiful looking film, but it just wasn't for me. If you are a fan I think this 50th anniversay edition is an excellent value with a very good transfer and many extras."
5,A centennial celebration!,"Oklahoma is celebrating it's 100th birthday and what better way to salute our great state than by showing ""Oklahoma!"" ! Using the 50th anniversary CD was just perfect. The sound and color were fantastic. Couldn't have asked for better!! The additional CD had extra ""goodies"" on it. We gave the CD collection away as a door prize so I know whoever won it has a treasure!"
2,Super singing - bad picture,"As many others have stated, the picture quality on this DVD is terrible, much worse than the other O & H musicals which Fox released in the same series. At times, it looks more like an MPEG movie than a DVD. Save your money until they bring out a restored ""collectors"" edition.Shame on you, Fox, for wasting people's money!"
5,I love Will Parker!,"Forget Curly! Will and Ado Annie are the best part of this show. Actually everybody did a great job. The songs are fantastic, the dancing amazing. I get hysterical everytime Laurie tells Judd to ""pack up his duds and scoot!"""
5,One word: Incredible,"In a nutshell, this is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. The songs ""Liberty"" and ""By the Sea"" are so earth moving... I can't even explain it... you just have to listen to it..."
3,Not near as good as Everything You Want,"I bought Everything You Want, and it is an excellent album. Therefor I then went on and bought this but was really disappointed. This is NOT a rock album but folky stuff, reminded me a lot of Christy Moore. I know the band's line-up has changed since this album and so also the sound. They are now in the studio making a new album which I'm awaiting with great interest! But if you want great rock now, go and buy Train's first album."
4,Enjoyable,This is good video game music when I played the retro-pacman joystick. Follow the hollow use to make me get many levels in pac-man. I like the music it has good chorusing and can be memorable and enjoyable. The alternate style following with sometimes very heavy bursts of short heavy guitar playing gives a leveling in my mind. Kind of like punching your brother but still eating your favorite meal along side him hours later.
5,Amazing Album,"Soilwork is an awesome band. This album is just amazing. Great melodies, fist pumping choruses, ripping guitar solos, and solid drumming. Speed's vocals really shine. Highlights include: Follow The Hollow (great chorus, killer solo), Flameout, Mercury Shadow, Soilworker's Song Of The Damned, Black Star Deciever, As We Speak, and Natural Born Chaos. A great all around metal album, get this now."
5,So pissed that I wanted to stab myself like I did everytime I listened to the first two cd's!!!!,"I get increasingly pissed when people always complain about how bands add a few slow parts to their cd's. Waahhh, you talk about this music being whinny when all you do is whine about bands that like to be more spontaneous. Whether you all believe it or not, this is a very good cd, and there aren't very many cd's (if any) out there that sound like this one.So go listen to the first two Soilwork cd's and cry like you do about all the new rock music that comes out on the radio now days. Me, I'll just enjoy music that sounds good to me, even if it's a damn Hannah Montana song."
4,New To The Soilwork Camp,"Just wanted to drop a quick review in here. I generally don't have leanings towards to death metal side of the metal scene but Soilwork has to be the exception. As a matter-of-fact I generally lean towrds power and ""true"" metal. Recently I have gotten back into a powerlifting career and power metal just wasn't bringing out the pure agression necessary to get that ""contolled insanity"" going for a big lift. Enter Soilwork via a few younger guys at the gym (they're 20, I'm 35). Needless to say, as any Soilwork fan will tell you, I'm blown away by the intensity and melodic portions of this album. The last time I was this freaked by an album was 1992...the album?...Vulger Display of Power from Pantera."
2,A little unimpressed,"i got this cd because i had heard that Soilwork were alot like In Flames and Dark Tranquility etc. and that they're really good. it was the only one on the shelf by Soilwork so i said what the hell i'll give it a try. i have to say i was VERY unimpressed, the singer at times sounded just flat out stupid, and the music sounded just plain POPPY at times. that's not to say that every song was bad on the cd, there were 2 or 3 pretty good songs. one thing i'll give these guys is that even though the guitar solos were pretty scarce on here, the axemen have skill. i wouldn't recommend this cd for your first Soilwork album, because this was my first soilwork album and it really gave me a bad impression on this band. i guess it's just a matter of taste...it came off kind of industrial or something, i don't really dig that kind of style but i can see why others do."
3,Deathmetal Elevator music,"Its just there. Its not bad but nothing grabs you. Its kinda like a guy with no teeth, he just has no bite. Get King's Evil ""Deletion of Humanoise"" that album hits you in the head like a brick."
3,A bit disappointed,"I was curious to see if Soilwork could actually top Predator's Portrait, one of my favorite albums of all time, and upon seeing Devin Townsend as the producer I was tempted to think Natural Born Chaos would actually surpass it ... I even ran (literally, 30 blocks) to buy it the minute I heard it had come out. I've only listened to the whole thing once ... but I'm gonna have to say No, it's not as good. The opening track is incredible but the rest of the album sounds like they took the most boring few moments from Predator's Portrait and turned them into full length songs, which are well produced but lack the energy and aggression of the previous albums. On the other hand, it's still Soilwork, it has Devin Townsend in it, and I can actually understand almost everything he says on this album,...so I'm gonna tell myself it's awesome and keep listening to it. It'll probably grow on me!"
3,Solid album but....,"this is a solid album but if you are a long time fan of soilwork(like me) then you will have found the clean vocals profoundly annoying. Speed had a much better vocal performance on A Predator's Portrait and The Chainheart Machine. Some high-lights of the CD are ""Follow the Hollow"", ""As We Speak"", and ""Soilworker's song of the damned"". Otherwise, a lot of the songs are just plain average."
2,Ick!!!...What happened?,"A new trend has been occuring where good old swedish metal bands are going sour. Like In Flames latest release ""Reroute to Remain"" Soilwork is experimenting with clean lyrics. It almost sounds like a desperate attempt to go mainstream. I am discusted with this release. The old Swedish melodic powerhouse, Soilwork, has gone soft. What happened to the fast riffs and dazzling melodies? The 21st century is a sad era for metal, with bands like In Flames and Arch enemy loosing touch with their old Swedish melodic style. If you do like good music I suggest you check out Soilwork's older stuff like ""Steelbath Suicide"" or ""The Chainheart Machine""...I even would suggest ""A Predator's Portrait"" despite the few clean lyrics, because unlike ""Natural Born Chaos"" they still stay true to their older style and pump out fast paced, outstanding melodies. Well thats all I have to say about this abomination. Sigh..."
1,Garbage,"What happened to this great band? Steelbath Suicide and Chainheart Machine were so aggressive, and everything was an adrenaline rush. It was intense. It made you want to shout along and move.This record however, was like the newer In Flames-- you want to jump up and down and scream about your parents and maybe even cry during the set. I don't care if they are trying to sell out or not, this music is just bland, boring, and even annoying. Don't try to sing when you're a screamer. Shoot down this review all you want, I know it sucks, but hey, sucky review for an even suckier CD. This was a waste of my time and I'm glad I was able to make some profit selling it to some kid who told me it sucked too."
5,The standard by which all other Soilwork albums are judged...,"There are quite a few killer melodic death metal albums out there, but the inescapable album that surfaces time and time again when we revisit the genre has to be ""Natural Born Chaos"". Soilwork put out an album in 2002 that was quite simply, brilliant! We find the Swede's in peak form creatively and what we encounter is an immersive juggernaut that is both beautiful and aggressive. It is one of those few albums that demands a dedicated listening by screaming ""drop everything!"", and no wonder, it is produced by none other than the musical madman genius Devin Townsend. This melodic masterpiece always leaves me wanting more. Killer cuts?...every...single...track! 5 star super madness! Undeniable in its intensity and if you enjoy a nice single malt scotch now and then, this is what single malt music tastes like, complex, intelligent, smooth and yet full of fire... enjoy!"
4,Jello does it again,"There is just too much material for this guy out there, he can't resist! This is his 7th spoken word album. It cover mostly current events, politics, etc. with a neat clip at the end about Joey Ramone. I have his other albums, and if you don't, you'll probably get a bit more out of this album than I did. He tends to reuse certain things a bit, but was enough new stuff to be worth the money. Its a good second opinion about what is going on in the world today, and makes one think about the ""what ifs?"" in this day in age. If you want more of his creative writing stuff, ""No More Cocoons"" and ""I Blow Minds for a Living"" are definitly the way to go."
5,GET THIS,"IF YOU LIKE MICHAEL MOORE AND RALPH NADER, THEN GET THISTruly awesome, fuels my distaste for what's going on right now and for what looks like it will be happening very soon. jello for president."
4,Post 9/11 Jello!,"I decided to give this a listen since I haven't heard from Jello since the 2000 election. Some of it's interesting, some questionable, some obvious to us now, some interesting predictions (especially about Iraq), and some nice information about Al Gore and why people didn't want to vote for him. Most of all, it's very, very funny. Well worth picking up if you're into this kind of thing, or if you've liked his other spoken word albums"
3,Factory re-furb DW Circ saw,Received in good (like new) condition. Performed as expected. I am satisfied with a good buy
3,Average quality.,"I wouldn't recommend this pellet for speed loaders (for repeaters,) it will jammed. This is an economy pellet for beginners and single fed pistols or rifles. I've also use it in manual 5 shot clips for the Crosman 760 and other 5 shot manual clips with no issue.mgso"
3,Buyer Beware,Only buy this if you are a die hard fan or want a cheap product. The videos are OK but the concert sound is terrible. You have to blast your TV set and even then it doesnt sound very good. Muddy. I would recommend looking elsewhere unless you need this for your collection or are only into OLD Anathema stuff.
4,A call not commonly heard,"This story will seem very, very strange to most contemporary folk. The call that this American girl heard, the call to a form of hermitism, is not commonly discerned these days. This woman, this professionally trained musician, believed that God called her to total reclusion. After unsuccessful attempts in the Carmelite order, she finally found her place among the Camaldolese nuns of the convent of St. Antony in the Desert in Rome. There she lived in seclusion, even from the nuns, for 45 years. Why? Read this book if you want an interesting look at this woman who stands as a challenge to our modern values."
1,Didn't work,"This product was very dry, it seemed old and really did not work at all, I do not recommend, waste of money"
5,Secret War - Another Excellent Page-Turner,"Malensek's sophomore effort not only shows the continued growth of this young and talented author, but hits another out of the park homerun with a storyline ripped straight from today's headlines, believable characters, and a pace that won't let you put the book down.Scott's prose is reminiscent of a young Clancy (back when he wasn't getting paid by the word). He spices his narratives with just enough technical and military information to keep readers without these backgrounds aware, informed, and interested, but does not take it to the extreme of bogging down, like so many tech-thriller writers of today.His work is easy to read, flows well, and carries the reader along at a rate that will leave one looking for more when the last page is reached. An excellent yarn, both relevant and eye-opening. This writer is one to expect great things from in the future."
2,Was there an editor?,"This book is OK, as long as you can overlook the errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation."
5,great product,this is a great product that will last you years hi quality fabriqe and construction and tru to mill specifications
3,"nice rainfall shower, but wimpy 'pulsating' massage","If the massage feature is important to you, you won't be happy with this shower head.It has a pretty good rainfall type shower and it's nice to have the option to switch to a center spray. But, the 'pulsating' massage feature is pretty wimpy. It's not nearly as good as other WaterPik shower heads that I've used. I removed the flow restricter from the shower head and that didn't help much.The shower head is lightweight plastic with a metal-like coating.The adjustable extension arm and associated hardware is very good quality chrome plated solid brass. (That's why I gave it 3 stars).I am now using my old Moen shower head with the WaterPik extension arm."
3,shower head too large,"although the item is nice, the shower head of 8"" is extremely large, larger than imagined."
1,Adjustable arm shower head,"I tried to use with diverter valve, but unbalanced torque created havoc with sealing gaskets.That's why helicopters have two rotors."
3,Shower head with a leak.,This is a great shower head but there is a leak on the arm adjustment. Wish I bought it in the store now!!!!! Then I could get a return.
1,"Waterpik ASD 833, AquaScape Spa Showerhead","The product is much bigger than the photo indicates. It arrived with a rattle, and I had to take it apart to make the small repair. Compared with more quality brands, I thought it inferior. It didn't feel solid and it was difficult to change the spray adjustments. I bought a Moen showerhead and used the arm that came with the Waterpik."
2,Be weary,"Be careful with this. I installed the shower head with a adjustable wrench and did not over tighten the head as I used tfe paste instead of Teflon tape. Next morning my girlfriend tells me the shower head is leaking. I looked at it and there was a Hairline crack on this special part waterpik uses. There is this removable part that comes off the arm of this shower head and you can't find a replacement anywhere. Even waterpik customer service never got back to me. The part is so thin and poorly manufactured it's almost as if they want it to break on you so you purchase a new shower head from them. I managed to ""acquire"" a replacement part the hard way instead of loosing $70 after one shower. Move on and buy something worthwhile. Waterpik sucks."
2,A Disappointment.,"How can this CD be titled as DC' Best without a single song by ""The Godfather"" of Go-Go, Chuck Brown? In this CD, the only song that is true to the essence of Go-Go is ""Practice Makes Perfect"" by Lil' Benny. Don't be fooled by the misleading title of this CD."
2,Not so much,"This light holster held a lot of promise, especially given Surfire's reputation. Unfortunately, in less than two months the internal metal completely broke leaving me with a useless piece of plastic. It was a great holster in those two months, but now I have to spend more money for another new holster."
4,Deployable product,"Pros:I purchased this product as a primary light source as an alternative for a weapons mounted light. I placed the holster on the front of my Sam Brown within easy draw/reach for my weak hand. You can easily draw the light from this holster and move quickly into the Weaver without any difficulty. Draw is smooth and simple and holstering light is just as easy. Seems to be well constucted and should be durable/deployable for a few years.Cons: Price should be reduced by at least $5.00. Flashlight sits a little high when used lamp down. Lamp down is a nice sleek fit. Lamp up draw is similar to the draw of a fresh mag in that you have to pinch grip and then rotate to deploy.UPDATE!!!Its now April 2011 and have been wearing product in the field under many circumstances. Have been an LE for 20 years and this is the most tactically sound way I've deployed a light. Quick out of the holster, easy to re holster. Strong product."
2,Almost,"I love Surfire products!!! So, I bought this holster for my duty belt. Was great for about six or seven months. Then the light would get stuck. After this happened a number of times, the metal clip inside the holster broke. Now it won't hold the light. I know the light can be put in the other way, but that feels like I could loose it. Twenty-five bucks is a little high to just go get another one. The light is awesome!!"
4,good overall but needs some redesign,"the holster works great but since the clamp and flash light are made from the ame material, it really scratches up the light. but other than that is works great."
5,Best back-up holster!!!,"I am a police officer and I use this holster with my SureFire flashlight. I keep it on my work rig, right on the right hip as a crossdraw (I am right handed) for my weak hand. I use this as a back-up, or daytime light when I don't have my Mag-Lite. The size is amazingly small, and considering the punch my SureFire light packs, is the best money can buy. It secures the light via an internal metal tension clip, and is super secure. you could hang it upside down and pound on it, but the light is not coming out. It is also insanely rugged. This is the best small or back-up flashlight holster out there."
3,Surefire 6P LED in the Rugged Polymer Speed Holster aka V70,"This is supposed to be a speed holster yet it holds the flashlight way too snuggly no matter which end you insert this light. It is so snug that it gouged/scraped off the ""6P"" painted on my light and created a burr in the aluminum case of the flashlight. Fortunately removing the burr was easy enough, but the flashlight is defaced without a good story to tell. You're supposed to be able to insert the flashlight in either way, but only bezel side down stands a chance of a quick draw of my Surefire 6P LED. Otherwise, it's fine."
4,"Great flashlight holster, but not for a refined look!","The V70 is a great speed holster for law enforcement purposes if you wish to have a bezel down holster. This allows for you to draw your firearm with your strong hand and draw your flashlight with your support hand at the same time. If you are not concerned about having a speed holster, then a leather or nylon traditional holster may be a better option. The major drawback to this product is that the plastic is molded and not polished to a finish. Therefore the plastic is not a true black, but rather a faded black, almost grey color. If you are looking for a more uniform look, definitely go with a leather holster."
3,NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!!,"I love SureFire flashlights. I own at least 5 or 6 G2's, and they are great.SureFire products are expensive but the quality is worth the extra bucks, at least for the flashlights.I just purchased the V70 holster, and I am very disappointed. As one of the other reviews stated the color of the plastic is not black, but a dull gray color. For the cost of this holder I was expecting a little more.This holder is really nothing but a plastic cup with a cheap metal retention clip.I would have been better off buying the Bianchi 7326 AccuMold holster or far less money."
1,Do not buy!,"The V70 metal retention clip inside the holster strips the paint and texture off a Surefire 6P. After using the V70 holster a few times, the texture and paint on the tail cap was stripped clean. Poor design and a good way to put years of wear on your nice new light in only a few minutes. Do not buy!"
4,Works great,This works great for my Surefire G2 flashlight. VERY sturdy construction. A bit pricey though. I would probably buy it again.
5,Great for the duty belt,"I've been a police officer for over 12 years so I've had a lot of different supplemental lights on my belt. The new Surefire PX2 Fury is the brightest light I've ever had. To complement the light I added this holster for my belt. The light is extremely secure in the holster and I have no fear of loosing the light while running or bending over to search under a car or something. The only complaint with this holster is that when you seat the light fully there is some noise, which isn't the best for tactical noise discipline."
1,Not thought out properly,"I selected this rating because I found this item was too cumbersome and bulky. I also did not like the exterior texture. There was nothing I liked about this product.Would I recommend it to someone else? It's hard to say. That would depend on what field they wanted to put it to use in. I however, would not purchase it again."
1,Not worth your money,"This is the BIGGEST book of cliches I've EVER SEEN (well...next to Eragon, an even worse book)! The storyline is rock-solid awful, and I could pull better writing outta my SPHINCTER! Sure, some retarded 11-year-old wrote it, but...SO WHAT? The only publishing company that would actually WANT to publish such an awful book would be First Books, a publishing company where you have to PAY to get your book published. So, it's not that amazing that a retarded lil' 11-year-old wrote this. Remember: Will Bennett needs to DIE!"
1,"interesting, but not all that it is cracked up to be...","Though an interesting read, the book lacked an essential plot and the conclusion was unsatisfying. While the 11-year old author is receiving many congradulations on his achievement I believe it should be noticed that this was published by first books, which is a publishing agency that requires you to pay for your book to be published."

3,Interesting.,"Like all the other Elm Quilt books, I enjoyed this one too. I didn't enjoy it as much as the others I've read. It was a bit of a slower read, but the history of how quilt were used during the Underground Railroad is fascinating. There is a lot of discussion as to whether or not this is true, but the author is very clear that this book is her interpretation of how quilts could have been used to assist runaway slaves.I liked the aspect of how Sylvia reads her ancestor's journal to find out what happened in her family. The way the journal is intercut with Sylvia's daily life is interesting."
5,A Wonderful Novel!,"I've been a fan of Jennifer's since The Quilter's Apprentice, but this is definitely the best book yet in the series! A fantastically engrossing story will keep you reading all night. Very entertaining for anyone who like a great story -- not just quilters and Civil War enthusiasts."
4,"Slow beginning, but worth it in the end.","It was a wonderful story line involving the healing of bitterness of Silvia and her family history and the underground railroad. Although it never resolves the issues of why certain quilts were used or if they were used for the underground railroad, it left the reader satisfied with the conclusion. A worthwhile read especially if you've read her other books."
5,didn't wanna put it down!!,"this was definitely ms. chiaverini's best effort so far! i was really interested to find out what sylvia found out about her ancestor's and their past. i have to agree with another reviewer that it seemed unlikely anyone with such a journal would spend all summer reading it. i would have done nothing else until that journal was read! but, hey, this is fiction, so i'll allow it!i have enjoyed reading all jennifer chiaverini's books and am impatiently awaiting the next one/s!!!"
4,A good book--very interesting,"I am not a quilter, but I am a history buff. I picked this book up because it sounded really interesting. I was not disappointed. There is lots to this story that I probably could understand better if I would read the other books in the series, which I probably will.Sylvia finds some old quilts in an ancestor's hope chest, along with a journal. The journal displays her ancestor's in a different light than what Sylvia was brought up to believe. This makes it very interesting. There is even a mystery that isn't solved at the end of the book--which leads to the question everyone asks at one point in their life--who am I?Sylvia learns to trust her instincts and understand that it's not what you are percieved, but how you percieve yourself.An interesting, enjoyable book that I would recommend."
5,Underground Railway,"I liked reading this novel featuring the contribution of quilts and quilting to the Underground Railroad, written from the perspective of a runaway slave."
1,The runaway quilt,The book was in badshape bent & worn will be more careful in the future in ordering --love the book itself
4,Amazing,"While there are individual stories in each of the Elm Creek Quilters books there is also some American history. Very interesting re the negro slaves and how some wanted to help them others only wanted them captured and either punished or returned to their ""owner"" for more bad treatment such as rape etc.I am working through all of the ECQ series and totally enjoying them"
5,Lives pieced together into a masterpiece,"I have to fully agree with Shirley Leib's assessment of this wonderful book. I just finished it, and I too, could not put it down. There are few books written so passionatley that they have reduced me to tears. This book, however, brings the reader right to the heart of its characters. Let's just say, more than one tissue was required in the final chapters of this story.I am anxious to get to the library on Monday so I can check out another of Jennifer Chiaverini's books. I can think of several people who will be getting this book from me at Christmas!"
5,It was hard to put this book down - such a pageturner!!!,The story weaves pre-Civil War and present. The Underground Railroad gets a connection with Elm Creek and the journal entries from Gerda tell a beautiful story.Sylvia Compton learns heaps about her family's legacy in this book. This book will move you beyond emotions and stay with you long after you close the book.
3,"A Good Start, But Biased","The Organic Food Guide is a good starting point for someone interested in organic food, and it's a quick read. However, I feel that it does not go very in depth on the subject. It also seems somewhat biased, proclaiming only the (sometimes undocumented) benefits of organic food. Also, the pictures left a bit to be desired, as most were of poultry/egg farms. The cost-comparison chart included showed organic foods to cost the same as, or only slightly more than, conventional products, which, as any shopper could attest, is inaccurate."
5,WOW - NEED I SAY MORE!!! :),"WOW - that's really what it comes down to. These speakers are absolutly the best. They have rich, deep, and powerful bass, while still having great sound. These sound almost like a mini -BOSE home theater system. They sound better than all of the 5 piece computer speaker sets combined! The price is also VERY good. I mean for $$$ bucks, how could you go wrong? The BEST, highly recomended speakers. I have had this speakers for about 2 months, and have tryed them on every device that I have in the house. From my Compaq 1800T notebook computer, to my Compaq iPAQ 3955, to my Sony TV and Mini-system, to my XBOX, these speakers sound awesome. This rating should be 10 out of 5 stars! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK BOSE!!!!!!!!"
2,You can buy much better for less money.....,"My main problem with Bose speakers in general is that they ""color"" the sound quite a bit. The whole ""Proprietary spaciousness-enhancing circuitry"", in my opinion takes away much of the clarity of the sound. In my opinion, most of the people who wrote reviews here really do not know much about speakers, because Bose have a horrible reputation with audiophiles.I owned and returned these speakers. They are not horrible mind you, but you could do MUCH better for less money. If anyone is thinking about buying these, do yourself a favor and try the Cambridge SoundWorks ""SoundWorks"" 3 piece system first. They absolutely blow the Bose speakers away and retail for $69."
1,Go with Klipsch,"Klipsch speakers just sound better in every way. I have owned both kinds. I just got rid of my Bose MediaMate because the sound quality does NOT compare. I read in PC mag that the Klipsch promedia sound so good ""that its almost sickening"". They didnt want to comment on the Bose, they dont even get a consideration! Please, take it from someone who has owned both kinds of quality computer speakers. GO WITH KLIPSCH and leave Bose speakers to those who dont care that much!"
4,I wouldnt compare this to Xzibit,I am A big Secular Rap Fan. I listen to rappers like Xzibit Pac Jay Z And much more. Im sorry to say this but i Dont think the beats on this CD can match up to the secular rapper of today. The bottom line is this: If your a Secular rap fan like me Avoid this CD But if you just wanna hear people prasin the lord in the form of Rap then Buy this CD. The Only reason I gave this CD 4 stars is because of I like the way they flow But that doesnt make up for the beats. There lyrics do hit the spot But the beats misses the target. To the Secular Rap folk out there look somewhere eles like Gospel Gangstas.
1,read this before purchase,"it's great documentary on Aril's life, but it's just the same of ""skater girl"", i bought the two dvds and i have two copies.."
5,Love it..,"There arent many books that I agree wth more than 90 pct of, but this is one of them. Seth does a great job of presenting exactly what every executive must understand in order to compete in business today.Every CEO or businessperson has to put their own business in context of the world around them . Seth makes it clear that no business, no matter how successful or incumbent in their industry is in a vacuum and when its your business you better realize that if you dont zoom above the best, you fall with the rest :)...I go back to this book often as a reminder to keep on pushing myself to be a ""zoomer"" and let those around me be the same. I not only recommend it to friends, I have already sent a few copies to my buddies at the NBA..Congrats on a great book Sethm"
1,The bar may just be too high.,"I like books that don't require learning an imaginary language. Reading Sartre once was enough. I like books that don't require quantum leaps of logic. I like books that don't require a complete suspension of my system of disbelief. I like books that I that I can finish. I didn't like this book.Looking for philosophical business thought from science? See ""Leadership and the New Science: Discovering Order in a Chaotic World Revised"" by Margaret J. Wheatley"
4,INTERESTNG WITH THE DARWIN TWIST.,"After reading ""Unleashing the Idea virus"" I got the idea that Seth Godin wasn't the typical business author but now that I have just finished reading ""Survival Is Not Enough: Zooming, Evolution, and the Future of Your Company"" I am sure that he is totally different from the rest... Does that make him better than the rest?... I still haven't made up my Mind!I really enjoyed reading about business topics with a mix of Darwin's theories; It really opened my mind about certain similarities of both Science and Business. A lot of the writing of Seth Godin is so simple that can be considered brilliant.Now, if someone asks me if what Godin wrote in this book will help me in Business I really wouldn't know what to answer on that specific question but I would say: DON'T EXPECT TO GET ALL THE BUSINESS SECRETS TO BE SUCCESSFUL JUST EXPECT TO GET REALLY COOL IDEAS, STATS AND A GREAT RELATION BETWEEN SCIENCE (Darwin) AND BUSINESS (Godin)."
4,Funny!,"Lynne Truss is a very intelligent, hysterically funny writer. Expect loads of amusing sarcasm and many many laughs reading the columns and short novels in this book."
1,The Lynn Truss Treasury,"After reading EATS SHOOTS and LEAVES, I was anxious to read these three comic novels by Lynn Truss. She goes from being hilariously funny to going on and on like someone detached from reality. With only the first of these ""comic novels"" to pass judgment upon, I would be sure that this author is schizophrenic; or, at least schizoid. I'm disappointed in Ms. Truss and would not recommend this ""Treasury"" to anyone. Eats Shoots and Leaves is a classic which any and all ""wordsmiths"" appreciate."
5,History Made Fascinating!,"This is the kind of reference book that would have made those boring college courses more than bearable. And its quirky ""take"" on American pop culture serves as a useful complement to Ken Burns, ""American Experience"" and ""Antiques Roadshow."" Are you listening, PBS?"
5,"Smart, witty, wonderful","Poplorica was an absolute delight. History, sociology, psychology all rolled into one. I'm a fiction reader so when a nonfiction book holds my interest page after page that's incredible. Not only did I love the writing - witty, smart, always on target - but the authors went above and beyond by providing additional sources of information. Poplorica is on my list for father's day and graduation gifts."
2,Only somewhat interesting,"I sort of felt like the authors of this book put a whole bunch of ideas in a hat they liked and picked them out. It makes for an interesting (usually) mish-mash of stories about why things are the way they are in America. Touching on topics from America's obsessions with lawns to how air conditioning has affected politics, there are some interesting entries here to read just because you're an American. Other chapters seem like they are more geared to people with a specific interest (and written as if they are too, I was totally lost during the guitar chapter). Worth a look I guess."
5,Metal Monsters,"Too cool!! I liked this one. My grandson sat as quietly as I have ever seen him and when it was over pressed the button to repeat and repeat. This set of "" totally trucks "" dvds is over the top. Thanks to whoever made them."
4,son really enjoys the metal monsters,"Lots of action and big machines munching on old cars, we had many discussions later and he reinacts some of the scenes in playtime."
2,Uninspired,"Sandra Betzina is wonderfully talented when it comes to garment contstruction. I have several of her books and love them. However, her expertise and creativity do not seem to extend to home sewing. The projects in this book are not inspiring. The fabric choices are questionable. It is difficult to glean the 'tricks of the trade' as this book is organized entirely by project, not technique. Save your money. If you are truly interested, check it out from the library before you invest in this publication."
1,Weak Content,"Unlike other reviews, I am disappointed with this book which I bought based on the hype of other reviewers! ... And the writing style is cheesy, spouting-off some loosely defined quality terms in attempt to add some technical merit to subject matter. Having read the book (forced myself to stay the course), I can honestly say I took-away nothing of value.Skip the book. ..."
5,The Basics of Performance Measurement,This book serves as the perfect introduction to the core aspects of performance measurement. In clear and in simple english it describes various types of performance measurements providing you the ground floor understanding of how get from point A to point B. The book contains examples of many types of performance measurements and charts. It also explains how to create effective performance measures. The five-step method for developing a performance measurement system is very helpful as a starting point for organizations implementing new beginnings.
3,Small Book -- Good Content,"I was disappointed when I saw the book. It's much smaller and thinner than I expected. The content is good, but it's not extensive. It's easy to read and a good reference book, but it wasn't what I was looking for."
4,Elixir guitar strings.,"I would say that these strings are slightly overrated for the sound they produce. Though they last long and sound nice, I feel I can get an equal if not better tone out of a pack of Martin Phosphor bronze strings."
2,Long lasting?,After putting these string on about 16 days ago and playing maybe around 10 of those 16 days. The G-string broke while trying to tune down a step. EXTREMELY p****d off and don't think ill be buying this junk again. Long lasting? Could have fooled me.
5,Best strings on the planet,"These strings sound great, play great, and the coating really does keep down the squeaking. Some purists don't like the coating movement when it comes to strings, and it does take a micron off the treble, but they last a loooong time. I usually only have to change my strings once a month. I use them on my Washburn acoustic guitar, and play rock, folk, and country strumming. They rock, and I feel they are the best strings around today, period. These strings are very small, and are great for playing for long periods of time, without brutalizing the fingertips. Some people say the real light strings are not good for recording, and you probably have less of a bass boom, but I like 'em."
5,Great strings,"I got these for my dad for christmas. He loves them. He's been a musician for about 50 years and says that these are the best strings you can get. If he's happy with them, I'm happy with them."
4,"Polyweb, Not Nanoweb","Although the title of this item says ""Nanoweb"", the picture and the item I received were ""Polyweb"". Now that I have had both kinds, I will say that they are both great strings and I will continue buying Elixir - however, the Polyweb strings are a lot harder on my fingers than the Nanoweb, almost to the point of not wanting to use the guitar as often. Unfortunately I bought two sets so it looks like I will be learning to deal with it ;)"
5,USB cable for the Philips GoGear 6gb player,"I've had the philips gogear since 07' and my wire was left on a flight I was in...now after 3yrs I'm finally able to get a replacement wire.They delivered it about 3 days earlier then I was expecting so that was helpful. It works as advertised, so all in all great product!"
4,Great for anyone who served in WWII or who has relatives who did...,"Black, White and Gold may be fiction, but it reads much like a memoir, full of evocative detail that brings to life such disparate locales as San Francisco, Honolulu and below-decks in a US Navy vessel, all during World War II.This reader is not particularly a war fiction buff, nor does she know much about the Navy, ships or boats. Nonetheless, she found herself drawn into the story, not so much for the characterizations (although there is a pleasant whiff of ""Mr. Roberts"" about the book), but for the details of time, place and shipboard life that vibrate with their veracity.Definitely a book for anyone with an interest in the War in the South Pacific, naval life, wartime years, etc. This would make a great gift to a father or grandad who served in the Navy or Merchant Marines and to anyone serving now."
5,Just what we wanted.,"Great shape for a used book. Tells the whole story of Wright's activities in Oak Park, Il. Read it already"
1,Very good puzzle. My husband enjoyed it. Thanks,During the winter it is hard to find things to do and this puzzle was very nice and arrived in record time. It was packaged well and the price was ok.
5,Awesome Truths,This book is loaded with golden nuggets of truth. If you are searching for answers this is a great book to start with.
3,"Three and a half stars, but not quite four","Well, in my opinion Love For Sale is absolutely horrendous--and somehow in godawful taste too. Which probably means that, in some ways, I don't really like HER all that much...Or, if that's what and how she sings in English even SOME of the time, she should never sing in English! However, Physique et Sans Issue, Le Moi et Le Je, and Fuir Le Bonheur de Peur Que go a long way towards dispelling the bad impression And, of course, even Jane B., among some, but not all, others."
4,First time thong,I tried a couple of thongs and found this one to be the best of those I tried. Strap in back was not comfortable on other brand and this brand was. Pouch on this was comfortable also.
3,an adventure in innocence,"Pandy, in his good-heartedness,feeds a hungry bird on his windowsill. When he runs out of corn and starts feeling sorry for the poor bird, he discovers it was not the same bird each time, but many birds who all looked the same. The pictures are very simple and it is a cute story with a surprise ending that should delight little children."
5,Enlightening book !,"Being a new mom and managing a high stress career, Lisa Belkins' book was very eye opening for me. There are several times when I wonder how I can have the energy and motivation to keep this lifestyle going long term, and how long I will survive in the professional world while being a good mother to my child .Lisa Belkin gave me a peep into the future and opened options that I knew only vaguely about. Very well written and enjoyable as well."
1,As hollow and self-promoting as her column.,"A big, ineffective, cold rationalization. ""Unbalanced"" is putting it kindly.This is one long ego trip by someone whose priority is clearly her self and her career, NOT her children. It's hard to see that she ever compromises her own wants (and they are wants not needs) for her kids' benefit.Do your family a favor; sit down on the floor with with an play or talk for a few hours throughout the week -- or read with them -- instead of reading this. Ms. Belkin should try it too."
4,Not Just for Working Moms,"I read this book after it was the closing feature on Oprah and thought I would give it a try. I am a working woman, married, no children, and I thought this book might be too much about getting the balance as a parent. I was pleasantly surprised that much of what was written applies to ANYONE who is working, especially working women. And her message - that 100% balance is impossible and you need to figure out what works for you - is an important one. The stories were funny, short (which is her concession to people with no time) and relevant. I would recommned this as a good, quick read to anyone who is trying to figure out how to ""make it work""."
2,"Fantasy--she doesn't have to work -- and doesn't ""get it.""","How nice that Lisa Belkin, married to a wealthy doctor, can ""decide"" whether or not to work. I wonder what she would be writing if she HAD to get up every day, drop the kids off at daycare, rush to the office to get in before her boss drops by her office, then do the mad dash all over again at the end of the day before the daycare closes. She can talk about taking ""breaks"" from work and people going to Bali, but clearly her reason to work has nothing to do with having to pay a mortgage. Read this only if you can identify with affluent couples where the wife's paycheck is just ""mad money."""
3,where's the beef?,"If you already know Lisa Belkin's column, this book is for you. As a compilation book of previous columns, it's a quick romp through balancing work and life and, at times, parenthood. However, after ten or so essays, you feel stuck in the 850-word column world and are left wanting more. I would have loved her to expand each ""story"" for the book form and add more meat to it."
4,Sexy pair of boots!,"This is actually my first pair of thigh high boots, but certainly not the last. Really good quality. Soft leather. doesn't look cheap. I would like a pointier toe, but for the price, you can't beat this with a bat. I'm going to order the brown pair as well! If you're hesitating, don't. Just get them, you won't be disappointed. they fit my leg wonderfully with or without jeans."
1,Poor Qulity Product/Service,"I returned my thigh high boots cos the boot portion fit well but the ankle was not fitting.. so when i returned the item. They charged me a 15% re stocking fee, when it just didn't fit right and refused to refund it. The Quality of the shoe is poor they where hooker boots not stylishly made thigh highs.. which are in fashion now. I do not recommend this store. Victoria Secret doesn't charge you restocking fee.. nor does any other shoe store.. i think these ppl think they are Harrods or something."
5,Practical Introduction,I am working in a respected company as a board member.With this book you can get back to the basics again. The book is easy to understand and containing topics which are practically applicable. If you want more detail it will help you by providing references to the other books too.If you want to get back to the basics I recommend it.
5,THE BEST BUSINESS BOOK EVER!!!,"IT DOESN'T MATTER WETHER YOUR JUST BEGINNING TO MANAGE OR HAVE YEARS AT IT (LIKE I DO) MANAGING FOR DUMMIES IS A TREMENDOUS EYE OPENER. FINALLY A BOOK THAT IS WORTH READING AND KEEPING AS A CONTINUOS REFERENCE. IT APPROACHES THE BASICS, THE FOUNDATIONS, IT'S NOT A FAD. COMPANIES SHOULD MAKE ALL THEIR MANAGERS READ IT (AND THEN TEST THEM ON IT)."
5,Excellent book ever seen on server side javascript,"If any one wanted to learn good SSJS programming techniques, this is the best buy. Authors not only have real stuff but they explained in a much better way than anyother about SSJS concepts with wonderful, real life examples. Ofcourse, you shoud know about javascript fundamentals (core javascript) before you read this book and authors are very specific about the content of the book and their target is only for users of SSJS"
5,Helps overcome the steep SSJS learning curve.,"This book helps overcome the steep learning curve associated with SSJS, providing excellent code examples and explanations. Many of the code examples can be easily and quickly modified to provide real-world capabilities."
1,Take a deep breath... hold your nose... it still stinks!,"This 'film' is so bad it is absolutely impossible to think that it was not deliberately made as such... EVERYTHING is wrong - acting, direction, storyline, photography, music, the people that did the catering for the cast... you name it!! Incredibly painful to sit thru' - A REAL STINKER (and not in the 'good way'.) As usual if you see the words 'YORK ENTERTAINMENT' on the box... BEWARE!!! You have been warned..."
4,An English Assignment is a Review on Amazon,"This fictional story is between 2 strangers that fall in love over a time. Even though the other characters within this story could not make their own minds wrap around the idea that Katie and Bear are desperately in love. But overall I found this story very entertaining and full of romance, betrayal,animals, death, and sadness. The thing that also kept me flipping through the pages is the detail that filled my mind full of wonder on what will happen on the next sentence, page ,and even chapter.Thanks for your time."
5,Good Book,"Someone gave me this book,years ago, knowing that I didn't read much, but told me I'd read this one. And I did. This is such a good story, especially if you're animal-oriented. I gave the book away, so somebody else could read it. Then, I knew somebody I thought would love it, too, so I ordered it off Amazon. Get this book. You won't regret it."
5,What a wonderful read!,"I was unable to put this book down and read it in a single day. It's a great read, describing the love between two seemingly polar opposites. I truly fell in love with Bear and the other characters like the vet and even the animals. Like one reviewer said, I'll never look at animals the same way again. Beautiful love story with a sad, yet touching ending. I suggest reading this book."
5,An Enchanting Look at Savannah,"I read this book several years ago when I was planning a trip to Savannah with my two young children. The story of Savannah is perhaps the most interesting story of any city in the world. Like double chocolate is to a menu, Savannah's rich history is a favorable spice to an enchanting city. ""Eden on the Marsh"" captures the romance of Savannah with its detailed writings, drawings and photographs."
3,An overlooked but mediocre EP,"After getting the Piece Maker, I went out and bought this one to hear more from Tony Touch. This album shows Touch's fans what to expect, and he never changes his style between this and later records. Overall, a pretty ill effort from Tony Touch."
3,Simply a great album.,"This is what I think of as a great album from an underrated band. Maybe not their best, but well worth a listen. Included is the wonderful and moving ""Holding Back The Years"", one of their best songs ever, and probably most popular. ""Money's Too Tight (to mention)"" is another well known song, and rather upbeat. I also really enjoy the cover of ""Heaven"", as it's one of my favorite Talking Heads songs. The rest holds up well, and is still a good listen after all this time. If you're looking for more than the ""Greatest Hits"", give it a try."
2,Bigger than it appears,"The watch is bigger than it appears in the picture, to the point it is almost the size of a mens watch. The packaging was very nice and it is a nice looking watch, but the size is just way too big."
3,"not great, but pretty good","Since I don't sail, I enjoyed all of the descriptions of sailing throughout the book; it gave me a glimpse into a world that I'm not familiar with. Also, the story was definitely not boring; it's a pretty good page-turner.Having said that, the story line is a little weak and contrived, and the central character is such a pathetic, spineless jellyfish that he got a little irritating. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I'm a big fan of older men going out with younger women, and anybody who doesn't like it can take a long walk on a short dock. That should have been the attitude of Tim Blackburn, but instead he was weak, gutless and annoying throughout the entire book.If you can get past that, though, it's a good read."
4,Takes you offshore,"In Cornwell's sailing novels, you are whisked away to the sea. You feel the deck cant under you as the breeze freshens. The salt spray stings your face. And the screeches of sea birds mingle with the creaking of the rigging.That's just a bonus because the characters are finely drawn, the plot moves right along and the writing is economical. This is a good story, told well.I have just one nit to pick with the author. Do your protagonists really have to live the worst possible lives? Is there no loss, injury or disaster that can pass them by? Surely, there can be one book where everything the main character loves and holds dear isn't ripped from his hands and bosom."
2,"Great music, amateurish recording","I fell in love with the Swan Silvertones when I heard their cut on the soundtrack of ""The Big Easy"" (""Saviour, Pass Me Not""). The harmonies, the singing, the tone of the voices were to die for. I looked forward to receiving this CD with great anticipation, but was sorely disappointed when I heard the sound quality. Most tracks (except for 10 and 11) sound like they were recorded by some guy who wandered in off the street with his portable tape recorder. The sound is so bad the magic of the group is totally missing on these cuts. Luckily, track 10 (""I've Got Myself Together"") is almost worth the price of admission - it really cooks. There is no warning about the sound quality in the Amazon listing or on the CD cover. I'd like to buy other CDs by this group, but I'm afraid of getting cheated by unacceptable sound quality.- Hunt"
4,"Great CD, you need to buy it if you love rock!",I really love this CD. I loved it so much that I went out and bought MTV's Return of Rock 2 CD. I think anyone who loves rock should own this CD. It's definitely worth the money to have all of these great artists compiled into one CD. For God's sake go out and buy this CD!!!
1,New (Fake Metal) Trash,"American Spawned fake metal trash. You want real metal, real music, check out the European Scene. In Flames, Children of Bodom, Iced Earth, Dark Tranquility, The Haunted the list goes on and on..."
4,the greatest,the record deffinently should receive 4 stars! the only reason it doesn't get 5 is because with the big bands like slipknot it doesn't play their better songs. but other than that this cd deffinently rocks the house!
4,"Cryptic and compelling ""poems""","When I first saw many of the works that make up Schwerner's TABLETS sequence in Conjunctions magazine back in the 80s, I was hooked: the compelling and playful invention of mythic stories, invented-archeological mock-transcriptions, and odd iconography seemed quite fascinating, and still does. I was saddened to hear the news last year that Schwerner had died, especially since I had been waiting years for someone to finally collect all of these odd and intriguing sections into a single volume."
5,Good resource,"From my amateur viewpoint, one of the best resources on the Mayan culture and history. It contains lots of photos and illustrations (mostly quite old and in black-and-white)and provides a good overview and introduction to the topic. Continuously updated, I saw mostly the 6th and 7th editions for sale in Gautemala, and was glad to find that the 8th edition was released in 2011."
4,Good introduction,"This was a pretty good introduction to the Maya. It has a lot of good reference materials in it, such as time lines and maps. In some areas the writing is a little dry and dull, but overall I felt like I had gotten a fairly good overview of the Maya when I was done. He presents both popular and marginal theories on the various mysteries of the Maya. He is thourough in covering the various aspects of the Maya and I felt it was a good place to start if you are interested in learning more about this culture."
4,Jam packed with information,"There is a lot of information within the book and plenty of images. I personally feel that it could with colour images, however, there are many black and white photographs and illustrations for each chapter. I would recommend this text for all Mesoamerican students and enthusiasts alike."
5,"Nice quality, good price, good book, good buy!","I bought this book for my ancient Maya Art History course. The price was better than I could find anywhere else, so I bought it. It was brand new, and came quite quickly. It is written well, with good flow, and very interesting information. There are great pictures to go along with the facts as well. Good buy all around!"
3,Ok i guess,"Its not a bad book for someone whos just starting to read about them. Good pictures and drawings, not a great book but good enough."
1,Annoyed.,"I bought this as a text book for one of my classes this semester. This is the specific edition that my teacher had told us we needed, so I ordered it. So I'm sure at least some of you can understand my disappointment when I opened the package to find that they had sent me the 6th edition and not the 8th. This happened to me last semester with a french textbook I bought on here as well. If I had wanted the old edition, I would have purchased it. Although the books have only a few differences, that's a few differences too many when you're a college student that doesn't have the time to go searching through the book for things that only the newer edition has."
3,scholarly but difficult to wade through,"I would recommend this book for people who are planning to visit Mayan sites such as Chichen Itza or Tikal, and would like to get a scholarly, authoritative overview of current scientific knowledge. It is not, however, a page turner. The writing style is dry, and a most of the book consists of lengthy lists and descriptions of buildings and artifacts discovered at every major Mayan site, with little analysis or discussion of what the artifacts actually signify. Those who are short of time or patience would do well to skip ahead to the last three chapters, where the author *at last* provides a discussion of Mayan culture and beliefs. This book is still a good use of time for people who want to get a scientific view of Mayan civilization, instead of the myths that the local tour guides will perpetrate. The hand-drawn maps and illustrations are especially beautifully rendered."
3,Maya archeology,"Over three quarters of this book is spent on describing cities and artifacts in a long list. This is probably what Maya specialists are interested in, but I would think that a book with this title should actually try to write the history of the Maya and not just present the archaeological evidence of it. The book finally changes to a more interesting way of presentation towards the end (long after the chapters which judging by their title should have dealt with the different time-periods in Maya history), but up to that point it's pretty tough going for someone who's interested only in a larger view of Maya history."
5,Great overview of the Maya area,"Overall, I found Coe's book to be informative and full of all the necessary facts. At the same time it kept my attention with the beautiful color pictures and descriptions of sites and artifacts. This book will give the reader an overview and introduction to the Maya area while incorporating the latest findings. This makes a great general reference book as well as a good read. The only suggestion I have is that the final three chapters on religion and every-day life come before the in-depth discussion of sites."
4,Introduction to the Mayan culture,"I found this book to be a very good introduction to the Mayan culture, however, introduction may be an understatement. This book is very indepth, and academic in nature which gives it a high level of credibility."
3,Great information but becomes bogged down at times,"This book has great information but at times becomes bogged down and difficult to understand. The first several chapters were the best. Pictures and maps are excellent. Unless you are a true Maya enthusiast, I would pass on this one. There are easier to read books on the subject for the novice."
1,WAHL Neo Rechargeable Cordless Trimmer,"This is a very nice looking trimmer from an excellent company, but the trimmer lacked the power to get through my light beard. And the amount of actual trimming time between each charge was too limited as well."
1,Should be called peach fuz trimmer,"Sick of going through a $20 trimmer ever year or two, i decided to buy a nice one for myself. I was very wrong, or maybe just mistaken, this trimmer has no business going near your face. I do not have a very thick beard, but it has trouble cutting any amount of facial hair, it pulls when i gets stuck because it lacks the torque required to cut hair.If you just want to trim the peach fuz on the back of your neck, this trimmer is for you, but who needs that"
5,Relaxing at the end of our busy day,This CD is the best of all the lullibies that I've heard. I continue to enjoy it long after my 10 month old angel has fallen asleep. I will save this album for him always.
1,Lullabies for the caffeine depraved,"I found most of the songs too ""hopped up"" to help my two year old daughter relax and unwind. This is treated more like playtime music rather than bedtime. Nothing beats Chet Baker sings, especially ""My Funny Valentine"" for a great lullabye"
5,A More Vivid Tolkien... Though Not As Quick-Paced,"The Dragonbone Chair is without a doubt one of my favorite books of all time. The book begins a series that is as vivid and alive as any could hope for when succeeding Tolkien. There is nothing left to question, nothing left unexplored: there is always something happening in this little world, on all corners. However long it takes to build the characters, it's worth it.Though the majority of complaints lash out at the book's slow pace, I find the pace helps establish the characters that make this story grand. By growing with Simon, seeing with Simon, and experiencing with Simon, he is as real a character as one could create. His foolishness and rashness are calmen human qualities (don't deny it.) And the supporting characters around Simon, that engage him and the reader, combine with an ever-expanding plot to create a quality story!"
5,Superb,"The dragon bone chair was a masterfully crafted book in which the author really lets you understand the characters and the world they live in. It gives a light and dark perspective to both opposing forces, and will enthrall readers through the last page and right into the sequal. Pick this book if you are a fan of the fantasy genre!"
5,williams vs. tolkien,"Tad Williams' Dragonbone Chair sets the stage for a saga which rivals even Tolkien's Ring trilogy. And, it tantalizes us even more. The setting is medeival, and achingly like our own history, with parallels to Viking conquest, the advent of Christianity, and much more, with the addition of a very real elven kingdom, Trolls, dragons, and more.If readers enjoy the tale of a simple child set adrift in the warring of mighty forces, as Tolkien did with his hobbits, then this is the best item on the menu. Dragonbone Chair is the first in an epic series of vast tomes, and is not for those who love light reading. Book One lays a foundation only, and is answered by massive volumes of equally weighty stories, each monumental in its own right. If some producer has, at some time, a billion dollars to throw around, this will be the best cinematic series ever created."
3,A Good Series Beginning,This book is almost 800 pages long. The first 400 introduce a few of the main characters. By the middle of the book you begin to care about some of them.The tale unfolds slowly but by the second half of the book my interest peaked. The settings and circumstances for the main characters become more intriguing.At this point a few solid new characters develop quickly and several sub-plots also grab the readers interest.By the end of the book there is enough hope that a great story is emerging to continue reading the remaining two volumes in the series.My advise: Buy it. Stick with it. You will be rewarded with what appears to be the beginning of a pretty good tale.
5,I loved this series,"Though some might call it formulatic, this is the kind of fantasy I love. Magical swords, sorcerors, mythical creatures, and dragons (my all-time favorite fantasy creation) all wrapped up with a ever-twisting story line and believable characters. I found myself enthralled in the story that didn't let up until the series was finished. And I loved the characters (Simon being my favorite). My only complaint with the series was the jumping from one character story to the next. This reached it's climax in The Stone of Farewell with 11 seperate stories at one time. But even this couldn't put a hamper on great writing and story telling. My advice: read this only if you want your free-time monopolized for the next few weeks with an enjoyable series that has a nice happy ending."
2,"Cliche', thy name be Dragonbone Chair.","Yeah, we have Simon the Mary Sue character fighting a great and terrible evil and having prophetic dreams, there's an evil wizard beguiling the kingdom, and every other cliche' fantasy archtype you can think of.If you want GOOD fantasy, go read Glen Cook's Black Company books or even better, George R.R. Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice series, which is excellent.This book was boring, predictable, and I won't be finishing the series. If I wanted underdog vs. great and terrible evil, I'd go read Lord of the Rings, at least that was one of the first of its kind. This is not, and it's also not worth the time it took to read."
1,zzzzzzzzz...,"200 pages of tedium, 300 pages of travelogue, then it finally gets going. i know several people that love this book, and i can't for the life of me understand why. for such a long book, it has amazingly little plot, tension, character development, or drama."
1,a tedious read,"I put this book on my christmas wish list last year, and lo and behold I got three copies! Now I wish I had not wasted my relative's money. I was unable to get past the third chapter. The beginning is boring to say the least, and his writing style practically drew tears of pain from my eyes."
4,Great series but Kindle edition needs some love,"This applies specifically to the Kindle edition. I have the same book in a very worn paperback, so I bought the Kindle edition. I have to say, I am a bit disappointed with the number of typos and spacing problems. This is by no means an isolated issue, I have seen it with other Kindle edition books, but it is very pronounced with this particular book. It is like they just poured the text into a converter and didn't proof it at all. Sad."
1,Regurgitated Lord of the Rings,"I truly enjoy a good fantasy epic story. I was very excited to get lost in this one. However, in addition to it being painfully slow, it was such an unabashed takeoff of LOTR I couldn't take it. I decided time and again to just keep at it and Williams would add his own originality and surprise. I read 590 pages....and then when the good king sent an unlikely small group out on a dangerous quest to find a sword of power in a mountain, that was it. Come on! It was like watching the bad B movie remake of LOTR. Painful."
2,couldn't do it,"I really really tried, but just couldn't do it. I got 100+ pages into the book and was about to give up, but all the reviews on here said stick with it. Now I'm 100 pages from the end, and I don't see any point in going on. While I love Williams' other books, this one jsut did nothing for me. it wandered around too much. I didn't care about the characters. Spend all my time wondering there things were going, and suffered through the plodding to get there. if you've never read Tad before, start somewhere else and find much better material."
4,A book that'll keep you coming for more,"It's an overall good book, but has many of the classical plots used by many authors around the world (i.e. peasant transformed into hero). It wouldn't be good for someone who couldn't stand politics and only reads fantasy cause they're really bloodthirsty, but it's very interesting with fascinating plot twists and strange new ideas never before thought up. It tends to have less action than your usual fantasy book, and it might be more sophisticated than the turtle and the hare, but it's basically a good book that you'll want to read as much as possible. The length might also be a little daunting, but hey, you can handle it. Anyways, you'll wish it was longer by the end of the book. Overall, I'd say it's almost up there, in my opinion, with the Wheel of Time series (Of course, nothing can match that). I'd recommend it for any fantasy-obsessed reader like me."
3,"Good story, good writing, way slow pace.",This book is well written and has a great story. The only problem I saw was that the story kinda crawls along for the first 500 pages.While I didn't love the book I will readily admit that Tad Williams is bright and has alot of potential.
4,Great to relive the tale... only one real problem,"I read Tad's books in hardback when they first came out and I must say that they draw me in the same way they did back then. There are some difficult parts (Tiamak in particular) but I love the way Tad dipicts the Sithi and other nations of men.My only problem is with DAW... THEY DIDN""T FIX ANY OF THE TYPOS AND GRAMMAR PROBLEMS THAT HAVE EXISTED SINCE DAY ONE! What's the use of having Tad write a new forward and not correct these errors? Some people would go as far as accuse DAW of the old ""bait and switch"" ploy. Tad's forward gets old readers excited that there might actually be a bit of new text here and there, alas it's not to be.A great book for people who love fantasy and are looking for a new epic tale to read."
5,Great book!!,"One of the better fantasy epics out there. Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn far surpasses Jordan's Wheel of Time series. The characters have depth and are very unique and the plot is superb. I would have to say that Mr. Williams is almost as good as Stephen R. Donaldson. Talent like his is rare and greatly needed in the fantasy genre. I just hope he writes more fantasy epics in the near future."
3,Not bad but tend to get slow and annoying,"It could be an interesting trilogy but for few things. Tad Williams tends to lose threads of the story and then tries to tie them together without much success. Characters are clueless and do not have sufficient depth seeming to spend most of their time in self-whipping. Many dialogs span pages with nothing except ""I'll tell you the story but later/after you eat/after you sleep/when I feel like it"" To show the differences between races Tad Williams distorts their speech and that gets more than annoying especially in Binabik's case."
3,This book isn't for ALL fantasy fans.,"I often consult amazon and the fantasy finder page before deciding what to read next, and of all the advice I took from these pages and its readers, this trillogy didn't work out for me at all. Undeniably a well developed world, but the characters made me want to cry. So dull! To a person who likes high action, this series seemed to drag on for ever. With all the praise this book had recieved I felt obligated to follow through and finish the whole thing- It had to really take off sooner or later... nope! There's no denying that this series has a strong following, but if it's action in a fantasy novel that turns you on- pass this one by. PS: Don't vote this review as ""unhelpful"" if you simply disagree with it... There are many who agree with me that it's not for everyone."
2,Helps you fall asleep,"In this case I'm afraid I must agree with many of the more negative reviews. This book is simply INCREDIBLY slow and boring. It drags on and on and on, about a dull life in a castle, then a trip that is equally boring, on and on and on... The main character is extremely hard to like; slow, dull witted and whimsical. He mopes about, drags his feet, cries and feels sorry for himself. What is his reason for existing? I can't stand him. Most of the figures feels very paper cut, not even Dr Morgenes - whom I would like to feel something for - manages to capture me at any deeper level.I'm at over 400 pages and still struggling. I only kept at it because it helps me fall asleep at night. Put your money on something else."
3,An intriguing drama full of surprises.,"Dragonbone Chair: The land of Osten Ard feels the loss of its High King, Prester John. But the heir to the throne, Elias, is not what his father was. Evil slowly gains strength in the land. This book was very intriguing, although somewhat boring at times. For example, the first two-hundred pages are somewhat boring, yet read those pages carefully, because you will need to know the information it contains. After that, the book gets very exciting, although confusing at times. This book really jumps the series off well, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy an political dramas."
4,"Gripping. Very, very gripping.","When I started reading the quatrology starting with the Dragonbone Chair, I first was shocked by the similarity of the religion in the story compared to Christianism. Also, I did not like the names of most of the persons. But over the months and the other books I grew to like the characters that much that I couldn't stop reading and one day, I yelled out loud ""no!"" on the subway.... (to be exact, at the part where Miriamel meets Aspitis) ...how embarrassing!To all new readers I want to say this: Keep on reading (though it may be a bit boring in the beginning), it is worth it!"
3,"Good book, but...","I've read all the great reviews this series got, and I have to think that maybe I missed something. I thought the plot was great. Tad also does a great job with scene developement, better than Tolkien in my opion. When reading the story, it's easy to imagine the world and the activities going on. The story takes off a bit slow, but the environment keeps you interested. The main character starts off very immature, which is understood, but it takes far too long for him to grow up. He crys at every opportunity for the first book and most of the second. I remind you that the story is great. You follow the main character through the whole story and watch him grow. Really great!Now for my recommendations. Tad's other stories are good too, but you'll need an open mind. I give Tolkien only a 4.5 rating for Lord of the Rings, and I give G. Martin a 5 star for the first bood Game of Thrones."
2,third times a charm,"After reading the reviews of this book, I think that I am finally going to complete it. I have read the first quarter of it twice and couldn't get interested, but someone said that it doesnt't get going until about one third way through, so here I go.. Thanks for the input."
4,A great book with a boring introduction,"The Dragonbone Chair was a great start on the amazing series, Memory, Sorrow and Thorn, but it was most certainly not the best of the series. It's introduction seemed to take the first third of the book, and was not very interesting, and because of that, it took me a very long time to get into it. But by the time I got through ""Simon Mooncalf"", the first third of the book, I was hooked, and I knew there would be no going back."
4,Decent but not stand out,"I believe that this book is a good read and I would recommend it because it is enjoyable. there is nothing, however, that really sets it apart as being fresh or spectacular. The series is a little unevenly paced, seeming to move quickly at some times, and painfully slow at others, but all around a good time. I have bought this book as a gift before and I would do it again for any avid fantasy reader"
3,Begins a great story arc,"This book starts my favorite series of any genre. However, this book should not be attempted by a weekend reader. While the series is good, the first book moves slowly, and I feel that unless you read books quick you will get disenhartened and bored before long - but if you do make it to the end, one of the best endings of all books awaits. Its other strengths are a believable fantasy world - a human world, with almost no magic, monsters or other races, meaning that the world is understandable and easier to emerse oneself in - like Eddings, without gods. Note that the word is almost - minute amounts of magic, monsters and elf-equivalents appear in mostly supporting roles."
5,A short and simple review:,"All I will say (because the folks before me have left good reviews) is that this is the first book of my favorite fantasy series of all time. Sure, the beginning is a bit slow, but it only gets better from there on.Since reading this, I have read all of Tad's work, save Shadowmarch, which I am ordering as we speak."
1,Not good.,"I kept waiting for this series to get interesting. It never really did. It almost did, but not quite. The twist at the end of the final book was good, but all in all, thinking about the series makes me yawn."
2,Slow,"This book was really slow, but if you can get through it, then it is deffinitely worth it. Hope the next two go faster though."
3,Not a good start.,"A friend highly reccomended this book, so I will ammend this review when I finish. I have to comment on this Author's Warning in the opening of the book. The author tries very hard to sound deep and foreboding. He repeats himself and is redundant. This is within a half-page of text. Hopefully he was trying to be cute, as it is not part of the main text."
2,"Not bad, just not good.","There's nothing in particular that was bad about this book. Usually when I can't finish a book it's because there are some really annoying characters or the author has a really bad style of writing. That wasn't the case here; I just couldn't get into it. The plot was a little too slow and I didn't care enough about the characters to make it through the story with them. I got about halfway through the book and it became too much of a struggle to finish each chapter. So it's not a bad book, it just wasn't good enough to finish. Ever since I started reading George R.R. Martin so many authors seem to have the skill of children."
4,"Good story, I look forward to the rest of the series","I've just finished book one of this series and am waiting for the second to arrive.It took me a bit longer than usual to get into Williams' world, but I think he does a virtuoso job of world building-- very, very descriptive. I like his main character and find that he acts convincingly. As is often the case, his protagonist isn't as interesting as many of the supporting characters. I like the idea of friendly trolls and think the Sithi will turn out to be very interesting characters.While agree that parts of the story line are the same as many other fantasy novels (ignorant boy thrown into quest-type situation) I think Williams is doing a great job with it.I don't think this would be a good book if a person is looking for a stand-alone novel, so you'd better be prepared to do some reading if you buy the first book."
4,An excellent Fantasy novel,"An excellent beginning to the 3 part series. Tad Williams is an expert story teller, and the characters grow throught the entire three books, including this first. Much deeper than the traditional quest fantasy, as Mr. Williams delves into the ""why"" of the characters throughout the series.Take a look at the other novels in the series, noting how many high reviews they have received, and realize that this book is rated abnormally low on amazon due to only 3 people leaving a review."
5,A treachorous tale of evil sorcery and mankind,"I've read this book twice and everytime i've read it gets better and better.The Dragone Chair by Tad Williams is a strange and wonderfully detailed book about Simon, an apprentice to the wizard Morgenes and a kitchen boy, discovers the truth to the secret of Orten Ard when Morgenes dies after the king's soldier's attacked his room and Simon manages to escape ;Simon then discovers the terrible secret of the underworld. Through soceries and dank evil battling the good of mankind,this book brings adventure books to a new level"
4,The rest of the series is worth it.,"I am writing this review after having read the entire series,and although Im giving it 4 stars, this book was probably more like a 3. Getting through the first 400 pages of this book is difficult at best, and the immaturity of the main charachter Simon is enough to make you want to put it down. But if you can make it through the first half of the book, it starts to gain momentum and by the end you will want to continue the series. This is an excellent series in whole and one of the best I have read to be honest. After this first book its difficult to put down. So knowing that a bad rating would turn some away from the series, I am giving it 4 stars just because to miss this entire series due to 400 mind numbing pages would be a shame."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","This book isn't really bad, but I would not call it a masterpiece. The first problem is that it is really long. I dont mind a long well written book, but this is not well written. There are moments that the author takes pages when he should have used sentences. This really sets up bad pacing. Just when you start to get into it, he ends up rambling and destroying any momentum he had. The other problem is that the plot is your standard peasant boy who is more than he seems to be goes on a quest to save the world. But despite these shortcomings I am interested to see what happens next, and I guess you cannot ask for more than that. Overall I would say that this is a better series to start than the wheel of time (you will actually be able to finish this series!). Give it a try, you might like it."
3,Ssssllllllooooooowwwwwwww............,I decided to read this book after hearing (and reading) positive reviews of it. I find that I have little to say. Williams develops an interesting world and interesting characters. The only drawback is the amout of time he takes to do so. I'm three quarters of the way through the book and it's just now starting to pick up! It has taken a tremendous amount of willpower to stay with it up till now. I'm afraid that I'll fall asleep if I read it too late at night. It is only in retrospect that I am able to say anything positive about the novel. Due to the time the author has taken in developing the characters I do feel like I know them. The plot is solid and even interesting. IF ONLY HE WOULD GET ON WITH IT! If you want to read this book make certain you have a pot of coffee handy.
1,"Cliched, no originality, boring.","Yet another epic where a country boy has to go on a quest to stop an ancient wizard who was defeated hundreds of years ago but now is amassing an army. Instead of rings, they're trying to find swords. One of the main characters is a suspiciously hobbit-like troll. Williams should be embarrassed--what's the point of writing a book if all you're going to do is rewrite Tolkein, and do it badly at that?"
1,Blacklisted - Georestricted - Not Free SF Reader,"A standard fantasy, but non-standard, if you see what I mean. You havea young boy setting out to become more than he his. However, this storyis not of the princess, knight and dragon school of high fantasy, andhas always seemed to more, more realistic, perhaps a little grittier,or more grounded, which made it enjoyable enough to get through."
3,Good and bad,"This book is entertaining, but I was disappointed at the fact that Willams basically ripped off tried and true races such as elves and orges and just renamed them as if he had created them. Bad move! You didn't invent them so please don't write them as if they were your own. Aside from that this series is very entertaining, although the love relationship between simon and the princess has to be the most painful, excrutiating, awkward and embarassing segment I have ever read in a book."
4,The Dragonbone Chair,"This is a wonderfully well written book, I look forward to the next in the series!"
4,the journey not the destination,"Tad Williams is a fantastic author.Skillfully crafted, this entire series has left a mark on my own style. I was thoroughly entertained by this 4 book trilogy.Be warned, these thick tomes are spellbound with compulsive-page-turn +4I have to admit the plot culmination is somewhat Robert Jordanish in its swift vagueness.It is the journey and not the destination that makes this series shine."
2,Let's just call it an old story...,"I'm not sure if one can compare a fantasy epic to another, but Tad Williams just makes me think of what Tolkien would have done, had he been an American of the late 20th century. And I don't mean this as a positive comment. Technically he is a capable writer, but everything in this saga speaks of utter lack of ideas. A moralistic, black-and-white tale with no inspiration, it seems. Characters are thin as paper."
5,Wowee !!!,"I had already been introduced to Williams with Tailchaser's Song when I picked up this book.I had enjoyed my previous interaction with his work,but was slightly disappointed.I had expected it to be a lot better than it actually was.But then I picked up this book I expected it to just a moderately pleasurable read Tailchaser's song.But what a surprise!The main character had much more of a thourough personality,and it was also much more complete as far as culture goes.Many more languages,trolls,giants,dragons,everything a fantasy lover should want is here!The quest is not something where you immediately what know the purpose of it is.You just gradually learn more of what's going on as the story proceeds.Anyone who appreciates,Jordan or Feist should like this if they are in there right mind.P.S.The adventure doesn't begin for the first one or two hundred pages,so don't be appalled."
5,In love<3,I have a passion for books... so let me warn you now the first 150 pages will definitely test your resolve.. I was so angsty to get to the good parts that I didn't absorb as many of the names and places as I should have.. what to me started out as an extremely dull read started blossoming almost instantaneously into a page turning addiction till the end of this novel! I could only have a deep appreciation for the intricate groundwork Williams creates in the Castle Hayholt..The story line is superbly put together (minus some grammatical errors that I could care less about compared to the quality of the story and the richness of young Seoman's world)and flows wonderfully!If there are any avid readers out there who are sad that a good book ends after 300 pages...You are in for thousands with this great series.. I cannot wait to get my hands on his other works am so happy I took a friends advice!Great job Williams
1,"A languorous, long-winded bore","I loved Tad Williams ""Otherland,"" so I bought the pricier, trade paperback versions of all three books in this series. Initially, his beautiful writing kept me reading through long, uneventful passages...until I realized that the entire book is a gigantic UNevent! Cardboard characters, lame plot, horrible pacing...basically 638 pages of painful back-story. An awful waste of time and money."
5,Astoundingly delicious,Genius in writing. The characters are like members of your own family. Robert Jordan style in an earlier work. My only regret is that the series is only 3 books. Not to be missed by any so-called readers of fantasy. My favorite trilogy
3,The Dragonbone Chair was quite a good book.,"Tad Williams' The Dragonbone Chair was a good, original story with great characters. The Hero, Simon, was a none too bright kitchen boy who managed to get himself mixed up in things beyond his understanding. The book was written well, and although the characters are very well described, Tad Williams went into too much detail about everything else - he described everything he saw in great detail, telling the history of the object as well as the impact it had on the story. It didn't matter whether the object was a dead leaf or a great stone castle, you would know everything about it within a few minutes.Other than the amount of detail in the book, it was a good, entertaining story which made me want to read the rest of the series."
4,"When it finally started cooking, it really cooked!!","I really loved this book... once it got going, and believe me it did take a while. The first eighty or so pages seemed like a bog to have to slog through, but bam! Once things started happening they really got exciting. I would recommend this book to readers of all kinds, especially if you are into Terry Brooks, the ""Death Gate"" books, or Tolkien. I can't believe I have to wait all week to get the next one!"
3,No answers to math problems!!!,"The book is ok when it comes to the case studies, but when you have to complete the math problems there are no answers to reference. Just hope that your answers are correct!"
4,The text is average and the cases are exceptional.,"The competitive advantage that this marketing textbook has is the detailed cases. There are over twenty to use and they are all very well done. Broadly written, but with enough empirical data to allow for thorough analysis.I recommend this text."
4,good book,This book is good for the Marketing Management class I am taking to get my MBA. I do a lot of case work and the book is full of cases. I enjoy the case layouts and there is enough information to accurately diagnose a problem and create thorough alternatives.
4,Chapter two is most valuable!,"Chapter two has a really good, in depth, review of basic marketing math."
1,ummmm....,"What??? $75 (reduced price) for a paperback book? I don't care if it's written by Jesus H. C., that is too damn expensive."
5,all the wonderful songs,"this CD has all the wonderful George Brassens tunes. Although I have to say, I like Carla Bruni's edition of ""Fernandes"" better."
4,About the Berenstian Bears,The Berenstain bears was a fun and good book to read for me. After I read this book it made me think of when my family and I go on vacation. This book might take a child quit a while to read because there where a lot of words on each page but they would like this book. The book was mainly about Papa bear having a good time and the rest of the family not really enjoying not having electricity and relying on the woods for food and supplies. When they finally arieve the place is a mess and the lake was crappy. The first night of sleep did not work out too well with all of the animals making noise. The next day Papa bear had now luck catching fish and there was a big rain storm which gave the family pleanty of reason to go home. The Bears where never so happy to see their tree house. This was a good book nothing special about it just a fimly out on vacation with not much to do.
4,good book,"The book is great. Except for Trapped. Haunted and Bad Moonlight were great. Melissa is haunted by a future ghost, danielle is scared because someone is killing her friends."
5,Strong,"This is the type of Vietnam book that I have been searching for. No nonsense, to the point, and not afraid to offend. Funny, sad and anger provoking all at once. Quick moving and an easy read. I have let friends borrow this book and they have all enjoyed it."
5,A True Vietnam War Hero!,"""The Proud Bastards"" is one of the best books I've ever read. Michael Helms tells his true and pain story of MARINE boot camp and the Hell of Vietnam. The book is intense and extremely realisitic(because it's true). This is a story of a young man's right of passage to man hood through the horrors of war. A true classic and a must buy for everyone interested in the Vietnam War. ""Welcome Home, A Salute to the forgotten Vietnam War Heroes"" is another book E. Michael Helms will be appearing in. It will be out in December. Please e-mail me at AeroPosse3@aol.com for more information. Semper Fi, Mike!"
5,It's a mix of the best music on Earth,"This album has many kinds of styles embedded. For example in ""La fille de l'aeroport"" we can see influences from reggae, we also have rock and pop. It's just wonderful, you can't miss it."
5,REALLY WORTH THE MONEY!,"This manual may not be big in number of pages , but the information is priceless .I don't care if it was wrote on 50 pages of Toilet paper ! Mr. Cooper gave me 2 very important things I was missing in my Trading and I've been even more profitable for it .I HIGHLY RATE this manual."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!,"This book has almost nothing to offer! By his own admission (from Cooper's interview above)"" ..I am wrong at least 40 percent of the time, if not higher. "".How much higher? 45%? 55%? This is insane! The man is admitting that he loses money on nearly half his trades! And you wanna buy a 61-page book ... from him? Think about it!"
4,Interesting cases and informative learning!,"I rarely ever rate textbooks, but I find this one particularly interesting and helpful to my work and education (Master's program)."
3,Good large wipe,These are large full body wipes. I use them while camping and hunting. I use them for an alternative to a shower when no water is available. They also sometimes leave lint other wise I think they are great.
5,Lifted Up by Victoria A. Tolbert,"This book is excellent for Liberian history, especially the Coup of 1980. It clears up a lot of misinformation circulated out there about what happened in the Mansion that night. I would recommend this book to every student of African History, and Liberians in general."
1,Very harmful for my body....,I've taken diet pill before but this green tea fat burner was a nightmare...It gave me a lot of energy for my exercizes but it I started waking up 3 times during my sleep every night that I took this pill. I stopped taking it and I stopped waking up in the middle of the night. This fat burner also caused mood swings....major mood swings...
2,Two Stars for Sean,"I have to agree with Mr. Hurst's eloquent review, and I'll put it more succinctly: this is a lousy book. Why write a biography of Errol Flynn, of all people, if you're going to do it with no humor and with lordly disdain? It's like a biography of Tom Sawyer written by his half-brother, the tattle-tale goody-goody Sid. Like many, I guess, I picked it up in order to read about Sean Flynn, since there is so little out there about him. But as noted, Sean is reduced to three chapters presented as endpapers. One might conclude there wasn't enough to his short life to make a full book... if there weren't so much other evidence of the biographer's tendency to stop researching once he has enough evidence to support his (rather ugly) pre-determined thesis."
5,No problems,"I received the product when expected, packaging was perfect and there were no problems. I already have this pattern and when I married I needed to expand my quantity and could not find the pattern in stores anymore. The price was better than I paid when I originally purchased this pattern in stores 8 years ago."
4,Very cheery dishes!,"I love these dishes! They're pretty inexpensive, but durable and really cute. The little birds and birdhouses are so charming, I've had them for over a year now and they still make me smile. I like that they take up very little space in the cabinet (we live in a tiny apartment), are super light weight, and the one time I dropped a glass on the floor, it didn't break!The only down sides are that the pattern isn't always printed perfectly around the edges (I decided to exchange a set because of this) and the plates are showing little lines where forks and knives clanked against them. I also wish they sold more serving pieces with the Garden Home design.Regardless, I'm pleased with these dishes and am soon going to be ordering a third set so I'll have 12 place settings. I expect these dishes to last a long time!"
4,Trying to just live it.,"omg! I pulled this out of the shelves to read because we had a storm and tv with the internet is off. And I never thought it is this much of a page turner.It's about a life of Matthew Bourne, a human right activist who is trying to save the life of Jarawa. In the midst of trying to do this, his own life is falling apart. He has live-in artist partner with a daughter, and on the side a mistress of his own. He found out his partner is sleeping with somebody else.it was kind of annoying at firts because it took me a few chapters to realized what's exactly is going on. but it's a good past time reading. some plot really do pull you into the book itself."
5,Fantastic,These strings are just fantastic. The coating makes it so easy to play and no string squeak!
2,not as listed,"The item listed is a three piece sugar bowl and creamer, which is supposed to include a covered sugar bowl and a 12 ounce cream pitcher. Beware, what you will receive is a sugar bowl only. I never could get Customer Service to understand my plight. I hope the product is labeled properly now. It's a beautiful sugar bowl, but it is only half of what the seller promised for that price"
4,Kids Love This Horse,"I bought this rocking horse for my grandson's first birthday. He liked it from the start, but it took a few weeks for him to love it. He likes the sound and mom and dad felt that he was safe while riding. Mom was able to take the safety seat off when he was 18 months old. Next, my granddaughter turned 1 year old and, yes, we got one for her,too. She loves it as much as my grandson did. Do get the rocking horse with the sound - I can't imagine it without it. And, we got a great price from Amazon and it was delivered right on schedule.Thanks,Grandma"
4,Great Fun for my 10 month old,"I bought this horse for my 10 month old son. He wasn't sure about it at first, but he caught on to it quick. He likes the sound, so I am glad I bought the horse with sound. My husband and I crack up watching him try to figure out how to ride the horse, while making sure to bite the crackle sounding ears as he goes. I think that he will enjoy it much more as he gets older. When he is able to pull up and climb on to it himself, I think he will really love it!!"
4,Horse Crazy,"I bought this horse for my Granddaughter for her 1st birthday. At first she was afraid of it. By 14 mos. she likes to sit in it. I think maybe I should have been more careful about the age approriateness. Or maybe she is just a little cautious. In any case, she loves it now and I'm glad I purchased it."
3,Not worth all the extra money for the ponty to talk!,"The product overall is good. I just think our son 12months old is a little to young for the pnoy. And the music and sounds it makes, makes him cry. And it also makes the 17month old little next door nieghbor cry too. But i think he will like it a lot more once he gets older."
4,Radio Flyer Classic Rock and Bounce Pony with Sound,"Who would have known after 14 months this horse that we named ""Lucky"" would still be such a hit. Orginally purchased for our sons 1st christmas... its still a huge hit.. orginal batteries are still going strong... At the time we were hesitant at price... and now we know it was well worth it!!!!"
3,Both good and bad about Alfred Lee Loomis,The book describes the scientific accomplished and the sometimes selfish persona of Alfred Lee Loomis. Often the biographies of famed people are entirely one-dimensional: admiring and eclipsing the negatives. The book has both dimensions.
2,A very poorly written story,"After reading a very positive review of this book, I was surprised at how pooly written and edited it is. The story telling is choppy, at best. The author has somehow managed to take a very interesting time in world history and some very interesting people and turn them into a very boring story.To make matters worse, technical terms and jargon are used with little or no explanation. I get the distinct feeling that the author herself doesn't fully understand what they mean. She certainly gives no indication that she is familiar with radar technology or nuclear physics.There is probably an interesting story to be told here. Perhaps this book will inspire someone to tell it in a more compelling, or at least coherent, fashion."
4,history of science,"I liked this book. I like history of science, and also history of economics. In this tale of pre-and post-Depression physics and investment banking, the two areas are strongly entwined in ways I have often suspected. In this biography of Alfred Loomis, the interactions exist within one man and his life."
3,No physics in a book about a physicist!,"My title gives my major complaint about this book. I found a lot of the details about Loomis' early life fascinating, but when he became a physicist and inventor, more about the physics should have been told. I also thought the book hurried to an unsatisfactory ending when World War II ended; the pacing should have remained consistent throughout. I really enjoyed her other book and thought she told a complete story (that book is ""109 East Palace Avenue""), so it's not that Conant is incapable of concluding historical biography, just that she didn't in this case. Too bad, it's the only bio of Loomis out there."
1,My Own Opinion,"A dry and rather tedious read. Poorly written and edited account of a man who wanted to remain in the background and in obscurity and probably should have been left there. This had all the makings of a great story; millionaire scientist, secret war research, cheating husband, suicide and even a diaper truck...but falls flat. The minor story of the authors relative is more interesting but both stories are lost as this is more of a ""who was who"" during WWII wall street. Reads like a prospectus."
2,Uncritical account of Loomis by her relative,"Nowhere in the book does Conant talk about how Loomis used his regulated utility holdings to subsidize the unregulated holdings... and he charged regulated customers for the subsidiaries' huge profits. The Public Utilities Holding Companies Act (PUHCA) of the 1930's was enacted and made illegal the very things that Loomis made his fortune on. Check out the SEC for PUHCA. But there is no mention of this. Conant writes a biased and uncritical account of one of her relatives.Also poorly written. Incoherent writing style that blends scientific writing with prose...makes for muddled and unnatural reading. Also fails to describe sufficiently, important scientific advances discussed in the book, namely the Magnetron or Cyclotron, which I had to go look up."
4,Steven Winkler's review of Jennet Conant's Tuxedo Park,"Length:: 8:02 MinsSteven Winkler's review was made as part of a critical review assignment for the Fall 2008 Economics of Entrepreneurship seminar at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, taught by Art Diamond. (The course syllabus stated that part of the critical review assignment consisted of the making of a video recording of the review, and the posting of the review to Amazon.)"
5,Best of best,"Dragon is back and powerfuly. Fantactic fight scenes make up this movie. Rent or buy it, whatever it costs"
2,a bit too much,"being a big :wumpscut: fan, it is difficult to review this album. though the original version of totmacher is an excellent song, and a great deal of these remixes are very well done .. this is waaay too much. i don't think it is possible to listen to this album in its entirety at once, it gets to be a bit repetetive. some of the remixes are done very well, though, namely those done by daniel meyer of haujobb. this cd is worth a listen, but you probably won't put it on more than a couple times"
3,Wumpscut - Deadmaker,"Wow, this was just overkill. By the end I actually started to hate the song. There are some killer remixes on here, and then of course there are some really bad ones, the rest are just run of the mill and truly add nothing. The ""Shivering Noises"" between each track are short little ambient pieces that are kind of cool but really unnecessary, I think this CD would have been better off as a 5 track single, not a 36 track double disc. Do not listen to in one sitting, it will forever ruin your perception of an otherwise great song."
4,STONESCAPING,"Book as described. Good instructions and nice photography. Overall, it delivers what it promised. Recommend."
5,Decent reference with wide appeal,"David Reed covers the gamut of stonework techniques from selection to design to implementation in this book. His treatment of the subject is straightforward and easy to understand, while at the same time working in the history, emotional appeal and crafter's zeal I associate with stonework. Thankfully absent from this text is the typical extensive coverage of concrete and other 'wet' media: Reed and his contributing authors work mainly with dry-stacked stone, preferring a more natural look. One failing I saw was a concentrated discussion of stone types native only to his area; wider coverage of various types of stone and perhaps a pictoral glossary, would have been appropriate and worth-increasing. In total, nonetheless, a well-written, well-organized motivated treatment of what the author clearly loves."
3,"Decent introduction to stonework, but better books available","This is a decent book for the novice to overcome any initial trepidation about building drystone features. It is well illustrated, and comprehensive enough to get you started. However, with a few exceptions, the stonework illustrated is of average quality. For a true photo reference on the art of drystone, I would recommend Dan Snow's ""In the Company of Stone"" over Reed's book any day. Combine it with John Vivians ""Building Stone Walls"", and you will have everything you need to enter the world of drystone work: quality pictures of excellent stonework for reference, and solid, no nonesense text to guide you."
4,Stonescape,"A good book for anyone interested in landscaping their yard with dry stacked stones. It teaches you much more than just making retaining walls. Learn how to make paths, steps, benches, pools, and how to integrate plants into the stonework. It could have used some more photos of finished projects, but overall it should be enough to help you finish any stonescaping project you take on."
4,Check your facts before writing a review,"One of the previous reviewers has no idea what he is saying. I worked at Gettysburg, and 56,000 people did not die there in three days. First of all, the number of casualties was not that high, it was more like 52,000. Secondly, the term ""casualties"" includes killed, mortally wounded, wounded, and captured. So 52,000 did not die at Gettysburg, but about 10,600 died, if you include both killed and mortally wounded. The remaining 40,000+ casualties were either wounded or captured.Similarly, all the numbers presented in all the other battles are CASUALTIES, which refers to killed, mortally wounded, wounded, and captured. Those numbers do not represent the DEAD.Vietnam had 58,000 DEAD, not total CASUALTIES."
2,Yawn. BORING!,"Speeches are boring. Not much to say there. But what White has done is just plain horrible. 256 pages of horrible actually. Though White's essay/book is informational and effective, it is extensive and overfilled with pointless history.Breaking down Lincoln's speech, White provides powerful information about the rhetorical devices Lincoln uses to unify the nation. However, this `powerful' information is often drowned out by the incessant historical lessons. In reality, this story is more of a biography than an analysis on Lincoln' Second Inaugural address. Although this may excite some people, for most, myself included, this is more of a turn off.So if you want to read some history, go ahead, pick up this book. But if your looking for information on Lincoln's Second Inaugural, I strongly suggest that you go on the internet to get your information."
2,Not Worth the Time or Effort,"Found this book to be onerously biased and self serving. Ronald Whites depiction of Lincoln lacks any credibility, considering the fact that Lincoln the man was such a complicated human being, politician, and president. Not worth the time or effort!"
4,A look inside Lincoln's thinking.,"I never thought a book about a speech would be so very interesting. White does a great job dissecting this short speech and Lincoln's thinking behind it. At the time, the speech was not thought of well, but after his assassination, the words became the last testament of this great president. With malice toward none and charity to all, these words came to embody Abraham Lincoln.I was especially interested in the spiritual aspects in both the speech and Lincoln. White makes Lincoln come across as a spiritual person, who believed in fate. The book examines his experience in three Protesant denominations. As we look at Lincoln's spiritual growth, we find this reflected in his speeches, especially his Second Inaugural. The last speech contained many references to God.This is a great book about Lincoln. For those who want to understand Lincoln more, White's book examines a crucial episode in the final stages of this president's life."
5,Absolutely Great!,"I was a student studying french and picked up this album without knowinganything about Julien Clerc. The soft-rock music is very good. The french is clear and crisp and very understandable. The tunes are unforgetable, perfect. I particularly like My Preference, Elle Voulait Qu'on L'appelle Venise, Coeur de Rocker, et La Fille aux bas Nylon. Really, all the songs are my favorite from this album."
4,Helpful in study,"Dr. Macarthur is truly an awesome man of God, you can definately feel the power of the holy spirit as he explains and illustrates through this commentary"
1,The worst invesment of motherhood,"I wish I would have tried this stroller out before buying it. It is cumbersome, awkward, huge, hard to maneuver and I wish I had never bought the darn thing. I have used it less then a dozen times and the clip broke and the stroller in unable to be used. The company has a non working customer service number and at this point I am awaiting my refund from Amazon. DON'T DO IT!!!"
3,No Shade,"I love the stroller in that it has a smooth ride and looks cool. However, if you live in a sunny state, the canopy is TOO SMALL and not very functional at all. It is not big enough, and I spend half my time adjusting the small canopy to keep the sun out of my 4 mo olds face. (If you live in a foggy place...this canopy could work as it has a rain guard) I didn't think the small underbasket would be a big deal..but I really miss the storage space. If I'm going to pay $500 for a stroller and lug a big heavy one around, I should at least have sun protection for my baby and a basket to hold things."
1,Beware !!!,"Before buying the stroller,I read a lot of reviews on this stroller and they were all good. So I decided to buy it, what a BIG mistake!!! Everything is wrong with this stroller: my son is 3 months and the basinet is small for him. I can't go to the supermarket because I can't fit my bags under the basinet. You could only fit something VERY small there,so don't rely on it. Then, the front wheels are horrible.I'm trying to go straight they going sideways. Honestly, I wish I could return this stroller. My advice,before you buy ANY strollers go to the store and try it out.I didn't do that and I learned my lesson."
2,"Not worth the money,",The clip broke on my stoller so now it will not collapse. I had it for only 1 month until problems occured. I emailed the company but did not receive a response.
2,not worth the $$,"We've gotten some good use out of this stroller - the frame works with the Graco snugride, and that has been an excellent feature. Also the stroller is quite easy to assemble and collapse. However, now that my baby is starting to outgrow his carseat, and I have to use the stroller seat itself, I am very dissapointed with it. The seat is big, bulky and cumbersome, and we cannot fit it into the trunk of our car (Honda Civic). We also got very little use out of the basinette (he outgrew it by 10 weeks), and the sunshade/canopy might as well not be there it's so small. The basket is equally as useless, and can barely carry anything - this is VERY frustrating. I wish we had bought the Valco Lattitude stroller. It has all the same features (except the wheels) with a much bigger basket and canopy, is lightweight, compact, and about half the price of the RSB."
5,Much Ado About Nothing,"My favorite feel good movie. Beautiful scenery and costumes, a fabulous cast,and funny! A Shakespeare play everyone can enjoy. One of the few videos I own. I replaced my video cassette with a new CD; now I can watch it whenever I need a break from everyday life."
3,"Great Shakespeare, but not a great movie.","Having read the reviews here, I figured the DVD version of 'Much Ado about Nothing' would be a great purchase. But, it's really just a glorified Shakespearean play. Now, I'm not saying that I don't like Shakespeare--I'm simply saying that it doesn't adapt well as a full length movie.Granted, the actors and actresses do play their parts well. But if you can get past the Shakespearean language, you'll still find a very simple plot with a few holes left out. I'd think it would be much better if they had added a few more detailed transistions to help the story along. But since they are following a script for a stage play, the transistions are very abrupt, and not always fully explained.If you like Shakespeare, I'm sure you'd enjoy this adaptation, but if just want to see a GOOD movie, this is not the one to watch."
5,"Sigh no more ladies, sigh no more.","I give this movie 10 STARS! The casing was perfect! The story was perfect! I could marry shakespear for creating such a perfect work of art!(well maybe not, but....) Benedict was so adorable, and beatrice was such a softie at heart, and yet, claudio was annoying in a cute sort of way, hero was so sweet and I've watch this show thousands of times, and will continue to watch in forever more! and be hay bonnie bonnie!"
5,Wonderful adaptation of one of Shakespeare's best comedies,"Branagh excels at adapting Shakespeare in a way that is both relevant and interesting to today's audiences, and he succeeds at doing that very well in this film. The performances given by he and Emma Thompson as Beatrice and Benedick are excellent, as is the rest of the cast--with the exception of Keanu Reeves, who must be placed on ignore. The scenery is beautiful, as well as the costumes. A wonderful movie!"
4,A GOOD DVD RELEASE FOR A FINE FILM!!!,"William Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" is brought to life with elegance and grace. Aside from the nudity and [adult] content, this is a great film full of funny humor, a great cast and brilliant filmmaking (Credit for that goes to Kenneth Branagh, who has proven time and again that he is as fine a director as Spielberg, Lucas, and Scorcese, if not better). The second DVD release features a fine digital transfer of the film, complete in it's 1.85:1 Widescreen format. The short featurette ""Making 'Much Ado'"" is not the best doc ever made, but it does it's job. Other special features include the Theatrical trailer and trailers for the ""When Harry Met Sally..."" and ""The Princess Bride"" DVD's. A fine addition to the collection. Get this along with ""Henry V.""Movie Grade: A+DVD Grade: A-"
4,A great bit of folly,"A very good friend of mine has no time for college. However, as an active duty Marine, he is allowed to take CLEP & Dantes (college credit examinations) for free.I stumbled on the idea that he might be able to attain the knowledge necessary to pass these exminations in literature by watching videos and DVDs. We started with this modern production of a Shakespearean classic. It was a great introduction. Fast-paced and funny, it's a great evening of entertainment and if you can learn something in the process, why not?Be you blithe and bonney! Have a wonderful evening with this wonderful tale."
3,Uneven acting,"Branagh and Thompson are fine actors, but the one glaring, grating blot on the whole is the ridiculous portrayal of Dogberry by Michael Keaton. He was not funny or good-hearted in his little pretensions, but crude, vulgar, and ludicrous. What were they thinking, allowing this portrayal? And other Hollywood figures in the cast did not manage to fit into the language and spirit of Shakespeare."
1,Import DVD,I was aware this was an import. When I received my DVD I was unable to play it because it is not numbered for my area.When I received my DVD the envelope said Belgium. So I do not have a playable video.
1,PRICEY!?,"This movie sounded like something I might really enjoy, until I saw the price. Almost $50 for a one-disc movie? Unbelieveable."
4,I liked it.,"Great film, but Reeves should stick with the Matrix type movies. Was he supposed to be funny?"
5,Absolutely wonderful movie!,This is the play that should be taught in high school along side the standard Shakespearian fare. This movie in particular is a very nice interpretation of this play. The costumes are wonderful and the actors (with the exception of the wooden Keanu Reeves) do a marvelous job with their roles. Keep an eye out for Keaton's sceen stealing presense! Branagh and Thompson are simply brilliant as Bennidick and Beatrice. Their word play comes off in a very natural way. If you are looking for a light hearted version of Shakespear I cannot think of a better way to go!
3,It's Okay!,I enjoyed this. But not everyone is into Shakespeare. The plot drags on. The acting is good and the scenes are sexy in parts. That's what makes a so so play interesting.
5,Another Point of View,"This film is pure fun from the start. The revelry and feeling of celebration carry on throughout. Emma Thompson is always a joy to watch, and the chemistry between her and then husband, Kenneth Branagh is amazing. Denzel Washington is just about perfectly cast as Don Pedro. I'm not overly impressed with Michael Keaton, as all I see is Beetlejuice all over again (and that movie was dumb the first time around). And now to address the disturbing trend of ""let's beat the crap out of Keanu Reeves"", I happen to think that although he may not be an Oscar winning actor, he was very beleivable in this role of the evil Don John. There are few who can convey such evil and bitterness with just a look, and Keanu Reeves did just that. I have always been a fan of Shakespeare's comedies, and this version has just reinforced my enjoyment of them. All in all a very lighthearted, heartwarming film that I would recommend to everyone, whether you are a Shakespeare fan or not."
4,Bright and Entertaining!,"Beautifully set in sunny, rural Italy, this movie is a great rendering of a light Shakespearean play. Of course, this is a comedy in the sense that it ends well but there are true comical moments throughout the movie and the overall mood is extremely upbeat.Everything is not perfect however. Spectators are implicitly asked to play along and accept various incongruities. Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson, for instance, are at least ten years too old for their parts. Also, it requires quite a leap of faith to acknowledge Robert Sean Leonard as Denzel Washington's brother. Finally, the mixture of British and American accents goes unexplained (but of course so does the fact that characters in the original play are Italian but speak English).Still, this highly enjoyable movie is recommended to all."
4,Very Enjoyable and Funny,"Much Ado is well written, funny, and has great acting. This is one of my 17 year old daughters favorite movies."
4,Wonderful Film,"Kenneth Branagh makes Shakespeare fun. The cast in this rendition of 'Much Ado About Nothing' is superb. From quirky to funny, angry to happy, each character has their part to play and each does it magnificently. Even Michael Keaton's small part was very memorable and hilarious for the short time he was on screen. I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking to enjoy a Shakespearean drama, or anyone just looking to watch a wonderful film."
4,Cute movie for a rainy day,"This flick is a very lively interpretation of Shakespeare's play Much Ado About Nothing. (For those of you who aren't familiar, take Romeo and Juliet + Taming of the Shrew, and you have Much Ado About Nothing). Performances are brilliant (if you're a fan of Robert Sean Leonard, you won't be disappointed), and the setting is absolutely gorgeous. I recommend it for a rainy day."
5,The great man himself would have approved of this rendering,. . .of his classic bit of frippery.An all star cast put in all star performances. No effort was spared to make it look and feel authentic.
5,A masterpiece of wit and interpretation of the bard's work.,"This is a film that can be watched again and again. The art of wit aproaches its highest form in this adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing. It surpasses the film ""Ridicule"" in its capturing of historic humor. When I viewed Much Ado About Nothing in a theater for the first time I was spellbound and it sparked an interest in Shakespear that has lasted for the past five years. I am delighted to own this video so that I can introduce my friends to Shakespear in one of the most enjoyable fashions."
4,Who says Shakespeare can't be fun?,"Beautifully photographed and brilliantly executed in the Tuscan sunshine, this film version captures all the energy and charm of Shakespeare's famous comedy. The cast is surprisingly long on Americans-thankfully NOT burdened here with those painfully fake English accents that we so often must endure-but under Branagh's excellent direction, even the unlikely casting of Keanu as the Bad Seed brother of Denzel's Don Pedro is not too hard to swallow (and Michael Keaton's constable is just classic comedy). Dialogue is condensed but true to the meter-and the ""meat""-of the original, and retains all the metaphor, pun, double-entendre and wordplay which reveal the Bard's genius. Branagh himself is thoroughly splendid as Benedick; as Beatrice, the always brilliant Emma Thompson has never been more lovely. Even those uninitiated who find Shakespeare incomprehensible will be surprised to be so charmed and entertained by this captivating film."
3,"I pull for Claudio, the Underdog","This may shock a lot of Shakespeare fans, but I really hate Beatrice! She is just as bad as Claudio, just as quick to judge and quick to condemn. I only saw this movie because they showed it on my vaction flight to England. I watched it only because of Branaugh and Thompson, and while my overall opinion of the play and the characters did not change, I believe it was well done. It proves the versatility of Denzel Washington, and I got to see Kate Beckinsale in an early role. I was hoping Emma Thompson's performance might help me see Beatrice in a better light, but it didn't. No offense to Ms. Thompson, but I pull for the Underdog."
5,pay no attention to razzi's review,"This movie is adorable...a terrific movie adaption of a very dense Shakespeare play - it's not small feat to trim it down to movie size and make it so touching and sweet - you won't be sorry; it's a very special treat -""silence is the perfectest herald of joy"""
4,Charming...,"The scenery is gorgeous, most of the acting fine, the music lovely, and the language, after all, belongs to Will Shakespeare. Unfortunately, this production suffers from K. Brannagh's editing. He cut out a lot of the play's funniest lines. Some would also argue that he darkened the plot inappropriately.Despite all that, I think it's one of the best of the recent Shakespeare movies. Brannagh and Thompson are great as two of Will's smartest lovers."
3,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING blu-ray 14/13 Alexander S Carter,"The transfer to blu-ray is very good; the performances, especially those of Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh, as Beatrice and Benedick, the sparing lovers.Not one of the Bards greatest comedies it is, never-the-less, a pleasant, non-mind-extending experience. The plot is rather weak; the comedy with Michael Keaton is just not funny, and the beautiful setting a little overpowering, but director Branagh keeps it all moving along nicely to its happy (PERHAPS) ever after ending."
4,A must have for fans of these bands!,"A slow-burning meditative listen. A must have for fans of Red House Painters, Low, Idaho, Misc or Hayden."
4,Engaging story and good resource.,"The storyline of this novel is a typical dungeoncrawl though engagingly written and well executed. The characters are given an unusual depth, especially Artek. Mr. Anthony has done a good job in portraying the wonder and horror of Undermountain. I consider this novel an excellent source for ideas and inspiration in my own campaign construction."
3,Very average,"This novel is well written and not a bad read, but nothing really sets it apart either. It comes off as pretty average, with cliche and not fully developed characters. You come away feeling as if you just read a book that was designed to sell a game supplement, which you did. Undermountain is a popular adventure in the Forgotten Realms, if there is a book written about it maybe it will sell even better. You won't feel as if you wasted your time with this book. There are better Forgotten Realms novels though, so unless you are a completest and have to read every realms novel, I would skip this one."
3,Not a true reflection of Mark Anthony's literary talent,"I really enjoyed the beginning of the book and the manner in which the reader is thrown headlong into the hustle and bustle of the Forgotten Realms world. I was however quite peeved to find that the characters featured in the prologue weren't the protagonists of the story. I would love to have known what happens with Savras's artifact, especially since it was so close to redemption from the forgotten shrine in Undermountain. The book itself was not as compelling as Mark Anthony's other work and I had the distinct feeling that the storyline had not been planned as well as it could have been. The plot had an ADLIB feel to it which was difficult to dispel. It was nontheless an enjoyable read, but unfortunately did not aspire to anything more than that."
3,"Hmmmm... Somehow, I feel unsatisfied.","Long, dreary. I wasn't thrilled, or in suspense. I did find the basic story not too bad, but felt a little ripped off in its depth. I would have to say I wasn't sold on the idea of the book."
1,Not a good buy,"These shoes are pretty awful and not because they are Minnesota Timberwolves shoes. The logos are attached very cheaply and the tongue feels like it covered with cheap plastic. The shoes are also very, very thin and I couldn't even wear the shoes. It is no wonder they got discontinued."
4,Warhouse Book,In this book the story is told by the horse which was a unique experience for me! The book is full of excitement and holds you attention well. A good portrait of the times in which it took place.
3,War Horse,"I looked forward to reading this book having heard such wonderful reviews however, it was disappointing and really turned out to be a book directed more to a younger reading age. It was cute more than it was exciting or interesting."
3,HONEST,this was a very comforting read . a remake of black beauty in 2012 . but im glaD I READ IT .VERY WELL WRITTEN.
4,YWPA Requirement,"The War Horse is a story about a horse named Joey who was taken away from his mother at a young age and was sold to a boy named Albert. The more Joey had grew the more Albert was attached, but one day Albert's father went into town with Joey and his other horse Zoey and sold Joey off to the army because Albert's father needed the money. The war horse is very strong and very interesting to the reader because Joey is the narrator of the story and everything that he had seen and everything that had happen he would say it or talk about it. I describe the war horse outstanding, breathtaking, and exciting. By: D. Wilson)"
2,$6.99 scholastic paperback edition ..,I have just been sent this book as a gift - this fantastic book which I am so glad has now come out in print in the US. I am very saddened however by the quality of this print - it is REALLY cheap - inking errors exist in it and the paperback cover and page paper quality is low - this print is unlikely to make it through being read by 3 children in my house. I have only bought from Scholastic at school sales and this seems the same quality as there - I was not expecting the same for a classic in the making ! Poor show Scholastic !
3,"World War I according to an eloquent, philosophical horse","War Horse is about World War I according to Joey, a literary, contemplative horse. The anthropomorphism itself is rather amusing. The horsey details are minimal. The horse's relationships with other horses and humans are sweet. His emotions--from friendship to fear--are touching. His eloquence rubs off on the humans who cross his path, such as a farm-boy-turned-soldier, who exclaims at the sight of another gorgeous horse, ""There's a nobility in his eye, a regal serenity about him."" (!) The same is true of the main horse-character's wisdom: anyone who strokes his nose--poof! turns into a philosopher. The whole cast is bent on speech making and rather good at it, if you like long-winded speeches. The book does a good job showing that there are good people on all sides of a war, but not as good a job showing that there are people of all types out there (including kind or mean).Yet this is a pleasant, quick read with an old-fashioned feel."
2,Go read the Black Stallion or Black Beauty.,"I spent the afternoon reading this novel little novel. I'm assuming it was written for children. Perhaps 12yr old boys?The plot is a twist on an old cautionary tale warning of the evils of war for they are destructive and serve no goodness.Using the horse as a tepid non biased narrator we are vaguely introduced to the characters in Europe during the First world war. Joey, a young horse is separated from his mother after he is purchased by a drunken abusive farmer at the weekly Tuesday market.After the brief and cool introductions to characters shallower than a wading pool we are taken on adventures with a horse who does seem to enjoy the life of hard good work.While the morals, principles and ideals of the story are good lessons, war is bad, promises are broken by death, friendship and love is eternal, the over all tone was weak and never truly left the reader with feelings of war-full dread and peril.Perhaps the movie will be more exhilarating."
3,Youth Story,"""War Horse"" was a really nice story. I saw movie previews and wanted to go, but decided to read the book instead. A simple little read more geared toward youth, but nice anyway. Good price for a good story. I love stories involving animals - but only if they end happy."
4,Good Book,War horse is a real good book . It was one of the first e books I read .Horses are my favorite books . I know when you read this book you might wonder how they could make a movie out of it and so I am going to have to see the movie too.
3,A sweet little story,War Horse is another horse tale which is probably geared best to young teen-agers. I enjoyed this short workand found the author's knowledge of World War One to be quite good. It was very readable and could be finishedeasily in an afternoon. I hope that the author aspires to more sophisticated work in the future.
4,Great read,Saw the movie first....I don't normally do that but of course the book is much better than the movie. A really enjoyable read.
5,Brill,"Very easy read , would recommend this book to friends and family love how the book was written from horses perspective very heart warming story"
4,More than just a story of a horse...an insight to war.,"By just examining the cover of this book, all sorts of children will be attracted to reading this novel - boys interested in war along with girls interested in horses. That being said, you're getting a book which delivers much more than a story on war and horses. Morpurgo discusses themes mostly only found in adult novels. Intimate friendships, devotion, dedication, love, angst, and sacrifice. This story is indeed about a horse and his owner, but goes much deeper than that. I highly recommend this novel to any child and adult (young or old) looking for a quick, yet memorable read. Let's hope the movie doesn't ruin this story!"
5,A Great Piece of Historical Fiction,"War Horse follows the story of Joey, a farm horse, throughout World War I. It's a great story of triumph, perseverance, love and devotion. Centered around World War I, Joey finds himself fighting for both sides and losing loved ones along the way. It's wonderful for both boys and girls, as everyone can relate and is more empathetic towards animals. This is a great book for middle schoolers and would be great to use in the classroom! I highly recommend this book, though, for all ages."
5,A Story that Pleases on many Levels,"I became intrigued about this story from a friend who had a stopover in London and saw the play. He related the presentation of the horse on stage and how technical with various movements. I was interested in the background where the story originated. So I looked up Amazon.com website and queried the information. As usual, Amazon had the book and other background information. I ordered the book and it met my expectations. When they (Spielberg) produces the full-length movie, I hope they don't hollywoodize too much. Although the senselessness of World War I could be emphasized. Not many knew what they were fighting for and did not know they were sowing seeds for the Second World War. However, this is a great horse story within a historical setting. I think tagging it further would demean it."
3,Not impressed...,"I just finished reading this book and, sadly, I was not that impressed with it. I'm hoping that the movie is better. If this book is being read as a children's book--fine. It's a nice little story. As an adult's book, it lacked something that I just can't put my finger on. I'll recommend it, but only to younger kids."
2,Another Morpurgo,"He must be good...MM sells so many books, has such a record of kindness to children...this one is a film, a stage play, presented all over the world...Well, I'm sorry: I think it's trite, formulaic, and does less justice to the WWI warriors than it could!Of course horse and rider will be re-united at end of book, just as they are in 'Black Beauty'; of course this horse will survive, and come home, when millions were killed or sold off to the French. Kids want a happy ending...don't they? Once again MM serves it up."
5,loved it!,Loved loved loved loved this book! Can not wait for the movie to come out. This book would I think be enjoyed by all age's.
5,Best book I have read in years!,"Written from the horse's point of view, the book gives insight into the animal's feelings and anxieties while experiencing separation from his beloved master and the atrocities of war. Well written and a real page turner!"
5,A wonderful horse story,"I never knew this book ever existed, until I saw the trailer to the movie on facebook. Saw this at kmart the other day, and decided to pick it up. Boy am I ever glad I did. Although short, its an excellent read, with a very powerful, anti-war message. Took me a couple of days to finish it, and I am not disappointed. I also liked that the book was not totally biased against the enemy, and showed that some of the germans Joey encountered were compassionate human beings, who also despised the war, and didn't want to be there. The coin toss between (friendly)enemies, to determine Joeys ownership in the end was also awesome.I will definitely read this again, and I can't wait to see the movie!"
5,War Horse,"A great historical novel that only touches on the tragedy of World War I and the fact that a great deal of the young men sent to battle on both sides, never returned."
5,"Joey, the war horse",This story is about a horse called Joey who from hos age as a young colt is sold to a farmer. He becomes friends with a boy called Albert abd they live happily together. However the farm encountrs rough times and the farmer has to sell Joey to the army. Joey encounters all the terrors and dangers of WW1 and makes many new friends along the way.
4,Book,Wanted to read the book before I saw the Movie...very easy read...more like a childrens' book. At least now I know how it ends.
3,Interesting but too short,Written from the point of view of the horse made it interesting. It was way too short and did not achieve the depth that i would have preferred.
5,the best,"this book was exciting and its a ""cant put it down"" book i loved it and cant wait to see the movie"
4,"Good, easy read.",This book was definitely a fast read. There aren't a lot of names to remember and the story line is relatively simple. I like how the book is written from the horse's point of view. If you cry easily you will want to keep a tissue box close by. The end was good but a little vague.
5,Soon to be a Classic!,"This book is INCREDIBLE. The storytelling is breath taking! Although the book deals with a tough subject, and does deal with animals in pain, and somewhat abusive situations, it does so in a way that doesn't make you want to stop reading the story mid-way through.I read this book in one sitting, and have never fallen so completely in love with a novel as quickly as I did with this one! This is a book that should be read by every child and I am sure will one day be a classic. I rate it right next to Black Beauty.....in fact it may even be BETTER- and trust me that's saying A LOT!This book will definitely have a permanent spot on my bookshelf!"
2,"Could have used more ""oomph""","I ride and I love history so it was a no-brainer for me to get this book. It was good, but a really easy read. Seems to have been written for Jr or Sr High School kids...I would recommend it, but dont expect too much detail or depth."
1,STUPID!,"Have you ever wondered how animals think? Well lots of people say yes, BUT they don't understand that animals and humans can't understand each other by talking! If you say, ""Oh, Bob and I bought some pizza yesterday, it tasted good!"" in a happy tone the animal (example- horse or dog) will not understand you got pizzza but will understand you are happy.In this stupid book the horse understands that you and Bob ate Pizza. Animals can't dot that! This would be an OK book for say, a second grader BUT it is not fit for say a fourth grader. This book is not realistic enough.I am a 12 year old writting this review. I read this book. SUCH a dissapointment. I rarely read any good horse books. If you want a good book written from an animal point of view get ""A Dog's Purpose"" (no talking animals, no animals understanding human talk, all object described from a dog point of veiw, it's my favorite book I promise you that a dog's purpose is good)This Book is so STUPID!"
1,war horse,"Thought this was a follow up to the orginal War Horse. No indication that this was a play. Awfull, just awfull. A real way to waist your money. I threw it away. No indication when it was purchased that it was a play."
1,As always I get extremely nervous about children's books ...,... that are exclusively reviewed by adult readers.I treasure kids' reviews and this book doesn't have any. Am I buying a didactic and gold-plated moralistic Lesson? The Newbery winners are almost exclusively of this ilk.I have a single criterion when selecting books for my grandchildren: will it further addict them to reading?It's so hard ...
4,loved,REally enjoyed this. The book is so much better than the movie. Kept my attention and I enjoyed it. it's different.
5,war horse,i would read it. it is one of the best books i have read a must read the book is great read it.
3,Not as good as the movie,"I really enjoyed the movie, but I can barely tell how it came from this book. Some of the characters & situations were similar. Oddly, there was far more character development in the movie. The book is told from the point of view of the horse, so it might make sense that there was not much emotional depth, but it just felt dry.I don't recommend the book. I do recommend the movie."
4,Equistrian enthusiast creator,"I grew up on a modern cattle ranch without any horses on it. I have rode many of my friend's horses to pass the time, but have never considered.myself a horse person, I have seen many people have the relationship with a horse where they can simply make a noise and it obeys, willingly. They could look into the horses eye and know what wrong. Albert and Joey our main characters have this and retain it, no matter how violently the world tries to violently rip it from them."
5,All the conflicts and struggles of battle.,"Michael Morpurgo's WAR HORSE tells of war horse Joey, who began life as a farm horse with a gentle boy master and was sold into the army during World War I. Fans of Black Beauty and other classic animal stories will find this first-person horse's eye story of war and change brings to dramatic life all the conflicts and struggles of battle."
5,"I have not read the book yet, but want to clarify...","I have not read the book yet, but plan to since I loved the movie. I am just leaving this to clarify that this is, in fact, a novel and NOT A PLAY! Ok, that's it. Not a play. I will get back to you with a real review when I have read this:War Horse: (Movie Cover)"
5,War Horse The Movie,"I have not read the book yet,but the movie was Awesome!.If you never seen the movie you So should watch it,because i know you will Love it!Best movie sense Titanic!!.....But of course TITANIC will always be my favorite.Hahaha <3 :)"
3,Good for children,"I didn't realize before starting the book that it was written for children. Even so, it was a unique (though perhaps sanitized) perspective of life before during WWI. Using the device of the horse narrator the author was able to show that people on both sides of a conflict are basically the same."
5,The Horse of the century.,"As a long time horse owner and great lover, I loved this book. I shed a lot of teats and had many wonderful and some sad memories over the years. I am eighty-four years old and would still like to be ridding a horse if my health permitted but I am faced to just relax and love the memories. War Horse was well written and easy to understand for all ages. I congradulate the author and would read more of his books."
3,Great for kids,But I couldn't get past a couple chapters. The writing was sporadic and jumped back and forth. I love the idea of telling a story through the horse's point of view though. I guess I'll just watch it in theaters and give this book to the kids.
4,War Horse,"War HorseFrom Amazon.comI heard the movie was worth going to see. I like to read the book first, if available. The book was really very differnt than any book I've read. It was told from the horses perspective. I was on a long car ride so, I got my reader out and read.I had to laugh out loud a couple times, at myself for reading about a horse from a horse. It takes place during WW1 when horses were used on front lines by officers on both sides of the war. They were also used to pull wagons to pick up wounded soldiers. A lot of horses died and were badly mistreated. But they had some good people in the story also. I finished it and talked about it with my daughter inlaw. She was a little skepticle, and gave me the mother in-law look. But really the book was very good, and I would recomend it."
2,dissapointed,"Was very dissapointed, was kinda short kept and expected more storyline or maybe more detailed specifications.I expected more to be honest :("
4,Can't wait to see movie,"I was able to borrow the audio version from the library. About half-way finished I realized that I just had to have the Kindle version. This story was worth it. It is told from the horse's point of view, yet it evoked full human emotions. I laughed out loud a couple of places then had tears streaming down my face in others. Now I have to see the movie."
5,War Horse-GREAT,This was my first purchase of a book on my kindle. Very easy to do!!! Also a great book to purchase for your kindle! A must read before going to the movie to watch it!!!
4,semper fidelis,what i loved most about this story is the horse being the narrator...if your an animal lover especially dogs and horses you will love this story..it's also a fast read
5,Great Horse Story - Children's Literature,"This is a touching book that kept my interest all through. Although it is a children's book, I enjoyed it but must admit I got teary-eyed reading it. Parts were very sad but I loved the ending! Joey, the horse, tells his story about living on a farm with a boy named Albert and then being sold to the army because Albert's dad needed money to save his farm. The horse goes through a lot but Albert never gives up looking for him. This is the story of a loving bond between a horse and his owner. It's a easy quick read."
3,War Horse,"The story is good but the book is less realistic and dramatic than the movie. I found the anthropomorphic telling of the story from the horses point of view quite old fashioned. It is, I think, a book written for teen agers but the style is weak compared with modern teenage books"
4,It was good,"A good book, however, it was kind of sad.A good medium sized book, it only took me a couple hours to read."
5,Awesome,This is a very good book l love it . It also was sad :( . But other than that it was awesome:)
4,Great Strings,"You can really notice the difference. Not too BRIGHT... not too ""muddy""... just right. They last a long time... I play about 3 - 4 hours per week and have not noticed a difference in sound for over 8 months. Been thinking about changing them because I feel guilty but not sure they really need it."
2,High E string flat as a chess board,"I switched over from DR to Elixir and was I disappointed! These are twice the price and if they do not work for you, you feel really bad. I personally had problems with the high E. It came out really really flat, with or without fretting. The other strings sounded OK. They seemed to have more bass and sounded warmer than the DRs. As a beginner, I am going to stick to the DRs for now."
5,Excellent!!,I have been playing with these strings every day for a month and they still sound like the day I put them on. They are definitely worth the extra money.
1,Has everyone gone deaf?,"I have two Martin dreadnought spruce topped guitars. One was strung with Martin Marquis Custom Lights the other with these Gortex things. Um... In nearly 30 years of playing I've never heard strings sound quite this bad. They turned my Martin into something you'd buy in the toy department of Target. Shrill, lifeless, unbalanced, with dissonant overtones. Truly horrible. I actually wrote to Gore and demanded my money back (first time I've ever done anything like that). Stick to strings from a music manufacturer not a coat maker.UPDATE: I heard back from Gore today. They said they do not offer refunds on their products, but they're sending me another set of strings. So I tell them their strings are terrible and they say ""here, have some more""...very logical."
3,"LAST FOREVER, SOUND IS OKAY",I have been on the journey for the perfect strings for my acoustic guitar. I tried these out for a couple of months. These strings sound good. They last forever. It took me a while to figure out that the guitar sounded like nanoweb strings. I know it sounds weird but when i put on any other brand the guitar took on whole different tones and the wood vibrated in my chest. Each time i would come back to Elixir the sound was flat and too bright. The high end was kind of screwy. I am a fingerstyle blues player (pre-war). I also play rock and folksy stuff. Some people swear by them. I just find EXP and ej16's to make the guitar sound better.
5,FRIGG'N AWESOME SHOE,"This is the best shoe I've ever owned. I have bought my second pair after running my 2nd marathon and I'll run my 3rd in these. Excellent motion control and support without a lot of weight. The 7 layeres of padding (you can see them at www.asics.com) don't wear out easy so you can train, train, train, and run a long time on these."
1,Needs improvement,"2 weeks after purchase the sensor broke off and i contacted pintech and they refused to warranty item, so I will not purchase this brand in the future."
2,Meh,"The cymbal seems to trigger ok, but I am not at all impressed with how flimsy it is, you can practically bend it in half which gives it an extremely weird feel when playing."
4,Viva La Mambo,"""A Little Bit Of Mambo In My Life"" by Tito Puente and others, should not be confused with the more contemporary CD of the same name by Lou Bega. (I liked that one too, see my review) On this CD we are treated to 16 energetic tracks of some of the best traditional Latin music ever written.And no, these are not just songs one hears at a Fred Murray Dance Studio. We are treated to such Latin classics as ""Girl From Ipanema"", ""Mambo Inferno"", and ""El Yo Yo"". Well arranged tracks and good audio mixing enhance this contagious disc of Mambo rhythms.Catch Latin fever & dance the night away--cha cha cha!other musical suggestions: ""Buena Vista Social Club"" by Ry Cooder et al and ""A Little Bit Of Mambo"" by Lou BegaYour interest & comments are appreciated--CDS"
5,A Stable Support For Your Knee,The fabric in the knee support is what really makes this item a must own. It will keep your knee comfortable as well as keeping your knee durable in any kind of situation. This pad will keep your body part stable as you will be keep blood flowing to the knee with the help ofAcute Knee Support- 3 Bottles/ 1 Month Supply. All- Natural Herbal Remedy for Knee Pain Lasting Less Than 3 Months. Eliminate Knee Pain Quicker Than You've Ever Thought Possible!. This is simple product that indeed does it jobs as fits nicely onto your knee.
1,Uncomfortable.,"The OTC brace is impossible to wear more than 15-20 minutes. The problem is in the materials used: coarse, synthetic fabric and stiff, scratchy stitching. It makes me wonder whether the people who made this thing ever bother to test their own products. A waste of money."
2,Doesn't Stay on knee,"I was used to much more support when wearing a brace but this wasn't for me. It tended to slip down my knee, if your looking for something simple maybe this is for you"
4,knee suport,"How wonderful, when your knees go out, these can support and help you walk to do daily task such as get up and get dressed each morning."
4,Helpful,The brace was the right fit and helps with the joint pain from walking and standing. The only issue with it is that it does not stay in place under clothing and under constant use.
2,OTC ORTHOTEX KNEE SUPPORT,"This product has been of no use for two reasons. First, though I measured myself and selected the appropriate size, it is simply too large by at least one size. Second, it is not as robust as the picture would suggest. I do not plan to grow into it; perhaps an alternative use will occur to me. Suggestions?"
5,Great Fun,"This was a gift for my son and he loved it. He's 6 at the time so abuses of toys are natural. However, it took him 2 yrs to break the weakest part of the lightsaber (the very end of the blade). For my money, that's real good value. Obviously if you are using it to try for real jedi fights and you are really smacking it hard, maybe your opinion of the durability will be less. However, I thought it was a great toy, great sound, and great fun.One funny story I have to share as far as the power of product marketing goes is this. My son was CONVINCED that when it said ""Force Action"" on the box, that meant NOT that it made noise and stuff when you hit/swung it, but that if he placed it on the ground, strained and pointed your hand at it, the light saber would leap into his hand. My wife & I absolutely roared when he did it the first time. It took some bit of explaining that no matter what the box said, Force powers were movie magic. Priceless moment though."
1,Not what I expected,"When I received this item, I was surprised that it looks nothing like the item I thought I purchased. It is a Dwink product, but it looks like a much cheaper version. It is a solid dark blue with ""Dwink"" cut out into the plastic, and it does not bow out like the old one we had (which looks like the picture on Amazon.com), so smaller juice boxes do not fit as they should. I was very disappointed and am sending it back for a refund."
4,Best out there so far,I thought this holder was fantastic. It's cute and it works! The design allows it to hold all of the different brands of juices that I buy at the market. No other drink box holder fits everything. A BIG plus is that the dwink box is made in the USA!
5,wonderful,This juice box holder is beyond wonderful. It prevents the juice from the juice box or juice bag from squirting up.
5,The only bib for self feeder!,We have had these bibs around our home for 3 years now. I have 1 toddler a preschooler and one on the way. Have never had any problems with them. They are washable and dry-able. The only thing starting to show wear is the Velcro which is easy to replace.
2,disappointed,this bib is not long. i was disappointed to find out that it only reaches my daughters torso.
3,Great coverage but material doesn't last long,"I bought this bib about 4 months ago for our son. I love that it covers him completely and that is made of a light fabric. Oh, the pockets are nice too. Unfortunately, over time the bib has accumulated mold in the fabric (not something you can wipe off), even despite the fact that we hang it up to dry after washing it. Putting it in the washing machine didn't even help. So unfortunately we will have to throw it away."
1,From an interested reader,"The topic is interesting, but the treatment is superficial -- so superficial I had a hard time even following the plot. The world needs a strong, well-written book about John Marshall and his role in forging modern America. Unfortunately, this book isn't it. If you're interested in the period, Ellis's two biographies of Jefferson and Adams are much better."
5,Sturdy Baking Dish,This dish is both attractive (with basket weave) and practical. I use it for many desserts and casseroles. Great buy!
1,Something wrong,"Everything was looking great.The shipping was fine with a little delay.The device is awesome, its small with big sound and good quality.And the design is simple and this is what I like about it, with enough 512mb flash memory.But...The only main problem that makes me mad is that it came with dead battery. I tried to charge it many times with the provided USB charger but it's only working when the power is plugged in."
1,Poor Quality! Dead in 2 days,"The product description is not correctThis player do not have SD slot, but it can show 7 colorsIt is tiny for a MP3 player with built-in speakers.However, the quality is the most terrible part of this unit, dead in two days!When I turn on the power, it just shows logo and THAT'S IT.Reset the unit several times but no luck.Worst quality ever!"
5,My oldies,"This CD is great, the best son there is. Anyone who likes Cuban son, should buy it. Better to go to Santiago de Cuba and listen to them live at Casa de la Trova. The lead-singers are my Cuban ""abuelos"" as long as they live.It's a pity that so far Amazon does not sell their latest CD: Óyeme Cachita!, also a Corason edition. Look for it!"
4,Reprint - But a Great Summer Read,"I love Sandra Brown's early books. No, they don't require a lot of thought, they stay on the story line without twists or melodrama, the heros are likeable, the romance is hot, the story line is original, and they are a quick enjoyable evening or afternoon read.In this story we have Leigh Branson, a young pregnant widow who, eight months ago, had lost her husband Greg-a narcotics agent shot on a raid. Leigh insists never again will she fall for a guy who works such a risky job. Leigh goes into labour while driving and pulls over on the highway. Meet Chad Dillon, our handsome hero who pulls his truck over to the side to help deliver the baby. But Chad too has a dangerous job. And so the story rolls as attraction and love win the day. Fun read."
4,"A Little Overused, But Still Good","The beginning of the novel was interesting--a stranded woman on a side of a Texas country road giving birth to a baby with only the help of a stranger who happens to be rather cute, and she never sees him again... until some time later. I felt that toward the end (20 bucks says you can guess), the storyline started to get a little sappy, but hey, after awhile you start to expect that in romances."
4,"Good, quick read","Leigh was a resourceful, independant woman. She made a life for herself and her daughter without relying on anyone else. Chad was a caring man and while relentless in his pursuit of Leigh was not arrogant about it. The only problem I had was Chad not telling Leigh so much about his life until she found out. She knew his name but nothing about his job, home, family background, financial status or his past. He did it because he was afraid he would lose her if he told her too soon. While he may have felt he had good reason for his actions he still deceived her and she accepted it a little too readily. Other than that I liked the characters."
4,i love the story....,Chad's character reminds me so much of my husband....their love to their partner is so great...
2,Too sappy!,This might have been written in 1992 but there were still things in it that were old fashioned even for 12 years ago. This book was just a little too sappy for my tastes. Chad was a little too pushy and Leigh too much of a pushover. I've read much better Sandra Brown books.
5,Excelente DVD,"El DVD es de muy buena calidad visual y sonora y trae muy buena información instructiva con buenas ideas de como ver y expresarse con la Bateria. Trae ejercicios y temas tocados muy buenos, Benny Greb toca con mucho sentimiento y es de mis favoritos, lo recomiendo"
2,Good to a point.,"Most of the proofs that the Morrises give are well thought-out with good evidence. However, when they start talking about creation, they base their proofs on traditions instead of scripture and natural revelation. No matter how hard the Morrises try, their personal creation theology has never stood up. This section stands out like a sore thumb out of what could have been a great book."
3,"Careful when using the word ""Infallible""","Overall, the book is very good. Biblical creationism is spot-on--this is where Morris shines. My bone to pick with the book centers around the nature of Hell, and I can't see how Morris could make some of the statements he does and place them in a book titled ""Infallable"".In the section regarding Hell, Morris describes the fate of those people as perhaps residing in the center of some distant star (since spirit can't burn, and yet the Bible mentions fire in Hell). This is in absolutely no way in the Bible and should not have been proffered as a truth. It is much better to admit that we don't know all the answers than to spin our own human speculation. Such speculation diminishes the testimony of Christianity.Praise God there are infallable truths out there. God has revealed himself in nature and through natural processes and Morris shines a light on those through the Bible."
3,"No ""Drum Hat Buddah""","Well, I was introduced to these artists by their newest album ""Drum Hat Buddah"" - an amazing work where every song gets stuck in your head. So, I started working backwards and purchased this album next. To be honest, I was very dissapointed because it was not nearly as good as ""DHB"". Every song is okay - no bad song among them - but at the end of my listening to the album a couple of times, I had none of the songs still ringing in my ears."
5,one of the best cuban compilations you'll find,"ok, everyone here recommended Sierra Maestra's ""El Reloj De Pastora"", and while it's good - no doubt about it, my soul has bonded to another track.it is track no. 6, ""Mecanica de Amor"", which I deeply regret Amazon not putting a sample of it on this site, just so everyone will become instantly addicted to it as I have. I am listening to it right now. Bliss.The magic of that song is the use of violins instead of the usual brass instruments. There isn't a trumpet to be found here. as a result the sound is softer, and much richer. I can also say that all my salsero friends here in Israel agree that this is the best track on this CD. my best guy friends crowned it (I quote): ""it's a masterpiece!""other highlights: song no. 8 (""Boliviana"", wonderful wonderful harmony), and song no. 5 (""Sabroso Como El Guarapo""). Both feature wonderful flute solos, especially ""Boliviana"", which is on the jazzier side.Just buy the CD. Now."
4,An excellent compiltation that contains something new (at last!),"Most of the times, when a ""cuban"" compilation comes to my hands, it either contains the same and the same songs or it's just disappointing. This is a magnificent exception to this! This collection really represent the ""Cuban"" spirit without repeating the well-known songs. If you like this particular style you're going to love this CD and if you're unfamiliar with it you're also gonna love it!A highly recommended title, surely worth buying... The one and only con i found is that it's length is rather short (about half-an-hour) just like all the titles from the ""Putumayo"" series - at least every single track is worth it :)"
1,No Cuba,This is not Cuba! Not original music anyway. My expectations were too high and this product missed the mark.I listened a couple of times and gave it away. Sorry. I know Cuban music and I wanted Cuban music. Sorry!
5,An excellent introduction to performing magic,"This light-hearted book pleasantly surprised me. It manages to teach a broad range of effects while emphasizing the real goal of performing magic, which is to entertain an audience by providing a moment of astonishment. It also lists resources for anyone inspired to continue beyond this introduction. I thought it was well done, and suitable for interested beginners of any age."
3,A decent starting point and/or thought starter,"Magic for Dummies is very thorough, giving runthroughs of several different magic tricks. The patter, as written in the book, is exceedingly lame, but c'mon...What kind of showman would you be if you couldn't take a main idea and make it your own by writing better patter, right? A good thought starter and a nice insight into the simple mechanics of simple tricks. A decent addition to the library."
5,The book really got me into the hobby of magic,This book is great for beginners and advanced magicians. Its a great book!
2,"Good advice, Old tricks","Have you ever looked a Magic Kit. They almost always promise ""over a hundred magic tricks inside."" As a kid I bought the kit and ran home only to find props for four or five tricks and a book titled ""A hundred tricks anyone can do."" It was usualy a reprint of a book over 50 years old. The tricks were good, but most were bar bet sort of tricks. Amusing, but YOU want to learn ""magic."" That is why you used it as a keyword. There are a few good tricks in this book, but most can be found in any book in your local library. If you a curious about tricks PLEASE start there. If you know a few tricks and want to take the next step in becoming a ""Magician,"" than this book is not without merits. The cartoons are great, the ""cheat sheet"" should be committed to memory, and the history of magic makes it a must read. If you want to learn some basic, well worn, tricks, save your money and grab your library card. If you know a few tricks and want to develope, this is a good place to start."
3,Just okay,"Being a visual learner, this book isn't as helpful as some others. Youtube has been much more helpful for learning magic tricks, and it is free."
3,One Step Back,"1980's One Step Closer ended the Michael McDonald era of the band. Following the monster success of Minute By Minute, Mr. McDonald took creative control of the band on this release. The album is essentially a solo album for him. One Step Closer isn't a bad album, it just isn't anywhere as good as the previous effort. ""Real Love"" is a brilliant song and is as good as anything the band has ever done. The song was a top ten hit (peaking at number 5) and nothing else on the album compares to it. After a final tour, the band broke up and went their separate ways. They reunited in 1989 (sans Mr. McDonald) for the Cycles album."
4,A True Group Effort,"Few groups are able to drastically change their musical direction and maintain their popularity. Somehow, the Doobies were able to pull it off, with great success. I'm sure it was difficult for a lot of fans to swallow the sweet soulful sounds of Michael McDonald when they were expecting the chunky rhythms of Tom Johnston's guitar. No doubt the Doobies lost fans from the Johnston camp but gained listeners who appreciated the new sound.One Step Closer continued a string of albums tailor made for top 40/smooth jazz type stations. Overall, the songs are catchy, and you get the feeling that all the members left their mark on the album. Real Love and One Step Closer are the clear standouts, but Keep This Train A-Rollin'and Just In Time are excellent tracks as well."
5,A high water mark of comicbook work...,"Just prior to hanging up his comicbook hat to focus on oil painting (and why not when he can earn between $100,000-$250,000 per gallery show)... Dave Cooper gave us this book, Ripple, which in my mind is his very best work. There's something about the scratchy art that perfectly matches the lasciviousness of the story. It's a wonderful example of an original story by an original cartoonist. You won't read or see anything like it from another.One of my most favorite books ever. I can't recommend it enough.-Bobby.N"
5,Wonderful Classic Story,Great story for any boy or girl. If you are reading this for required reading it is a great pick. Not too old fashion. Easy to understand. Inspirational story.
5,A must have,A wonderfully creative book that any educator would be proud to use in their classroom. My students love it!
3,all right,"This is a fairly cutesy movie, which was rather popular for its era - LOTS of movies came out within around a decade (1985-1995) and some of them were awesome while others not so much. Personally, I didn't think this movie was great, but I also didn't think it was a terrible film, either. It features talking animals on a mission to help and save their friends, which was a common storyline for these animated films."
5,"Typical and cute 90's cartoon, but educating","Like 'Fern Gully', 'Once Upon A Forest' can learn us something about our endangered nature, this cartoon is about a group of Furlings, who is going out on a daring adventure to find a plant that can save one of their friends lives."
5,a good movie,I thought this was a great movie!!(for walt diseny). I recomend children of all ages see it!!!
2,Once Upon a Review,"This is the kind of movie that somebody's grandmother might get for their daughter so that the parent in question can pawn off the responsibility of raising his daughter on some awful movie. Then, when the child comes to him upset and with questions he can say that he ""innocuously"" put it in the DVD player thereby further removing himself from any blame. Perhaps he can then direct his daughter to another awful video about death and dying."
4,childhood favorite!,Bought for teenager who loved watching it as a kid on VHS tapes! Now he has it on dvd. Great movie.
5,Community. Community. Where's my community?,"Deleon-Granados employs a narrative style of case studies to support his thesis that top-down approaches to community policing have failed. Agencies cannot simply ""order up"" or impose a community to create social control among the citizenry. Functioning communities grow from the ground up, though opportunities do exist for public and private agencies to foster and support positive channels. Though covering an academic topic, Deleon-Granados avoids the jargon and esoterica normally found in such treatments. His narrative approach renders an easy read of a tough subject."
5,Youth and our communities,Granados' book has given me much to think about. It has changed my approach to working within my community.
5,Keep this one handy . . .,This is a book that you will want to pick up and read select chapters time and again. The wisdom in this book is just what you need when in a contemplative spirit. John Carmody gives sound advice in teaching you to map out a course that leaves you feeling in control and able to cope. Keep this in your favorite reading spot because it is slow reading; you read a little and think a lot.
5,A Good Book!,"Cathy says:John Carmody's ""How to Handle Trouble"" is turly a useful book. I highly recommend reading it!"
4,A good book,"This is a very good book if you are having bad times. Carmody provides no-nonsense advice and philosophy on how to deal with death or pain. His spirituality is present throughout the work, but is not in your face. Very good starter for anyone looking for something beyond a self-help book."
3,Good film,"Although, this is a good classic film, the quality is poor and very hard to concentrating and grasp entire plot due to poor printing."
2,The Region 2 Sets Are Far Superior !,If you want better quality prints for this great old series go to amazon.com.uk and buy the region 2 sets. They have all 4 seasons 5 disc per season struck from original negatives. The region 1 sets are from poor public domain prints crammed on 3 discs quality ranging from poor to good. You will have to have an all region player that converts pal to ntsc to play region 2 these are cheap now some are available at walmart and on e-bay.
1,Robin Hood series two/not good quality,"Hi everyoneI was a fan of TV show and enjoy watching it when I was young and was please to get it on DVD. The first I got was the second series of Robin Hood from Amazon UK and the quality and sound was great and the price was good and well package and you got 5 disc with all 39 episodes.When I saw the Amazon (US) that had the first complete season of The adventures of Robin Hood. I was not happy from the company Mill CreekIt was from the US CBS. The picture quality was poor and did not show well on LCD TV. It was disappointing from this company to make this product there was no remastering or improve quality. The old saying goes ""you get what you pay for Elcheapo""Mike from Australia"
3,"Robin Hood, Richard Greene season 1 & 2",It was nice to watcb one of my favorite shows of the 50's. I am also looking forward to getting season 3 & 4 of Richard Greene's Robin Hood.
5,Adventures of Robin Hood Complete 2nd Season,"Very enjoyable return to yesteryear! These wonderful B&W, high quality episodes are truly fun to watch, with much historical accuracy in dress, storyline, settings and locale. Can't wait until the 3rd season becomes available!"
3,American Air Rifles,"This book is an excellent introduction to air rifles, pellets and the ballistics of air rifles. It would serve as a good guide to someone interested in purchasing an air rifle for hunting or plinking. The cover indicates that it covers target shooting, small-game hunting, complete ballistics and pellet selection. The latter three items are covered. However, there is essentially no information on target shooting or rifles designed for target shooting. I realize that the book is limited to American air rifles, but at least the Daisy Avanti models could have been included. There was also a lack of discussion of triggers, a critical rifle component for accurate shooting. I would have rated the book at least 4 stars, if it had not given the impression on the front cover that it included target shooting and target rifles, which was the reason that I bought it."
4,so excited,Purchased this DVD for GrandDaughter's birthday. She loved it! She even noticed that it went with the Princess Shortcake doll.
5,Great movie for my 3 year old daughter,Bought this for my daughter who is 3. This is a great addition to the collection and she loves it. I would always recomend Amazon and any products offered through their Prime services.
1,Whiny,"The Berryfest Princes is very whiny compared to the other movies. All the characters are complaining, arguing, and whining in the Berryfest Princess.The little ladybugs are incredibly annoying and constantly arguing with each other. Strawberry is consistently flustered and overwhelmed, every one acts self-centered and at one point they are all crying. Oh yes, and Strawberry Shortcake calls herself the ""leader"" to her friends throughout the movie.The Glimmerberry Ball Festival and Sky's the Limit are so much better than this one. Those are cuter and the characters are all just friends, rather than the hierarchy this movie presents."
2,Too Glammed Up For Little Girls,"I was a fan of Strawberry Shortcake as a girl and was excited when they first brought her back a few years ago. It is nice NOT to have evil villains that are super scary! This new, new Strawberry Shortcake was disappointing and disturbing. The girls act and look more like teenagers instead of little girls. The plot, or lack thereof, in this movie is just painful! It is so sad to see yet another character lose their child-like innocence."
5,Swwet and has good lessons!,"What little kid doesn't dream about being a princess? Well, I can answer that since my 4 year old son loves this whole series. In fact, he received this DVD for this (Strawberry Shortcake themed) birthday this year. He and his 7 year old sister can be found watching this DVD over and over.I enjoy this series too. Mostly, the girls are funny, sometimes shallow and sometime emotional but always reminding each other that their friendships are the most important thing. They often tie in themes about respecting one another, working together, friendship and caring.All 5 characters have different qualities that both of my children seem to enjoy, but mostly Plum for dancing and Lemon for being a little 'flighty'.I have no complaints about this series, this movie or the most recent redesign of the characters."
2,No English subtitles,"When ordering this DVD from Amazon I probably missed the remark that there are no English subtitles. Had I read it, I would have refrained from ordering.Why? It't the music that counts, you'll argue. True, to a certain extend. But I wish to understand what the songs are about, and subtitles in Italian don't help much. Strangely enough the narration (on screen) by Turturro himself are in English.So no, I'm not satisfied with this item the way it has been marketed. Yet I will refrain from lodging a complaint, seeing how other customers, who had the same complaint, have tried in vain to get a refund from distributor Veco.Am I disappointed? Yes, certainly."
1,terrible response,Have still not heard from veco the italian company need your help I was prommissed in a passed e that i would be contacted disappointed that amazon would be selling dvd that are zone 2 thank you
5,Thrilling,A glorious film of wonderful music. Really exciting. I have watched it a number of times already and am eagerly awaiting the soundtrack CD. It has opened up a fabulous new world for me. I have the Italian DVD and I can't wait for an English subtitled version to come out now as I would love to know more about what is being sung and said. And I would love it to have a director's commentary too. And maybe some extra numbers? Thank you so much John Turturro for this magnificent movie.
4,Parli Italiano?,"This is a vastly enjoyable movie. It's a kind of documentary, but you wouldn't think it. John Tutturo is clearly passionate about the culture that produced this rich and varied smorgasbord of song and music, and it infuses the whole production. The diversity of representations, visual as well as musical, is inspiring. We first saw this in a film festival, and were able enrich our grasp of the content because the song lyrics were subtitled in English. Not so with this DVD. If you don't speak Italian, the subtitles (which translate the Neapolitan dialect into standard Italian) won't help much. I admit I'm annoyed that this isn't made clear in the dvd info. Like another reviewer, I'd love to see the English subtitled version, anytime soon."
3,It's about...,"finding your passion in Italy, whether singing, dancing or both. I gave it 3 stars. It is kind of slow and repetitive."
4,"A bit dry, but full of invaluable advice","This book is a great source of inspiration for those who have big ideas of starting a business but not much money to do it with.The author talks about negotiating loans and credit from suppliers, buying fixtures, decorating the interior of your business cheaply, the importance of incorporating, the importance of a good business plan, and a ton of advice on how to keep your business alive during the beginning stages when money is tight.I found the book to be, well, boring in places - but the information held within was worth working through those parts."
3,common sense and fragments of lives,"At most times when I was reading this book, I thought ""that's just common sense, what are you telling me that's new and helpful?"" The authors recount the different lives and choices of 15 older couples in a fragmented series of annecdotes about what they look like, how they enjoy sex, who their friends are and all matters both important and trivial. The authors have a great subject to deal with but did not do the subject justice. Too many stories, and too little practical advice."
4,good for all couples,"this book serves up some eternal truths about relationships, and these factors are relevant for both young and older. i would guess that if you have not embraced these and followed most of them--you have moved on and are no longer together..."
1,Love Cornwell but Hate this Book,"I was so excited when I saw this new book by Cornwell...and then I started reading it. The story is long and boring and never seems to reach a climax. They move rocks, then move them some more, then there is a bit of a story about the brothers, their lovers, and their gods, then the rocks go a little farther. It seemed Cornwell was trying to address too many avenues in the story without focusing well on any one point. I still haven't been able to finish it unlike the Warlord Chronicles that I couldn't stop reading."
3,Brutal but Interesting,"I suppose anyone writing fiction has to just let some things go by, and not be too offputting. Suspend your disbelief, and all. But what bothered me more than anything in getting a feeling of believability is that the construction seemed to be the work of one man's mind, and him an outcast who would hardly be privy to the engineering and celestial knowledge necessary to pull off such a task. I mean, Stonehenge was probably the result of generations of accumulated knowledge passed down through a priestlike group of stoneage scholars. Not the way it is presented here. The other thing, as someone mentioned, is that every prediction made by the holy characters of the book comes true. Are we supposed to believe that they actually had magical powers in those days? This happened too many times to be a coincidence. Having said that, it was a pretty interesting story."
3,Stonehenge review,"This is of course a work of historical fiction, what facts could be used,were, other than that,it's mostly conjecture,however,that said,Bernard Cornwell is the absolute best at this so it was as good as it could get.The building of these kind of structures were along the same lines as work on the pyramids,all block and tackle and grunt labor,i.e. slave labor. The inner dynamics between the tribe leaders and their warriors were interesting but bloody and violent as one would expect from tribesmen of this time period. So not one of his best but still worth it for the theory alone."
3,Too long!,I thought the book was good but it went in great lengths and I felt that there was little character development.
3,More like 3 and 1/2,"This book tells the imaginary story of the creation of the famous british monument around 3000 B.C. It follows the lives of 3 brother, Saban, Lengar and Camabin. All three have various problems.Saban is a coward and both Camabin and Lengar(to varying degrees) are nuts. The story goes very well untill half way through the book. Then it seems to suffer from Steven King syndrom and rush the rest of the way through, so in the end what you get is a really lackluster book. However that does not take away from the good battles you can always count on Cornwell to give you."
2,Stonehenge,"Three brothers--a conqueror, a mad shaman and a regular guy turned builder--work both together and against each other to create the temple that we now call Stonehenge.Although I normally enjoy Cornwell's books, this one did not work for me. The primary reason was the shallow characterization. I never cared about the characters' fates or felt a sense of tension or excitement. They lack depth and none engaged my sympathies.The society Cornwell portrays seems somehow limp and tired to me, with little to make a reader sit up and take notice. There are some interesting bits, but overall I just couldn't find it engaging.A strength, and a place where Cornwell's research did show, was the depiction of the building of the temple itself; the backbreaking work as well as the artistry. The illustrations are invaluable. Having seen Stonehenge, I know it's astonishingly beautiful, and that does come through here."
2,"Unlike the Builders of Stonehenge, this Misses the Mark","I have never read anything by Bernard Cornwell, and eagerly picked this up hoping for another _Pillars of the Earth_ or _Sarum_. Unfortunately, this book echoes those only in the broadest sense. Like those books, this features human drama set against great erections in England. Unlike those books, this one did not seem well-researched or relevant. Cornwell, by setting this book in prehistory, has the luxury of creating his own mythology. This leaves him free to do as little research as possible while still writing what seems to hope to be a weighty tome. The one feature that is unchanging--the topography--is only referenced in the endnote acknowledgements. I do not profess to know anything about Stonehenge, and thus felt disappointed by being unable to place the oft-mentioned landmarks in any type of context. The story of the brothers is interesting at points and tiresome at others. All in all, I left this book disappointed."
4,"A great read, but not The Warlord Chronicles","Once again, Cornwell has brought a little-known, little-understood era of British history to life. He has imagined a world completely alien from ours, and describes it in haunting detail. The story is great, but occasionally bogs down in engineering details. It is a bit harder to follow than his other works, probably because it is so hard to imagine life in the Bronze Age, where gods and spirits were literally in the air, water, and all around. Life was cheap, and Cornwell makes 5th century Britain seem like Club Med compared to the Bronze Age. Historically accurate, great story, well-written."
1,Stonehenge,"I started this book with great anticipation as I like novels about the pre-historic era-and I like Mr. Cornwell's writing. However, I was extremely disappointed.It seemed very contrived to me, very long, very boring. I did finish it-I kept thinking it would get better. It didn't.I enjoyed the warlord series, the starbuck series and the sharpe series. All excellent. This one? Don't bother."
3,stonehenge,"This was not the best book Cornwell has written. It was still worth the read, but he usually does much better."
2,STONEHENGE,"A BIG CORNWELL FAN...IVE READ ALMOST ALL HIS BOOKS, INCLUDING LAST BURNING LAND....I SEARCHED HIS NOVELS..CAME UP WITH THIS UNREAD BOOK, WISH I MISSED IT...NOT MY CUP OF TEA..I HOPE HE GOT THIS MESS OUT OF HIS SYSTEM"
2,"Grim, depressng","I bought this book at Stonehenge on a recent visit. I found the book unrelentingly depressing...you come to care for characters who live out unheroic, hard, sad lives. I can accept that some of the historical details are a good reconstruction, but find that the narrative needn't have taken the turns it does to convey the information."
1,Repetitive...Pointless...Couldn't Finish,"I hate when a book gets so boring, stagnent and full of dead ends that I have to give up. This was one of those. I'm surprised that this author is so popular--was this just a bad egg or are the rest of his books like this? (As a guide: I've loved every Wilbur Smith and Ken Follett novel I've ever read.)"
2,This one is disappointing...,"This work certainly does not show Cornwell at his best. The plot is thick and slow, and the book is really boring. Stick with Sharpe, Starbuck, or even Redcoat for much better works than this one. Avoid."
4,Could of happened.,"Cornwell is a master story teller. His tale may be close to the truth. Religion seems to be at the root cause of so many mysteries and atrocities that his tale is credible. Good book to read, very entertaining."
2,Just really boring,"I really, really wanted to love this book. It's about the building of Stonehenge, and pagans in old England, so I thought it would be perfect for me. Unfortunately, it was one of the most boring books I ever read.There is just nothing interesting about this book. Lots of people are evil, lots of people age really fast, and nothing is described well. I don't even have that much to say about it. I just thought it was incredibly boring and a tad gross. And why are the gold bars always being described as lozanges?!!Two stars. I can't really recommend this to anyone."
2,You Can't Go Home Again,"This isn't a ""bad"" retrospective, but it's not the same as the original stuff. Maybe I wouldn't be so hard on this cd if I didn't also have some old ""real"" Ventures tapes with the original cuts. The Gold version of songs like Walk Don't Run and Apache are oddly ""off"" -- the reverb isn't right, the slides aren't right and the rhythm lines are too crisp. I'm not sure, but I think the guitars aren't tuned quite the same, either. The notes might be OK but the music isn't the same. Perfidia is pretty good but Telstar stinks -- it's too ""digital"". To me, part of the magic of the original was the mushy cymbals and guitar reverb, you know, early ""surround sound"" stuff. If you're into early surf guitar music, go with the Dick Dale ""King of the Surf Guitar"" cd and leave the golden oldie Ventures on the shelf..."
5,40 years of listening joy!,"I was 12 years old when I first heard that magical instrumental, ""Walk-Don't Run"", while riding in our '49 Buick. I was hooked, for 40 years!I can't quite believe my good fortune of having 40 years of listening pleasure. These guys have allowed me to grow with their everchanging, improving and innovating sound.This album is just what we would have heard during the 60's, using the latest technology.I recently purchased 2 live concert tapes of the late 90's. My first viewing ever of a group who's music has carried my through good times and less pleasant life experiences.Can we possibly see another 40 years?"
2,Not Original Stuff,"Nice remix collection but definitely lacks the punch of the original cuts. If you really need a cut of Tall Cool One you can make do with this CD, but if you are a real Ventures buff longing for that true and unique sound, you'll probably be disappointed."
2,INCCORECT,SOLD AS A BCA BEARING BUT I GOT A DIFFERENT BRAND FROM CHINA SHOULD GET THE BRAND THAT WAS LISTEDhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CF2218/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00
3,Di Angelo dances with Julio!,"Being the Julio Iglesias collector that I am, when I discovered this instrumental tribute to Julio, I had to have it, as instrumentals of Julio's music are not that common.The first time through I absolutely adored it. The music had life, vibrancy, color, and so danceable that during some of the songs I had to get up and dance. There was no sitting still on any of the tracks.Professionally, the drums could have been a bit quieter. They seem to fight for attention with the melodies. The sax could have been a bit smoother, and to really make this album shine would have been to include some of the latin percussion instruments to really make the flavor sparkle.All in all, it is a decent album, yet it could have been polished a bit. Would I recommend this album? Only to those who have a strong love for Julio Iglesias' music."
4,over 700 designs,"This book is divided into 5 categories: florals, paisleys, geometrics, conversationals (which includes fruits, veges, animals, landscape), and folk designs. I've enjoyed the folk design chapter as it inclues scandinavian, slavic, mexican, african, and oriental designs. There are 725 motifs in this book which are helpful in a huge variety of artistic endeavors"
4,"A good, basic dinnerware set","The Corelle Winter Frost White 16 piece set is a good basic dinnerware set. Durablility is the best feature of any Corelle pattern. The dinner plate and soup/cereal bowl are perfectly sized. The second plate in the set is a bread and butter plate, too small for salads but appropriate for desserts. The glasses that come with the set are not sturdy, but do look nice with the place setting. The all-white pattern makes it easy to accessorize--just change the linens and you have a totally new look."
5,excellent dinnerware,Nothing fancy but durable. Too bad it doesn't come in other colors than white. Very happy with the product though.
3,corelle dishes,"These dishes arrived with 2 glasses and one plate brocken, but at the price it was still worth it."
2,bad buy,"this is a bad buy. don't waste your money. the product came broken. amazon was great about replacing it. read through some good reviews and thought that i should try them. man, every time i'm washing the glass, if it slips, forget it. it's broken or crack. on the other hand, the dishes and bowls are not bad. thin, but good enough. so unless you don't mind buying other glasses to drink with, i wouldn't waste my money with this set."
5,Excellent product.....!,"It's just excellent...! I got another one and you'll be impressed 'cause the dishes are easy to wash and dry, and there're so ligth that you'll enjoy pick them."
3,My set had some flaws,"2 of the 4 dinner plates had weird bubbling on the side of them that didn't make them perfectly round. It looked very cheapy. 3 of the 4 glasses had defective bubbles in the glass. The small plates are too small to use for anything--I think the set should come with the 8 1/2 inch luncheon plates instead. Also, the bowls are really small. Corelle needs to make a larger bowl--like the pasta bowl, but deeper. All in all, I was marginally satisfied. I really like Corelle products, but felt like I ordered ""seconds"". I'm too lazy to pack up and ship back, so I guess the set is mine."
4,"Great price, very versitile",Corelle is so durable and light we've stopped using anything else. The plain white goes with almost any decor.
2,"Thoughtful, interesting, problematic","When seen as an expression of the author's faith, the book is thoughtful and interesting. Much of the book accurately represents the doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Other elements are the author's opinions, his position in the Church notwithstanding. In particular, his treatment of evolution is problematic. David O. McKay, the church president when the book was published, stated that ""the Church has officially taken no position"" on evolution. He said Smith's book ""is not approved by the Church"" and that the book is composed entirely of Smith's ""views for which he alone is responsible""."
3,Not As Simple as You'd Expect,"I found this book interesting and thoughtful, but the ancient philosophy and historical examination of the movement towards a simpler life seemed to be an exercise in ""Look how smart I am!"". The examination of the politics and economics behind the difficulty most families would experience in trying to cut back were very eye-opening and the end solutions about government invervention to try to enrich the life of American citizens more was interesting, but unlikely to occur. Overall, an interesting book, but if you're really interested in this topic I'd reccommend The Two-Income Trap, which is a more well-written discussion of the topic and more pertinent to an individual's need to consume less and make their life more simple."
2,oh its just the wife .,"Who would have belived it ,that this diminutive magician from ,the large toadstool in county mayo , could write such a stirring novel, of love, ambition, passion, magic and the american way . Apparently any one from 18 to tablet induced slumber,can perform magic tricks ,that will delight your hells angel neighbors for seconds . After only three days with this book, I was confident to perform magic at MADISON SQUARE GARDENS . I now own a large yacht ,have a very young wife , take regular holidays to the seychelles and am developing gout . I recommend you read this book . I did and hey ."
3,I had to modify it to work,the plug was a perfect match to my KIA Sportage wiring harness but the gizmo they have in line in it cut my volume to almost nothing. I was installing a new Sony to replace my broken factory unit and as is The volume had to be turned all the way up to hear it. I cut the thing off and wired it directly to the radio and everything sounds great now. I don't know what the thing was suposed to do but it didn't work.
2,Boring predictable,"Boring, predictable, Low budget, low light, bad quality, product placement - red bull? no good fight scenes just gun guns guns everywhere"
4,really really good crime drama with bad lighting...,"i've seen The Mission and Full time Killer and have generally been pleased with Johnnie To's work.the acting was great, the story/writing/characters were good, but lighting some of the action sequences (the shootout in the restaurant, followed almost immediately by the shootout in the doctor's office) were almost impossible to follow because of his choice of angles and lighting. now, i have a region 1 disc, so if there is a better version out there, get it.this was a really good movie that, in terms of acting, writing, and directing; is on par with anything that john Woo has done."
3,Johnny To riffs on The Wild Bunch in Macau,"Exiled isn't as good as Johnny To's previous effort, Election 2, although still stands head and shoulders among most recent action movies despite its flaws. The protracted opening sequence tends to feel a bit too much like posing until it really gets going and despite usually being at his best in To's films, unfortunately Simon Yam goes all Jack Nicholson this time out as the gang boss whose impatience causes all the problems. There are some nice moments of humanity, like the widow continually squeezing the trigger of a gun long after she's emptied it, but the riffing on The Wild Bunch starts to feel awfully self-conscious at times. Still, Red Bull must be pleased as punch to have the classiest bit of product placement in recent years, and ""There's no furniture"" may just be my favorite line of dialogue all year."
3,Anita Desai: One of the Most Infleuncial Authors of out Time,"Anita Desai is a very famous author from India. In her story, ""Games at Twilight,"" a peaceful game of hide & seek turns into an unforgettable nightmare for one boy."
5,gggggggggrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaattttttttt,one of the greatest horrors ever. it very underrated i suggest that every horror fan should go rent it
5,are you playing the game? or is it playing you?,"you have to ask yourself that when you see this comical, sick and twisted and powerful sci fi adventure/ horror moviethe ending is brilliantthe cast is amazindEdward Furlong could never let me down with the roles he doeshe was amazing in the Terminator 2 movie. he was amazing in Pet Semetary 2. he'll never let me downI have this on dvdsaw it when I was 14 with my dad for rent on vhsthe visuals and story haunted methat's how powerful this movie isit really lets you realize that sometimes the game you play is the real life thing and what you thought you didn't really do you really did ;)a lesson learned from this movie you will getI could watch this again and againtruly a great movie"
5,Enter a game the feels more real than reality!,"Excellent movie for any horror buff or fanatic. I highly recommend for teenagers and adults alike, In my personal opinion I think this is the best acting role of Edward Furlong yet! The movie has and cool plot and a great twist. But dont' take my word for it, see it for yourself."
2,Satisfactory,"This Movie is definetly not for the average movie goer. The plot basically revolves around game in which Furlongs character is playing. the game makes him think he is killing people. Furlong gives a decent performance, one of his finest. Langella gives yet another outstanding one, stealing every scene he is in. The character of the trickster, a mix of Axel Rose and Freddy Kruger, is about the gayest thing in a movie i've ever seen. The plot could have used some work no doubt, but every thing else is pretty good. Check it out if you like horror movies, you'll probably get a kick out of it"
1,DVD wouldn't play,"I had been looking for this movie for quite a while for my brother. I was really excited when I finally found it. The whole process went smoothly and the movie had arrived in about a week. Long story short, it didn't work. We tried to watch it with a couple different dvd players and television sets and it read disc error. Complete let down"
5,A good one when they don't make good ones no more,"Brainscan is a good Horror movie in a decade when they don't make good horror movies very often any more. Leonard Maltin, the critic fellow who wrote the above review saying that Trickster ""Is a transparent bid for Freddy Krueger like merchandise, but lacks appeal"" and that it is ""mediocre material"" had better have another job to fall back on if that's the kind of movie critiquing he does! Brainscan has many scares and surprises and a great Heavy Metal soundtrack, and can be ranked up there with ""Tales From the Crypt"" for good Horror."
3,only because it has sentimental value,"This is a movie I really do love but only because my best friend and I watched it about a billion times one summer in our glory days. It has super cheesy horror cliches, a terrible plot,and typical teenage-fight-the-authority dialogue.I didn't realize how bad it was back then.I do now, but it will always hold a special place in my heart."
3,Not a bad movie,Brainscan wasn't that bad of a movie. The movie talked about a teen played by Edward Furlong who gets this game in the mail called Brainscan. This leads to the apperance of Trickster. Eventually killings begin. The ending has a twist to it. Buy it today at amazon.com! Reccomended!
2,Dissapointed,"I am really dissapointed with this movie, i mean i thought the idea is cool, but just didnt play up to my expectations. Mostly because trickster was NOT SCARY!!! I thought he would be, scary and demented and forceful. Instead he breaks his fingers and sticks his fingers in his eyes, crap like that, that isnt scary, but rather funny and gross, you know when the audience goes ""eeeeeuuuuuwwwww"". Stupid. The background music was the worst part, its more low budget than Friday 13th, although i loooved Friday 13th, Jason rocks!!! But lets face it the music was a bit annoyingOk, look i kind of liked the atmosphere created, the lonely boy in his room, his high tech stuff, but in the end of the day its just not a horror movie"
1,GARBAGE,Please. For me. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. I just wasted an hour and a half of my life that could have been spent cleaning my navel. Maybe if you are under the age of fourteen you might enjoy the triteness of this waste of celluloid. I am definitely dumber now after watching this.
4,useful,"This is good book although I don't usually use it as my first source. The pictures are looking up at the underside of the wings which is great if you go hawk watching at migrattion time and there are lots of them but I use North American Raptors by Wheeler/Clark more because it has great pictures and hawks I usually see are either flying by or are sitting on a telephone wire/tree branch. Still, its a good reference and has info on migration that you don't get in other books. Its good as a supplement to other hawk books"
3,"An OK read, but only OK","David Weber is normally one of the best military sf writers going. Unfortunately, this isn't one of his better books.This novel was inspired by David Drake's excellent RANKS OF BRONZE. R.O.B. tells of a group of Roman legionaires captured in a war agains Persia, and sold as slaves to aliens who want to use them as mercenaries. I recommend it.E.A. concerns a group of English soldiers the aliens acquire centuries later. Weber appears to feel constrained by the necessity of conforming to Drake's background. And the book doesn't really end -- it justs stops, with more to come in the next book.I'll read anything by Weber, but this is one of his lesser works."
3,Entertaining but predictable,"Any fan of David Weber's work will be on familiar ground with this one. The story follows the same idea of ""local boy becomes Emperor"" that you will find in Weber's Mutineer's Moon series.Probably the biggest flaw in this book is the central character's uncanny savvy-ness. A medieval baron simply would not be able to cope with the situation in which Sir George and his wife find themselves in. It is all just too neat.But if you suspend that bit of disbelief, the story is fun to follow and an easy read, and Weber's superb grasp and ability to explain military situations is delivered once again.So go for it, but not with too high an expectation. A good way to spend a cross country flight."
1,A Major Disappointment,I am a big David Weber fan and was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately it is a severe disappointment. It is an expanded version of a short story. It should have stayed a short story. It is a disjointed puffed up overly long and frequently repetitious mess. I get the impression that Weber was going through the motions to meet a contract deadline. The author is capable of much better work which is why it is such a let down.If you are a David Weber fan save your money for his next book it has to be an improvement.
2,A futile effort,"While having never read the short story the book is based on, this book alone does not stand as a worthy addition to the rest of the authors works. Weber has written some fantastic stories, and mainly its been the characters of his books which have imprseed me. In this, the characterization of mideval persons miss the mark. Everything seems overly contrived to fit the plot, and the characters themselves are fairly flat. Its an interesting plot that has been re-worked by many authors (best accomplished in Ranks of Bronze by David Drake - in my opinion) but this seems to have been stretched from a short story with filler material to create this book. It's certainly not Weber's best effort, and in fact fact its his only one which i have not liked so far. It lacks the characteristic clash of personalities that seems to permeate a lot of his work."
1,Totally ignored the other books in this series,"Not only did David Weber's ""sequel"" to Carthago Delenda Est ignore everything ever stated in Foreign Legions (Besides St. George and the Dragon), he totally threw out the good cheer of humanity at the end of Carthago, and puts them in the position of being ruined and destroyed.This, in my mind ruined this book. Instead of carrying David Drake's stellar work forward, he basically stated ""David was wrong, humanity was screwed, but my guys can fix it.""I'm sorry Mr. Weber, but without real details of how exactly we went from secret alliances, pirate destruction, and a crusade to free the enslaved from the Doge to mankind's final hour, this book receives a 1."
1,Almost a copy,"I picked out this book becuase it sounded similar to another book I had read called Ranks of Bronze. Although I am only to the first battle, I feel like I am reading Ranks of Bronze again. The only difference is Ranks of Bronze was much more discriptive and used a Roman Legion instead of English Knights and Longbowmen. Everything in this book is just like ranks of bronze. The guild the english work for, the toad faced guards, the ""commander"", the post battle recovery. My reccomendation....Read Ranks of Bronze it is a much better book."
3,Demon Jester without the jests,"A well-told story of a fairly standard theme - the humans kidnapped and forced to survive in an alien and technologically threatening universe. In this example of the genre Weber (who always does put together a good yarn) presents the desperation very effectively, but the humans are just TOO adaptable and the aliens are just TOO cardboard cutout. A pleasant airplane read but not up to Weber's usual standard."
4,Surprise Sequel,"I picked up this book because I like most of Weber's books. To my surprise, it was a sequel of sorts to ""Ranks of Bronze"" by David Drake, one of my all time favorites. You could read either one of them first, or not at all, but I would suggest reading ""Bronze"" first."
3,The High Crusade was better,"At the outset, I must state that I bought the book tobe entertained. Weber is a good author. This is not ""TheHigh Crusade"" by Poul Anderson. This is not as good a bookas it could be. There is a ALOT more work to be donehere. The goal of the book was to free the English andfight the aliens. The book is just too short. The aliensfall, the English run off, the Romans from ""Ranks of Bronze""return to Earth, the aliens decide to erase Earth, andEnglish arrive to save the day. All this is three chaptersor so. I wanted to scream at Weber, ""Look, dude, you needto show your work. As it is, you say, in essence, *I hadthis problem. I worked on it a bit. Then a miracle occuredand I got the solution I wanted.* I want that box labeled*A Miracle* expanded a QUITE a bot more."""
2,"OK if you find it used, and have time to waste","Yet another one of David Weber's very predictable, quickie books to make a buck. As so many others have pointed out, the entire concept has been done much better: Anderson's ""High Crusade,"" Pournelle's ""Janissaries"" and Barbet's ""Napoleons of Eridanu.The real weakness of the book is Weber's predictability and falling back on tried-and-true themes worked out in the Honor Harrington series. Telepathic aliens that hold the solution, evil but stupid villains oh so easily outsmarted by our endlessly virtuous hero, and the ""contralto"" voice which is obligatory for all Weber heroines.However, it is a ripping-enough yarn for a not too discriminating reader who, like myself, bought it used. IF you have already read Anderson, Barbet or Pournelle, try Weber. Otherwise, get one of them."
2,Save YOur Money,"I always consider it a warning sign when the reviews on a volumes cover all refer to other works by the author. Such is the case with the Excalibur Alternative. Although David Weber has written many notable volumes, this is a piece of schlock that is best avoided. Weber describes in his forward how this book began life as a short story, and it would have been better if it had stayed one. The middle 60% of the novel is nothing but filler, where the main character endlessly lectures on things to convey little additional information. Unless you need something to read on an airline flight and then throw away, look for one of Weber's other works instead."
4,A great read,Ford is a lovely writer. I loved Independence Day and this book whilst not as good is still A great read.
4,A GUILTY PLEASURE,"Tons of glitzy novels about the rich and the infamous have been published throughout the years. Some were good, some were very very bad. PLACES places itself in the former category. Clean prose, colorful characterization, an effective uncomplicated plot all add up to one cool guilty pleasure that will surely make you turn its pages very quickly. Enjoy.-----Martin Boucher"
3,Skacore at its best,"This CD is a very kickass, and hard to find item. If u cant find it go to pricegrabber.com cuz thats were i got mine at. in my opinion this cd is better then squattas paradise and no gods / no managers bcuz its not over produced (maybe not produced at all). i couldnt find this cd on tent city's web site or anything. you damn well better buy this cd cuz its better then leftover crack or any other CV cd's. to bad they broke up tho."
1,USELESS,these nylon snaps are completely useless. They are better in the trash quite honestly.manufacturer should discontinue making these. a waste of material.
3,Works well... but looks like hell,"These cymbals work ok... have good response, BUT, they are cheap as can be, and look it. One was warped a good TWO INCHES... it looks like a pringles potato chip. There is no way to prevent them from rotating while playing.. so that's a pain.I use them on my ION Rock Band kit for Xbox 360... which requires some hub thingies and felt pads to be purchased as well.I wish they were better quality... but they do play fine"
5,on time and a great read,This book was highly enjoyed by my mom. It was one of her Christmas gifts. I really am happy that I ordered it. This is one of our favorite authors.
5,Once again always worth waiting for.,Nora Roberts leaves me with that coming home feeling with these novels.She has a way of making her readers relate to the characters as though they could be any one of us.
3,Not one of her better efforts ...,"A surprising number of Nora Roberts' stories and series are well-researched and well-crafted, e.g. the Bride quartet. For me, First Impressions is forgettable. I guess you can't churn out this many books a year and have every one be a winner!"
3,FUN non-traditional heroine,"I like the Shane gal with cuteness and imperfection, as she meets the volatile carpenter/CEO. Nice storyline and bit of historical background that Nora Roberts never fails to add."
3,First Impressions review,Entertaining and happy. I enjoy taking a break from more serious books to the light entertainment of a Nora Roberts. Novel.
4,Pleasant Romance,"I enjoyed the rural Maryland setting and the attitude of the heroine, Shane. She left teaching to try developing an antique business in the house inherited from her grandmother. It's love-at-first-sight for her when she sees the supposedly unemployed, new neighbor who's rehabbing his house. He's cranky and stand-offish after marriage to a horrible gold-digger, so Shane gets on with fixing up her own house. At every meeting, she erodes his resistance with her sunny nature and down-home charms.A pleasant enough romance with nice descriptions of the area and characters."
4,First Impressions,"Excellent story in the Nora Roberts style. Both protagonists seeking to escape busy, non-rewarding lives meet and immediately perceive the other as unwilling to show their true personalities due to some hidden agenda.After several mishaps, and interference by outside sources, the road to romance is again straight and narrow. A good read."
4,"Great story, predictable ending","As with most romance novels and chick flicks, the ending is the predictable feel-good kind. However, the story is heart warming, and written as only Nora Roberts can express such things. If you like the genre, this is a must-read."
1,Not a good one for me,"This was probably one of the most boring books Ms. Roberts has written. Normally I enjoy her books (LOVED ""The Gift"") However, I found this to be to drawn out, predictable, and not exciting to say the least. The most exciting part was when the mother came to town and even that was not all that exciting. Took me too long to get through and will not be a reread for me."
2,First Impressions,I think the cover is the best thing about this book. It is not what I was hoping for. Not enough intrigue. Just this girl moves home and meets the guy next door who keeps grabbing her and kissing her when there is supposed to be unspoken anger between them. yadda yadda yadda
2,an older book.,"this book is a simple, short love story. there isnt much depth to it but i did enjoy it. one has to remember that this is one of the earlier books writen by nora. you can see the major improvment in her writing skills as well as character depth. it is a quick read and one that leaves a smile on your face. sometimes thats enough ::smile"
4,First Impressions,I found this nook to be very interestingMy interest and suspense was held right to the end. I have read almost all the books Nora Roberts has written. I always find them a pleasureable experience.
4,Good Read,I didnt know really what to expect with this .. I am so glad I picked it up. Much more adult than her other stuff and really entertaining. Buying the rest of her books!
5,Great read,"A really good book to read on a snowy January day. I love both main characters, Shane and Vance. Shane is such a wonderful woman, warm friendly and loving, just what Vance needs in his life. Very enjoyable love story."
2,Too much too soon,"Love happens by page 3 in this book. Well, not really, but alittle more realism would have made this book believable. Maybe."
5,Nice book.,"I really like this book. Both stories were so romantic and nice. I must say that I don't care if this was ""vintage"" Nora. I loved it anyway."
2,Not impressed,A present from a friend who was aware of my interest in Mexican literature. The book is saved by the writers interviewed by Gazarian Gautier. She herself is not really much of an interview and misses the obvious follow-up questions.
3,"Doesn't match up to ""The Genesis Code""","After devouring ""The Genesis Code"" in one sitting, I was delighted to find a second novel by anonymous author John Case. Unfortunately, instead of not being able to put the book down, I had to force myself to pick it up. It starts out interestingly enough but the plot bogs down with same-old, same-old stuff about cults taking over the world. Wait for the paperback!"
2,This book was not nearly as fun and intersting as Genesis Co,"I thought this book was a big let down after reading his first book. It started out with an interesting premise, but degenerated quickly into a cliche. I don't read many books where I cringe after reading a passage (which is often the case with suspense movies). Often times I wondered why entire chapters were included at all. Perhaps to extend this already short book. Although I was disappointed, the book was entertaining enough to warrant reading."
5,A suspenseful thriller you will not want to put down!,"John Case has written another exciting novel. Centered around the threat of an outbreak of a deadly strain of the flu virus, Case delivers and intricate and meticulously detailed plot. With several twists and turns along the way, you will not want to put this book down."
2,Hasty ending,"Sure the book was interesting and even exciting at first, but when the plot starts to unfold, it seems that the author lost interest in writing and decided to end the book quickly. The book leaves you with a cheated feeling after finishing. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except to readers especially interested in the ""global destruction - good guy versus bad guy"" kind of books."
2,KEEPS YOU GOING(somewhat) THEN NOTHING IN THE END!!!,While reading this book I found myself just reading to finish it. There are some suspencefull moments but in the end it leaves you wondering why you even finished the book!!! Case was great in the Genesis Code but lacks alot of his talent in this Novel.
2,Weak writing makes for dull reading,"This books tries to hard to scare, doesn't try hard enough to involve. Mr Case may have an impressive resume, but he doesn't write well enough for readers who require to be persuaded that what they have in front of them is more than a collection of overblown nonsense."
3,Reasonably plausible twist to an overused storyline,"Biological thrillers are becoming so prevalent that they are losing their appeal. For some reason, television and the movies haven't caught up yet, but watch out when they do--we'll all get ""sick"" of them in a hurry! This plot actually seemed plausible for the most part (until the invasion of the compound and subsequent sewer chase). Characters were introduced in small bits and only the important ones carried on, which made this a fun, easy to follow book. ""Case"" does need to tone down the emphasis on individual words. Almost every page has at least one, and usually several, italicized words to show emphasis. It's as if he doesn't think we can get into the book enough to imagine the voice inflections the characters would have used. I found this incredibly distracting and unnecessary. Other than that, it's a decent book that can provide some entertainment and even makes one wonder a little."
2,Ho-Hum,"Maybe is was because I had just finished Tom Clancy's similarly-themed ""Rainbow Six"", but I found Case's second novel to be completely routine, far inferior to his fine first effort, ""The Genesis Code"". So wanting in character development and exposition, it reads like a B-thriller's screenplay. Despite its short length, red herrings abound.If you are a fan of the genre, you might find this novel passable; others beware. At least you should be able to knock it off in just a couple of days and move on to something else a little more satisifying.A disappointing effort from the author of ""The Genesis Code""."
2,"weak plot, weak characters, weak writing","The characters in this book are one-dimensional and laughable. The events which bring them together are contrived and improbable. The writing jumps from event to event, with little or no glue to tie things together. In short, it's as though John Case had a few pieces of an idea, then tried to throw together a book. Even _The Genesis Code_ was better, which is difficult to say since it, too, suffered from a lot of the same shortcomings."
2,Just a little off...,"While this wasn't a terrible book, it wasn't a great one either. The facts that Chase uses are intruiging, but I think that the Fed's would be all over a cult after learning what this reporter had uncovered. Biological weapons are certainly a threat, and I would hope the Government would be quicker to respond to such a threat than what was portrayed in this book.As for accuracy, just what kind of paint did they use in such a hostile environment as the arctic? And PCR, is not correctly defined in the book either. I know it's a little picky to find such flaws, but if the author is going to try to wow us with his scientific knowledge, he ought to get his facts straight."
2,STRANGELY CLUELESS CHARACTERS,"Is it only me, or has anyone wondered how Frank and Annie seemed to be so unconcerned, hell, CLUELESS, about the danger they were in?Despite an escalating avalanche of evidence on just how dangerous those whackos from the Temple of Light were... they, weirdly, went around as if nothing and nobody was going to hurt them.Add that to the fact that they continually do stupid and moronic things, the characters of Frank and Annie begin to border on the preposterous.The evidence before them should have made them paranoid about their safety. They weren't.That borders on the preposterous.Hence my conclusion.Frank and Annie are CLUELESS.They amount to characters who are so centered on their selves and their petty concerns, that they don't deserve the honorific of having saved the world."
1,Not worth the time,"A great premise that turned into a boring story. Everything seemed to just move along too conveniently and many things were just too far fetched. The dialog was lame and many times pointless, the characters were mostly window dressings and the story left out any feelings of suspense. To top it off, the ending leaves you staring at the back cover wondering why you wasted your time. Leave The First Horseman on the store shelf and pick up the Genesis Code instead."
3,Good book until the end,"The reason this book avoided receiving two stars instead of three is because the middle, meaty part of the book is very good.The First Horseman starts off kind of slowly, and it takes a little while and alot of effort to get into the groove. It does pick up, however, and is good until the very end. I cannot tell you how it ends, but I will say that it is little more than a let down."
2,"C'mon John, you can do better than this!","After reading Case's first novel, The Genesis Code, I eagerly anticipated his next offering, The First Horseman. Unfortunately, I trusted Case would once again weave together a thought provoking plot with dynamic characters in his next novel. Although Case falters in his pure storytelling ability, in The Genesis Code, Case compensated with an excellent plot and spectacular action.Nothing could compensate for the attrocious plot development and static characters of The First Horseman. The conclusion was predictable half way through the story. Dramatic irony does not explain Frank Daly's foolhardy behavior. He was more irritating than Jar-Jar Binks in Star Wars, and Daly was the main character! Case really disappointed me with this novel, I truly hope he has an excuse. Maybe next time he should create the plot and have someone else do the writing."
1,"Who is ""John"" Case?","In response to several other reviewers' interest in the _real_ John Case, my feeling while reading this book was that the author most likely lacks the Y chromosome that is common to most Johns. The gender-discrete ""author profile"" at the end of the book made this even more likely."
3,Flawed but Interesting,"First Horseman is a fast read with an interesting plot line, but the story is flawed by the occasional irrational action by the main character. Luckily the author is able to keep the story going with enough twists that he almost makes up for the stupidity of his lead. If you want a light read on the timely topic of bacterial/germ warfare, this is not a bad start."
4,Good Thriller,"Though not nearly as good as Case's The Genesis Code, the book is still engaging and has a lot of interesting scientific information that is simple enough for the layman to understand yet detailed enough to grab the attention of a scientist. It's somewhat slow moving at times, and becomes kind of obvious towards the end, but Case manages to maintain our interest with his very good story telling, allowing the bits and pieces into place as the story progresses. And it has neat ending."
3,Creapy Realism,"Looking for a truly frightening ride? This book is just as scary as the Haunted Mansion, but with the effort of a merry-go-round. Case's book, ""The First Horseman"" is a bioterrorism thriller. The best part of this book-- making the whole ordeal worth reading-- is it's conclusion. Although the ending was not as surprising as his ""The Genisis Code"", Case ties the fictional events of his story so well to reality, I found myself surfing the internet for evidence to prove his story was just a story. This book is an easy read and isn't very complicated, but it's interesting and exciting. You're left feeling insecure about your existence on this planet and insecure about the power of the government."
4,Good book!,"This book is excellent. I couldn't stop reading it. The entire plot seems split so far apart that it wouldn't ever make sense, and when it does, you're on the edge of your seat reading until you finish it!I also recommend The Genesis Code!"
1,Boring,"I am a lover of thrillers, but The First Horseman had no thrills. The first third of the book was somewhat enjoyable, and after that it became one of the most dull books I have ever read. If you are trapped on the airplane with this book, be sure to watch the movie, even if Stepmom is showing!"
4,Be afraid....be very afraid.....,"I loved 'the genesis code,' and looked forward to this new offering from the mysterious john case.I guess what struck me about this book is that its premise is so possible. It frightens me to think what is going to happen to this planet when fanatics like case's villan...and the like perfect biological warfare. There will be no safe place...not even the woods of east Texas!case has done a good job telling a story with tragic consequences for all of us.I look forward to more case! I just wish he had a kinder, gentler planet to write about."
5,A fantastic high-tech thriller,"This is a very well-written thriller that combines an excellent plot, very good writing, an a high-tech scientific angle that is very reminiscent of Michael Crichton. I was extremely impressed by this book and highly recommend it. Case is a winner."
3,Nothing new but it's still enjoyable,The author executed a fairly standard thriller well. Not a bad read for a long plane flight.
2,intesting premise but...,"I read the Gensis Code and while I had an easy time figuring it out, I belived it. This book however I did not belive. It seems like the major reason Case picks the disease he picks in this book is because no one else has used it. He even states at one point that it would be eaiser for the villians in this book to use a virus like Ebola, so why don't they.I gave the book two stars because I think he makes intersting use of apocolypitic legend. Also some of his charcters aren't bad but they pale by comparision to the ones he created in The Gensis Code."
3,"Definatly not as good as ""The Genesis Code""",I was rather dissappointed in this book. This novel was just a little too confusing for me. There were topics that were addressed and then later dismissed as if the reader were to have already known what went on. The prologue was a definate attention grabber but the book seemed to go down hill from there. I have to admit that there were some crucial high points that did keep me reading but all in all I found it to be a big let down.
3,"Great premise, great development, fails at the end","I looked forward to this book after reading the Genesis Code. I loved the book's premise and the historical information it provided. The characters initially reacted intelligently to their respective situations, but the book fell apart at the end with intelligent people doing incredibly stupid things. The book is worth reading for the 90% that I thought was quite exciting and good, but it went from an excellent thriller to a silly adventure story."
3,Promising start goes awry - conclusion spins out of control,"Mr. Case grabs you at the beginning with the prologue and wins your rapt attention. However, as the story proceeds, more and more bizarre and illogical events start to corrupt the believability of the whole story. Frank Daly, the hero of the book, begins to make decisions and jump into actions that don't jive with his character as a smart, savvy individual and this really detracts from the ending. As I got toward the end of the book, I realized that Case was gonna have to wrap up his little tale with a flurry of action because there were several loose ends and not many pages left. Unfortunately, the conclusion was sadly predictable and maybe Case realized that, which is why he seems to speed through it, giving only perfunctory gestures towards original storytelling. I think that the last couple of chapters could have been replaced by a footnote saying, ""See Die Hard""."
5,WHO IS JOHN CASE?,"Whoever he may be, he ranks with Michel Creighton and Robin Cook. His mixture of fact with fiction gives his story both suspense and credibility. There really was an expedition to Norway to hunt for the virus. The 1918 flu was pandemic. My 90 year old grandmother lived through it and to her flu equals death. She would no sooner take a flu vaccine then I would an AIDS vaccine. Anyone who has worried about biological terroism should read this book. Lets just hope Saddam Hussain doesn't get hold of the copy. As for those who compain about this not being a ""thriller"" they must be addicted to gun battles and car chases. This is a psychological thriller based on the very real capabilities of anthrax brewing terrorists. If you want blood, gore and ridiculous story lines go back to Dean Koontz."
4,If you're going to choose mainstream,If you're going to skip the classics and look for a mainstream type of book you might as well look for something by John case. I find his books to be a step above your everyday Grisham and James Patterson novels. This book touches on a very real and dangerous topic in today's world. Biochemical warfare is not talked about much by the government because the results of which would be devastating. Overall with all the books i've ever read I would probably drop this rating to a three.... but I choose to rate books based on the type of books they are; this would make a good tavel type of book.
5,Strong and easy to use,I like this brand of tape because it really is easy to start getting it to come off the roll every time. I've gone through lots of brands and wasted lots of time with tape that's hard to get started or shreds when you try to pick up a free end. This is my favorite brand and it's not more expensive than the others.
5,"GOOD, STURDY TAPE","QUALITY TAPE THAT DOES SEPARATE EASILY FROM THE ROLL WHEN YOU PULL IT. CUTS EASILY AND STICKS TO PACKAGE WELL. THE TAPE IS PERFECT FOR MANY USES. AND AT THIS PRICE, I WILL BE PURCHASING IT AGAIN, ESP AROUND CHRISTMAS WHEN I MAIL MY FAMILY'S AND FRIENDS' PACKAGES FROM CA TO MISSOURI."
2,I didnt like this tape,"I wasnt that into this tape. I used it for its intended purpose. But i noticed it doesnt stick that well. Sure its ""ez"" start but i just would have rather had something else. Im trying another packing tape by duck brand & we will see how that does"
2,"""the maker of rules dealing w/ fools I can cheat you blind""","One of the most frustrating things about being a APP fan is the lack of non-album B-Sides and rare tracks to be found. Outside the studio and live albums, all you can find are compilations of stuff fans have heard many times before like 'Love Songs' and 'Instrumental Works.' Case in point, 'Eye in the Sky,' which uses the title of one of the APP's most popular albums and adds the very misleading ""Extra Tracks."" If this was in fact just a compilation with actual ""extra tracks"" that I haven't heard I would buy it in a heartbeat, but all these songs are available on various APP studio albums including ""Standing on Higher Ground"" off the 1987 LP 'Gaudi' (five years after 'Eye in the Sky'). I was going to give it three stars because it is reasonably priced (it should be, considering the tacky cover photo) but then it dawned on me that there is not a single track from my all-time favorite APP album Ammonia Avenue represented on this compilation."
5,miracle live VCD,"I have to admit i had never heard of this band until recently,and i was astonished, this band of instrumentalists are FANTASTIC to watch perform,and of course there can be no doubting their musical talents,i guess you could say there music is a kind of cross between that of bond and perhaps a hint there of kitaro style too,if you like either of these artists it a good probability you will enjoy listening to the 12 girls band too,they play acoustic chinese instruments,string,woodwind and even some percussion on one track,they are accompanied by a western style backing band"
5,Fun toy that sits on my office desk,"Few visitors to the office can resist winding it up and watch it jitter across the tabletop. These are really fun little mechanical beasts, much appreciated by engineers and children alike."
3,It walks,This was a toy bought for our grandson. It is unstable and tends to fall over. It is not used as it doesn't work well. Will be selling it at yard sale
2,Works if you are within 2 feet away.,Really nice and warm but you have to sit right on top of it. Would not recommend. Noth worth the money.
1,Lilo & Stitch PC video game,"Really hoped that this would be a fun game for my 6YO son but, alas, I couldn't get it to load and run on my PC. Tried all of the tricks that I found on-line from similar frustrated purchasers but ultimately could not get it to run. My son was (and still is) disappointed."
5,Into Love and Out Again,I didn't realize they were all short stories and most of them downers.I love the author and will keep on reading her.
4,Eldercare for Dummies,Found this to be a helpful book that covered some issues that I am dealing with with two elder members of our family. To the point and up to date! Useful in giving approaches to conversations with our elderly parents.Rustycat2
3,"Cute, but small","This doll is adorable, but it is so tiny. I really don't think it is worth the price ($22.00 plus [...] shipping). I really thought it was going to be bigger, which would be great for the price. I can't be too upset though, because it is one of the cutest things I have ever seen. Unfortunately though, my daughter really isn't into it that much. If I could do it all over again, I don't think I would have purchased such a small doll for that price."
5,Mom of 2,"My 18 mo old loves this doll. She has taken it around everywhere and luckily it's machine washable because she's done so much with it I've needed to put it through the wash. She has other dolls she likes, but this one goes everywhere with her. Because of the success of this toy with her we just bought the KK Guggolli doll for her and the teething ring version for her baby sister for Christmas. She's one spoiled little girl - Only downside is that the doll in and of itself isn't educational, but a parent can make any toy a learning experience. - She's emulated mom with her doll more than once."
2,Cute but small,"This doll is cute as a button, but worth the money? Doubtful. It is about the size of a (5 dollar) beanie baby. I love the Waldorf dolls, but why do they have to be SO expensive. If the doll was twice the size or half the price, it would be worth it."
5,Loves It.....,"My daughter just got this doll for her first birthday. She really isn't into many stuffed animals or toys, but she does love this doll. It is worth it weight in gold watching her carry it around while she does her waddle walk. It is a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be though. I wouldn't recommend for children over one. It is just to small. It is maybe four to six inches tall."
3,Not as advertised,"This is obviously not a big deal, but I do find it to be annoying that they show the old picture of this product, when that is not what you're getting. They don't make this version anymore. I was buying it because I thought I had finally found the exact replica of the one my daughter had lost. The one I received was larger and has a totally different hat. My daughter was fine with it, but that's not cool. I'm just asking for truth in advertising. No problem with the item itself, just with Amazon giving a false indication of what you're getting."
5,"Haven't read it yet, but look forward to it!",Just had to put my two cents in. I had Karen's class on Society and Culture during the Industrial Revolution about 5 years ago and it was THE most fascinating class I have ever had. Ideas I learned in that class still come up even in random small talk. Makes me regret I majored in literature. I look forward to getting my hands on this book! Thanks Karen for being such a great instructor!
4,BE CAREFUL,"REVISION!!!! I have received the camera and it is very nice. Do NOT believe the advertising - it DOES include a 16mB memory card and it only needs 2 AA batteries, NOT 4! It is a nice camera and well worth the new price!"
2,Grainy results,"Bought this for my son. Most common functions were intuitive but we still needed to read the manual a lot. However, the pics were very grainy. My old 2MP Fuji Finepix had better resolution. We returned the Vivitar for a Samsung Digimax 360 (3.2 MP) which we like much better."
4,Vivi Cam 3825,I have just bought this camera for my daughter at a Super Walmart on sale for $160.00. Brand new & still wrapped in box.Have yet to try it but it makes me feel better that I saved almost $90.00. Will let you know how it works.Alicia
5,What a Revelation!,One of the best books about sharing the gospel. This book will put a fire under you and help you realize what it is that we need to do as believers.The opening chapter engages you right away. You think that this is a fictional story in the beginning but he uses fictional circumstances as examples to get the idea through of the importance of sharing the gospel.An amazing writer with a gift for apologetics!
5,...and let the Truth be known...,"I don't think any reader's review will do this great book any justice. I am 56, and remember a lot of my late Mother's ""beauty"" secrets. Confused as I was, I had no choice other than to let her do whatever she said was necessary. In this book, you will find that home remedies do work. My own experience: Lemon Juice rinse once a month did keep me Blonde all these years(no gray hair & no Miss Clairol necessary*) I doubt that you'll read one page without asking, 'now why didn't I think of that?'. Can't give it enough praise. Give yourself a treat, just Buy it."
1,WARNING,"Ms. Irons fails to mention that the Mayonnaise facial (on page 14) burns like crazy. I used a regular jar of mayo, left it on for 10 excrutiating minutes and not for 20 as was recommended. My cheeks/nose were red and sore (my skin is not oily nor is it sensitive), just like a sun burn. I wouldn't recommend this mask for more than 5 minutes. I haven't tried the other masks for fear of more pain and misery."
3,Light as a meringue,"""The World's Best-Kept Beauty Secrets"" is fun, frothy reading, but based on the excerpts, it doesn't bring much that's new to the table. The author's warm, chatty tone urging women to make time for theselves, keep journals, stand up straight and project poise do not reveal anything deeper than common sense. How often have you heard these same exhortations from your mother, your friends and every advice columnist out there?Still, it's not a bad way to spend time in a waiting room, and if you like the subject of beauty, it beats reading an out-of-date fashion magazine."
5,Worlds best kept beauty secrets,I'm am really glad that I bought this book. If you are interested in learning about beauty tips and want to learn some basics then I highly recomment it. Nothing to loose but skin problems if you follow the tips in this book. I would stay away from the mayonaise suggestion however because it burns somewhat. This book is a must read. You will learn lots of things from making your own facial mask from natural ingredients from your kitchen and how to take care of your body inside and out.
3,"Cheap, only 1"" long, but cool detail","My son likes it. They are tiny, but he thinks they are cool. They have more detail than other cheap plastic tanks. They are somewhat durable, except for the fragile barrel. I wouldn't spend much on this, but for a few bucks its worth it. Note the size is only about one inch. Made of plastic, not die-cast."
1,?,"I did not receive the item that I ordered. PC Universe knformed me that they did not stock subject UDB hub. They sent me a substitute unit that was satisfactory. I sent several e-mails to Amazon which went unanswered. Eventually got a refund after several phone calls to PC Universe. Could not get in contact with Amazon at all. The whole thing has been a nightmare. Probably will not order again from Amazon, the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing, etc, etc....ESJ"
1,"It Usually Works, But Not Often Enough","I do not trust my Cables Unlimited 4-PORT USB 2.0 Mini Hub.The idea of the device is great: Plug four USB devices into one unit, then connect it into your computer via one line. It is simple to use.Just because an idea is good, and its use is simple does not mean it works. I have only my mouse and my printer plugged in the hub, and occasionally, one will become disconnected even while still plugged in. Likewise, my SanDisk USB thumb drive (which I love), would disconnect. With a mouse disconnecting, it is a hassle. With a thumb drive, with files being used live, it is intolerable. I no longer use my thumb drive with the Hub.I do not recommend the Cables Unlimited 4-PORT USB 2.0 Mini Hub.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"
2,Disappointing,"I was frankly disappointed in this book. I felt it may have tried too hard to be ""novel""ish as opposed to research-oriented or academic, and it sounded contrived sometimes in the process. I, too, thought the author was too enthralled with the slut stories and didn't delve deep enough into the possible link between the ""slut"" archetype and past sexual abuse. I also wanted to delve deeper into exactly what the ""slut"" stereotype says about our 21st century view on women's sexuality.I discussed this topic with several men, and it's clear: Women are viewed as sluts whenever they sleep with several men, or even have any sort of love/sex relationship with several men over the course of years. But when men do the same with women, no stereotype, no archetype ensues. Why is this? I was hoping this book would explore this, but it didn't. Disappointing."
3,Define yourself instead of letting others define you,"Since I didn't go to school in suburbia I didn't see this in high school but there would was girls in the neighborhood that were talked about this way. It seems sad that a young woman who is outgoing and prematurely has a woman's body gets treated so badly. Then again, in high school lots of people get stuck with labels. You either have to get over it or live the life others try to give you.I think if woman who were stuck with this cruel label read this book, they would see they are not alone and that could help them get over their undeserved reputation."
2,FAST GIRLS: TEENAGE TRIVES AND THE MYTH OF THE SLUT,"I was disappointed in this book because the author struggles to present a coherent point of view. She veers from personal story to personal story without leading the reader to any original insight about why girls treat one another this way and what societal pressures encourage such harsh judgements in adolescent girls. Also, there is very little material about the way in which the desire to condemn and isolate may have changed in recent years due to a society in which sexuality is increasingly open and diverse."
5,Hotter than . . . well . . . just think of somethin' hot!,"Attention Rockabilly Fans:Mack Stevens has something for you here. This ""Texas Heat"" CD is a good one. I'm liking the way Mack gets all crazy with his wacked out sense of humor. But mostly I just like the way he hugs on tight to the traditional rockabilly sound -- stinging lead guitar solos, slap bass, banging drum . . . and most of all . . . that big Texas voice of Mack Stevens. It's a voice that can hiccup and wail, and it's a voice that can croon."
5,A Real Gem of a Book,"Bob Buck started flying as a young man in the 1920s and soon became well known due to some record making flights, including breaking the junior transcontinental record and for a time was the youngest licensed pilot in the United States. At the age of 30 he joined TWA, became chief pilot in 1945 and flew until the mandatory retirement age of 60 in 1974. During that time he flew special missions for the Air Force, became friends with politicians and actors (there's a marvelous photo of him and Bob Hope on a movie set) and was a personal favorite of Howard Hughes. He started with TWA on DC-2s and ended up piloting the first 747 for them. It's a well written, easy to read story. Recommended for not only aviation enthusiasts but also for the general reader."
3,Better pilot than writer,"No doubt Bob Buck had one of the more interesting flying lives: beginning in the 1920s and '30s, through WWII, and on to modern jets. But something about his writing style leaves me wanting more and never getting it. It's not just his occasional grammatical errors (mixing tenses, for instance); I fault his editor for those annoyances. Rather, it's his inability to fully convey the emotions of the dramatic moments he experienced. He describes events in somewhat detached tones and pale colors, concentrating more on facts and a textbook-like history, never really revealing his deeper thoughts about anything. Maybe he never had any? Being introspective myself, I prefer the Ernest K. Gann or Len Morgan or Gordon Baxter style. If you have all of their collections and want still more flying stories, then get this book."
2,,"I am not sure this is the one I am thinking of, but if it is, most of it was made up from whole cloth. I adore cats. I have had quite a few of them and cannot get enough of watching their antics. I know that they are very involved with us and stick close by when we are ill. Some form wonderful bonds with each other, I have seen that. Some are capable of warning us when there is danger. But these stories are wildly unbelievable. Hope the author made a lot of money from this book."
1,cat lovers,"I gave this book as a gift to a woman who is very connected to her cat.I asked her about the book, and she stated that she prefers more entertaining tales of cats, and that some of the stories, although miraculous, seemed depressing to her.I never read it."
3,For Kids,This was a gift for some kids for Christmas. I think it's a good gift - and the kids enjoyed it.
5,One Great little Book,"In a world where all around is apparent madness, this is a perfect book to read from just before going to sleep. It iswell written, with a quick easy style that is typical of Hanson and Steiger. The stories are both interesting anduplifting, with nothing that will bring about any uneasy dreams. Only buy this book if you enjoy reading in bed, thecompany of cats or getting a great nights sleep."
4,wonderful cats,"I am a cat lover and they are always a big part of my life and my family. My cats are indoor cats and I think very intuitive, seemingly they know what I am doing and what part of the house I am in if they want to find me. reading this little book let me know about other cats that are smart, loved and cherished as my cats are."
4,"The ""something different"" that I have been looking for","The title was was first caught my eye. I've been looking for something different to read when I ran across this book. I thought it was good. I wouldn't say it was laugh out loud funny, but there were some funny lines throughout the book. I kinda see it as the ""all-purpose"" book. It has a touch of humor mixed in with romance and just a hint of a mystery. At the end I wondered if this is the beginning of a new series.... Hmm.... something for the authors to seriously consider."
2,"Eeek, I didn't like it","I bought this book on a whim and didn't not care for it. Throughout most of the books was some Texas humor that I enjoyed however I didn't care for the hero. There was very little chemistry that I felt between him and the heroine. The plot was iffy too. There were points in the book where I had to stop and say ""What on earth"". For myself I did not enjoy this book and ended up skimming many pages."
1,Horrible book,"Well, I guess if you are in 5th grade you would find this book funny and would live in Texas. Poorly written, terrible plot. Written by two sisters with way too much time on their hands. How this ever got published is beyond me. I did not find this book funny at all. And why would a woman who LOVED her husband decide to divorce him to be a rodeo barrel queen? Good thing I bought this used."
4,"Since You're Leaving, You Might As Well Take Out the Trash","Since I have lived in West Texas all of my life, I could probably relate to this book better than most. You could tell it was written by Texans, and I thought it was a hoot. Some parts of it were laugh-out-loud hilarious! Good easy read!"
3,A Great Book...if You Take the Time,"""Victory in Singleness"" is a great book if you can get into it. The way that it is structured, with the three sections of the book each focusing on a different emoiton, can be somewhat of a turnoff for people who do not feel they are struggling with a particular issue. However, if you remain open, you will likely find some helpful advice. I read it for a bookclub and it seemed to resonate more with women who have been single for longer periods of time and who may have dealt with more of these issues. I suspect that more people would be interested in this book if it contained more anecdotes to illustrate some of the points."
4,Solid overall sound but only one complaint.............,"They clearly imitated the chord structure from one of Radiohead's songs titled 'Let Down' on the British bands 'OK Computer' album. Asside from this blatant ramake of chord structures on Luna Halo's track #4, this cd is quite pleasant. Even track #4, the culprit of the melay, provides a very nice tune. This is one of the finer alternate Christian cd's that has been developed over the last few years."
4,Oh MY.......,"This is a great CD for Christian fans and just plain, Pop/Rock fans. They have a fantastic sound that is nothing like the ""Backstreet Boys"". So if you are searching for a fresh new artist, look no futher. Luna Halo has made a wonderful debut album, that almost anyone can enjoy."
4,The sky is crying,"I enjoyed this book! I would like to see the authors go into a little more detail about S.R.V. when they made the album.But other than that, I highly recommend it."
2,APC Double Trouble,"My APC SmartUPS 750 failed within a year (the device, not the battery). It was good that they sent a replacement unit under warranty, although I had to return the old one... expensive because these are heavy. The battery of the replacement unit lasted 22 months vs. the advertised ""3 to 5 years"".APC positions itself as a premium product. The pricing is premium, but unfortunately no longer the product."
5,The only really good fire ant killer.,Bengal is the only fire ant killer that works on my farm. When ever they get it at Lowe's it sells out the first day. I have tried other products and nothing else works.
4,understandable as an ecosystem,"The authors provide more than just a superficial descriptive tour of the oceans. The text delves into studying the ocean as an ecosystem or subsets of it, as ecosystems in their own right. The food chain provides one way of understanding an ecosystem, and the adaptations that various creatures have for the niches they occupy. Here, the authors start from first principles, with the photosynthetic species and the depths which they occupy.The book also shows that at the ocean bottoms, even with no photosynthesis, there is still a rich environment for benthic species.The diagrams are well done and readily understandable. The biochemistry is pretty simple, but this is just an introductory text."
2,"All right, Fire, you can stop any time now...","Know what this is? That's right! It's the seven hundred thirty-eigth attempt by Fire to cash in on their ownership of the early Pulp catalogue! Well whaddaya know...specifically, this set contains the It album and the Masters of the Universe compilation in their entirety. And that's all. No bonus tracks or anything. Just your average run-of-the-mill crass and pointless quickie job. Just never gets old, does it? Of course, it doesn't help that these are Pulp's two weakest CDs, either--I suppose if you're a completist like me and you don't yet have those two you could save a few bucks by buying this, but somebody needs to give the money-grubbing gits at Fire a good kicking."
5,"An album of ""transformation"" and ""transportation""!","This album is an underrated classic. ""Una Muy Bonita"" is the ultimate in cool swank: it swaggers out of your speakers and transforms your soul through its rhythmic beat and fun feel. ""Summer Nights"" really struck me as well: this pituresque tune can transport you to a quiet moment when you've drawn away from the crowd for a moment to have a quick smoke by yourself...you can hear the rain falling at night and the cocktail party going on in the background all at once. ""Stick-Up"" made me a fan of Bobby Hutcherson. You can waste your time borrowing this from the library to see if you'll like it, but falling for this album is only a matter of time."
4,Rhino Wire Labler,I like1. good sticky labels and ease of availability2. Low cost device.3. great legibility of print4 some of the shortcuts are Useful.I don't Like1. Non qwerty keyboard (Electricians aren't that stupid)2. Non Laminated labels3. I would not consider this a high production label maker ( but with practice and a good print it would be faster)
2,gradually we learn the problems and limitations,"I don't use this labeler often and for the variety of labels offered. Being in the telecom business we use star * and pound # for dialing. This stupid printer does not offer # even in the extended choices menu. Tech support has no upgrade, fix or trade-in.My buddy bought these a year ago and has found removing labeling back very hard. No help from Dymo.I find that certain sizes of labels get stuck as they feed; lovely.I'll buy another brand next time. These handhelds have been out long enough to have corrected these problems and oversights.Bye Bye Dymo."
5,Great b-sides!,"This is a great single for Kylie fans. It includes two b-sides from the FEVER album, ""Tightrope"" and ""Good Like That"". They are both great songs that should have been on the album. Buy it for that reason alone, for the b-sides. ""In Your Eyes"" is a nice song, it was the second single from FEVER (except it was not released as a single in the US). ""Good Like That"" is my favorite, it's very Kylie and very catchy! Worth buying!"
2,"buena idea, sin concretar. No merece el nombre""Brasilero""","este cd intenta ser una introduccion en la variada musica de brasil.Los interpretes varian de famosos a ignotos. Los temas distan de ser los mejores de cada uno . podemos acceder a diferentes ritmos ,y nuevas voces que son dificiles de encontrar : nazare pereira,sylvia torres o conocer a otros chico cesar, zeca baleiro,etc. Es muy desparejo en la calidad musical, y no permite apreciar la riqueza de los diferentes ritmos e interpretes. Las ausencias son notorias, pero es inevitable,en la amplia musica de brasil. No es un gran cd, solo nos aproxima, no transmite la riqueza musical enorme de ese pais y`para el que no conoce puede darle una imagen deslucida y erronea."
1,Too bad....,"I'm in agreement with the person who said there is much better music from Brazil than this cd gives us. There are a couple of good singers on here, but 2 out of 14 ain't great odds.If you want a good Brazilian album get some of the classics. Most of this music is kind of ugly."
2,Brasil has far better to offer than this,"Brasil produces some of the finest musicians, singers, and composers in the world. They are innovators of great charm and beauty. This collection does nothing to showcase the music of Brasil.True there are a few good cuts...Silvia Torres, Rosa Passos and Clara Nunes all sound wonderful. The sweet voiced Passos is singing Jobim, so it's hard to go wrong there.For some reason I keep buying Putumayo collections hoping to hear wonderful music from around the world. The concept is excellent. Bring out representative collections of non-commercial music, whether by location or genre, introducing music lovers to sounds they have never been exposed to and are likely to fall in love with. Invariably I'm disappointed in Putumayo's selections. There is so much good music out there...how do they manage to find so little of it?"
1,Yuk!,Save your money. The only two songs on here worth listening to are probably available on a good anthology. The rest of this cd sounds like it was made by a lot of untalented amateurs who couldn't afford real instruments.
5,It doesn't get any easier than this!,"The price made me investigate this camera for my daughter's birthday, but when I used it I wanted to keep it for myself!!! This camera is SO easy to use and figure out. The user manual is clear and straight forward, and you even get a case with it!! My ""good"" digital camera didn't come with a case! This is a great ""first"" digital camera for the kids that they can learn to use in a snap!"
1,Three strikes,"I was given this camera for Christmas, 2003, and it stopped working one month later. We live in Spain, so we were told to send it to be serviced in Barcelona. From Barcelona, it was sent to France. We received it back months later, and it worked for 4 days.Last July, while on vacation at home in the States, I sent it to the service center in California, requesting the camera be replaced. I received a ""replacement"" camera in August, which stopped working six months later. I am now fed up with Vivitar and I have bought another brand.If my three experiences are any indication, you can expect this camera to work an average of 71.3 days, so you should make every day count!"
1,"Waste of time for general reader, historicians only","I find it very hard to understand how a work about ""Modern"" religious movements should be helpful - if the stopping point is 1913! This edition was published by ""Low Price Publications"" in Delhi, and that's what it looks/feels like. There may be some historical nuggets to harvest if read really thoroughly - but except for some historicians I doubt many people will take the toil to do so. In my opinion this book should carry a warning tag because of its publication date and I'm rather disappointed with it, but I appreciate the thorough and critical treatment of Theosophy. Generally this book flows over with information, but I'd be critical whether it is not outdated. If you can use it anyway - all the best to you."
4,At last! Someone who gets it!,"In her essays on life in a home, Dominique Browning, editor of House & Garden, offers her own intensely personal experience with the ways in which the home environment affects and is affected by divorce, self-esteem, and vice versa.Her descriptions of her rooms, her struggle to find a good living room couch (after successfully finding a kitchen sofa), her explanations of plants and flowers to her young sons, all create the feeling that you are on the phone with an old friend working to describe her evolving life. Her deep understanding of the ways in which our environments affect us (for better, for worse, just like marriage) leads the readers to feel like the changes we've been tempted to make might just be logical after all."
3,Beware of the Wide size,"I purchased two pairs of these shoes in size 9W. Although they looked great, and the length was fine, the shoe width didn't quite add up. They felt more like medium width. The brown leather were a little looser than the nubucks but neither felt like a standard wide width shoe from Rockport. I've had previous Rockports and 9W always fit regardless the style."
2,Vibram sole marks like crazy,"The Vibram soles leave black streaks all over the floors, and make it so I cannot wear them at work. I love Rockports in general, and these are comfortable and well made as expected, but they leave a trail of scuff marks."
5,My new favorites,"The Rockport Men's Brooklands Waterproof Oxfords are outstandingly comfortable, I don't even bother to take them off after work. Totally waterproof and yet your feet don't sweat in them at all. I like the black/leather ones that can do work or casual duty. I am particularly pleased with the classic, plain and simple styling - no square or pointed toe, no weird sewing pattern or cap toe either - simply a beautifully formed one piece toe that says ""quality workmanship"" all over it. Indeed the craftsmanship in this shoe is second to none, and the cushioning is more than adequate for long stints walking on concrete. Buy them, you'll like them."
1,PUD is as F*(^%ED As the Dot Coms,"This book is a very sad rant by Pud (Kapaln), himself a washed out dot.commer.Here is a guy who rips into many companies from which he ran banners on his site. They became F&*#ED when he could not longer get them to advertise. (HotJobs for example.)Anyone who actually is able to learn anything from this garbage probably did not pass Business 1A. All in all, a waste of paper."
4,"George Carlin, you've got competition!","As a long-time follower of F**dcompany.com (at least since June, 2000), I knew what I'd be getting from *PUD*: The plain and ugly truth. Kaplan's introduction should be an entire book itself. After reading the intro, you will no longer look at the geeky guy in the small cubicle typing away the same way again. Kaplan writes in this book EXACTLY what we're all thinking about the companies who have started up fast, but melted (or burned) away even faster!No financial analysis, no historical look into their psyche, just a summary of ""what the ... were they thinking???""A perfect book for a quick flight from Atlanta to New York!"
2,Yawn,"I wasn't expecting much, and boy did I get it. Not only is this book short in length, each commentary is ridiculously short and often devoid of any relevant content at all...the title pretty much says it all, but if people are paying this guy for his insights, they deserve to get f'd for their own idiocy. He's right, he's nobody special, but he happened to be in the right place in the right time and he tapped a vein that's made him rich and relatively famous. Lucky, very lucky. But not brilliant or insightful by any stretch of the imagination.Don't buy this stupid mini-book. Borrow it from a friend, or your clueless coworker, and laugh at the first dozen anecdotes because they'll be funny. Then you'll realize... the book doesn't go anywhere else, but it goes on and on and on... and you'll give it back an hour later, glad you didn't buy it.Just like most of us who didn't buy into the whole snake oil scam now known as ""Dot-Com's""."
3,Limited audience,"Pud, as F*edCompany folks will tell you, is a deity, albeit of ill repute. He's boorish, brutal, bombastic, and probably not someone you'd want to sit next to on a plane. But he'd probably be great at a party, and if you take that approach, you might like the book.F*edCompanies is actually a pretty good treatise on the dotcom demise and general hubris of the time, one that doesn't tax your intellect too much, (and insults it a good bit of the time). I've never found Pud particularly funny, but he can be insightful more often than you'd think. Here he's written a book that you may not keep on your permanent bookshelf, but is worth a read."
1,Not worth purchasing at any price,"If you read pud's website, you've already read this book. There is nothing new here, nothing that a dozen other books out there don't do better."
2,... book,"While I realize the book is not fiction, Kaplan violates a rather basic tenet of story-writing: making the protaganist (himself) even somewhat likeable. While it's clear he enjoys playing the bad [guy], you can only make allusions to excrement so many times before the whole exercise becomes painful.Too bad -- the tales of dotcom demise themselves would have been interesting, if only someone else had written them up."
1,A Hemingway in the making!,"Pure genius! Mr. Kaplan's insight into the Dot-com fiasco is a spine tingling, nail biting, edge-of-your-seat thriller.My only complaint is that there isn't a sequel (yet :).Bravo Mr. Kaplan!"
5,Readthisbook.com,Pud doesn't Pull punches He beats the Heck out all .comsAnd some of the most messed up Biz plans ever concievedPud's Book and website Should be a .com Biz class On what not to do! Even in the 21st Century the old Biz plan still holds Buy low sell high Or at least have a Product to sell!! Of course i don't know what im talking about so Buy the book!!
1,If you want a GREAT read...,"Buy a tofu cookbook, a plastic infant teething book (you know, the kind with the squeaky pages), or hey - a phone book... it's free, and much more interesting. I took this book into the bathroom at my local chain bookstore (begins with a B) when I had an emergency. And can you believe it, the bathroom was out of paper! Fortunately, I had this book with me, and I must say that while the pages had kind of a rough edge to them, if you wet them a bit first they make for decent emergency bathroom tissue."
5,F'd Company,"I'd love to read this book since I have been down sized and have a lot of time on my hands, but how can we buy a books when we are all out of work?"
1,what a loser--packed full of useless information,"I'm embarassed I bought this book. It's written poorly, and there's useless information."
4,Philip Kaplan has done it again,"giving it 5 stars would be a bit of a stretch, but overall I found it to be a great read from beginning to end.quite an eye opener, giving you a behind the scenes look into the seedy world of dotcoms.too bad about the ugly cover, even though that shade of red is my favorite."
1,"Waste of time, money, paper and ink",All he offers in this very badly book is found for free in his own website and elsewhere in the web. He can't write and his sense of humor is lame and boring.
4,An extremely guilty pleasure,"I'm a classics and linguistics major who's occasionally dated engineers, but I really have almost no insight into these companies and the corporate culture that bred them. Kaplan provides a hilariously profane catalogue of the worst offenders, explaining their failures, discussing what would've worked, and more than once talking about jacking off.I found this a great insight into the mid-to-late 90s and a wonderfully funny read. I'm deducting a star for repetitive mechanics and sometimes-incorrect punctuation (just because you're a computer man doesn't mean that you shouldn't even try). That being said, it's pretty neat to have a tour guide who grew up wallowing in the midst of all this, so he feels no shame in saying things like ""BUT HEY, THEY HAD 20 MILLION PAGEVIEWS A DAY! Douchebags.""Buy it; it's well worth your money."
2,"Not journalism, mostly inuendo","I enjoyed f'dcompany.com during the big flame-out of 2000-2001. It was nice to see which other companies were going under while mine (ubo.com) was in the process of being f'd. The book is written in the same cras, irreverent, obscene style as the website and that is entertaining in small batches.My complaint is that in the only case I know of for sure, ubo.com (Chapter 10, Party Like It's 1999), Kaplan's facts are very f'd up. For example, the company didn't rent Liberty Island for the launch party, it was Ellis island and the company was in business for over 18 months, not ""less than a year.""You may say these are little details and they are, but if Kaplan puts this stuff in print I expect it will go down in the annals of history as fact. I can only imagine how much of the rest of the book is pure rumour or speculation on Kaplan's part.I am glad that someone caught the moment in print, but what good is it really if a lot of it is factually incorrect?"
2,Highly dissappointing,Not much here that hasn't been said a thousand times before in the media about the excesses of the dotcom bubble. The author appears to be a master of self-promotion. This can be the only reason behind him being able to publish a book. It certainly isn't due to his insight or writing skills.
3,"Painfully fun, appropriate and entertaining.","I enjoyed the book, and certainly appreciate it's message. (i.e. the dot-com company emperor has no clothes). True, it may not be a work of literature, but it has an important message for everyone. Dare I say it is lightly akin to Michael Moore's early documentary film work - not too technically savvy and sexy, but the message is necessary, appropriate and timely. And the delivery is right on. The point of a business is to exercise financial (investment and shareholder) responsibility and social (employee and customer) responsibility. The point of a business is not to prove you can spend the finances. These are mini Enron's, which combined can have a more cumulatively more damaging result than Enron itself. Read the book - tell people about the book and the web site."
1,Simple ...,"If you've been reading the papers or watching TV for the past few years you probably know most of the ""information"" contained in this book already. Nothing new. Similar to a long magazine article that would normally be free on the web...."
1,Can I vote less than 1 star?,"this book isn't worth the paper it was written on. Poorly written, no insightfulness, and nothing new. This was a bad purchase."
2,Book is baaad,"I didn't buy Pud's book but read it in the book store. I think it ... It has a lot of profanity, bad grammar, poor syntax etc etc.. It is by no means a substantive piece of work. You have to be an ignorant x-gen ... with poor diction, vocabulary and a combined IQ of Beavis and Butthead to like this book.Read dot.con by Cassidy. It is well written."
4,If you like the daily Fs....,Then this is the book for you. Same insider feel and pud-ish humor as the site and sporadic emails but even more of the behind the scenes scoop. Too bad the F'd .coms didn't have a marketing plan as good as this book and all the other FC spin offs.
1,"Been there, done that...",Another dot com bubble book released about a year too late. Nothing to see here. Isn't it all just a repeat of the website content anyway?
1,"Too glossy, no meat","I was expecting a little more substance from the book, perhaps some deeper examples and some better analysis and dirt and gossip from the wackoes that ran these dot coms, but the book was no more than a listing with a blurb at best on a whole stack of companies that went under. The blurbs were funny to read at first, but get old and dull pretty fast, and the whole thing ends up being a fun read for no more than 10 pages. It's a shame, I would think there's a lot of good dirt to dredge up and write about, and I was hoping this would touch on that, but it doesn't. I would skip this one."
4,Better than I expected,"This was a lot better than I expected. Yes, the language is beyond Carlin-esque. But if you can deal with that, it's the definitive catalog of the wackiest business ideas that people tried during the late 90's, both those of the wide-eyed idealists and of the scammers.And it IS funny... Kaplan has a knack for nailing the fundamental stupidity of these plans. Only criticism is that sometimes he oversimplifies what's involved in building web applications, ""hire a high school kid, tell him what you want your website to do."" Of course, sometimes it is that simple, but not always.But overall, it's a delight... it's much more fun reading a page or two on each of 150 bad ideas..."
1,This book is fairly good for wiping ones arse,If you want a overpriced arsewiper go ahead and but this book.This book is absolute garbage for a read. My son in highschool can write better
1,Just plain bad!,If you must read.. read in the book store and toss it on your way out.Don't expect King Lear here. This book is so bad that the fact that it is selling well scares me. Are we as Americans really that stupid or are we just a country of skate board riding baboons?Avoid this book! It is written by the someone profoundly intent on making money on cheese and sleaze. Don't look for any vestiges of class here. In 10 years America will be well into the slippery slope down to ignorance and apathy.
2,Nothing New,"It appears as if the author through together tidbits from his website postings and wrote this book in an hour or two.He offers little-to-no insight regarding the demise of these companies.The book is also full of incorrect information (Paul Allen does not own the Seattle Sonics, he owns the Portland Trailblazers, Fizzylab was not an ecommerce company...)"
1,buy this book if you like rehashed dot com whinning!,"This book is as played out as the website. Pud's bitter resentment for the dot com sector was interesting for a few days a year ago, but now it seems old and tired. Everyone knows about the dot com thang. I thought at least this book would offer some interesting insights, but no. Played out."
3,If you've read the website..the book may not be for you,"I love the website and love Pud's view of the world. Many times he has suceeded in stating exactly what everyone has been thinking but he says it in a way that really makes you laugh (and think). This book however, seems like a mash of the website-so if you didn't follow the site and the dailys, this book is for you. If you are a fan of the site-just beware-you may feel you've read this all before.As an aside-Pud's column after the 9/11 attacks was one of the best written by anyone anywhere and worth a re-print someplace."
3,"Cute,but not helpful for my son","When i received it, I was so glad, It's really cute toy. However, my son has no interesting with it. when he cry, I give it to him, he still cry. And also need my arms to sleep. So....It just waste money,It's made in China,I am suspicious of its quality too"
3,Almost returned it,"The monitor is useful for white noise, the bear not so much. My 7 week old can't tell the difference yet, though he does like the soothing noise of nothing"
2,This turns off!,"I think I jumped too quick with this product. It's super cute and cuddly, but it turns off after like 5 min and then is activated again by movement. So, I turn it on, baby falls asleep. It turns off, baby wakes up. Baby starts to move, it turns on and scares her. Then I have a crying baby. Not the ideal situation. I ended purchasing the Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound Machine. It has options to turn off or stay on. Works much better for my little one."
2,Good idea needs improvement,For the first few weeks my daughter was not affected by this product. But after the 3rd week it really helped her fall asleep and stay asleep but it only lasts for 5 min. I had to stand by her crib and touch it every time it went off until she was fast asleep. Unfotunately my daughter needs 15-30 minutes so it is very cumbersome. I would not recommend this product unless they added a longer mode.
5,Lifesaver for my daughter,"This is a great item ! My 3 week old daughter loves to sleep on my chest and I was having a hard time getting her down at night ... She only wanted to sleep on me! We have attached it to the side of her crib and for the last week we have been able to just put her down and when she moves or cries it automatically comes on to sooth her! It has been a lifesaver for both me and my husband ! I highly recommend this item, My husband and I now have our nights to ourselves and she is content with the noise of the heartbeat and it doesnt have to be me :)"
3,works sometimes,"I can't say it's a magic pill to calm down our new baby. It works ""sometimes"" when the baby is just bored or need attention. When she is hungry and need diaper change, it's not effectively. She just didn't get ""fooled"" at all"
3,OK,"If the sound device is in the bear, you can barely hear it and the thing eats through batteries like there is no tomorrow. It does work at calming my baby though when she wakes up in the middle of the night. I saw the best results once we took it out of the bear."
2,I wish it would have worked out,"The sound portion of this product failed within 30 days and it was replaced in a timely manner. The replacement also failed within two months....My baby really liked this product, I wish this review could be better."
3,Cute but had to return,"I bought this because it is so much cuter than the Sleep Sheep. It is good quality, and I think we might have loved it, BUT the Velcro on the paws did not stick together, and the arms were not long enough to reach securely around our crib slats. I had to return it because there was no way to attach it to our crib, but this may not be a problem for everyone."
2,"Helpful, but not enough!","The problems with this bear are that the sound doesn't stay on long enough (only 5 minutes!) and the sound and motion activator is not sensitive enough! My daughter had to scream into the device with it right in front of her to activate it and by then she is too worked up and too loud for her to hear the womb sound to calm her down. The womb sound works for her, she just needed something that stayed on longer. We ended up exchanging this item for the ""Sound Sleeper"", which works wonders! I recommend that rather than this bear-- and the ""Sound Sleeper"" is less expensive!"
2,"Fine Toy, Not an Effective Pacifier","We purchased the Slumber Bear for our two-week-old daughter in the hopes that it would help lull her back to sleep when she awakened in the middle of the night. While the bear itself may eventually be of use as a generic toy, the audio pacifier has not been at all effective in the anticipated pacifying efforts. The audio/motion detector is only triggered 50% of the time when our daughter screams directly at it, and oftentimes I've needed to give it several good, solid whacks to get it to play. When it does play, the audio track of womb sounds has had no impact on her crying. I acknowledge that it may work better for some children, but ours is not one of them. I should note that our daughter is not what would be considered colicky or otherwise overly fussy."
4,A life saver!,"My mother sent this to me when my daughter was first born. I tossed it to the back of the closet and wrote it off as a gimmick. We really didn't need it right away. It wasn't until she was a little older that we started having sleep issues. For more than eight months we struggled. First we struggled to get her to fall asleep, then we struggled to get her to stay asleep. Our pediatrician didn't think there was anything we could do. There were nights when she woke up nearly once an hour. I pulled this out and put it on her crib one night. Every time she woke up, moved around, or started to cry, the bear would go off. She would fall back to sleep in minutes. Two months later and it still works great! Now she sleeps through the night.The only reason I give this product 4 out of 5 stars is because it eats through batteries pretty quickly."
4,cute,Its very cute but I had wanted one that you could record your own heart beat this product has its own pre recorded but its still a good product
4,"Ronan ""All of Him""","In the book ""Halfway Home-My Life til Now"" Ronan talks about family and those whom he has met so far in his life. He also talks about the women he has slept with so far. Which I find appalling, and just plain bad taste. He should apoligize to the women he talks about in the book. I wouldn't let anyone under the age of 21 to read this book. Keep it away from children."
2,Less Than Expected,"The book has some useful information for rookies but doesn't have the specific detailed info I expected from the pepple who used to publish the Oasis state-by-state books.Most of the book is about the generalitites of setting up a business and not how to do it in South Carolina. I have had my business (a corporation) for 20+ years, starting it in California using an Oasis book and moving it from California to New Hampshire with the help of Oasis binder-style book. This doesn't measure up in moving from New Hampshire to South Carolina. It's basically $20 for a list of phone numbers and addresses."
3,Not enough information,Part of the book was general which covers all states and part covered South Carolina. I felt there was not enough on South Carolina alone.
4,The Most Unique Voice....Luv It!!!!,"I have Ayo's other project, Joyful, but I wasn't aware she had release another project, Gravity At Last. I love Ayo's unique voice, that sexy growl is bone chillin'. Her lyrics are heartfelt which goes well with her acoustic guitar. This is another exemplary project by her. Currently my favorite tracks are I Am Not Afraid, Love And Hate, and Better Days, I sure my favorite list will grow over time.... This is music at it finest with talented musicians...no computers here!!!"
4,Refreshing,"Ayo is a refreshing change from all of the headaches of the world. Her voice takes you away to a happy place. Her idealistic sentiment on ""Help is Coming"" makes you believe you can do something to ease the suffering. I have not listened to a cd constantly ever & this is on repeat!"
1,More like a pamphlet,"This book reads more like a pamphlet, with a very basic summary of a man's career. The selected stories are spotty at best. Obviously the Author was more interesting in making money than chronicling one of the most famous performers in pro wrestling, especially considering the many other 'The Story Of' ""books"" he's done. After finishing it in 15 minutes, it reminded me of one of my son's 5th grade book reports.As someone else mentioned, there are also many errors. The pictures are more valuable than the knowledge contained within it."
1,Imagine this...,"A man who gets popular by cursing, drinking, and using lewd body language gets a biography meant for little kids. This man is not what children should be learning about. But I sound like an old lady..The entire book was in character. It was basically the story of his wrestling career dumbed down. Too many good things were left out. Too many lies were put in. This book was horrible and I'm afraid to read Ross' OTHER wrestling biographies."
3,nice gate poor delivery,I have had this gate before and I love it. When I received this gate one of the slats was broken. I was in a pinch for time so I could not sent it back and re-order.I used my trusty gorilla glue and all was well.I did not contact buyer because I assume the damage was in shipping. Again it was a time issue.
3,An OK gate among limited options,"Considering there are limited options for pet gates that span over 72"", this gate is worth considering if you have a wide doorway that you are trying to block off to keep your pets contained in a certain area of your home. The pros are: 1) The gate expands out to 96"" and can be slid back to 53"" when not being used (and can be quickly and easily removed if desired), and 2) installation is easy. The cons are: 1) the gate is on the flimsy side (when our 20 lb puppy leans on the top of it, the gate really bows and leans--so much so we started putting a chair against it in the middle so the puppy wouldn't topple it over), and 2) you're going to have to put small holes in your walls to put the screw-in eyelets in that the gate clips to. The gate does perform its function and keeps our puppy from destroying our entire house when we are not at home, so in a world of limited options, this gate is definitely worth considering if you have a wide span to block."
4,four paws pet gate,"Perfect for what we needed it for(keeping little elderly dogs out from under foot in the kitchen)!! Great value, but not for people who have dogs that will constantly push against the gate or puppies who chew."
3,I suppose it will work...,"Shipping was great, product is just OK. It requires bolts/screws in the wall in order to stay up which I didn't really want but figured I could deal with since I needed a gate ASAP. Product is not as wide as I expected. It is cheap and not very sturdy. It works for what I need it for (luckily I didn't need to bolt it into the wall, it has something to lean on in order to keep it upright) and I guess it's an OK buy for the price, however I think I could have found something aesthetically more pleasing and durable for maybe a few dollars more."
4,Just a bit short.,"gate arrived very fast, very good quality. just a bit short (by <>2"") easily fixed. Does the trick for what we needed!"
5,the gate was a great price and works very well!,the gate was just what we were looking for and the company was promp and took care of us very well!
3,Enjoyable but not great,"An unnamed Middle Eastern country is preparing to invade Europe. A small group of bright minds, trying to convince the European governments to arm for the coming war, find their members killed of one after the other. Next on the list is Tweed, who gathers his team of agents to find the killers, a group of mysterious women, led by the son of the Head of State of the unnamed Middle Eastern country.Their journey takes them from England to Vienna, Zürich and Slovakia. As usual in Forbes's books, much time is spent in hotels and there's plenty of dialog, and Tweed and his team owe as much of their successes to luck as to skill. But there's also a fair share of action and despite its flaws (stilted dialog and plenty of clichés, and the pace could have been somewhat faster), ""The Sisterhood"" is an enjoyable, but not great, book."
3,Wish I could have seen them first hand before I ordered.,"I have had a set of Corelle for over 25 years and thought it was time for a new one. I was disappointed that this set is not as heavy as the one I have. It just felt ""cheaper"". Also, REALLY did not like the glasses that came with it. Someone else's review said they were heavy, but I did not find that to be true. They are very light weight, and when I pulled out the rack in my dishwasher after washing them for the first time, one fell against the other and broke. BEFORE I HAD EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO USE THEM!!!!!!! I still gave this a 3 star because I do like the design, and I'm hoping that Corelle is still making a product that lasts for years!!"
5,great product!!!,"What I liked most about this product is it came with glasses rather than coffee cups....corelle is always a good buy the product is attractive, can be used for everyday as well as for entertaining.....is durable, and this pattern is usable in any decor...."
3,Poorly Shipped,"Correlle is good dinnerware for daily use. The shipment of the product was happard at best. Many pieces came broken, but the hassel to reship and return is too much. Thin cardboard separates the dishes in transit, then packed in flimsy oversized boxes, poorly taped, by amazon with the airpillows for cushioning through the regular mail. Poorly done. If this is how Amazon packs its glassware I strongly recommend not to purchase any. There is no other avenue to complain to Amazon about their packing."
4,Good Product....just as described,"Great for everyday use. Glasses are light weight...not very thick, but pretty. Great buy for the price! I'm a happy customer."
5,Simple and timeless,"This set will not disappoint. I could not decide on a Corelle pattern because I couldn't imagine looking at the same dots, flowers, etc. for the next several years. I do not usually like plain white but the wave-like detail really make them unique. The glasses are heavier and thicker glass than the dishes. I highly recommend these if you want dishes that are attractive and will stand the test of time!"
5,Corelelle enhancements are fabulous,"I have used these corelle enhancements for over 14 years now and they look nice, hold up well, and go with everything. I have kids and the dishes are tough to break but when they do, I am glad they are still available. The glasses are pretty and just the right weight. Of course, with a sixteen year old loading the dishwasher, two have already broken but that is just how it goes, not the glasses fault."
3,Poor delivery,"I ordered several sets of these dishes some came by regular U.S. mail, they were wonderful. The second set came that same day by UPS. They were broken. In fact they were so broken that they UPS man shook the box on my doorstep to allow me to hear all of the broken glass. AMAZON does not put ""FRAGILE"" on their boxes for some odd reason. I do belive that since this dish set had glasses in it, that those were the items that broke. I refused the package, so I didn't see how they were packed inside. Reordering was very easy though."
5,the best ever,"Recently I bought 16-piece dinnerware, service for 4 and I honestly can tell that they are the best ever.It's easy to use them, wash them and I dropped one on the floor and I thought this is it but miracle didn't break.I highly recommend this product to everybody."
5,Love this set,"This matches the set i already have. I just needed more plates. It was wonderful to be able to order additional dishes without getting more cups and saucers. Getting glasses instead was a wonderful alternative. I highly recommend this set, and Corelle dishes in general. Can't imagine life with kids without Corelle."
5,"Stories so terrible that only fiction can suffice, but filled with hope","Stories so terrible that only fiction can suffice, but filled with hope."
2,dissapointed,"Way too much fiction and full of distracting irrelevant ""fill-in"" details. Written for the ""tourist"" in mind - not for the intelligent, educated person."
5,Decorating the man cave...,I love Jack Daniel's and this tin sign is exactly what I expected. High quality and construction! Sure to be a joy for any Jack fan's collection.
2,Useless,"I've ordered this item two pieces with #PHB5519 for my Acura MDX, but finally received two items #PHB5667, absolutely wrong size and useless, plus also white material no any carbon filler as on picture."
3,Seeking the Anasazi,"The Anasazi are perhaps best known for their adobe and stone villages built in the American Southwest. This video will show you several examples, including Mesa Verde and the famous Chaco Canyon. The history of their ""discovery"" in the 1800s is traced, as well as an analysis of why the people living here suddenly left between the 12th and 13th centuries.Several theories are explored, including weather patterns, drought, and changes in religious beliefs, but no one can say for sure. The idea that cannibalism was practiced is also discussed, but this is hotly debated by historians and modern Pueblo Indians, and there is no consensus. What is known is the villages were eventually abandoned. Did the Anasazi disappear from the pages of history? Or did they relocate to more fertile areas and mix with the inhabitants of those regions?Three stars. Interesting program but no clear cut answers."
1,Confessiones of a Crazed Addict,This book was poorly wrtten and did not entertain at all. There are many other books on traders and trading that are much more exciting. Cramer seems to be very much full of himself here. More recent accounts have brought to light some nefarious activity by Cramer and his hedge fund. Send a copy to Elliot Spitzer.
3,The scam that is Wall St....,"With a rolodex of of brokers, analysts and CEO's at their fingertips... Cramer & Co. spent their day hyping or deflating stocks (depending on whether they were long or short), or just trying to get a reading of where the analyst community was (hoping to short or long the stocks -- which they would then go on to hype or deflate)... in the end, of course, the poor sucker holding the bag was John Q. Public.So is this what hedge fund managers spend their day doing? Is this what trading was to Cramer & Co. (manipulating and in cahoots with Wall St. analysts)? Are analysts nothing but cheerleaders for their favorite stock of the day?Oh, what a web of deceit and collusion Wall St. is..."
1,Not What It Appears To Be,"Cramer does not make any confessions in this book. The book's narrative is done in a way that Cramer lets the reader know only what he wants him to know. In other words, the information is overly managed and provides few insights into Cramer as a confession would. This style makes good copy for lawyers and nerds, but is rather stale and dull for readers who are looking for more substance. I am sorry to say that this book is more about marketing and hype than a good story."
5,An Investors Adventure,"As someone who loves the market,and has watched James Cramer at every opportunity, I found this book full of interesting revelations. For example, I was online reading ""Thestreet.com"" in October 1998 when Cramer gave the alert to get out of the market immediately. He wrote, at the time, that his wife, ""the Trading Goddess, said it was time to throw in the towel. In the book he admits, that she was trading like crazy at the time and the last thing she wanted was to get out; he capitulated at the very bottom of the bear market. One of the best things about the book is his honesty, showing both his strengths and frailties, his hits and misses. I love and respect the guy even more now. Living several decades on the street called Wall; he has been there and takes you along on the journey. A great read!"
4,"Questionable ethics, but great insight into the drive to succeed","Ok, I decided to read this one after I developed more of a habit of watching Mad Money. I started watching because I a little curious, but after a while I got sucked into the show from an entertainment standpoint. I don't take too much of his advice, so my portfolio has continued to go up. Still, I wondered about the man behind the show. What I found was someone who displayed questionable ethics, but how able to achieve at his chosen profession. From that standpoint, you are treated to some very useful insights into how you can be a success at whatever you do. Anyway, this is a very entertaining book, as well as readable. Get it and profit."
4,Thought it was excellent...,"Well written, and insightful. It gives you a view of Wall Street that you would otherwise not get. There seem to be a lot of people who do not like Cramer, and that is understandable. But, he is not kind to himself in this book, freely admitting his shortcomings and mistake.Worth a read, and very entertaining.KernanTRADEthemove.com"
4,The Fund Guy was not a Fun Guy But He is Now.,I really appreciated Cramer's book and the guts it took to tell his story. The events described are both on a career and personal level and are heartbreaking. I'm glad he made it through and shared his experiences with the rest of us. He's also a fine writer too.
1,The Game Stops,"I purchased this book because I have a keen interest in trading, having managed money for several years now. Although this book has some good points, as a whole it is not reflective of the mind or life of a trader. It seems to be more of an autobiography and not a very attractive one.I would urge others to stick with Schwager or Neiderhoffer. Or if you are particularly bearish, try James Grant."
3,Big time trading,"I have been reading JJC on TheStreet/Realmoney for five years, and I must say he is very entertaining, but except for a few instances his ideas has not been making me money, quite the opposite. I always wondered why such a poor stock picker could make such an impressive performance as a hedge fund manager. After reading this book, and another ""Trading with the enemy"", written by a former employee, I understand how he did it, but I also have to say, that except for his rigorous work ethics and his emphasis on keeping an open mind, there is little to be learned here. Unless you are a hedge fund manager or big time trader, his methods cannot be emulated. But the book is, as always when JJC write, very entertaining."
3,Interesting insight into the early years of Jim Cramer (Mad Money. Booyah!),Booyah! Interesting read into Jim's early as a hedge fund manager. Recommended for those who would like to get an insider insight into Jim's early years.
1,Confessions?,"I am part of a book club which selects new books to read for discussion. We selected this book expecting a book on trading and were extremely disappointed. The book rambled on with some kind of autobiographical story, but it was not worth following. I suggest Cramer stick to trading or whatever he does these days as he is no writer. Chalk this up to a mistake."
2,Good autobiography but bad investing book,"This book is more about his autobiography, and albiet amusing at times, isn't a real investing book. His other one: Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World is much better."
1,Self-boasting,I bought this book because I saw a recommendation somewhere together with One Up on Wall Street. I had my doubts when I saw the cover (close up of the author's face) and unfortunately when I began reading my fears became true. It is one big ad of Jim Cramer. I strongly recommend against buying it however One Up on Wall Street is highly recommended.
5,"Fascinating, Insightful, rip-roaring pace...","To all of the 'haters' out there, who are disgusted by J Cramer's actions during his life of trading, what do you think led him to be so successful over the 23 years? COMPLETE DEVOTION TO HIS PARTNERS. This was never meant to be a ""this is how you trade"" book; read the front jacket & you'll know it is about his life as a trader [not the ""how to"" but the ""what & why""].....I have read this book 3 times; pure greatness. If you want the ""how to"" from Cramer, then read him on RealMoney.com, or listen to his radio show....."
5,In The Middle Of It All,"This book is not about investing. Rather, it is about Cramer's interesting life and the millions he made and lost in the stock market in the past few decades. As a former journalist, Cramer writes well compared to most traders and the reader will have a hard time putting this book down once started. Cramer takes the reader from his days as a struggling journalist and Harvard law student to the hallowed halls of Goldman Sachs to his chaotic life as a hedge fund manager and media commentator. This book also provides good perspectives on the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the fallout of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management as well as the dotcom madness of the late 1990s. In many ways, Cramer was in the middle of it all and thus provides good insights in buying stocks in hard times. This book should be read by everyone interested in a job in the financial markets because, love him or hate him, this book will not disappoint."
5,Provides amazing insider detail,"Jim Cramer is often slammed as a hype artist, but this book gives intimate insight into his credibility, experience, and integrity. You not only learn valuable information about how ""the street"" works from an insider's perspective, but you get a captivating tale about the trials and tribulations of a dotcom startup. For those of us who are avid investors, this book is an educational resource. For those of us who lived through the dotcom boom and bust, Cramer should be lauded for the intimacy he provides with regards to his and his team's failings in running a start-up business during those times. Overall, this is an entertaining and insightful read, I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in investing in the market and those that are currently running or considering starting a new-economy business."
5,Great Book,Great book about Jim Cramer's life as a young author to being one of the most powerful wallstreet traders.
5,Page Turner,"This book was an excellent read. I could not put it down. I would wake up in the middle of the night and read, read, read. I loved the drama with thestreet.com It was so funny to read about how foolish he and Marty were with the CEO selections. They were multimillionaires and clueless on how to run operations for the dot com startup. Great Book!"
5,I loved it,"This book is a page turner. I would have read it in one sitting had that been possible. What a fascinating life you lead, Jim! I don't know how you handle the stress. Your wife deserves a lot of credit which you certainly give her in this book. Well done!"
4,A good read for outsiders that still like to trade..,"Liked this book. Cramer is straightforward and, at times, very humble in his posture. It goes to show you how a small trader, like a lot of us, can struggle against the insider big-dog tide. While everyone is anylizing charts, moving averages, Bolingers, candlesticks, et al, the real insiders trading word-of-mouth info at Wall St are the ones who really make the money.Good read and I highly recommend it if you are a amature stock junkie like myself."
1,Confessions of a Creep,"Ask him about ""laddering"" and other things that happend during dot com mania. Sadly the public has no idea."
1,Cramer Bear Market,"Read it and was not impressed. I suppose the end of the bull market comes when everyone gets tired of reading about the market, but in this case I grew tired of the storyline. Not too much about trading here. I am surprised Cramer has not caught more flak for some of the tricks he used to make money. If all hedge fund managers operate this way then this country is in one heck of alot of trouble."
5,Talking through percussion,"I got this for a higher price from a different seller than the one currently advertised, but am very satisfied with the drum. It arrived well packed in bubble wrap and in good condition, except for a loosened knot which was easy enough to fix. This is a great drum to have fun with since one single instrument can produce so many different pitches instantly with just a squeeze of an arm. It will be a good classroom prop if we happen to discuss African tone languages and talking drums in phonetics class; it could also be used to illustrate how taut vocal folds produce a higher pitch and relaxed ones a lower pitch. Demonstrations of how to play the drum can be found on YouTube. Recommended."
1,Not recommended,"I didn't care for this book. It's all about what can God do for me instead of how can I better know, love and serve God? If you want to light the fire in your faith life read writings/biographies/sermons from or about Saints. Yes, it won't be as entertaining but it will nourish your soul."
2,Probably not for clinicians,Although the book is intended for persons in the biological sciences it is very unlikely to be of much help to those in medical and clinical practice hoping to understand better the applications and interpretation of bioimpedance.
4,A fine guide to the Central Asian republics.,"Until recently, few westerners have ventured into the former Soviet republics of Central Asia; but there is a lot to see here: the Registan of Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva, Alamaty, the fading Aral sea, and remote (and possibly dangerous) Tajikistan. While some of the travel information is dated, this is the most comprehensive of the guidebooks to this area that is available. So, if you venture on the Golden Road to Samarkand, this is the one to take!"
1,Good pics but brief bio,"This large-format table-top picture book provides a wealth of photographs of John Burroughs but a very light and brief biography of the man. There is not much text. Great illustrations, but for details on JB's life go elsewhere."
1,Too brief,"There is a lot more to the story of John Burroughs than what is included here. We need to understand the social and historical context in which Burroughs lived and wrote, and Kanze does not help us."
5,"A fan in St. Croix Falls, WI: What a Wonderful Book!!","As a professional naturalist and outdoorswoman, I was drawn to the World of John Burroughs, and to Mr. Kanze's enthusiasm, sensitivity and love of this surprisingly uncelebrated naturalist. The author has thankfully reinstated John Burroughs' name among the great American conservationists, and has done so within the medium of lush, breathtaking photography. I feel positively drenched in John Burrough's world: the stunning outdoor photos, and the impressive wildlife photography combined with historic photos were a visual feast which allow a total immersion into John Burroughs' world. The visuals were enhanced by the personal sensitivity of the author and his gentle flair for storytelling, balanced by painstaking research, and an unassuming presentation of the facts. I enjoy Mr. Kanze's writings and look forward to his next book with great anticipation."
5,"Awesome, the best Terry Goodkind novel Yet!","Terry Goodkind is a fantastic author, he has proven that time and again, but this time...He exceeded ALL expectations. Richard and Kahlan. I laughed with them, I cried with them, I hurt with them, and I rejoiced with them! 5Stars!!!"
5,"MORE,MORE AND MORE!!!","As always, Terry Goodkind has mesmerized me once again. Since being introduced to him in November, I have read the entire Sword of Truth series. I have never read material so fulfilling. The Temple of the Winds, for me, was the most captivating. He is a very descriptive writer and it is this eye for detail that draws you so in. Everything counts when he writes. He doesn't do it to take up empty pages of a book but rather to fill the empty pages of our minds and imagination."
4,"A great novel, but not his best.","Terry Goodkind is probably one of the most talented writers in the field of fantasy today. He is not Robert Jordan, nor is he trying to be. Mr. Goodkind's stories are original and moving. I have read all of his books published so far and I'm eagerly awaiting his next one. Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, and I don't expect anyone to listen to my views about his books over anyone elses. I do however, hope that anyone thinking of reading the Sword of Truth novels to read them and make their own opinions. If you want a story that is new and original, Mr. Goodkind is a good writer to go to. His stories will reach into your heart and tickle your emotions unlike any other writer out there. I strongly suggest his novels."
4,"Very good, but...","This is a very good fantasy novel. I enjoy the ideas and the creative plot twists. If only he could cut out some of the excess, mundane dialogue, the author would really have something special. As it is, it is a novel that a fantasy addict can enjoy. The rest of the world, however, might wonder what all the fuss is about."
3,"Not bad, but disappointingly long-winded (on tape)","I greatly enjoyed reading the first 3 of the series, but was very disappointed at Temple of the Winds, listening to it during my commute. This was the first epic fantasy volume I've tried as an audiobook, and it just didn't work. It's easier to write long than write short, and I find myself listening to 20 minutes of long-winded prose or dialog that I would be able to skim through in a book. I don't know whether I would be more positive about it if I had READ the book instead. Give the tapes a miss. (I recently listened to a long series of tapes for a book of another genre, The Hunt for Red October, and was captivated -- I LOOKED FORWARD to commuting and listening to the tapes)."
4,good book- little to much lovin' goin' on though,"It is a good book. The war starts- a plague sweeps the land and people are forced to either join with the good guys or get blown away. Very good war fantasy book- it is not as good as Martin but still still good in its own wayYes there is to much kissing and love, but i really didn't mind that bad if terry would not go into so much detail- i didn't mind the torture detail in the second book but this was to muchbut i still think that this is a good book and worth reading"
2,Received damaged,I use these diskc for long distance drives and unfortunatly the box arrived damaged and disc one was cracked. Since I was away from home I was not able to return. Everything else purchased from Amazon has arrived without and issue. The new format of these audio books are much improvrd over the older mutiple disc sets
3,Why so much change in the cassette reading?,"(Applies to the cassette, not the book) What in the world is going on here? After 80 BLISSFUL hours of listening to the first two books on cassette while going to work, the world changed. There was no unabridged copy of the Blood of the Fold, so I had to find time to read it. Then I got ready for 30 more hours of pleasure listening to another Dick Hill interpretation of Book 4. To my UNPLEASANT surprise, Mr. Hill has changed all the pronuciations of the characters, towns, mountain ranges, you name it. This is extremely distracting. SHAME on whoever had this idea!!!! The worst is the new pronunciation of Kahlan. I'm certainly glad there is only one pronunciation of Richard, or that would probably have changed too."
5,Winds is the best of the series since the original,"Terry Goodkind just continues to get better as a writer. Temple of the Winds is a gripping tale of despair, lost love, betrayal and redemption. The main characters are the same as Richard Rahl, Kahlan, Zedd, Nathan Rahl, and the evil dreamwalker Emperor Jagang fight in this world and the underworld for posession of the Old and New Worlds. New to this tale is Richard's half-brother Drefan, also the offspring of the wicked Darken Rahl. The plot is similar to the other three books, but I found Temple to be particularly riveting. If you are a fan of the series, don't expect to get a good night's sleep for the few days it will take you to zip through the 525+ pages. There are a few chapters of brutality that some readers may find overpowering. Jagang's army is merciless. Now all we have to do is grudgingly wait for the fifth installment."
3,Noticeably worse than the first three books,"This book is where the series really moves down a notch. By this book, its nowhere near as good as the Wizards First Rule.After this it get MUCH worse. Do yourself a favor and stop reading..."
3,Temple of the Winds,"Having read the entire Sword of Truth series, and having enjoyed it, I can say this is my least favorite. I think if Richard grabbed Kahlan once more and dragged her into a corner to kiss her, yet again, I would have thrown the book across the room. The plot was engaging, the characters are some I have grown to care about, but the stolen kisses just got to be tiring, even for a romantic at heart such as I am."
3,A good read with a few faults,"This is definately a good read, but I cannot give it a higher score than this. One reason is the relationship between Richard and Kahlan. Yes, we know they love each other; how many damn times does Goodkind have to tell us? It is much too sappy for my taste. Also is Goodkind's heavy handed writing style. Several times I felt like Goodkind stopped trying to tell us a story, and instead was trying to indoctrine us into his philosophy. Forgiveness and healing; nobility of self sacrifice, etc... Yes, I know these themes have a place in the story, but Goodkind was so overbearing it felt like I was reading some dogma garbage. This book had potential but falls far short."
4,Temple of the Winds Unabridged Audiobook,"4th book in a good series. Not quite as good as the first 3, but still necessary listening. I have listened to all of the previous books on the on CD, and my only complaint is that I'm not as fond of this voice actor as I have been of the actors who have narrated the previous books."
2,Temple of the winds,This book was alittle long winded for book on cassete maybe it is not the type of book that transfers well to audio as some very well written books sometimes don't work well when they are made into audio
4,Deftones,"Hi, everyone. This one was pretty damn good. It wasn't as good as ""Wizard's First Rule"", but it was better than all the rest. I've read alot of the other reviews, and I find alot of them make light of Richard and Kahlan's relationship. I know for some of you that this just isn't your thing, romance and all that, but what really irks you about romance? But suffice it to say that the two best things in life are the deftones and terry's books. I wasn't dissapointed in this book, and I don't think that anything Kahlan or Richard did was corny. All the information given at the beginning of the book was not unecessary. The only thing really wrong with the book is we have seen betrayal before. Besides wondering how many times Richard or Zedd or Kahlan or Cara or Denna or Darken Rahl or Gratch or Giller or Nathan or Ann or Verna or Warren or Chandalen or Savidlin or the Birdman or anyone will ever be betrayed, this book is a pretty cool addition to the series."
1,"X-Rated ""Fantasy"" trash","Readers Beware: This is a sex-filled romp of a series. Mr. Goodkind's idea of a plot is the necessary space in between rape scenes and gettin' the characters good and naked. The writing is sophmoric, the characters are unbelivably shallow and the love (read sex) story between Richard and Kahlan is laughably ridiculous. To call this stuff soap-opera would be too great a compliment. To even waste the time to read one chapter is an unfortunate loss. This series belongs nowhere but the filth pile. If you want real fantasy read Jordan or Tad Williams. I can find nothing about this work that elevates it to be worthy of being printed. As a printed novel it belongs in the romance (once again read sex) section."
3,"Good read, but definitely lacking...","I did enjoy this book from start to finish, but it was lacking in many different ways. It may just be because I'm a 22 year old male college student, but I did get tired of hearing how much Kahlan LOVED Richard. They appeared to be more like lovestruck, suburban teenagers than two powerful mages enveloped in a terrible plague-infested war. Despite being around 600 pages (paperback), I finished the whole book and ended up feeling like I had just watched a single episode of some long running sit-com on the sci-fi channel. However, I do look forward to the inevitable confrontation between the Dreamwalker, Emperor Jagang, and Richard. There is a great story buried in there somewhere."
4,"EXCELLENT,","Goodkind is by far one of my favorite authors! I Think that it is time that Richard moves on with his talents, unlike David Eddings series The Belgariad and The Mallorean Richard doe not progress in his talents he just gets lucky. he is all so powerful byut learns nothing from his adventures. Stiil An Awsome emotional mind grabbing book That I would recomend to anyone."
1,"Not a Very Good Book, 1/2 star at Best","I thought that ""Wizard's First Rule"" was an instant classic along with the other two previous books in the series. Unfortunately, this book is sorely lacking in anything remotely resembling a plot. Goodkind wrote the first half of the book with Kahlan and Cara arguing about who wanted to protect Richard more! It was ridiculous. Also, Richard was an extremely interesting and even remarkable character in the first three books, but in ""Temple,"" Richard is annoying at best. Zedd and Nathan, argueably teh two most interesting characters in this book are completely forgotten at times. Throwing Darken Rahl back into the series was just stupid because we have seen enough of him. Jagang is not very frightening. The whole book is about getting into a temple in which we don't see anything interesting happen, and stopping a plague. This book is a waste of time."
4,Will Richard EVER develop his talents? (Mild spoilers),"An excellent fantasy story although I didn't think it was as good as the previous three. My primary objection is that Richard, Kahlan et. al are perpetually behind the eight ball. The last two books seem obsessed with telling us how powerful Richard is, but he has learned almost nothing about his abilities. The heroism through ignorance theme is starting to wear a little thin. It would be something if Richard was learning more about his abilities as time went by, but the only thing Richard seems to be able to do is ""pull the rabbit out of the hat"" but only when he has absolutely no other choice. Despite this it is still very fun to read."
1,Part of the same series?,"Enough with the incessant need to have ridiculous reasons to keep Richard and Kahlan apart/back together. PICK 1 already. This last book really was over the top with irrational behavior, melodramatic drivel, predictable ""twists"" and times just stupid plot advancements. I enjoyed the first 2 books and the 3rd was ok, but cant understand how this book is even considered part of the same series. It feels like the author just woke up one morning and decided that book 4 should be wrote in one day. Very little thought for long term advancement of the story was put into this book."
3,Non-compatible with I-tunes,"I had been reading the Terry Goodkind book series by downloading via I-tunes to my phone. For some reason, I-tunes didn't have book four. No problem Amazon had it and I recieved the shipment right away, Unfortunately, I am apparently not tech savy enough to figure out how to get it to download and play on my phone. I am sure it is a great book because I decided I would just have to skip this book and go on to the next in the series and I have enjoyed them all. I would recommend the series to anyone who enjoys a little magic, love and struggle. I just hope you have better luck accessing the whole series."
5,Awesome book,This is one of the best books that Terry Goodkind has ever wrote I love the Sword of Truth Series
3,The sword visits another plane of existance,"This novel contains key information upon which other novels in this series refer. It is a must read.Terry has a tendency to really get into exposition. It becomes page after page of exposition, most of which one can scan. Without the scanning, the book has a tendency to become ploddingly slow.Here, our hero must save humankind from illness that is killing thousands. He is forced to visit the temple of the winds to effect a cure. This becomes dangerous as he must overcome obsticles and meet his dad. Kahlan must make a choice that has terrible consequences.One could thumbnail the book in several paragraphs .. slow"
3,Terry Goodkind needs to get his mind out of the gutter,"This was an OK book. The plot needed some help, but it moved along fairly well. The biggest problem with it was the whole sex thing getting into the temple of the winds. It was completely un-necessary. It seems to have been put in there just to attract the people who want lots of sex in the books they read. It should not have been in there. The first time Richard thought that Kahlan betrayed him, in book 2, made sense. But this whole sex scheme in book 4 was just gross. TG really needs to get his mind out of the gutter. It's a good book, with an OK plot, but the sex was not needed. Hopefully future installments leave that kind of trash out. However, at least Kahlan and Richard finally got married. That should have happened back in book 2. A decent read, but not as good as the previous installments."
1,Excessive violence against women-Avoid!!!!,"I liked his first books, but the excessive violence against women has got to stop. The fact that many readers find this acceptable is scary. I put it down unfinished. I think it is sadistic pornography. I would not let my adolescent daughter or son read this book. JR.Tolkein created high fantasy without S&M and graphic rapes. We readers must have some values for our world. I won't buy another of his books, and I will write to the publisher and even Mr. Goodkind. As a rape survivor, I want fantasy to take me good places not my nightmares."
2,What a slog!,"This will be the last book of this series that I read. Poor pacing, nonsensical plot developments and vile 'torture porn' scenes ruined this book for me."
1,Hi. I'm Temple of the Winds and I'm a...uh....good book.,"When I read a book, I generally like it to be good. This is not what I like to call a good book. It was boring, and there were just a few similarities to ROBERT JORDAN here and there. There was no point to completely devoting a chapter to Drefan raping and attacking a prostitute. What was the point? It could have been written quickly, but still incorporated. Some people may argue and say that this is a good book. Those people like to lie to and decieve you. They are after your souls. The book was horrible. You really wanna fight about it? Email me. (I made my address after reading the first-and only good-book in the series)"
2,Long and pointless,"This book is a serious decline for the series. The first half revloves entirely around boring, repetitve and dry dialouge. It very much feels as if an editor should have been more involved. While the book has a fairly intersting plot line it is scattered, drawn out and poorly executed. Kalhan and Richard seem to be looseing charecter depth as the books progress, their interaction is cliche and overdramatic,more than anything this book seems to be lacking purpose."
3,A well-written book that wallows far too much in sadism.,"Mr. Goodkind is an excellent writer. He is able to put together an engrossing story in this book as well as in the others of the series I have read. I enjoy his work, but have grown very tired of the sadistic sexual encounters that seem to be thrown in to simulate interest. If we hadn't seen similar scenes in previous books in the series, we might think the sadist in this particular book was unique and therefore the gratuitous violence perhaps justified. However, the universe described by Mr. Goodkind appears to have a rather high preponderance of nasty sorts who only seem to be able to get sexual gratification from the fear and pain of their victims. Perhaps Mr. Goodkind should introduce some competent psychotherapists to deal with this national problem. I would love to read a Goodkind book that can develop new themes rather than rely on tired, over-used sensationalism. He has the writing talent to transcend the cheap attention getter."
2,Just Could Not Finish It,"I read the first three novels in the series and they were entertaining. But, I just could not get through this book and about halfway through I put it down to read something else. Will I ever finish it? Probably not. I just do not care about the neverending soap opera of Richard and his friends anymore. Maybe you can finish it, others surely like it, but I think at least for the foreseeable future I am done with the series."
1,No comparison to the first 3 novels,"I have to admit to the minority of those people, who said Goodkind writes great fantasy, but only in the first three novels. Temple of the Winds is a very boring thing. The lovestory of Richard and Khalan gets finally to a happy and, on the last 20 pages, but before. It's terrible, some hundred sides of ""I love you, I never will leave you, blablabla.."", then the great betrayel we know from the other books. And last but not least, a hideous sentence how the next book will be (the three greeting formulas, very suspicious). I think, if Mr. Goddkind thinks more about the plot like learning Richard his magic and the good intentions he have shown us in the first two parts, and a little bit lower in the third one, I hope I can buy book number 5 in order to read good fantasy again. It's very sad, because I know from the first books that you can write good stuff, so please, don't write only for making a lot of money with blowing up old, driven out pathways."
3,"A good read, but there's something missing.","I was immediately captured by the first two books of Goodkind's the Sword of Truth series. Yet the latter books missed that something that makes a book a great read. His characters gradually developed into established figures, one of the powerful wizard and his beautiful lady. Although their determination to stay together even though it seemed impossible is mildly entertaining, it is not enough to ensnare the reader to pore over the pages just once more. Books three and four showed little character development, if any. The ending was also a tad disappointing, leaving the reader with many unanswered questions as to what happened to other characters in the novel."
3,Well-written but took too long to get to the main story.,"This is a very good novel by Mr. Goodkind. However, the majority of the story was just information and discussion. Aside from some quick action at the start and near the end (when Richard went into the Temple of the Winds), there's nothing much. It needs more action. I have read the series in order and loved everyone of them (including this one) but TOW lacks action. But I still look forward to reading the next book in the series."
2,A big step in the wrong direction...,"I greatly enjoyed the first three books in this series, but after about 250 pages or so I'm having a tough time bringing myself to continue reading ""Temple of the Winds."" The characters seem much more one dimensional than I remember - at times I wonder if a computer wrote the dialog using stock phrases and a simple rule base. Nadine seems a pointless, annoying character and Drefan an obvious bad guy. Why Richard and Kahlan tolerate them irks the heck out of me. I'm going to continue to plod through the novel, holding out hope that it improves. If it does I'll revise this review."
3,What happened to the story???,"The first 3 books of this series were wonderful. His characters and concepts were imaginative. His monsters were scary and his villains evil. For awhile it looked like this was going to be on of the classic fantasy series, but then book four...... What the $@#% was that about. Dream Walker cool idea but really lame implementation. Am I the only one or did he get side tracked much like ""Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and the last two ""Highlander's."" Well in short if you haven't red the first 3 do so, they are great."
3,Good but not as good as the last ones,Good book but not as good as first 3.... To much trash about what happened in last 3 books and too much explanation who is who. Beginning was boring because of this. Middle and the end were great. Give us more action and less explanation about what happened in books before.
4,Wait for the Paperback,"Well, although I did read the book in one sitting, I do think that there are definite flaws in this book, and in the series as a whole. How many times do we have to see Kahlan betray Richard, but, it all turns out to have been necessary? It's getting repetitive folks! Plus, what with the Sisters of the Light, the fall of the Prelate, who is *supposed* to be dead, but instead, is off trying to twist the world to fit the prophecy, I just keep getting flashbacks of Aie Sedai in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Actually, if you look at the whole series, there seem to be *many* essential plot elements that have been *borrowed* by Mr. Goodkind from Mr. Jordan's (IMHO) FAR better written series. Check out the real thing folks - Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. Then read this series to laugh at the stolen concepts."
4,Fantastic Book!,I have enjoyed reading this great series and thought this book was fantastic and a real page turner and recommend it to anyone who likes this type of story.
3,Good but....,A good book. Author repeats things and re-explains things over and over throughout the series. I'm currently reading the next one in the series and am very close to putting it down because of the repetitiveness.
4,Great Story..,"Another great book from Terry Goodkind. Once again I was held spellbound in the world of Richard and Kahlan not putting the book down for hours. But one thing started to annoy me, Terry seems to repeat past events over and over which I guess makes it so a reader who has not read the first three books will still enjoy Temple Of The Winds seperately, but for those of us who have it gets boring. As I start the 5th book I just hope he repeats himself less..."
3,The Shine is Starting to Fade,"This book was the weakest in the series so far. It had a number of problems: too much time was invested in building the suspence; way to sappy, the romantic dialog was trite; Richard didn't use his power nearly enough. But, all things considered, Mr. Goodkind has skills. He still manages to deliver a decent story."
4,Stop whining......,"This is another great book in the series. Although not as great as Stone of Tears, but definitely a great addition to the series. As with the previous books the twists in the plot are unpredictable and very interesting. I have stayed up for hours reading these books, and were well worth the loss in sleep..."
4,Good series,I am enjoying the whole series. Terry seems to be a little long windedbut thats one of the joys of the book.
5,BeWizarded(beWitched) and ask for more!,"Which book would you take with you to a desert Island? The question is which book would inspire you to find a desert island so you may read uninterrupted? Temple of the Winds, of COURSE! I have been scheduling vacation time since I found out Richard and his beloved Kalhan were coming back on October 1st. Terry Goodkind's words are pure magic. From the first spell, this Wizard of the First Order entices you to a colorful world of his own. Richard, Kalhan and Zedd are so vibrantly human, and passionate and so desperately fighting to make the world a better place. They leap out of the pages and grab your guts, and call you to come along, and fight and weep and laugh, and hug, long after the finishing spell. Forget about the desert island! I am taking Richard, Kalhan and Zedd with me!"
2,Wanderlust,The series lost me with this book. It is just meandering on and on without direction. It has become a fantasy soap opera without interesting characters to sustain it. I wish a lot of these fantasy writers would know when to stop. they come up with a good idea at the begining and then just want to wring the idea to death.
2,not as good as the first two,Goodkind starts losing his touch. The plot is great but the story behind it is not. Goodkind focuses his mind on too much political issues and it moves the book very slow. I wasn't nearly as enthusiastic about reading this one as I was the previous ones. Bottom line: not that great.
5,Best in the series!,"Goodkind has a knack for writing off on a tangent, especially when you really want to know what happens to a particular storyline. I'd have to say books #5 and #7 in this series are a little disappointing for that very reason. This book, on the other hand, is by far the best in the series! It's full of action and excitement that can be quite lacking at times in some of the other books. You'll never want to put this book down!"
1,a very sadistic book,"I had read the first 3 books and though I enjoyed them, there was always something bothering me about them. And I finally put my finger on it: Sadism. This author is very sadistic. His books are filled with scenes about the abuse of little children and endless rape and torture scenes. Drefan for example is a copy and paste of Jack the Ripper. This is not a very ""good"" nor ""kind"" book."
1,I should simply cut and paste the same review,"for the first three books, because in my mind, they were the same--why should my review be any different.Dull. Boring. Ponderous. Tedious. Contrived. Overdone. Simple. Derivative. Should I go on? I know, you Goodkind sychophants and apologists out there will now read this review and give it the old unhelpful label. Ha, that should teach me not to review horrid books involving some of the worst developed and contrived characters I've had the displeasure of getting to know.Here's a tip: Go to your library and check out George R.R. Martin, or Stephen Erikkson, or Robin Hobb, or David Coe, or John Marco, or LWE, and read those author's books and then decide who writes good fantasy. Until you do, keep reading the sword of truth series and the Shannara series to complete your overrated author sweep"
1,Sick puppy,"I read the first 3 books in the series and found them a little derivative of LOTR and the Wheel of Time series, but he has a flair for quickly paced, exciting endings. While this book has all of the above pluses and minuses, it also introduces some of the sickest torture scenes I have ever read in science fiction. Yes, there is a love of minutely described gore in all the previous books, but this book hit a new low. I refuse to read another of his books. I do not recommend this book to women at all, because the torture is misogynist, sickly sexual and gratuitous. I don't recommend it to men on the same basis, but if you read this and enjoy it, you too are a sick puppy."
4,Great Read!!,"An on-going great story with a large cast of believable characters. Mr. Goodkind tends to ramble a bit, but I am an impatient reader and want to get and stay at the heart of the story. This is an easy four star book."
5,This is a great series.,"Goodkinds SOT series is the best I have ever read. It has all the elements of a fantastic story, all brought together to run smoothly along at a fairly good speed. A lot of people seem to disagree with his seeming overuse of rape and sex in his books, but I feel that he is simply using one of our most raw, basic emotions to stir deep, strong feelings in us all. We can all agree that rape is a terrifying thing. It stirs feelings of insecurity and fear. It is the demented, sexually perverse people that we find easy to hate and fear. I also feel he is perfectly developing his characters in a way that allows the reader to grow WITH them, and learn as they learn, and almost feel what they feel. Keep it up, Terry! I'm eagerly awaiting book #5!"
2,Better if you pretend Goodkind didn't write this.,"WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS:Only extremely fervent fans of Mr. Goodkind should read this book. We mean the kind of fans that have somehow misconstrued earlier works as important in their lives. And these stalwarts only if they can stand some truly sadistic stuff. Although the novel is self-contained, there is absolutely no reason to read this book without having read the first three.WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:If you didn't like where Blood of the Fold was going as far as sex and violence (or lack of plot development), stop. End your acquisition of Truth novels. Certainly if you're squeamish about sexual torture, do not read this book. This is a pretty good example of what happens to a pretty decent series when it gets drunk on its own success.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"
5,Mordsith,"Terry Goodkind writes so well that you feel for the characters. My favourite characters are (apart from the main ones, ie. Richard, Kahlan, Zedd) Gratch (Book 2) and the Mordsith. The Mordsith make me laugh at their teasing of Richard and their discovery of life. It also actually made me cry when Raina feed the chipmunks before she took her last breath. Very heartrenching.Well written to bring out all the different types of emotion.Love the series"
4,A bit repetitive but suprising and accurate enough,"The plot of this book is somehow annoying - take, for example, the troublesome events that always prevents Kahlan and Richard's marriage - but still you can't hold it down.the betrayal of the one in white blew my mind away! wasn't expecting that part and loved it!but the thing is, Goodkind is very repetitive during the descriptions, especially when describing Richard's looks and Kahlan. Also, he is explaining the events in the former books and that could be boring sometimes.. maybe thats because I read the books without giving a break, one by one... still, I beleive there is no need for such reminders.Overall, the series is great and I loved this book."
4,truly great,"the adventure just doesn't end, will these two ever have true peace, at least they put adventure in my life!!!very fun, you better read this book!!"
5,Excellent,"Temple of the Winds continues the stellar writing and story line that has been put out in the Sword of Truth Series. It was nice to finally see Richard and Khalan finallly get married. I also like how he puts out a rule in each of the books dealing with human nature. When you apply those rules to everyday societies you relize just how true they really are. Take a look at how popular tabloids are today, people will belive what they want to belive. I read the book in about a day and a half I couldnt put it down, and for the past year I have been waiting for the fifth book in the series. As always Richard kicks butt and Kahlan is as regal as and yet down to earth as she has been in the other books. I also liked the dialogs between Zed and Analina they are always amusing. All in all this was a stellar book, carrying on the richness and fullness that I have come to expect in The Sword of Truth Series. If TG keeps writing them I will keep buying them Bravo Zulu Terry keep up the fine work"
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"Terry Goodkind has outdone his-self with this series. I was getting tired of the hohum fantasy and stumbled on these books, I am still waiting for more. Zedd is the greatest, serious but comical, very lovable. The Mord-Sith are brave and give readers intense action and a chance to learn together. Finally Richard and Kahlan go together. Thier fight for humanity and true love is a lesson in itself."
3,"Better, but still not as good as the 1st one.","I thought this was alot better in comparison to the 3rd book, but If it wasn't for WFR I would not continue reading TG, I find with the first 2 books it was more origanal and exciting. I feel that he has started to loose the originalty to the world he has created."
3,What is happening?,"Let me just say, that I was a big fan of Goodkind. I loved the earlier books, BUT, this Temple of the Winds is absolutely horrible. First of all, it is extremely repititous to everything else he has written, and without giving any spoilers, remember ""Love will conquer all evils!!"" Two things that frustrate the heck out of me: 1. Kahlan is supposed to be one of the most powerful, well respected, important persons, in all the lands. However, she never has a clue of what she is doing, shes always crying, she is a complete puppet, easily manipulated, and is spineless. Her charecter has become the most annoying part of the series. 2. Although many people do not want to admit it, Goodkinds similarities to the Wheel of Time is very uncanny. It is WAY too coincidental, and I find it rather insulting.In conclusion, although this series started off with a bang, I would suggest that you do not bother to read any further. Find another series to read.-Kinslayer"
5,"Great Book, but Richard needs a rest!!!!!","I think this book was great. The plot was involving and characters were vibrant and lifelike, just as in the earlier books. However, I think Richard needs a rest or pause between adventures. He hasn't had more than a couple days of freedom without some evil villain or plot to worry about since the beginning of the series."
2,"Painful, as an audiobook","I managed to finish the audiocasettes of this book as I commuted, but only just.I loved the first couple books in this series, but the magic's gone.I've listened to several other books on audiocasette as I drive, and found them fine -- so the fault is with this book. The long-winded prose was painful to listen to; I finally had to give up on this book (a first), not too far from the end.In this case only, this audiobook would have been better abridged."
4,"Terry, fire your editor.","Please stop rehashing the story with every book. It is not necessary. If there are those who did not read the first few they should go out and buy them. For those of us who did take the time and read them, we don't need it retold over and over. Great book anyhow. I would read it again and skip over the rehash."
5,I was up past my bedtime reading this one,This is a great continuation of what Goodkind started in Wizards First Rule. This book goes into the depresion of losing the person you love most and having to sacrifice so much to have them back.
3,An eclectic mess.,"This book was a useless waste for the first 300 pages (hardbound). The story didn't progress at all, the textual formatting (and especially Goodkind's annoying use of extraneous paragraph breaks in spoken text) was distracting and the dialogue was transparent and often redundant. From there, however, the story takes off into the satisfying, action-heavy problem-solving/confrontations that make the first three books so addictive. Strangely, the dialogue followed suit - I'm not sure why. The contrast between the first and second halves of the book is so startling that it's almost like the first part was written by someone else. So be warned: the majority of the book is NOT up to par with the last three."
4,A wonderfullly written captivating novel,This book lives up to Terry Goodkinds previous novels. It was a captivating novel that was difficult to put down until the end. The only negative criticism was the ending. It seemed rushed and came together too quickly. There were some unexpected twists at the end however all in all it was an excellent book.
3,Not TOO shabby,"Not bad...Not as good as I was hoping. I'm starting to see the trend going on here. Goodkind is extremely talented! But his type of story seems like the same thing over and over! WFR was very good with interesting characters and a good story. Then so was SoT but only slightly less because of boring scenes. Then BotF dropped way down but was still a really good but with less interesting villains more boring parts and and those annoying sexual scenes that drives the nerves crazy! Make it a story not a porno. There is some things about the characters you really don't want to know about like ALL their pleasures! And please Terry try to come up with a origional story and please can we advance the story more with all those pages?Still I really like Goodkind he makes books of the ""good kinds"" I love his works anyway I just wanted him to use his talents for their best. And I think he can still do better, just give him a chance!"
1,Eww... the fifth book better improve,"I first was addicted to Terry good kind with his first 3 books. But this book was a total disappointment. It had no plot advancement, and suffice to say, the cover art was the only thing good in the whole book. Not that I really care, but it is strange that as soon as Robert Jordan gets into a writer's block, Terry Goodkind starts writing plotless books. Hmmmm..."
5,Temple of the Winds,"All I can say to those of you who opposed to this book is this: Fantasy is reality set on another plane of existance. Get over yourselves. If you think it was that bad,YOU write a bestselling book. I haven't had the pleasure of reading this masterpiece yet, but I've been waiting anxiously for a long time and I can't wait."
2,Same old thing,"Well once again I told myself that the next book of Goodkind's would capture the magic of his forst book. Once again I was wrong. In yet another installment of Richard and Kahlan getting torn apart and then reunited against all odds, Goodkind thrashes what has become a rather dead horse. In achieving this glorious finale for our protagonists, Goodkind also explores some rather disturbing aspects of fantasy that should be left between him and his therapist. Either that or hs has been indulging in the game of shock-tactics. And that too I find disturbing. It seems that graphic sexual content is how Goodkind makes up for his lack of plot or characterization. Pain and pleasure seem to be the common theme involved in all of the books in this series but in this last one I feel he has gone too far. My advice? At least wait till it comes out in ppbk or go to your local library. Even with the great prices at this place it is not worth it!"
5,Review of Temple of the Winds,Terry Goodkind continues to reinforce my belief that he is truly one of the greatest fantasy writers of all time. I found Temple of the Winds to be even more exciting than the first three installments in this great series.
3,subpar,This was a struggle for me to get thru at points in the book. All the sappy love crap between Richard and Kahlan Went too far and for too long. Thank goodness for emporer Jagang and Nathan. They were the high points in this one. This was my least favorite so far.
2,More of same,"OK, so Goodkind understands he has a franchise and is going to milk it for whatever it's worth. There is enough life in this series to keep me reading found or borrowed copies though I certainly wouldn't buy it. The characters are relatively engaging and flawed though of course oh-so-heroic. The world gets saved every single time--there's no pretense of an actual arcing story here, every single doorstop-sized volume brings the characters and their entire world to (and beyond) the brink of utter failure before (somewhat cleverly) pulling all the chestnuts out of the fire. Goodkind's weird obsessions with S&M are considerably less evident here, and in fact the odd warrior/bodyguard/dominatrices are curiously endearing in this volume. And the 850 odd pages do whiz by."
2,"Excellent story, troublesome plot devices","I was very much taken in by the first three books of this series -- I enjoyed the development of Richard and Kahlan, and the ways Goodkind used the Boundary, revealed Zedd's abilities, and so forth.In this book, the details of what Drefan does made me ill. I am concerned for Goodkind that he was even able to conceive of such crimes, never mind describe them in detail. I think he is a very troubled man.I will wait a while before I buy book five in the series."
1,Reggie the Chipmunk strikes again,"Wow! A whole world peopled with characters with the maturity and motives of college kids, and disturbed ones at that - though at least his women don't sniff all the time! I thought it couldn't get sillier until Reggie the chipmunk showed up. This man can write a good story; whose time is he wasting?"
1,A bad joke,"If you liked the first three in this series, don't think for a moment you will like this one. If you didn't like the first three, this one you will hate. Basically, having written three books, the author decided to take a break in this one and write sheer and utter nonsense. The first 100 pages is a complete joke, inane conversation abound, written as if by a high school child. Worst of all, it's unbelievable BORING. It's as if he's paid by the word and he just sat down and started rambling. Page after page of childish, boring conversation between the characters. It's UNREADABLE. I cannot believe the editors let this be published as is, shame on them."
2,WHAT THE ?,"I would like to start out by saying that my beef is with Brilliance Audio and Dick Hill and not with Terry Goodkind. I have purchased all of the preceding books on audio cd and listen to them on the way to and from work everyday. I have read the whole series as well. When I first started listening to this cd, I couldn't figure out who Kylin was. I finally released it was Dick Hills version of how to pronounce Kalan's name. This my be trivial to some people but it really annoys the crapp out of me. I would think that someone would of picked up on the fact that the pronunciation of a main character's name was completely different in this version."
4,blah blah blah with a twist,"I have to give Terry credit for the sheer fact that his books are hard to put down. I just wish he wouldn't insult the reader by assuming we haven't paid any attention to the previous installments. He is constantly devoting page after page redescribing what he has already taken page after page to describe in the first place. I think the story is good, perhaps a little to sexual for my taste, but still good. in all honesty, I am mostly reading the book because I am eagerly awaiting the release of Robert Jordan's next book in the Wheel of Time series, which I have read about three times now. So be wary of these books as you may be lost in the repetitiveness, but if you can get past that, you may enjoy the read, somewhat. Write me if you agree or disagree with me, I would love to hear your insight."
3,Dick Hill must have amnesia...,"What in the world is going on here? To my UNPLEASANT surprise, Mr. Hill has changed all the pronuciations of the characters, towns, mountain ranges, you name it. This is extremely distracting. The worst is the new pronunciation of Kahlan. Even Buck Schirner maintained the original pronunciations in Blood of the Fold."
2,Could have been shorter without the summary,"This book prabably could have been a couple hundred pages shorter if it weren't for the fact that every other page was a review of what happened in the previous books. Don't get me wrong - it's great that Goodkind tries to explain what has happened in the event of new readers, but the way he does it is unsubtle and tedious. Otherwise, I liked the book, but when you skip almsot entire chapters because they are nothing but one character telling a new character what you've already read, something is not quite right."
1,Is this a porno or a fantasy?,"I enjoyed the series up to this book but after reading this, I was very upset. I was upset with the sexuality in this book. Calm it down Terry, this is being read by kids. I won't read another book of yours."
2,Awful,"Drivel. Like a soap opera set in the middle ages, Temple of Winds tells the story of Richard's love for Kahlan, and Kahlan's love for Richard. And on and on we go, with all the written appeal of a dimestore romance novel. Goodkind can't even bring himself to describe parts of the body - referring to a vagina as ""her sex"". It appears as if Goodkind's story - which started wonderfully well - is petering out. Avoid at all costs."
2,Somehow it disappointed me.,"This has not been my first series regarding lost and ancient worlds. Ages ago I was introduced into these types of books by the magic hand of JRR Tolkien; since then I have found authors that even could match him in inventing gripping stories. I'm talking about Tad Williams, for instance. When I read the two first parts of SOT, without no doubt I'd have included Goodkind atop my selected ranking. However books III and IV lose that strange bait that attract the reader, sometimes you even get bored reading them or what is worse: you know what is going to happen next. I was really fed up with Khalan and Richard's pasionate demostrations of love. Jezz! Goodkind spends more that a half of the Temple of Winds writing about if they kiss each other in the first step of a stair or behind a corner. I thought it was going to be much more fluent and interesting."
1,This book bites,"Call me sick (and many have), but I don't mind the sex or violence. What I do mind is authors adding unnecissary filler to stories. I loved the first book. It was a full, wonderful novel. The rest of them (2-4) are short stories filled with extra dialogue. Many of the chapters are elongated with redundancy simply becuase this writer thinks he needs to write a 500 page novel.And who else but me could give a hoot about Richard and Kahlan? Okay the love each other. That was established in the first novel. Now, it's just plain sappy. Each would give their lives for the other. (How many times was that crud said?) Their whole love affair with each other is just corny beyond belief. If I wanted this kind of dung I would have read a Hallmark card. I will not be buying any further installments of this series"
2,"Goodkind is the best, but this is his worst.","Terry Goodkind is probably my favorite fiction author of all time, right next to R. A. Salvatore. This, however, is the worst book of the ""Sword of Truth"" series. It's all talk and no action. I recommend skipping it and heading straight to ""Soul of the Fire"". That one's much better."
4,Continuing the Story,"If you have gotten this far in the ""Sword of Truth"" series, you are committed to following the story of Richard and Kahlan to the end. Do not fear - Temple of the Wind is just as gripping as the previous novels. The widening cast of characters, especially the bad guys, keeps the series fresh and exciting. Sister of the Light Verna is given more depth and humanity, and we learn more about Nathan, the prophet. Goodkind is superb in his character development and we suffer the pains and celebrate the victories of all of them he's brought to life in these books."
2,Can't Richard and Kahlan catch a break??,"Well this book didn't have the ending I had hoped for, but that aside... It was well written. Here's my thing though... Richard and Kahlan are constantly getting screwed in these novels, and it's always somehow their fault! It's depressing and tiresome. By the fourth novel you would think that Richard and Kahlan could battle something that wasn't going to destroy their lives and everyone around them. It's always a no-win situation. If I was Richard I'd be like ""F-it!""And I can't continue the series, because the NEXT novel is about how they screwed up YET AGAIN, and unlocked some spell by getting married. I mean they're such benevolent characters it makes you want to puke or pull your hair out, and they still get jacked no matter what they do! Come up with something NEW! sheesh!"
5,"It is, and will become, an all-time classic.","I bought the first book in the series at the Orlando Airport to pass the time because of a lay-over. I've always liked fantasy, and it didn't look to bad. After I got done with it, I immediately went out and bought the next one and so on. After I finished Temple of the Winds, I was angry because it was the last book in the series. I'd give it ten stars if I could. It never faltered in the plot and it always left you wanting more. Always wondering what will happen next. An excellant series and hopefully this book will just be another stepping stone in a great sreies."
2,Change something,"I don't want to sound too negative, but I liked only last 100 pages. The purpose of the first 500 pages were to refresh our memory of the previous 3 books. I don't think that was enought."
4,"oh come on, it wasn't as bad as you say, people","The book did not match up to the standards of his others, he over used the sexual violence and the Richard Kahlan thing was just too much. But overall the book wasn't that bad and I will recomand the series to my friends. And for those who say you aren't gonna read the 5th book, think about what you might be missing, Kahlan and Richard are married now, so I doubt Goodkind will take their relationship too much farther, and maybe Richard does have a relative that isn't sick in the mind (remember Drefan mentioning their sister Lili?)And what about Nathan and Warren, they're neat characters, what's gonna happen to them? Now that he knows the reader's opinion (probaly) he might not use as much violence and sex. think about it..."
5,Gable and Harlow electrify the screen,"""Red Dust"" is a classic early 1930's drama filled with plenty of steamy sexual tension and barbed dialogue that would never have got by the censors later in that decade. The film at first glance really doesn't look like a typical MGM product what with its depiction of a seemy side of life not commonly associated with Metro products. Indeed it has an almost modern feel to some of the exchanges between the leading players and the situations it depicts...I strongly recommend ""Red Dust"" to you as a terrific tale of lust and passion,... pre code style. It is first and foremost an unforgettable Gable/Harlow teaming where you get to see the types of characters for which both are best known vividly acted out. Both made great films with other perfomers in the future but to see first hand what made the Gable/Harlow combination such magic on screen you need go no further than the classic ""Red Dust""."
4,"The Original ""Mogambo""","""Red Dust"" proved such a success for Clark Gable that he starred in the remake ""Mogambo"" over twenty years later, in the very same role. That doesn't happen very often, you know! He's a man's man, all hard liquor and sweat, and he takes a liking, naturally enough, to the floozy who drifts onto his rubber plantation, Jean Harlow. Things are pretty cozy for them until the Upper Crust couple arrive, naive Gene Raymond and his prim and proper wife Mary Astor. Then Gable takes a liking to HER, and the fur flies with Harlow. ""Red Dust"" is a barrel of fun that ought to interest even the most casual of viewers==just check out that impassioned kissing of Mary Astor!"
5,Blissful combo of great stars! LOVED IT!,Loved this movie - Clark Gable literally smolders! Exotic locale and gorgeous starlets - what more could old movie fans want? Cant wait for this to come out on DVD!!!
4,Sexy pre-code drama has MGM stars glowing.,"Hot, muggy, sultry....and that just describes the stars, let alone the jungle setting. Harlow pines and poses for Gable while he chases his surveyor's wife (Mary Astor). This one is for the grown-ups or at least teenagers. Gable is a carefree bachelor on a rubber plantation when the local fluzzy, Harlow, shows up in distress. He invites her in for comfort and whatever else. When the city folks arive for a work contract, Gable has eyes only for the man's wife. We get a nasty triangle going with the best surprise ending you may have ever seen. I'm startled by it every time. Highly recommended."
4,The Original and the Best,"This movie was remade in the 50's as Mogambo, also starring Clark Gable. This version is much better. Set in an Asian rubber plantation, Gable is the owner who falls for the new foreman's wife (Mary Astor). Also present is a prostitute (Jean Harlow) who is in love with Gable's character. Trouble ensues when the foreman discovers what's going on, and Gable has to decide between the two girls. Good fun."
4,A trip to old Saigon.,"While the film is a bit dated, set in an era which nobody actually remembers (pre-WW2 Indochina and the rubber trade) the story is carried by the interaction between the two stars, Gable and Harlow in their primes."
2,Disappointed in Drew,"After reading the other books of The Cowboys, I was very disappointed in Drew. I had to force myself to finish the book. I could not relate to the characters and never felt anything stronger than annoyance with them. Not one of the best books by Leigh Greenwood."
3,Not a TOTAL waste of time...,"The only reason this book doesn't get a lower rating than 3 is the hero, Cole. He was lovely. He made the story worth reading. Drew was annoying, constantly threatening to shoot people. It was as if she didn't know how to do anything else. It got irritating after the first couple of times. It seemed highly unlikely that a man like Cole would fall for her...but, hey, weirder things have happened, right?...Nothing comes to mind right off the bat but I'm sure there's something...Anyway, there wasn't enough dialogue and too much thinking on Drew's part, who, incidentally, accused Cole of thinking too much...go figure. :) There were some amusing parts, though, so the book really wasn't a total waste of time.This story contains graphic love scenes."
4,A good look back at New Order's past...,"RETRO, a long time in the making, is a four disc box set providing a wide view of the twenty year-strong history of one of Britain's most unique groups.Split into four 'topical' discs, RETRO brings together hits, misses, remixes (some of which are rare or new) and a disc of live tracks (take your pick, as New Order are either wonderful or disastrous as a live unit). I didn't get the fifth disc, but if you're one of the lucky souls who does, it features nine incredible selections including the live take of ""The Perfect Kiss"" used in the promo film.I've seen a lot of bad reviews for this box set, but I personally see this as not only a great collection for a New Order fan who wants to hear some of those classic records remastered but also for someone who wants a place to start that covers NO's entire career. RETRO does both quite well."
3,Really Kinda Pointless for a Boxed Set,"What was the point here...? Let's have a boxset because New order deserves it, I guess. Sure there are plenty of classic tracks but... It's like setting your iPod to shuffle, it's not really the ""best of New Order's career"" and it is not really all that interesting for long time fans. It doesn't really make a statement about New order's career. The tracks have not really been remastered as far as I can tell. The live tracks are nice if a mixed bag, many tracks post prime for the band. The booklet is nice if not really essential. The boxset is just a boxset to be a boxset, just to have one. Really kinda pointless. It's a shame the band didn't have much interest in their history, but I guess it is kinda punk to just do a pisstake."
3,Boxed up!,"This boxset is exorbitantly costly as with most others. It is a MUST for new fans who don't own many of their old albums and previous hits collections. However, it's a great letdown for fans. Since 1987, there have beeen not less than three compilations fron New Order. Substance, Best of and Rest of were international releases and kjust last year, a sad collection of 14 songs from 1981-2002 called International. All of them are just a rehash of one another with the staples being covered in all. The only thing of relish her are the remixes and even then, most of the rare remixes unavailable commercially anymore are absent. The live CD as mentioned earlier, suffers from low-fi quality. The dream boxset is one with 12"" and rare remixes, rare B-sides, unreleased cuts and newly commissioned remixes. Till then, dream on. This is the best we will GET."
3,Who was the target audience?,"New Order is one of the all time great bands - intellegent, original, and just downright cool. However this box set seems to have no real purpose. Only real fans will shell out the $50 bucks, but the diehards will have almost all the material already. I've been following NO/JD for over 20 years and anticipated rare unreleased tracks and new mixes. Instead most of the set is already in my (and probably everyone elses) collection. OK, the live CD is new and a couple of the mixes aren't elsewhere available, but the rest is Substance with a few of their more recent releases added on. I expected more from them."
3,Isn't this recycled?,"Like most hardcore NO fans, I have most of the tracks in Retro, but I still bought the darn thing. ... For me, the fifth disk is probably the most interesting with more rarities than the other four disks. You get the original version of Elegia, the video mix of the Perfect Kiss, and the live version of Transmission from the 511 DVD. The fifth disk is just more enjoyable, so if you can get your hands on that, you can feel a bit more vindicated for buying such a bloated and redundant collection. Also, try to get the 511 DVD. It's the only Region One New Order DVD around that you may find somewhere in the States (your best bet: Canada or ...). Great concert from last year (2002)."
4,Great Collection,"Kudos to New Order for bringing this box out. It pretty much kept me occupied for the entire duration of a long road trip. Overall the third remix CD was my favorite. The 4 CD set did contain some cool mixes (e.g. the great mix of Confusion...which I only heard in the video version of the song), but some of them, such as Touched By The Hand of God was pretty much what I already heard in other New Order releases. I agree with the other review...the live CD was pretty [dull]. It sounded like it was recorded off of a tape recorder in someone's pocket. I got better quality sound from a video camcorder recording of my own band's live gig (in a dive bar...and not in a real venue!!). Overall it's a good get, but it's really for die-hard New Order fans only or for those of you who don't have Substance or the later New Order greatest hits CDs."
5,A Great Box Set,"Having read the other reviews, I thought I'd chime in with a few thoughts on Retro. I have purchased other box sets over the years and to be perfectly honest CD after CD of demos and out takes gets rather old (the worst example was Steve Miller's Box Set which featured a 4 year old Stevie singing). Retro was done by the fine folks at Rhino and the quality of the recording and song selection is great. The Fan disk and Pop disk are worth the price, if you can get the bonus 5th disk do so, it's worth the effort. Buy Retro and leave International alone, it's just a paired down version with the hits."
2,Disappointing!,"I love New Order but this box set a is a great big disappointment. For years fans were asked to wait - and for what - this rehash of bad live tracks and songs most of us have on official releases! Where are all the single remixes that are no longer available. Sorry, you'd be better off buying old 12 inch singles and CD singles and compiling your own box set."
5,missing the point...,I've already written one review but not published...anyway New Order are definitive and so is this. This set of disc is about a journey and seems to make more sence to UK fans than US. If you want to read reviews that mean something go to [www.amazon.co.uk] site and read them. The funny thing is that this was supposed to wind up the fans who wanted unrealeased tracks from Congleton Scout Hut in 1980...irony oh irony! My advice: buy it; listen to it; enjoy it...you will.
1,Here Are The Tired Old Men! A wasted oppertunity!,"Geez, New Order themselves admit in the newest issue of UNCUT that they were too lazy to put this box set together that's why other persons chose the tracks. Please Bobby Gillespie stick to what you know best, rehashing MC5. There are so many unreleased & rare tracks that these geezers could've put on this thing like a very early track with Stephen Morris on vocals which is excellent. Base in your face."
3,Nothing on pergolas,"This is a well written and useful book about a variety of outdoor construction projects, however, it fails to address pergola construction which was my specific interest. It would be most helpful to be able to view an entire index in a book like this, prior to its purchase."
5,Perfect Fox Puppet,"This fox puppet is the perfect size, look, and comfort. The school kids and I (their teacher) love using it in puppet plays and in dramatizing folk songs!"
2,That'll teach me not to read all the details on a pre-order,"5 stars for the show, 2 for this DVD.Like other posters, I was expecting the full season, not this abortive product. Only 3 episodes is ridiculous and rather pointless."
2,"Good show, disappointing DVD","The show's a gritty drama that has been compared with ""The Wire"". It's full of beautiful, celtic music, predominately from Loreena McKennit. If you want to know more about it, look it up on IMDb or Wikipedia. :)The point I want to make is about the DVD itself. I have only seen the first six episodes, so I was thrilled to get the DVD, thinking it would contain the whole series - all nine episodes. As I found out when I got the DVD, it only contains THREE episodes: the pilot episode, ""Every Dog Has Its Day"" (ep. 5) and ""One Acquainted with the Night"" (ep. 6). If you're a fan of any of the actors (I got it because of Ken Olin), okay, you'll get to see them a bit. If you want to watch the whole series, though, no luck. If I had known the DVD only came with three episodes on, I wouldn't have bothered."
1,Why would I buy this?,I loved this show when it originally aired and I would have really enjoyed to watch it again. In its entirety! Why would I buy a release that only includes some sample episodes? What moron had the asinine idea to release a half baked DVD like this one? I can't begin to describe how disappointed I am. Somebody else please release this (I mean all of it) soon!
3,I Know Where To See The Missing Episodes,"It was actually too painful to order this product when I found it was so incomplete. I watched the entire series, including the last, un-aired, episode over a few week period, by going to the Museum of Television and Radio (now called ""The Paley Center for Media"") in Beverly Hills, CA, and watching a couple each weekend. There is another branch in New York.The museum has a viewing library where you can go and watch not only these episodes, and many historic episodes of other great series, but they also have recorded interviews with the cast and creator of this show. The series still ended too abruptly, but did resolve a few loose ends. Perhaps order these episodes, and plan to watch the rest in California or New York."
3,Initially good but canceled; Network execs aren't the villians,"Well, maybe the Network execs aren't such dunderheads as reported so often.The 'Brilliant But Canceled' is a good marketing ploy, maybe aimed at moviemavericks. But just clever hype.Three episodes. Number one, very good in all aspects. Episode two, deducta star; Episode three, deduct another star. There must have been focus groupsreflecting the diminishing returns. Tension was vague, the plot meandered,and never resolved in the first three shows. Wish it wasn't so; with suchparticipants I expected much more.Haggis is a many-talented pro. Whatever soured EZ Streets (a deceptive titlefor such a grim, lifeless show), I expect it was mostly the writing; performanceswere fine; but sort of lethargic. The entire story just was so dark and sad, nobody won; not cops, trapped good people, sociopathic bad guys nor noble passerby's."
3,"Great show, but something is missing on this dvd","This was a great show that CBS messed with and then cancelled way too early. It was on in October, and it was off. It was on in March, and it was off. It was on in April, etc. CBS didn't even show the last episode, instead replacing it with an episode of Walker Texas Ranger at the last minute. At first I was glad to see it coming out on dvd and ordered it right away. Much to my chagrin though, I then saw that it only had 3 or 4 episodes instead of the whole 10. Bravo, come on, release the entire series. Don't cancel the Brilliant but Cancelled series by only releasing a few episodes.Excited, and then disappointed, Mr.Pibb in Michigan"
1,what's the holdup?,"It's a 5-star series, but only three episodes on this DVD 'set'? What a moronic thing to do. Why is it taking so long for an actual collection of all nine, including the unaired finale? It's been nearly ten years, and Paul Haggis has won Oscars... I mean, get moving, somebody. In the meantime, dear consumers, skip this poor excuse for an 'EZ Streets' set."
2,EZ pieces,"I like EZ Streets. It was gritty, It was complex and it had a soul that many crime shows never had. Suddenly, as it come on TV... it was canceled after eight episodes (here is only three episodes outta eight!).Written and created by Oscar Winner (for Crash) Paul Haggis, someone should tell Universal DVD division-if you say something is BRILLANT , Show me all the episodes! I agree it was, not let me have it!I will give it FIVE stars when there is a FULL collection of EZ Streets...Otherwise I leave the review at TWO starsBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
3,Ditto Mr. Robert Black,"First the network cuts/cancels this brilliant critically accalaimed series after only 8 shown episodes. Now the dvd producers do the same with only a 5 episodes dvd. I to will wait until someone see's fit to produce the ""complete"" series rendition on dvd."
4,"fast, fun, entertaining","This collection of great anecdotes from a career FBI agent is full of fascinating stories of bank robbers and their exploits. By turns exciting and humorous, the stories Rehder shares keep the reader involved and the pages flying. As a bonus, either Rehder or his co-author is really funny and has a way with words - lots of sharp, funny cop-talk. Perfect choice for a vacation, long flight, or weekend on the couch."
4,Petey Pal,Some things just seem to get better with age there style would even go well today this is when music was music.
1,Another compilation.....,"Yeeches! Yet ANOTHER compilation to MILK the fans! I love this group, and they deserve better. and if they can't put out sometime NEW,or not on Cd yet, then So be it...but keep releasing the SAME songs! (oh, I am sorry there is ONE new Track to cd on this compilation...THANKS!"
5,It's nice to be Gross.,"This is a hilarious comic novel about the Gross family and their adventures in The Bronx. It's the first in a series that was popular in the 30's and 40's and was used as the basis for two hit mucicals -- ""Having a Wonderful Time"" and ""Wish You Were Here."" I read them all as a young Marine on a troop ship crossing the Pacific and I've never forgotten them. Even if you're not Jewish, believe me, you'll enjoy!Sam Katz, Middletown, CT"
4,Sturdy Piece of Equipment,"I actually ordered this stand in hopes of it holding a subwoofer, but it did not fit mine and I had to send it back. However, that being said, it was a well made piece of equipment capable of holding an average size amplifier."
3,A great array of Cinderella versions,"I appreciate having access to the various versions. It's a rich collection. However, I wish the authors had been a bit more 'scholarly' and included their sources. Having that would allow one to authenticate, or trace back further. However, it's clearly a book for the general reader, and as such, functions well. The dialogues between mother-daughter, while lively, don't add much to the experience. If anything, theyseem extraneous."
1,Waste of money,"Finding pants that fit in early pregnancy is one hard task! I got tired of using the rubber band to extend my pants. It was obvious what I was doing when wearing my fitted (and getting even more fitted) tops. So I decided to try this waistband extender. I hated it! I thought it would be made of flexible material. It's not. It's made of hard plastic which is not comfortable to wear and there's no way to adjust it. You can only extend your pants as far as it's designed which might be a good amount for you but it wasn't for me (and again, as your belly grows, this doesn't grow with you).I would save your money and invest it in a Be Band or similar item. These are flexible material that look like tube tops. It fits comfortably around your waist and holds your un-buttoned pants together. No one can tell what you've got going on under. It comes in white or black and even if shows at the bottom, you can play it off as the bottom of your tank top."
2,"Hard, easy to fall off","I don't like this item very much. I bought this to extend my son's overalls. It is too hard to use, and kept falling off. So I had to stop using it.Maybe working elsewhere, but a waste of money for me."
1,Love for a Lifetime: Building a Marriage That Will Go the Distance,"I found this book to not only be shallow and poorly written, but also insidiously demeaning to women. Rather than focusing on the individual strengths and weaknesses men and women bring to relationships, the author focused on the weakness and instability of women. In addition, his examples and analogies were often misplaced and poorly devised... certainly not illustrative of his points or of a healthy marriage. I found the content much too general with overuse of stereotypes. My fiancee and I have read Chapman's Five Love Languages and got a great deal more out of that exercise."
1,this book has an agenda....,"Anytime the Christian Right has a chance to undermine women,it will take that chance and run with it.Please read ""The Myth Of Gender"" by Fausto- Sterling.Your eyes will be open to new possiblities for your life and family.The whole point of Dobson's book is to controll people so they fall into a limited mindset - male or female,with no room for the individual.The individual is reality not this sexist nonsense.I have always found it more easy to be out in the world and explore.Dobson makes women sound like natural cowards and fools.Very insulting."
5,This is the one marriage book everyone should read!,"I learned more about building and maintaining a happy marriage from this book than from all the other marriage books I've read combined, and I've read them all. This book is funny, easy to read, and filled with practical, solid christian advise. Dr. Dobson explains the differences between men and women and teaches basic lessons on communications and co-habitation that every married couple should know. I routinely give this book as gifts to newlywed and engaged couples. I've bought myself several copies because I keep giving them away to friends who have troubled marriages. I pray that God will bless your marriage as you read this book."
4,Who has the agenda?,"This is a GREAT book for engaged couples. Some of those that have written negative reviews (primarily, of Dr. Dobson himself) are the ones with the agenda. I wonder if they've even read this book. I just read this book and, as a Christian, I find it to be an easy-read and touches on major elements that couples must address... BEFORE THE BIG DAY. Dr. Dobson brings a good deal of experience, knowledge, and spirituality into this piece. I wish the book kept going. That is my only complaint. RECOMMENDED! I recommend it to ALL couples, but especially to Christians. If you're not a Christian, I think you will find value in this but please EXPECT Christian principles to be present."
4,"Good for those thinking of marriage, Christian or otherwise","This is a short, easy to read book, intended to give some advice to young couples contemplating marriage. This slow reader began and finished the book within a couple hours, but the length of time reading the book does not reflect how useful the book is. Some of Dobson's main points are: keep Christ as the center of your relationship (Dobson being an evengelical Christian, writing to others who strongly value Christ); make sure you see eye-to-eye on the big things and be prepared to get into big fights about little things; men and women think differently and it would benefit you greatly to learn the way the other sex thinks. Dobson writes in a fluid style and liberally sprinkles in anecdotes, research, and selections from others' works to make his points. In doing this, he makes his main points stand out and makes his book a fun, lighthearted one written about a subject that is anything but light. Recommended."
3,Good but not great,"I just graduated from HLS and I found this book to be pretty useful. Many of my classmates also used it. On balance, however, I'd say the Vault Reports guide was more useful. The Insider's Guide covers many firms, but the books sounds like it was written by law students -- a bit stilted and risk-adverse. The Vault Reports Guide was fresher and had deeper, edgier detail. In sum, I'd say both books are good efforts, but the Vault guide was my favorite."
4,A good read on modern Moscow,"The author humorously and accurately portrays some of the personalities of modern Muscovites, both foreign and local. Many major categories are covered: the artist, the potential emigre, the emigre who has returned, the indebted businessman, the mafia thug, the hard-as-nails old woman who's survived so much, the heavy-drinking, English-teaching foreigner, and more. They're all a very odd bunch, but he somehow makes them believable, and likeable.Everyone will enjoy the novel, but a small amount of Russian--at least the alphabet--and some time in Moscow itself will be needed in order to more fully understand all of the inside jokes.Highly recommended. This foreign resident of Moscow will lend it enthusiastically to others in order to give them a better idea of what it's like here."
5,LTMATT,This book is such a treasure. I love how it is structured with a quick overview on one page followed by more in depth descriptions on the following pages. The photos are a big help to explain in great detail the releases. The tips are also very helpful and at times very funny and always insightful. I highly recommend this book to supplement ESMT bodywork for the lay horse people and for others making this their career path. A great resource!!!
3,thought i was ordering the book received dvd,"Thought i was ordering the book. even a review discussed the book. I have not watched the dvd it may be great, but was in the book section of amazon. Looked up the book received the dvd. Not sure who made the mistake myself or amazon. Make sure it states ""book"""
5,Fantastic!!!,"I wanted to write a review even though I haven't completed the entire book. As I am only on chapter 4 (I apply each chapter before proceeding on), the responses I have gotten from each of my 4 horses have utterly amazed me. Two of my horses were rescues and quite nervous, this technique has helped in gaining their trust and teaching them that it's okay to relax. I highly recommend this book!"
5,horse massage,Very thorough and helpful. It is amazing when your high-strung horse responses to the massage exactly as the horses described in the book. I recommend this book to anyone. My neighbor bought one and it also very pleased with her purchase.
5,The funkiest damn CD in the world,"Billy Cobham scares me. He does. Every time I listen to this album it is so unbelievably funky that I get scared and have to sit down with a cool drink. I have the tunes and grooves going round my head right now - incredible, but frightening."
2,maybe someone could write a review with some substance??,"Yes, as everyone else has said, this is ""well funky"". I think what they are attempting to say is that it posesses a drive rarely seen in a band of this sort, ie. superstars all thrown together for a laugh by the uninformed record company execs. To find such huge names (namely, Cobham, Schofield, Alex Blake, and the Breckers) on a record together suggests it would be underprepared, underrehearsed and therefore have an air of underachievement. Unfortunately, whilst the drive is there, the quality of performance is not. For, me you'd be better to cut out the middle man, and just get it's predecessor, Spectrum. Then you'll want to ""put on your green stretch jacket and sunglasses and hit the road..."" very helpful mate....."
3,smaller than I thought,"I ordered this for my 19 month old because I wanted him to use it as a lovey, wooby,...something to go to sleep with. I was surprised at the size, I didn't guess that the length included the hat stretched out. It is really cute though and my son likes it, he sucks on the hat! I just pictured him dragging it around by the hat, but that isn't the case because it is more like the size of a beanie baby."
3,good story,"Excellent story. Could have been told in one hour, or filmmaker could have added a huge plot improvement from infinite material available during WWII in France. Acting is amateurish by today's standards."
2,Better books for you to buy,"A friend gave me this book and it's just not for us. While the ideas are based in nature or recycling in some way, lots of them require quite a bit of process, mess (mix sand, cornstarch and water in one of my saucepans) or strange items (like a loom, gourd, photo fixer or a hand drill) that you might not have laying around and have to make or buy. Also, most of the end product are not practical for indoors and you have to think about where this stuff is going to be after made.Ok having said that, there are a few ideas that are decent and the book lay out is in easy instructions and nice chapters with detailed instructions and illustrations."
4,Good value!,The receiver looks nice and has a good bunch of features. The only thing I don't like is that is has to move the faceplate to insert a CD. It moves it automatically so it's not such a big deal. Great sound quality and the menu is easy to use. It's a good radio if you're on a budget.
2,A small handbook,"I thought I was getting another ""version"" of the noted ""Baltimore Catechism,"" but this was nothing like that. It was just a small handbook, and not for children, as the St. Joseph Baltimore Catechism is, and which also comes in graded levels (Book 1, Book 2, etc.)."
1,There's a reason so very few people reviewed this book.,I read one of this author's other books and was very unsatisfied by it. I thought I'd give him another chance since I live in the area he frequently writes about. Keith Lee Morris does it again and fails to please.I had heard about him because a friend had read his book and hated it. I'd thought I'd see how bad he was. My friend was right.
2,Too full of jargon for me,"This is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read--with no background in either philosophy or cybernetics, much of what Hayles discusses is just plain incomprehensible. I also found it difficult to accept the idea of humans already being ""post-human."" If you are interested in deep philosophical writings on technology and the human condition, with links to literature, read this. If you don't really care about the post-human, skip it."
2,"Great Book, Bad E-Book","My low rating is not for the text itself, but for the kindle formatting. Normally, one would be able to transfer between each chapter by using the arrow buttons, but this e-book provides no links to be able to do that. This seems like very lazy e-book formatting. I wish I had just bought the physical copy.The text itself is excellent. If you are interested in this subject, N. Katherine Hayles is a fantastic writer who explains the posthuman very well."
3,Hayles Forgets and Didn't do her research,"Interesting how Ms. Hayles does not mention the transhuman or transhumanism, Max More and his seminal essay ""Becoming Posthuman"" written several years before Ms. Hayles book was published. Anyone using the book in their course work might want to think about this."
5,Wonderful book!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book; while I was reading it I had an art book and an atlas next to me so that I could follow the journey. Having just visited my daughter in Paris twice, who is a Student Abroad there, I was really taken by the author's wonderful experiences. The observations of life there are wonderful, learned a lot about art and France etc and wish I could do the same. Wonderfully relaxing and pleasant. Read it!"
4,"Baby, I know what you mean! Living the good life in France.","Kudos to the author! Jim Morgan does it again! The man keeps reinventing himself, moving forward in his quest to expand his personal horizons and live life to the fullest. After an earlier career as a successful magazine editor (Playboy, Southern Magazine), Morgan chucked it all to pursue his childhood dream of being a writer, like his hero Ernest Hemingway. Now, at the age of 62, he's written yet another beautiful book. This one is a moving paean to his love of Matisse, France, painting and his wife, Beth. If you've ever wanted to be inspired to take a chance on following your dream, Chasing Matisse may give you just the push you need. Buy it, read it, savor it, laugh over it. I'm sure you'll love it, just like I did!"
5,It's a Winner!!!,"I previously bought a HairArt H3000 Deluxe but it wasn't the professional model. After a year one of the plates fell down (I later learned that I could glue it back). The professional iron that I just purchased works great. Being an African American woman, my hair texture is naturally coarse and curly. With this new iron, it takes me half the time to straighten my hair out. It leaves my hair soft and very manageable (as though I had a relaxer). I love it. I do recommend that you use a heat protector on your hair as well as good judgments on your heat setting."
5,Best ever,"So my daughter has a complex about her hair and to appease her I ordered this flatiron after seeing it used in a YouTube video. 1, the shipping was amazingly fast. I thought I would get it a week lasted than I did. 2, my hair has never looked this good straight! I've never used the Chi so I don't know how it compares but I will definitely buy this flatiron as long as they make it. Can't beat the price either but I would pay $200 for this flatiron if it makes my hair look the way it does!"
4,Love it... but...,"I love the HairArt flat iron, but I really wish it had an auto shut off. I like that you can set the temperature and that the cord is long."
4,BEST IRON BUY BUY BUY,"I so love this Iron it was great not only its great its AFFORDABLE. Make you hair Bouncy,Silky,and Healthy looking, Feel so soft when you put your fingers through it, Gets even more shiner when you put hair serum on it, you don't even have to put nothing on your hair just wash and blow-dry it, Here's how you can treat your hair, wash it then you get some good conditioner put a shower cap on then sit under a dryer for 15 min if u don't have a hair dryer u can sit under, buy a soft bonnet attachment,attach it to your blow dryer, buy it at (Sally's Beauty Supply) or wherever for $10 its called the(Soft Bonnet Attachment) After that rinse out blow-dry it, now u can flatiron it."
1,GOOD LUCK !!!,I BOUGHT THIS CURLING IRON BECAUSE IT WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME. BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT THEY FRIZZ MY HAIR AND IF I TURN THE TEMP DOWN THEN IT DOESN'T STRAIGHTEN AT ALL. AND THE PART WHERE THE CERAMIC IS IS HOT AS WELL. I'M TURNING MINES IN FOR THE GHD'S BRAND
4,HOT!!!,Heats up almost instantly! I love it. I just hope it lasts since flat irons don't seem to have a long life.
4,Hairart Ceramic Flat Iron,"This flat iron works great. It heats up to the full 450 degrees very quickly. The one problem I have and the reason I did not give it 5 stars is that flat iron is a little heavy and bulky. Other than that, it works great and leaves my hair straight and shiny."
2,"Nice, but not happy.","So, I read all these reviews in November and thought wow it must last so long. So I bought it, and it's now the end of July, and it doesnt work now. This is horrible. I straighten my hair every day and now I can't. This isn't good at all. I really would like a new one or a refund."
2,Prefer the Chi,Bought this flat iron after reading all the positive reviews online. It's the first time I would have to say I did not agree with the reviews. I only paid about $20 more for the CHI that this iron was to replace but the CHI is worth the extra bucks. It does a much better job. Leaves hair shiny and totally frizz free. I guess if you don't have frizzy hair in humidity this iron would be adequate but I did not find it to be at all. Wish I could return it.
3,Okay fleece,"This is the second Columbia fleece I have owned that the zipper comes undone all the time. It though the first one was a fluke, until I bought a new one and had the same problem after only an hour of wearing it. I love the warmth and feel, but I don't think I will be purchasing anymore."
1,"This product may be OK, but I never received it from the seller The Fashion Rack.","I ordered this item through Amazon from The Fashion Rack on December 8, 2010 and never recieved it. I have ordered many things from Amazon and have always received them, but did not recieve my order from The Fashion Rack or a response from The Fashion Rack. I watched the USPS tracking as it came to my state then went to a totally different state. I emailed The Fashion Rack through Amazon and never got a response to my email. I have emailed a second time still waiting to hear something."
5,I love my jacket!,I have used this jacket under my ski jacket on cold winter days skiing as well as just general wear in cold Oregon weather. I love it! The Aegean Blue is a rich dark turquoise and is beautiful. The polyester fleece is soft and wicks moisture away from your body. It is a medium weight and not overly bulky. I would love to have a couple more in different colors!
5,Return only because it did not fit,I returned this item only because it did not fit. Money was given back to me for a UPS return. The customer service was wonderful. I would be happy to purchase from this company again.
4,"Average, but does what I want","I thought it would be more fitted (it's a very relaxed fit) and it does the tummy pooching thing that's very irritating, but overall I'm happy with it. It's pretty much the same as the Land's End fleece, except that it doesn't attract as much hair and lint and it is a much more reasonable price."
2,Not proportioned well for short women,"Although I ordered the size I usually wear, the sleeves were much too long and it wasn't large enough around the bust even though it was advertised as being loose fitting. Apparently this item was designed for tall, slender women with long arms. The advertising is misleading."
4,great fleece!,"I like this simple black fleece to throw on on a cold day. It goes with everything and is soft and versatile. I wish it blocked the wind a little better, but its still pretty warm. Good buy!"
3,Fleece Jacket,"My husband bought me a Columbia Fleece jacket awhile back (from Bass Pro Shop) and I wanted another one to wear around the house. When I opened this one I noticed that the fleece was alot softer and thinner. I also noticed that the Columbia logo was on the left side of the jacket and the logo on my original jacket is on the right. I don't know if that is relevant to anything, but the quality of this jacket is definately less than my original. I am not going to go through the hassle of a return because it is an okay jacket to wear around the house on chilly mornings. It came with a $50 price tag attatched and I know I would definitely not spend that much for this particular jacket."
2,"Ok, but I expected more.","I owned a similar Columbia jacket years ago (not sure exact style) but I know that even then I wouldn't have spend an arm and a leg on it, so I figured it was reasonable to compare the two. This jacket feels incredibly cheap! It's ok, keeps me warm. A nice light fleece, but I was expecting something a little heavier and more durable. Hanging this over the back of my chair, I was worried that the posts on the chair were going to pop a hole through! They aren't pointy and are a good size, at least an inch, and this wasn't by exerting any sort of force on the jacket.The seller shipped me the wrong color anyway, and I'm supposed to be getting a full refund. Otherwise, I'd likely return it and fork some money out for something worthwhile."
3,VERY THIN,It is not what I expected at all. I have another fleece that I paid alot less for and it keeps me warm. This is paper thin. Disappointed in this columbia jacket
3,From the Wilderness-Great book,"This first book ,which should be a good reference for the style of his future novels, starts with a bang, and is very easy to remain interested in. It seems that there is never a dull moment, just action, action, and more action, accompanied by an overwhelming flow of emotions. The only major dissapointment is excessive use of inappropriate language."
4,Barile is Back !,"Jim is from another world and so is his music. A protege of Neil Young, Albert Lee, Delaney Bramlett and many others, he sings, composes and marches to the beat of a different drummer. ""Dislocated Moments"" is a particularly lovely piece, a haunting, ethereal instrumental guaranteed to take you down the untraveled path to peace and relaxed contemplation.His first album in years,I look forward to the next."
2,"OK, but Encarta is better","Having previously used the computer version of Encarta, I thought I'd try out the computer version of my classic Britannica. Yes, you can type in keywords and pull up resaonably well-written articles. The fun stops there. The articles contain few images: for example, I was looking up various famous people, minerals, and world landmarks, yet was disappointed to find no pictures at all in any of the articles I found. Most disappointingly, Britannica lacks the super-cool 3-D tours of famous world sites and 3-D zoomable and rotatable world atlas that Encarta does so well."
2,too brief to be useful,"I purchased Britannica because my children needed a vetted source for their high school assignments and their teachers would not accept Wikipedia. Unfortunately, Britannica's coverage is too superficial to be of used. The entire product is contained on a single CD. The first topic I looked up was the New Deal; Britannica gave it 674 words; Wikipedia 11,871. I looked up several others; all with similar results. To me, Britannica is no more than a glorified dictionary. At that, Encarta is better.The product installed and functions without problem on Windows XP SP2."
1,Won't Install,"Have tried about six times to install it. I've followed all of the online troubleshooting advice, all to no avail. It says it installed with three nonfatal errors and five warnings. It tells you to check the log. Well, there are over 85k entries and even if I found the errors I don't see any way to correct the errors. When I try to run it I get ""starter MFC Application has encountered a problem and needs to close"". I'll be returning this puppy to Amazon for a replacement."
3,Quite good,"I haven't used it extensively, but seems good for topics I searched. But nothing beats Wikipedia - and ease of use it has - just for sake of authentic material - I bought this product. Thats why only 3 Stars."
4,Disasterlad on Britannica,I trust the information I find from Britannica and so invested in the 2007 Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.It has something for everyone.I use it side by side with Microsoft Encarta and together I get a more complete subject review.I prefer the content of Britannica but for ease of use Encarta is still superior.I look forward to Britannica making the interface and ease of use better in future productions and that is why I am only able to award 4 stars.
5,the text is great; the rest is junk,"This is a great encyclopaedia, and it is a fabulous deal to get it cheaply on DVD. While it is not as extensive and up-to-the-minute as Wikipedia, the articles are much better written and more reliable. (I warn my students not to trust anything on Wikipedia.)The text of the articles on the DVD appears to be identical to that of the printed version; however some of the figures from the printed version appear to be missing from the DVD. (I can't be sure about this because I am comparing with the 2002 printed version.) Unfortunately, the maps on the DVD are of much lower quality than those in the printed version.The interface for reading the articles is pretty good. It features tabbed browsing, and it gives you whole articles (unlike a previous edition).In my opinion the multimedia extras are cheesy and not worth the disk space. Maybe children will like them, I don't know. Anyway, get this for the text, not for the extras."
4,The Wonders of Childhood,"This excellent novel is about how when you beleive, anything is possible. Three children, two sisters and a brother, make up a game called The Rellard to play when they are sick. They continue to play as they get well. Creating a series of trials, they crown the youngest, Lucy, as The Rellard. Little do they know at the time, the powers that the Rellard holds are real."
3,Not Eoin Colfer.,"I don't know why everyone is giving this five stars. I disagree. I am twelve years old and I can't say I hated it, but it is nothing compared to other Eoin Colfer. I found this an aggravatingly simple read, and it does not Eoin's style. There is an extremely frustrating Irish accent that is evident throughout the book (lads, lasses, 'top of the morning', and more), and the characters don't develop as you would expect. Sure, the story isn't bad, I'll grant Eoin that. Overall, an OK read that won't thrill you and doesn't sound like Eoin."
2,Artemis Fowl fans beware--not as good,"I got this book for my daughter because we both loved Artemis Fowl, Colfer's other novel. This one unfortunately does not measure up. But rush out to buy Artemis Fowl if you haven't already."
4,"Bad Timing, Perceptive Thinking","No one really wants to read Didion's perceptive take on partisan politics and the theatricality of the entire political process during trying, uncertain times such as these. Nevertheless, Didion shines here. She's at the top of her form -- her lean, angry prose illuminating the horrors of the United States intervention in the El Salvadorian civil war, the odd rise to power of the odd Newt Gingrich, the bewildering Reagan presidency. Though she's very much a leftie, the nature of this inquiry is into all things political, and Dukakis as much as Bush is a target for Didion's scorn. Didion is an incredible writer and a capable thinker and in general we need more political books of this ilk -- books that aspire to illuminate, educate, not obfuscate."
5,Outstanding,"A very centered approach to both parties through the election cycles, Didion has produced another masterpiece."
3,Obtuse Style,"I agree with a reviewer below. The author presents some intriguing views of political Washington. Yet, it is very difficult to read. Ms. Didion's writing style is at best, obtuse. Lengthy sentences holding multiple ideas with perplexing digressions are the norm. This book could have been written well with half the ink."
2,Exactly what I said when I received this,"There is some valuable stuff but:An entire chapter of titles?An entire chapter of Success Stories?Filler, the both of them. Obvious and blatant.The info here that is helpful would have fit in a 50 page e-book"
3,Smell the Irony,"So this is a non-fiction niche book about how to write non-fiction niche books...does anyone else see the irony here? McCutcheon tells you how to sell people a book they never knew they needed, and he does so by selling a book you never knew you needed. Three stars for sheer gall."
5,Great book for aspiring authors!,"Read this book for some great advice and motivation. This book has some valuable advice on writing your first book. It covers advice on what to write, evaluating your idea and whether or not it will make a profit, writing Query letters to editors, negotiating your pay, what not to do in query letters, book promotion and tips on writing. I read this book in a day and I have to say for a guy that never graduated High School I'm pretty impressed with him. This book had more good tips and advice than any other writing book I've read, besides Novelists Boot camp. Well worth your time."
4,Damn! Why Didn't I Write That!,"McCutcheon did a good job in this book, the first thing came to my mind after reading the book is ""Damn! Why Didn't I Write This book :)"" it is simple , easy to read , and usefull book that will help you start writing your first book."
4,One of the Better Books Available for Beginning Non-Fiction Writers,"There are countless books on writing, promoting, and selling non-fiction that generally encompass the same topics, and this book is no different. Among these books however, McCutheon's work stands out as one of the better written, organized and descriptive manuals. Damn Why Didn't I Write That covers the basics: book topics, topic validity, credibility, improving writing, agents, editors, publishing, and self promoting. The book stands above many others because the descriptive examples are specific and motivating.I recommend this book to any writer or would be writer hoping to put together a qualified piece of non-fiction. McCutheon answers questions regarding the quality of your work and its viability in terms of potential salability. While this book alone is not enough to make one successful, it presents a terrific primer for any beginning writer hoping to get published."
5,"If You Don't Like the First Word in this Title, Get Over It","Some readers will be put off from the title of this book. Get over it. Marc McCutcheon has written a well-done motivation book to encourage someone who knows very little about publishing. Step-by-step this book introduces you to the world of nonfiction writing.As he says at the conclusion of the first chapter, ""Okay. Ordinary people can write extraordinary books. We've just seen a few examples to prove it. Are you inspired? Is your adrenaline flowing? Is your heart beating paradiddle in your chest? If a little voice inside your head is shouting, ""Good heavens, I could do this,"" run, don't walk, to the next chapter. The fact is, if you think you can, you can.""Every writer whether you are a beginner or a professional can gain something from this how-to title. I recommend it."
5,A Very Helpful and Complete How-to for Writing NonFiction,"An excellent all-in-one text for anyone wishing to get started writing non-fiction books. The author inspires confidence by listing many highly successful non-fiction books written by ordinary people. After helping you gain confidence, Marc attempts to get your creative juices flowing by providing a list of the various types of non-fiction along with examples of each type.Chapter coverage includes whether or not to use literary agents, how to write query letters and proposals, with many examples provided. Also included is what to expect in royalty and contract negotiations including rights. Finally, Marc provides tips on promotional efforts and many helpful hints on writing and getting the job done. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in writing a non-fiction book. The text was easy to read and provided complete coverage of all the essentials and and much more."
5,Paints the Picture and Inspires,"McCutcheon paints a picture that shows you really can write a book, even if you are an ordinary person, with no previous writing skills or expertise. As this book illustrates, thousands of average people have managed to write exceptional books that see extraordinary sales.McCutcheon gives tons of examples of top selling titles published by everyday people, on everyday subjects. By the time you are finished reading, you will not only have the tools, but even more important, the confidence to write and publish a book.Stacie Vander Pol, author of Top Self Publishing Firms"
2,too much fluff,"I understand that a book must have a certain number of pages to command the posted price. ""Filler"" of ""Fluff"" is often used to build the page count to an acceptable total. I must say that this book contains too much fluff. It could have said all that needed to be said in less than 90 pages and save us all, including Mr. McCutcheon lots of time."
1,A waste of money,This book is not helpful at all if one is thinking of beginning a writing career. It is repetitious and the info is dated. Don't bother.
3,Metallica Sounding Band About 10 Years To LATE!,Its an okay album I bought it second hand for 5 bucks they really try hard to sound like old Metallica and do an okay job but still I think copying them is a little old and has been done by a million other bands.
3,Fantastic Production of Shakespeare--Poorly advertized.,"I specifically went looking for a DVD of this production to use in my theatre classes. I either didn't read the ad closely enough or there was no mention of the fact that this particular DVD was from Europe, and not compatable with US DVD players. Luckily, I can play it for my classes via a computer --- but it could have been a huge expense for an unusable purchase.Now, as far as the Marc Singer/Fredi Oster Production, this is a great way to get high school students to watch Shakespeare and enjoy it.Just be sure to look for a version that is USA compatable."
5,Excellent wordless book,"This review is in response to a previous reviewer's comments that she did not realize that the book was wordless. She gave the impression that she was disappointed by receiving a wordless book, which her nephew cannot ""read.""I agree that it should be more clear that this book is wordless, but I would encourage you not to discount it on this basis. The book is very funny, and wordless books help children develop linguistic and narrative skills. Have the child ""read"" the book to you, or his parents. You can also tell the story to him at exactly his linguistic level (or slightly above it), not with the one-size-fits-all vocabulary and syntax of other children's books. It would be great if you could notice where he struggles in his descriptions when reading the book, and then expand upon his attempts the next time you read it to him. If you give it a chance, you might like a wordless book.. and so might your nephew."
1,No words,"I ordered this book for my 3 year old nephew and was surprised to receive a book without any words. I think in the description of the book, rather than saying ""English"", it should say picture book. I am a fan of Mercer Mayer but preferred to buy one that this little boy could grow into in his reading."
4,great product,Product arrived promptly and in good condition. Was a little disappointed that it was not possible for me to add a message to this product as most other items allow you to do - it was a birthday gift for a friend and it would have been nice to let her know who had sent it without her having to study the packing slip!
1,Not Impressed,"If you are an agent that is absolutely clueless as to what the internet is and how it can help you in the selling business, buy this book. It is very basic. Im not sure what i expected of the book but I have since started my own online business. If the book inspired me at all it was to show me that it can be done. Just dont expect much logistical perspective."
3,Could be better...,"I needed something to get my pictures off of my z500a cell phone and found that this was the only product avaliable for that. It gets the job done but I hate the software that it comes with, it clutters up your computer with unessicary stuff and the connection is slow making it a pain to get all the big pictures and video clips off. But other then those issues it works fine and is the only thing you can get at this time to connect to a computer from one of these phones."
3,OK cable,"This cable is okay for transferring stuff between phone and PC but it does not charge the phone. If all you want to do is transfer stuff, then this cable will help. If you want a cable that will charge as well as transfer stuff, you may have to look for another product."
2,Tried several BT transmitters... this was the worst of the lot.,"I have three BT headsets that I use to test transmitters. This didn't pair with any of them, whereas every other BT transmitter tried paired with all thee. I finally did find a BT receiver it would pair with, a 'Black Diamond Bluelink', but the range was terrible... no more than 15 feet with a clear unobstructed space between them. Even at 15 feet, the audio would occasionally become choppy. At 10', the audio was solid, fidelity good, and a relatively short latency compared to other transmitters I tired (thus the two star rating)."
3,Pretty,This piece is pretty but it was alittle too tight on the neck for me. I wish I would have looked to see if it was avail. in a longer style. I will look again. Unfortunately i sent it back.
2,I thought you were a role model...,"I'm a private in the Canadian Forces RCR and just finished reading James Davis' book about a month ago and I have to say that it was well written for the most part. I picked it up because I wanted to learn more about overseas tours the Canadian Army participated in and this book told me a lot and will definetely help me to expect the circumstances I have to deal with when I am there. The story is good, dealing with everything from basic training to Sarejevo so I could relate to a bit and I think it would also serve purpose to those who are considering joining the CF."
1,Do not buy this,"I paid no attention to the other bad reviews here and went ahead and bought this. I also bought the LaCie firewire speakers. I hooked those up first and the sound is WOW! Great little speakers. I then connected the LaCie Speakers to this piece of junk hub and guess what? The speakers made this terrible sound, the hub started smelling like it shorted and now my speakers don't work. Over a $150 fried. Do not buy this hub. The connectors are loose, it will not stand upright. It is a total mess. If I could give this zero stars I would. A complete piece of junk."
5,Great sport sandal,"I have owned several pairs of sport sandals and these Columbia Interchange sandals are by far the most comfortable and best fitting of them all. The bed of the shoe is well padded and does not stick to the bottom of your foot while walking. Velcro straps throughout the shoe are sturdy and extended length to better fit more people. This shoe had an interchange feature that I really enjoyed because I feel that I am able to get more use out of the shoe rather than having to wear it only one way. The tread on this shoe is hearty and grips well over a wide variety of terrains. I could be comfortable wearing these on something as short as a trip to the store or for an all day outing to a theme park. Sturdy and well built, I highly recommend them."
4,Barney's Version,"Well worth the read!!! Barny Panovsky is, intelligent, synical, disrespectfull and hopeless - but is brutally honest with himself and knows all this! It's a very 'in your face' laugh at loud at times, read. Would highly recommend this book to anyone who thinks outside the square and loves dry wit!"
4,A witty novel full of real-life characters.,"Mordecai Richler at his best. Witty, cynic, funny. This reminds me of The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz and Joshua Now and Then. For me, a novel that makes you wish evening was here, so you can get back reading it...is always a winner, and this is the case. A very lively description of life in Montréal and Paris in the 50's and 60's. A novel that is not only entertaining but from which you learn a lot."
3,OK,"I enjoyed it, but the beginning dragged. He reminded me of someone I knew fondly. you ask to much of readers in this review process. How dare you demand more words?"
3,Barney's Gripes,"The main character in this abbridged CD version of Barney's Version is an irritating alcholic who does nothing but click his glass to let the listener know he is drinking yet another scotch,(or whatever),coughs his phlemy cough and feels sorry for himself. What is the point of this book other than a character study of a sad sack guy who drives everyone he loves away from him (including the reader) and then obesses over the loss of wife # three whom he really loved? OH yes, and his guilt re: the guy that drowned after drinking too much with his drinking buddy, because he (Barney) didn't stop him"
4,Politically Incorrect,"Barney's politically incorrect perspective could easily offend but give him time and you'll see his sense of humour (reminiscent of Ken Finkelman's CBC programme ""Newsroom""). He's so unapologeticially vulgar and obnoxioius and yet I grew very fond of the old Fart. ""Listening"" to his lifestory was a voyeuristic experience. His relationships with parents, extended family, friends and wives were fascinating and multi-dimensional. The ""who dunnit"" part of the story seemed minor -- just a thread to pull along as he recounted the annecdotes of his life. I almost wanted to pour myself a double malt scotch and pull on a Montecristo as I read."
5,Compact and capable,Having this product allows me to safeguard my data in the event of a crash. Anyone who has crashed a computer will appreciate saving information that otherwise be deleted during a OS re-load.
4,What's In the Box?,"Just the facts.Before there was Lieutenant Columbo there was Sergeant Joe Friday.The set contains:Big CrimeBig PairBig ProducerBig BreakBig September ManBig BettyBig TrunkBig ThiefBig GirlBig MotherBig CastBig Phone CallBig CasingBig LampBig SeventeenBig .22 For ChristmasBig GrandmaBig ShowBig HateBig RodBig FrankBig BarretteIt's ""big"".22 episodes big.Or maybe that should be .22 episodes big."
3,Made in Mexico?,"I recently purchased this item which was clearly described in the ad as ""individually handcrafted in Lancaster, Pennsylvania."" However, on the bottom of the product is a label. It appears that the label was intentionally trimmed so that you cannot see that the tag says, ""Made in Mexico."" Whoever trimmed the label should have done a better job of hiding this fact if they want to sneak it past unsuspecting customers. I don't know about you, but to me, this appears to be a clear case of false advertising. I thought Amazon.com was above this kind of thing."
4,Relaxing if a bit repetitive,"The entire album (and it's almost an hour long!) is comprised of traditional tingklik music. The tingklik is a percussion instrument made up of dried bamboos with a sound very similar to a xylophone, if not a bit more earthy. It is very relaxing, but can be repetitive if you're not in the right frame of mind."
3,"""How to live in the wilderness, with a sixties sensibility.""","There are 276 pages in this book, 241 of which tell you where and how to live in the wild. Don't pay any attention to the criticism that this book somehow promotes a by-gone communist or socialist world-view. Some info is dated, of course, but there is still lots of useful information for the back-to-nature set."
5,"Decent quality, easy to mount","As the title says it's easy to mount, it comes with the materials you need to mount it to either an enclosed trailer or a open landscape trailer. I gove it 5 stars but I felt it was missing one key element, I chose not to mark it down because it didn't say that it had it provided but a way to cut the trimmer line would be key. I thought it needed it so much that I actually welded a razor to the bottom arm of the bracket, I may remove it and make a bracket that can clamp one down in place. Good product despite that."
5,Callaway dishes,The dishes are great. The pattern is cheerful. I like the fact that these come with the glasses instead of cups. I use mugs for coffee and always had a lot of unused cups.
5,Classy and Practical!,"I love this set...Corelle is a given great, but the Ivy pattern of the Callaway design is wonderful, and the swirl effect makes it classy. I love it so much I am buying for a wedding gift this summer."
5,great set!,"I've had my set for almost 10 years and they still look great. The only thing I have a problem with are the glasses. I only have 1 juice glass left. All the rest broke in the dishwasher or even when hand washed! I never bought the silverware, but I have seen it at Wal-Mart during the Christmas season. Oh and the tea kettle rusted. But everything else is suberb!"
2,A straightforward approach to an incorrect method,"David Weston's method of dog training follows right along in the modern tradition of ""operant conditioning,"" which I had not heard of before reading this book. Therefore it was not a previous bias which caused me to discount the method as completely inappropriate to dog training! A dog is not a lab rat, to be ""shaped"" unwittingly by the presence or absence of food. It is disrespectful to your dog to assume so. However, if all you want is the behavior and you don't care about the rapport, or if you have a particularly sensitive dog that doesn't respond well to ""traditional"" methods, this book is an easy to follow manual of how to make it at least appear obedient."
4,beautiful but.....,"When we put this product up it was very beautiful it just seem to fit the style of our house. We installed it in our bathroom (which it says thats what it could be used for) during the day u have privacy but at night when its dark out and you put the bathroom light on it doesn't give u privacy at all you can't make out detail but you can definately tell if someone is wearing clothes or not. Also I don't know how long they expect you to go without showering?, I took a shower the next day and had to squeegee all bubbles out of it again so definately watch for that when we had installed it there were no bubbles or creases at all but when u shower moisture gets under it again until it fully adhears to the window."
3,Better sources elsewhere,"The internet has essentially made this book obsolete since you can find more comprehensive research online. Also, heaven knows how they select the firms for the book since there are many very respectable firms that are unlisted."
1,don't be fooled,I bought this monitor around 6 month ago. It has following drawbacks:1. the DVI interface doesn't work at all.2. the integrated speakers produce low quality sound3. It needs a adapter4. Never get the $100 mail-in rebate the manufacturer promised.
5,great book,This is a great book for the whole family. Good to read anytime but especially before Thanksgiving.
4,Toy quality spine model,"I bought this for a colleague after she commented repeatedly on how much she liked the full size high quality model of the spine that I have in my office. Since I'd intended the purchase mostly as a joke, this served the purpose well. It is close enough to anatomical accuracy to demonstrate some very simple concepts and it does fit nicely on a desk. However, the construction of and connection between the vertebrae makes it impossible to position the spine with a normal curvature so it ends up looking like a stack of vertebrae hanging from a string with a pelvis at the bottom. Also, the spinal nerves are cheap plastic with ""flaps"" hanging along the seams, I assume from the plastic molding process. Overall, this is quite suitable as a novelty or a toy."
1,NOT VERY GOOD,WHEN I RECEIVED IT AND GOT IT OUT OF THE PACKAGE ONE OF THEM BROKE WHEN GETTING IT OUT SO I HAVE ONE GOOD ONE AND ONE BAD ONE...
1,defective product,"I installed roughly 10 of these and every one has failed within a year of being put in service. Some of them have failed multiple times and some have failed in a manner of months. Most common problem is a loud humming with audio output. Sometimes the LCD displays go dark or just stays backlit with no visible informationor a garbled display. Whats worse is Crowns warrantee procedures. They will warrantee the unit, but the average turn around time is nearly 2 months. I have been told there is a known issue in the power supply (heat sink not large enough?) and they will also change the cover for one that has big cooling vents on the top. When your customer relies on this unit for their music in a club they aren't exactly willing to wait for 7 or 8 weeks to get their music back.I wound up buying three amps from another manufacturer to loan my customers while these are being fixed.The price point is tempting...but run away from this one. Pay a bit more for something reliable."
5,awesome seats for street car,"Great seats for a street car, very comfortable, very supportive, great on long drives and hard cornering. NOT for fat or very wide hipped people."
4,Good story - relevant,A well written story that I've passed on to another person. She read it and has since passed it on. Interesting and relevant. A fun story with a strong underlying theme.
3,"Attractive book, but...","This book was very attractively laid out.It has a pleasing design. I had a giggle at some of the quotes. I'll give it credit for that. But this book included some nasty, unverified , untrue rumors about Elvis and James Dean and I find that offensive. I wonder how well they researched Jimmy in particular because Pier Angeli was left totally out of his list of Girlfriends and everybody knows she was the love of his life.Because of all that, I can only give it 3 stars."
4,A Valuable Resource,Mary Burmeister is a master of Jin Shin Jyutsu and makes this art of simple and gentle accupressure available through her book with step-by-step illustrated instructions. I recommend it as a valuable resource for those practicing healing or preventive care.
5,Incredible!,"I love this book. I happen to frequent a library with very old books, and I picked this up when I was pregnant.The author recounts several true (sometimes heartbreaking) situations to show the reader different angles, from ethical, political, and medical, to emotional. He poses many questions and leaves the reader to make up his or her own mind, of course.This is an exceptionally insightful book, espeically for being twenty years old!"
4,An excellent introduction to piracy worldwide.,"Philip Gosse has written a thorough overview of worldwide piracy; concentrating, of course, in the Mediterranean and Caribbean, but including the Far East. Even three cases of female pirates are covered. The subject is described both in breadth and depth, with many ""sea stories"" included. The only drawback is that some famous pirates, like Jean Lafitte, receive little coverage."
1,Total Failure,My rabbit was way too smart for this kind of thing. She slipped right out. Get a cat harness for your rabbit instead. It's secure and it doesn't bother them when they're in it (getting it on is another matter).
1,Not recommended,I think its too thin and tightens as my rabbit runs. Rabbits are skidish by nature so having anything like that around their neck is stressful. I am going to use it for my bearded dragon and wrap it around the dragon like a vest. I would recommend a vest for sure!
5,Taking Care o f Business,"I really enjoyed this book. I took the time to read it during Christmas of 2007 on a train ride. Very detailed and well written.Pastor WhitmoreDenver, CO"
3,"A Classic, but Like Many Classics, Dated","There is no doubt that this is one of the great classics in the world of origami. But, just as Shakespear and Dickens are great documentations of the Elizabethan and Victorian Ages, Honda's book is a documentation of the ""state of the art"" in the early 60s. The majority of the animal folds are compound (two sheets of paper are joined after folding; usually head and tail), and extensive ""sculpting"" is required to form pleasing results. This is NOT the book for people looking for the technical wizzardry of Montroll, Lang, Brill, et al. I place great value on it as a historical document, but it is certainly NOT the first of my 40 or so origami books that I turn to if looking for a model to fold. I wish Japan Publications would re-release the unabridged edition - even in soft cover."
3,Wonderful for beginners,"As stated in the title, this book is wonderful for beginners. The use of compound folding is easy enough, but doesn't really stick true to the fundamentals of traditional origami, as I've heard it. Don't let yourself get held down by folding only compound animals. Check out other books as well... I personally loved this book! heh."
4,An Eternal Beauty,"If you, like me, have always admired photos of Ms. Brooks but never took the time to watch one of her films you're in for QUITE an experience.She has a screen presence that's hard to describe. Aside from her obvious beauty she transmits something in her eyes that jumps across three quarters of a century and confronts you as a woman of contemporary society. Very little of the usual silent film hand-wringing and eyelash-batting takes place here, instead she draws us in with subtlety, thankfully at the hands of a great director.The camerawork is genuinely moving, genuinely beautiful in many ways. A few times I found myself hitting the pause button to admire a still frame, worthy of hanging in a gallery on its own and out of context.A perfect introduction to Pandora's Box, which will knock you out of your chair."
5,An unusally good silent film,"What a surprise. Terrific silent film that I purchased only as a result of reading about Louise Brooks in Wikipedia, after finding out about her in the book: The Chaperone."
3,Basically a Snidely Whiplash type of film,"It's an interesting story of a beautiful maiden (Brooks) with a couple of villains trying to take advantage of her. Seems like just about all the men are trying to take advantage of her now that I think about it. And she plays this demure and coy girl thrust into the big bad world. Remember, it's a German silent movie."
4,"Well made, but very slow moving!",This film is pretty good in general. Louise Brooks really is versatile and talented. Too bad this film moves so darn slow! This film would have gotten a five if it moved faster and wasn't so tragic.
4,Actually Pabst's best vehicle for the lovely Louise,"This film, made after the highly provacative ""Pandora's Box"" is somehow sweeter, more tranquile and contemplative in its depiction of a young girl who's lost herself down the wrong tracks. Louise Brooks is at her most beautiful here- I wonder what Pabst was thinking when he planned this film after the release (as in a venting of sexual violence, guilt and idolatry; not the film's release to cinemas) of Pandora's Box. Here Louise plays the victim throughout- not the femme fatale who must die in her own trap in Pandora. Her character- a fine, delicate spirit who must inhabit sorrowfully the vile places of the professional woman companion and hang with the vile men who frequent those places- is possibly the most compelling heroine of the whole silent era."
2,Shovel is Tiny,I bought the Snowivor kit thinking I was getting a normal sized shovel. Instead I got a shovel you would normally keep in your car for emergencies. If they made a wider shovel it might be worth buying. This thing is tiny. The swivel handle works well.
5,SnoEasy Ergonomic Snow Shovel Review,Great shovel. It will be great on my back this winter. It was super easy to put together.
1,this vender gets no stars,this vendor sent one out of six videos in a boxed set. i paid for all six. there was no explanation included in the package. i will contact my bank to see if they can do anything.
1,a poorly designed and executed reproduction,"All but three of the 306 pages were scanned as right-left double-page spreads of what was a 500+ page original. Those individual images were printed in the portrait orientation, i.e., across the top of the 6"" (narrow) width, of each right-side page of this paperback. Furthermore, nearly every page of this book showed nothing but the outline of the scanned pages, and what was infrequently visible as a footnote was too small to read. Clearly there was absolutely no quality check in the design or execution of this 'forgotten' book."
5,Avant-Garde and Stylistic,"This French film was the directorial debut for a then 26-year-old Luc Besson. Christopher Lambert and Isabelle Adjani are a surprise great match. It's both a romantic comedy and social satire over a group of vagabonds who live underground in the Paris metro system. There is more than one story with Adjani and Lambert tying in the characters. It is not clear what the ""papers"" are that Lambert has stolen from Adjani, which hints that its a ploy on both ends to spend time together."
3,Non-subtitled Version Laughable,"Having seen this film in the theater in 1985, I recommended it to many of my friends as one of the more enjoyable movie experiences of my life. Unfortunately, all that seems to be commercially available is the English dubbed version, which fails to capture the mood of the original film (the poor quality of the dubbing is jarring)"
1,SUCKS,"Listen, I was an extra in this film when it was made. This is the dubbed version. IT SUCKS! Make sure that you have a subtitled version of this film. This version is horrible!"
3,Interesting.,"SUBWAY is a very interesting movie. It's more of a movie that is focused on the characters, rather than the plot itself. Definitely buy the enhanced version (the one with Lambert holding the neon light). The dubs aren't that great, but at least Lambert dubbed himself. I suggest watching it with the subtitles first. Being a Lambert fan, I figured I'd check out the film in which he won best actor in France's Caesar Awards. It's a very interesting movie, I more appreciated it, but it was entertaining nonetheless. Worth the buy if you're a Lambert or Besson fan."
2,The movie is great BUT...,"Do not, I repeat, do not buy this specific version of this otherwise great (i'd rate it 4) movie - someone has put english voiceovers on this french movie. All nuances are missed - try to find another version, with french still intact."
1,"VERY POOR QUALITY DVD, WAIT ANOTHER RELEASE","Unfortunately I bought it because I like Luc Besson's movies. No French soundtrack, very poor image quality, no subtitles, and full screen ... AVOID IT (I give it one star because it's the lowest rating, but it does not even worth it!)"
1,Completely ruined by poor transfer,"What a waste of plastic. One of my favourite films by my favourite director completely ruined. The transfer is reminiscent of a 10 year VHS rental copy and suffers from VHS video dropouts throughout the film. It's full-frame and not widescreen. The sound is very hissy Pro-Logic, and worst of all, the most heinous crime is that he soundtrack is DUBBED into English and there's no French soundtrack available! Admittedly it is dubbed by Lambert, Adjani et al. themselves, but the fact that it's not the original language just ruins it for me. Seriously distance yourself from this version and keep your fingers crossed that eventually this film will get the careful DVD transfer it so rightly deserves."
1,"If you haven't seen this DVD yet, DON'T !","Watching the movie on this DVD ruins a great movie. I've read all the reviews saying how bad the transfer is, and I didn't quite believe it. How bad can it be ? I finally got hold the DVD yesterday, it's BAD, in fact it's beyond BAD! The VHS tape (with French soundtrack/english subtitle) would be a much better choice, I think it would even offer better video than the DVD!4.5 stars for the movie. 1 star for the DVD"
1,Great Movie - Awful DVD,"This is one of the great movies of the 80's. True, it's a little dated now but still it's a classic of the period and remains some of Besson's and Lambert's best work. I'd strongly recommend not watching let alone buying this English only version. If you've seen the original you'll be disappointed, if you haven't you'll wonder what drug those positive reviewers were on. There is/was a PAL format VHS, in French with English subtitles, worth owning if you have a switchable format player. Otherwise lets hope someone produces a better DVD version of this classic."
2,"Great music, ok movie, terrible DVD","Christopher Lambert can't act now, and this proves he never could. Still, the movie is about style and music, and as such succeeds. However, the DVD image quality is only as good as a poor video. It even has dropouts in the image. Audio is hardly better. The only good thing is that it cannot degrade more ..."
4,Beats any 90's Hollywood film. But who's surprised?,Good off-beat European film with interesting view of Paris. Just a generally different point of view than American formulaic film-making. Definitely not a film for the average American viewing audience which obviously has an average IQ of less than 90 judging by what movies sell in the States.
2,WARNING!,"I rememberd this as a great movie but the DVD has been dubbed into english. WHY? Also, the visual quality is really poor. Stay away from this DVD!"
1,"Best Movie, Worst DVD","This is probably Besson most popular film and it is hard to understand how the US market got stock with such a poor DVD. No French language sound track available, no subtitle of any kind, the aspect ratio is that of a regular TV format with no wide screen option and the quality of the transfer is so poor that you are much better off taping it on cable. A looser.Marc"
1,"Awful sound, awful dubbing","The 1997 DVD of this film is dubbed and has dreadful sound quality; if you insist on buying this film, get the 2001 release. It has the original version in widescreen, with subtitles. Get the version with blonde-haired Lambert holding a flourescent light on the cover and AVOID the other one......or avoid both of them altogether. SUBWAY is interesting only as a relic of the 1980s era, or as an early landmark in the careers of both director Luc Besson and actor Christopher Lambert, or if you're interested in seeing what Jean Reno looks like with hair. The story makes little sense... a safecracker goes underground in the Paris subway system, where he eludes a variety of pursuers, forms a rock band with subway musicians, pines for Isabelle Adjani (who is equally, and inexplicably, drawn to him), and somehow all this is Significant. SUBWAY is heavy on new wave attitude and style, but extremely light on substance."
1,The worst transfer and dubbing I've ever seen,The quality of the image and sound is as bad as can be. The original french soundtrack is not even available. Avoid at all cost !
1,ARRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,"unfortunately this great (4 star) film has been badly transferred visually, and to make things worse, on the DVD version only has the English dub, not the original french audio track. The dubbing is appalling! Why? Why? Why? Really could do better. See me after class."
1,Let down by an atrocious DVD transfer,"This is one of Luc Besson's(Leon, The Fifth Element)early films. Set almost entirely in the Paris metro underground system, it follows a punkish man named Fred(Christopher Lambert of Highlander fame). He is on the run from some corporate characters and meets the beautiful Isabelle Adjani. It is not nearly as good as Leon, but does have some style. The DVD is atrocious though. The picture has got to be the worst one ever. The transfer looks like it was taken from an old video tape with the tracking out, it really has to be seen to be believed. Also, there are no chapter times. The sound is not much better too, and is very loud, probably because it is encoded in MPEG 2 compression. There are no extras as well. An OK film is let down badly by this transfer to DVD. It is cheapish but still not worth it. The film deserves a better score than 1 star, but the DVD doesn't."
3,"Great movie, but DON'T buy the Gemstone DVD!!!!","This movie is worth seeing for the song ""It's only mystery"" all by itself. But the Gemstone Entertainment DVD that (...) is selling at the time this is written is AWFUL! The video quality isn't even as good as a decent videotape, and the English dubbing is ATTROCIOUS. Wait until an ethical outfit comes out with a real DVD: This one was made by some kids in their basement who got a DVD burner for Christmas."
2,This was the same guy that directed La Femme Nikita?,"Ok. Even though I am doing a review of the DVD, I saw the video version and it was dubbed as well. I am giving the movie an extra star just because DVD quality and subtitles usually add to the overall quality of foreign movies.I doubt it. This is a stupid movie. Christopher Lambert is trying to be hip but looks lost. Adjani is cute but she is one of those timeless beauties, and 80s fashion never worked for her. Jean Reno is usually cool. Besson did figure out how to use him properly in Nikita and The Professional. In this one he drums. THere are also plots about Subway robbers and whacky whacky homeless people who start their own 80s pop band.If you want dumb fun, watch Repo Man. Watch Repo Man over and over again. If you want a Luc Besson movie - just pretend that he didn't have a career before La Femme Nikita. It will be much better for you in the long run."
3,unambitious but pleasant,"masterful, thoughtful and perfectly executed; so why are these poems so forgettable? the needles in the haystack of plodding translations and gratuitous iconolatry are the momentary glimpses into the real: tony and the turtles, the backyard images, tomatoes ripening on vines, small moments of recognition that fill the reader with wonder at being human."
4,"Good overview, but a serious blind spot","As promised, the book does provide an overview of most ofthe Visual Basic elements a beginner might need. However,the book repeats a mistake that the examples shipped withVB 4.0 make: There is no example or discussion of how towrite an application that uses multiple forms. A chaptersubheading promises this, but it never comes up. All theexamples either take place on a single form, or use MDI."
4,delta tenoning jig,"I build one piece of furniture at a time and purchased the jig for only mortise and tenon joints. The jig was easy to set up, took only a small amount of tuning and works well. When you get it clean it up with paint thinner and add a wood backer board and you'll be in business."
3,"So, So tennoning jig","The Jig came with a ton of grease that had to be cleaned off. But to do this, I had to take the whole thing apart which was a hassle. Also had to file down to the sharp edges and sand the bottom of the jig as it would scratch my table saw surface. The stock support fence was bent and had to be hammered back into flat. After all that the jig is working fine."
4,Medium duty tennon jig,"The Delta 34-183 tennoning jig is a well machined and fitted tool. The hold down screw clamp is all it should be, superior thread fit, counter wieghted cranking, nice swivel foot. The cast iron body is ground and finished well, easy to set square, but of medium mass & wieght, although Delta has rated it as LIGHT DUTY. If you want the true ""Heavy Duty"" with a street price of about 4-1/2 times the model #34-183, I suggest you move up to the Delta model #34-172 tennoning jig, wieghing in at almost 36 lbs! HEY Tool Crib! Can you offer us the next step up, Delta model #34-72 Heavy Duty."
2,So much potential yet so little quality,"Well, I'm very disappointed with the unit for the following reasons:1. I couldn't get the vertical surface all the way square with the base without adding a shim under the locking knob travel guide. No big deal I guess, but jeez!2. I promptly rounded out the slider bolt heads and had to drill them out. Again, easy to replace, but this was pushing the limits of my patience.3. Couldn't get the slider bar parallel to the base (and therefore my blade). Upon inspection, I noticed the bore holes in the base are misaligned by as much as 1/16"". Even with the play the holes are supposed to allow for adjustment of the slider, it was not enough to compensate for the misaligned drilling pattern. I returned it for another but found the same problem with the replacement.Delta really should review there quality control. Until then, I'll avoid them.Rick"
3,Why the price changes so unexpectedly?,I ordered this yesterday at a much lower price than today's. Do you think I will feel happy about that? No way!!! What if I bought a very expensive item and find out later I could save $500 if I waited a few days? Do you think this is a way to keep customers polling your site - like scavingers? Please stop playing around and find the most reliable way to supply quality goods at lowest price.
3,cheap screws,"I like the jig but delta should have use better screws. One of the screws was already rounded out right out of the box, and while squaring it up several others rounded out."
3,Complex and not for DeWalt Table Saws,"This jig is heavy duty and has the capability of assisting you with various types tenons. There isn't much to assemble, but there are a number of ""adjustments"" that have to be made to prepare to use the jig for the first time. The instructions are adequate, but are at times confusing. Ultimately I was unable to use the jig because it wasn't deep enough to get the verticle fence all the way over to the saw blade on my Dewalt. This would have forced me to have to build up the fence in order to use the jig the way it was intended. The key message is that this is not a universal jig. It may not work in your table saw, depending upon the model you have."
3,Rigid Table Saw Owners Beware Also,"Great product, but, the Rigid Table Saw that I purchased at Home Depot has a left miter slot that is smaller than 3/4"". The result: the jig would fit in the right slot but wouldn't budge in the left. An hour with my random orbital sander made it fit. But what a hassle.The only beef I have with the jig is that it comes set up for a right tilt arbor. Most new saws are left tilt. It wasn't that difficult to change but seems like something that could be prevented if Delta would get their act together."
4,A reborn again woodworker,"Im new to use of a mortiser woodworking Jigs. And I have seen the need for a real jig, Instead of the homemade ones I used.My work setup is faster and more handy to use.Sorry I was out of a hobby I loved for so many Yrs.[All most 30 yrs]All I got to say is this Jig does what it is suppose to do and more. It gives you piece of mind that that the job will be right."
2,DELTA 34-183 IS NOT WORTH IT,The base plate of the jig rubbed againt the surface of table saw result in black mark which smear all over your wood. The scale on the jig is very crude. You better off with a homade jig which is cheaper and more accurate.
4,very good but not great,"as far as funtion this this is great.very acurate tenons and easy to adjust, but...Delta please stop making plastic knobs and handlesi buy a tool and expect it to last for a very long time and plastic is not allways the best for knobs.allthough i havent broke any of them yet."
1,Be Careful!,I have a Delta bench saw and I wanted to tenoning work so by mistake I ordered this jig(34-183). It fits table saws not bench saws! Now I am trying to fit it to my bench saw-don't know whether I'll accomplish this modification.
3,good but....,"Good quality accesory but, I did have to file the casting square where the vertical backstop tightening handle meets the casting. If I didn't do this the backstop wouldn't stay square when the stop is tightened at 90 degrees. Kind of annoyed me when I have been very satisfied with Delta products in the past.I wrote to Delta telling them of this design flaw, haven't anything back as yet."
5,Daughter Dina has inherited her mother's powers,"Caution: The Shamer's Daughter is Book 1 of a series. That said, The Shamer's Daughter is an engrossing introduction to the concept of The Shamer, who has the power to unmask the soul's secrets and crimes. Daughter Dina has inherited her mother's powers and unfortunately can tell her childhood friends are now her enemies. Her involvement in a murder puzzle leads to a newfound appreciation for her resented skills"
5,What would you do if no one looked you in the eye willingly again?,"Set in a fairytale Scotland, The Shamer's Daughter was refreshing and intense. The main character, only a 12 year old girl, is forced to grow up when she inherits her mother's gift of ""shaming."" That is, the gift of mirroring the soul of the person who looks you in the eye. Although not touched on overly much in this first installment, the reader can't help but feel how Dina feels when no one looks her in the eye. It's easy enough to transfer that over to my own sensibilities and how hurt I would be if everyone I came across was scared to look me in the eye.There is of course the generic evil overlord who denounces ""Shaming"" as witchcraft when he cannot get his way, as well as keeping pet dragons (they're really quite nasty!) I was very impressed with this first book, I can't wait to read all of the other ones!"
5,Victory - An Excellent Read,"Victory by Joseph Conrad is a novel well worth reading. However, it was not an easy book for me to read.Joseph Conrad writes with great insight into the characters he creates and I personally have found his characterisations very confronting, rarely less so than in Victory.The central characters in this novel are not particularly nice people, with one or two exceptions. Some are quite nasty. And Conrad doesn't give us an insipid ending. It has the ring of truth about it.Difficult though it can be to read through, it is well worth following through to the end and I would recommend it to anyone who is prepared to be personally challenged."
3,VICTORY,I thought I would like his wirk more based on reading another of his strues last summer. This was just ok.
1,disgusting editi,A marvelous novel in a practically unreadable edition. Buying the book was a waste of money. The print is tiny and the margins narrow. After the book arrived I went to the Strand bookstore and bought an excellent Penguin paperback edition for $5.
5,Great Story!,"Joseph Conrad has long been one of my favorite authors. His works can be difficult to understand, with all the shades of meanings and the complicated plots, but Conrad's novels have always been worth the effort. Victory was one of the more readable works; and one of the most spell-binding. A great story by a great author: I'm very glad I read this!"
1,Book Disappoindtment,"I was disappointed in the copy of VICTORY I received. It was in new, excellent condition and came promptly. No complaintds there. It was a very odd edition, though. It almost seemed as if had been typed and zeroxed.A very odd and unusual shape, too. Conrad deserves better. It was brand new but a off beat publisher. I am still looking for the Moderen Libraryk edition. Sincerely."
3,A mixed bag,"The opening history is informative, interesting and useful. One learns much about Aristotle's conception of the infinite; Cantor's rival conception and the numerous positions between them. There are helpful and helpfully brief explanations of ordinals, the LS theorem and the Goedel results. However, the parts of the book in which the author presents his own positive view are a mixed bag: this reader found them to be only partially illuminating and highly repetitive. One wants to know much more about what it is to be ""shown"" something which, when one tries to say it, is strictly speaking false--and mere invocations of Wittgenstein aren't all that helpful here. One wonders whether the author really knew what he meant by this idea. I found the repetitive final chapters dragged, and in places bordered on the tedious."
4,Great book.,I really enjoyed this book. It was hot and sexy and the characters were interesting and likeable. Tykota was an honorable guy that was torn between the woman he loves and his duty to his people. the Heroine (Makinna) Falls for Tykota after he rescues her from an indain attack. She is strong and likeable character that you can't help but care about. I recommend this book to anyone that likes indain romances or anyone that just wants a great read!
3,Decent,Well written with a real heart after God. He speaks to many of the problems men face today. My complaint would be to have more references to the bible.
5,"Totally absorbing, emotionally affecting, subtly written.","This book hit me hard. It is ironic that I must use a cliche to describe the book, since the author never used one, but I laughted and cried. There are little miracles in this book that are understated, so that one's emotions catch one unawares! I heartily recommend this novel to both men and women."
1,It is unbelievably how terrible this book is,"Despite all the not-so-subtle rhetoric laced on every adjective addled sentence, this book is awful. The characters are thin and obvious; the events are staged and the narrative structure is no better than a high schooler's creative writing project. The latter would probably be more creative, still. If you are looking to fulfill your political-literary needs or need to feel better about your views, read some nonfiction psychobabble by some other lunatic, possibly the author herself. If this book teaches anything, it is to know your place! So, bad journalists should know their place and not try to move into fiction (there are enough bad writers) just because conservative publishing is currently marketable and will make them a buck they don't need."
2,This Book Lacks Depth,"I was extremely excited about reading this book after reading several favorable reviews. I came to discover that this book was painful to get through, lacking depth to the characters, and concluded on a ""happily ever after"" note that was ill-fitting to the rest of the book. I wouldn't recommend this book at all to anyone- don't waste your money or time trying to read this. It does not get better as you progress."
3,Your own choices will reflect in your opinion of this book,"Amanda Bright made her choice to stay at home to raise their two kids Ben and Sophie. Her husband Bob works for the Department of Justice. Bob gets on a case of a lifetime but things seem to innocuously fall apart for him; Amanda; and their marriage. Amanda has trouble at times keeping her sanity when the kids are screaming, the house is a mess, and there's shopping to be done. Amanda struggles with supporting her husband and deciding whether to go back to work. An emergency helps Bob and Amanda re-assess and figure out what's important for their family. The characters were bothersome because they were too much a caricature. Bob's big case lacked for originality. Her various friendships were fake and unrealistic. Her mother was the case study on everything negative about motherhood. Witty at times but tries too much to make a statement."
3,Why not the 'burbs?,"Crittendon excels at describing some of the emotions and situations that come with motherhood and home life. She doesn't have easy answers, which is fine. It's an entertaining novel. I found it amusing that Amanda wouldn't even consider moving to the suburbs. The DC suburbs are full of intelligent and compassionate people, even in - gasp - Rockville. The schools are good too. Why should Amanda live in Woodley Park anyway if she needs a map to find her way around the zoo?"
3,I Really Wanted To Love It.....,"but I didn't. I was on the waiting list at the library for this book for over a month. When it was finally my turn I was so excited. I was really hoping that I would be able to identify with this book. I am a work from home mom. I was hoping to get some insight into how other stay at home moms feel. I was looking for a book that I would get sucked into because I could relate to it. Not true for this book. I tried and tried to keep reading, but I was bored. There was too much talk about the law case that Amanda's husband was working on. There was too much talk about what everyone else was doing. I wanted to know what Amanda was doing, how Amanda was feeling. I wanted a book that truly explained what it feels like to be a stay at home mom and have an actual life. I was disappointed."
2,the subject had promise but the book fell short,I really looked forward to reading this book. It was a disappointment. The characters had no depth and were stereotypical. It was poorly writen. There were errors in the timelines. It was a subject that was really interesting. I wish it had been a realistic veiw of life as a stay at home mom.
4,I actually liked this,"I was suprised when I came to this site and saw that so many people did not like this book.As a new mom, I found myself agreeing with a lot of Amanda's thoughts. I was releived to know that there are other's out there struggling with the same issues as me, even if it is only in a novel.The book helped me understand myself a little more, and was a great way to relax and ""escape"" while on my lunch break at work."
5,"Insightful for all sick of modern ""life"".","Crittenden shows the real life of a woman who valiantly decides to go home and be a mother. One could expect some sweet tale of perpetual fulfillment with only slight, ideological battles from this conservative writer. But, no. Actually it shows what happens when the ooze of pride and warmth of a new experience wear off and this educated woman, with an active mind, realizes her life is now car-pools and diapers. Although one has to pay attention, practical applications of ideology pop up everywhere. A great moment is when Grandma Bright (a hard-core feminist from the old days) brings the children gifts. Gifts that would make Gloria Allred proud: for the toddler girl, Sophie, it's a bulldozer, for the kindergarten age Ben, a sand painting kit. The children within seconds trade gifts, thus restoring that natural order.An easy read that all, especially husbands who think they know what it's like for stay-at-home moms, should try."
3,move over Crittenden - you are NO Pearson!,"I was so looking forward to this book. ...and thought this looked like an American version on a theme. Don't be fooled!This story is about Amanda Bright who has 2 children, Ben and Sophie, and married to Bob, who the story really is about. I found Amanda's friends to be fakes and curious why she kept in the same circles with them.If you think this book, as marketed in my opinion, is about a stay at home mom, then think again. It's about Bob, Amanda's husband and his job. The children are thrown in here and there and one is portrayed as violent and never fully explained why so. Amanda yells at her kids and acts like they are always in the way; she wonders constantly if she should go back to work.The cover is attractive and so is the summary on the back - but pass this one up!"
1,The cover suckered me in,What a complete waste of my time. I'm a working mother of two. The description on the back made it seem as if this woman was me. She is so far from anyone I know. I don't like her. I can't understand how she can't make any worthwhile friends. The ending was ridiculous and contrived. Whole book was an utter letdown.
1,Good material to line your birdcage with,"God, I hated this book. As a working mother of three who lives in the DC area, I had hoped to be able to relate to ""Amanda"" or at least some of her friends. Instead, I found myself irritated by the author's thinly-veiled political agenda and her disdain for feminism, liberal democrats, and children with peanut allergies. Moreover, Crittenden is a terrible writer. Ugh. Avoid at all costs and seek out the far more witty ""I Don't Know How She Does It""."
4,They can dish it out . . .,"The negative reviews I've read here prove Danielle Crittenden's point precisely: that there really ARE such incredibly pretentious people as Amanda's friends and the staff at her kids' school, that they are deadly serious about what they are doing, and that they find it perfectly OK to ridicule conservatives, pro-lifers, and evangelical Christians but can't take the heat themselves.The bit about Ben's peanut butter cookie transgression had me rolling, and I hope Amanda's friend Liz in onto something with her embrace of ""motherhood feminism."" Only time will tell.People, this is called SATIRE, and this book ranks up there among the most deliciously nasty one of the conservative variety since Tom Wolfe's ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" and Cyra McFadden's ""The Serial: A Year in the Life of Marin County."""
1,Yawn,"I'm sorry, this book was too boring for me to continue. The spineless main character seems to hang around with vapid women hung up on material wealth and facelifts at the ripe old age of 40! Ha! Amanda is ""deeply conflicted"" about her role as stay at home mother - yeah, we get it, we get it - do we have to be reminded every other page? Why doesn't she get some new friends? Why doesn't she grow a backbone? Why was I reading this book?!?!?!?"
5,I love this book!!!!,"This book is for every ex-professional mom who ever felt invisible at a party!! Nothing in today's education, professional or media environment really prepares the modern woman for being a wife, mother, and homemaker, and it is no wonder that novice Amanda is confused and occasionally self-pitying. What saves her ultimately is her great sense of humor and deep love for her husband and children. This is a laugh-out-loud funny book to be thoroughly enjoyed by the pool, ocean, or after the kids are in bed. At the same time, there are scenes that will move you to tears. But whether laughing or crying, there are countless scenes where any mom will see herself. I don't care about the author's politics. I just care about a great read I can relate to. And this is it!!"
1,A marketer's dream,"Without knowing much about this author I'd say it was written by a shrewd marketer with good connections. So kudos to Ms. Crittenden's notion of herself, and her ability to convince others that she has talent.Sadly, this novel's self-conscious laughs are as painful as the title. It makes me wonder where Ms. Crittenden went to college. Did she ever learn about critical thinking? Or is it all about who you know?How Ms. Crittenden got a contract with the Wall Street Journal is as curious to me as how she was able to fanagle her way onto NPR to tell America that we should be nice to mothers struggling with strollers in Starbucks."
