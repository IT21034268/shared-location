2,Poorly done!,"Nothing but a commercialized grouping of so-called ""hits."" The recording itself is poorly done with little thought to overall sonic quality."
3,It's no Mosaique,"I chose this CD to expand my GK collection and was disappointed. Many of the cuts can be found on Mosaique and I wasn't moved by the others. If you're a first-time GK listener or looking to add to your existing collection, buy Mosaique. It is an excellent representation of the remarkable work of this group."
5,Love this music,Many good memories from the 90s. xxx xxx xxx xxx xx xx xxxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx x
3,Gipsy,I'm not the best judge of this music. It is good in it's genre but other than that I am not a fan.
4,energy for 6 hours,"This is a good combo of herbs that don't give jitters,but gives you sustained energy."
4,tyrone powell as brigham young,"the story is a testimony to the latter day saints and the flight to salt lake city utah. how they struggled , but persued on to their goalA+++++"
2,"Nice story, but historically off base.","When I first saw this movie on the shelf at our local video store, I had to see it. Being a mormon myself and an LDS Church history buff, I had to see how Hollywood depicted my ancestors. The basic plot to the story is correct. The mormons were driven out of Nauvoo, Il., by angry and violent mobs, but the rest of the story is lacking in any real historical basis. Nice to see Hollywood recognizing a true and potentially a good American story to tell, I just wish they could get the facts straight."
2,Note to Tyrone Power fans:,"While the movie is interesting, if you are a Tyrone Power or Vincent Price fan - They are barely in it."
4,great - I enjoyed it.,"I've enjoyed the movie with tyrone power, since he was one of my favorate actors in those early years. It's a great story about aman - but see it for yourself I can only recommend it."
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"So I got this screen protector because I've heard so many good things about it. First of all this flimsy piece of sticky paper is not that sticky at all. Post-Its would have more stickiness. Second of all, it is cheap, BUT NOT EFFECTIVE. I've just had it for half a day and this so called ""protector"" comes right off at the corners with a couple of ins and outs. Last but not least, it looks worn out! I thought I ordered it fudging new and it looks like it has been used several times... And trust me, the mirror looks nothing like the display picture. Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone. Horrible, horrible protector."
4,Niiice,"I'm pretty surprised on how clear the mirror looks. My phone looks great w/it!! I do have to admit though, I got a few tiny air bubbles!! I was ever so careful too! :( But it's barely noticeable!!! I love how my phone looks!"
3,Don't believe the picture,"It looks good in the pictures, but not in real life. The reflection is like one you might get from a plastic play mirror. If the plastic is torn or has bubbles, it warps the reflection. I'm considering buying another one, since mine is now torn. But only because it protects my screen."
2,"It looks good, wish it last","Well when I first put it on it stick just fine but a month later the mirror screen lifts up at the ends. But it looks good, like an actually mirror just doesnt last long."
3,Long and Tedious,"The first half is very long... Lots of smaller plots within the main story. Mostly post-cold war politcs. Not really that interesting.The author was barely able to maintain my interest. Too much time is spent explaining what each character is thinking and what they are thinking the other character is thinking....I kept reading because I wanted to find out what happened to the sub in the first place and who was going to end up with the plutonium.Anyway, this is not the action book that the back cover claims."
1,"Don't bother, just get the top tap for your cans","This worked one time, second use the seal slipt in half causing the entire can to leak out. I returned it for a refund"
2,Simple design and terrible seal,The premise behind these is great and I had an old set from a different mfg years ago. These however wouldn't make a good seal unless I actually held pressure on the thing (R134a). Used them on 4 cans and each one required me to hold them tight to ensure I wasn't leaking by the seal....
2,Could be better,"The can tap worked exactly as it was supposed to but after just 4 times, the rubber seal split resulting in messy leaks. Now i need to source a seal for it or make one. Would have been good if it had come with a spare. Best if used near the bottom or top of can."
4,Great Product!,"Only gave four stars because it is, after all, an INHALER!! Ha ha. This is a great product. I'm using doTERRA Breathe in one and DigestZen in another. The Breathe is for use prior to nasal lavage. The DigestZen is a travel therapy for motion sickness. Thanks for the quality product. (VENDOR: Shipping is high -- consider becoming Prime eligible!)."
2,unsatisfying,"to tell the truth i was dissapointed in in this book. voigts stories are always long and drawn out but this was too much. oriel's character seemed cold and cruel, and hardly anything was done with griffs character. as for the plot it was sketchy and unbelievable."
1,Does the author have any creativity?,"I give this book a bad rating not because I didn't like it but because of it's lack of something new and fresh. I have only read one other book by this authoress, On Fortune's Wheel and it seems to contain the same characters as this one and the same background for the herines as in Jackaroo. Does this author have any different ideas other than these?"
1,Does the author have any creativity?,"I have only read one book by this authoress, On Fortune's Wheel and it seems to contain the same characters as this one and the same background for the herines as in Jackaroo. Does this author have any different ideas other than these?"
5,AMAZING!,"This is one of my favorite books of all time. I read this book awhile ago and I still put myself in the main character's place. It's amazing in how Griff (the main character's best friend) and the boy with no name (later Oriel) escapes to only find that it is no better anywhere. I loved this book, and I strongly recomend reading the other books in the series. Those are Jackaroo, and On Fortune's Wheel. Even though The Wings of a Falcon is long, I didn't regret getting the book when I was in the middle. This is a hard-to-put-down book, though maybe boring for a few pages pages, but then it is exciting again. It is 467 pages, and 31 chapters, but it only took me 5 days to read it. That is really how exciting it is."
5,The Wings of a Falcon Fly Away,"Dear Reader,The book The Wings Of a Falcon one of my favorite books. When I saw the title I knew had to have this book. The two main characters are Oriel and Griff. One is the servant of the other.(I won't tell you who because you'll have to read it to find out.) It is a story of pride, loyalty, bravery, and romance(not to much though). The story is well written. I have found it's part of a series but I haven't read the other parts of the series yet.Nile"
4,One Flaw,"The book was great, but it had one little BIG flaw: I do NOT by any means want to give away secrets so: It was a great book exept for one thing, The main character Oriel, was a great (cute) character, a little conceided though. But I'll only give one small hint: I'll ... Tintage myself, I will!!!!! There! read the book and find out more yourself!!! About: The Dammal's island, The great escpe, Their journeys on the mainland, The Kingdome, and, The Wings Of A Falcon."
4,A must-read.,"I thought that this was a very well written story with compelling characters and a lot of detail to boot. The only major flaws with this book were the legnth and the plot twists. Every time the characters settled down, they were forced to move again. This got a little bland and predictable after a while. The characters were very well done, although Griff could have used a little more time in the spot-light. This is a great book for anyone with plenty of time on their hands. It's a wonderful story, but unfortunately it is long."
4,GET HOOKED WITH WINGS OF A FALCON,"this book was pretty great! Even though it was a little challenging, I GOT MOST OF IT. It had so many details about how the two boys ran away from Dammal island, and lived in many different cities. I thought it was a great fantasy book, since the author put Mad Maggy in it. It really inspired me... BUT READ IT- YOU'LL LOVE IT!"
4,Great,"There aren't many books that I have read that I wouldn't give five stars. The reason I gave this book five stars is not because of the plot twist, but because of the lose ends that never really got tied up. I mean what was the point of having the innkeeper be a woman? We never did find out what happened to tamara of the salt weller or to the people on Damalls island. I don't know maybe we will find out in the next book, but anyway I think she should have told us a little more about what happened to characters. About the plot twist, I acually really liked it. I have never read a book that had something like that in it. Some people say that they didn't like it because they were so attached to Oriel. I never did like Oriel too much. He was always thinking that he was the best. I wasn't at all sad when it happened. (I won't say what happened for those who haven't read it.) Even thought I only gave this book four stars it is a great book and I highly recommened it."
2,Save your $$$,"This product is too salty and has too much preservative. Just get your smoked product at your local fresh fish store, or in the refrigerated section of your favotite grocer!"
3,Not Just Half of Half and Half,"I really like Karen Voight and have most of her workouts. I was thrilled to see this workout and the Calorie Burn come out. But, I sure wish I could swap both of them for the original Half and Half workout. Neither of the new work outs have a warm up or cool down. When you turn the DVD on it simply jumps right into the workout without warning. I was so surprised because Karen's workouts are some of the best chaptered DVD's that I have. I can live without the warm up (although it would have been nice to have SOME kind of lead in to the workout), but I would have really liked for the upper body and lower body segments to be chaptered.So if you are interested in both the strength and cardio sections, just buy the original Half and Half. You'll get more for your money!"
3,pretty good,"This is an okay workout DVD. Her personality and teaching style is a little blah, but the workout is okay. I prefer Jari Love's workout DVD's by far."
5,The courage of conscience,"Shared Sorrows is a breath-taking, exquisite book. Sonneman's quest begins as a personal one, revealing her courage in asking what happened to the Gypsies in the Holocaust, as she had earlier understood her own Jewish family's fate. I was awed by her conscience and courage in listening and recording the heart-rending replies. The truthful, brutal answers left tear stains on more than one page as I read. But Sonneman's reporter's voice and writer's heart were precisely what allowed me to face all that she heard. She brings her readers into a universe of unspeakable memories because we must all remember. And she shows us that we must honor these memories because the universe is still capable of love and luck and -- always -- conscience. It is a powerful and important book no reader will soon forget."
2,The authors account of events in Somalia,"Major Stanton captures many items in this personal account of what happened to the 2/87th Infantry in Somalia.There were many people involved in Restore Hope and Major Stanton provides insight into a tiny slice of those lives. through the day to day events as seen by the command group without much exaggeration. This book would be well served with the blanks being filled in by the company commanders and first sergeants of the line companies that actually performed the operations, cordons and searches, and riot control situations described, not to mention the hours of patrolling, and waiting.It is interesting to note that in the recommended book lists ""Black Hawk Down"" the author vilifies the 10th Mountain Division and portrays the Rangers in a rather inaccurate light. Stanton's book is by far the most accurate account of the US involvement in Somalia to date."
1,Somalia on Five Dollars a Day,"To make this short and sweet.....If you were, are in, the Armed Service and like to use letters for everything you do, then this is the book for you. If you want an exciting book about our Service Men in Somalia try ""Black Hawk Down"". That, is an exciting book.....this one is lower that a 1 Star. The best part of the book is the second to the last chapter when they leave Solamia. The rest...."
5,Great,These were better than any other vanilla bean I have tried. I will order again. The price was also great.
4,Great,"Fast delivery, item was as advertised, did seem to be not at the peak of freshness, like others I bought on-line, but not far from it, might have been the method of delivery and the heat that effected the freshness, have no problem order more from the same supplier."
1,Very old beans with NO flavor,Theses beans were so old they had absolutely no flavor not even a slight aromaI was very very disappointed. Save your money
5,Good quality; good deal,"My grocery store sells a bottle with 1 vanilla bean rattling against the glass for $14.95. These beans were really beans--soft, flexible, and fresh--unlike many vanilla beans that are closer to being sticks. I immediately put one of these beans in the vodka base for my own vanilla extract and the color and fragance were recognizably vanilla extract in half an hour. Normally, the process takes about 3 months, but at this rate the extract will be ready to use in a couple weeks. Prompt shipping."
2,Broke on 3rd Time Out,"When I first received this scope in December 2011, it functioned adequately. The color quality was not good but clearness of the image was sufficient to see individual hits on the target at 50 yards. I could just make out individual hits at 100 yards on other targets. It met my basic need viewing targets at the range and was acceptable for the price. On my third trip out in July 2012, the objective lens retaining ring (made of plastic) broke allowing the objective lens to pop out of the tube. I did not expect a brilliant image from this scope, but I did not expect it to break so easily."
2,Expected much better,No where near the power that was advertised. I expected much better. Could barely make out marks on target at 75 yard. disappointed
3,Good little movie,"If you like these types of movies, you will not regret this one.Its really pretty good, has a story and characters that youwill love/hate. The effects are decent and if you ever saw a swarmfly buy, it will bring back some memories when you see the swarmsflying in the movie which makes the movie even better.The only problem is with the lame ending...but heck you cantwin them all. Give it a shot...."
4,A solid TV movie,This is yet another fine made for tv movie. Ok the genre is certainly not new but it also never gets old either.A couple of genecticall engineered wasps escape from a research lab and threaten the well being of an entire town which just happens to have a major event just around the corner. As bodies pill up Two scientist and a professional bug man must stop this deadly swarm before things get worse.Throw in the greedy police chief and an ambitious and also greedy mayor and you have a very good film .I recommend this.
4,Very nice device. Easy to use.,"My belay device of choice is Black Diamond's ATC Guide. But sometimes an auto-assist belay device is nice. I never warmed up to the Gri-Gri because of it's size, and because it's correct use is a very unnatural movement. The Gri-Gri II didn't seem to improve the movement part of that equation. Eventually I ran across the Cinch and found it as easy and natural to use as my ATC Guide. After a year or so of use, I still like it very much. I'd prefer it have a slightly bigger 'sweet spot' for lowering a climber; but that is more a minor annoyance than a safety issue. As a mechanical designer, I'm extremely impressed at what a positive catch this device provides utilizing such a straight rope line. To see how easy this thing is to use, watch the video on Trango's home page: [...]"
5,Favorite Play Time,"The hyperdog launcher is my yellow lab's favorite play toy. This is great exercise for after work during the week when we do not have alot of time to run. Just say the word ""Hyperball"" and Rusty goes crazy. The shipping was fast, the item was here within a few days."
1,I can throw the ball further without it,"I am a 60 yo female and can't throw a ball very far at all. After reading all the rave reviews, I got a Hyperdog. What a disappointment. I can throw the enclosed balls further with my hand than with this thing. After having several male friends try it for me, we decided the rubber tubing provided is too stretchy and weak. Off to the store to get the stronger rubber tubing used with hunting slingshots to see if that helps.UPDATE: Hunting slingshot rubber tubing works! Also got 2 replacement Chuckit's hard rubber balls that bounce, which also helps. Hyperdog - take note. Upgrade your product before someone else does!"
3,Make sure your in good shape,I have a torn shoulder so I couldn't use it. You need to be fairly strong and in fair shape so if your an old man like me don't buy it.
1,DANGEROUS PRODUCT,BANDS WILL BREAK AFTER ONLY A FEW TIMES. OUCH ! PUT A DANDY WELT ON MY NECK. PRODUCT SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM SHELVES.
5,Tree topper,I purchased this product to shoot a string over limbs in my trees that are just waiting to fall on someone or something. I then retreive a larger rope to pull the limb down. It works great.
5,Happy Dog,Our 10 month old English Springer Spaniel was wearing out my arm throwing balls. Not ANY MORE!!!I use this 3 times a day 5 days a week. With this I can shoot a ball further that I can throw one. It takes a little practice to get the hang of it. For me it does a good job. Now if only I can find Springer proof tennis balls I'd be all set!
4,Shooting dogs,My lab and I love this thing. She gets so excited when I get it out of the car. I hurt my arm a while back and jsut can't through like I use to and this thing more than makes up for it.
2,"Good, idea, bad quality","When it works, it works well, but the bungee broke about 12-15 shots after I first tried it. I reattached the shortened bungee, and it broke again after about 20 shots. Then I put the new replacement bungee/pocket on, and it broke after only the second time I used it. I'm not pulling it back too far, either. The rubber used in these bungees is junk."
3,Nicely done,I bought this by mistake but now I will buy the game.I know there is a lot I can learn and the game sounds like fun.
3,coat,"was not the quality that I expected,, or what the picture made it look to be. my son was disappointed in it."
2,Hat ran small coat ran large,I ordered it for my 4 almost 5 year old he loves it but it was a little bothersome b/c the coat was too long he kept stepping on it causing it to tear at the shoulders.
5,A beautiful book!,"This is fascinating book about the life of Botticelli and techniques he used. The reproductions are wonderful, including some close-ups of characters from selected paintings. I recently returned from Italy, and having viewed many of these paintings at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence makes the reading and the beautiful color plates throughout the book all the more enjoyable. I would highly recommend this book to fans of Renaissance art."
5,Breath-takingly beautiful,"For the same reasons already stated by those who have given it a five-star rating. I love looking through it over and over. I did an Artist study with my son, as part of our homeschool curriculum; Botticelli was one of them. The techniques he used never ceases to amaze me."
5,A compilation that reprints his previous titles,"Written by foremost sasquatch authority John Green, who has studied the legend for more than 40 years and assembled more than 4000 reports, The Best of Sasquatch Bigfoot is a compilation that reprents his previous titles ""On the Track of the Sasquatch"" and ""Encounters with Bigfoot"" along with 16 pages of brand new material. Black-and-white photographs, maps, extensive reports of amazing incidents, and just about every possible speculation concerning the mysterious Bigfoot packs this anthology, which is neatly supplemented with an alphabetical index for quick lookup. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in exploring the mystery behind this wildly popular legend."
1,Piece of Junk!,"Total piece of junk!Never used once, put in trash!Nothing right with this product!I would give zero stars if I could!"
1,Piece of junk is right,"The whole thing is flimsy plastic, including the mirror. You twist it to adjust the magnification. The first time I did that, I twisted it too far and it popped apart. I couldn't get it back together. Don't bother with this one."
4,High quality but requires fogless spray.,"The construction of the mirror is great. The suction cups keep in in place without issue. The fogless quality however is a bit questionable. It works good when used with the fogless spray, but without spray, it fogs up like any other mirror. The mirror needs to be sprayed with fogless spray every time it is used in order to keep it clear."
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this product as a Christmas present. It arrived promptly, however, the mirror was floating loosely in the box; unattached to the frame. The mirror was also warped so I sent it back to the seller.(J&R Music) They provided me with a refund once they received it (less the postage). Overall I was not impressed by the quality, and would avoid purchasing anything made by Zadro again."
1,Trash From The Start,This is the worst purchase I have made from Amazon. Usually these mirrors wait a few months until they go bad this one waited a few days. Do not buy this piece of garbage. This is not just a shoddy product but theft.
1,Never received product,"One star for vendor ? for product. I placed my order over a month ago and not until 3 days ago did I get an e-mail stating that my order will not be placed. And without any explanation of why. This is the pitfalls of internet shopping. I found ""the original fogless mirror"" for only $15 elsewhere instead."
5,Great mirror.,"I bought this mirror some time ago and have used it everyday since. It's well made, the mirror has stayed clear and sharp, and the suctioncups work perfectly. Mine has only been attached by two of the three cups but has never shifted or fallen. It's a fine product that I have no reservations about recomending."
3,Still foggy,"I like how clear the mirror is, how easy it is to hang and the way that it stays put even if you bump it, but it is foggy after I run the water for even two minutes. Needs to be more ""fogless"" if it's going to use it in its name."
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed to see a cheap looking mirror when I opened the box. The mirror was made of cheap a plastic. The reflected image (my face...) was totally distorted. The supplied 2-sided sticker could not hold the mirror on the tiles and I had to use RTV in order to attach it to the shower wall. After couple of weeks the ""fogless"" mirror became covered with fog the moment I opened the hot water in the shower. The whole mirror surface became quite ""matte"" after some time, and ""mirror stains"" (or peelings) appeared on the mirror edges and the plastic holder.Why 2 start and not 1? - Because for over 2 years I am spraying anti-fog spray on the mirror before I start shaving, and so I manage to do the job. But now I had it, and I am looking for a different mirror."
1,Piece of Junk,"I haven't even had it hanging for 24 hours and the thing is falling apart. What you may not realize is that the mirror is held to the frame by a sticker!!! Problem is the sticker does not stick. Only good thing is that the suction cups hold nicely to the wall...however, that does not do you much good when the mirror keeps falling to the ground. Don't waste your money."
1,G Bernz,the manufacture only gives a 30 day guarantee on this. My mirrow fell out after 60 days. The double face tape did not hold. Do not buy.
1,Zadro Mirror Broke Immediately - SAVE YOUR BOX,"I'm not one of those types who writes terrible reviews for fun and picks apart the tiniest insignificant details of every product. But this product absolutely fell apart, so I can't help but warn others! First of all, unless you have a perfectly smooth, plastic shower surround, the suction cups will never work. I have a smooth tile shower and they don't even work on mine. So I bought this mirror because it was one of the few that came with this ""waterproof"" sticky tape. That fell off too. I finally just bought some Gorilla glue and that held the mirror to the wall. Then a few days later, the mirror itself came unstuck from the frame. And guess what! It was just more of this waterproof tape holding the mirror on. No wonder it failed. Because this was a Christmas gift and the box was thrown out on Christmas day, I couldn't get a refund from J&R. They're sending me a replacement, which I'm hoping will not fall apart as well."
4,Met All My Expectations,"I researched several Fogless mirrors on Amazon before deciding on this one. I went with this one based mostly on the positive reviews. I have had this mirror now for several months and can say that it does what I expected. It does not fog up very easily. When it does I just splash some water on the mirror and the problem is solved. The suction cups work sufficiently enough, but the mirror will fall if I do not reapply pressure to the suctions every two weeks or so. This hasn't really been that big of a nuisance as I am in the shower more often than that. The first time gave me a real start, though, as it came crashing down in the middle of night while I was sleeping. They do provide a sticky patch alternative with the packaging if you so choose to use it.Overall, pleased with the product. Really enjoy having a mirror in the shower. I would definitely purchase this same product again. Although, maybe next time I will buy a model with a light built in."
2,It lasted for nearly 4 months...,"I bought this product a while back, but hadn't written a review until purchasing the toilet tree fogless mirror which is awesome. Don't waste your time with this product considering their are better products at cheaper prices."
4,Perfect!,"I bought my first one for my office. Liked it so much I bought another one to take home. The microphone plug is directly in front. The CD records to the tape player. The only thing I don't care for is the presets are named Pop, Rock and Jazz (or something like that)rather than #1, #2 and #3. What if I only like talk radio, country and gospel?? /Other than that annoyingly trivial pitfall, it works great ... including the remote control."
2,Don't let the attractive cover influence you,"The attractive, well assembled cover masks a very poor product.Poor sound quality.7/8 of the whole series is rambling about something irrelevant.I think I got 2 good messages from this whole product.I'm not saying don't buy it, but purchase it in a way which will allow you to get a refund."
3,I was disappointed,"I read it, it was ok. But it felt like I read this book before just pieces taken from different books. I agree that Foley could do better than this. Some parts of the book I liked but it wasn't enough to be endearing to me."
5,This goes on the Keeper Shelf!,This book was awesome. It was so well written and well rounded.I figure by the time you read this review you probably have a good idea what the book is about so I am going to give only my impressions on this wonderful book!None of the scenes came off as cut short. The ending was complete and satisfying. The romance was breath taking. Seeing others get there due was just flat out satisfying. The detail and setting was vivid without drowning in it.This book is apart of an excellent series that only gets better with each book that Gaelen publishes. Her characters are sexy but not flawless. Her heroines are smart but not mousie or too perfect. And the bad guys make you want to chew your freaking nails off.I truly cannot wait to read the next book in this series!
4,Not Quite Up to Par,"Gaelen Foley always delivers a sound romance read, but she falls a little short of perfection with her latest, Devil Takes a Bride. The characters are, per usual, vivid, with moving backgrounds. The plot falls victim to a bit of premature capitulation, with the hero and heroine getting together very early in the book, both in love. The subplot sags a bit in the middle, featuring Foley's bizarre predilection for characters with abnormal sexual activities (ie child molestors and rapists). Overall, the romance is strong, the intrigue slightly weak. (And am I the only reader who wanted Lizzie to get together with Alec?)"
2,A disappointment.,"Foley's other books in this series had strong heroes with black backgrounds, believable heroines, and interesting settings that went outside the typical London society setting. Foley is great at drawing you into a scene or situation with vivid descriptions.But in Devil, Foley disappoints by dropping the heroine willingly into the hero's lap on day one (after spending pages explaining the woman's determination to never trust or love a man again). The hero's degree of guilt for something over which he had no control is silly. So is her saccharine sweet goodness, alternating self-reliance and helplessness, and too-even temper. You know early on that she's won him with her goodness, and that he'll come around as soon as he finishes his little revenge project. Their problems aren't troubling enough to justify the elaborate situations they have to overcome to end up together, and so neither is the happy ending."
4,Devil Take a Bride,"Great romance novel. *A warning to anyone high brow about their Romance.* If you love Balogh or Heyer because of their great, authentic 19th century dialogue and historical accuracy, this author might not be for you. I'd recommend getting this from the library first if this is you.This book is a great, romantic and funny, heart-wrenching romance novel but the dialogue is simplistic and 20th century (slang and all) and the situations are definitely contrived. Totally a typical ""bodice-ripper"", with throbbing members and heaving bosoms, but the romance is just so sweet and even though the dialogue is modern, it's still witty and the historical details are well researched and slipped in nicely throughout the book. It might not be your cup of tea, but I enjoyed it and I'm not afraid to say I like the occasional bodice ripper."
4,A dreadfully wonderful book.,"As always, I love Foley's books. I love the fact that there is a history with each character, and that I'm able to follow along and truly come to love each character. Devil Takes a Bride had murder, intrigue, and best of all, love. However, I was disapointed with how Alec came across in this book, because he was always one of my favorites. I suppose when I read the other books, I expected him to come to his senses and marry Lizzy. Obviously, that book set all my expectations to rest, but still-- didn't anyone else expect Alec and Lizzy to be together? No one else seems surprised, so I guess not."
2,Would have been higher but,"the book simply fell far short of its potential at the end. Which is ok most of the time because not every book an author writes is stellar. In this case, however, things fell apart. A man pointed a gun at someone and yelled ""Freeze!"". Freeze? In REGENCY ENGLAND? I'm sorry, that's a no-no. It totally destroyed the atmosphere of the book and the whole thing turned into a Dirty Harry movie for me from there on out. Come on, Gaelen, you can do better than that. That one line ruined the book for me.I expect better from the next book."
3,"Good story, needs research","I realize that most people reading this book will not care one way or the other, but I have a few minor quibbles. Five minutes' research would have told the author a few things: ""A few policemen were on hand to clear the way to the Abbey."" In 1817 there were no policemen in London, except for the River Police. ""The...line of coaches stretched nearly to Trafalgar Square."" No Trafalgar Square, either. It's a good story, an entertaining read, but these details are jarring."
4,"Ok-""Highlighted"" Critical Reader - Chill, it's a romance novel.....","For the very reasons that the highlighted ""con"" reviewer writes ARE why you'll enjoy this novel....ah, it ain't James Joyce or Jane Austen....it's a romance novel. Lots of suspense, romance (that is ""Que caliente), and plot twists. But, really - isn't that why anyone reads romance novels? We can all read serious literature; enjoy & critique it - but, ah - sometimes you just want to have fun.....and this novel won't let you down. It's got witty dialogue, intrigue and romance. What more could one expect of a romance novel? Well, I'll answer that - a fantasy love story without ridiculous misunderstandings & stupid underdeveloped characters- yep, that's a good romance novel."
1,Very poor quality.,"Almost everything is wrong with this recording. The microphones seem to have been placed too close to the piper, the playing is rather stiff, and FOR GOD'S SAKE! IF YOU ARE MAKING A RECORDING OF A PIPE ORGAN, TUNE IT!!"
5,Bessey Sheet Metal Nibbler review,I ordered this product so that I could install a whole-house humidifier. I needed to cut two rectangular holes and one round hole in my ductwork in order to accomplish this. The Bessey Sheet Metal Nibbler worked perfectly! The product is reliable and very sturdy.
3,Its ok.,"It will cut through a certain guage of steel. Its hard to cut, but it should be expected when doing it manually. My only grevience with the product is that the handle starts to stick with only a limited amount of cuts. Also the design of the handle does not form to the hand well so its easy to get hand soars."
3,White Face - purchased to use for diversity training,Oh MY!! Beware buyer. Know your audience well or you will offend employees. This was an interesting film however it contained many swear words! Due to the language this film was deemed inappropriate to show our workforce.
2,A number of errors make this book frustrating,"Although I enjoy the overall format of this book and am learning alot, I found the errors VERY frustrating. There were several times when I had to abandon a tutorial because there were crucial steps missing or errors which were difficult to figure out so I lost out on what was being taught and was forced to move on to the next lesson.Later on, this was further frustrating as she refers to previous lessons. If you haven't been able to do them, it's hard to figure out what she's referring to.The tutorials really should have been tested much more thoroughly with beginner readers to ensure that they could be followed relatively easily and so that the errors and missed steps/information could be corrected. argghhhhhhh !!!! Not good !!"
1,Do not buy this book !,I wasted my money on this book. It was full of errors and missed instructions. Very frustrating for somebody just starting out in PS 7. Too bad the author couldn't be bothered to check out the tutorials before publishing the book !!
1,I've been ...,The pictures from the enclosed CD do not match the pictures in the book. Therefore I cannot do the lessons as directed ... What a waste.
3,Good Introduction,"Like the ""I am Hindu"" book, this book does not teach children much about Shinto itself, but it introduces them to the customs.The book is physically small. It contains colorful pictures with captions, simple large print text, and pronunciation guides for foreign words.I suggest checking to see if your library has the series."
2,German knives that are made in China,"Knives are dull straight out of box ,they look impressive but that""s where positives ends .Cheap Chinese not German knives ,impossible to stay sharp complete waste of money .I'm returning mine."
3,Dont feel a difference,Have not felt anything different. I just dont fell like it's done anything to chnage me or to help me
5,Great deal,You absolutely cannot beat this price. They work just as well as the more expensive vitamins and a fraction of the cost.
2,Waste of money,"I took the pills for almost 2 months with absolutely no noticeable results. Maybe it takes a year or so, I don't know. But I will not throw any more money at it to find out"
1,This is just 'Organic soybean oil!!!,This is just 'Organic soybean oil!!! If I'm reading right... the other companies are not selling you a few caplets of SOY...what a rip!
2,"After a month, nothing, nada","There does not seem to be any benefit to taking this supplement. I feel no different in any way. It may just be this brand. If you are insistant on CoQ10, try another brand or different strength. I would not buy this again, or recommend."
3,Ok pills I guess,"Do what they're supposed to do, I guess. Not sure if it's doing its job, but I guess they're doing what they're meant to do."
2,not effective for me,"I tried this because it's supposed to be effective in lowering blood pressure. I tried taking 1 a day after breakfast. Each day for about a week, I checked my blood pressure and it didn't seem to have any effect at all. I did notice a slight increase in energy but that's about it.After about 3-4 days I started to develop insomnia. I was taking longer to fall asleep and woke up at least twice during the night with difficulty falling back asleep. As a result I stopped using this and within a day my sleep returned to normal with no insomnia problem. I later learned that this is a side effect for some people. Also, after more research, I learned that 100 mg is way too much to start. Perhaps if the seller sold it in 30-50 mg capsules it would have been better. This may be useful for some people but definitely not for me. I'm writing this to warn everyone to be careful. So called natural supplements are sometimes not so natural after all."
4,Good as far as I know,I take this because I take red yeast rice for lowering cholesterol and because it is supposed to keep the heart muscle strong and pliable and prevent stiffness in veins. I have no idea if it is working or not but it had good reviews and is less expensive than other brands. I have not had any problems with it and just assume it is doing its job. I buy everything I can find on Amazon that is a better price than elsewhere. The free shipping over $25.00 wins me over every time.
5,Miracle,"Is it a miracle or what? I am aware that COQ10 is a good antioxidant, but to provide this type of anti aging properties is something new for me. I have been using it hardly 4-5 days and I have noticed that my expression lines are not so prominent now. My skin is smoother and overall I look younger. I am sure this product provides other benefits, but anti-aging one is the first thing I've noticed. Impressed."
5,CoQ 10 suppliment,"I have taken Co Q 10 for over 10 years after a heart attack. I found the product matches the over the counter brands at drug stores. Would buy this brand again, mainly because of price."
5,"truely the best, by a healthy 20 year old!","i love swanson products. i was just taking these for precaustions. i take one every 3days. when i eat junk food and get uncomfortable, i always drink one before sleeping."
4,Good Vitamins,"Among a large selection of vitamins, this was the most economical and was a true value based on other websites."
3,Shelf-life low on CoQ10?,"I guess it works and all, but I had to throw it away about half way along (I didn't take it everyday). It started smelling musty on me. I like to know is this common?"
1,Beyond a Reasonable Plot,"Sorry, but I must dissent with the majority of positive reviewers for this film. The ""surprise ending"" comes out of absolutely nowhere and fatally ruins this below-average effort. Dana Andrews doesn't have much of a canvas to display his talents here, and Joan Fontaine seemed a very unlikely and unsuitable romantic partner for him. The plot skips too quickly to the courtroom trial, and I wish the death of Sidney Blackmer's character had been less contrived. The film has an intriguing concept, but unfortunately things are rushed and nothing ends up being believable. Fortunately, I rented rather than bought this DVD. I suggest that only ""rabid"" Dana Andrews or Fritz Lang fans do the same and spend the remainder of your saved cash elsewhere. Frankly, it's just not worth your time."
3,unonteresting and dull,"did not find it very iinteresting...mainly boring and bad acting, plot also dull and predictable and uninspierd and wooden and unoriginal"
2,Clunky and preposterous,"A sloppy film that doesn't serve the best interests of anyone involved. Joan Fontaine is relegated to a supporting role that just about anybody could have played. Dana Andrews comes off as a mildy interested bystander, which is strange because he's the star. Most of the other performances are flat, but the real villain in this mess is the script, which is outrageously flawed. It begins with a crazy premise (frame a man for murder to prove the death penalty is flawed) and gets progressively loopier until it defies logic and credibility. To say more would be to give away too much, so I'll leave it at that. Save your money and skip it."
4,OK but not perfect.,"Gets a star knocked of because the 2 small shut-off valves are trash. They leak around the the handle. Threw them away. Other than that, the unit seems OK so far.I rearranged the output valve which made me have to replace the 160lb gauge since it's an upside down type. I didn't like the default arrangement because that left the gauge too low to read easily without stooping down to see it."
3,Sharpe Filter,"Just the name say's quality. I did not give it the best review because I was hoping for a large Desiccant type filter inside of the already large housing. But also when trying to open the unit to have a look at the filter, it was very difficult to take apart like I was told by a paint shop. The filter is small, just like your cheaper filter brands. I called a friend that owns a body shop that swears by the Sharpe name. He said no more than the amount of painting I do, not to worry. I never cared for those type answers. But I have chosen to keep the Sharpe since it has provision for two lines to run several tools at the same time."
5,"Wonderful, sensitive book","Knots On A Counting Rope is a wonderful sensitive book about the relationship between a blind Indian boy and his grandfather. The grandfather patiently tells the young boy about the boy's achievements despite the fact that the boy is blind. Each time he tells the story, he ties a knot in a rope. It is a story for all ages, but it is particularly good for those eight to nine years old and up. When I read it to a class, I usually tear up, but that is alright because, as I tell the students, it is okay to cry."
5,Knots on a Counting Rope,A wonderful story of a blind Indian boy who faces the challenges of life that apply to all of us.
1,Totally inaccurate book,"Sure it's a ""heart-warming"" tale. Many cultural inaccuracies are conveyed through heart-warming stories. For more detailed reference on the problems with this book, see:Slapin, Beverly, & Seale, Doris. (1998). Through Indian eyes: The Native experience in books for children. Berkeley: University of California American Indian Studies Center.[...]"
1,Waste of Money,"Although it looks sharp it has a very short life span. Mine lasted a year, and then it was KAPUT-- not functioning at all. Before it died, only the CD player worked adequately. The tape deck hungrily ate tapes, and the radio could pick up maybe five stations, AM and FM included. I treated it gently, but it was destined to die an early death. In my opinion, don't waste your money on it."
2,"No ""Boom"" in this Box","I purchased this alleged ""boombox"" to use in my woodworking shop, so I could listen to my large CD collection while I worked. For the relatively low price, I didn't expect much in the way of ""extras."" However, not only doesn't this box have ""extras,"" it doesn't even have a serious ""essential,"" as far as I'm concerned. The sound is just pathetic. The speakers are tiny, tinny and not very pleasing at all. The volume control barely raises the level to what could be called ""loud,"" and there is absolutely no tone control of any kind. No bass, no treble, not even a ""bass boost"" option. I listen to a lot of bagpipe band music, and the bass drums aren't even audible. My bluegrass is tinny, and my classic rock sounds like it's coming through a transistor radio. While the unit does *function,* calling it a ""boombox"" is being kind in the extreme. Do yourself a favor and check out the specials .... before you blow ... bucks on this squeaker-toy."
1,Not the Best,"It was a Xmas gift and it was not my choice. The CD player always had a hard time acquiring the CD tracks. It would sometimes say that the CD had ""0"" tracks to read/play. This was my major complaint about this item. I thought Aiwa made better quality stuff than this. Now, 2 years later, the CD player doesn't work at all. Bye, bye Aiwa."
5,wonderful wonderful wonderful,"The haunting, meloncholy, upbeat, smoothe, relaxing and obnoxious are what my friends have said. If you are a Velvet Underground fan, you'll love this album. Track 1 gets your attention before going into a queasy mood before Rushes of Pure Spring relaxes and gives you that warm fuzzy feeling. One of my favorite lyrics - ""I want to get stuck outside in the rain with you"""
5,Family Communication,This book was one of the required readings for my Human Communication class. It contained valuable information and was helpful in my practicum/placement(s).
5,very useful text for sociology student or casual reader,"From the jacket: "" The first text to examine the functional family from a communication perspective, Family Communication maintains its successful systems approach while incorporating new thinking in symbolic interaction and dialectical process. Updates in this edition include: increased emphasis on gender roles in the family; an even greater treatment of multicultural family issues; new stress models; and extensively updated research throughout each chapter. 480 pages, extensive bibliography, index.Sample hapters: Role of Children in Decision Making; Comunication as a Foundation of Intimacy; Family Stages; Decision Makin Model, Communication and Family Conflict; Development of Power in family Systems; etc."
1,Yuk,"Yuk, yuk, yuk, Parts of this book are insightful. However, there are many areas that are questionable. Not all families are alike but it leaves out major variations of family groups."
2,Load of nonsense,"Not a bad read, but it's all a bunch of unscientific, wishy-washy junk. Lots of the book seems redundant, and many times the author repeats the same unsupported, unresearched theories again and again. An interesting contemplation, maybe, but not a good university textbook."
1,Defective,"The book was missing a page, but I couldn't return it because I needed it for a class and I couldn't find it anywhere else. Disappointment. How do you sell a book missing a page?"
4,HIGHLY ENJOYABLE,"While visiting Sweden & Denmark, I bought a heap of Scandanavian movies, ""Shake it All About"" being one of them. I had no idea what this movie was about, (as it was titled ""En kort en lang"" on the cover)but from the moment I started watching I found it utterly charming and very funny, with some unexpected twists in the plot. I would categorize it as a gay comedy soap. The acting is great and the characters were all believable. My only gripe would be with a few bad make-up decisions, especially a less convincing moustache on a supporting character and an amateurishly assembled beard on another. But these are minor problems and did not spoil the movie for me. There are also some inside Danish showbiz jokes which ""outsiders"" would not understand. But a real fun movie with the kind of wonderful ending you'd expect from a romantic comedy! A movie you can watch more than once."
4,Just some info,"I am in the process of reading this book now, and it seems quite good, but I wanted to get this piece of info out there to others. Another review indicated the CME has expired. This person was referring to a prior edition. For the third edition (and I have confirmed this by email with the Foundation for Osteoporosis and Education in Oakland, CA)30 hrs. of CME is available until Sept. 1, 2012."
2,Shallow read,"This book tries to cover everything. Thus each topic is covered only breifly. The orginization and wording is passible at best. This book is not really for beginners but for the times when we forget the simple tasks.On the plus side, it is one of the few reference books with precompilers in it."
2,Soft core porn,"I love T and A as much as the next guy but this is just soft core porn. I'm an adult, if I want to watch porn then I will, I don't need it disguised as a vampire flick. The whole movie is just some loser going into a building and watching a couple vamps go at it gently, then he goes to the next the next building and does it again. The vamp girls are crazy hot and always ask him to join in which he declined, even though they show that they don't want to kill him, because he's searching for true love."
3,Potatoe sacks,"The potato sacks were miniture, causing the larger children to struggle to keep them up during the races."
4,great fun but not for adults,I got these for an adult group to use at a preakness party. really fun for single use. our feet came out the bottom. but I am sure for children the results would have been more uses with out problems. great time for the price.
3,Not what I expected,"Sacks were smaller than I expected. The quality is ok, I expected it to be more durable for the price"
5,sacks of fun!,This was a Christmas gift for my step-son a few years ago; they are durable. We have so much fun racing in our potato sacks. We use them at birthday parties & family gatherings. We even get asked to bring them to our friends' houses to share the fun. They are easy to use for children & adults; very entertaining!
2,odd,This book was purchased for a little girl who loves art. I did not give it to her after reading it.
2,Monoxide,"I just listened to this cd again for the first time since it came out. Still not very good at all. Beats are boring as can be. I like Monoxide and all but he is much better paired with someone with a spontaneous style, like Madrox."
3,alright.,I think monoxide could of did alot better on this CD. I deffinetly don't think he gave it his all. I think Madrox's phatso cd is a bit better but still not the best. The solo act it deffinetly not for them whether your listening to madrox or monoxide it isn't truely wickid unless it's madrox and monoxide... TWIZTID FOR LIFE!
3,OK But Not Free,"The CD is good for practicing fingerspelling and numbers, but the same practice (in one case even better) is available for free from various internet sites."
2,A big disappointment,"What a disappointment. I loved some of Anne Rice's earlier work, especially ""Interview With the Vampire"" but it's all been downhill since then. This book just goes to show that she's running out of ideas and is just cashing in on her reputation to make a few more bucks."
4,it's a great book,I read this book at leats five times and I thought it was a great book. I mean Lestat fighting with Memnoch that was a classic. The only thing about the book I didn't like was the way it ended with Armand running into the sun like that. But I have heard that Anne is about to write Armand so it isn't that bad.
4,An excellent representation of creativity,"This is the first book in the Vampire Chronicles that I've read (backwards, I know) but I was intrigued. I didn't find it hard to read at all. In fact, I've read harder in my 12th grade English class this year. Anyway, she has taken a very touchy subject and twisted it around and showed us a very different viewpoint. I loved this book, and if what I've seen by other comments is true, I will love her other books just as much."
2,WHY? WHY? WHY?,"My name is Bryan Jonathan Morris. I have just finished Memnock The Devil. Unlike the other four Vampire books I had to force myself to finish it. I love Anne Rice's books, but I hated this one. Why did Anne Rice even write it is what I want to know. I think that it hurt all of her Vampire book readers. It was a huge wast of time to read. It also went too far when it came to everythin the Devil was able to do and it went to far when it talked about why God made the earth. It also made God look bad....I love God and I hated reading those parts but forced myself to so I could findout what was to happen. If you want to ask me about the book e-mail me. And for those Vampire Chronicle readers that are just finishing The Body Thief, I think that you should stop there because reading this book will make you very unhappy"
2,Does Anne Rice get paid by the word?,Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets
1,The destruction of Vampirism,"**I request not reading on if you don't want me to ruin this or later books in the series** I am a fan of Anne Rice's earlier vampire novels. I thought that this novel and the ones that followed were plainly stipid due to the whole intertwining religion into vampirism. I think these books were just cheap shots in attempt for her to make some cash or an wasted attempt to satisfy fans. I'm a big fan of vampires and this ruined any enjoyment in reading any more of her novels. In my own opinnion she should not have made Lestat go all ""goody-goody"" and run to god."
1,Boring,"Lumbering, turgid, incredibly boring. If she sat down to write a suffocatingly dull book on purpose, she could not have done a better job. I am not a religious person, but I found the theology bizarre. And there is page, after page, after page of it. Pure torture."
1,Interview with Insomnia,"I loved the first four books. I am stuck halfway through this one because it is so turgid, and it is holding me up from enjoying the rest of the saga. The same debates are in the Bible, ""Paradise Lost"", and ""Dante's Inferno"", and the originals are a lot more interesting than the imitation. In fact, I'm just going to jump straight to ""The Vampire Armand"" - life is too short."
4,Interesting Philosophy,"The thinking behind this book has some interesting points to make and really does a wonderful job of creating the story. It's unfortunate that this book was (so obviously) written very quickly. Had Miss Rice taken the time to go back and edit and pull it more solidly together she could have constructed a true classic. As it stands, anyone who can look past the surface flaws and work with the core ideas will find material of interest. It should be noted that this is less a story of Lestat than the earlier Chronicles. It has the feel of an idea she wanted to explore which she chose to do by throwing Lestat into it, it doesn't seem that the story was really constructed for him."
1,"reading this book, I thought I'd gone to hell!","Sweet Jesus! This is Anne Rice's worst novel ever. It is a plotless rambling ego trip for one of my favorite authors. I've read most of her books (published under her own name) and the only other book that was this bad was tale of the body thief. I loved the first three vampire novels, The Mummy, and The Witching hour. If you are looking for a fascinating story read those. If you want to read an occasionally interesting, but basically plotless work of heretical judeo-christian theology, read this."
1,Thought that it would only get better,"Having originally read this book when it was first published, I thought that perhaps rereading the book would change my perspective some years later. Unfortunately, the book continues to fall flat. Whether it is simply poor writing or instead my annoyance with her interpretation of religion I leave to other readers to decide. Having thoroughly enjoyed the first three chronicles, Tale of A Body Thief left me numb and bored with the series. I had hoped that Memnoch would reignite my passion for her novels. I have decided now that I must be content with the first three books and pretend the last two were never written at all."
1,The WORST book I have ever read!,"After thoroughly enjoying Interview, Lestat, and Queen of the Damned, and tolerating The Body Thief, I was completely disappointed with #5 in The Vampire Chronicles. Memnoch was, BY FAR, the WORST book I have ever read - I finished it only because I was on a long bus journey in Japan and had nothing else to read, although I contemplated reading the backs of my credit cards and toilitries which, I assure you, would have been infinately more interesting. It was SO bad that it doesn't even deserve a critical analysis. A new reader of the Vampire Chronicles would be wise to stop after Queen of the Damned. After wasting time and money on Memnoch and Body Thief, Ms. Rice will have to publish a string of 5-star novels for me to even consider reading her again. (I would have given it ""no stars"" but Amazon doesn't permit me to do so.)"
1,"Love her, hate this...",I've read all the Mayfair stories and all the Vampire cronicles to date but could only make it throught the first 2 chapters of this one. Very self absorbed
1,Another Pulp Of Rice,"If you're an adult, this is a 1 star book; if you're a teenager, it's probably a 5 star book."
2,A frustrating simmer,"I really wanted to like this book. After reading The Vampire Lestat I immediately purchased as many of the vampire chronicle books as I could find at my local book stores, and sadly this was the first one I found.The pacing of the book is ruined by the character's unimportant rants. The entire adventure into this spiritual realm was unsavory, and leaves you wondering what happened to the brilliant writing style of the earlier books.On that note, read The Vampire Lestat. It's incredible."
4,gothic fun,"beautifully written,powerful.a must for any anne rice fan. reliogous people beware:it changes the christain reliogon."
1,Can I go lower than 1?,I never even finished it I was so disppointed. Lestat is once again cast into a cartoon light. No longer interesting.
5,A book I relate to,"Long have I asked the questions that this book asks about the true agenda of God & religion. I have always related to Lestat, but now I can relate well to Memnoch. His quarrel with God has driven him to a madness almost. He is so set in his mission to prove God wrong that he's become more like Him. Is the book long? Yes. Did I myself find it boring? No. There are 3 or 4 dry spots, and then Anne gets my interest right away. If you're looking for the meloncholy vampires from Anne's other books, than you probably won't enjoy this installment. If you're looking for a philosophical look at religion & the struggle of the human soul, than Please read this book. It may not answer my questions about religion & life, but at least I'm not the only one out there asking these questions."
2,Memnoch belongs in Hell!,"Ms. Rice, I love you...but...What was Memnoch about? I read it twice and couldn't figure it out. The Vampire Chronicles have been fabulous, up until now. Lestat, David, Armand. Absolutely! I don't understand the entire Christian mythology-esque undertones. The significance of Veronica's Veil and drinking the blood of Christ was totally beyond me. I could almost believe Lestat's otherworldly companion except for his tour of heaven. I just read THE VAMPIRE ARMAND, PANDORA, and VITTORIO, and I'm not worried. Just be careful what muse you listen to."
2,A vampire story that actually sucks,"Puh-lease, my first grade reader had better writing than this one. The plot was boring, the characters were out of whack, and everything was just really, really awful. The only redeeming quality was that it was a Rice book. Yes, I love Lestat and Louie. But not when Rice is trying to turn Lestat into a god. (Thank the good graces that her subconscious rectified the faux-pas.) Rice is suffering from a major case of ""Godism"". She's trying to turn her pet ""boy-toy"" into a god. That's just not right. Lestat is a vampire, as is Louie, Marius, Claudia, Count Dracula, Knick Knight, Lacroix, and every other vampire that I have forgotten to name. Okay, they don't need to be turned into something that they are not. In summary, Memnoch just sucks man."
3,It would have been her greatest novel ...,"... if she had abandoned the vampire connection. This could have been The Gospel of Memnoch, the Devil. It should have been. Here is a character to behold! To see the devil in a sympothetic light, hear in his own words, his view on us, the creation, and his beloved creator, was a spiritual feast. Imagine, if you will, that this Satan is a tragic hero of sorts. What rich ground to cultivate! One gets the feeling Anne Rice had been sitting on this Devil Interview for a few years, but didn't have the time to flesh out its own story. So, it appears that she bonded it, imperfectly, to her money-maker, Lestat. He is used as the vehicle for Memnoch to tell his tale. Now, I liked Lestat up till the Body Thief. Now he's been beaten like a dead horse. He was a distraction from the real meat of the story. Still, if you like to think about what could have been, read this book. It will let you see what could have been the most brilliant book of Anne's career."
1,Worst Ann Rice Novel I've Ever Read,"Normally I am an avid fan of Ann Rice novels. I've read Body Thief and Ramses and Interview so many times I know sections practically by heart. But this sorry excuse for a novel, especially a much awaited return to Lestat and his deeds, left me wanting. Rice's trip into the unknown realm was perhaps the worst side bar she has ever ventured down. Pandora was a nice return to her standard writing. That was fortunate because I feared her style had changed forever and that I would be left without a source for my vampiric novels."
1,Where did this come from?,"I love Anne Rice. I adore Lestat. Who was this character pretending to be Lestat in this book? The behavior patterns were to say the least uncharacteristic of Lestat. Although the text raised interesting philosophical questions, I think those questions could have been addressed in a short story. It went on endlessly. I had a real rough time even finishing it. Please Anne, bring back the old Lestat. Still love ya though."
2,"Not a Vampire Chronicle, but an excellent book.","Memnoch the Devil is not, I repeat NOT!!!, a Vampire Chronicle. At least not in my opinion. My question is why did Anne Rice, who is the master of weaving a character and breathing life into him, chose Lestat to be the protagonistof such a religiously baised novel? I loved every one of the Vampire Chronicles, couldn't wait to get my hands on the next one, but this one threw me for a really large loop. Earth circling you coulds say. I don't know waht I expected but it certainly wasn't what Memnoch gave. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the book and have read and reread it on numerous occasions, recommend it to friends---but not as a continuation of the storyline established for Lestat in Interview with a Vampire. It is a different genre of book from the vampire tales and I, personally, object to it being included in the Vampire Chronicle series."
1,Last Anne Rice book I read,"I've read about 7 or 8 Anne Rice books over the course of about 4 years. I read this one last year and decided to call it quits with Anne Rice novels. I really wanted to like this book. From what I remember, the first half was good and hinted at a potentially good story. The last half was horrible and I forced myself to finish the book!"
1,One of the books that made the burning bush turn to ash.,This was like some horrible alternate universe fanfiction. This is the point where Anne Rice has officialy lost it. The only books of her I hate as much or more than this is the second half of Armand (the first half was fabulous) & her ultimate betrayal to her characters & her fans in Merrick.
2,More like 2.5 stars,"_Memnoch_ is not a well-written book. I've never been a huge Rice fan, and _Memnoch_ does not change my opinion, but I do believe it is better than the average Rice novel simply because the idea is somewhat intriguing. Some of the theology is entertaining and having the Devil as a main character is always a good selling point. As usual, Rice is overlong and belabors the point ad naseum, but at least she is trying to accomplish something here. When Lestat is not talking to the Devil, he is constantly preoccupied with another character's menstration and there is plenty of needless and boring explication of exactly how many levels of angels there are and every step of the creation of the universe. I can't recommend the book. But it is better than the trash that the two previous books in the series have been. Disclaimer: avoid the book if you are offended by religious images or ideas that are unorthadox."
2,A disappointing effort,"I am an avid Anne Rice, and as much I love her Vampire Chronicle characters, I believe she should have ended this series with Queen of the Damned, rather than continue with TOTBT and this title. The stories seem anti-climatic and lack the magic and passion of the first three novels. It's as if Anne is writing only to please fans of the series, instead of pleasing her self as she did when writing IWTV. A big disappointment."
2,A concept in search of a plot,"At the beginning of the book Lestat says this book has nothing to do with Vampires. Well there you have it. The bulk of the book presents an interesting and sure to offend many - retelling of the Devil's fall and God's relation to his creation on earth. Lestat and crew are cardboard characters that nobody who had not read the other books would even notice. This should not have been a Vampire book. The main reason it was, no doubt, was to sell more books. The concept was fascinating and deserved to be part of a novel with a whole new set of fully flushed out characters and a plot for them. This book was a big waste. It wasted the Vampires on a plot that had nothing to do with them, wasted a novel concept on a rough draft, and wasted her reputation as a writer with high standards."
2,Disapointing,"I'll make this short and sweet, the novel was disapointing because; 1. She made Lestate in to some kind of Indestructable God? I mean how farther can she go with this character? 2. There were to many flaws in the story-line."
4,"Good, but not the best.","Memnoch is a fascinating character and he presents an all new view of life, and religion. I begin to wonder if Anne Rice could be onto something in her portrayal of Memnoch. I am saddened by the deaths of some of my favorite characters in this novel, but their deaths also serve to create an even more suspenseful reading. This book does not compare to The Vampire Lestat or Queen of the Damned but it greatly outshines it's immediate predecessor Tale of the Body Theif. THE END"
3,..couldn't sink my teeth in deep enough!,"It's the fifth book ..what do you expect? ""Lestat"" being every vampire lovers' hearthrob couldn't go wrong with this one. But the story leaves me a bit puzzled in the end..letting my imagination run a morale of it all myself. An excellent beginning, a tiresome narrative story telling and an exiting climax ""not to mention it's religious controversy"" for many. But I guess it lets us look at the ""the evil one"" in a different light! Well.. it still is an OK read."
1,This book sucked!,"I read this book about two years ago, and it completely killed my interest in anything else Anne Rice could write. The first four Vampire novels and the Mayfair Witches were excellent, but apparently writing those novels completely dried out her creativity. It seems Mrs. Rice can't think of anything original to write anymore, so she falls back on the old, ""Let's piss off the Christians"" tactic. This novel was disgusting and offensive to anyone with half a belief in God. It's a big, long sermon about how God is a big old meanie and the Devil is really a great guy. Maybe I could even overlook this if the sermon made any sense or was even halfway interesting. Anyway, this book was very disappointing. If you're gonna write about the Devil, at least make him scary or evil instead of trying to make us feel bad for him."
1,"""You serious?""","I'm setting this book down and don't plan to read another Anne Rice book.Dialogue between Lestat and David was terrible, it felt like I was reading a teenager's IM chat rather than an exchange between two adult men (let alone neither of them were under 70 years old). For the curious, yes, the title of this review is mocking a quote from Lestat.She has a lot of plugs into her previous stories, completely breaking from this story at some points. These plugs were far beyond what happened in Tale of the Body Thief; to me it seemed like shameless self promotion.Interview was a great story, unfortunately, everything I've read past that has been more disappointing than the last. I can no longer understand why people use the word ""talent"" to describe her writing, Tale of the Body Thief was painful to read, this is a book nobody should touch."
1,Ruins!,This is probably one of the worst novels I have ever read. It leaves a very bad stain on the first four wonderful novels in this series. Anne Rice's editors need to wake up and tell it like it is. I can't believe this was even published!
1,Hated It,"At first the book is interesting. It gives a different view on creation and the battle against good and evil. Yet when Lestat goes into hell Anne Rice gets too carried away with trying to describe people in it and what's going on. I started to think I was in hell just trying to finish the book or at least get to the point of his journey. I thought the best part of the book would be how it ends, yet I was wrong. Horrible ending (more like disapointing). The story should have finished half ways, the rest is just a waiste of time."
5,Excellent book!,"FIVE STARS PLUS 100!!!! This book was so amazing I finished it in a day! if you don't read any other books from this series, you HAVE to read this one. I couldn't put it down and found myself crying several times. This book is a true masterpiece! Go Anne!"
3,Going to far,Good book but I would stop at number 4 in the series after that it just gets out of hand.
5,one of the best from Ann Rice,I felt this book was amazing and it gave you a moment pause to think about the other side of the story of god and the devil.I know alot of people felt this book was not one of Ann's better books but let me tell you it beats that new book she wrote.
2,"OK for it's genre, not my style","It's ok for Anne Rice to delve into religious stuff, but please don't try to wrap your vampires in it, you just can't pull it off! Anne Rice's veiws on God and the Devil would be interesting at any other time, but not when we're expecting something to equal Queen of the Damned! I picked it up expecting vampires and got a lecture in theology. Write your religion literature, but don't package it as Vampire Chonicles."
4,well writen but not complete,"From reading all of the other anne rice books i thought this one would be even better, becaue the more I read the more I like each book. This book just becaue it was writin by anne rice was great. It was not as good as her other books, and at times it got a bit boring, and I did disagree with some of the religios things in the book . I thought the end was uncomplete and I guess I have to read the vampire armand to get what happends. next. I recommmend this book to anyone that is pacient and some one that wont get offended esaily. Memnoch the devil was a really well writen book altough some ideas werent that great. The beging was really good but towards the end it got boring, but I thought the ending was really interesting. It is not a bad book to read but the other books in the chronicles were much better."
4,pretty good...coulda been better,"This book, like the other Vampire Chronicles books, was pretty good. I liked this one more than the others because you really get into the plot, and as always miss Rice's detail is amazing. You actually feel like you're in heaven and hell. This book kind of challenges the way you think of God and the Devil, and it made me think about things like that in a light I've never seen them in before. If you liked the other vampire chronicles books, I would definitely suggest reading this one!"
2,longwinded,"This is the first Anne Rice book that I have read and I REGRETFULLY admit that I can't bring myself to shower it with excellent comments. Londwinded piece of crap if you ask for my opinion(save the fact that the plot was very interesting). Anne should have spent more time in thinking about HOW to present the plot well.Memnoch really has stamina in talking--PHEW, but i don't have the patience in listening to him."
2,Memnoch was rambling on and on and on....,"I loved the other Vampire Chronicles, Witching Hour and historical novels. But do I really want to read countless pages of Memnoch's biography? I found this book extremely hard to read, and I found myself bored, which is uncommon for a person that would read almost anything and everything I could get my hands on. The Vampire Chronicles is dirtied by this [insert word here] piece of writing. I read this book just because it is a sequel to one of my favorite books. I am sure many other people were taken advantage of this way..."
3,"If you're into philosophy & love Anne Rice, Memnch is for U","Basically Memnoch is extremely well written as all of Anne Rice's books are, however the story line is not that interesting if you are looking for a Lestat thriller. Overall I enjoyed the book because it dealt with God and the Devil and Rice's thoughts on their relationship.I would love to read a Vampire Chronicle starring Louis. Louis is a wonderful character. Although we all love Lestat, a change would be great."
2,What happened?,"What has happened to Anne Rice? Since Lasher her writing has decended faster than Memnochs fall from Heaven.I loved the Vampire Chronicles, I loved the Witching Hour and Lasher but I am losing faith rapidly.Memnoch is incredibly slow. I couldn't wait to put it down.Servant of the Bones doesn't look much better.Please, please Anne get it together.Very Disappointed"
5,"Very biblical, but with a sardonic twist....","This book takes me back to the beauty of Queen of the Damned where Anne Rice is able toweave a story by adding that special twist to common beliefs, such that the story isboth innovative, but still grounded in the familiar."
2,One very dissapointed fan!,"I was a huge fan of all the ""Vampire Chronicles,"" until I read this book! I had to force myself to finish it! It was way too lengthy and wordy! After eagerly awaiting the release of this book, I was very dissapointed"
1,Not worthy of the chronicles,"As a big fan of the first four Vampire Chronicles books I was extremely disappointed by this book. The author spent too much time preaching a rather unusual theological perspective and lost the main flow of the story. I found myself skipping huge sections of text without missing any of the plot. The Chronicles have always had a theological aspect to them, but it never consumed the story until this book. Your time would be better spent reading or re-reading the first four books in this series, particularly the second one."
2,Definately Not the Best In the Chronicles,"I am an extreme Anne Rice fan, But this book has to be the worst in the Vampire Chronicles. I found it very hard to read but forced myself to finish it after an attempt to skip the ending made it difficult to follow the later books in the series. I felt that it was extremely long winded and the point was often lost.Before this book the thought of over describing a situation had never crossed my mind, Rice definately managed to do so. Had it not been a necessary step in the evolution of the chronicles I would have never gotten past the first chapter."
3,More whining from vampires,"This one was disappointing to me. I thought it better than Tales of the Body Thief, but that is not saying a whole lot. I think a lot of the problem is that I am just getting tired of L'Estat's whining, and tortured, repentant vampires in general, even when they do meet god and the devil."
2,Interview with the Devil,"I heard alot of things about this novel before I read it for myself (most were warnings about how boring it was), and unfortunately what I had heard was true. I love all of Anne Rice's vampire novels, and I still say all, because this book is not one of them. Sure Lestat is in this one, even my beloved character Armand makes an appearance, but they seem to be there only as a vehicle for the real story this book is telling ""Tales of Heaven and Hell,"" or if you prefer ""Interview With the Devil."" My advice SKIP it! You don't need to read it to undrestand the sixth vampire chronicle, ""The Vampire Armand."""
1,It's all downhill from here.,"This book was dreadful, the intrusion of all the religious dogma Rice drowns us in her books from here on out is unwanted. This is the downhill slope where all of her characters personalities start changing until they're not their old selves anymore. I'm refurring to all of Anne Rice's books that came after this.I remember reading this in highschool as a Rice enthusiast with another like-friend. We both thought the book was awful. We really didn;t care about whatever ""point"" there was supposed to be to it. A few bbooks latter, my friend swore off Rive & switched to Poppy Z Brite & I switched to Christopher Pike & Lemony Snicket."
2,Ruined Lestats Image,I liked the book just fine but it ruined lestats whole image He's supposed to be a strong blood sucker that has very few feelings'but toward the end of the book he gets just as soft as louis. Anne Rice Really needs to write a book that reinstates his image.
2,"My God, Anne Rice's talent disappeared overnight!","Ok, where do I start. The Title: the original one was Of Heaven and Hell, which I like better. The Reviews: How can anyone praise a book that was so SLOW. Personally, this book is an enourmous offense to Lestat. The Plot: Lestat has turned into a whining, passive Louis; too much and too little character building into Dora and Roger; Memnoch never runs out of breath; Christ turns into a meal for a vampire; Armand DIES, why why WHY?!?; I for one did not want to know how Lestat drinks blood from Dora (18+). Alright, I've pretty much dissected the novel, which I did not read entirely because I found it so BORING and TEDIOUS and UNGRATIFYING. The only good part in the book that Lestat went insane, which I liked, no offense to Lestat, unlike this book. The Queen of the Damned was her best. Killing Armand was stupid."
5,One of my favourites!,I have had this book for more than 10 years and wore my paperback copy to tatters. This is easily one of my favourite stories of all time. When the pages started falling out I finally decided to purchase for kindle. Just to ensure I always have a copy if I want to read it again.
2,Anne Rice's MEMNOCH THE DEVIL.,"I began reading the book with an open mind - I'd read some bad reviews. In fact, the first - third? - of the book was very good. It seemed Rice had got her gay erotica under control, and the story was going great. I mean, Lestat meets someone claiming to be the Devil? Sounds like a great idea to me! But then, we reach the part when Lestat actually goes with Memnoch, and we find ourselves on completely different ground. Rice uses Memnoch as a way to re-write the Bible and create her own religion: Riceism. Arguments about God, what happened, how the earth was formed - basically, history and religion mashed together in one great big science class. Die-hard Anne Rice fans may be able to make it through the book, but I gave up about 2/3 of the way through, feeling very disappointed. Lestat and/or vampire fans beware; MEMNOCH THE DEVIL is nothing more than Anne Rice's version of the Bible. My verdict: you ain't gettin' no hallelujahs from me."
5,This is good stuff,I think that this was an amazing book i have read them all in the order they were ment to be read in and this one i just couldnt put the book down it tokk me 2days of reading inbetween work and family to get it done and i loved it.I thought that the view the devil is not evil was a great change to we must fight the devil he is all our problems it was refreshing.Thank you Form DJ
2,"Good, but by far not the best","Anne Rice captivated me with Interview With the Vampire, enthralled me in The Vampire Lestat, but from there her works have gone steadily downhill where The Vampire Chronicles are concerned. The Queen of the Damned led me up to the climax, but was worthless because this was not very exciting or thrilling. The Body Thief was slightly better, but again the climax was too brief and boring. Their plan succeeds without fail! Memnoch the Devil would be great if Rice wrote it without it being part of the series, but she wrote a Christian story among Gothic creatures of fantasy. . . and failed. If she succeeded in it, it may have been better, but it simply did not fit with the rest of the Chronicles. It had no real impact within the lives of the vampires."
2,"Poor, mediocre, moderate perhaps, but far from good.","A good enough novel from another author perhaps, but from Anne Rice? It feels as if she has straight jacketed herself in the mythic laws of both her own vampire history and those of the christian church.Too much retelling here and not enough new content.Lestat has descended into neurotic paranoia, as well he might being pursued by the devil, but who wants to read about a nervous wreck?Gone is the suave charm of the vampires as instead of being the hidden power amongst mortals they chitter and whine and are changed from being beguiling into wretched pathetic uninteresting characters.Does Lestat's final state indicate redemption? Is his wound at the hand of Memnoch and his understanding of the suffering in hell a way for he himself to be redeemed? Is he a more extreme form of Roger or even Uncle Mickey? I was left not caring, Lestat is transformed from a fiery star into a vapid lilting weasel spouting pastel philosophy."
2,"Not original, not well-executed, not worth reading","Anne Rice was clearly bursting with pride at her novel and radical novels set forth in ""Memnoch the Devil,"" so much so that she never really bothered to put much of a plot in. When you've got the devil as a nice guy telling the true story of the Fall and Lestat meeting Jesus, why would anyone need more?And, judging by the reviews here, I guess the Anne Rice True Believers don't. But for those of us who don't find the core concepts of ""Memnoch the Devil"" all that radical -- lord knows that they've shown up enough in genre fiction, television, movies and comics for the novelty to wear off -- tend to find ""Memnoch the Devil"" so thin, it's transparent.Even the gawd awful ""Taltos"" didn't wean me off Anne Rice, but ""Memnoch the Devil"" finally did. I winnowed down my collection of her books to the really good ones and ""Memnoch"" didn't merit a moment's thought.Borrow this from the library if you feel you absolutely must read it."
1,tedious and unenjoyable,"Being a fan of the other books in the Chronicles, this was especially disappointing. I found myself repeatedly glancing at pages ahead to see how long until the chapter ended so I could put the book down and take a break. As I read, I kept thinking to myself ""blah, blah, blah...."" You move from a gangster's ghost blathering on about his life, to Memnoch doing the same with his ""take"" on Creation and the Fall. Neither character made me feel sympathetic or that either made a convincing argument in their self-justification. I typically re-read books later on, but I'll be skipping this one when I re-visit the Vampire Chronicles."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Yep, this is bad. After Lestat kills a gangster, he ends up meeting a ghost.That is not all though, as he meets a Devil, and we get a long, tedious explanation and pontification on the whole relgion Heaven and Hell thing, and all may just be David Talbot had mentioned to Lestat before.Travelling to hell, Lestat gets hurt, and goes crazy, and Maharet has to help him.If you are a fan of the first three books, and that is the sort of thing you want, and don't want to read religious discussion through the mouthpiece of vampire characters, please avoid this book."
5,This book should be mandatory reading,"I wholeheartedly think that this book should be required reading in every religious education class. It is a wonderful story that will shock all but the most stubborn of people. If you like to have your faith put in the spotlight and new ideas put in your head and heart, then read this book. If you would rather be another dull and uninspired person then I would suggest you stay right where you are. This book in my opinion only is not designed to place ideas in your head. It is simply designed to make you think."
3,Not the best,"I have read the other 4 vampire books (as well as Pandora) and this was not her best...in fact it could be pretty slow going at times (although not as excrutiating as ""Violin""). If you want a good one, read ""The Witching Hour"" or ""The Vampire Lestat."" And what is the deal with killing Armand (so stupidly)? Her new book is an Armand chronicle. Does that make sense?"
3,"Thrilling at times, overall very slow.","I'm a huge Anne Rice fan, but Memnoch disappointed me. It was too slow and too detailed at times. It ended well, but overall, Memnoch did not live up to the other previous books in the series which I adored."
2,Vampire Fans Should Stick with the other Installments,"This is a disappointing novel. After having enjoyed the first 4 volumes of the Vampire Chronicles, I had trouble getting interested in what was mostly a long dissertation narrated by the devil. Vampire fans are better off skipping this one, and moving right along to the Vampire Armand."
2,what does vampirism got to do with all that ?,"I have always been a great fan of Anne Rice and I loved all her books, The Vampire Chronicles, the Mayfair witches, until Memnoch. I think the idea of creation and all that heavenly stuff being connected somehow with hell is just too confusing and boring. A sad follow-up to the great Tale of the Body Thief...I still love Anne Rice ..."
2,Anne lost me,"I was disappointed with this book, if only because the other Vampire Chronicles have such great storylines. Although I did enjoy reading Anne's interpretation of God and the Devil, I think both Lestat and the reader suffer. The story of Creation and such drag on and on while the ending of the book is too short and too weak. I'm left wondering what the next Chronicle has in store for Lestat...hopefully it's much more than this."
1,Ahem... how disappointing.,"I purchased this book in its hardcover form as soon as it hit my local bookseller's shelf. The more I read, the more disappointed I became, until I finally just had to put the book down and walk away. Not one to leave a book unfinished, I managed to push myself thru to the very bitter end, which left me exhausted. I'm not an overly religious person, and I know that every one has their rights and opinions, but this went a little too far... even for me. Heavy sigh..."
4,My somewhat review.,"I dont really have a lot to say. Most of what I have to say has already been said. I see that there's a review from Anne Rice here, although it could be bogus, I'm incined to believe it because I have no reason to not believe it. I too find it odd that people can think the Lestat giving Dora oral (God forbid my mom finds this review) is completely disconnected from the plot. And even if it was completely disconnected from the plot, I cant see how it can offend people so much. I certainly wasn't offended by it.I think Anne Rice has some origional views on religion, and I found it all very interesting. The way she portrays the angels is incredible. I was actualy feeling guilty because I liked her portrayal of Memnoch more than God."
2,Not Anne Rice's best work,"I have to start by stating that I am a huge Anne Rice fan. I read the first four books of this series and thought them to be incredible moving, insightful, and a pleasure to read.Memnoch, the Devil was a true disappointment. Perhaps it was my high expectations, given the previous four books. What appealed to be about Anne Rice was her incredible insight into the human psyche and her ability to capture the depths of human emotions. In Memnoch, Rice goes off on a very strange tangent by focusing on religious issues of God and the devil. Although her ideas of good and evil [and heaven and hell] were mildly interesting, this novel had very little to do with the human experience. I found myself painstaking having to ""finish"" the book [I always have to finish a book, no matter how bad it is]. I still haven't given up on Anne Rice and hope Vampire Armand will redeem her."
2,Is this really a Vampire chronicle?,"I was left wondering why Lestat was even in this tale. The story seemed more about the Devil whining that God was an insensitive so & so than a tale of the vampires I have grown to love. Throughout my reading I was either bored, or (more often) offended. I am not prudish, but I did not like the way the God I and many others believe in was reduced to an indifferent, bumbling fool. I grew tired of Memnoch's retelling of the Biblical creation. I kept wishing Lestat would do something other than go on and on about how beautiful the Devil looked. Personally I think Anne Rice set Lestat up against God and the Devil because he had no other antagonists left. What next, Lestat in space?"
1,Egos don't come any bigger than this.,"The Vampire Lestat. No more dark mystery. No more dark profound immortal gift. Lestat is now just some git with ""long nasty, pointy teeth"", as the Monty Python boys would say. Memnoch belongs in Southern California at a victim counselling group, talking about how, you know, like totally misunderstood he is, kay? God is a bad tempered hippy with a beard. Anne tells us all we need to know about evolution and creation, coz she knows, you know. She was there, honest.Anne is bored and has loadsa money, so its time to muck about with her readers for a good chuckle. If I had as much cash as her, I suppose I might feel like being as mischevious and see if I couldn't get away with writing a bit of old dross like Memnoch the Devil."
1,One of the worst books that I have ever read...,"I am about a hundred pages from finishing this book and the only reason I am still reading it is because I keep thinking that it will only get better. I am not a huge Anne Rice fan. I read Interview with the Vampire over a decade ago at the behest of a friend and was not impressed. When I heard it was going to be made into a movie, I read it again and was still not impressed. The movie was better. Anne Rice has a huge fan base so I thought I must be missing something and attempted to read Ramses the Damned. Not impressed. After one hundrd pages into the Witching Hour, I gave up. No more. Recently, a friend of mine at work told me about the story of Memnoch the Devil and I decided to give it a shot because it sounded so interesting. This book sucks. Interesting concept but very badly executed. Boring. Why does this writer have so many devout fans? This will be the last Anne Rice book I ever read."
2,"Memnoch the Devil, a Vampire Chronicle?? HELL NO!!!!","Anne, you have proved to me that if you wait long enought, your heros will fail you. This bookhas nothing to do with the Vampire Chronicles.Who is Lestat and Armand in this book, certainly not the characters I know from the past books.And also what do I care about the charater Roger. He has nothing to do with the story?! The good part of this book is Memnoch's story about God and Heaven and Hell but if I would really tell you the truth, it was trite and boring and non-developed. Anne take more time on writing books PLEASE???!!!!!. And also the endng was just pain stupid. Armand doing that. Anne dont you read your old books to keep consistenscy????? PleasePeople ignore this book, move on!!!!!!!"
2,Just shoot me!!!,"Spare me the ""belief-challenging"" bullshit. Anne Rice's last two books have been pure crap(MTD & SOTB). I fell like asking for my money back.On one side, you get to hear all about Anne's belief, and I mean everything.If you must buy it, wait for the paperback.(I recommend saving your money"
2,Who stole the vampire Lestat!,"I cannot give this book a lesser rating, because it was not a complete disaster. It was definately very thought compelling, but it lacked the heart and soul of the previous Vampire books. I read it straight through like the others, more out of loyalty and hope that it would get better. I did enjoy the story, don't mistake me. However, the characters were not as alive as in the previous books and the plot was all over the place. The wordiness reminded me of the Mayfair Chronicles; I was enthralled with the possibilties of the story, but at times did not think I could read another word. In conclusion, this was not what I had anticipated it to be, and so am still feeling unfulfilled about the destinies of my vampire LeStat and my Louis, as well as the others. For Vampire fans, you will be compelled to read this, but maybe you will enjoy it more if you lower your expectations"
2,Rice went to the well too many times,"This boring installment is a notch worse than ""Body Thief."" The series is masterful as a trilogy. Don't ruin a good thing. Read only the first three: ""Interview"", ""Lestat"" and ""Queen."""
4,Memnoch the Devil,"I've read all of Anne Rice's Novels, excludiing Blood and Gold because it is not yet in paperback or in my local library. Reading a few of the reviews I decided to give my perspective.Interview and all the books after Memnoch are almost from a different series, barring Merrick which I find a little difficult to place in the scheme of things. The Vampire Lestat through Memnoch are stories about Lestat. They are not really about the other characters. They are telling his story/stories. Memnoch, I think, is a look inside Lestat's soul or lack there of. Lestat's whole purpose has been to find truth, and draw attention to himself from everything and everyone. All his previous adventures challenged God and the Devil to see him, to watch him. In this novel he may have found the greatest of all truths or may not have. This is not a religious treatsie and I feel it stays very true to the character of Lestat and her other novels."
5,Excellent Book,"I think this was a great book and my favorite by far from Anne Rice. I feel sorry for the people who gave this book a bad review because they felt it's purpose was to ""bash Christians"", obviously they are not very well educated. If nothing else, this book makes you think about God, the devil, heaven, hell and the theory of creation in very philosophical terms. It's purpose was probably to make everyone think a little differently, not to make them reject any religious or personal beliefs in God. So if you want to sit down with a good book that gives you a very thought provoking take on creation, read this one, it's worth it."
5,Challenge the establishment,"I am not a fan of Anne Rice, I never followed the vampire stories or whatever, but somehow I got my hands on this book and I was completely blown away. This book is basically the authors' interpretation of Western religion. If you are looking for some kind of vampire story then you will be dissapointed. But if you are looking for a unique view of God and the Devil - then read this book today! The book is FICTION people and no one is claiming anything to the contrary. Enjoy the book to that end."
2,Depends on what you're looking for...,"I am not one who searches for the meaning of life, or makes theories about ""how it all started"", so for me this book was a disappointment. What some might find intriguing, I found tedious. This book was not an important addition to the Vampire Chronicles, like Lestat admits in the introduction, it's not important in this story that he is a vampire. Anne Rice is a great author, a fact that doesn't change in this book, but for someone expecting another action-packed continuation of the glamorous lives of the vampire, this book is not fulfilling. For those who are interested in fantastic theological theories, this book will prove enjoyable to you at least."
1,Left me empty,"I'm seeing a severe decline in the quality of Rice's novels. In the past, I would jump at one of her books on the bookstore shelf, now, I wait for it at the library and skim through it before I borrow! If you thought ""Cry to Heaven"" was bad, read this one"
4,"Very, very interesting . . .","This book took me by surprise. I expected a continuation of the Vampire Chronicles; instead, I got a fascinating alternative viewpoint on Biblical theology. Being well versed in these matters, the book was especially interesting for me because Anne has clearly done her homework down to the last detail. But if you are not a Bible buff, do not despair: the book is as riveting and as gutsy as its predecessors. If you're in the mood to bite off a bit more than you can chew, this is the book for you."
5,A gripping tale. A fine work by an accomplished author.,"I loved this novel. I read it while on a cruise in the Carribean. I could not put it down. I was drawn in by Rice's grand colorful storytelling; our Lestat, the mysterious dark angel, God in his heaven with a twist. Mrs. Rice has the testosterone to take her readers where most authors would never dare. I must say that I read fiction because I want to be entertained. I enjoy mystery and supernatural subjects. I know it is fiction therefore I have no problems with its content. If this appeals to you, by all means don't let this one go unread. You will not be disappointed."
5,WOW!,This is a book that will make you reassess your perception of God & Satan and Heaven & Hell. I feel Lestat was made for this journey into the mystery of God's plan. This book was so compelling that I read it straight through from beginning to end in one very long sitting. I like to think that Anne Rice has defined Heaven as it should be and offered a plausible reason for Hell. She has a way of drawing you into impossible situations and making them seem possible & real. The only part of this book that I didn't like is when she claims that Lestat has left her. However; what adventure could possibly top his one?
2,Disappointing,"It took me over a month to finish this book. If I like a book, it usually takes me less than a week. I kept putting it down for almost any reason... Even for (Ugh!) television. I read Servant of the Bones and couldn't put it down. The same with the other Lestat books. What happened to this one"
1,Dreadful,"This book is absolutey dreadful. I'm working my way through The Vampire Chronicles and had enjoyed all the books up until this one. I now have reservations about reading any of the others considering how bad this one is. The book started out fairly well with the mixture of Lestat's pursuit of Roger and the mysterious being that is stalking Lestat. Unfortunately, the book quickly becomes a ridiculous history of religion as seen through Rice's eyes. A pity. The beginning of the book could have led to so many interesting plots. Why Rice chose the ""plot"" she did is beyond me. This is a book to avoid. The books leading up to this one are all worth checking out (even the somewhat less successful The Body Thief is pretty good)."
4,Not the best Anne Rice book,"This is not a bad book, but it isn't a good one either. At times it becomes boring, but the path of logic that Anne carries out is very scary and that's what kept me reading the book. It's not as easy to read as other of the her books and there are better books by Anne Rice."
3,Not the Best in the Series,"While Memnoch is good if you want to spark a theological debate in your monthly book club, it is not the best of the Vampire Chronicles. Here prior works far outshine this novel. So much detail is given to the descriptions of LeStat's conversation with Memnoch that it detracts from the real storyline of the book. I was also surprised by the obvious Judeo-Christain bias that appears throughout the novel. Instead of questioning that belief system, as LeStat often does, Anne Rice attempts to persuade readers of the validity of those concepts. I found that to be somewhat disturbing."
5,an entertaining throw on religion,"i have always loved books that played around and twisted religion to create or just make obvious different, often unlooked at facets of them. this book was no dissapointment. it took the often controversial, questionable, and sometimes laughable religion of christianity and put an astounding twist on it, sometimes making it appear that the moral roles of god and satan are reversed. a definite must read."
2,Hardly A Worthy Exit For Lestat,"Let me first say that I love Anne Rice's novels. But that is not blind love. I hated this book. First, it is badly paced. The whole story was too lose. Second, I didn't recognize Lestat at all. This is not the Lestat I have come to know. Thirdly, I had to hack through the pretentions in this book with a machete. I know that Mrs. Rice has a flourish style to her prose, but it makes me wonder whether if she is getting her money's worth out of her editor. It also makes me wonder if all that overly elborate prose was used to cover up the fact that there was no true story here. Finally, (and most importantly) this book was flat and boring. If any of you want to read Anne Rice at her best, go back to the first two books of the Vampire Chronicles. Stay away from this one."
2,Reading with Tequila,"Memnoch the Devil was nothing like what I was expecting as the next installment of The Vampire Chronicles. Absolutely drenched in theological argument, Memonch the Devil is not for anyone who dislikes religion in their fiction.Only two things happened in this entire book. Lestat stalked a victim for the first third of the book. He then spent the last two thirds of the book talking to the devil (and occasionally God). It was written as what appeared to be an extremely long-winded interview (think Interview with the Vampire with Lestat as the interviewer).The basic premise of the novel and especially the detail with which Memnoch described the creation of Earth could have been enjoyable if Lestat didn't interrupt constantly with annoying and mostly pointless questions, as though reminding readers he was still there. Memnoch the Devil was dry reading and dragged along slowly. It was imaginative, but the way the story was told was extremely dull."
2,Difficult to follow and a bad ending,"This is a bad follow up to the previous novel 'The of the Body Thief.' 'Devil' has Lestat basically seeing ghosts and follows the Devil through Heaven and Hell in order to decide if he's going to be the right hand of the Devil in Hell. This book is incredibly slow and deals way too much with religion and things that don't really pertain to anything. The cutaway chapters with David Talbot and Armand are actually the best parts of the book. If you liked the other Vampire books, then I recommend skipping this one, though stuff does happen that will affect the next book, so you may want to mutter through it anyway."
3,Why did the Devil chose Lestat?,"Anne Rice provides a new angle on the God vs Devil discussion. It was very clever of her to use Lestat as a vehicle to explore this angle. But I was let down towards the end of the book because I wasn't able to follow the reasoning why Memnoch decided to be King of Hell and why Hell was described as a school for the souls. Too much happened in the final 5 pages with Lestat returning from Hell. The veil as a miracle, Lestat finally sucking Dora's menses while Armand and David looked on, Maharet returning Lestat's lost eye, Armand's suicide, Mael thinking of suicide - why spend so much effort in building up the climax, only to end with a whimper?And why did the Devil chose Lestat as his assistant?Lestat ranted at the end that both God and Memnoch were mad. I think Anne was mad too."
3,Memnoch the Paper Weight,"The Fifth book in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, Memnoch the Devil gives an interesting view of christianity and of God and the Devil. This book, in my opinion, is my least favorite of all the Vampire Chronicles. Memnoch didn't have the action-packed, page turning, fast paced plot that I have come to know and love in Anne Rice's novels. This story tells of The Vampire Lestat's decent through heaven and hell guided by Memnoch the Devil. I thought that this book involved to many theories and spent too much time on thought and flashbacks to the beginnings of time. Most of the characters from the previous novels were not even in it, and it was long and hard to follow."
2,Very Disappointing,"I was very disappointed reading this book. In my opinion, the plot was a veiled attempt to hide the true nature of the book, a place for Anne Rice to put forth her own theological views. I dont read the Vampire Chronicles for that reason. I read them to see what trouble Lestat is in this time. Though the storyline to this book was good, it would have taken away half the pages of the book if she had not put the theological theories. in"
4,Awesome read for the faithful and anti-christ alike!,"This book was a blast to read. It's a masterpiece. Rice beautifully describes every detail, and the Vampire Lestat is one of literaure's most memorable characters. I was sad to see these chronicles end, but what an ending it was. If only this wasn't fiction, then all of our questions about Heaven and Hell would have an answer in this novel. Don't pass it up, even if it's your first time reading the Vampire Chronicles. Actually, Memnoch was my very first one, and I'm not starting read the others!"
3,Good but could have been better,"I am probably one of Anne Rice's biggest fans, having read all of her work. Memnoch was good, but had too many flaws. 1.It was way too slow. 2.It didn't have a lot to do with the vampire's we have come to know and love. 3.It was too wordy. She could have said most of that crap in two chapters. Other than that it was a good storyline and a good description of good and evil. It gives you a whole new way of looking at God and th Devil."
3,What Happened to The End?,"After reading Servant of the Bones, which I was disgusted by, I decided to give Rice one more try considering Memnoch was part of the vampire chronicles. The theme and plot were very interesting, and Rice's descriptive power shone through. Yet, when I got to the end I felt cheated. I was left feeling like someone had just stolen the last 100 pages of my copy. The book itself was very well written, but there was no real ending, and with this I was very dissapointed."
1,False Premises,"It's so easy to wrap Lincoln in the dogma of a Liberator. But, was he a liberator and a freedom fighter and a defender of the Constitution when he arrested the entire Maryland Legislature? The mayor and police chief of Baltimore? When he sent Fed troops into states that had not secceeded?Like a true politician, Lincoln said all the right things, while doing all the wrong things"
2,butterglory?,"I bought this album by mistake when it was in the lambchop section(recommended!). I made myself listen to it two or three times and it started to grow on me. The drone of vocals is not the most appealing aspect of this album, the music though is very emotional, in an out of tune way.I cant comment on anything specific as the album was stolen some time ago, however track 3 has a strangely dark and attractive sound. the last track ""the lion weeps tonight"", builds up slowly and quietly and climaxes quite beautifully."
5,Fantastic German pop,"This male-female duo from Germany has made a fantastic record that combines opera and classical influences with German electro and industrial. ""Omnis Mundi Creatura"" combines a gorgeous orchestration and powerful vocal arrangement with a marching drum machine that propels the song at a nice pace. ""Selig"" sounds like a demented Christmas song. My personal favorite is ""Sancte Stor,"" which sounds like nothing I've ever heard before; clashing vocal pitches ride alongside a panic-inducing industrial rhythm, and the results are phenomenal. If you like stuff like Front 242, Haujobb and Deine Lakaien, GET THIS NOW!"
5,The Scottish Golf Book,"(After reading 50+ books on Scotland courses and related topics, I have edited my review here.)THis is the best book to buy on the topic. Abuntantly readable.When researching golf courses in Scotland, as well as some of the history of the game, this book helps put a photo and visual description with the courses. This book covers not just the big courses on the Open Rota, but digs down to the historical courses (and ""Hidden Gems"") not often known by people outside of the UK...Also, great photography and layout including some nice information on the History of the British Open."
2,repetition is good ... sometimes,"I think the repetition used for these tapes is a good thing. It helps us learn the words and phrases better. The thing I don't like, from a teacher's point of view, is that there are only two drinks used in the examples...up to lesson 8 so far, anyway, ... and they could have chosen different drinks for each tape, helping us learn more words. It's not that hard to learn the two they used being they are almost the same as in English."
2,Sweet but dated...,In 2006 this book looks quite dated. The photos don't seem quite... modern. I can tell that this was published more than a decade ago just by looking at the super-annuated home fashions. Pretty but not of today!!!!!
2,<kinda sad that he didn't like what he did,"A good book overall. Good description of the work and the dangers etc. I have 30 years underground and think that his description is pretty reasonable. My only complaint is that he simply did not like the work and it simply was a money maker out of desperation. This is true for many people, but, believe it or not, a whole lot of us like it.I found his descriptions of the equipment and the processes as that described by someone that really doesn't like it but has to take it. A bit like a root canal. Well, since we are pricing ourselves out of the world market, the desperate , doomed men will no longer roam the depths."
1,A complete work of fiction,"When the movie says ""Based on actual events"" it means that loosely. BTK killed his first victim in 1974, not the sixties. He didn't have two sons but a son and a daughter. He never had a ponytail. He didn't kill his victims in the way the movie would have you believe. The actual events were dramatic enough without some screenwriters turning history into a cheap B-movie. If you are buying this movie expecting to see a documentary forget it, it's about as historical as a Troma movie."
1,BTK,"First of all, I live in Kansas where this all actually happened. I wasn't even born when the BTK killer was on his spree. Infact, I didn't know anything about him until he resurfaced in 2005 and was all over the news. My whole problem with this movie (besides it sucking), is that it wasn't factual. They didn't have time and dates right or even how many people he had killed. He started killing in 74' and his last was in 77' or 78' and he killed 2 men and 8 women. It was just lame overall and not accurate. I would give no stars but you can't do that so I gave it one."
1,Boring!!!,I wish I had seen some of these reviews before purchasing this DVD I could have saved myself some time and money. This has got to be without a doubt the biggest load of rubbish I have ever had the displeasure of watching.The acting was amateurish the storyline was uninspiring all in all this rates as one of the worst movies ever. I wish I could give this film zero stars but unfortunately this is not an option so I am stuck giving it 1 star which is way too generous.There is not much else to say except don't bother with this film it's not worth the effort.
1,This was RIDICULOUS,"Someone please slap me because I BOUGHT this movie at my local grocery store thinking that it was going to be a documentary or something. In reality, this was not even a B movie... is there such thing as an ""F"" movie.I do not think real film was used to for this movie... just cheap Beta tapes and a video camera 1981. Furthermore, the only accurate ""fact"" in this movie was the name of the killer. Dear Ulli, BTK did NOT carry around a picnic basket full of scorpions, tarantulas and rats to the crime scenes. And when the ""Nancy"" character said ""I know you... You're the dog catcher"" I thought I was about to fall off my seat. Dear lord in heaven, please do not rent, buy, borrow or steal this pathetic movie. The fact that it was completely inaccurate, looked like it had been filmed by a 12-year old and contained non-sensical, gratuitous violence should be reason enough to stay far, far, far away from this piece of crap."
1,VERY CHEAP MADE!!!!!,"I rented this from the video store, the cover looked very interesting,when i got home to watch it,the film looks like it was made with a 1985 home video camera its was not shot with movie film,I took it back to the video store and demanded a trade in.warning!!!! I would avoid this stinker."
1,One star is being too nice.,"I cannot review it because I never even finished it! I hear Ulli Lommel use to make pretty good films. What happened? They replaced his brain with cocaine, heroin, crack, crystal meth and Everclear? This wasn't the first UL film I have laid my eye balls on. After watching at least 2 mins of the other ones, I went to get baptized by Jesus himself."
3,"""NOT"" Complete Fiction","The ""young"" Dennis Rader character was developed with research from Robert Beattie's book. The words from his letters to news & police stations were accurate. The budget was below ""ultra low"" so it made it difficult to respect the history of this terrible crime spree. Production did their best to respect what happened. The film is just a film that tries to show how putrid this man was. Take the info with a grain."
1,IF YOU BOUGHT THIS MOVIE DON'T OPEN IT JUST RETURN IS QUICKLY!,"The only reason I don't rate this as a no star or even 1/2 star movie is because it isn't an option on Amazon. I bought this film while serving in Iraq, where the only thing we had to do much of the time was watch DVDs, and still didn't even finish the thing. Troops in combat zones will watch almost anything, no matter how B-level or low budget as long as there is a coherent plotline but this looks like someone spent about $500 bucks on everything including crappy camera equipment and actors and edited the movie (and I use that term loosely) on their pc before releasing it. My title stands, if you're thinking of buying this movie don't and if you bought it don't open it so that when you return it you can get your money back with no hassle."
1,is this a joke?,"i almost broke up with my girlfriend for picking out this movie at blockbuster. i cant even put into words how bad this movie was, i really wonder what the people who made this were thinking."
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!!!!!,"I actually bought this movie b/c the package looked pretty good. It looks like it was edited with two VCR's. The movie did not make sense and the actors and actresses were horrible too. I do not usually write reviews but this was the biggest waste of money. So bad I did not even finish the movie. Shame of it is I think the story should be told, but next time they make this movie I hope they have more than a $1,000 budget to spend. Don't buy this!"
1,WORST MOVIE EVER,"It should have negative five stars. Terrible script, terrible directing, terrible acting. It does look like amateur video, as another reviewer said. Absolutely not worth your time as all it does is recreate the killer's crimes on videotape, complete with lame dialogue. No police investigation, no analysis, just voyeurism -- like a 70's porn flick only with violence -- and the cherry on top is that footage of the crimes is interspersed with footage of animals being slaughtered.Stay away. Stay far away."
2,Sorry,"I want to like it, but my dogs simply will not touch it (Pom and terrier / poodle). Maybe others will have better luck."
3,naturvet arthrisoothe,"once again, the package too large but I kept it. Mix with my chihuahuas food every night and he likes it... too early to tell if it's making a difference"
3,Go with Power of Now audio book instead,"Alas, I can't recommend this collection.There is nothing in this Audio Collection that isn't available more succinctly in the original Power of Now, a book that I consider a true, elegant masterpiece.I've given my original copy away and listen to the audio version when I drive, which has become a very rich part of my day."
1,Unclear Audio,"Unfortunatly, I had to return the collection due to the quality of the product. While the information is life transforming, the sound is very unclear. During Tolle's talks and meditations you hear coughing and even a wierd laugh from someone attending, every so often. I would highly recommend the CD of his book, The Power of Now. That is done professionally and worth every penny. The Audio Collection is the opposite. It's just thrown together and should be taken off the market and recorded again."
3,Eckhart Tolle Audio collection,"It is OK., but kind of boring. I expected it to be as exciting as the classes he and Oprah taught on line but it is not. This set of CDs is so monotone that it puts me to sleep every time I listen to it, so I have yet to hear the complete set."
1,Is this it?,"I thought the Power of Now would say something about it being The Power of Now series. I got a Trilogy. It's OK. He sounds like he has had some elightenment experiences, but he seems to make fun of people and he has made up an image The Pain Body as a teaching tool, which he has begun to treat as fact. I know what he is talking about (I'm a bodyworker psychotherapist who works in trauma), and his map is not exactly accurate. He says that the pain body wants to fight. I don't think that is true. We imprint the way we are treated, and when we can't give it back to our offender, we are prone to scapegoat. So, he's a little off in my opinion for someone so highly regarded."
1,it lost my interest,I honestly listened to the first CD for only 5 minutes before I gave up on it. I bought the CDs to listen to in my car because I am a very busy person. After a couple minutes of trying to understand what he was saying and listening to someone coughing in the background I was extremely frustrated. His voice is very quite and hard to understand. I have listened to plenty of books on CD and this was definitely the worst. I might listen to it again when I'm having trouble sleeping.
5,I have read the book and bought this as a gift,"The person I bought this for was delighted to be given this useful guide to a happier way of being. Having read the book previously, she told me that this audio collection helped her through a difficult time in her life, and it was easy to access the wisdom therein during her commute to work and back. I thoroughly benefitted from reading the book myself and would read it or listen to it again. I found it life expanding, thought provoking and comforting."
2,Disappointing,It was very difficult to lists to him speak since it was so slow. If don't like to listen to peoplewho talk really fast but this is boringly slow. Got nothing out of ti
3,b o r i n g ...,I like the subject and the content but this audio book is a not so great recording of the author speaking. The author speaks really slow and has long pauses where I am guessing if the cd ended or is it pausing and then after 5 seconds he continues speaking...??? then you can also hear a phone ringing in the back ground a few times during the play....all of that seemed very distracting and if I was to choose again I would rather go for the printed version.
2,THERE IS NO SHORT CUT!Be careful.MOST .MAX FILES NOT SUPPORT,"If you ever bought any Max book, I recommend buy two more books instead buying this CD. Few actual files are supported and most techniques are easily found on any other Max books. Check out Max user groups or just follow Tutorials from Max help. Models used in this CD no more impress today's 3D artist. If you are a beginner or self-learner to look for a short cut, I have no objection to get this CD."
5,The Best time IS Now!,"What a wonderful series and for sure the last episode, titled ""the Best time is now"". Though we may all want to return to the nostaglic days of James Herriot, we are reminded in the last episode to seize the day ...Carpe Diem!Fabulous from start to finish, wholesome and inspiring."
4,All Creatures Season 6,"This is one of the most entertaining seasons on DVD of ""All Creatures."" Callum and Dierdre finally tie the knot; we see Tristan for a while, after being absent from the series for a number of episodes. The quality of the photography is better than in previous years; no more of the video in interior shots and disjointed film for outdoor shots. Now, it's all on video. A must for your ""All Creatures"" collection."
1,"Hate to be a spoiler, but...","I like TNH and I believe in supporting the Buddhist press. That said, this is a poorly written, repetitive, rip-off of a book. Its scant 54 pages contain the poem/teaching noted in another's review 3 times. The premise of the book can be stated in a simple paragraph.Simplicity is a hallmark of TNH's style. And there are other texts written by him which are clear, gorgeously-written and inspiring. I highly recommend ""The Path of Emancipation."" Read slowly, it is bound to put you in a meditative state.""Our Appointment with Life"" is not a bad book. It is just very thin and more of a disappointment than an appointment for it's $9.95 cost."
5,Our Appointment with Life:,"Anything this author writes is worth reading and holding on to for insight and inspiration. I pick it up when I need a teacher in my life and then I, as a student, am ready to recieve the lesson."
5,happy to read,"This is a good book, some parts are a bit repetitious of other Thich Nhat Hanh books. This is a short read."
1,Not what was expected,The songs that had vocals were sung by children. I didn't buy this to hear kids sing songs....I was disappointed with this and do not recommend it. The marches section was ok.
4,Great for school and patriotic themes.,Used this CD in the classroom. It was wonderful to have the children tie the songs to the theme of American Independence as we investigated the new nation. We plan to use the marches on the CD when we cover great composers.
4,Hilarious!!,"I love the East Side Kids because it captures the spirit of the people of that time period, not to mention that it is hillarious!! Good quality filming, a little fuzzy but very wachtable"
3,Starbuck's Long Lost Father,"It's nice to see Fred Astaire make a guest-appearance. This episode helps reveal some of Starbuck's background and begins to flesh out the character somewhat (Unfortunately, this never happened with most of the characters during the series' limited run).The story of discovering Starbuck's father is a good one, and it's actually better than a number of other episodes, yet it still ranks as another episode that didn't measure up to the series' full potential.Still, it's entertaining and watchable for any fan of sci-fi cult classics."
4,Good review,The book was received in good condition and in a timely manor. Thank you so much for your honesty and promptness.
5,Bring It On,They sure did. It was nice to have all four of the movies together. Able to start with the first and enjoyed all of them thru the fourth. I would recommend to anybody. 5-star rating*****Can't wait till the next one.
2,Could not play with it,"I bought this for my family to play with, but when we opened it we noticed one tile was a different color. This dominoes was supposed to be ivory color but it is white and only one tile was ivory/beige color, so we could not use it."
3,Late 1 Nite,This movie was not as good as I expected. It shows a good example of turning the other cheek and the harrassment many Christians go through at work and in general. It is much too short.
1,There was no real plot,This was just a short encounter in a cafe. There was not point except a little (very little) witnessing. It just ended and there was no conclusion. I had to make sure it was really over.
1,"Good Story Line, Bad Story","This makes Christians look like fools, Let people abuse you, and just keep your mouth shut.... That's not in My Bible..."
4,They took drum and bass to another level,"True, this genre pretty much came and went long ago, but I think Third Eye Foundation still holds up. ""What to Do But Cry"" has one of the most startling openings of any song, ever. Theirs was not a dance music aesthetic, really. It had an emotionality and eeriness that kept me riveted."
2,Least favorite TEF,This is easily my least favorite TEF... after the mesmerizing distortion of Semtex I was expecting something similar... instead I found something that actually annoyed me at times. There are several over-repeat tracks here... personally I'd recommend skipping this and going to the surprisingly good You Guys Kill Me. If you can find Semtex I'd recommend that as well.
2,nice try,"come on now. Whoever thought that looping an annoying sound can make a 7 minute song is seriously messed up. If this guy had better equipment, like the stuff used on ""you guys kill me"" this would be worth getting. 4 tracks and drum and bass don't mix."
1,Horrible,"There is nothing useful in this book at all, the sample size is just too small. The only bet I would make is that the author rigged the results. STAY AWAY!"
3,Baccarat - Carefully,"I wouldn't buy this book if you are just starting in the game. This book can help you through bad shoes, but you must be able to recognize what a bad shoe is, and then apply a combination of basic strategy and advanced strategy #3 (Run Vs Singleton).However in good shoes. 7 or more ties per shoe(Because I play ties) I have found that if you use the methods in this book. It costs you money on good shoes in mini-baccarat. Now if you have good money management skills. (aka. quit while ahead.) And know what you are doing, but would like some help getting through bad shoes, purchase this book. If you are looking for a book to start learning the game. Look elsewhere."
4,no computing of house edge,"the author presents the game as if there were no house edge and all of his strategies and calculations conveniently leave out the effect and drain of the 5% commission paid on winning banker bets. otherwise it is a well-written book with some theoretically useful strategies, but no holy grail here."
1,WORST.BOOK.EVER!!,"This tome, which is unfortunately required by most states as the core text for AIT programs, is a big stinking pile of horse manure. Information imparted here is horribly outdated and doesn't appear to have revised since at least the early 80s. It bothers me that Allen pretends to be either a nurse or a doctor in the section on resident health issues when he is in fact neither. I am also confused as to why so much of the chapters on government regulation focus on ADA while there is virtually nothing on the CMS survey process. This book teaches you nothing needed to actually practice as an administrator. The only foreseeable reason I can think of to get this book is to prepare for the NAB test, which is also horribly outdated and seems to be based on this book. The best way to change the culture of a nursing home is to burn this book and scatter the ashes, then never look back."
2,DONT BOTHER,"As stated in the other reviews, I found this book totaly out dated. Numerous typos, organization in some areas > what a mess. If Allen had spent 1/2 the time on the prefixes, suffixes, and abreviations > (which some I as a nurse of 25 yrs have never seen nor heard)and worked more on Life Saftey Code and Administrative Duties - we would all be happier."
3,"""LUCKY LADYBUG"" IS THE GREAT SINGLE","I downloaded Guv'ner's ""Lucky Ladybug"" off this three song CD single, (we need new terminology for the music of the new millennium), and was awakened to what sounded like a warped indie version of an old Perry Como/Doris Day record with alternative music non-sensibilites. The kind of song Doctor Demento of radio show fame would have held dearly. After the song tipped my brain to permanent imbalance mode, I ordered a copy in the hope the other tunes, including the titled ""Break a Promise"" would return me to equillibrium. Unfortunately the other two songs aren't nearly as demented and now I'm stuck here like a juke box that forever skips."
1,Rip off,"I bought ""Mexico City: An Ancient Mystery of Passion"", another travel guide DVD by Acacian Tales. If you want to watch a slideshow of fuzzy pictures with crummy music playing (nothing is ever said), this is your DVD. If you don't want to be ripped off, stay away."
5,Best WWII u-boat game ever seen,"I bought this game five years ago, and I still keep playing to it ! If you like u-boat, you'll love this game. Yes, it is now a little old but its realistic navigation model and easy-to-use interface should be an example to follow for the more recent game. By now, game developpers tend to abuse of 3d-video and neglect what really make a game playable and exciting.I have still to look at Silent Hunter II. I hope this sequel will prove as good as its predecessor."
1,Rehashed Slop!,"We've seen it all before. After the success of Saturday Night Fever, a small-time label named Pickwick released three albums of old Australian Bee Gees songs. Weren't quite a few people surprised!Don't be fooled. Buy ""Birth of Brilliance"" or ""Brilliant From Birth"" for more songs of that period with superior quality. I mean, really, the nerve!"
4,To Be or Not to Be,"These are songs from the beginning if their career, and you can clearly hear what great talents they are. They where very young when they recorded this material(14-18 yrs??), and the songs has a freshness that I sometimes miss in their newer and more sophisticated recordings. I never get tired of listenings to these early songs. Most of them are just amazingly beautyful songs!!"
5,Read this book!,"Spencer the Adventurer is a fabulous book. Kenney combines entertaining adventure with vivid characters and place descriptions. In addition, he weaves themes of diversity, culture and travel into the action-packed plot. This book is excellent for elementary school classrooms and summer reading. Adults will enjoy it as well."
5,Fascinating story,"This novel was a complete surprise. The characters and the evolution of the story are amazing. There is no sugar coating the life in Australia during the gold rush nor the lines drawn between poor and rich, natives, chinese and whites. The characters are all interesting and the stars are Diamond and Perfection. Around these two women are many years of suffering and their quest to find love and happiness. The twists, turns and adventure are all captivating covering beautiful and harsh land as well as adventure by sea. I recommend this book to anyone who loves history and a true picture of what it took to live during 1860's."
3,River Of The Sun,"This book was very interesting and made you want to carry on reading, and the characters where good,but a few issues in the book I felt were unresolved and the ending seemed to suddenly hit you. All in all it was very readable."
4,Good Journey,"A smart, snappy plot and a noticeable lack of Native American stereotypes give this film extra added pizazz.Well worth a look at."
5,A Closer Walk With God.,"To understand yourself and God and the relationship between you and God is a question everybody is seeking to answer. This is one of the best books I have read that uses reason and blunt honesty to bring you to a deeper understanding of the question and the answer.If you are seeking to better understand the why, the what, the how of salvation this is a must read,it can only enhance your knowledge and understanding of the spiritual life."
2,Horrible Trance Anthem Albums Are a Dime a Dozen,"If you think we have plenty of electronica compilations here in the US, you should see what they have in the UK. Music store giant, HMV, is loaded with electronica. It can be daunting to know what to buy when you have no clue. This is one of those albums for me, and the last random trance album purchase I made.Both discs have the uncanny effect of causing me to grit my teeth with an overwhelming urge to pull my hair out. One good thing though. It did help to clarify what not to buy when it comes to electronica. Firstly, if an album cover says ""Trance Anthems"" on the front, and Secondly, if there are 20 tracks on each disc...chances are the compilation is going to be pretty dire.Disc 1 gets 2/5 stars, and Disc 2, 1.5/5 stars."
5,JEN & JOE PERFECT PAIR IN QUIET MASTERPIECE,"With apologies to Mr. Maltin, who apparently hasn't a clue about what's going on here-- LOVE LETTERS is a poignant exploration of the nature of time, memory, pain & regret, & the healing power of non-judgmental love freely given. I am moved again each time I see it-- Jennifer Jones is at her most radiantly beautiful as Singleton-- a girl I would marry in an instant-- but of course delightfully dry Joe Cotten is on hand to claim his ""pinup girl of the spirit"". This is one of those ""ensemble"" movies where every part is played to perfection, but Cecil Kellaway is a stand-out as Joe Cotten's resident ""gargoyle"". LOVE LETTERS is highly recommended if you feel like being misty-eyed & uplifted at the same time!"
5,this is the s***.,"from the blissful beginnings of ""teeth"" onwards, this album will drown you in sonic heaven. just listen. long live neil h & co."
4,Good Stuff,Cats & Dogs is a kick ass record by Royal Trux. Most of the songs have got a killer groove. You'll like it. Trust me.
1,Expired product,I love this product. Ordered here and received an expired in 2008 perfume in Aug. 2011. I noticed the expiry date only today (11/4/2011). Product is very good but don't buy here.
4,JETHRO TULL LIVE at AVO SESSION BASEL,Jethro Tull is my FAVORITE band of anybody......this concert is LOUD considering....sometimes the shrillness of the flute really comes through.....I'd still like to see some older stuff come out on DVD that I don't already have on VHS.......the older line up of members also!!! over all this concert is still good....and I have TICKETS already for this years tour AND WILL see TULL again as I have EVERY TOUR (even Ians' solo tours) since 1976!!!
4,classic corelle,Purchased these to add on the sets I already had. Needed extra dinner plates but did not want to buy another whole set of dinnerware. Shipped fast and was packaged well. Nothing broken in shipment. A bit pricey to buy individual pieces but didnt have the room or any use for all the extra stuff in another complete set.
2,"Updated book, still has serious flaws!!! :(","Getting to the point, pages 180 & 181 are incomplete!!! the formula is given for the ""area"" of a circle BUT the examples and answers are NOT complete!!! The area of a circle with radius 3 = PI times 3 squared = 28.26 NOT 9Pi square units!!! This is a very bad example of teaching young students!!! Page 108 ""The Pythagorean Theorem"" A square + B square = C square!!! Where is the formula shown???? This is the BONE basics of the Pythagorean property and its NOT mentioned.... This is the updated 2010 edition and someone STILL forgot to ""proof read"" this book... The book is OK but you need the COMPUTER to cross reference and find ALL the mistakes & correct them..."
2,Not Very Good,"On page 16, it is stated that the area of a circle is pi times the diameter. Is there anybody out there who DOESN'T know that the area of a circle is pi times the square of the radius? That error wouldn't such a big deal, except that there are plenty more to come. I don't recommend this book to anyone."
3,Not So Painless,"This book targets those in middle and high school having trouble getting Algebra. I am a teacher and hoped it would be a resource easier to understand than our Algebra textbooks. This was not the case. Aklthough the book works well in the early part of the book, it quickly grounds to a halt. The author tries to condense too much and she leaves out explaining some steps in the process. Those ommissions turn out to be crucial. You have to already know a lot about the skill she is talking about to have any hope of understaning or following her. The book quickly became very painful. I tried it with students and it is worse than standard textbooks. The students could not follow her at all after the first one sixth or so of the book. I would not recommend this as your primary teaching source for geometry. Ouch!"
4,has most of what I need,"needs to be more complete. I think it was triangles I needed more information on. did figure it out on my own, but it was tough. I had to look in my trig textbook to see the definitions of tan,sin,cos atan, and I made use of a calculator function called atan2. so that, given angle and one side, could find another side."
4,"Good Live Album, Featuring Some Great Songs","What can i say about the levellers..... They rule... Nuff said.This CD comes with a booklet on the uk & europe zeitgeist tour 95-96. And a craaazy hologram-type-cover-effort that makes it like you are actually at the gig if u wiggle it about in time to the music, its quite battered.14 Sweet tracks, nice version of the boatman/3friends, dijeridoo sounds xtra xcitin"
1,More garbage,"User beware: DO not buy any software with the Iolo brand name on it. It is only malware. System Mechaniac is garbage, crashes your computer and doesen't pick up viruses. Drive Scrubber does nothing, and this Security does absolutly nothing only take up hard drive space. Get Windows Live One care, it's solid in all aspects. Plus One Care found system mechaniac and this crap as threats on my computer which they were."
4,the six stages of parenthood,I use this as a reference resource for our child care parents i.e. in conversation and lending library.
2,Disappointed.....,"I've been a Keith Sweat fan for awhile now, but this albumn....how should I put this.....was a disappointment! He tried to make almost every song sound the same and he's lost his touch. Keith, stop trying to be like everyone else and start using your own creative juices."
2,been here many a time,I give Keith Sweat Props for hanging around as a New Jack Swing Artist strange as it sounds New Jack Swing Artists have had a Harder time getting respect than Disco Artists? anyway this Set follows the same Formula that Keith has been doing since the 90's.a Couple of Aight songs&a bunch of Begging&Pleading Material that is a Serious Johnny One Note.He finds a way to hang in there so for that alone I'll give Him Credit but Musically He is just going through the motions waiting for the towel to come into the Ring.
3,Everyone is right - Keith stick to Ballards,"Although I like fast tracks such as ""ladies night"" and ""gots ta have it"" these tracks do not bring out the best of Keith. The rebirth in my opinion, starts at no.7.""one on one"", ""show me"" (the best on the album), ""in and out"", ""can it be"" are all Hot ballards.(Ain't got a clue why some people don't like ""can it be"". One of my favourite tracks on the album.)Anyway, the album is worth the purchase, but only for the ballards ."
4,Making it last forever,"What a great `comeback' CD for Keith! With Lavert, Luther and many of the other old school balladeers still making CD's, this proves to be literally a `Rebirth' of a new career for Keith Sweat. For those who loved him in the past with such hits as ""Make it last forever"" this CD still offers some of his old style of music; PLUS many new tracks that will give artist's like Usher and Brian Mcknight some competition in this genre.This CD shows great promise for Keith with a CD that has excellent songs and great production. There is not a track on here worth skipping over. Let's hope the radio stations will honor some much-deserved airplay."
2,So Sad,"I am or should I say was a Keith fanatic but plain and simple, Keith makes the mistakes as many artist do; he forgets about the audience that he came in with. Obviously he is focusing on the younger listeners with his latest three albums. I was very disappointed with this entire CD. The songs were not well thought out and the writting for these songs suck. Keith, two words, Come Back."
3,Keith Left Us Hanging AGAIN!,"On Keith Sweat's ninth album, ""Rebirth"", Keith Sweat once again finds himself not up to par with his first five albums. He leaves his fans hanging with too many poorly produced fast songs and not enough of his slow songs. Tracks 7 and 12, ""One on One"" and ""Can It Be?"" are good slow songs. The song ""The Right Stuff"" sounds like something that Timbaland would produce. (And don't get me wrong, I like Timbaland!) And the two bonus tracks (tracks 14 and 15) weren't even necessary!I gave this album a three for effort, but for Keith's 10th album, he would need a devestating recovery after not one, not two, not even three, but FOUR albums that flopped! And he should be getting ready for a greatest hits album."
4,consistent,"as usual Keith sweat never disapoints. Other reviews are a bit unfair regarding the uptempo tracks as the first two ones are excellent, the slow jams are slightly below his usual productionsoverral its a fair year for this Keith sweat album!"
2,Standard Keith Sweat,"On his Rebirth CD released in 2002 Keith Sweat was a comeback, however because he's been putting out records consistently since the late '80s, and it's not really a creative reawakening since he hasn't changed anything about his game. In the end, Rebirth is really just another Keith Sweat album with promisng ballads. One would have thought that Mr. Sweat would linked up with some new young talent at the time to give him a fresh sound, espically on the up-tempo but the ballads are really the only thing that save this CD. The first single One on One is very good as is Wonderful Thang, but everything is kind of by the numbers."
3,Beautiful and simple music,"This CD is so beautiful because it's simplicity: in these times of extra long CDs, a lot of them just filled up to the top of nonsense demos and all kind of stuff that does not worth a buck, it is a real joy to get a CD that you can listen in almost half and hour (because sometimes less is more, you know the motto). The songs are fantastic, and without overdubs and without arrangements: simple guitar playing and her voice almost nude. I ove specially the cover on ""Femme fatale""."
2,SI belt accessory provides minimal added benefit,"I am both a physical therapist and an SI joint pain sufferor. I own this pad with its accompanying belt and a competitors belt that does not use a pad. I found the pad to provide only very minimal improvement over the belt alone. The pad adds enough bulk to the belt that it is visible under clothes and affects how clothes fit, making the clothes themselves uncomfortably tight. The pad also leaves a permanent crease in the non-skid under surface of the belt. It will probably cause damage if used for very long. I only wear my pad on days when my pain is so horrid that I will try anything for relief."
5,recommended by teachers,I teach elementary school and have used wiggle seats with various students. They are wonderful!! I have found it to be particularly useful with students who are diagnosed with ADD/ADHD. It allows them to move while staying in their seat and completing their work. I definitely recommend this product!!
5,I couldn't put this book down!!!!!!!!!!!!,This Is an awesome book that will make childrens imagination's run wild Soulai is a dynamic character that shows a lot of growth! This book definitely deserves 5 stars! I hope that all young readers read and cherish this timeless novel!
1,Elvis Forever,"As always Love anything on Elvis, always something found that is new and interesting. Would recommend this DVD to any Elvis fan."
5,Pavement at their rawest,"'Westing' is a collection of all of Pavement's low-fidelity early singles and EP's, which are all a lot more dirtier and less melodic than the bands later material. Infact, this album is so dirty, I really can't imagine anything else that has been recorded so ... badly. Pavement walks the fine tightrope between barely audible and musical genius like never before.Underneath the dirt and grime lie some of Pavement's best songs, however if you're a stickler for hi-fi quality, you're not going to find anything to like. Myself, while I do like the cleaner sounding stuff, I had no problem with 'Westing' and loved every grit-filled minute of it.If you jumped on the Pavement train with 'Slanted & Enchanted' or anything after that, you <i>need</i> to buy a return ticket and pick up 'Westing' to see what you have been missing all this time."
2,for obsessive Pavement fans only,"Unfortunately I fall into this group.This cd sounds to me like a band had to put something out in order to fulfill a record contract, I'm not suggesting anything like that, just sounds like that. Pavement just happens to be such an incredible band it is better than a lot of bands albums period.Being a home recording enthusiast, I found it pretty interesting, but for the average music fan, I don't know if it will be liked."
2,"You really don't need this, casual buyer","...but if you are a big enough fan to be a completist, why the heck not, if you want to hear your fave band's demos and snippets of practice sessions, go 'head. Out of the thirty or so songs on this album, only maybe five are fully fleshed out, the rest is just Pavement f'ing around.Let me be clear-Pavement was a really cool and fun band, but this is not meant to be casually enjoyed. I mean, if you think this music speaks to you or describes anything around you, you are likely in need of shock therapy. Or you're 19 and don't know any better yet. This is coming from someone who thinks ""Sister Ray"" is one of the greatest songs ever made. Some noise is brilliant. Some noise is just noise."
3,Julliard who?,"The reason I've given this set only 3 stars is that it is impossible to tell without opening the actual cd cases when it was recorded and who plays on it. For future reference, it was recorded mostly in 1977 by Mann and Carlyss (violins), Rhodes (viola) and Krosnick (cello.)If you want a large chunk of Mozart quartets, this is probably your best choice, but if you are looking for the legendary performance, this ain't it."
4,"MY MOTHER SHOOTS BETTER THAN THAT, GRINGO","The film opens with some beautiful scenery and music. It lulls you into believing this is going to be a classic western.A British woman (Inge Rademeyer) travels out west to live with her uncle. In route she is kidnapped by a quiet gun slinging murdering cowboy (Cohen Holloway) who attempts to rape her, but realizes he is not functional. The cowboy drags her around the countryside seeking a cure for his ""broken"" manhood.Our woman who is refined and educated provides a stark contrast to the overly stereotyped slow talking dim witted cowboys. As the two characters get to know each other we expect the predictable Stockholm Syndrome to set in when things take a slight twist. It is an interesting and unconventional western. It has action, drama, and humor. Clever, but not spectacular.PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs, no sex, rape-like scenes, male rear nudity (Cohen Holloway)"
4,Good for Nothing DVD,This movie is well made with good actors. The locations & scenery are interesting. I will recommend this video to others.
5,great film,It was a low budget film done in New Zeland (i think) With the low budget there were some things that did not measure up to hollywood mega films but. It was extremely well done and not overly verbose. The humor was subtle. I loved it.
3,What happened?,"I must first say that the author is truly gifted and has a flair for characters and story telling. I enjoyed the book and found it to be an easy read..... HOWEVER I kept asking myself WHAT HAPPENED. It was a great build up between Corey and Kenshasa, but the abrupt ending left too many questions to feel completely satisfied. What about Michael, Jennifer, and I know Pat's gone but???? Maybe this was the set up for a sequel, but the ending kept this from being an EXCELLENT must have book. I look forward to Ms. Bess' next efforts"
3,"Definitely different, but not hott in all areas.","I can pretty much consider myself a fan of Timbaland because, musically, his style is much different than a lot of the hip-hop producers in the game right now. The 'Indecent Proposal' album is listenable, but not spectacular. Even though I've never really cared for Magoo's lyricism, I thought he fit in the album pretty nicely, as he shared some mic time with the likes of Jay-Z and Petey Pablo. As I tried to explain before, this record is mostly FILLER and not KILLER, as most of the tracks on the album were very average. The only joints I was feeling off the album were ""Drop,"" ""All Ya'll,"" ""Baby Bubba,"" and ""I Am Music."" Other than that, most of the album was not all there. I guess I can say I recommend this album if you're a fan of Timbaland and Magoo, but if unorthodox beats and lagging lyrics are not what you're into, then 'Indecent Proposal' is nothing more than just that...an ""indecent proposal"" for an album."
2,No longer Fresh,"I think this suffers from the fact that when Missy Elliot and Timbaland first appeared, this sound was new and fresh. Now if you switch on the TV, 50% of tracks are inspired by them so this doesn't stand out as much at the 1st 6 or 7 tracks from the 1st Timbaland LP or the first time you heard and saw 'The Rain' video. Missy Elliots new LP is the best she's done I think yet this is clearly Timbalands worst...he's been giving his best work over to others. Of course, most of the lyrics are banal and hopeless but thats not why you listen to this stuff. Jay-Z stands out amongst a bunch of banal and uninspiring performances. Truly mediocre. I'm not losing complete faith in his work, but he's right to make this his last release as clearly his best work he does with other artists.I like the track 'Serious' and 1 or 2 others...if they were out 3 years ago I'd have been even more excited."
2,ITs a little on the weak side 4 real,I too am a huge timbaland fan but his ryhmes are weak on this joint and so are magoos...andwhy is petey pablo on almost every track.. its weak... get timbo's first album and him and magoos first one... those are tight!
5,Strictly 4 #1 Timbaland Music Fans,This album is off the chain. I been down w/ Timbaland since his 1st record and this album proves why Im stickin w/ him. Im a music producer n this record aint nothin but ear candy both instrumental and lyrical wise. Nowadayz its hard 2 find legit producers who keep me either bouncin or bobbin my head constantly. Timbo does his job 100% bringin out full potential on every track. U should def. cop this record if u in2 pushin the lines of hip hop music 2day n lookin 4 a new sound.
5,the indecent proposal was too nice,when timberland went to the studio to put these beats together he had a evil genius thing goin on.cuz each song has an unbelievable beat. just straight fire
2,Dissappointing,"I tried to listen to this album without being dissapointed but I just can't help it. His last album with Magoo was a classic in by book. But now it's just sad. From this it is safe to say that Timbaland has gotten rusty over the years. You would think he would put more effort into his own album but that's not the case here. I love the beats he makes for Missy Elliot's new album but I wonder why he didn't use the same influence on his own music. Because of this, Timbaland has lost a major fan."
5,THUNDER - Buy it!,"Wonderful CD. THUNDER is a great rock band that should have made it big, but didn't due to timing. If you like hard rock, you'll LOVE THUNDER!"
1,How to Lose Your Chess Rating in Ten Days,"Sorry for the brevity of this review, but I have no better way to sum up this book. As with most of Eric Schiller's work, this book makes your chess worse. It is loaded with filler ""wisdom,"" such as how to win in 4 or less moves in six different ways, two of them involving the losing side's king marching to e2(e7) unprovoked. This completely useless material is a good example of what a waste of trees this book is."
3,Decent.,"This book can be useful in 2 ways. First, it can expose beginners to a whole host of topics that they will eventually have to delve into in order to be decent at chess. These beginners can learn most of the broad rules of thumb that decent players take for granted. Second, once you become a weak intermediate - intermediate player, it might be useful to review the concepts once in a while, just to keep them fresh in your mind. It's funny how after studying a particular opening for a long period of time, you often forget one or two basic broad opening principles...This book is the epitome of a three star book. It's decent, simple (necessary for its target audience) and does what it sets out to do with no frills or great ""bonuses"". In other words, it's fine. Unlike the atrocity that Schiller's ""Standard Chess Openings"" is, but that's another story..."
1,Eric Schiller produces another terrible book,"This book atracted me at first, since it looked good, and seemed to convey the essential knowledge any player who wants to improve his game needs. It dosent. after buying this books, i realise it was made for complete beginers, and was filled with extremly useless knowledge. The best example was a section about ""mates in the opening"", where Schiller presented how to mate in the scandinavian: 1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 and if Ke2 then Qe4 mate. what does this useless examples, which will never occeur in a game (who plays 2.Ke2?) help me?Schiller is a 2200 player, who has published over 80 books, some of which he writes in days, and ive seen many of his books, all of low quality. I urge you not to buy this or any other Schiller book. No matter what your level is, this book just will not help you."
1,Just a horrible book,This book could only help a beginner. It is like everyone mentions sloppy and poorly edited. There is a bit of everything in here but not much of actual value that you can't find anywhere else.Don't buy this book...you can have mine ; )
3,One Error I Think I Found in Audacious Book,"Twice Eric lists six criteria that can be used to describe any move. However, they do not appear to include a description of the different types of promotion material (queen, rook, bishop, or knight)."
4,DVD COMEDY,Very funny dvd comedy by an unbelievably talented actor/comedian. His routine and impersinations are incredible. Kevin Pollak will leave you laughing hesterically.
1,BE WARNED -- SAME OLD JOKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you've purchased any prior Kevin Pollack material, be warned -- this is just a new package of the IDENTICAL jokes contained on ""A Little Off the Top"" and his first self-titled album. He just cleverly changed the titles of the tracks to sell even more CDs with no new material. I love this comic, his impressions are dead-on, his material is funny -- but don't keep selling me the same tired jokes. I'm not buying them anymore."
2,Not so good,The color of cover is weird and it looks like the book is fake! the body and the cover are kind of separated. There was a gap between what the seller described and the real stuff.
3,They're Cut and Time Compressed!,"Just like the Space Ghost set I bought last week, these ""episodes"" are cut. They'veleft out most of the bridging material between the segments (such as the theme songs that used to play before the extra cartoons like Go-Go Gophers would start). This along with some time compression (Underdog sounds like Sweet Polly since his voice is sped up so fast!) on some segments and editing of other segments reduces the shows to around 19 minutes! What's the deal folks? I love this stuff, but can't any company find or create the complete episodes for any cartoon series??? Heck, I'd take the horrible 16-mm syndicated prints that used to show when I was a kid if I could get all of the material!"
5,Great Collection,I bought this for my daughter as she was getting excited about the new Underdog movie about to be released. I thought it would be good to see how she would react to the old Underdog cartoons. She loved it! I also enjoy watching the old Underdog episodes.
5,accept no imitations,"While I do share the frustration of you purists out there --- it would be ideal to have these classics uncut and complete --- I'm giving this DVD (and the others in the series) 5 stars. Even with any cuts that may have been made, this DVD set still retains the charm and humor of my childhood hero. I cant seem to find Underdog on any of the cartoon networks, merchandise & collectables are sadly too limited, and it's scary to think that the only exposure to Underdog for today's youngsters is the hella-lame Disney live-action movie. I'd much rather settle for a few trims here & there with this DVD set than accept a pale imitation being the only canine crusader out there saving the world."
2,Let's make it simple....,"Why can't they just release the complete seasons; full, intact, remastered like everyone else is doing.I'll wait til it's done right."
5,A good book...,"...that incorporates the Rune divination system with Chiromancy (the art of palm reading)!The first section of the book deals with interpretation and location of the Runic Palm, the Second section deals with Runic interpretation and delves deeper on this subject.I personally love this book.....but with any piece of literature, there will be those that disagree with me!"
1,What hooey!,There is utterly no connectiion between runes and palmistry. This is a total joke. Don't waste your money.
3,The ending was kind of awkward but maybe thats just me,I read this book like a year ago so I'm a little dusty on the finer details but this book was interesting if you wanted a different take on the typical King Arthur story I normally like King Arthur stories but this one I just thought was a little boring maybe it was a little too different for my tastes and I have to say the Gawen and Gawaine kind of confused me at times I tended to mix them up a bit probably my biggest issue with this book is that one of the characters is suppose to be a boy and then you suddenly find out that he is a she and then she gets married and its kind of weird cause through the entire story you're used to thinking of her as a boy so it was really awkward to me when she gets married it wasn't a bad book just not one of my favorites and I'll probably never read it again
4,More development could have been useful,"Although I figured out less than halfway through who Gawen was, this was an enjoyable book for the most part. There were some parts that could have been developed a bit more, though. For example, the ending felt a little rushed and not entirely convincing."
2,TERRIBLE!!!!,"This story is HORRIBLE!!! It just drags on and on, and nothing ever changes, Arthur justs moans about how he doesn't want to be king, we hear from Gawaine and his mom ocasionally, and Merlin's mysterious not-quit-an-aprentice. Yes, they are interesting characters, but all they ever do is talk and occasionally travel, they don't DO anything!!!! This story could have been pretty good if Yolen had added a few twists or even just more action for our characters, too bad she didn't. I will give her credit for the end though, it's pretty neat."
3,Good but not great,I began reading this book because I enjoy reading about King Arthur. I was not real impressed with the story line or the plot. I think Yolen could have been a little more inventive with this book. The end was good but for the most part the book was kind of boring.
2,"Old book, new title","I was so disappointed to discover that this was the same book that I had already bought under another name. It used to be called ""The Ancient Gods Speak: A guide to Egyptian religion."" This book in turn consists of a compilation of all the articles related to religion that were initially published in the Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt.For those who do not have access to either the book under its older name, or the excellent Encyclopdia, than this would be a worthwhile purchase. It covers many of the major aspects of Egytpian religion, though it also leaves out many. In terms of ease of reading, the type is really small! I found it extremely difficult to read."
5,Two misplaced Reviews,Please note that two of the 3 star reviews are for the wrong book. Obviously the authors of the reviews were just a little too spacey. :)
1,Mine is a Dud -- May not be worth the risk,"I got this watch in March. By April, it was no longer keeping time accurately. I always set my watch 5 minutes ahead of time. I went to bed one night and woke up the next morning, and this watch was 7 minutes behind time. I reset the watch, and a month later, same problem.The worst part is that I am not able to reach the Amazon.com warranty department to discuss this issue.I have had an authentic, from the store, Citizen watch for the past 12 years and have never had a problem with it, and certainly not a problem with it keeping time.Other buyers may want to consider the value of purchasing a watch from a retailer with a physical location so that if you have problems with it (who would have expected a TAG to not be able to keep time), you can take it in and have it handled professionally.This will obviously be my last purchase."
4,Elegant Swiss Quality,"Of course you can get a watch that keeps time as well as a Swiss watch at a much cheaper price but you can tell the difference in quality. Tag Heuer and this watch has a quality comparable to Omega. It really is an elegant watch and the right balance of not too big but not too small. Elegant but not glitzy a la Palm Springs. It looks in place dining or everyday and will last a long time. If you can get this at Amazon (when available and not always) you will get the best price. The Tag Heuer web site has stated:""TAG Heuer does not sell authentic TAG Heuer watches on the Web. Therefore, a watch purchased on the Web from any other retailer may be counterfeit, damaged, tampered with, or contain inferior parts.""However, because of this Amazon does offer a 2 year warrenty since the Tag Heuer warrenty card is missing when you get the watch (gray market). Four stars because of this."
4,Stamina 1205 Precision Rower,"Easy to assemble , easy to use , 5 levels for easy to harder workouts , easy to read monitor , easy to store ,good all overbody workout ."
5,"Compact, Solid, Easy to Assemble","Probably one of the best rowers I've ever used.It was easy to assembly, and looks and feels really solid.Lots of adjustment in the ""power level"" - from really easy to really hard.I'm 6' and it is definitely large enough (will easily work for taller people as well). My wife is 5'3"", and she finds it easy to use too.Highly recommended."
1,shocks last only 3 months,Worked well at the beginning but both shocks lost tension in little over 3 months of regular use. Manufacturer charges full price for replacement because warranty is only 3 months. Overall quality and durability not up to mark expected from exercise equipment.
3,rower,I think for the price that it is a good buy.It is light and quiet no need to adjust the volume on the tv while rowing.compact enough that I store it under the bed and pull it out for use.The only complaint is that it provides perhaps too much resistance. I am 6'4 210 lbs and I use it on the easiest setting. I hope that the resistance cylinders loosen up with more use. I can't imagine anyone being able to smoothly row on the hardest setting.I got it to get a work out during the the winter and with out a doubt it will leave you sweaty.
4,Great first rower,"Being 6'2"" tall and weighing 225 lbs I was surprised how sturdy this ""low cost"" rower feels. After 2 months use (30 min/5 days per week) it's still a quiet machine. I have had to take the ""comfortable"" seat off a couple times to clean the wheels, but it is easy to do and keeps the seat rolling smoothly.I thought the monitor was a waste of time and took it off. Using a digital clock for time and a 25 stroke per minute pace is easier then using the monitor. For someone new to rowing machines, this is an excellent choice at a great price."
1,Horrible,"Someone gave me a Stamina rower as a gift. I used it twice and the wheel broke. Fairly simple to fix right? I called the company and they were extremely hard to get through to and they constantly transferred me to the department that was supposedly going to help me get a replacement wheel. Then, EVERY TIME they transferred me I never got through to this department that supposedly existed to replace the wheel- the line always hung up. I've never received a replacement and called for weeks. I thought I might try to balance on the one wheel but the squeaks were too much. Oiling is necessary and I only used it a few times. The upkeep on the machine and the horrible service from the company were ridiculous. I am not sure if the rower I got was the same as this one but it looks the same and it doesn't matter- the company is not worth your time."
4,rowing rowing rowing,"Went together quickly. Works as expected. Foot rest is a little hard on the heal. Instructions were missing but quickly found them online. Took some experimenting to figure out which way to adjust the tension. The instructions didn't explain what is required to get the timer to work, but when we accidently pushed the seat forward, it began. Guess the instructions could be improved. When the instructions said to turn the frame over to install the next steps, the picture did not show the upside down frame so we got one part on upside down until we figured it out."
2,cheap shocks,One of the shocks broke at the weld the third time I used it. While I was waiting for the company to send me a new pair of shocks my husband replaced the shock with a 25 year old scwinn brand rower shock. Then the other shock broke and hubby put the other scwinn on. I've been happily rowing on it for over a month now and it does have a comfortable seat but I hope the scwinn shocks last because the replacements that the company sent me don't look any better than the original.
2,Sadly disappointed,"Sadly disappointed with this machine, low quality, and not much adjustment. I regret the purchase, and I have this item on sale now on Craigs List for half the cost, so that I may recover a small amount of money;"
1,I'm disappointed!,"This product is made very sturdy. But when you row, the adjustment knob to set strength keeps moving. You cannot continue to row in a strength you like. Basically, it's unusable for regular exercise."
4,Product,The product mostly works well. However it is very difficult to assemble and the feet straps are difficult to use.
3,gave away to Goodwill,"I hoped rowing would be a good total body workout, but as a 5'3"" relatively out-of-shape woman I had to set it on an extremely light setting to be able to go for 20-30 minutes, and even then I felt the strain on my neck muscles and my hands went numb (carpal tunnel syndrome) without feeling it much in my abs or getting a very good cardiovascular workout. Maybe I was doing it wrong or maybe I'm too short. One foam grip fell apart quickly and duct tape was not a good replacement, too sticky to the touch. Stamina did send me a replacement grip on request. Oiling helped the squeaking problem, but the machine kept shedding fine metal dust from moving parts, not sure what was wearing out but would probably be a problem if I had used it frequently."
1,worked ok for a month,"Worked ok for a month. Once a week I had to lub it with 3 n 1 oil to try and stop the squeaks and that's not the worst of it. The nylon guide wheels (4 of them) get so dirty that when I went back and forth, it felt like I was on a gravel road. It was not a smooth ride at all. I would clean and lub the track and wheels each time I used it. I could have been exercising! The electronics fell out of the housing with a small nudge. I took the machine apart and recycled the parts. That was the only satisfying part of the whole experience."
1,Pretty poor quality,"Purchased this for use in my basement. It got some light use for about 3 weeks. After that, I found that one of the rollers underneath was fragmenting, making a smooth ""row"" difficult.Long story short, I could not really figure out what the issue was as I was preparing for a trip out of the country. Trying to be a good citizen, I called Stamina first and was told that they would send me new higher quality rollers at once. After about 10 business days, (they had told me 5-7) I called back. The parts are on back order.The roller only got worse, and now is unusable.So I have a useless rower in the basement. Unbeatable sales will not take it back, and 3 weeks later i still do not have replacement rollers.I know it is my fault for not figuring out the issue (during return period) before I had to leave the country, but obviously I had a few things on my mind at the time.Stamina needs to get it's part supplies figured out, and I would not order from this company again."
1,"Stamina 1205 - Heavyduty frame, otherwise poor reliability.","This rower has a very well built frame...but that's where it stops...!! After owning it for over a year, four hydraulic cylinders required replacing due to cylinders leaking oil..! What a mess. Using the rower 30+ minutes a day, after about 2 months, cylinders are squeeking, then comes the cyls oil leak...puddles of oil on the floor. Every cylinder I've installed leaked oil. Good bye Stamina...!"
4,Great rower for the price!,"After reading the other reviews, I decided to take a chance on this rower. Set up was easy. The instructions were well written and every piece described well. The machine works like it is supposed to. Very easy to lift and place against the wall out of the way when not using. Very little noise from machine so if you are watching television, you will not have to have volume turned up loud. Overall, a very nice rower for the price and free shipping to Hawaii was an added benefit!"
1,shocks are too tight,"Bought the rowing machine for the quality and price of the machine. Machine took about an hour to set up, my husband and I tried to row the first right after it was set up and we could barely pull back the arms. The shocks were so tight. My husband ways 240 and he could barely pulls the handle bars back on resistance level 1. We called the company, they sent out another pair of replacement shocks. The replacement shocks had the same problem, too tight. Called the company back to let them know the new shocks did not work, thier answer to the problem was, ""keep rowing until the shocks loosen."" Now I'm returning the machine all together. Would not recommend this machine."
2,Broke after 2 uses!,I just received it 2 days ago and the shock snapped right off! I didn't even have the tension on high or anything. I couldn't believe it. I just ordered a replacement shock and lets hope it doesn't happen again.
3,Get What you pay for?,"Assembley was simple enough, visual diagrams could do a better job labeling parts.- If your tall its a pain to get situated in.- Resitance settings are terrible.- After the first 100 sets the thing started sqeeking unbareably.- Calorie meter is retarded, doesn't account resitance, just how many times the sliding seat passes a certain point."
2,Bad rower,"I am sure there are much better rowing machines for the price. I had a hard time assembling this thing and when I did, it was still 'shaky'. The rowing handles do sync when you row and the resistance adjustment is just terrible and hard to adjust. If you really want to better rower, you can pay a little extra"
4,"Good value, fits under the bed.","I'm pleased with this purchase. I was unwilling to spend a fortune knowing that most exercise equipment goes unused after a few months - and didn't want it taking up lots of room. I picked this rower based on the price and hoped that it would fit under my bed. It was fairly easy to assemble. It just barely fits under the 7.5 inch frame of my bed with the seat off (it slips off easily). I've used it vigorously for 5 months and am delighted with the workout and have gradually been able to increase the tension.A couple problems have surfaced over time:1) It squeeks.2) The timer/stroke counter display failed after 4 months; even though out of warrenty, Stamina quickly shipped me a new one at no charge.3) The shocks get HOT after a workout and melted the foam hand hold on one of the arms. I have to remember to keep the arms elevated for a while after I'm done.All in all, this has been a good machine at a great price which I continue to use regularly."
2,Rowing Machine,"This rowing machine does not work well for super heavy people. There is a weight limit on it, so pay attention to that before you buy it. Maximum weight is a bit lower than what product claims... Personally, I would not recommend it for use by anyone near 200 pounds. Perhaps 170 is a better maximum."
3,"some good, some bad","The machine works well and is easy to adjust. It is comfortable. It has not been particularly durable. The first week I had it, one of the hydraulic devices broke loose from the frame. Stamina replaced it with no problem. After a few more uses, one of the four wheels the seat rides on ""flat-spotted"". It will cost me 25 bucks to get replacement wheels. I don't use it a great deal, so I kind of wonder how well it would hold up under really aggressive, frequent use. Still, since it is so inexpensive, I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Good money's worth,"I purchased this rower because my knees won't allow me to run anymore.....I'm pushing sixty......the stamina 1205 is just what I needed. I have had several rowers in the last thirty years, and this one is, by far, the best. Putting it together was fairly straight forward, and took less than an hour. You might as well be lifting weights if you set this thing on a difficult setting.....I put it at about 25 percent difficulty and use it for cardio. I am up to 800 rows, and this takes about twenty minutes. My goal is 1000/day, five times weekly...then maybe.....maybe.....I will increase the difficulty levels. I feel I get an excellent workout, I am losing weight and gaining tone, and I feel better than I did before I started. I think the construction of the stamina 1205 is excellent, and I would have given the unit five stars, except I feel like I am going to wear the wheels out on the seat........but it hasn't happened yet. If is does, I will just replace them...this is a great buy."
4,smaller than i imagined....,this is a nice product for a baby... but a little small. my baby scoops the mat into her mouth rather than playing with the toys because the mat doesnt reach too far out for her to really notice the toys. especially when shes trying to turn the thing around. the mat can become tangled and i have to constantly straighten it. but you can also use the ladybug by itself. ive done that too. :)
1,not a good toy,"my kid hated tummy time so i got this. he hates this even more. my friends' kid, who likes tummy time hates it also."
3,A cute baby toy,"I bought this product in an effort to get my little boy on his belly more. When I put him on it, he likes it for about 2 minutes and then freaks out. He's a little over 4 months old and it's clearly for an older baby that can use their arms and legs better. I hope to get some use out of this in the months to come."
1,Not for my child,"I bought the Lamaze Spin & Explore for my daughtet, when it got to my home I opened it and set it up which was really easy. When it was all put together it didn't look like something I wanted to put my daughter on. I was afraid it was going to tip over. It didn't look like it would suppport her. If she wasn't on it just right it looked like it would tip over. I returned it."
5,held head up in days,"My newborn hated tummy time on the floor. Would lay his head down and just cry, just like my daughter had. I bought the lamaze spin and explore, and he loved it. Within days, he could hold his head all the way up for minutes at a time, and now that he is four months old, he spins himself around playing with the different toys attached. Great buy!"
2,Nice concept but didnt use much,I loved the idea when i saw it. Bought it for Christmas last year and my son used it about 5 times it was awkward for him being in that position for more than a minute. so maybe your child will love it but mine didnt.
1,"My granddaughter cried everytime we put her on it, she's 5 months","We had hoped this would make tummy time a happy time, instead it seemed to make her so mad and uncomfortable, I just put it back in the box after 3 tries even adding padding for her stomach. I do not recommend this for any baby, not if they have the same reaction like my granddaughter."
3,baby gift,"The deliver speed is good but over packing. Online store need to think a green and environmental friendly for shipping.My friend love the little gym. After baby grow out of it, it can be use for lazy Susan for dinning table."
1,Waste of my money,"My son was/is not interested in this product. He may tolerate it for a minute or 2, but that's not worth $40 to me. I was really excited about this, in hopes that he would enjoy his tummy time more, but that just was not the case."
2,Very uncomfortable,"I bought this playmat for my 8 week old and she hated it. Everytime I put her on it, she would get uncomfortable and cry. I guess it would work better with babies who have already developed enough neck support."
3,Lamaze Spin & Explore Garden Gym,I bought the Lamaze Spin & Explore Garden Gym for my daughter of 2 months. The toy said it could be used from day one. I was upset to know that is not the case. If the child is not capable of maintaining its head held upright it just soft of squirms and wobbles on the toy and cries for help. This toy should be rated 3 months and up not zero to 5. Other than that the price was great and my daughter really enjoys looking at the colors of the toy even if she cant play with it yet.Lamaze Spin & Explore Garden Gym
3,Mixed feelings,"my 4mo old loves the mat and cover...yet doesn't love the spin feature. He's ok -not great- with tummy time and I was hoping this would help. Sometimes it works for a few minutes, other times not at all. It also seems to bother his tummy a bit- can be a plus if you just can't get that burp out...after he comes up from this there it is! But again, he loves staring at the mat while sitting on my lap...or even if i hold it up for him to play with he is excited...would love it more if he used the spinner..."
3,"Nice idea, but not very practical","I loved the idea of this product, and could not wait to get it home. Once I put it on the floor, my daughter was quite interested in the different colored ""petals"" and the different fabrics and textures, but the twirling ladybug just did not work out. When she was young enough to need tummy time, the ladybug was very uncomfortable, and she would cry after less than a minute of being in it. It didn't matter if she was gently spinning or not, she wanted nothing to do with it. We took the ladybug off (hooray that it's not attached!) and she loved the mat. Now that she can hold her head up easily and is old enough to start scooting around, she's more interested in the ladybug, but it's not a tummy-time toy for her anymore. Without the ladybug spinner it's just like any other play mat - bright, colorful with different textures and toys to play with, but it's a bit smaller than standard. I'd recommend going with a normal-sized mat and skipping the awkward ladybug."
3,"cute product, isn't all that effective for us - yet","this is a really nice looking product but my son isn't enjoying it as much as i would have hoped... he still doesn't like tummy time. it is getting better though and he does spin around easily and does enjoy (for a few minutes anyhow) the toys on the mat. just a warning - when we first used it, i guess he wasn't positioned on the ladybuy properly, and he slid off head first onto the mat. he didn't cry or get hurt, but just a warning!"
3,Just okay,"It is a neat idea, but I don't think it is worth the price. Unless you find it on sale, it's not worth the money. It's just a piece of fabric with animals on it. You could make the same thing for much cheaper. Like I said, it is a cool toy, but for what you get, it's overpriced."
2,Not interested,I bought this for my daughter and she never liked it. She hated the base that you rest on. She did like the mat with all the various sounds. I wouldn't suggest this for anyone.
3,Good idea but my baby hates it,"I can see where this could be a good thing. My daughter is 6 months old and has had this for probably 3 months. She was too little when I got it. I try it again every couple of weeks. She is now almost 14 pounds and is 25 inches long. She just doesn't fit comfortably in it. I think if the ladybug was a little softer, she may like it more...it just seems to hard for her to lay on. I wouldn't spend $40 on it. There are lots of other tummy time toys out there that seem to be better."
3,Bushell North Star,"I recieved this for Christmas. I returned it the next day because the clip on the leg was broken. The new one was fine until I put it up and the clip broke. I am a photographer and know how a tripod works! I called Bushell and they stated ""some got through our quality control"" and said they will send out a new, improved tripod; however could not even estimate when it would arrive since they were completely out at the warehouse. When I went to put it away, the middle plastic support broke. From the brief momement I had with it (when it wasn't falling apart) the scope and locater worked. Note that although there is a ""lifetime warrantee"" on workmanship, the electronics has only a 1-year warrantee (see the fine print). I am a bit hesitant on trusting the mechanics on something that fell apart in my hands-""what's next"" comes to mind."
2,"kinda noisy,","This unit comes w/20,000 preprogramed objects in the sky but viewing them is not particularly easy due to poor lens quality.The motors sound like a flock of screaming banshees,but they will line up the preprogramed objects w/precision.I've had no trouble with the tripod.I notice the instuction book does not mention why there are two telephone type jacks on the remote.If I had payed for this unit myself I would have returned it."
1,"This title is not being sold as it's listed, I was sent ...revisited","I have seen a copy of the Festival 1993 release from Australia, what I was sent and the seller refuses to acknowledge that they sent me the wrongdisc is not the listed Feb 2008 release.What I was sent is a 1987 special markets best of release with the wordrevisited on the end of the title.Amazon needs to make sure it's sellers know to sell their revisited under the revisited title page only and stop giving Thorpe fans false hope of a cheap price Children of the Sun disc."
4,Children of the Sun,"One of the more under-rated rock albums. Mix is not the greatest- mushy compared to the original, possibly due to digital re-mastering, but still retains most of the feeling and intensity of the original. Plays well in a dark room, like most Floyd tunes. Excellent listening."
3,Wee Sing Silly Songs,"My children loved this tape when they were growing up. We listened to it all the way to Disneyland and back in the mid-1980's. Now they are in their late 20's and still sing these songs. My daughter sings ""Little Bunny Foo-Foo"" to her husband, and it drives him crazy (especially when she bonks him on the head!) Anyway, I agree that the original, sung by adults, was better than this version, but it's all that is available and I want my grandchildren to also grow up loving these songs."
4,The Handbook of Doll Repair & Restoration,Author is excellent on restoration of procelain or bisque dolls. Very little information about composition & wax dolls. No information about plastic or vinyl dolls.
4,Accurate and Needed but...,"Zinn does an excellent job of introducing readers to Goldman, Berkman, Most, Reitman and others. Readers get an accurate sense of their personalities and concerns, a consequence of Zinn's ability to adapt actual source material in the dialogue.The problem with play is that its intention seems to almost entirely consist in introducing readers to Goldman et al. Although that is a worthy aim, the play itself lacks the dramatic tension necessary to lend cohesion to its snapshots of Goldman's life. The play seems loosely organized around Berkman's incarceration and Goldman's erotic relationships. Because these events happened over several years, the play attempts to cover too much time and, consequently, lacks the dramatic intensity of a shortened time frame.Still, for anyone who loves and studies Goldman (as I do), this is a must read. It's clear that Zinn fully appreciates the greatness of this much-neglected radical."
2,Thanks but no thanks,"I wanted to buy more of these but I was turned off by the fact that they left the theme songs off. I like the theme song of these characters very much and am highly disappointed. Whoever made the decision to edit them out should be demoted. I've heard that there are bootleg copies that have everything in tact. Like someone else said, ""I hate to go that route"" but I want what's being cut out and will not pay for edited out merchandise. Sale lost."
5,Technodog,"If you're old like me you can't go wrong with these toons! The big Dipper, where Simon attempts to take over the worlds water supply, the gold bricks, etc. And all of the bonus toons between the Underdog episodes are pretty hard to beat as well. Go Go Gophers, Tennessee Tuxedo, And other of your old favorites won't disappoint."
5,Underdog Jumps Thru Hoops!!!,"I enjoyed it immensely. It brought back fond memories of my childhood. A ""Thumbs Up"" for Underdog fans and for those not familiar with the original show."
4,Underdog collection volume #1,"Great DVD. but I highly suggest just buying the ultimate collection and getting volume 1, 2 and 3. Much better savings. Your kids will love them."
4,Good for young skateboarder,"My son is 7, very athletic and afraid of nothing. He has been a novice skateboarder for about a year but has had limited exposure to skateparks and places where he can practice other than the driveway. Usually at skateparks I'm scared that he's going to crack his head on all of the cement all around him. We bought this ramp set as a Christmas present and he's used it everyday, for hours at a time, in our basement...practicing his ollies, his drop-ins and mastering his balance.We are pleased that the flybox is sturdy. We bolted it together because it did shift some. But it holds his weight well yet is also flexible to some degree. Steep enough but not too steep. Worth the price as a good starting ramp. Not sure how it works for more advanced skaters but we're happy with it. By Spring he'll be confident enough to add some pieces and try more tricks."
3,Could be more sturdy,"The screws connecting the ramps to the table ripped through about a week after getting it. Guess its not meant to be moved, but with all the skaters around, if we left it in the driveway overnight it would soon come up missing. Have had to use washers with the screws (which should be provided)to keep the whole thing together. All in all, my aspiring skater enjoys his ramp. I just hope it lasts!"
2,Busted.,"I loved this set. Clean, modern - matched all our stuff. Worked great the few times we used it last winter (we live in the south, so its not like we're making a fire all the time!) But first time we used it this winter - SNAP! the handle busted off the poker. I am extrememly disappointed and since it's been a while, there's nothing I can do about it and no one to complain to but blogging here. Too bad I can't just buy a replacement piece in stead of a whole new set. When I do I can guarentee I won't buy from here!"
3,Nothing to write home about,The story about a postmaster who illegally does a rewrite on a former district attorney's first book is cute but the author knows nothing about the postal service or the law. A little more research on these topics by the author would have raised my enjoyment of this book by at least another star.
5,Terrific,The Tent Revival Homecoming DVD is great and I have enjoyed viewing it several times. Bill & Gloria Gather are producing quality DVD's and CD's. They fill your heart and soul with joy.
5,Great inside look,"Really enjoyed this, really gave an inside look to the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, NC. That after seeing this video we decided to go and visit on the way to visit my hubby's family in Georgia."
1,Not for 9MM,"I love the version of this that I use for my 38 specials but I'm not a fan of this one. It should not advertise ""9MM"". 9MM fits extremely sloppy."
4,"Well, it is a good box","It is a plastic box, what can you really say about it. It works as advertised but 9MM cartridges are just a little bit loose in there. It is still a long shot better than a torn up cardboard box in the bottom of my range bag."
4,Ammo Case 9 mm Blue 100 rd,"I like this product,the best of it is the fact that is transparent. The ammo fits wery well and its durable."
5,Best boxes,Very happy with these 100rd boxes for my 9mm. They seem to be built very well and i think they will hold up for a long time. I now own about 10 of them and have had no problems at all!
3,JFM,"Purchased 3 of these ammo boxes for 9MM rounds. I own several MTM ammo boxes and am satisfied with the quality. The 9MM in the nose down position are very loose and wobble a lot. In the nose up they are more stable, but difficult to get the first ones out. The casing sits down in the compartment with only the smooth conical bullet nose to grab on to. it would have been a better box if designed for 9MM in the nose down position. They are ok for now, but I will be looking for an non compartmentalized box to glue in the plastic trays from the original 9mm packaging."
4,MTM 100 Round Ammo Box 9 mm Green / Black,"This is a nice product from Case-Gard 100, very atractive in the color combination.I'm so happy with this iten."
5,Works great on 9mm ammo...The hinge lid is excellant...,Was all I expected. I reload ammo and these work great for storage. They also stack on each other very securely .
4,Good for Trips to the Range,"Sturdy 100 count ammo box. I read other reviews that indicated that when rounds are stored bullet down they tend to rattle around. While true, I didn't find it that big of a deal. Once the box is closed they don't seem to rattle too much, and as I'm only really using them to take ammo to the range and not for long term storage, they are more than fine for my needs."
4,MTM 100 Round Ammo box.,"I like this MTM 100 round Ammo box. I can carry both 380 cal. & 9mm cal, 50 rounds of each to the range & it is very compact."
3,nice to have,I purchased two of these to hold rounds of 9mm. I take them to the range with me. I would have liked to put the bullets in nose down but they would not stay steady. You have to put the rounds in butt first which makes it a little hard to get them out.
4,"Holds the ammo, but not how I wanted it to.","The ammo case is well made and is sturdy to hold the ammo. I gave it 4 stars because the case wasn't able to hold the ammo bullet down. When you placed the bullet like that. It would be slant and wiggle in the hole. But other than, its a good buy. Just make sure you have the bullet right side up so it wont move. Hope this helps!"
2,royal dud,"Looking at the picture you think that this ""crown"" has points that stand up straight on their own. The reality is that it all flops over."
4,Nice Experience,"I appreciate the timely manner in which I received the item. I haven't been able to listen to all the tapes yet, but so far the ones I've listened to work well. There was one tape missing (The Special Preview of Vladimir Nabakov's LOLITA). However, it was not mentioned as part of the sale anyway.Thanks"
4,A good ghost story without the gore.,Finally a new ghost story that is not yucky. I'm so glad some one is making good ghost tale. I really hope they will make more movies like this!
2,Good acting and scenery,"The main actors and the scenery are great, but I never did get the point of this story, who these ghosts were, what they were trying to accomplish, what they whispered in people's ears, and so on."
1,Wish I could get my money back !,"This film isn't bad, the premise for the storyline isn't bad, the acting, not bad, but oh my god it is so very very boring ! You can get up off the couch, make a cup of coffee, catch up on a few emails, and you will of missed nothing, in fact you could miss 90% of this film, just watch the beginning & the end for 10 mins or so, and your sorted ! There no substance to this film & it shows, a male ghost staring at a woman for days on end .. Yawn fest !"
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!!,"This movie was so boring. By fare the worst movie iv ever seen. It had no plot and it didnt tell you who anyone was. I am so angry that i spent a dollar at the red box to see it. Seriously I will bet that everyone the rated this movie is an art student. Horrible film, your better off just sending me a dollar and I will burn it for you so you dont waste your life on this. Id have to say the best part about it was that it was only an hour and 20 minutes, even tho it shouldn't have gone longer then the title screen."
1,"Make No Mistake, This Movie Is Cheap, Boring & Horrible","This piece of poo starts promising enough with a lovely and ominous helicopter shot across a lake, ripped straight out of The Shining. Then we get an hour and a half of corny and nonsensical boredom. Super-low budget production values, no suspense, no chemistry between the actors, and Shane West wearing bad white makeup literally standing in a corner making a sour face.Please don't waste your time as I did."
4,Classic Gothic ghost story w/ some very original twists,"I love movies like The Haunting (original) and The Innocents, so when I caught this movie at a preview screening, I was in love. The online trailer doesn't represent this one properly -- it's a real thinking man's ghost story, with a ton of atmosphere and a really original way of drawing the audience into the story. Beautifully shot & cut, solid performances, intelligent writing, full of romantic and spiritual undercurrents, this one really sticks with you. A true gem of a thriller, The Presence is well worth the purchase!"
3,Interesting....,"This film was interesting and very well acted, but it failed to offer much in plot explanation. There isn't enough revealed about the characters and spirits to make this film and it's world fully understandable for the viewer.For example, every time someone uses the out house, a bird flies into the side of it and dies. Why?There is a closet door that when opened, slams. But it's not revealed what spirit or why. The lead character is aware of it, and makes a game of it, but there's no explanation why.There seems to be a whole lot going on, and had been going on, that is never really revealed. It's as if we are just permitted a peek into that world, and expected to already know what's going on, and has been for centuries.the one spirits does explain some, but it's really not enough.This is a good rental, but it could have been far better and far creepier. Just having someone stand around as a ghost and roll his eyes didn't make it scary at all. It was like watching a mime."
5,Fantastic,"Eerie, suspenseful gothic ghost story. A must see for everyone. In the vain of 'Blair Witch' set in the woods of picturesque Oregon..."
5,The Presence,Great movie full of suspense! Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. A must see if you love thoughtful thrillers.
3,Thought provoking,"One person's demons or actual ghosts fighting good and evil?? I might choose the former on this one and it could be both, but I'm still trying to figure it out because a part of the puzzle that doesn't fit were the birds hitting the outhouse everytime it was used and the ""good?"" angel putting the ring box where she could find it. Then there's the hooded figure that was in the boat that brought her and was again in the boat when it took her back--was that someone's else's demon they carry around or protective spirit, or hers?? I've read other reviews and even googled it trying to get some answers. I've pieced some things together but the premise still haunts me (pun intended). I might watch it again. I think I would have liked it much better if I understood it more. Maybe that's the idea--we all get something different from it. The scenery is beautiful though--more peaceful surroundings than what you are left with."
2,Amazon misrepresents this product - buyer beware!,"I just bought this. When it arrived, I was suspicious of the speed since it wasn't marked on the package, as most are. I visited the Dane-Elec.com website and eventually found the datasheet which says a maximum transfer rate of 3MB vs the 10MB on the product listing on Amazon.If that is fast enough for you, then go ahead, but I am giving a bad rating because for a 10MB part, it doesn't work as advertised."
5,Adorable Hat!,"Purchased this for my four year old son for Halloween (he is going as the Alice in Wonderland rabbit). I was afraid it would be way to big for a little kid, but surprisingly, the adjustable strap works like a charm! Quality is good and I know that unlike most Halloween costumes and accessories, this one will make it through the festivities and even be played with afterwards!"
4,Rabbit Hat,"This was a fun addition to a costume needed for an ""Alice in Woderland"" themed party. It seems much bigger in person than in the photos, so if you have a small head it's really huge. Otherwise a great product."
4,Excellent for Costume Use,"Purchased this hat for a white rabbit costume. When delivered the hat was packaged flat which worried me, but you just need to shaped it out a bit. The hat is of great quality and I'm sure it will last for years to come. The only thing I would say negative is that because it is a big hat and has a lot of material it gets hot very quickly. It's a bit hard to wear the hat comfortably all day or all night because your head gets so hot."
5,donald,"I love this CD.This music is the soundtrack to ""The Excorcist"" wannabe flick, ""Beyond the Door"". It has that sexy,funky,jazzy groove with a 70's downtown city skyline scene. When I seen this cheesy horror flick back in the 1980's, I also noticed how good the soundtrack was while viewing the film; and I always wondered if there was a soundtrack recording to this film. And now, after all of these years, I finally own it. The movie was a ""turkey"", but the soundtrack is lushfully great!!"
4,Amusing Movie,I remember watching movies like this as a child and finding them funny. I still think these movies are witty and clever. Jerry Lewis's brand of humor may not amuse everyone - you either find him funny of you don't - like any other actor.
4,Great for the price!,"The one person complained about the focus being touchy, but not if you get the tripod set up securely. I mostly use mine mounted on a cheap camera tripod and it works flawlessly. If you use the tripod that comes with it, make sure the clamping bolt is very tight and the legs are set on a very solid surface. That is required for any high power scope.This is a great little scope for the price. I love Bushnell products. I have been using them for almost 50 years."
3,Installation.,Missing key parts to put together and you will have to either bypass the O2 sensors or find a way to add them in the pipe.

2,Not what I thought,"The stool was not very well put together. There were gaps where the cross members were attached to the legs. I found better stools, for a lot less money (1/2 the price) somewhere else. I wouldn't waste your money on them."
3,"Sent wrong item, but return was easy","This was purchased as a gift from my wishlist. The cover inside the box was similar, but not the same as on the box or website. The one I got had a different pattern and holes for headrests. The local AutoZone refunded the purchase amount with no hassle."
4,Marker is marvelous,"I don't usually read the truly gritty novels, but this one caught my attention from the very beginning. Who could resist a novel that begins with yellow smiley faces on the walls of the Jackson prison and a convict who thinks he knows it all? Then there's the judge, a cocky personality who thinks he's got it all under control.The judge is a boozer & also does drugs. Unwillingly he goes to Alcoholics Anonymous and then his house of cards begins to tumble down around his head. Everything seems to be going wrong.Excellent writing, marvelous flow to the narrative and an insightful peek into the psyches of the various people involved. Highly recommended."
5,Very nice and beautiful clamshell look but some cons,PROS1. It is a very nice look .2. has very good features like a camera and can also rotate.3. It also has both bluetooth and WIFI that is a good for people on thego.4. It now has a low price than 2 years ago.5. will atract and impress many peopleCONS1. bad battery life (can buy extra battery . 3X longer also sold at amazonvery cheap.2. limited applicationsI think this is a very good p.e.o. and you shoud buy it if you like attention or really need it
2,nice,"Very nice gadget, the only complaints after using it for 2 weeksare: the screen could be larger, I realize that even though it is also 480x320, its only about 3/4 the size of the NX70's 480x320 screen. hurts the eye when browsing online, it could be brighter too.but my main dissapointment is: NO PORTRAIT MODE!!!! youre locked into landscape mode, which is a waste. It feels kind of awkward holding it horizontally on tablet mode with the jog dial on the bottomside.Anyway other than that the WiFi rocks."
3,Almost Snagged,"I was all set to buy this until I saw one for real. It's so small it's clumsy. The built-in keyboard is useless; it was made for a child's fingers. The screen is so small, I don't know how us baby boomers can even read it. Sure it's got alot of goodies on it, but you can get most of those things as add-ons with many other PDAs. I'm really diappointed. I thought it would be something that I could use on the road without taking my bulky laptop. Not for $700, not for $649 at COMPUSA, not for $523 on Ebay. Sony, please go back to the drawing board."
1,"Get real, $700 bucks! Buy a sidekick.","This thing is $700 bucks, and no phone? Come on. You could buy a Nokia 6800 for $150 bucks and do the same stuff, without the mp3 player. Or buy the Sidekick for $200."
3,OK but not great,It was OK but not great. A lot of talk but not so much on instruction. Was not able to find any written materials - just DVD. I believe you would be able to find something better and this is all about old blues type fingerpicking and not so much on Acoustic.
5,Beautiful Watch,"As stated by others who have reviewed this watch, it looks great with jeans or formal attire. I actually bought it as a gift for my best man and hope he will like it as much as I do. I do have another Tag, which I've had for over 10yrs now and have only had to replace the battery once with no other repairs necessary. They are very dependable and handle everyday abuse very well. I imagine you would really have to try to scratch the sapphire crystal. One thing about this watch is that the band may be a little small for someone with large wrists and it does not come with extra links. My wrist is approximately 20cm and the watch fits me perfectly. I have the feeling I may have to buy an extra link as my best man's wrist is larger than mine."
1,too heavy...didnt work......,"these 'snakes' are tough for the average drill to bite into and hold while pushing it through a small drain.plus thething is made too thick for average home-owners or apt owner's drain opening. while it does go in, its tough for the average drill and arm-strength to push it through.AND not drill through your pipes!get this....directions say to disconnect and/or unscrew your drain pipe! can you imagine? why not just call a plumber in the first place...whole idea was NOT to call a plumber......also water can get into your drill as you work (ha ha! just you try it!) this thing in. not good to get electrocuted!lastly, the one's that plumbers use are the only one's that work.i finally used drain opener - follow all directions. for [...] bucks at the hardware store why bother with these snakes? they are good only on tv shows or the zoo!lou"
2,cup didn't come with coleman logo,"It works fine as a coffee cup, but it did not come as shown with the green and red logo, which I thought looked nice. If I wanted a plain (no logo) cup, I would have ordered that. I'm a little disappointed."
5,A Must Read for party planners!,"I was drafted to help my cousin's best friend plan her bachelorette party and it seemed a daunting task! First of all, her friends were 20 years younger than I was, and I really didn't want my ideas to be labeled as ""totally lame""This book provided me with so many great ideas, from food to games, etc that everyone was on board from the start! I think to this day, the other bridesmaids consider me the coolest 40-something they know!I highly recommend this for anyone charged with planning an awesome bachelorette party!"
4,Tried for the 1st time....they're cool.,"You can definitely just chew them. I have really bad insomnia/mind races & taking 1 of these calms me. They say take a maximum of 2 & 2 is enough. It's not like a sleeping pill-melatonin FEELS less aggressive. Considering the price, I'll definitely order them again in the future."
1,Skip it!,You could go online and get the same pictures and read the same snippets of info. about GW. The publisher should be ashamed to charge $19.95 for this book.
2,A short read with lots of pictures,"If it's mainly pictures you're looking for, then it's okay. But if you want an in-depth book about Gretchen, pass this one up. Much of the text is straight from the Internet sites. It's a pretty good photo album type book as far as organizing the info. Young fans would probably like it. Makes a fair coffee table book. Glad I didn't pay the suggested price of $19.95 - not enough book for that price in my opinion."
2,Confusing and poorly explained,"I have been fascinated with Elliott Wave theory for many years and am always looking for books explaining it. My biggest criticism of this book is the fact that it repeatedly talks about the fact that price movements are more often than not difficult to fit into Elliott theory. The author fails to actually show what we should be looking at in the charts to apply the theory to practice. He shows us a number of simple theoretical charts of possible price movements but it would have been a lot more helpful to go through wave analysis for an index in practice showing us the pitfalls to watch out for. Granted, price action is always unique but such examples would allow the reader the opportunity to understand the application of the theory. The writing style is also somewhat superior which started to grate on me."
2,"Interesting Book, Somewhat Dated","An interesting introduction to Elliott Wave theory. The book is somewhat dated (published in 1995), and I'd recommend getting something published more recently, or perhaps the book by Elliott himself ""Nature's Law,"" although an old book, at least you'd be getting the theory from the inventor of the theory!The book is filled with opinions about what was happenning in the stock market in the early 90's, and many of his forcasts turned out to be wrong, making the book difficult to read. I really enjoyed the first few chapters, but got irritated as he went into more detail about the theory and made his forecasts.Who is R. Beckman anyway? In the 80's he believed we were in for a second depression. He hasn't written anything since ""Elliott Wave Explained."" If you look for him on the Net, he is nowhere to be found. In the book he talks about what a wonderful investor he is, but can that be verified? He's not even mentioned in Wikipedia!"
5,EXCELLENT WORK MASTERED WELL BY THE AUTHOR,"ROBERT C BECKMAN HAS EXPLAINED THE THEORY VERY WELL. ITS APPLICATION TO INDIVIDUAL STOCKS IS ALSO VERIFIABLE. HATS OFF TO ROBERT AND THREE CHEERS TO ELLIOT. I READ THE INDIAN PAPERBACK EDITION AND FOUND IT RELEVANT. I WOULD LIKE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ROBERT BECKMAN AS I FEEL THAT FURTHER STUDY OF THIS THEORY 'S APPLICABILITY TO INDIAN STOCK MARKET IS POSSIBLE AND I AM WILLING TO STUDY THE SAME. CAN I HAVE HIS EMAIL ADDRESS , PLEASE. MY NAME IS KUMAR D ADVANI AND MY EMAIL ADDRESS IS kadvani@bom7.vsnl.net.in"
4,Nice selection,"There are a lot of Irakere compilations out there, and most of them are very different from each other.This one is not very comprehensive regarding the different stages of the group, but it is comprehensive in the sense of reflecting the band styles perfectly.There's a lot that has been said about this cuban supergroup describing their sound as a mixture of cuban traditional with jazz and classical. The CBS compilation The Best of Irakere gives more importance to their cuban-latin roots more than anything, but ""Toda Cuba baila con... Irakere"" gives a much better perspective on the band featuring a version of Scott Joplin's ""The entertainer"", ""Estela va estallar"" (by the way, one of the very best compositions by Chucho Valdés) , variations on a Beethoven opera and a Mozart Adagio, and of course their best known piece ""Misa Negra""."
3,Good Introduction,"I am using the Religions of the World series to help introduce our first grader to how people are similar and different around the world.If you are looking for an introduction to the religions themselves, these are not great books. They contain the sort of information an upper elementary school student might give to a lower elementary school student. If you want to expose a child to basic ideas and help them appreciate diversity, this series is a good start. This book has more mythology than the other books in the series, but no topic takes more than one large print page.The colorful pictures are fun to look at, and about half of them are good jumping points for further discussion. I found the pronunciation guide helpful.Overall, it's not so much an introduction to Hinduism, as an introduction to the customs of Hindus."
4,Watch,"My first foray into the high end watch category. Love the look and the quality of the watch itself. The luminous hands and markers are the best I have ever seen and work very well at night. I also love that this watch is very narrow in depth. I am somewhat concerned about the band. While it is very light and comfortable, I worry about the durability. The rubber ""buckles"" that the excess strap fits under are also very thin. These have broken on similar watches I have worn in the past. The cost of the replacement band is quite high and I do worry about having to replace the band rather quickly. Time will tell. Would not have paid retail for this watch, but the Amazon price made it much more appealing."
4,Okay for a starter,"I bought this gun for 30 bucks and it curved crazy out of the box, but after using it for a while it started shooting straighter and harder, it broke after about 3 months. I would recommend the smith and wesson 1911 it shoots 315 fps and it holds 12 pellets. Well thats my suggestion so pick!Jordon"
2,No Conclusions,"Richard Case Nagell may have had something to do with the assassination of JFK, but this book certainly does not tell any secrets. Instead, it is just full of a lot of pointless conversations that lead nowhere. Russell writes too many meaningless details. It is full of Ifs and maybes, and even those are very weak.I do recommend JFK and the Unspeakable by James W. Douglass."
3,Not so Epic.,"The 5.1 audio is barely noticeable. The surround speakers are rarely active and when they are it's subtle. Since most of it is dialogue in documentary style, it almost sounds mono. It barely sounds like it is in stereo. The video quality is excellent. The stories are not that interesting. Also, unless you plan on viewing this in one setting which I doubt since it is over 9hrs long, don't count on using the episode selection menu. The episode titles are matched to the wrong episodes so you are constantly jumping around the menu trying to figure out which episode you haven't watched. This is already available at Best Buy as of this writing. It's not worth repeat viewings."
1,DVDs do not work,I bought this (not through Amazon) and the DVDs do not even play. I just played some other DVDs fine. Put these in and they do not work.
5,"""Cat"" is a must-have for anyone who likes jazz","Cat Russell accomplished all she set out to do on this CD, singing with an accomplished ensemble a variety of songs that make the listeners want to dance. I can't wait for a follow-on."
5,The best energy drink I have tried!,"This tea is the best energy drink I have tried! The flavor could be described as ""earthy,"" and may take some getting used to for some people, but with a little added sweetener it would be pretty good. I prefer it plain. I have tried the regular yerba mate, but the ""Pure Endurance"" far surpasses that one as far as giving me good energy. It puts me in a very good mood. It's worth every penny as far as I'm concerned!"
5,Enjoy in moderation,"A delicious and effective mild brain stimulant, Yerba Mate is a South American tradition spreading through the US market as an alternative to the caffeine bomb drinks that flood the market under the ""energy drink"" category. what I affectionally call the ""twitchy seizure"" category - Red Bull, Monster, etc.)Note: there is a substantial amount of information on the internet (take that for what it's worth) that suggests that prolonged excessive use of Yerba Mate can lead to some significant health risks. Not sure if there's any truth to that or not...probably best to enjoy in moderation anyway...which is what I would recommend for coffee and all the caffeine bomb drinks too. Let your daily morning pickup be a nice hot cup of camellia sinensis - plain black tea, enjoyed around the world by people that live healthier longer lives than us Yanks."
3,Expected more,"I was under the impression yerba mate was an energizing drink- that's why I tried this product. The tea tasted nice, but it didn't give me a buzz. Of course, your mileage may vary."
5,Nice,Ordered this case for my .308 rds. Dig the bullet tip protector feature and tray adjustment. Case seems sturdy and well constructed. Very pleased with my purchase.
4,Excellent for 7.62x54R,"Works perfect for 7.62x54R placed in the tip up position.My only gripe is the securing latch, make sure you double check that it clicks close before picking the box up by the handle.Going to purchase more for sure."
5,Voices Of Africa V.3,"This is a very good CD to listen to in your car, while driving or at home. All the songs are good and it shows how much we need to have african music part of our every day life. I totally love it and I am very happy with my purchase."
1,"Good intention, poor execution","I tried to really like this but it fails in several ways.Having read St. Faustina's diary (Divine Mercy in my soul) and studied Divine Mercy for several years, we found several inaccuracies; although one may say they are minor, there is no excuse on why they are not accurate.For example, Jesus asked St. Faustina to paint the image of Divine Mercy while she was in her cell, not while she was cleaning floors. Also, when Jesus asks her for the image, she was overwhelmed and concerned; the demeanor the protagonist displays in this movie is not in line with the disposition of a saint. Sisters don't wear make-up, nor do they keep their hair when they are professed.I do believe the intention was good, but it falls short."
4,"Littmann Soft-Sealing Eartips( Large, Black.)",I would recomond this product to others. I plan on putting them on my stetheoscope at some point of time.
5,Gift for a friend,I bought this as a gift for a friend who uses a Littman stethoscope. She said the tips were hard to put on but once there were fine. Quick shipping and free delivery.
4,Gets the job done,"Go for it. Soft, big and works fine. It's not as soft as the original ones but I can live with that.."
4,3M Littmann Snap Tight Soft-Sealing Eartips-Gray,They did fit my stethoscope and work well. I had lost one of the original ear pieces! I would order again.
4,"Like originals, but surely price can be reduced","Great replacement eartips. They are probably better than the original tips I have had. However, 4 Stars only because of price."
1,could not return,"Ear tips did not fit so I attempted to return them. The response from the company was:"" we do not accept returns under 50.00 dollars. So I had to spend more $ to order the tips from another company."
5,Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinc,"Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinction as predicated upon wealth, especially inherited wealth. Vickers, Work in Essex county page 98"
2,assigned reading?,god awful boring. potential to be interesting as it has many many many historical facts. problem is there are too many pointless ones.
2,Never received,I purchased for the holidays and never received - not even an E-mail stating the item was on back-order and would arrive later. Poor customer service from this company. I will not buy from them again - there are too many other wood working businesses out there to choose from. It only received a 2-star rating because I did buy some a year prior and they arrived with no trouble.
3,Fair introduction,"Taylor's work on Bismarck is strangely contradictory. While he often makes reference to issues in German history that only knowledgable readers would understand, he also deals with the subject matter in a very superficial manner. While I found the work engaging and quick to read, it left me with a lot more questions than answers.If you are looking for an in-depth review of Bismarck's life, don't go here. But if you want a quick read that deals effectively with the greater issues of Bismarck's career, then this is it."
4,Transformers Mechatron,"This is one of the non transforming transformers. Don't get me wrong though, it is still an awesome piece for a non transforming transformer. The overall design and color scheme are interesting mix. The toy can hold a basic figure and when yo press down on the nose it shoots forward, just make sure you don't have a figure on it when you do, they go flyin off the beast rider. THe toy overall is good design a different idea and for a beast machines fan its worth consideration."
3,An Intriguing Artist and Family Member,"Eva Gauthier was my great-grandmother and I obtained this article from another (public) source instead of Amazon. I gave it 3 stars because it is very short and does not even come close to describing my great-grandmother's rich and interesting history. There's a lot of other available information about how Eva is credited with giving George Gershwin his start, and that she was very close friends with Maurice Ravel (wrote ""Bolero""). I have a photo in my living room featuring Eva, Gershwin, Ravel and others at a birthday party she hosted for Ravel in 1928. Beautiful!"
2,Predictable,"found myself skimming pages to see if anything of substance was going to happen...repetitive and predictable too much dumbing down, readers do get the point no need to repeat endlessly. I got bored."
5,Don't miss this incredible book!,"The Editorial Review by the Library Journal has it totally wrong! Affect Psychology, as presented in this easy to read book, will open your mind to a new way of thinking about human emotions. The hardest emotion for the reader will be shame, and as shame is described it may interrupt your interest and excitement as you read. Press on! Once you really understand what he has to say, you will never again view your own or others emotions in the same way. This book's concepts are accessible, useable, and extremely applicable in today's crazy world."
5,A Forgotten 20th C Genius,"I'm a former foreign correspondent who has traveled the world and experienced many cultures. This is a wonderful book about the relatively obscure, but revolutionary, work on affect by Silvan Tomkins. In my opinion, Tomkins new framing of behavioral psychology is as great a contribution to 20th century science as the works of Darwin, Freud and Jung. Anyone who reads this book will be transformed and gain greater insight into their own lives and the social dynamics of the world around them. Nathanson is a good writer and the book is a riveting read. I've given it to many people over the years, and recommend it highly!"
1,Not 5th grader,This game is hard to set up and hard to figure out how to use. The questions are fun but to get there is confusing. The way to read and answer the questions is very hard to see through the red plastic covering over the cards. We had fun just seeing if we could answer the questions correctly but to figure out how to play the game with the confusing instructions was the hard part. I would not suggest this game to anyone because it was too difficult to figure out the way to play. Just stick to watching the show on tv and have more fun.
4,"Good Product, Dumb Game","I should have investigated the game more before purchasing. The product itself was just like you'd buy it off the shelf, but the game's concept and content left much to be desired."
4,Game review,This game is fun to play. My daughter loved it when she was younger. For the adults it is a little limited in the options and moves. I would still recommend it for the educational benefit it provides. I also like the gameCranium.
1,Horrible,"This game is horrible in every way. The gameplay is too complicated, it's more fun to just ask each other the questions, even the slots where you have to place the used card at the bottom of the stack is poorly designed.Do not buy this game."
2,Great....if you only want one person to have a turn!,"The rules for this game are ridiculous. As mentioned in another review, you really need to make up your own rules in order to make this a game for everyone to enjoy. We bought this as a family game, but the questions are just too simple for adults. We have played twice by the traditional rules; both times it was easy to reach the million dollar question without the other parent/sibling team getting a chance to go. Very disappointing for kids! I gave this a two-star rating because there is a lot of new trivia that the kids can learn from the question cards. I wouldn't recommend this toy unless it's offered at a significant discount off the retail price."
2,5th grader,This is NOT a family game for teenagers. I bought this game for a family christmas gift and the questions were way too easy. Much better for elementary aged kids.
5,Are you Smarter,My granddaughter is a HUGE fan of this show and she really wanted this game for Christmas. We played it Christmas day and everybody learned something.
3,Not Much to It....,"I like the show very much, but the game had complicated directions for something so simple...it was made ""cheap"" and only one deck of cards so you go through the cards pretty fast...it is not very exciting to play. To play you place cardbboard pieces on other cardboard places that are marked how much money you are up to when you get a answer...whoopee :( No board involved...speaking ""bored"" that is how we were, so we just pulled from the deck asked each other questions.. That was fun and educational to a level. Too easy for most educated people. Too pricey for what you get, needs more cards and something else, Jeff maybe?! I will watch the show...I would not purchase this product for the money."
2,Not smarter than the instruction writers!,"The instructions for this game are very confusing. Once we thought we had the rules figured out, we decided that the rules were stupid. Only one person plays at a time until they answer incorrectly, or win the game. If you answer incorrectly, then you can't win. If you win, the games over.We decided to just take turns asking questions, and made up our own rules. The questions were quite easy for the adults, until we got to 5th grade. My 5th grade daughter could answer most of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade questions, and some of the 4th and 5th.If you're okay with inventing your own rules, then it is fun and not too expensive."
2,It's Okay,"The game was confusing at first, because the rules are not explained well. We ended up just making up our own rules, because it is not fun to just have one person answer the whole time. We don't play it that much and I believe it is in a closet now. I would rather have the tv version than the board game."
2,not that much fun to play,"i was very disappointed by this game. i love the tv show and thought that the game would be just as much fun. but me and my family found it to be a huge disappointment. its very confusing, and the game could be over in a matter of minutes. not a game i recommend, or want to play ever again!"
2,frustrating,first out i want to say that we bought it out of a clearance bin at walmart for 10 dollars the are you smarter than a 5th grader Bord game was frustrating to take out of the box we had to punch all the little deals out and unwrap somethings and then we had to figure out what every thing was and we could barely read the cards 10 dollars poorly spent i wish we bought the DVD game
1,Poor Design,"The cards come with a little cover so you can read the answers, like the old red glasses you would get in a cereal box. The cover was too small for the cards so the cards tore when you tried to slide them through it. We ended up cutting it in half. The rules are overcomplicated for such a simple game. It works well if you use it with a tally system and a room full of slightly inebriated adults."
1,Not made from 7075 Aluminum,"7075 is weapons grade aluminum and is great for high use chain rings. I thought that is what I would receive, but to my surprise when I received that chain rings, they are made out of 6061 T6, which is a cheaper aluminum and not worth this price."
2,More promotional than guide,"At $34+ this "" book"" is very dissapointing. I really needed info fast on getting certain effects but had to go by the seat of my pants in staining a floor. This book is worth $10 tops."
2,Mostly useless,I didn't find this book very useful. You can find what is in it online and in alot more detail.
3,good for beginners,"This is a reference book for beginners on strategic planning.If you are looking for a more complete resource,this is not what you are looking for.A book for management students...Serdar"
5,I want a boat like thunder,"haha. I like thunder in paradise, the first of the three movies. I have not seen the other two.the one bad thing of note is the horrible missile at the end of the movie. So the ending really is no good because of that. anyway the movie is good.I like the music used through the movie, including the main theme.the movie is great, with fun characters, even when they are stupid, its so funny that it works.the bad guys are very funny and I like them. you can get a dvd of this or a vhs if you still have vhs.this movie is great for small kids, as there is no blood, and no really bad stuff. Its more comedy and lightweight.hulk hogan is pretty cool, and his friends as well.Man I would love to have a boat like that !! thunder is the bomb !!"
4,first thunder...,"...i read this one of the 3 has the only pinellas county footage-((cool, since i live here)); good show. it was funny w/silly fun, changeable action, scenery and stories to it. don't have time to tell it's story but it is worth buyin/keepin."
2,My Cat's too smart for the ScattMatt,"Typically I don't write negative reviews and my experience with the scat mat wasn't successful.First of all, I order the Scat Mat in the hopes of keeping my cat Kato off of our turtles enclosure. We have a large enclosure with a lid and window where we keep a Red Ear Slider. Routinely my cat sits on the enclosure and watches my turtle and occasionally will pounce on the glass, startling the turtle and send him back into the water.We placed the scat mat right over the window so our cat would not sit on it or peer through it. Our cat learned his lesson and just moves the mat to the side by touching the points that are not electrified.I'm not sure if my cat is especially bright or if this is a common occurrence. The mat now sits in a closet, useless."
2,Does not work as described,Either my cat is too smart for this product or it is just not designed correctly because it did not work to keep her out of certain areas. It quit working after a very short time too even though I replaced the batteries.
4,Excellent thought-provoking book for non-profit directors,"A great, thought-provoking look at non-profits with helpful, action-oriented examples and clear writing. What I like about this work is its focus on building organizational capacity - both as funded and prioritized by the organization itself and through foundation support.The authors provide the insight that non-profits all too often focus exclusively on expanding their program offerings without providing for the needed organizational capacity to really pull them off. As a non-profit manager, it helped me to think through the capacity challenges we face everyday - and to think of how to create opportunities for both management and foundation support for capacity building.The ideas they espouse will change the world of non-profits by helping to make them financially and structurally sound, while achieving high performance mission-driven results - if we listen!A great book! Read it! Enjoy it!"
5,"Great Design, Kid Friemdly",This is the only apron I've seen that is designed to grow with your child. The apron strings adjust to fit. I bought one for my son and all of his friends. Will accomodate 1 yrs to probably 8 or 10 years old. I love the prints.
5,Every parent should read,Every parent should read this book whether they are home educating or not. This should be the 1st book that any new home school mom/dad should read. It helps to build a strong foundation and reminds you why you are home schooling.
5,Do NOT start home educating without reading this book first!,"I was shocked to see that there was only one review on this wonderful book! For those who have never heard of it, it is a compilation of articles written by Chris & Ellyn Davis in the many years that they ran The Elijah Company. My veteran homeschool friends hang on to their old catalogs like gold for these articles but you can find them all in this excellent resource. The title is based upon a quote from Michelangelo ""I saw the angel in the marble and I carved until I set it free."" I can't think of a better metaphor to explain why we carefully craft the individualized education that is right for each of our uniquely created children! I should add that it is also an excellent gift to pass along to those friends and family members who still don't get why you have chosen to homeschool. This book was a tremendous blessing for me and my whole family."

5,What you've heard's all true!,"You mean you haven't bought it yet? You mean you haven't bought ANY of their discs yet? Read these reviews, brothers & sisters: Would we all lie to you? CHECK THESE GUYS OUT!"
5,Thunder,This is an awesome CD...If you like Thunder you will love this one. Every song on the CD is great!
5,How to achieve joy in your relationships,"Certainly, Judy does not teach how to ""fix"" your relationships with others or with yourself. What she teaches is how to proceed through a process of cultivating joy in all relatedness. Anyone who comes to her or reads this book hoping to ""fix"" things may be disappointed because the need to fix probably means a need to change and grow. I find that what is written in this book is really very practical and has enabled me to understand and move past my own repeated patterns that have led to disappointment in relatedness. I will admit, though, that those patterns have been hard to change, much like addictions, and it has taken some time for me to take responsibility for them. I now have great joy in resonance with others and myself, and better understand how to move from that resonance back to being centered and able to experience resonance once again--a much better pattern than closeness/boredom/anger/blaming!"
3,Raspberry House Blues,"Wow! I must say this was a good book. I live in Winnipeg so I thought it was neat how the book took place in Winnipeg. However, Winnipeg tends to be a relativly boring place so I thought it would be boring to too but I was wrong. This was a good book and my teacher and my best friend also have read it and recomend it. So please pick us this book, it's really down-to-earth and it's so realistic. The characters are so easy to picture and the book is great. So read on!"
5,In My Dreams You're Alive and You're Crying,"This album is all of humanity bottled into a shot of light through your ears. It makes me cry, it has made me happy, and it has changed the way I see people. I thank you, Jeff Magnum, even though this album took everything and anything you had to say. You gave me, and everyone else who has written reviews about Aeroplane, a reason to think we're not alone."
5,The Greatest,"This is the greatest album of the last twenty years. I don't care who you are, you won't convince me otherwise."
5,I Feel Sorry For Those Who Do Not Have This CD,"My first listen to this cd, I put it in the player listening casualy doing a puzzle book. Somehow I find myself paying no attention to the puzzles but deeply engaged in the lyrics of Oh Comely, wondering how I got there, wondering how a song could completely engulf my thoughts and mind. What a great song, what a great CD.Is it as good as all the reviewers make it out to be?? Yes. If you like deep, dark, intropective lyrics then you will love this cd. If you are into top forty catchy easy listening music then go check out Blink 182 or Jessica Simpson.With all the great music that is out there, so many are caught up in the few same sounds that have been around for 20 years. I just don't get it. Thus, I feel sorry for people who will never even hear of this band or the many other great under ground bands that are out there. >>>---Zen--->"
3,A decent album,"The past reviews talked it up like it was the greatest album in the world, so of course I was disappointed when I heard it. But it's not bad. Lyrics: good, melodies: wonderful, vocals... eh, not for me. Hey, you can't please everybody, but I respect this band and this album, and I bought another copy for a friend who I think this album is perfect for. Just make sure you listen to the sound clips provided before buying it."
5,Superb album,This album is just absolutly superb. The closest listening experience I''ve had is when I first listened to The Velvet Underground and Niko. A wonderfull almost creapy feeling came over me. Some people have complained about vocals? It seems to me that a lot of people have had these fake auto-tuned Brittney Spears-like voices drummed into their heads and they think that that's what vocals should sound like. Buy this album. You WILL NOT regret it.
5,One of my Most Favoritest Albums Ever,"This album is pure gold. Whenever I listen to it, I have to listen to it at least three times over. ""The King of Carrot Flowers Part II"" is really good for just belting out, even if you're not Christian and you're just doing it satirically. Almost every song is an ultra poetic reflection on sex, history, and atrocities. ""On Avery Island"" is also good, but I feel that this album is probably the most essential to any Neutral Milk Hotel fan. But seriously, just buy both! They only made like, two albums!"
5,Untitled,"WOW! This is one of the most touching records I have heard in a very long time. The production of the record is so unconventional and strikingly beautiful. While at times there is a lot going on, each song is bathed in pure pop genius which is well complemented by a strong foundation, with sometimes humorous, often ironic, and always very moving lyrics. If you are tired of the sameness of conventional pop records, fret not; the overall sound of this record and of the songs themselves make this album stand out in a way few others can."
5,Goodye Objectivity,"I've been listening to music for thirty years, and in my opinion, this is the greatest album ever made: better than ""Sgt Pepper"",better than ""VU 3rd"", better than ""Nevermind"", better than ""OK Computer"". You don't believe me do you? Just listen...just learn...just love..."
1,OUCH!!,"sorry to burst any bubbles here... but I guess we all critique ability & passion differently. This album NEVER grew on me like it did so many here. I find it to be a painful listening, not beautiful one."
1,Masterpiece?? WHAT?! Seriously???,"First off, I'm a musician... I like abstract music... So after hearing a bunch of people rave about this LP, I had to pick it up. Sounded like it'd be right up my alley! So I put the CD on... One word, TERRIBLE! I've tried to listen to this album numerous times but the off key whiney vocals and amateur songwriting put me off. Seriously, do people say this is a masterpiece just to be cool? It cant be because of the music.. OK, let me be fair, maybe there is 5 minutes worth of music on this disc that is remotely enjoyable. Do yourself a favor, save your money and buy something good!"
1,PAINFUL VOCAL TUNE,granted they make the most interesting and innovative music... but really when it comes to an actual song... you know the part where you have a good vocal melody... COMPLETELY LACKING.its almost tiring... now if they took away his vocals from the music... it might make a great instrumental album. there's no merit in his vocal tune at all.a lot of indie bands suffer from this... great instrumentals but unimaginative vocal melodies. i mean really thats what makes a good song a good song. it has to be the whole package. good lyrics and good backing music does not equal a good song unless there is a good vocal melody. sigh c'mon guys you can do better!!!
1,"Arrgggh, that voice!","I like Jeff Magnum's interesting (albeit twisted and inscrutable) musical ideas for the most part. The songwriting is good.It's just that the execution is lousy. It really leaves a LOT to be desired. I mean, sometimes I can live with a lead singer that doesn't have a great voice. I'm pretty adventurous when it comes to music, and if a band isn't really technically great but is still doing something interesting, then usually I'll like it -- great voice or not. But boy oh boy, Magnum's voice just busts through that tolerance threshold like a wrecking ball. This guy's voice is HORRIBLE with a capital H. It's so far off key most of the time that all I can do is cringe and punch the ""off"" button on my stereo. My musically-trained ears just can't take it.It's too bad, really, because I wanted to like this band. I like warped psychedelic stuff that takes musical ideas and twists them into something strange and interesting. But the guy just can't sing, and that ends it for me."
1,what the?,"Manic wailing and barely-in-tune strumming do not equal genius, no matter what. I've heard coffee-shop bards that sound better than this dude."
2,What the?,How did this guy get an album? Perhaps he created it since it sounds like it was made in a trash can. The vocals are horrible and every other word in the thesaurus for horrible. Maybe someone in india would like it. So send all copies of this cd on an aeroplane over the sea...
4,I think it's swell.,"I have no idea what this CD is about. Most of the songs are full of nonsense lyrics. It reminded me of GBV. I still like it. The songs are a litte rusty sounding, but most of them are catchy. I listen to it often in the car."
2,proceed with caution,"I first listened to this album a few years ago and wasn't very impressed. Every now and then I give it a spin since so many people seem to think it's godly. To this day I still can't get into it. I can see why someone might though. They have a cool sound here with lush acoustics and marchingband trumpets and a few nice woshes and such adding texture to the songs. Unfortuanety it can't hide the bland, dull arrangements and cliched melodies that plague most of the album. I give it two stars though because there are a few gems(the first one and Communist Daughter stick out), but not enough to make up for headache inducing, dull as a rock type of songs like Oh, Comely, Two Headed Boy, and Hollad, 1945. If all the hype has you curious, proceed with caution. Download a few songs first before forking over the $."
2,"Interesting, but not for everyone...","The sweeping scope of words used in reviews to describe the sounds of Neutral Milk Hotel certainly mislead the average listener. Neutral Milk Hotel is interesting, complex, and off the beaten path. However, one would definitely put this album and artist into the ""acquired taste"" file. This by no means detracts from the artist, but ""hypnotic, psychadelic, melodic, greatest"" etc.- these adjectives should not be used lightly- and are probably not the most appropriate for this album. Listen to samples before you buy to see if it is for you."
2,Vocals make this an unpleasant experience.,"This album was recommended to me by several different sources, including Amazon and my local record store, which had ""mandatory indie classic"" in a sticker on the disc. I tried it out a couple of times and Mangum's voice just takes away from everything else for me. I just could not get into this ""experience"" and traded the disc back in. I agree with the reviewer who says this is not for everybody. If you can get over the vocals, by all means enjoy this album. As for me, the vocals were just too much, or maybe not enough."
4,"Pretty, Oh so pretty","If you're looking for new summer music, look no further. Catchy tunes, acoustic guitar and a guy playing the saw. I'm leaving out a lot of other stuff of course. Think the 90's equivalent of the Violent Femmes. Check out the sound samples of the first three songs. If you like it, you probably should buy it.I say again, great summer music."
2,all style/ no substance,"bought this per amazons recommendations...this was the cd that made me go buy a new computer, one with the capacity to download music samples. while i've made my mark buying on intuition and research(1000+ LP&CDs)this was the worst, and i won't make that mistake again...way overhyped.."
1,"No. No, no, no, no.","The lesson to be learned here is ""that which is bizarre is not necessarily brilliant."" Nor is it indicative of talent."" Use your money for something far more rewarding - take your mom out to lunch."
1,It's Unique and Quirky(tm),"Absurdism is such a lost art in popular music that once the public gets their first taste of it, they're ready to declare their discovery the holy grail. Unfortunately this music is far too shallow and twee to justify the supreme heavy-handedness of sexual lyrics about Anne Frank, among other transparent attempts at ""twisted"" ""whimsy""."
3,"good, but NOT a 5-star album","I don't get the hype over this album. I'll agree, there is some really great stuff on here. ""Oh Comely"" is very moving, for example. ""The King of Carrot Flowers"" has a great absurdist appeal, ""In The Aeroplane Over The Sea"" is quite enjoyable, "" "" is pretty interesting, etc. etc. There isn't really a bad track here. Sure, Mangum has a fascinating voice and really knows how to use it (although some of the high notes in ""Two-Headed Boy"" make me wince a little); sure, these people are a far cry above most 90s pop; sure, the lyrics are fascinating; sure, the best songs are fantastic; sure, Neutral Milk Hotel can be seen as successors to the Incredible String Band. However, this is not the greatest music ever written! It's good, competent, interesting avant-garde songwriting, performed in such a way as to make the album a solid, if overlong, listening experience. But ""sonic orgasm"", as one reviewer said, this is not."
2,I guess I just don't get it,"I had bought other Elephant 6 releases from the Apples and OTC, so I thought this was worth a try, based on the reviews. I've listened and listened, and have come to some conclusions about it:First, some of the songs are pretty imaginative and have good, unique melodies. Mangum has songwriting talent. He also writes very weird, skewed, abstract lyrics that I can't figure out at all -- which according to most reviewers here, is a good thing, I guess...The thing that ruins it for me, though, is his voice. I can't get past it. I tried to like it more, but I can't. Unconventional voices are fine with me -- I like Bob Dylan, for instance -- but I just wince at Mangum's ""attempts."" OUCH!There's some talent here, definitely. The ideas are good. But the album, taken as a whole, is just not something I can listen to without wishing that the execution were better than it is."
4,"Damn, the other reviews for this crack me up...","...but that's entirely in keeping with Mangum's little Harry Partch fetish. An acquired taste, to be sure, along the lines of sweetbreads or veal kidneys -- rich, and strange -- but that's no reason to champion or pan it entire. Certainly, this is an album unlike any other -- but I question the endless, fecund Syd Barrett references, just because they are too easy: weird guy = Syd Barrett -- duh? -- with, meanwhile, no thought of how difficult it is to pull this stuff off in America, as opposed to in the pathologically nostalgic UK --So whatever, Jeff's got a bit of a whiny, annoying voice -- but: listened to yourself lately? What do you want from a songwriter, anyway -- Heaven or Brooklyn? I'll take Brooklyn anytime -- it's closer to the heart."
4,outstanding!!!,"poetic, moving. seems to betray the vulnerability inherent in most people. It reminds me of my youth..."
5,heartbreakingly beautiful,"I picked up this album because the cover looked interesting, a kid and a woman with a drum for a head. Hmmmm... Also, I was immediately won over by fellow Elephant Six Band Beulah (also highly recommended). I won't say this is the best album ever, or that it is musically significant, but i will acknowledge the power of the music in getting a response. The lyrics are hauntingly nostalgic, heartbreakingly beautiful in the way that very few things are. ITAOTS makes me want to cry, laugh and vomit all at the same time! How's that for emotional! Every time i listen to this album, I want to cry. Also of note, when I was younger, I was not the King of Carrot Flowers, but I saw a carnival exhibit with a ""Two-Headed Baby"" in a jar. The song ""Two-Headed Boy"" really really speaks to me because of that experience. A must for all two-headed human fans..."
5,a whirlwind montage of beauty and profound sadness...,"I'm normally not one to review a c.d online like this even though music is one of my greatest passions, but I believe in giving credit where it is due. Since NMH is not exactly in main stream music I think it is necessary that their small cult following give them a lot of appreciation. I personally think that NMH has had a very profound effect on the way that I view the music of today. There are very few bands for our generation that can actually make a completely original recording that has the potential of becoming a cult classic. I only wish that other bands would follow their lead to try to change the clone boy-band (Nsync, backstreet boys..etc..) face of pop culture music."
5,such an amazing c.d,"I was very annoyed when i read the review by Enertainment Weekly. I love Jeff Magnums voice. I am one to sing along with just about anythin but i feel that i wouldnt be doing the songs justice its the most intimate, look at a person through a cd that ive ever heard. My personal favories would be oh comley, communist daughter, and two- heade boy pt. 2 if anyone knows naything about the next album e mail me please."
2,disappointing,"I purchased this album after reading all the reviews on here saying that its a masterpiece. I dont really hear much of this in the music, in fact i find it to be quite bland if not irritating. There are few good songs, but the singer's voice kills them. It's like the band is trying to hard to be something they cant be. Musically it is very simple. If I were you I'd pass on getting this album and check out other bands like the microphones or olivia tremor control. I spent 12 bucks on this album that I'll probably only listen to a couple more times. All the songs sound alot alike and they lack complexity. It's like the quitarist only knows how to do cheesy chords. i dont consider it to be very emotional at all like alot of people who reviewed it. It's really just a bunch of badly written songs with a singer who is painfull to listen to. if this is what you look for in music than by all means buy the album. one of the worst albums I've bought in a long time."
1,"One star for being ""trippy""","Not really any good or memorable songs and the clever, distorted alt-folk cliches really wear thin quickly. Some ""songs"" are almost unlistenable but boy, are they ""alternative"". Listen before buying. Or buy an Elliott Smith album, you get songs. With singing..."
1,these guys are horrible and pretentious,"I work for a radio station. These guys were all the rage a few years ago, so I was sent out to a concert to get the inside scoop. I hated the show. The guy is talentless: he can neither sing nor play the guitar. The lyrics are strained and mock-absurdist. The guy is visibly aching for attention--""Don't you people think I'm weird?"" When I interviewed them after the show I felt like pissing the whole time so I was extra-irritated by things I would normally overlook--i.e., the guy kept scratching his hair like some eccentric and I was on the verge of spitting in his face. So, lucky me: I was asked to review this album by the station. . . you can imagine the long harangue I launched against this godawful band. But nobody seems to mind me."
1,Whoooaaa!,"Hey World,Guess I'm the minority here, possibly out of my element? Just cant stand his over pushed voice and the repetative strums. Lastly, and most important his sick demented lyrics about little boys! Who would back this album??? This songwritter is truly a sick man who needs help. Shame on all the reviewers who cant spend time to scratch the surface. Sad sad sad sad!!!"
1,utter trash,"This ranks as one of the most God-awful pieces of pretentious trash I have ever had the misfortune of hearing. The terrible vocals some of the songs had just made me cringe. Overall, one of the most overrated albums I've ever come across."
3,Very good but not earth-shattering,"I bought this on the strength of other reviewers' hyperbole. And while I won't say that it was money entirely wasted - on the contrary, it is a quirky and likeable concoction, sort of Richard & Linda Thompson (circa 'I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight') spliced with mid-period Mercury Rev; an unusual pop experience - nevertheless, my universe is emphatically NOT turned on its head. Buy and enjoy...but let's keep things in perspective."
5,A Devastating Record,"An album like this comes along once in a very long while. It is the rare artist that is willing to open themselves up to the world to the extent that Jeff Mangum does on this recording. Aeroplane is meant to be listened to as one piece, and it is in this context that each song generates it's stongest emotional impact. Not everyone will be able to handle an album this emotional and most will turn away because of a subconscious fear of getting too close to another human being that they don't even know. Keep an open mind and listen to Mangum pour his guts out on all over some tape from 1998. He will paint pictures in your mind, some ugly and some beautiful, but all stemming from pure genius. A singualr vision from an artist that is missed greatly. A must own for those who enjoy rock and roll that is difficult and moving. 5 Stars."
4,Mangum's opus,"A quintessential lo-fi masterwork of acoustic power and unrestrained vocal, this highly influential album helped pave the way for the broken-boy aesthetics of Bright Eyes and literate ballads of Decemberists to be the prominent independent music it is today. Sure, some of the production should have been tuned up a bit even if the overall quality of hearing the performance right in front of you is partly why this album still shines bright, but mostly it is because the sincerity and simplicity coupled with thematic ambitions preserved this track listing better then it ought."
5,masterpiece,"i have the vinyl version. classic cover, classic album.jeff magnum is genius.your collection will look lame without it. don't let that happen."
4,"Vinyl, WOW!","I have heard this album before but never like this. I can now see why the vinyl version is so popular. The first time the bass kicks in on King of Carrot Flowers, I was shocked! It sounds so full and natural. If you're a fan of some of the songs, do yourself a favor and get the vinyl version."
5,It's awful.........ly great!,"Sure, I consider myself enlightened and open-minded. I listened to the samples and didn't get it. But one review struck me: ""accept it on it's own terms."" So I bought it.When I popped it into my home stereo and heard the grating voice of Jeff Magnum, especially on the second song, I had to quickly turn the volume down in embarrassment. Awful.A day later I played it for my 14 year-old son saying ""so I missed on this one...isn't it awful?""The next day I listened to it in my car. Still awful, but there was something...A couple of listens later it clicked. And it became the most exquisite CD I've ever heard.It's been about two years since then, and it has become my most cherished musical treasure. And the funny thing is, my three kids -- 16, 14 and 12 years old have all downloaded it on to their iPOD's. They feel it too.I'm just very glad that I ""get it"" and that I've passed it on to another generation. Truly a ""life-changing"" musical maseterpiece."
3,I'm stuck in neutral with this one ; ),"Mabye I was expecting too much from this album,I looked at the reviews and was expecting my head to explode from the sheer greatness that is Neutral Milk Hotel. I only got semi-stiff from this one. Don't get me wrong it's an ok album with some decent tunes but nothing jumps out and grabs me. My advice for this week is to buy anything by Radiohead and the Cap'n Jazz anthology, it rocks!"
4,New fan,"I am always on the look-out for music new to my ears and found a gem in this intelligent and fun record. Lyrically heartbreaking and sarcastically sweet it challenges the listener to have fun and feel melancholy at the same time. Love it. I will wholeheartedly recommend this to friends and family alike, although with the understanding it's not for all! Fans of the likes of Dirty Three or Tindersticks will assuredly love it as I have! Here's to new finds...."
2,This is the disc that everyone's been raving about?,"I've just purchased ""In The Aeroplane..."" and must confess to more than a little disappointment. Jeff Mangum's vocals are so out of tune on many (most? - all?) of the tracks that attention is diverted from what seems to be a fine batch of catchy, adventurous, eccentric Southern pop tunes. So, while that opinion has been formed solely on the basis of a single listening, and thus is subject to change, I must admit to a strong preference for The Apples (in stereo)'s comparatively well-sung ""Tone Soul Evolution"""
1,"whiny, spastic and whiny","Without wasting too much breath... this album has nothing original or inspiring to offer.. Remember in that movie 'Deliverance' when the hillbilly says ""squeal like a pig""?? I think the vocals of Neutral Milk Hotel (whatever that is supposed to mean/aside from random word association) SQUEAL. Seriously."
3,Meh.,"Neutral Milk Hotel's 1998 album seems to have gotten a second wind over the past two or so years. Judging by some of these elitist reviews, the culprit of influence is none other than our good buddies over at[...], every pretentious hipster's favorite website in the whole wide world.I mean, just LOOK at some of these reviews. You'd think these people found Jesus or something. But, no. It's just a bunch of skinny nimrods with bed-hair collectively tainting whatever reputation this album had with their masturbatory essays. I agree with the reviewer below me: GET OVER IT, PEOPLE.The truth is, this isn't a great album and it's not a bad album. It's just something good to listen to every once in a while. Hey, at least it's better than the Shins (who outright suck).The thing is, if this is your favorite album, you desperately need to discover more music."
2,Corny,"The only song I really enjoy on the album is ""Untitled""...because Magnum finally shuts the hell up.Yeah, ""Fool"" is an instrumental, too, but it's pretty boring.Very annoying overall."
2,Not real Air Force life,"As an Air Force spouse, I hope nobody uses this as their only view of military life. I shuddered at some of the generalizations. The characters are drawn broadly, and are stereotypes. The slutty secretary and female pilot, the drunken wife, the overbearing general's wives, the wives without a life beyond the air force - what sad, limited lives these authors must lead as military spouses. There is no ""typical"" Air Force wife, and this book reinforces the negative stereotype of officers' wives that so many people ""buy into"". The mystery itself is okay, it was a fun read in that respect. IT IS NOT A WINDOW INTO AIR FORCE BASE LIFE!!!!!!"
4,universal splint,Works well except plastic splint keeps coming out in the middle of the night. I wish it had a button to close opening so splint would not come out
3,not the lambchop I know and love,"I was quite dissapointed by this effort, it does not live up to the laid back symphonic sound of lanbchop..the first couple of tracks are a bit...hmmm...different.the rest of the album is the same old stuff, not bad but not progressing."
4,YOU MUST BUY THIS RECORD,"I heard a song from Mike Younger on Napster.com and fell in love with the music. There is something about the voice, the lyrics, the passion that comes through in his songs that I have not heard in a long time. I have never bought an entire CD from an artist that I heard on iTunes or Napster but my friends, I bought this one. This artists is a sleeper, let's get him in the limelight and show the music industry what they are missing. Mike Younger is what we want to hear...honest, raw, sexy! Spinning our thoughts into his stories...I wonder if he is married or if he wants to get married :-)"
1,I wish I could rate this less than 1 star,"This audiobook is so bad I'm trying to get a refund from Audible.com. The title and descriptive copy is completely misleading, as it has nothing to do with network marketing. It is entirely about ""party"" selling like Tupperware (where they came from), Mary Kay etc. Even if you are a woman interested in this kind of marketing, this program is worthless.

4,Good story of old time firefighting.,"Tried it on the under-five grandkids, but they didn't seem to be as attracted to it as they would have been to a fire house dog story. But, it's factual and informative, and think they'll find it so as they get a bit older."
4,Get up to speed on Plumbing Basics!,"If you want to know how to fix plumbing fixtures (sinks, toilets, etc.), this book is for you. It also is for you if you want to put plumbing into your new house, or do a rehab/add a bathroom, etc. My use is for both. I checked this book out of the library and realized I had to have my own copy (spills & what not on library books do not please librarians).It has very clear, colored illustrations to show how pipes run, what tools you need, and what the different plumbing parts look like. The illustrations are excellent and easy to follow.It is written in simple English. It has step by step illustrations for certain projects. This book won't tell you a lot about plumbing codes specifics (you need to check your local and state codes).Most of all, for the newbie to plumbing, it starts out with an overview with good illustrations that show how water comes into a house, goes through a house, and leaves a house. ()"
2,Glass cover separates,"I had the same experience as one of the reviewers below. Three or four of my 60w Sylvania P16 bulbs, which are labelled 1898 and appear to be the same exact design as this one, had the hot glass cover separate and come crashing down and shatter all over the kitchen. On the other hand, the remainder of these spot bulbs, which we have all over the kitchen/ dining area, have lasted 3 or more years with daily use, so I am torn. I have bought a new brand now as they finally burn out or fall and have to be replaced because I too worry about what would happen if a person or something flammable were hit by one of the scalding flying shards of glass. I doubt the new brand will last nearly as long though."
3,Nice beam but flickers if there's any vibration.,"I got this to replace the halogen lamp on my milling machine. The light is a nice, intense well focused beam but any vibration makes the light flicker.If this were used in a fixed location, it would be fine."
4,Hardcore? Emo? Punk?,"Before Today is one of the few bands that can combine different types of music. Being that I'm from San Diego, I decided to check these guys out. My favorite tracks are The Process ofLosing and Gaining, Failure is Relative, and Staring at Backgrounds.If you're into Boys Night Out, Dead Poetic, Fear Before the March of Flames, or Rufio, you should check these guys out."
4,Nice Cat !,"Got a complete system via Amazon, new converter back. Worked out nice. This piece was used for an exhaust job on my 87 Astro van with a 4.3 V6. Did not fit quite as nice as I'd like, but I am nit-picking. Don't waste your time trying to get the Walker exhaust part numbered clamps. Just get the standard or heavy duty exhaust clamps. Some of these were pretty skinny in diameter and must be prone to rust sooner."
5,This WORKS!!,"Mr. Garrison reports it took 60 tries to entitle his book. It did attract me--after 20 years. Too late for me; fortunately, not too late for my students."
2,Save Your Money,"I do not recommend the purchase of this dvd. We anxiously awaited its release as it was touted as having a new Snow White cartoon. Instead of creating a brand new cartoon, Disney used excerpts from the Snow White movie and rearranged them along with narration to create a new story. At times, the characters are pictured talking on screen in still shots with no mouth movements. There are some interactive features in the Snow White story which ask the child to make selections with the remote. My daughter is 4 1/2 and doesn't use the remote. I helped her make the choices, but she found it to be frustrating. The Jasmine cartoon is one that Disney still shows in The Aladdin cartoon series reruns. The Little Mermaid cartoon is also from the Little Mermaid cartoon series that still runs on Disney. My daughter had seen the Aladdin and Little Mermaid cartoons on television previously. This was a disappointing waste of money."
1,worse than the first,"even worse than #1, my daughter sked me to turn it off and take it back the library. which I was happy to do."
1,Disney Should Be Ashamed of Itself!,We received this as a gift for my 2 1/2 year old and it is awful. I expected much more from Disney since they have always put out exceptional products and movies. The Snow White version reminds of watching Godzilla with the uneven lip movements to her speech. With today's technology Disney could have produced a much better DVD. Do not waste your money.
5,UNABOMERUNABOMBERUNABOMBERUNABOMBERUNABOMBERUNABOMBERUNABOMB,"If you ever want to get inside the mind of the Unabomber, or inside the investigation, this book is recommended. Learn of the Unabomber's personal life, his obsessions that led him to become one of the greatest threats to our postal services. Included is the Unabomber's Manifesto, his letter to our country, filled with his anger, insecurities, prejudism, protests, and ideals. John Douglas does a well and organized profile on Ted Kachinsky. -Vanissa W. Cha"
5,Supurb quality and sound,"I have had an AA20 for about a year, and find this instument to be of extremely high quality. It is constructed of the finest materials, and is very well finished. The tone is warm and true. The intonation is absolutely perfect. The action is low and comfortable. It is quick and easy to tune, and stays tuned. The tuners are of excellent quality. I find it's sound and overall quality hard to distinquish from the much more expensive versions from Aparicio or other manufacturers. It should last a lifetime with proper care."
4,Would have liked it with pictures,"Lots of good recipes but not a picture in the book if you like a picture now and then this ones not for you, Now if you can get along without them its a good book lots to make easy I seem to have most of the ingredients right in the pantry. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a few pictures."
5,Perfect combination of style and substance,"This is an awesome watch. It has the right amount of bling to make an impression but never goes over the line of good taste. The functions work exactly as they are supposed to. The bracelet is very comfortable and is lightly brushed giving it an elegant appearance. I intended to spend a lot more than this much on a watch to replace a 7 year old Cartier. But when I looked around no quartz from Omega or Breitling really did it for me. Other Tags are nice - like the Link Chrono and black face Aquaracer - but this one hits the mark better for me personally.Many watch afficianado's dislike quartz but I can't live with a watch that loses 15 minutes every 6 months. And some will say Tag is more about marketing (Tiger Woods, etc.) than excellent timekeeping. That's OK with me. This piece has the great looks and finish a quality timepiece should. And the only time I have to reset it is when I change timezones or for daylight savings time."
3,Beautiful Quality eh.,"I love Tag watches and own another, I got this one as a graduation gift I'd say 2 years ago, I wear it almost every day, however first the battery died in like 6 months of getting it, which they said was average for this watch, however to get the battery replaced on a Tag you have to send it to them they fix it then send it back, a bit of a hassle, My second problem is the paint on the outside where the numbers are is starting to peel off leaving half the numbers black and half silver which is rather unsightly. And within the last two days another problem has emerged the Chronometers don't line up to where they should be and I don't mean slightly its like 3 seconds off which looks funny. The watch is really pretty though and this summer during summer break I waited tables and when people would see it they would comment to how pretty it was, so it is a gorgeous watch just I've had a few problems with it."
5,GREAT DEAL,"This watch is fantastic. It was a great buy at over $300 off retail. I have been out of the counrty to tax and duty free places and still have not found a price within $80 of this one. The watch is beautiful and is a great piece to own if you are a fan of Tag Heuer or racing. I prefer it to the normal F1 watches because it has a classier look to it, some of the normal F1's lose a lot with the black plastic all over the face. If you are looking for an expensive, classy, Limited Edition watch at a cheap price, this is your best bet. I have had mine for over a month and a half and have had no problems!"
3,Coaxed into watching...,"This movie is some humoristic story of a football business with a family touch.A weak offspring of ""The Last King of Scotland""."
2,Where's John Simm?,"The only reason I watched this movie was because I thoroughly enjoyed John Simm's reading of the audiobook. Why wasn't he signed to play the role of Clough? Perhaps if I hadn't heard the audiobook first, I might have given the movie another star, but I can't help but find Simm the better Clough (in addition to every other voice).If you haven't listened to the audio version, it would be well worth your time to do so."
4,I don't even like sports,"(Let's say 3.75 stars).I decided to go for this because I love all things British, particularly those from the period (1974) portrayed in this movie. Also, I just adore Colm Meaney. I though it was sweet and thought-provoking. Martin Sheen (no, not *that* one) is always fun to watch because he's so dedicated to his roles."
4,The Danmed United - very enjoyable,I really enjoyed this film. Great performance by Michael Sheen. I would recommend it to anyone with memories of the era.
3,Dangerous,Michael Pare' stole the show.He is so gorgeous but honestly this movie could of been made more tastefully!!!!.And less bloody!!
5,Great price,We replace this item about 2 times a year. I shopped this on amazon by part number and it was a great saving compared buying it locally.
1,Not what I expected,"This is a spare part for a Robinair machine, I thought it was a in-line filter used between the manifold and the recover unit."
5,Great way to introduce Classics...,Great way to introduce my students to classics that they would otherwise not read on their own. There is not enough time to teach a novel the size of Moby Dick but the movie does get them an overview of the characters and story.
4,Good movie,"Good movie, different perspective for my 9th graders. They enjoyed the different spin on the movie from the book. Would use again."
4,DVDs for the Classroom,This DVD is a great collection for schools. The cost of the dvd was excellent value for a literature class and government class.Using it for school only it has been a great resource to enrich the lessons.
5,Extraordinarily well written and comprehensive,"Rarely do I encounter a book of such technical quality that also is a pleasure to read. Bishop moves through sometimes difficult topics in a clear, well-motivated style that is appropriate as both an introduction and a desktop reference on neural nets. Definitely on the ""A list.""Bishop chose to not include discussions on a number of topics that might have diluted his focus on pattern recognition (for example, Hebbian learning and neural net approaches to principal components analysis). I think that these choices greatly strengthened the integrity of his presentation.I would love to see an updated edition with a discussion of recent results in statistical learning theory, kernel methods and support vector machines."
1,Sorry I bought this on CDROM,"I'm sure all the data I want is here on this CDROM, just as I have always been able to locate it in the hard copy book, but Adobe seems determined to prevent me from finding the stuff I want. Whoever sold the U.S. Government on Adobe PDF files did all of us a disservice. I'm trashing the CDROM and buying the paper book."
1,WARNING- MADE IN CHINA,"I have a decent collection of fishing rods, mostly G-LOOMIS which are made in the USA. I liked the lightweight feel of this LAME-iglas rod so I purchased one of these surf-king rods 4 years ago and I rarely used it. I may have used it about 13-14 times here on the Monterey Bay coastline fishing for stripers.One morning I hooked into a decent sized fish and the rod tip snapped causing my line to fray and cut. Needless to say I lost the fish.I recently sent the rod to LAME-iglas and they said the rod only had a one year warranty and they wanted to charge me $45 for the repair.After speaking to their ""customer service"" representative he advised me that LAME-iglas rods are made in CHINA. I was shocked and appalled. I will NEVER EVER buy this chinese made garbage again and I will warn all other fisherman to buy only quality American made G-LOOMIS rods."
1,BORRING & SLOW READING,"I understand that we all have to earn a living, but why bore probably thousands of readers with this sappy, overly and uninspired attempt at sentimental writing? It seems obvious after reading this book that the author was just playing at readers' emotions in the pursuit of delving into our pocketbooks. The author scribbles a never ending ramble of events which have little or no relation to one another. While I respect the real life(???) tradgedies the author relates to the reader, I must say this book was for the most part, slow, daunting, uninspired/ing, and tiresome reading."
2,A novel idea for a novel,"This crazy romp across the country in a race to beat Lewis and Clark was amusing. A brain-damaged Revolutionary war hero and his nephew, an artist, set out to the Pacific. I found the book quixotic and off-beat, but it did not hold my interest.Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of Crestmont"
5,The True Account:A Novel of the Lewis & Clark & Kinneson Expeditions,"I am very interested in the Lewis & Clark expedition, I have read a lot of books about it. I read this because I admire Howard Mosher's work. I was not disappointed! This is a wonderful tongue in cheek look at the expedition, a great read and fun! I'm sure you will enjoy it!"
2,UNRELIABLE,"This phone periodically would not ring when people called me, and then I'd get a message notification hours, sometimes days later. Perhaps you could blame the carrier, but.... during conversations the phone would just die, and then mysteriously come back to life several minutes later. About the 4th time it happened, it never came back on, and could not be repaired so it was replaced with the same phone. It was then that I learned that all my keepsake photos and videos on the phone were lost forever in addition to all my ringtones and contacts. The phone was only 10 months old and had never been mistreated. LG was of no help and offered no compensation. I would not buy another LG product."
5,Love IT!,"I just got this phone in the mail today. In less than 5 minutes from opening the box I had the phone activated and called a friend. If you know how to use and activate phones it's very easy to start using the phone. I Love the menus, options etc. Overall, I can see I'm going to love it way more than the phone I upgraded from, which was two years old, and I loved that phone too!"
1,Didn't work,"Every time we powered it on, it said ""please use legitimate battery"" and then would immediately shut down. Even after spending more money for another battery, it still said the same thing. Oh well"
1,Bad experience,"I ordered 2 phones,and as soon as they arrived they were in horrible conditions,seller promptly sent another 2 phones when I returned the first two,and when these phone got here they were worst then the first 2! No chargers,no batteries,ESN number written in pen inside the phone. Very disappointing!!! I want my money back! Waiting on their response in the matter!"
4,Good Phone Even with All the Extras,"When my previous phone broke I just wanted a phone that made calls. However, these days it's difficult to get a simple cell phone. I was originally afraid of getting a phone with so many features because the phone software becomes so complicated that the basic phone functions become problematic. A previous phone crashed more often than my computer operating system. Fortunately, this phone has lasted six months without any trouble."
3,"Phone is great, except for Camera","I have no issues with the phone's performance, except for the quality of the camera's pictures. They are horrible. You have to be in the perfect light, the subject has to be completely still, and you might get a half-way decent picture. But most of the pics I have taken have been horrible and I didn't save 80% of them, they were just too blurry."
4,Good Phone,"This phone works well and was in great condition. Seller shipped quickly and all that was advertised was included. It's a simple, sturdy, phone that is easy to use and charges quickly. It is holding up well so far and I am very happy with it."
1,poor,The physical appearance of the phone is great but it won’t hold a charge and the ear piece doesn’t work. If I need to talk on the phone I have to put it on speaker to hear whats being said on the other line.
2,POOR CALL RECEPTION COM{ARED TO MY OLD MOTO E 815,"We have had 4 of these LG 8300 phones since June. The call reception quality has been POOR as compared to my older Motorola E815. I never had a problem using my E815 anywhere in my house, going to town etc. But thesxe LG8300 phones constantly cut out, drop calls in the same locations. We've taken them back to Verizon for the V04 software upgrades which are supposed to help with reception but doesn't as far as I'm concerned. I WANT A PHONE FOR A PHONE, THE BEST PHONE, I have a digital camera, if I want a MP3 player I'll buy one. AGAIN I want a PHONE for a PHONE and want it to be the best, if that is what you want DON'T BUY LG especilally the LG8300. Now we're stuck for 2 years with inferior reception with these LG8300 phones. I would have gotten more Motorola E815 phones but Verizon no longer sells them, pitty, it was the best phone for a phone I ever had."
2,Has the extras - but sounds terrible.,"Hmpfh ergg tyhhu jjas. At least, that what this review would sound like if you were listening to it on the VX8300. Me and my wife each bought the phone with Verizon's ""New after 2"" plan, and chose this one. It does have a good (not great) camera, the MP3 player plays MP3s, and the micro SD card is nice. My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it. We went back to the store, thinking it was defective. After trying 5 others, we realized it was not just hers. Mine was actually the exception - and even then, the sound was not great, more like ""barely intelligible"". We were upgrading from a Motorola V276, which sounded WAYYY better, no contest, just didn't have the bells and whistles. I regret getting this phone, and advise people who actually have to listen to phone calls, not play MP3s or text messages, to avoid it. There are way too many others that sound much better."
1,It won't work,You will see an error message that genuine batter is required. I checked solutions suggested in websites but nothing worked. It was a waste. I won't buy a cheap Korean phone again. It sucks!
4,Great Phone,"I have had this phone for a few days now and I love it. The only bad thing about this phone right now is the fact that there is a very limited choice of accessories. But this is not to big of a deal, I will just have to wait till LG and Verizon come out with the stuff I want for this thing."
2,disappointed,"phone arrived timely but battery will not charge and/or charger device is not connecting well to charge phone. Bought this for elderly parent, who has to switch back to old, damaged phone within one week. product quality not good."
1,Phone Charger Needed,"You sold me a phone without a charger, I looked in every store possible for a charger and wasn't able to find one. You should have said in the ad there wasn't a charger"
2,Too small,Nice little phone but keys are too small which would make it hard to use. Not much different than my old gusto phone.
4,LG Cell phone,I had one like it that gave several years good service; this one fits well for my cell phone needs.
3,The manual stinks,"I just got the phone today and it's taking me forever to set it up. The manual doesn't give the correct directions. It doesn't have a quick reference to use voice dialing. I had to look it up on-line. I put the cd in and it doesn't give me the option to ask me if I want to start, pause, or exit so I had to reboot my computer(at work).I know I should wait till I get through the set up before I complain but I hope this isn't a sign of how absurd it's going to be to set up Vcast, bluetooth and actually use the phone."
5,LG VX8300,"Very reliable with excellent sound quality. The perfect phone if you're not into the ""smart phone"" category. I purchased this one to replace my original VX8300 that lasted 5-years until one too many drops to the pavement resulted in intermittent display operation."
4,lg vx 8300,Very pleased with quality of product. Just needed a phone to make and receive calls to replace the one I lost without what I consider the extra bells and whistles. Though this phone has internet capability I have not accessed it because I don't have the need for it. Phone arrived in brand new condition with plastic protection on the covers and even though it is refurbished it appears spotless. Good choice.
2,"Bad Battery, Good Phone","The phone came in great condition, it looks brand new even though it's refurbished. The only problem is the battery that came with it will only work while the phone is plugged into the charger. I wonder if this company will replace it since it's refurbished? Great phone, bad battery. Luckily I have an extra one since I have owned this phone before. Hopefully it lasts since I had that phone for 5 years. If they fixed this problem I would give it 5 stars"
3,LG VX8300 cell phone,"Items were purchased for my sister and brother in-law and they arrived earlier than expected. However, one of the phones was defective and after taking the phone to a verizon store it was learned that the battery may be defective. I am in process of purchasing cases, as well as, a battery for these phones. My sister and brother-in law liked the phones despite minor problems. Would order again from this seller. Thanks Amazon!!!"
1,Not Good,"Owned a ""refurbished"" one for literally 3 months and something happened to the phone (""Car Kit"") and I no longer have audio. I have read many reviews at this point and spoke with verizon employees, this is a pretty typical thing. I attempted all troubleshooting and nothing got it out of this mode. Otherwise the buttons were too small and the phone is very outdated. You get what you pay for. I got mine to the door for $35. (0.38/day) Could be worse."
3,BAD BATTERY LIFE,ITS A NICE PHONE EASY TO USE BUT VERY BAD BATTERY LIFE YOU HAVE TO CHARGE IT EVERY NIGHT!!
4,Better than expected,"I was fairly pleased with the phone I recieved, there were a few scratches but it works great! Absolutely love it!"
4,Great value for phone,"I received everything in working condition. The power adapter, which did not work was easily remedied by using one from my friend. The seller did offer to credit me for the faulty adapter, however!I would buy from this company/person again."
5,Almost as good when I saw it in 1942!,"Holy Mackeral! Saw this fim at the Lincoln Theatre in Charleston, South Carolina in 1942 and enjoyed it and then enjoyed it again 70 years later as it was almost like the original I saw upon the silver screen, what a delight! Spencer Williams produced and directed this great film and acted in it as well and was outstanding, as expected! Sarge Booker of Palm Coast, Florida"
1,The Girl in Room 20/Son of Ingagi/The Girl From...,All I have to say its before my time oooook. any one want to buy it thanks. hated it not me sorry
3,"not bad, but...","I haven't heard the album, but I heard this band live yesterday. In my opinion, just ordinary Norwegian blackmetallers, nothing unique. Better buy the new Dimmu Borgir album, they really rocked my a$$ away..."
3,Don't Listen to the Sasquatch,"This is a sturdy fine-toothed comb. The comb is very durable, but it's not too flexible. For example, I usually carry a comb in my back pocket and on a recent train trip, I didn't put the comb in my pocket correctly and it broke when I sat down. It's also kind of expensive. However, my pet Sasquatch says, ""This comb pulled all the bugs and leaves out of my hair. I'll use it every time before I go out on the town."" I guess it worked for him, but he doesn't comb his hair very often so I don't think he's the best one to take a recommendation from."
3,Not a great horror film.,"This one bored more than thrilled. This movie was nothing special. The acting, settings and premise were all weak, but the gore was very nice. If you have $20 bucks and 2 hours to kill, go for it; otherwise dont bother."
4,Bel Canto fan,"This recording has obviously been transferred from a VCR tape, but at the price, nothing else could be expected. I think it is a tremendous bargain. And there is no alternative. I have no intention of being ultra critical as over-all I thoroughly enjoyed the production. On the whole, the sound and picture are fine. The cast is first class, though some act better than others. It is an opera I will watch many more times."
3,Great Horne and Ramey. Nice Anderson,"Beautiful production most likely put together for Marilyn Horne.After all they through Joan Sutherland under a bus let's do something for Horne!Horne slightly beyond her peek but still riveting as the centerpiece of this production.Anderson sings nicely but a bit colorless. She's a beautiful woman still there's nothing in her performance that suggests she's capable of murder. The duets are somewhat anti climatic.Samual Ramey is golden age. All in all not to be missed for Ramey, Horne and the great Rossini."
5,Stunning,"This has become my favorite opera, mainly because of this performance. Every character is superbly played. The music is a beautiful as can be imagined. Sanford Olson has one of the greatest tenor voices I have ever heard and his role is magnificent."
2,Good but no cigar!,"June Anderson is certainly no Joan Sutherland. While well paced and good recording techniques, performers are less than stellar. Marilyn Horne is still excellent after some twenty plus years in the role, other performers leave a great deal to be desired (I expected more from the Met and was disappointed). The 1965/6 Sutherland/Horne recording is still the gold standard only because of the two of then. The sumptiously voiced D'Archangel on the 1990 Prague recording is still the best Oreo as well as Kundy's Idreno although poor mic placement is a constant distraction. There is still room for a ""best possible"" cast if one is ever to be created."
2,Absurd trouser role for Horne,I am beginning to think that opera should be heard and not seen. It is bad enough that trouser roles still exist in the 21st century but to cast a 56 year old stubby fat woman played by Horne as the young male lover is painful to watch. I do not care how beautiful her voice is...and to make matters worse she is the long lost son of her love interest...come on she is old enough to be the mother of her love interest. The MET did the same with Price in Verdi's Forces of Destiny. It is extremely annoying. I see no reason why these young male roles cannot be sung by young attractive tenors. Only in opera is everyone oblivious to the absurd in miscasting it seems. Along this line I refuse to watch a 60 year old Sutherland as a daughter of the regiment.
2,Gimme a break.....,"My first shock was when I found there was no English.... if the review said anything about that, I'd'a chosen something else. But that's not the worst of it -- I can't (so far) find the libretto for the darn thing. But that's still not the worst of it. I went directly to Bel raggio -- and guess what? Jane Anderson's singing is still bloody awful. I had thought, well, MAYBE she used to be somebody. Nope. She never way. Bel canto? You've GOT to be kidding. Okay, so I listened to the familiar overture, then found no English, then zipped to No. 19 to see if Anderson was better than I remembered.Hah!And THAT was after listening with great satisfaction to Bryn and Cecilia from Glyndboune. So Bartoli is a (light) mezzo (coloratura) and not a lyric (coloratura), but the difference in timbre, to say nothing of everything else was astounding to painful.I hope I can return the dratted recording."
3,More Defense than Method,"I've looked at over a dozen books to try and find a good, solid guide for my students to they can have a foot up on thinking historically. Gaddis book is more philosophy and comparisons with social and natural science than it is a book describing historical theory and method. Perhaps I run in my accepting circles but I've never had to defend my historical work or my department against attacks from social or natural scientists; we realize that every discipline has it's own way of gathering, analyzing and using information. By and large this book seemed like a apologia than a guide for historians. While it was a interesting read for me, I firmly believe it would confuse most undergraduates making the audience for this book much more narrow than I had hoped."
4,Sisterwife,"Ms. Collins writes a great story full of twists and turns and stories within stories. You won't soon forget the characters who inhabit Sisterwife! A book for these terrorizing times, readers will get lost in this saga of cult religions and how the zealous mind works in seeking their goals, even to the extent of murder! The plot of Sisterwife will absorb your attention, as you race through this page-turner to learn the fate of the many players swirling in and around the cult activities. Sisterwife is a smorgasboard that crosses over the genres of romance, realism, psychology, religion, drama, action, and fiction that reads like non-fiction. Sisterwife leaves you wanting more, and for days after you finish the last page, you will write scenarios and sequels in your head as the characters remain with you. WARNING: Be prepared to spend hours engrossed in Sisterwife and clear some time on your calendar!"
1,Very disappointed,"I ordered this for me niece's 16th Birthday. It came in a small box in a ""bubble"" envelope. The stone is loose, there was no tag on the ring and it cannot be exchanged as Peora has no more. Think twice before buying from this company.Sincerely,ari"
5,Breath of a Wok,"I consider myself somewhat of a gourmet (at least that's what my friends tell me) and I own a fair number of books on cooking, food and traveling. I cannot say enough about the Breath of the Wok which touches on all three subjects.The stories of different regions, different dishes, and different methods all explained with the wok as the centerpiece, is nothing less than masterful. And if that isn't enough the photography is breathtaking.After reading the book and trying many of the dishes, I truly feel like I have visited China and have a fair understanding of the culture as it relates to their cuisine. I now cook with my new wok on a weekly basis and I appreciate what I am doing and how I am doing it (the Zen if you will) in context of the country it all began in. We even use chopsticks!This book is so much more than a cookbook - you must really see it to appreciate it. Do NOT loan it out to friends. We have had to ask twice to get it back!"
4,Not as detailed as I had hoped,"Although this is a very nice book and it has some well written stories, I was anticipating something with a lot more detail (historical, more pictures, etc.). It was still an enjoyable read."
5,A wonderful book,"This is not your usual cooking book. In fact, I'm reading it and loving it for other reasons. The author goes into great detail about the subject of the book: the wok. She manages to fill the pages with such interesting and well presented information, that it's hard to put the book down. She'd done an incredible amount of research for this book. She visited countless cooking establishments and spoke with a large number of respected chefs. I love that she gives credit where credit is due.One can tell that writing this book was a labor of love. I thank the author for this unusual and outstanding book."
5,Grace Young writes as if speaking with you.,"I loved her first book, although the binding did not hold up for long. The content is still good. Breath of a Wok is fabulous. The writing is clear and friendly, the recipes are clear and friendly. The photographs are lovely, the beautifully prepared food in pretty dishes, as well as the funky cooking shots and interesting family pictures. She inspires me to keep learning to cook Chinese. It will make you want to go shopping in Chinatown!"
4,Read This Before Purchasing Your Wok,"Not really a cookbook but a cultural study of woks. The seasoning, care and maintenance of the wok are described here are very useful.My chief complaint is that the one photo picturing a very well cared-for wok is in black and white. This is irritating because you can't really see what it looks like (it's a patch of black).Some reviewers seem not to have finished reading the book. The reason for and the use of chives were clearly explained."
5,Epic.,"Apart from the little rattle I get from both levers, these levers are amazing. To fix the rattle, just pop the plastic things inside the lever itself with a small hex wrench. Vioala, no rattle levers :)"
4,Copper Crown,"While the story is well told and the language is beautiful, the lack of tension is a little disappointing. The reading brought to mind Like Water for Chocolate and especially the inside story in Fried Green Tomatoes. But there isn't much that the reader can't see coming. Stories of racial hatred and the unfairness perpetrated on some are always difficult reads, but there is a hopefulness in this book. If you have an avoidance to ghosts this might not be the book for you. Generally the characters and language make in a worthwhile read."
1,fraud,Thought I was purchasing the ACE hard rubber combs. These are simply plastic and break easily. The product description should have mentioned that these were plastic. Shame on the Ace company
1,"Yep, what you read is true. These are a poor substitute.","These new versions of the Ace Classic comb are not manufactured like they used to be. The new ones do a poor job combing the hair and are very uncomfortable to the scalp. Don't ask me how or why this is, but you won't want these. It's sad."
2,Dont buy if you want to carry in pocket,"A mens black plastic comb...how can you mess that up? Well, if you make it out of brittle plastic thats how. I bought six of these thinking I would not need to worry about getting another comb for a very long time but I was wrong. The plastic is brittle and just by keeping them in my back hip pocket of my pants, (even dress pants) I find broken teeth all over the place all the time. If you leave this on the counter its fine, but if you want to carry it in your back pocket pick a more durable comb."
2,Pocket Comb....,"It looked like the comb I was looking for......but, unfortunately it was not. The teeth broke out at various times, while combing my hair. I was looking for a more reliable comb."
1,Not As Advertised,"The photo shows a comb with both narrow and wide teeth. However, the combs sent to me by Amazon had all narrow teeth. Why doesn't Amazon use a pictute the correctly describes the product?"
2,6 combs,Combs by ACE are the best. However these are too small for a man's hair. Next time I will order a larger size. These would probably be great for children with small hands.
4,Suitable For Purchasing,"There are some good songs here, like the upbeat anthem ""Celebrate"", the sentimental ballad from the musical 'Hair' ""Easy To Be Hard"", covers by Laura Nyro and Elton John ""Eli's Coming"", ""Lady Samantha"". Three Dog Night also contributes with a couple of their own compositions as well, with the drum instrumental ""King Solomon's Mines"", and Danny Hutton's ""Dreaming Isn't Good For You"". This album put TDN on the map. Too bad ""Suitable For Framing"" isn't available domestically. Better purchase this version before it, too goes out of print."
1,A complete waste of money!,"If you want to learn Dreamweaver do not buy this book. This is the required book for a college class I am taking on Dreamweaver- it is an awful book. No explanations, just lots of click here, do this, do that. They don't tell you why you are doing what you are doing. The instructions are unclear- I often cannot find what button or command they are referring to. Everyone in the class is having these problems. The instructor is having to walk us through all of the exercises that we should be able to do on our own with the book. I have learned nothing from this book."
3,midnight Moon Aroma Burns through the oils fast,"This Item is cute however it burns through the oils way too fast. I think some instructions inside would have been helpful too go along with the gift. As a gift sent, it is confusing for the person too know how to use it correctly ."
1,It's cheap for a reason,"The gloss finnish burns right off the bowl when you use it. It looks cool before you use it, but then again it is cheap."
2,This ISN'T the book I'd take,"I'm not sure what the purpose of this book is unless you're at the very preliminary stages of planning your trip. Very few towns get more than a couple of sentences, the accommodations and dining section is so small that it seems merely token, and I can't say that I agree with their ratings on several items.Meanwhile, if you really have no clue where you want to go, you could use the pictures here as a starter. Then you'd still need to go elsewhere to get more in-depth, practical information. SO... the reason this book even gets two stars is because it DOES have a lot of pictures."
5,Very effective sleep aid!,"As a Type A personality, I have a difficult time falling asleep at night, since I'm always thinking about what things need to get done. A friend of mine suggested I play some soft sounds at night to lull me to sleep.I found this set of nature sound CDs that includes white noise. I don't know anything about white noise, but I thought if it could help me sleep, I'd give it a try, half-laughing to myself that I'd pay for sounds I could get for free if I just went outside or down to the beach!I'm amazed, this stuff works! It is especially effective when I listen to the CD through headphones or earbuds, it drowns out all my thoughts so I can just relax and decompress. I particularly love the low tones of the ""Wind"" CD, and the ""Waves"" CD makes me feel like I'm literally at the beach, which really calms me down.I still don't know much about white noise, but I know these CDs have helped me get a better night's sleep."
1,Poor Quality Router,"I'm relatively experienced with installing and using wireless router technology. My roommate bought this router when we first moved into our current place. It arrived, and I installed it, making sure to update the firmware immediately after setting it up. This router has been nothing but trouble from day one, constantly cutting off Internet connections, and needing to be refreshed at least three or four times a week. My computer is set up less than thirty feet away from it, yet I cannot maintain a constant connection to the Internet for more than twenty or so minutes. I cannot recommend staying away from this more."
5,Zoom Zoom,"Great price....easy to setup. Great range/throughput (though that's the N spec...and not specific, so much, to TrendNet)Works as advertised and as excpted. Tools are easy to use and support (site and phone) are excellent."
1,The setup of this wireless router is very very complicated,"When I setup this router, it always has many problems. It took me a lot of hours to set it up.When use it, sometimes the wireless signal drop down."
1,"Decent for home, NO NO for work","If you need to download big files, this thing is a piece of crap. The proximity is low, it's good for about 12 feet, but if you're needing connectivity 20+ feet, this thing is HORRIBLE. Avoid."
1,0/5 stars - useless product,"I have set up wireless networks before, and thought this trendnet router was a bargain for what it promised. however, i have never had so much trouble setting up a network. Eventually I only got it working on one of my laptops, and their customer support tried for an hour to help me out, to no avail. I have returned it and have ordered the more expensive d-link extreme. I really do not recommend anyone purchasing this product."
3,Review of TEW-631brp,Its a good product but overpriced...The advertisement of increased range is a fantasy. Its easy to set up and fine but its no better tha another brand which is about $30 less
2,Very Poor Customer Service - N configuration is not worked out...,"If you are buying this router for the N connection speed beware! This is a draft version and the N speed is not compatible with some wireless cards that are supposed to provide N connection. Their customer service is backed up and of really bad quality (everytime you call they ask to take your information and call you back, but they never do). I don't recommend this router."
5,Excellent router!!! Best router I've used for home and small business networks!!!,"I've had two Trendnet TEW-631BRP for over a year for home and a small business network. In that entire time I've lost wireless conductivity once for a total of 5 seconds. It's range, speed and reliability is much better than the g routers I've had in the past. I found this router extremely easy to set up, and it has great security features.Some of the negative reviews of this router are just plain dumb. This router was built for home and small office use--wireless connections with multiple devices in small and medium size homes and small offices. If you want to use it in a very big building with many walls you will need a access point (signal booster).Although I hear that Trendnet technical support quality varies from technician to technician, the two times I've used tech support I found the technicians very helpful and polite. There are great prices for this router available. I highly recommend the TEW-631BRP!!"
2,Bad service,"A good router but not worth the frustration their technical support folks will cause you if you need help. This has got to be one of the worst tech experiences of my life and I've been in computers since before Bill Gates left school. Rude, uncaring, illiterate and unattentive about sums it up. It took 4 calls before my problem was corrected and we still don't know what caused it. That I accept. Their attitude I can't.Although the reviews on this item were good, I personally will steer clear of all Trendnet items from now on."
1,Not watchable,This is a shame that this is another movie that can not be watched in Australia when I orded it from the Australian web site. This is one of my top 10 westerns and normally I would give it 4or 5 star rating depending on the quality of the image and sound.To Amazons credit they are refunding me.I am looking forward to watching this one and changing my review.
4,Broken Arrow,"Broken Arrow was a wonderful film that served as the model for many westerns to follow. In this story, the Native Americans are three dimensional beings with families and worries and a culture to rival the one that will overtake it. The poignant, tragic love story emphasized how difficult it is for cultures to come together, but it also emphasized that it can be done."
3,Broken Arrow,"What we have here is a revisionist effort toward the American Indian, nothing wrong with that. It's just stories & movies that have a moral to tell often don't come off. Stewart is good as is Jeff Chandler as Cochise, an honorable Indian, willing to make an effort at peace. Is it real compared to history? I really don't know. This movie was made to be a statement about the American Indian; he was an honorable man & he was pushed by the whites into fighting for their ancestral lands or to retain what little they had left. This movie portrays that scenario well but it doesn't make it a great one."
5,Broken Arrow DVD Western,"The product purchased as a gift and at a good price. This is a good quality, good value product. Service was good as well. All round winner for me"
3,Nothing Like It,"My personal review of this monster would have five stars, but I recognize that not everyone shares my love for horrible noise. Just trust me--love it or hate it (I can't imagine much middle ground except total bewilderment), you've never heard anything like this. Soundtrack music for very, very bad experiences, remembered through a psychotic or pharmaceutical haze."
3,"No match for kurosawa, but quiet a good one","Well-structured, a rather interesting storyline and well-choreographed battlescenes: these are the main strengths of this epic. On the other hand, you have some little-enthusiastic actors, playing their boring part in a sometimes even more boring way, except the great Toshiro Mifune, of course. However, he sometimes seems a little lost, as if being at the wrong place, waisting his energy while trying to bring on his one-man-show. All this makes the movie lack a certain deepness of the caracters, destroying any approach to a real, memorial warlord-saga. The comparison with Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"" seems to be a little unfair, but you gotta pay some respects to Mifune's and Inagaki's efforts, however. Perhaps a ""must see"" for every Samuraifan, but none for anyone else."
2,samurai banners,"This is the first time I have purchased a japanese Samurai movie other than those by Kurosawa, and I was disappointed. I made the decision to buy based on one of these reviews which said it was on a par with the Kurosawa's.To me the only redeeming factor is Mifune who I find fascinating - but the film was a poor immitation of any of those by Kurosawa. I felt it was slow, contrived and not at all grippng.Had I not seen the others then maybe it would have been more watchable, but it was almost as if the director was copying Kurosawa style but frankly he was not good at it."
1,Beware,"I first ordered this DVD through Border's. When I received it and played it, there were NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. This, despite the fact that the menu listed subtitles. So I then ordered it from Amazon. When I received it, it was the same story, NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES, despite the menu listing such.Fool that I am, I had given away my VHS version before I had received either DVD!Perhaps Amereigo, the production company, issued a few duds, I don't know. Anyway, when you receive your DVD, keep the packaging, as you may need to return it."
1,The DVD sucks,I received a DVD by Animeigo that gets to be almost pitch black and then goes back to normal every 5 seconds. Obviously I received a dud from Animeigo. I'll never buy anything from that distributor again.
2,"Too Many Obscure Songs - Buy ""25 Beach Music Classics""","""Beach Music Sounds"" was disappointing. While the CD does have some good selections, MANY of the selections were unknown to me (and I'm in the music business). Further, some of the arrangements (see Tams medley) are far from the best. The fidelity is not that great either. The best Beach Music CD to buy is ""25 Beach Music Classics."""
5,Credo Corn Cutter Really Does the Job,"I purchased this for hard to control calloused skin on the heels of my feet. man I finally found the right product. It works so good you have to be carefull not to slice away to much good skin.For follow up maintenace treatments you can use the detachable rasp file.Specific product that gets the specific job done,"
3,Great brand of mints,This isn't my favorite flavor. The rose is definitely the best. These taste a bit soapy but still good. If you like violet mints a lot then you will probably also like these.
3,"Nice phone, serious problem...","This phone has a lot of great features and it's really nice, it takes some time to get used to the menu... the main problem i found is that it has some kind of leathery paint that peels off when i carry it in my pocket, so i don't recommend carrying it in your jeans pocket on days off... now it looks really bad..."
2,don't like to complain but....,"My daughter's boyfriend gave me this telescope. Never owned a telescope, got it free, shouldn't complain...but this thing is not fun. The crude adjustments to the finderscope and main scope are very poor quality. And, as other reviewers have noted about other telescopes, the huge magnification makes no sense. I just hope this telescope will wet my appetite for something much better."
1,Immobilist Ideology,"A recent edition of ""British Archaeology"" noted that the ideological prejudice against the idea of population movements among British archaeologists had gotten to the point where some postgraduate student would soon come up with a paper 'proving' that the first humans in Britain weren't immigrants at all, but purely indigenous, symbolically transformed reindeer.Renfew is already well along that road; in this volume he tortures (and/or massively ignores) two centuries of linguistic research in an attempt to argue that as soon as no literate observers are present the basic mechanisms of historical change are completely different.This fairy-tale of peaceful farmers who, once there, never move, and of languages which remain perfectly static for 3000 years, is a stain on the reputation of a notable scholar.He should reconcile himself to the notion that people have feet -- and note that you can walk from Denmark to Greece in a summer."
4,"A fun read, nevertheless","Yes, the Anatolian origin for Indo-European is questionable at best, and most scholars don't believe it; neither is it supported by any independent data based on physiology, such as blood grouping studies, that I know of. Unfortunately, it is necessary for Professor Renfrew's time line that the point of origin be west of the areas usually recognized.However, there is something compelling about his picture of the spread of language through expansion more than through migration and invasion. The idea of large numbers of fairly primitive tribes leapfrogging hither and thither almost at random through Europe displacing, defeating, and/or giving language lessons to any indigenous populations they encounter is neither attractive nor elegant.In either case, this book is engagingly written and can be understood and enjoyed by anyone with an interest in the subject. Even if the theory is not valid, there is much food for thought here; reading it is time well spent."
2,A good read,"A good story and Renfrew challenges many holy cows along the way. But it is weak on the Indian side of the evidence. Renfrew says that the Vedic people did not know Shiva, but that is wrong since Shiva and Rudra are the same and Rudra has many important hymns in the Vedas."
1,"Wow, junk.","First off I'm over forty and do know how to fly kites.We got this kite for our kids it does look very colorful and pretty as my daughter says. To bad it doesn't fly. The wind rating for this kite is 5-10MPHThat doesn't matter because it goes up and hooks to the left and kisses the ground.Its says that it is rip proof nylon, that doesn't matter either when it crashes to earth.Look you what a better kite, keep the plastic bag you get from the supermarket and put a string on it. Bingo better kite."
3,The Puppet Show,I like this book because it is quite special to me.it is about a girl who is very shy and only speaks through her puppets.
3,not so impressed,"with my purchase of the tea I was not impressed very much , as I did try other teas of yerba mate and this one doesn't have any different taste as the others even it's says organic , i think for the 1/2 lb the price is little expensive , I bought 1 lb for a half price ."
4,Good for moderate-advanced botanist....,"Was recommended to me be an extension horticulturalist, teacher. First half of of book is dichotomous keys, the second half drawings. Can be used in NE area, not just Maine. If you don't know much about dichotomous keys, this book isn't for you. However, it is useful for more advance study, learning trees by buds, bark, etc. The pictures really focus on bud placement and size, look. There is no definition section for the keys, so you will need another book or previous knowledge for that."
3,sort of interesting.,"This cube is okay. Occasionally my son will play with it, but mostly he just likes to throw it. It might be a good toy to hang from a car seat handle. As a gift, it's okay but I wouldn't spend my own money on it. Not worth it."
5,Must have for Infants/Babies,"I had one of these for my daughter that is now 7 years old. I purchased another one for my son and it is the ""go to"" toy for home and being out and about."
4,Lots to explore,I have a 7 month old and he's just starting to sit up. He enjoys holding and playing with this toy. I also plan to attach it to our stroller once we go for walks bc I think it will keep him entertained.I read the reviews on it before buying and all seemed positive.
3,Great toy,"When my baby was 4months old, she LOVED this toy. The crinkly arms, the cushiness of the cube, and THE RINGS. Oh, she LOVED the orange and blue rings. This toy entertained her everyday for a good couple of months. At 7 months old, I think she might have grown bored of it? I still think its a great toy, but I think some of the other Lamaze toys provide more variety of textures, colors rattles, and other discoveries."
4,Primo Early Smog...meet Strawberry Rash,"Bill Callahan is a genius. You will not like Julius Caesar at first. I promise. Why? Well, at first it just seems annoying. You feel like asking yourself what the hell this guy was thinking when he made this. You had better have some tolerance for lo-fi. From all that I've heard, Callahan recorded this album at home on a four-track, and it sounds like it. But once you get used to that (unless you love lo-fi, like me) you find some songs that are just wonderful. Callahan is one of the unspoken poets of our generation."
4,New world meets old problems,"Like the subtitle indicates - this novel carries grand ambitions of bringing you into a wast and incredible setting, with driven characters and fantastic sets making up the back drop.A few memorable bit pieces, some over the top political swipes - and a well put togheter setting for musing on the trancendence of time, space and life. The book is well enough written to just skim like an airport novel, but still has some of the touchstones of great SF: current concepts taken to their logical extreme, wast new worlds only hinted at in their complexity, and concepts that can keep you up at night pondering their implications - and how you would react, should they come to pass."
1,Dissapointed,"I fell for the ""space opera"" label. This book is dated (who is going to get the David Koresh references?) and I was surprised to see it was published as recently as 04. Good science fiction shouldn't go stale so quickly, but it is hopelessly stuck in the 90s. This would be forgivable if the characters were less cartoonish. I kept wondering why I should care about any of them and does Groundskeeper Willy have a better accent? There is some fun world building, but the people inhabiting it are just plain silly."
3,Decent book,It's ok...but it meanders a bit....and when it ends you find you aren't all that concerned...but it has some very cool ideas in it....so I enjoyed parts.
4,Good read,"Good solid Sci-fi, strong tech and good philosophical inquiry into what it means to be human if everything about us can be reconstructed or even recreated from ground up. My only critique is the writing style can get confusing at times and ...I did get lost now and then. I think it's his way of trying to spell things like the characters are saying them at all times. Normally I can adapt to this quickly but the problems start to hit when there are 3 or more characters all talking at the same time in different dialects back and forth. It just gets all too much and actually served to pull me out of the story and ""break the spell"" instead of drawing me in. Aside from having to remove a star for that it was still a really awesome book. Not a top 10 author but definitely a top 25 in the sci-fi genre."
3,better than bad,"These knives are ok, definitely a good deal for the price. Mine arrived sharp, but after three months of use I've had to sharpen them. They look nice and have been an inexpensive replacement for the cheap-o knives I had been using."
1,A picture is worth a 1000 words? I think not!,Pinzon 8-Piece Chef Knife Block SetI bought this on sale for approx $15. I got what I paid for. This is the worst knife set I have ever owned. The only redeeming part of this set is the scissors. Don't waste your money as they won't hold an edge at all.
5,An excellent knife block set for the price.,"It could be true that it can't be compared to other high-priced knife block set in terms of quality. However, how excellent quality are you expecting for this low, low price set?Let me be fair, it is excellent for my daily use, it is excellent for my money and it is excellent if you don't wanna pay extra, extra for a daily-use knife set.Last, I could this: it worth more than a set of a brand name if you don't wanna to pay or can't afford.I wanna recommend those buyers who love to complain about its quality but are not willing to pay extra: be real."
2,Welcome to Harbor Freight 9-C* Products,"Have you been to Harbor Freight and smelled the stinky Chinese rubber tires. This Hurst boot smells the same. It's from the the Hurst 9-C* Boot Company. I blame the bloated bureaucraty of American Government for driving what used to be made in America to foreign countries.The EPA now stands for Ending Productivilty in America and the Employment Prevention Act and Enforcing Preident's Agenda. Under President Obysmal, the EPA has expanded beyond need to greed.*9-C = Cheap Chinese Communist Conscritped Child Cruelty Conflicting Capitalism Crap."
2,fitment & Amazon service is very poor,The Amazon site says this fits an escalate - but only the front pcs do - the rear window pcs are too short and Amazon will just ship another of the same kit without reading the reason for a return/replacement.Buy 2 separate kits. 1 front & 1 rear - then at least you have a chance of getting a full set that fits properly.Front fits perfectly.Try WeatherTech - more money - but at least their stuff fits and they have real humans reading email.
4,Good value for money,"This is a good set that meets our needs. The lazy susan is a nice feature, and the stand is a good safety feature. Little bulky to store, but is perfect for a family of 4."
3,It arrived broken,"The item was sent to our daughter in Texas and when she took it out of the box at Christmas time, it was cracked. They did send it back and it is my understanding they were to be credited for it - I'm not sure if that meant as an Amazon credit or some other way."
2,great product but broken upon receipt.,great product but the stoneware was cracked when I received the item. it was a gift so it wasn't opened until it was too late to send the product back. thankfully my sister didn't mind the broken dish and just glued it back together. a safer method of shipping would've been preferred.
4,More of a Back Relaxer than an Eye Strengthener,"The idea behind this 25-minute yoga workout is to increase oxygen flow/circulation to your eyes, and also to relax them, in order to improve eyesight. While I really can't say whether or not my eyesight will improve to any real extent, I like the workout for another reason. The main part of the workout is a shoulderstand/plough sequence that feels very good on the back. You begin with a short breathing sequence (alternate-nostril breathing), move into a couple of sun salutations to warm up, and then come the shoulderstands and ploughs. By the time you're through, your back feels all stretched out and relaxed. I'll keep doing this workout for that benefit alone, and if my eyesight improves along the way, I'll just consider that icing on the cake."
1,Stale Pie,"Although this is a good deal for 3 DVDs, the three DVDs you get are nothing but garbage. The original trilogy incorporated humor and sex, but it also included good lessons(kind of) about high-school and post-high-school relationships. In these movies, no lessons are learned by anyone. If i wanted to see a bunch of naked girls with no plot line, there are millions of websites to see that, so these movies are crap. After Erik and Tracy supposedly fall in love at the end of the naked mile, she runs away with Trent in beta house. It just doesn't make any sense. Erik's ejaculation problems are the poor man's version of Jim's in the original series. Though these pies are baked by the same company as the originals, they are stale and don't even deserve to be violated by Jim."
5,Well It's Pretty Good But The Cast Isn't All That Great,"I watched Band Camp and I thought it was funny,crude and everything you would expect. Naked Mile was a 4****(4 star) movie but not 5. Beta House was a 5*****(5 star) but almost every ten minutes there was nudity. So don't watch Beta House if you're easily shocked by nudity"
1,Barska Gladiator-disappointed,"This is the second Barska scope I purchased, the first from Amazon. The service and later refund from Amazon was flawless. The tripod for the scope was broke right out of the package, it was very cheaply made with a mounting system that doesn't match the quality of the scope. The first Barska I purchased from another sight had the same problem (it is definately a design problem). The scope itself was nice with the quality and clarity you would expect in a scope in this price range, but count on the tripod being broke or breaking later with an expensive scope mounted on it."
1,Better off with a real book,"This is a really bad buy, I would not advise any one to get this CD. It has some serious flaws in its use of the Internet Explorer web browser and claims that Microsoft would have fixed it in the IE 5 version. This is very mis-leading mainly because they don't tell you this until you read the fine print that comes with the CD. They even encourage you to use Netscape which does not have any problems when using this CD. I think that they, as the author of this CD owe a responsiblity to the consumer to make this fact known before purchase and not to bundle such information with its installation instrcutions. Further more I think they should have corrected the problem themselves instead of shifting the blame to others."
5,3d studio viz3 and max3 training cd,"having used autocad for a number of years i decided to look at the visualisation side of architecture and purchased a copy of viz3. but being new to this side of cad i need something to give me an instant start at producing visuals so after much searching for the right help, i happened upon the above title from opencad who are leaders in this sort of tutorial. i found the instant access and methodology of the cd both easy to use and intuitive and as a result i have managed to produce a few visuals albeit crude ones given that i have only had the disk for a few days (3). i will definately be looking at the 3d max tutorials and would have no hesitation in purchasing further titles from opencad in the future."
5,Cartoon DVD,I still enjoy cartoons as an adult and being able to see the cartoons I grew up with is great. My children also enjoy watching it over and over again. My children can't wait for me to purchase the next volume.
3,Introducing a grandchild to something old.,"After seeing the new version of Underdog, my grandson wanted more. So, I ordered him the cartoon version that his parents grew up with and he was delighted. He watches it all the time."
3,cool game derailed by too many mindless fights,"This a ""story brawler"". Kind of like Shadow of Rome or Shenmue. Interesting cut scenes and a solid plot with various fight sequences to give you interactive action. There's numerous mini-missions to explore and you can actually score with some different ""hostess"" girls. My main problem with it is that you get drawn into another street fight every time you walk a block or two. Winning fights gives you experience and builds up your power. But you have to do it so frequently it becomes a nuisance and chore. Now, there are numerous scenes in which you NEED to fight to get on with the story - and those are fine. It's more the dozens of endless random butt-kickings you give to street punks start to get pretty tedious and detract from the overall quality of the product. I stuck with the game to finally reach the end as the plot was so good. Overall, a good game that can get on your nerves and takes hours to progress in."
5,this Great Game !!!!!!!!!!!,"Played this game in Japan and have to say I loved it. You play a young Yakuza who has been done over by the bosses. After a spell in jail you are free and out on the streets trying to find out what went wrong. Explore the shops, hostess bars and dingy corners of a major Japanese city and find out who stabbed you in the beack. Game play is repetetive but great fun - the story is deep and engaging! A great game all in all."
4,Looking Forward to Yakuza 2.,"The game was pretty good. The storyline wasn't bad and the learned fighting moves were ok. Looking forward to Yakuza 2, hopefully there will be different fighting styles to choose from and some different free-roaming mini-quests."
2,okay if you want a lot of bb king,"this is a 4 cd compilation with a variety of blues players such as john lee hooker, mississippi john hurt, big joe williams leadbelly and lightenin' hopkins to name a few. however just looking at the titles and artists, you'll notice that b.b. king has 32 songs on this. his songs are almost every other track. i think they could have easily make a cd alone of his material. no liner notes are included. the tracks by the other artists are okay. the packaging says it was remastered, and it does sound okay. i think there a lot more better, thorough and comprehensive blues compilations out there to explore the blues. if you like the artists mentioned and love b.b. king i suppose you'll find this good. also if they have him so many times, why not just put all his songs together rather than stretching them out every other track."
1,embarrassing,"This is simply embarrassing. She is desperately trying to sell her records, even if it means showing her panties although noone wants to see. She bends the way she thinks she needs to sell records. Unbelievable and as embarrassing as Britney"
1,Dirty Crap,"What is happening, holy crap what is she doing?.This song lacks everything. A good sound, beat and it hasn't even got a chorus. I think she's talented and has a wonderful voice and her previous stuff has been good so why not continue that way. Christina clearly want to to look more mature in her music, but this is not the right thing to do, and indroducing b-rapper Redman doesn't make the thing better. Avoid this and wait for better times."
5,"If you don't like it, read this","Alright. First of all, this song is really good. Now, for those of you who are giving bad reviews, they're mostly all the same, so here goes: have you listened to the CD, read the lyrics and looked at the CD jacket??? Apparently not. Christina is just letting loose, just having fun on this track (video...) She's just trying to show who she is and how she really feels on the rest of her album, so this one isn't any different. And the album is NOT ""sexed-up"". ""Dirrty"" is more like a party song (look at the video). There is one song on the album that's about a sexual/physical relationship, but that's it. I really believe that the whole album, including ""Dirrty"", showcases who Christina is at the moment. She's not trying to be someone she's not. Anyway, enough about that. The song is awesome, it has great beats and is just... fun! But get the whole album, it's really good."
2,Unexpected,Was not the sound I was expecting. From the radio songs I had a different idea of what her music was like.
4,Dirtty,"Well,this single is really ""dirty"".You will know what i mean when you just look at the music video.However,it is a nice party anthem,just like Pink's Get The Party Started.In my personal opinion,Dirtty is ""dirtier"" than GTPS.The B-side,I Will Be,no doubt is another great track from Ms.Aguilera.It shows off her vocal again,you can feel her emotion and her soaring yet strong vocal in it,though there is only piano as instrument.For the B-side,you should go and get one for yourself."
2,What the...?,"The first time that i heard this song, I said: What the hell is this, its awful, the only thing good is the voice of christina, and even that I think about it, personally, I think that she's trying so hard to make a good song, the result, a confusing and non-melodic song, Poor girl, I saw the charts and the song only peak 48, with a good reason, Britney will always be the best, no matter what."
1,simply terrible,"what a shame. c.a. was such a talented and beautiful young woman but apparently got some horrible career advice. maybe she wanted to be this way, but most likely, it was a manager, or record company trying to create a even more slutty successor to britney spears. more is not always better, and in this case, it is definitely worse. hopefully, she banked her $$, cuz i can't imagine that she'll ever recover from this debacle. that would be as likely as a porn star trying to make it in hollywood. very sad."
1,the lowest point of the pop industry,[...]She is an entertainer! The problem is: you can't stop the stupid kids for buying the celebrate pop crappy albums today. Who still recognize this maid in the next 10 years? it is the same case like britney spears and spice girls!PS: pls throw away the cd from your window or burn it to the hot ash volcanos!!!Thank god for america's future pop artists like this one!
1,Pure Trash,"What is this?. What were the people involved in the making of this thinking?!. Christina has stated that she wants to get even naughtier and push the envelope. She has no idea at all on what to do. This is a ridiculous and sleazy song. The title of the thing pretty much says it all. It's trashy and has no catch, beat, or any redeeming value to the listener or to any die hard Christina fan. It is clearly the product of an artist who is so desperate to be adult and edgy, that she forget that you have to actually grow up first. This is going in the wrong direction for Christina and her career. It will only bring the wrong kind of attention and will seriously effect her and her career. I hope she wises up and takes care of her career. This is pure trash. Dirty indeed."
5,Complete shock!,"I love ""Dirrty""! It's a great pop song & the video was hot too. I don't know why people make such a big deal about it. I've seen Madonna do alot worse. I like this song because it has a great dance beat & it really makes you wanna get down. I love her transformation from bubbly teen to sexy young woman, it was shocking to many but I like it."
5,Feel good single of the year,"I didn't like it all that much at first listen because it's such a different sound than I'm used to from Christina, but I like it more and more every time I listen to it. I just can't help but get pumped up when this song is being blasted out of my car stereo speakers. Dirrty is one of Christina's bests."
2,DiRRty!? What!?,"i'm sorry, this song does NOTHING to show her vocal talent at all. it's horrible (the video is even worse!). the additional track on this single, I Will Be, on the other hand is great. it's a beautiful song. i'm hoping DiRRty doesn't set the mold for the new album...that'll be a shame. i have heard a track called Beautiful and i think it's pretty great. DiRRty is HORRIBLE."
1,good voice weak song,"She can Sing unlike Brittney,J-Lo&Others but when She does watered down Material that they do it makes her on line with them which is not a Compliment for Her as a Artist.this song quickly is forgotten&only the video keeps you interested&that has nothing too do with the Song whatsoever."
3,Will women be admitted to a city of ladies?,"Christine de Pizan's book is very interesting from historic and literary perspectives. This defense of virtuous women, who are drawn primarily from Chrisitian and Classical mythology, is an important work from the first European woman to support herself by writing. Although her ideas may seem conservative and outdated, and may disappoint modern feminists, but they are interesting and intelligent"
2,"5 stars for the original poetry, 1 star for the translations","Rilke is just about my favourite poet... a true master. In the German, his verse is just sublime.These translations, however, are shockingly bad. Not only does the translator completely ignore (or distort) some of the key images, he invents new ones for no apparent reason. Mitchell seems to think he is there to improve on the original. He doesn't.If you don't read German, you should only buy this to read Mitchell's verse. You won't be getting Rilke's."
3,Suspicious Translation,"The three stars I give this book are more for Rilke than for his rather poor translator.I first became suspicious of Stephen Mitchell when I noticed some rather careless mistakes in this book (for instance, translating the German word for Moon into sun).But I was no longer suprised by these flaws when I noticed some other works that Mitchell has translated:the Bhagavad-GitaThe Book of JobThe GospelThe Tao-Te-ChingI suppose it is theoretically possible for there to exist an individual that is so immensely talented with languages that he is capable of translating adequately texts from Sanskrit, Hebrew, Ancient Greek, Classical Chinese, and German.... But I don't think Mitchell is that individual.That being said, the poetics of the translation are very nice and the poems to feel pretty close to Rilke. However, to do this (whom I consider the most profound poet to ever take up a pen) author justice, I am just going to have to learn German for myself"
4,"JEAN-PIERRE MELVILLE, OPUS ONE","One of these films that stay for days in your head after you've seen it. Like The Uncle and The Niece, you'll be hypnotized by Werner von Ebrennac's thoughts about Europa, Art and Hope for a better world. A movie that shouldn't be neglected when we talk about Jean-Pierre Melville. Highly recommended."
3,adequate job of portraying a challenging novella on the screen,"Jean-Pierre Melville's rendition does the Vercors novella justice, but only partially conveys the tensions, emotions, and tested loyalties of passive-resistant citizens and their Nazi occupiers in World War II France.True to form, however, Melville's camera techniques employing tilted angles, extreme close-ups, etc. are superb."
1,a dated movie,"For the majority part of the 88 minutes long movie, there is only the German officer's monologue while the other 2 actors mouths shut all the time. While his speeches may be interesting, the movie cannot compare with the high quality of the director's later works such as Le Circle Rouge or Le Samourai."
5,French classic,"Although this is a World War II war movie, it's also a relationship movie where only one character really talks. This character is a German officer foisted on a French man and his widowed daughter-in-law just after the Germans conquered France in 1940. If I remember correctly, the story was written in 1941 or 1942. It also examines what happens when good people work for bad causes. This was Jean-Pierre Melville's first movie."
5,A Very Real Life Model,I work driving a school bus. I train people to drive a school bus also. I use the bus to explain parking methods since the bus is large enough to use as a good example. The kids on the bus really like the bus. They fight over who is going to play with the bus. This is a very good quality strong bus.
4,Great Product!,There were a lot of helpful information in this book from personal stories to training tips. It came quick and is a great product
3,My favourite band before they were my favourite band,"This isn't a particularly great album, but the Silver Jews only made three particularly great albums, and most days, I prefer this to their up-tempo later work. ""Trains Across the Sea"" is the only real standout here -- it doesn't seem to have aged at all -- but a lot of fans like ""New Orleans"" and ""Advice to the Graduate."""
5,Berman & Malkmus are Shining!,"The Two Extraordinary Gentlemen and their Cast of Thousands are truly Shining to-night. Now The Other Half Lives, but back in the Day, yes, back in the Day... D. C. Berman and Mister Malkmus bounce off of each other as Happily as could possibly be Expected."
4,i found this 2 be a good buy,"I liked this gun very much. It has a nice capacity and nice power( i get shot w/ it all the time, it wont do any serious damage) WARNING- do not try to use the silencer to fire- the only way it will work well is if you screw it in really tightly, and if you do this, there is a good chance that the barrel will be pulled out"
5,Whoah.,"This gun is awesome. It does have a few problems though. Its pretty hard to reload, compared to most pistols. If you accidentaly let go of the button, all the BBs fly out. I didnt get a silencer, but after looking at the reviews, I decided not to send it back anyway. This gun has great sights. Its also very accurate and powerful. The perfect gun if you just want to play around in the neighborhood with your friends."
5,mac11,"This gun is dead on accurate and shoots amazingly well for the price. I have a lot of airsoft guns and this is by far one of the best, my brother shot me with it and now its a black and blue welt, so yeah i'm pretty sure its powerful. The gun seems lighter than it looks but really its heavy for the size which is good because it means the gun wont fall apart, so i promise you when you get this you wont be disappointed."
1,"Low budget, bad acting, poor all the way around..","I cannot believe all the positive reviews for this movie...everything was bad..the acting was absolutely the worst..ok ok it's a tribute and a real story..I get that that's fine...bored to death watching..the battle scenes were unrealistic and uninteresting..sure there's the emotional aspect..I guess that is what has everyone hooked..sorry unconvincing performances by all the actors..""Don"" has absolutely no emotion....don't waste your time or money...some people compared this to ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers""....not on your life...only thing it had in common with those was it was a WWII picture...totally lacking in depth..looked like it would not even pass as a made for tv movie...I tried..wanted a good WWII movie..ultimate FAIL."
1,SUCKS! SUCKS! SUCKS!,"Horrible acting, horrible plot. Good idea just some very lame actors who need to go back to acting school."
1,everyman's war,"AMAZON NEEDS TO START THE PREVIEWS, FROM WHERE THE MOVIE STARTS , YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE WHATS THE MOVIE ABOUT , FROM THE STARTING CREDITS TAKE UP THE WHOLE 2 MIN'S , HAVE TO GO ON THE WEB ELSEWHERE JUST TO SEE A DECENT PREVIEW OF MOVIEI GAVE IT A 1 CAUSE I CAN'T SEE WHATS THE MOVIE ABOUT"
1,Unwatchable,"This is unwatchable. The writing is awful, the acting is even worse. These people need to seriously reconsider their professions. I'm sure they're all experienced Waiters. I wonder where they work and how the food and service is there."
4,Not your usual shoot'em up war movie,"Somehow I got the impression that this was a documentary about the Battle of the Bulge, but it turned out to be a feature film. It's a good one, but it's not a typical action packed war movie, it's about the characters in a squad, particularly Smith. You may be hoping for more explosions and shooting (I was in the mood for it), but it turns out to be a pretty good film. The only thing I have to complain about as being erroneous is that many of the characters were complaining about being drafted or being sent to war. At that time, EVERYONE wanted to do their part; EVERYONE wanted to join the military after Pearl Harbor. The only one that did not, and weaseled his way out, was Frank Sinatra and he was justly despised by many for his cowardice"
5,perfect fit,this jacket was a perfect fit for our dog It is easy to put on him It is also well made so it should hold up with multiple ons and offs
4,Great movie soundtrack,The music for this series was well done. You can easily imagine the roar of the high performance engines and the squealing of the tires. Nice beats. I enjoyed this soundtrack alot.
2,Agree with What a Letdown,I also do not understand all the rave reviews about this book. I gave up after about Chapter 4 and skimmed through to the end in about 15 minutes. I agree with one of the other reviewers that I got tired of reading Katie repeating her thoughts and did not think she was a particularly strong character. Jonathan struck me as a little whiney also. I had already figured out the bad guy by the second chapter but even he turned out to be just a weak link.
3,Humdrum.,"I usually enjoy Ms. Davis' books at least 4 stars, but this one kept putting me to sleep. If you can make it to the end, it gets a little better. I almost gave up two or three times.Am I the only one who feels this way?"
5,She's done it again!,Another great romantic suspense from Dee Davis. This is one author who just keeps on getting better and better!
2,sloppy formatting and too many errors,"This book has the right idea: a pocket-sized book with a good variety of useful everyday phrases, organized by subject. However, there are enough flat-out mistakes to be pretty annoying. Also, the English and Japanese did not line up perfectly on the page which, in combination with the the print being quite small, made it difficult to figure out which defintion went where (perhaps this is not a problem with all these books but it was with mine). But most annoying are the errors and typos."
4,Japanese Made Easy,I found this book very useful and easy to understand. I would recommend this book to people who have had no background in the language and those who have studied but have forgotten some of it. This book is very practical and may inspire to want to learn more Japanese!
5,This book is great! ( MY review) I'm a skitzo and so am I!,"this book is wonderful! It's perfect for a traveler or someone who just wants to learn Japanese. It gives you uncompleted sentences like ""I like-"" or ""I have a-"" and then provides you with words in the English-Japanese dictionary in the back. It also has things listed by categories like ""student life"" and ""request and complaints"". In the back there is also a Japanese-English dictionary. This awesome book also contains the Hiranga and Katakana alphabets. I highly recommend this book to anyone who's even bothered to read my reveiw."
3,Useful inspite of itself.,"I bought this on my first flight back from Japan after taking my first semester in Japanese. I thought that it supplied a ton of useful auxillary vocabulary to run with at the level of grammar I was capable of using. The book also has many slight mistakes, even I, a first year student, was able to pick out. It's got a few cute but dumb, potentially racist but we'll say ignorant drawings included. But so few that it cues one in as to how cheaply produced this probably was. I give it three stars though because I learned it forward and backward and broke it out numerous times to meet my needs in bars and train stations (never in restaurants for some reasons). And, to get me comic leverage in many conversations where I was not privy to the Japanese side of the chatter."
3,great but not for IPOD users,"If you plan to upload it on ITUNES,be ready to have a headache.It's not labeled so you just see multiple track 1, 2..........pain in the b..t."
3,9 cds but only a few new words,"About 40% of the information (words) on these CDs I already knew, another 30% I knew but hearing the definition refined them for me, 20% of what's on the CDs is fluff (useless) information and the rest are the new words I didn't know. I had a tough time understanding the woman speaker but the male voice usually repeats the words, spelling and definition.It's not a bad set especially if you are just learning the English language but definitely not the words I occasionally need to look up in my reading.We tried to listen to these on a five hour drive but this was the first time I nearly fell asleep driving!"
3,Vocabularly Building Skills - Beginning Level,"I liked the way the authors say, define, and spell the words, however I was disappointed on the level of vocabularly used for this series. I was hoping to build a more sophisticated vocabularly, but I found that the words on these CDs are at a basic level: everyday words I already knew and use. I would recommend these CDs for high school seniors or freshman college level students who are beginning to learn about the mastery of using words. Maybe not for the more advanced student, professional or executive looking to build a spohisticate, powerful vocabulary"
5,Kept me engaged and motivated to learn effortlessly!,"Denis Waitlely is a best selling author, dynamic speaker and motivator and in this audio book it's apparent why. He is able to engage you and motivate you while providing unique tools to build your vocabulary with minimum effort and time. This audio book is wonderful for everyone who seeks to improve themselves and enhance their vocabulary and a great way to get high school students prepared for their SAT's without even realizing that they're studying!"
4,Like it,"I enjoyed the CD, especially like the background music and the voices of commentators, they were very clear and persuasive. The one thing I enjoyed the most from these CD's was actually seeing these words used in literature and advertising."
2,From Gehenna to Here,Don't really understand the point of this. It's just the Laura Ablum (FOTN worst by a long shot) with the songs re-arranged.I won't get it...I have owned Laura for years and listened to it maybe 3 times. Do yourself a favour and by revelations or Elizium or Earth Inferno(live) before this.
4,Curious George DVD,Arrived in a timely fashion and was packaged like new. Won't know if the DVD is good until Christmas Day; it was a gift.
5,Awesome for young children,My 2-year-old nephew is mesmerized by Curious George and his older siblings enjoy the activities and discussion after each episode.
5,Yah Baby Yah!,"Girl Power is back with Emma Bunton's new single, Maybe. It is a unique and fun song filled with 60's grooves and catchy lyrics. I can just see Emma as the next Austin Powers girl singing this funky tune! This song is quite different from Emma's last solo effort...showcasing her wide range of style and talent! If you are a fan of the Spice Girls or fun pop music I highly recommend this song...it definitely has a Spice World vibe!"
3,MAYBE theres hope For Emma,"Well to be quite honest i did not and still do like Emma, she is my least favorite spice. I think Victoria sounds better.But in event when I heard this song I liked it instantly.I hated Free Me but this song was catchy.Its a whole lot better than her previous work We're Not Gonna Sleep Tonight etc.. It sounds like I've heard it before like its a lame copy of a Geri Halliwell song.(Personally I like Geri and Mel C the most)This does not change how i feel about Emma. I'm still not a fan but I must give credit where credit is due, this MAYBE (no pun) her best song. Its catchy and danceable and video is not too bad, maybe there's hope for her."
5,Great Song,"I gotta say, I'm a devout Melanie C fan. I'm also big with the Spice Girls, but Emma just blew me away with this one. This is the first solo song I've heard of her's and I was just amazed. I knew she had talent but WOW! I've been folowing the Girl Power group since they started and I must say I'm very impressed. I haven't got the single yet but I can't wait."
1,My first review was denied..,just to make it short and sweet these do NOT come with the bands. Picture is extremely deceiving. False advertisement. And I couldn't cancel my order even though it wasn't shipped. BAD service
2,What good are these without the bands,The picture shows the lids with the bands. I was disappointed this item arrived with no bands to hold the lids onto the jar. I cant think of a situation where just having the lid with no band would be useful and was surprised this item got such high ratings.
2,No rings,"Beware, these are tops only, not complete lids with rings. If you don't have existing rings, these are useless."
1,I DO NOT recommend This SELLER,I DO NOT recommend this seller. They misrepresent what they sell!They are NOT good with returns. Walmart is better for this product!
4,Use regularly at our house,"No problem with the product....seals jars well, which is what it is suppose to do. However, AMZN is higher priced on this product that the local grocery store. The local grocery store (I discovered after buying it once or twice via AMZN) has them for about half the cost so I have since stayed with buying them locally rather than online.Gave them 4 stars rather than 5 because I don't understand why this product needs to be so high online."
1,huge dissapointment,I ordered decorative lids...the picture on amazon was decorative lids and I ordered them.. I received plain lids....I returned them (which meant a 40 mile round trip drive to town) with a note explaining that they were the wrong product...the website said I could not have a refund so I asked them to please send me what I ordered....I received the same wrong product again...and it costs twice as much as I could have originally gotten it at town....not what I expect from Amazon Prime service.
4,Good but unexpected,"These are perfect, good and sturdy. Only, I expected them to fit the 8 oz wide mouths (which is what I have an abundance of and bought them for)and they don't. They are for the large 32 oz jars. I wish that would have been specified (I checked, it wasn't) Also, they did not come with the bands, another unexpected, but surely that must be my fault."
5,Easy and great service,"I ordered the canning lids from Amazon because I had been to several stores in the Chicago area, and they were not available at this time of year. I found them at Amazon at a great price, ordered them, and had them in a few days. Easy! Next time I will not waste my time running around searching for them."
3,Wish it came with the rings!,Why is it so hard to buy rings WITH lids. Product picture is very misleading. It's JUST the center of the lids.
4,New to the ball jar world & misunderstood,"New to the ball jar world & misunderstood, I thought these came with the screw top part too so I was disappointed to get half of what I thought I ordered. Need to b a little clearer for us nubbies"
3,slasher film,"Granted, as a horror movie, Evil Judgement does not succeed (half of the ""horror"" is obscured by terrible cinematography and lighting, you're kind of guessing what's going on as if it's an abstract painting or something...), but, for synthesizer score/slasher film fans this movie is truly unique. Yes, by 1980 synthesizer score as mainstream was pretty much alive. But for anyone who has never lost their like for synthesizer score music and enjoys discovering the nostalgia of it all, Evil Judgement offers something interesting. For anyone who really knows synthesizer score (I know, scary thought...) you'll recognize the music which was immensely popular by 1980."
5,Wonderful book,"This book is a wonderful loving ""heart-poem"" from a woman and a wife searching for meaning in her life. As a Catholic I loved her way of seeing the sacraments and loving her daily life. Used it as a small group book and it led to many points of discussion.(non-Catholics could also relate) Good book to take down from the shelf every now and then."
1,Poor Linux support,"Although advertising Linux support, don't expect a typical level of support for this product. Unlike most Linux drivers, the driver for this product is maintained outside of the kernel and is far behind. Because it is outside of the kernel, it isn't included in any Linux distributions. We're not even talking RAID support here -- you can't even access your disks individually. Even if you don't mind installing the driver yourself, good luck if you are running any recent version of Linux. The driver page ([...]) hasn't been updated since 2009. The last 5 versions of Fedora are completely unsupported by the driver, and the last 3 don't even work if you manually compile the driver. Even the latest version of RedHat Enterprise Linux is completely unsupported.Buyer beware!"
4,Good RAID Controller,"The only issue I encountered was trying to boot my computer up for the first time with the raid controller and all my new hard drives plugged in. It would crash during boot up. It would never make it to Windows. Through some trial and error, I found that my computer was able to boot when all of the hard drives were disconnected from the raid controller. At that point I was able to boot into Windows to apply firmware updates to the card. I was also able to get the software installed on my computer. At that point, I simply plugged in the hard drives and everything worked like a charm.Works like it should."
4,Pistol Grip Shotgun Spring Airsoft Rifle,"I don't car much for the pistol but I can say a lot fro the shotgun. The shotgun has a high fire rate and hurts like a ""skeeter!"" The only reason for it to break is if you over cock it or slam it against a tree really hard."
5,SWEET,THE THING HOLDS 250BBS NOT 60 AND THE MINI PISTIOL IS NASTY AND EASY TO TUCK IN YOUR SHOE!!!!!
5,brain-haunting stuff,"This was a throwaway impulse buy, which turned into a soundtrack for my life. It goes against every rule of modern rock: its, primitively recorded, played on a single, twangy acoustic guitar, sung in a kind of awkward, swooping falsetto and lasts less than thirty minutes. It is also the one of the most intelligent, literate and intensely moving albums of the nineties. If you have any kind of heart, brain or soul, you should buy this and prepare to be haunted for the rest of your life."
5,palace days always a constant companion,"This is a bit misleading as the CD is ""Days in the Wake"" and the LP is simply Palace brothers which I was listening to the former first. Regardless this is classic Will Oldham is his formative years as a truly great artist. Highly recommended."
1,"This is not music, it is a hoax.","Do you know two chords on a guitar? Good!Now settle down in a comfy chair, enjoy three or four of your favorite beverages and strum those two chords while reciting words from your local newspaper's classified section at random.You have now reproduced this album.Cut a CD, have a few friends write glowing reviews, and your name too will be immortalized as a grunge artist.Bet you can't bring yourself to listen to the entire album!"
4,Decent pants,"I bought these for a beach wedding, which is about the only reason I would ever buy white pants like these. For the intended purpose they worked great. If you order the long sizes as I did, be prepared to have them hemmed as they are very long. I have a 34 inch inseam, and rolled them about 5-6 inches."
5,"Helpful, informative, powerful!","Only 3 chapters into the book, I can easily say this is one of the most helpful, powerful books I have ever seen.The stories from Jose's life are fascinating, as always. And the reason I've read only 3 chapters is that each one is so full of information that it takes a long time to ""get"" it all! I keep going over and over it.Jose is a powerful, captivating writer, and this may be his best."
5,A Book with Heart & Wisdom,"A highly recommended purchase, this wonderful book is a fine addition to any true seeker's spiritual arsenal. Jose speaks and projects truth from the heart, weaving effective techniques for powerful prayer with the wisdom and insight of many indigenous teachings and perspectives. ""Praying With Power"" acted as a catalyst for my partner and I, creating a fresh and much needed renaissance of prayer in our lives. For this we are grateful and hope that others read and enjoy the inspiriational message found within the pages of this book."
2,it's ok.....,"i love this author. this is the least of my favorites of his books though. i just couldnt read the whole thing. i think it was due to the fact that i was brought up in a southern baptist home and have a bad taste in my mouth from that.... this book reminded me of that time in my life with a lot of the same verbage and talk. it probably is just a person issue, but i love every other book that i have read of Mr. Stevens'!!"
1,"Awful, time I will never get back","This may be the worst book I have ever read. It is awful, repetative, the plot is painfully slow. This book was awful."
5,It Makes a Difference,"Picked this up in the airport on yet another frenetic trip. I'd been having problems with memory loss: work very stressful, home very stressful - the usual. Thought, ""Hmmm, Maybe all the chips and chocolate isn't the answer.""This book put it all in perspective. It was easy to dip in and read the bits that applied to me. I made some basic changes - just one at first (gave up coffee) then more (more fish, better vitamins, less fried food). Years of poor nutrition had made me forget what it's like to feel good.Highly recommended - clearly written, easy to understand, this book could really make a difference in your life."
5,A must read for everyone,"This book and the book ""Optimum Nutrition For Your Child's Mind"" by the same author are fantastic. They clearly outline how your brain works and what it needs in order to function at top level. In the U.S. people tend to pop a pill for whatever ails them but all they are doing is covering up the real problems and creating new ones. These books will open your eyes to how ridiculous it is for doctors to prescribe a potentially dangerous pill without first testing your biochemistry and searching for a cause that can be treated naturally."
3,Chairman of the Board (Recording),"Yet another mixing-board tape, with some of the proceeds benefiting Vito, Dino, Jamie, et al. The set is performed by a seemingly distracted Johnny, perhaps ill, perhaps thinking of the use of night's proceeds (those neon-green suits required a trip to Thailand--never an inexpensive undertaking). The line-up of songs is a fine, but expected selection; the lack of Walter Lure and Jerry Nolan obvious. Two fellows from Hanoi Rocks, including Andy McCoy (perhaps Johnny's most talented acolyte), close the set with a raucous version of ""Pills."" This cannot save a lackluster effort. Better to buy ""Live at Max's"" to understand what the late Sr. Genzale could do."
4,Classic English Folk music that spans Centuries,Overall a very nice set covering a wide variety of the English Folk Artists that have been prominant over the past couple of decades. Not always the best possible track by the artist but a great compendium of the most famous as well as performers that have not had as much of the limelight in British Folk music. Several of the musicians are featured in several different groups that they have performed with. I've listened most of these performers three decades ago and they are still out there making music. You can tell it's a labor of love.
1,Not very informative,"This is a poorly written book. The author clearly states thatthis bookis not for the novice programmer but for those experienced in C/C++ and Windows programming. However, after reading this book, I fail to find how this book can be of benefit to any programmer, novice or otherwise. The book is primarily fluff, without any satisfying explanation of the concepts presented. The explanation of the MFC classes are a prime example of what is wrong with this book. There are samples of MFC coding generated from the AppWizard, but little clarity in explaining the ""nuts and bolts"" behind the code. True, a seasoned MFC programmer would understand the material presented, but then again, a seasoned MFC programmer would find little in this book that he does not already know. If the book is too confusing for a beginner and yet at the same time does not present adequate technical explanations for the professional, whom are the book's intended audience?"
3,Isn't useful for those who don't know Windows programming,"As a person who is very competent in C++, I expected this book to be useful for learning those elements of Visual C++ that are specific to programming for Windows 95/NT. I was grossly mistaken. This book assumes that you are familiar with Windows programming (perhaps using C), and helps you make a transition to Visual C++. For those who are already familiar with Visual C++, it gives tips and tricks to get the most out of the system. Perhaps this is the norm for ""Unleashed"" books (this happened to be my first one). It just didn't work for me."
4,Good Book -- but not for beginners,"This book has a good general overview of many of the power-tools in the Visual C++ development system. It is definitely not written for beginners, however.The included CD-ROM is of little use except for source code."
5,Heavy and solid base with very even grit,"Decided to spend the extra money and get a quality super-fine stone for my shop tools. Massive improvement over cheaper stones. The base is a solid chunk of metal, so very heavy and very stiff. I don't feel the stone flex at all, even when really pushing to sharpen the irons on my hand planes.An extra bonus too - the sheath that comes with it can be cut apart and turned into a pair of leather strops. Haven't mounted them yet, but they're the perfect size!"
2,Not so great for math beginners,"Readers will find that they need advanced calculus to get anything out of this book. Despite what the author states about the book being easy for a beginning derivatives math student to follow, I think you'll find that the level of math needed to keep up with the reading is fairly high level. This is why I gave the book only 2 stars."
5,Perfect!,"I had a course of stochastic processes four years ago. A month ago I needed to revive my faded (and very weak) knowledge of stochastic calculus and to learn more as much and as fast as I can. I checked a lot of books about stochastic calculus and financial math, but this book is the best one (of those which I saw) which gives a simple but a rigorous treatment of the subject. If something is not proved then for the case there is an explicit reference to a text. I believe if you have some knowledge of probability it is a very good book to start to learn stochastic calculus."
5,Stochastic Calculus,"Klebaner's book is a good next step after an operational grasp of Shreve's Vol-II on continuous time. Klebaner's book (CH 1-10 of 14) enhances the mathematical details (including semi-martingales and jump processes) to the next friendly level. Klebaner gives a number of illuminating {Examples, Remarks}, often, immediately following {Definitions, Theorems}. The chapters 11-14 on applications to finance, biology and engineering are not the strength of the book, and perhaps not intended by the author to be so. Reading the book will reinforce what was learnt in Shreve's, and fill in more details. Possibly a good prelude to the next level book on Stochastic Integration by Protter."
1,Not for Beginners!,"The author states that you only need a basic knowledge ofcalculus and probablity. I strongly disagree! Firstly, this book isfull on notation, which makes it feel like you're reading a technical manual rather than a book. The level of mathematical understanding neccesary to get anything out of this book would have included coursework in advanced calculus, ODE, and PDE. I put the book back on the shelf after the first few pages. A much better book for the beginning financial engineer would be Salih Neftci's, which I gave 5 stars to."
2,Don't buy this!,"I am so dissatisfied with the Adam Hersh posters. I ordered two and regret it! They are not clear, photo-like prints, but rather ""colored-pencil"" like prints. If that's what you are looking for, then by all means, go with these. If you want more realistic prints- look else where!"
4,Adorable,"This was for a gift to a teacher so I don't know how well it's held up, but when I received it and openened it, it was adorable. Really brought me back home. I'm from Florida and live in GA now, so this really made me nostalgic. I plan on getting one for myself. I gave it 4 stars because I think the price is a little high. If they'd at least throw in free shipping, it would help."
3,oops,"Didn't realize it's a kids book... Oh well. Has some funny things like saying ""marmots are OVERSIZED SQUIRRELS"". Maybe more accurate somehow than I realize, but I bet a kid that could read this could handle the real thing."
2,corny,im sorry im a lover of classic films but this film was corny. I appreciate seeing the beautiful classy Lena Horne and the handsome and distinguished Ralph Cooper. Yet unless you want to see the two of them and have some classic footage its not that good.
2,All things considered the movie really wasn't that bad. The quality of picture was sacrificed by the condition of the film .,The quality of the picture was sacrificed by the condition of the original master. There are a lo of scratches here and there so don't expect exceptional picture quality. It did hold my attention.Overall I would say it is O.K.
2,BEFORE BLAXTATION,"WOW WE WERE EASILY AMUSED.FOR HISTORY SAKE OF THE STRUGGLE FOR BLACK MOVIES, IT HAS EVOLVED A LONG WAY,"
5,Understanding UK patent law,"Patent law is hard for non-lawyers to understand, and is not made much clearer by reading statutes, in the US, or in the UK. This 722-page, 1996 book explains UK patent law in an understandable way. It corresponds to a US patent law book, ""Patent Law & Practice"" by H.F Schwartz in that the Cornish book explains UK patent law, complete with citations to UK cases, such that it can be applied by Experts assisting in patent litigation."
3,"Pretty basic, but plenty of good advice","The kitchen volume of this series is much more detailed. Since there are lots of different types of additions for lots of different reasons, it's hard to get into much detail in one book. Still, the advice it does dispense strikes me as sound. It includes a checklist of things you will need to look after if you decide to act as your own contractor, or just check up on if you hire a contractor.tis is a fine book for those in the early stages of planning an addition who have no experience of such matters."
1,Complete junk,"The moment I opened the package the retractor part was totally broken, I still have an Ipod cable but the item itself is just pure junk."
3,Retractable IPod sync cord,"The product's idea is great. The actual mechanics of it, are not the best. I find that the ease of use is sometimes difficult. While it appears the cord will pull out and slide in with ease, that is rarely the case. I often have to pull the cord several times for it to wind itself back up in the correct position. While it is a nifty idea, the mechanics leave much to be desired."
4,Performs as stated!,"This device performs just as it should. I did find that it sometimes tends to rewind/retract itself when not desired. This is a minor inconvenience. Overall, I appreciate having the backup capability and portability it provides. Good work!"
2,iPhone or iPod Touch in a case? You probably shouldn't buy this.,"I just received this item today. While it does work well, for now, it does NOT attach to my iPhone while it's in my Otterbox case. The end that connects to your iPhone or iPod is wider and thicker than the factory standard one your iPhone/iPod ships with. I don't care how cheap it is, it's poorly designed, considering the substantial percentage of people who keep their iPhones and iPods in cases to prevent damage. Also, the holes the cable is fed through on each side are larger than need be, allowing for the cable to easily twist and potentially tangle during retraction. So, 2 stars, and it's only 2 because it actually functions upon delivery."
1,Cheap Product,"It worked well for about 2 months, then it failed. The construction seemed solid enough at first, but apparently it wasn't up to the stresses of daily use. (I only ever used it at my desk. I kept it retracted generally and would extend it just a little bit each time I plugged in my iPhone.) I'm going to stay away from retracting cords like this one from now on. None of them seem to get good reviews for reliability."
3,"Works for charging, I wouldn't try to sync with it.","This definitely works for charging your iPod Touch or iPhone, but I wouldn't suggest trying to sync data with it. The construction is not the best, and the plug going in to the iDevice is not a perfect fit. With a thick case on your device, the plug will probably not fit at all. Also, although the cord is retractible, it's very short - even shorter than the stock sync/charge cable."
5,Retractable Ipod USB 2.0 Sync,"Retractable Ipod USB 2.0 SyncThis Ipod USB Cable works perfect in my 2G nano. It also works fine with the Ipod touch. I like the retractable mechanism because I can carry it in my pocket with no problem. It can be ajusted as you want it, when it's close to my laptop there's not this long cable around, I just fit it. I also use it with my AC-charger. If the outlet is too low or too high, the retractable USB Cable may be too short to put you ipod on your desk. It's about 2 feet long."
1,Broke with the first use,"While I cannot complain about the price, the first time I used this the spring came flying out and it is no longer retractable...Of course, the only reason I bought it was because it was retractable, so it is no of no use to me."
1,Did not work,"When I connect my ipod, my PC recognizes the device but cannot read the contents. Tried this on my laptop as well with the same results. It didn't charge the ipod either. Maybe I just got unlucky with a broken one but it was so cheap, that I did not bother to return it."
3,Oops! My Bad...,"I made an assumption that this cable would work with my Creative Zen Vision:M because it had the same connection, but I was wrong. It is for iPod only! I was drawn to it because it is retractable, major plus. I'm sure it would work for an iPod, but since I am anti-Apple, I haven't tried it to make sure."
2,Scam on shipping fees,"I noticed that this item ask for only 5 cents, and I feel that why not give it a chance. 5 cents is too cheap to believe, and thus I order two items for myself (one for car, and one for backpack). I quickly notice that they ""double"" the shipping fee even you put two items on the same order. It make no sense to me since double the weight should not affect the shipping fee at all. It's a tiny, light item. Suddenly I understand the seller is playing a trick that shift the price to the shipping & ""handling"". I pay identical price for shipping a ""heavy book"" in standard speed. Thus, I think obviously that they are making money through the ""handling"" part. I still give a two stars because 3 dollars to me is still very cheap. However, I hope the item can arrive as they promised."
1,Will not synch IPod Touch 4G.,"I just ordered two of these and wasted my money. When I use it to connect to Itunes it either doesn't detect the IPod at all or it says Itunes can't read it and wants to format. However, the Ipod does get a charge off the cable. Once again, you get what you pay for."
2,Does not work with iphone 3gs,"Does not work with the iPhone 3GS. I bought 4 after reading good reviews, and I am upset that they would advertise that it would work.When I connect my phone and computer with the USB cord, I get a message that says: ""This device is not supported,"" and it won't charge or sync. If I unplug it several times I can force it to charge my phone, but when I think about it I probably shouldn't do that anymore since the cord is clearly not supported (safe) for iPhone usage.The retractable cord works well. But it's pretty short--about the length of a normal USB cord or less (fully extended length is 32 inches).For $1, it's about what you'd expect if you bought an iPhone cord from the dollar store down the street."
2,The sofisticated retractable mechnism broke,"A couple of months after I bought this, the retractable cable mechanism broke, leaving me with a cord that was tangled up inside. My advice is to carefully handle the cord, while pulling the two sides of it apart to lengthen it."
4,not bad you can hear the deathrow influence,not a bad jam love the isaac hayes sample from the look of love brings back old school memories the video is tight reminds me of fighting with my girl.
1,poor sizing,"very poor sizing.. very disappointed when i recieved my boots. i read the other reviews to make sure the sizing was true to size the shaft of the boot is soooo.. off im a thick bottom girl thick thighs and booty .. howver i am a size 8 in boots the 8 was like a 6 5""6 about 145 pds these boots are not worth buying poor quality as well."
1,ITS A RIP OFF,I ORDERED THESE BOOTS FOR MY WIFE THEY BILLED MY CREDIT CARD AND NEVER SENT THE BOOTS. NOW THEY REFUSE TO REFUND MY CARD.
2,Not sure it's the best place to start your Smog collection,"While I dug Smog's album from a few years back ""Supper,"" I didn't find much appealing about this one."
1,disappointing,"the only good thing about this player is that you can play mp3, but that costs an extra $40! I could barely see the screen it was really blurry and it doesn't have any sponge bob my favorite show."
1,Awful product,"I feel as if I must warn everyone out there. This is a now defunct product and either the MP3 itself or the website will give your computer a virus that will hide all of your music and photo files, destroy all of your files in windows media player, and basically just wreak chaos on your pc for your music AND PHOTOS. Beware!"
3,JUICEBOX JUNK!,"The Juice box, is really not worth 50 dollars or up. It is a Really Really bad BUY! I mean it fits in beetween your thumb and index finger. The screen is so small. And I think you'd be better off buying a game boy advance sp. Because thy are bigger,you can play your favorite video games on them, and watch really cool shows. So this christmas Dont buy juice box, Buy something better like a GAMEBOY ADVANCE sp and get more for your Money."
2,Juice Box,"This toy is too much money. Not as clear,not as more shows than video now. I would advise you to get a video now color."
3,Helpful in some areas,Jeanne makes some points that are helpful but it seems that many of the ideas are unrealistic in the context of your average church.
5,Great Resource for Youth Pastors!!,If you are a youth pastor this is a fantastic tool to help breathe some life into your ministry. Jeanne's heart for youth matched together with her brilliant strategies makes this a must buy if you are looking for building an authentic and thriving youth ministry!
5,Smile... you found it!,Jeanne Mayo mixes relevance and relationship into a practical guide to loving today's generation back to life!Awesome Book!
3,Very disturbing indictment of reality.,"What and how do we really remember? Is memory ever really ""the truth""? And why are all these people remembering things that supposedly never happened, yet are willing to destroy their lives in the process of asserting their perception of reality? Although this book has more questions than answers, it is very thought provoking and enlightening."
3,It's ok,"Boring at times, may too much detail about experiements and backstories that i felt wasn't necessary. Sometimes less is more.."
1,Hardly an objective account,"A thoughtful reader will ask how this book can be purported to be objective when a key person (Holly Ramona) was never interviewed. A key to the slant of this book is in the title itself, ""Spectral Evidence,"" which is suggestive of ""no evidence."" What, then, could account for the estrangement of Holly, her sister and mother, from Gary Ramona?"
1,"I borrowed this book from my local ibrary, it is","A book dealing with a very influential topic yet is very boring. The author writes in a very academic, dry fashion."
1,Green-Um,"I found that Green-Um did not help one bit. Although a little tomato juice in the water did not eleminate the problem, it certainly worked better than Green-Um."
5,Very useful for understanding every aspect of e-business.,"I have read dozens of books on e-business and this book is the best. I keep referring to it over and over again for different areas when I need to do so and have always found it most helpful. It is very readable and easy to understand. Other books pale in comparism. I can't heap any more praise to it then to say that I have bought more copies for my friends who have also found it so useful when they have borrowed mine, and have found the need to own their own copy. A good introduction to every aspect of e-business."
5,Great resource for e-business,This great book offers a very complete guide to all important topics around the Internet and E-Business. I like the style and the tone of the writing and it is very interesting to see the author dig into business and technology at the same time without losing himself in unnecessary details.
1,Please edit this book!,"I asked for and received this book as a Christmas gift, hoping to get a good overview of the mechanisms and strategies of e-business. After trying to read this book for five minutes, however, I put it down in frustration over the horrendous quality of writing. It is clear that this book was written by a non-native English speaker, and was not edited prior to release. Virtually every sentence contains multiple grammatical, typographic, or construction errors, making it impossible to focus on the content. That's too bad, because it looks like it may contain a lot of useful information."
2,Needs Better Editing,"The information in the book is useful, and the author knows what he's talking about. The editing, however, is so poor that rereading of sections is often necessary to glean the information from them. I think the publisher did the author a terrible disservice by not providing better editing."
4,Well done Daniel!,"As an MBA student specalising in e-Business Strategy, I have read many books on the subject and have found yours to be most helpful. Coming from a management background and not a technical one, I was able to comprehend your explanations without difficult due to your simple writing style. The realistic and practical insight given is of great value. I would have preferred to see more visuals (diagrams) to reinforce and complement the text."
4,Great introduction to E-Business,"Being a beginner in E-Business, I found this book very useful. It helped me to get onto the bandwaggon and has enabled me to participate actively in e-business. My first e-business web site will be up and running soon, based on the help from the book. Thank you. I wished the were less editing errors, though."
3,Grammar nightmare,"If you're a native English-speaker this book will drive you nuts with the poor syntax and grammar. I suspect Mr. Amor is NOT a native English speaker, and I can't fault him for that, but his editors should have caught all the errors. I'm only on page 28 so far and find the verbiage tedious and repetitive. I certainly hope the information itself can overcome the distraction of trying to figure out what he's trying to say."
5,Putting business back into focus,"While most books on Internet and Business drive either into Internet technologies or Business plans, this book is able to do the crossover between Technology and Business, placing Business drivers in the foreground, just as we see it happening right now on the Internet. While technology dominated the last few years, it is now the companies with the right business plan and the right technologies how are making the most profit. While explaining all relevant Internet technologies in-depth the book never forgets the reason for the technologie by going into detail on the business value of each technology and by presenting business plans where technologies might fit or not. Especially Chapter 3 with its complete overview is excellent. Chapter 5 is an outstanding compedium for every online marketeer and Chapter 16 brings the reader into a whole new world of ideas."
2,Poor communication skills obscure message,"I bought this book because it seemed more complete than any of the other books I could find on e-commerce. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to read because of the author's poor command of English, or perhaps of writing, and the patent lack of editing in the book. I found myself getting distracted by the writer's and editor's errors. But what made the reading the hardest was the author's tendency to cram sentences together in a paragraph that did not seem to be closely related (or perhaps that he did not explicitly relate to each other). After 100 pages, I was looking for a different book to read."
5,Comprehensive Overview on all aspects of E-Business,"Finally, a book that contains all the information that I need for my work as a consultant. It enables me to speak to customers about every topic in depth without losing the general overview. Very helpful and very insightful."
4,Good overview,"The book provides a good overview on the components required for e-business. It seems to be very complete, making it easy for me to evaluate new business models and technologies. Being an IT consultant it also shows me that I should not neglect the business side."
4,Incredible source of information,"This excellent book contains all information that I need for my daily work, unfortunately it seems that the print has been rushed and some typos are still in the book, but the content makes up for the errors. Definitely a worthwile read!"
5,Impressive Overview on E-Business,"Daniel's book is very impressive. Not only does it cover all aspects of online business, it also concentrates on explaining and delivering the solution, not only bits and pieces of technology. Although he works for HP, he does include solutions from Sun, IBM and Compaq, just to name a few, which makes it a really good book."
4,Fantastic book to enlighten you on all aspects of e-business,"It is a real pleasure to read a book that confirms your own interpretations and ideas surrounding E-business. Daniel Amor, not only explains the here and now but has the sense to try and align a future strategy of E-business and how we can all benefit from this business evolution. I highly recommend that everyone reads this book (including the so called, ""non-technical people""), the digital age will affect ALL of our lives and Daniel does a very good job of showing you how and best of all, why."
2,"Complete Content, Horrible Reading","I originally bought this book because it covers everything you need to know about e-business. If you look at the table of contents, you'll find just about everything addressed. Very educational.On the other hand, the book isn't just poorly edited, I don't think it was edited at all! There is least one grammatical error, or spelling error, per page. It appears as though the book was translated into English from a foreign language. There is absolutely no excuse for this type of grammatical trash. The editor should be fired. Really.The book is really difficult to read due to the grammatical mistakes, odd use of commas and unusual way of phrasing common concepts. (Who actually translates the concept ""unsuccessful"" into the phrase ""lacking in success""?)At this price, I would wait for the next edition, and if I were the publisher, I'd get the next edition out FAST."
3,Too much,"The book is too much for me. I wanted an introduction, but this goes beyond an introduction. There are too many detailed information about each topic, which I did not want. Next time I choose a book with fewer pages to read."
1,Tough Going,"Although there is a lot of useful information in this book, the author has trouble making ANY point because of long drawn out sentences and a good deal of repetition. The blame goes almost entirely to the publisher, who should have edited the work before release. The grammar, syntax and typos make reading this a MAJOR chore. With proper editing, this book would be reduced by at least one third, and then might be worth reading."
4,great slasher film - toungue in cheek humor flick,"I loved the humor and the plot. Black comedy film with a twisted sense of tilted humor, it's due to become a cult film !!Lead actress, shan holleman, is heads above the others, in looks and acting execution.I found myself looking over my shoulder while in the woods after this one!"
1,Worst Movie....Ever,"I've seen better Mentos commercials. However, if you run it backwards, it does have some semblace of a plot."
2,TERROR FOR THE TRAILER PEOPLE,"Okay, what do you expect from a movie with this title? I went in with little expectations and was not surprised at the film's ineptness. Had it added a little more humor (even though the ping from the frying pan when the girl attacks the killer is hilarious), this movie might have been campy enough to be fun. However, it's the same old story of a group of young people (they can't be teenagers, they look too old) who ""borrow"" one of the guy's parents' RV and head off to the mountains for a camping adventure. I've often wondered why these guys do this---when they get there, all they do is sit around, drink beer, smoke pot and get laid---the same thing they do at home! Anyway, the killers identity is easy to spot and the supposedly trick ending is ridiculous. Now all we need is a slasher at an orphanage or something. Not recommended."
1,Quite possibly the worst movie of all time!,"This film may be the worst I have ever seen. Surely anyone who gives a good review, like the person above stated must have worked on the film. Many parts in the film dont seem to make sense, such as when one of the women is tied up to the back of the Rv out of nowhere. And how a person being dragged behind an Rv makes it out alive and well. None of the killings, gore, acting, or action come anywhere near close to alright. If you look at the cover of the dvd it shows a chainsaw on it, and clearly when you watch there is not a single chainsaw in it. The movie is so bad they cant even get the cover right, dont waste your time with a movie that wouldn't be able to make the b-rated category of horror films."
1,Horrible Horror Film!,"The only good reviews you will see are the people that worked on the film. I don't know how it got picked up, but the quality and the lack of acting makes this film disgusting. SAVE YOUR MONEY PLEASE! Buy a t-shirt instead."
3,Just take it for what it is,"If I can sit through ""Stupid Teenagers Must Die"", then I can sit through this movie and not feel like I want a motorhome to run me over. Granted, the acting was poor and the budget was low, but if I were 15 years old again, I can see myself and my buddies getting together on a friday night and making this a soon to be cult classic. The girls in the movie are very hot which peaks any guys curiousity and the redneck in the grocery store with that awesomely funny laugh is sure to be an impersonators dream. The one scene where the killer is chasing the brunnette down an old lane and the all you see at times is the killer chasing from behind is soooo darn funny!!! I almost fell off the sofa. The ending is a hoot when the one blonde gives her take on relationships and love as she is beating the killer with a frying pan. Again, if you have a few cents and a night just to accept this flick for what it is, then go for it !!! I have seen worse."
1,time that was NOT well wasted,one weekend i rented this movie because it was something i had never seen before so i just thought id check it out. man am i glad i didnt buy it! this is one of the stupidest movies ive ever seen. first i think the girls in the film were all porn actors and the guys were idiots. one guy acted like some bad rapper through the whole movie. the effects were stupid. the blood looked like they had poured ketchup everywhere. the weapons looked like spray painted cardboard cutouts. it was so stupid i spent alot of time laughing. the redneck at the store they stopped at was a huge laugh. definitely dont waste your money on this. now if you want something to laugh at sometime rent it for 99 cents and you will see how dumb it is
1,I had to give this movie 1 star cause there was not a lesser option!,"Are you kidding?? This ""Movie"" shames the film industry!! What a waste of time and money...oh wait, they probably didn't spend any money on this film!! These so called ""actors"" are a pathedic excuse for talent. How dare they claim this is a legitimate piece of film. The film industry is an idustry of art; This is a talentless mockery of what true film making is. I honestly hope these actors have a day job. Don't quite it people!I almost feel sorry for them, I hope they do not think this is a good movie by any stretch of the imagination! DO Not rent, see, or even waste any moment in time to watch it, it is worthless!"
1,Just a lazy effort all around,"Nobody involved in this film seemed to put forth any real attempt to make it remotely worthwhile. The acting was done by people who looked bored with the whole thing and the editing department just took a pass on this film. What is with the guy wearing the vest and tie while inside the motor home and then not wearing them outside, and then agains appearing inside and wearing the damn vest and tie again. So this guy took the time to put the tie and vest back on each time he went back into the motor home? There is just poor work ethic by everyone involved to say the least. Nobody involved in this movie will ever be seen or heard from again, not that this movies counts as a legitimate job in the entertainment industry anyway."
1,Worst Movie of the year,"Come on people, who gave this movie a good review. Does classic slasher movie mean #@%#. This movies is very, very bad. Horrible acting, terrible directing, awful cuts, predictable and the special effect were also terrible. The Writer/Director - Allen Wilbanks should really think about doing something else. You really would have to be a retard to like this movie and to be part of it as well. I mean come on a ranger tries to sword fight the slasher with his wooden leg, and the director thinks that flicking a booger is funny. I really want my money back"
1,"Truly, one of the worst of all time","$23.99 for this film..on sale? HA! I wouldn't give .02 cents for it. Motor Home Massacre has to be one of the worst films of all time; Lazy effort, uninteresting, unbelievable and horrible acting. I don't think I have ever wanted the actors in a movie to die so fast and so painfully in a film as much as this one. How could any self respecting director or producer put out this garbage??? UN BE LEAVE ABLE. From start to finish, it's plain and simply GARBAGE. Don't waste your money or time."
2,Thank goodness it was a free rental!,"In all honesty, I didn't expect too much; although I have been pleasantly surprised by some other straight to DVD horror films. I wasn't sure if it was their intention to be as cheesy and cliched as they were, but the ""acting"" on the Simple Life totally outdoes the acting here. There was little consistency; in one scene ""the nerd"" is wearing a button down dress shirt, and then when he climbs aboard the RV, he has on a sweater vest. The tagline on the back is even wrong! They didn't make a wrong turn (""wrong turn"" was a much better movie than this) they knew where they were going. Bad...simply all bad."
1,Horrible disaster of a movie,"Seriously people do NOT buy this movie. This movie is so horrible, I can't even put it into words. The acting is not even mediocre. I don't even know if to call it acting. It shouldn't be called acting it would be an insult to the real actors out there.When you read the negative reviews, please read all of them. They are absolutely telling you the truth. I'm sure you've never heard of this movie and some of the people here probably rented or bought the movie like I did based on the cover. That's all it is a scary cover, nothing more. The movie wasn't scary at all. If I could give this movie 0 stars I would."
3,Good if you are at the basic stage but not helping more...,"Bobby Owsinski's book is great for the beginners. But regarding the new elecronic era, as a professional I could not get what I wanted, especially regarding the mixing of non-standard sounds and effect processing. Because in our age the mixing business is evolving through an area where electronics is the fighting arena. That's why I give three stars, good for beginning but not for pros."
3,The Mixing Engineer's Handbook,"Okay book for learning some basic concepts. Less useful for computer-related music. I believe Bobby Owsinski has released a new edition that addresses this, but I haven't seen it.I did feel he spent too much of the book doing interviews with well known sound engineers. I would have liked to see more info on techniques and theory-classroom stuff. For me the interviews cover topics that many of us will never experience. I don't have a full-blown major studio to work in and am more interested in how to improve what I'm doing in my own modest space. After two or three of those interviews I was feeling as if I was reading the same stuff over and over again just slightly reinterpreted.I would like more in-depth discussion on mixing....The first third of the book was excellent. More of that would be good."
4,"Not definitive, but defintely worth the read","This book strikes a good balance, covering both technical and creative aspects of studio work from the mouths of industry greats. The overall format is well thought out and consistent. I have already referred back to it for ideas and I'm sure it will remain a book I enjoy reading for inspiration for years to come."
2,"Beginner beware, No detail, just a lot of ""big engineer"" talk","Beginners beware. I can see where this book may be helpful to someone who has done years of mixing as an engineer. And would like a book to remember back in the day. But as far as any practical help on mixing there is nothing here. Not one detail description of one single mix. Help me Spock! How about telling me how you would mix a guitar, hard right? Middle? Reverb? With what effects? Can you give me something I can use? Like I said, if you're an engineering pro, and would like some general ideas to try, this may be your book, but if you're a beginner like me, save yourself some cash and look at a YouTube video."
1,weak sauce,"This book is a very lame read. There will be a few paragraphs on a topic that just skim the surface/common sense aspects of the equipment, and then have 12 more paragraphs of different engineers agreeing with what was just said. If you want a real book that will teach you everything you might want to know about mixing and recording, get Total Recording by David Moulton (author of the Golden Ears listening training series).Total recording: The complete guide to audio production"
4,Simple but effective,"Even though the information presented in the book is simple and elementary, it's still a good guideline for mixing techniques and should help both beginners and professionals alike."
5,great book,"at lot of useful tricks in here, good for the beginnner to intermediate engineer. this is not about how to run a specifc piece or pieces of gear, but rather about how to use a recording studio to produce a great sounding track."
4,The Search for Intrinsic Value,"Dworkin has the right idea in given reason to believe that some things have intrinsic value because our intuitions about certain values cannot be explained with only subjective and instrumental values. However, his idea that creative process is what gives something intrinsic value seems wrong to me. The value of some of the things that Dworkin says have intrinsic value seems to be value that can be explained otherwise. Dworkin claims that the flag has intrinsic value, but its value can be explained by instrumental alone--the U.S. flag serves the purpose of representing a country. However, Dworkin's argument is interesting--the idea he has as to how to arrive at intrinsic value through unexplained intuitions is a good one."
1,not advised,"I was actually looking forward to reading this book. I came with an open mind and yet the poor writing and lack of credible arguments astounded me. How is this author a scholar and still able to write weakly biased material that is published by a major house?I would recomend not reading this book no matter what your stance is on these topics. If you agree with the author, you may be blinded by your beliefs to embrace his scewed logic, and if you disagree, you will get a bad impression of the actual arguments his side could give."
1,False Rationalizations,"Dworkin claims that accepting abortion and euthanasia is to somehow embrace the sanctity of all human life. What tripe. Whatever one thinks of these controversial issues, both involve killing as a means to problem solving. That hardly embraces life's sanctity unless language has lost all meaning."
2,MOSTLY BORING!,"I didn't get to hear Tiffany's 2nd album until 1992. I'm surprised I didn't. This album is BORING! I couldn't believe it! Follow up a multiplatinum debut from '87 with this boring set of songs from late '88? Too many bland, pointless ballads that sound like ""All This Time"" or ""Could've Been."" As I listened to the album, I dozed off to sleep during the second half. That's how dull it sounded with such flat music with too many sappy lyrics. The pressure to follow a very successful debut might have been hard. But Tiffany sounds directionless and mediocre on a lot of this album. I came off a little disappointed after hearing it."
5,Good Buy,"Found this for my grandmother, who has wanted to see ""Blossoms In The Dust"" for years now -- she is so happy! Glad this movie collection could make her day that way."
3,Not so great,"My first complaint is that ""It Happened on 5th Avenue"" was already on vol 1 and was on this vol too. Secondly, ""All Mine to Give"" (depressing) and ""Blossoms in the Dust"" weren't really Christmas movies."
2,Bizarre Movies,"These were bizarre movies. All Mine to Give was depressing and sad with not a happy ending. Blossoms...was alittle deep and depressing not really christmasy. The only redeemable movie in the bunch was ""It happened on 5th street"". It was sort of cute but I wouldn't buy the pack for that movie. I do not recommend buying this. If you are curious, rent it first. I wish I had."
4,We enjoyed what we've watched so far.,"We ordered it for the Holiday Affair; and, we've watched one other one; so far, we like it. Worth the money"
5,Great Holiday Movies,"These are some of the less played holiday movies. Great stories, family values etc. For the price they are worth checking out!"
5,4 Film Favorites: Classic Holiday Collection Vol.2,Two of these were fun to watch. Two were very sad. But it is a good collection of old fashioned movies.
3,Reprints an account of Salisbury Prison,"The heart of this book is an account by a northern prisoner, Benjamin Booth, of his time in Salisbury Prison, North Carolina. Although he was writing thirty years after the fact, time did not mellow Booth; his captors were fiends etc. To this account Steve Meyer has added some useful modern commentary; it would have been even more useful with footnotes."
3,Completely Incomprehensible Ending,"Kiss Me Deadly finds Mike Hammer confronting the Mafia over stolen narcotics. But this isn't the Mafia of the Godfather or the Sopranos. Spillane pictures them as a secret shadowy organization like the Illuminati or the Elders of Zion.The last Mickey Spillane novel in the omnibus Five Complete Mike Hammer Novels (and therefore the last Spillane novel I will ever read), starts as an improvement on the last three (which all seemed like a rehash of I, The Jury). However the ending is completely incoherent. The fate of one character that had gone missing is never dealt with. One main characters' identity is proven to be false but it's never explained who she is. Spillane is, in common with a lot of the hardboiled genre, rather sparse on description and explication, but whole plot points are ignored or left unanswered."
5,Remington ULTRASMOOTH ES-1000 Shaver,"I'll be very brief in this review, please bring this shaver backor an equivalent. I sold all three of the ES-1000 Remington shaversthat I had because I couldn't purchase replacements shavers headsanymore, except on e-bay rarely at a ridiculously high priceI'm using a Panasonic shaver now that's not as good, but adequate.Again, please bring back the Remington UlTRASMOOTH Bumb ControlShaver ES-1000 with replacement heads this was by far the bestshaver that I have ever owned in my life..."
1,BUMB,i bought this for my self because i suffer from razor bumps it did not help i still got razor bumps after using it
3,Some Major Omissions,"The stories that are included are great. However, The book misses two major works-1)The FIRST (and best) story that P'Gell appeared in2)""The Last Story"", I believe the final story in the Spirit's origional run that also included P'Gell.Also , the book is in black and white, which I belive is a disservice to the reader. To find out what a beautifully colored P'Gell story looks like, track down the Heavy Metal from the 80's that reprinted and recolored the first P'Gell story."
1,FPS is very important,"I have never used this gun before, but with 120 feet per second i know it is bad. for me and my friends 1/2 of the airsoft war is feeling when you got hit and reacting to it.we all have gun between 220 and 300 fps,and the hurt on open skin or thin clothing, but that isnt a bad thing. Plus if your pellets are moving that slowly they are bound to be inaccurate. try for something with a little more power then this gun, and if you have money to burn check out a tokyo most kick"
1,This gun sucks,This gun is terrible. It ha s pathetic accuracy and doesn't hurt from .blank. My friend is retarted the idiot bought this gun 9 times and it broke everytime. Although for the best the best gun buy the M16-A4.....................Man that gun Rocks.............................
1,this gun is suck dont buy it,"dont waste your money on this gun. it is hard to get a refund back too. i am still waiting for my refund right now but dont know if i can get it back or not. im not a picky person but i have to admit that this gun is really really SUCK, so if you want to throw your money away then buy it."
1,Not great.,Didn't work for me. Super hard to keep steady even with a tripod and pictures always turned out blurry. Wouldn't buy again.
1,Where are all the bad reviews?,"I read the two reviews on this product, both good, one of which referred to many bad reviews. My question is where are the bad reviews? Were there so many of them someone decided to remove them all and start again? Cause my experience with the lens so far as been nothing but bad. I've had no luck focusing it. Not in bright sunlight. Not on any object. Lens seems to be defective,,, it is certainly disappointing. I am going to try one more time to get a decent picture with my tripod, after that it is going back to the store and I'll put the money towards a better one."
3,This product is not really that good,I want to start off by saying that I have been using digital cameras for about 3 years now. And I have to say that this lens is slow to adjust and manipulate. I also get that chromatic abbreviation. Tends to have a purplish hue to some of my shots. While construction of the lens seems very sturdy and well built it is just too difficult to work with. It does have a 5 yr warranty so lets she what the manufacture does for me. I would not buy this lens again given the chance.
5,Excelent,I have more than a year with this mouse playing world of warcraft and still works perfectly.
3,Graphic fairy tale,This book is bit graphic for young children--a horse's head is cut off and hung on a gate post. I do read this book to my second grade class but I do a bit of my own editing as I go along. Children love fairy tales and aside from the graphic content in a couple of places this book is a good bargain.
2,Stick with the original...,"I love Guayaki's original, but I'm not a huge fan of the chai spice mate. I bought it, because I love chai and I love mate...not a great combination. Something about the sweeter kick with this one doesn't work for me. I usually drink two cups per tea bag, and the second one goes down a lot smoother. Maybe I just need to dilute the first a bit mote."
3,Chai spice is weak on spices.,"This tea is good but could use a little more zest, more spices.I would not order it again. Stop."
3,pretty good,"This was a story of a high ranking Hawaiian woman. She iscaught in conflict with her beliefs in her own and influences fromoutside cultures. This book was ok, and teaches of the Hawaiian culture"
3,It would have been better if....,"Take out the guys views on marriage and women, and the sexual language, etc. and the ending was awful, and it might have been a great read."
3,Sad,"A fictional account of the people spending the money of September 11th at breakfast in Windows of the World, and how they may have died that day. Gives youan idea of what they may have endured. So sad..."
1,Lost in translation...,"May I suggest you take the money you would have spent buying this book and donate it to your favorite charity. I was not put off by the subject matter, just by the writing. I cannot even begin to express the numerous problems with this book, there are so many in fact I wonder if Jay McInerney who writes a book jacket blurb even read it, or simply log rolled a few remarks as a thanks for getting mentioned in this bound piece of kindling."
4,"Daring, but far from perfect","Don't be offended at the author's graphic details (many of which were left out of the English version). The premise is clearly stated and the idea of the two speakers (one in the WOTW and one visiting the US several years later to write about the WOTW)alternating memories does work.While the author too often drifts into his personal artistic and political tastes, the scenes between Carthew and his children are often moving. The very fact he makes us think, ""What would we do?"" is worth the read. I would have liked greater attention in the description of the WTC, but the author chose to use the book as a metaphor of everything from religion to the future of the world. Regardless, the writing is creative and the book is a fast read. For those of us in the New York metropolitan area, we still look toward lower Manhattan say, ""something's missing""."
3,Didn't meet the hype...,"For the money I spent on this I was disappointed. ""Sleeping Awake"" is a good song, not great (catchy hook phrase), the video is better but not great either. Too dark. I didn't appreciate having Unloco's ""Bruises"" added to this P.O.D. 'single'. I didn't order secular metal music but got it anyway. Team Sheep's ""Passportal"" is a good instrumental, obviously done for the movie, but well done. Seems to me that P.O.D. continues to go down the road of commercial/crossover sucess. That's a shame! They need to return to their first love!"
5,"An essential gem, pick it up if you find one.","The Stiff Records Box Set is one of those ""best I ever bought"" type things. With an average of 24 songs per cd, it was a terrific value, and I figure the only thing better would be to actually own the albums from which the songs came. Sure, the quality of selections is kind of scattered. And I do have the songs on album of some of the artists, so although they may be the best cuts of the collection, they don't hold much value for me. But the rest is terrific. For anyone who first got into music in the late seventies, (and didn't like Journey and the Bee Gees), it's like the best indie radio program ever. An all-time great."
5,If it ain't Stiff... but you've heard this one before...,"VERY fine collection - the only real complaint I have is the audio itself. The levels are really low (""Whole Wide World"" is just this side of inaudible) and some of the sourced audio is mushy (""Mercury Poisoning"" sounds like an okay-sounding boot).On the other hand, the song selection is spectacular and the liner notes are a fun bit of propaganda."
1,Poor package without protective materials,"The package has very little room (1 inch) for protection and virtually no protective materials particularly for the corners. Naturally, it had many (about 10-15) dents and scratches on the corners. I tried as this seems to be a good value but I have to say that it would be surprising if anyone got a perfect (no dents) one. Bottom line - no one likes chores of repackaging and returning the product. If you do not mind dents and scratches, this might be a great value product. Otherwise, forget it."
3,My opinion,"I bought this for a friend, and as others stated it arrived dented, just in original packaging is the reason why..I called Amazon and explained that it could go one of 2 ways, I could send it back and play until I got a good one, not dented or they could offer me a discount and I'd keep this one seeing that it works good, they offered me a 20% discount so I kept it.Now unless it fails to freeze which it has been fine so far. Amazon was great about this.."
1,"Had 2 sent, packaging is awful. No protection at all.","Had 2 sent, packaging is awful. No protection whatsoever! both damaged with dents and scratches."
2,Poor quality: packaging and construction,"When I made the decision to purchase this freezer there were only two reviews: one good, one poor. I assumed the poor review was more about poor expectations but was proven incorrect. Product arrived on time but external box portended further issues; as others have indicated the packaging is insufficient but that's only part of the story. The construction of the freezer is of very lightweight material, certainly sufficient operational but little hope of it arriving intact. Mine had to go back because one leveling foot would not function, it had been dropped hard enough on the corner to destroy it's function.I really wanted to like this freezer for price/value and convenience of delivery but was disappointed, it was returned and I purchased my original Frigidaire decision locally for same price. Kudos to Amazon for making the return process very easy."
4,Works Great...but more care needed in shipping,We have used this for almost a year now. Works like a charm. Would have been 5 stars if it did not have a nice dent on the front corner of the unit. I think this has been noted in other reviews. Why can't they figure out how to ship this thing with a litte more care?
4,No Problems,"Product received as described. Working great. No damages upon delivery. Good size for my needs, and light weight. And a good price!"
1,Don't bother,"I read the reviews about this freezer being damaged, but I thought I'd try it anyhow just to see if I had better luck. I received one and returned it, then received a second and it was just as damaged as the first. Amazon handled it fine and I didn't end up wasting any money or anything, but I find it very strange that they can sell damaged goods like this. They offered a discount but it wasn't worth it to us still. We went down to a local Bernie's and picked one up for only a little more and it was in perfect condition."
1,product damaged on delivery,"I WAS NOT PLEASED AT ALL WITH THE DELIVERY OF THE PURCHASED PRODUCT! I NEVER EVEN USED THE NEW FREEZER DUE TO THE FACT THAT WHEN I OPENED THE CARTON IT CAME IN, AFTER IT WAS DELIVERED BY UPS, I FOUND THE ITEM DAMAGED/DENTED IN SEVERAL PLACES. THIS WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND I CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR A REPLACEMENT AND WHEN THE REPLACEMENT ITEM WAS DELIVERED IT WAS DAMAGED WORSE THEN THE FIRST ONE! EVEN THE UPS DRIVER SAID THAT BY LOOKING AT THE SHIPPING CARTON ON THE SECOND ONE, HE COULD TELL IT WAS GOING TO BE DAMAGED AND IT WAS! SHOULD I BE REVIEWING THE FREEZERS BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CONDITION OF ITEMS ON DELIVERY?..... MAYBE/MAYBE NOT... BUT DELIVERY IS PART OF THE DEAL OF THE PURCHASE SO THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT A LOW REVIEW. FUTURE BUYER'S BEWARE... UPS DELIVERY ON THIS ITEM SUCKED!"
4,great,"i bought this freezer years ago when it was much cheaper, im sooooooooooo glad, this freezer rocks and is very useful for when i buy in bulk. had a few dings on it, but i was still pleased!"
2,lousy service,"my haier freezer was shipped without an internal drain plug. haier customer service refused to send me the missing drain plug until I provided proof of purchase, which I did not receive with the freezer, and have not been able to get from Amazon.. It has been over a month now and all Ive gotten is the run-around instead of the plug!C an someone help me ? Otherwise, freezer is working well-- only defect is minor finish defect on freezer corner------AND THE MISSING INTERNAL DRAIN PLUG ! Call 843-524-7764 if you can help !"
3,"Yep, I bought it.","When I first bought this CD Amazon did not have preview tracks for it like it does now, so I was a little dissapointed when I got the CD. Like you probably noticed, the only vocal tracks on this CD are Soramimi Cake and Raspberry Heaven. Good songs, no doubt, but my favorites weren't included, like Moi Moi or Lazy Crazy Bonkurazu. Instead, the CD includes a majority of BGM. While it's amusing during the show, the harsh overly used recorder wears on the ears after a while. Soramimi and Raspberry make the CD a worthy purchase, but the other 36 tracks get old fast. Hopefully volume 2 will include the vocal pieces I crave, till then unless you're really devoted to Azumanga, steer clear."
5,A superb CD; one of my favorites!,"This was my first anime soundtrack CD, and it's one of the best in my extensive collection. The music is a combination of pop-esque songs, mellow songs which were used as background music, and two songs with English translation. The pop-ish songs are, in my opinion, the best of the CD. The English tracks are the ones I stay away from. The Japanese lyrics give the songs a better sound than the English words. All the pop-like songs have some bounce to them, and are great traveling music. Just pop it in and have a good trip. It makes mediocre study music, though, unless you turn the volume down, then it's average. Overall, this CD is very good. The second one, ""Illusion,"" also has good music. However, this one is by far the better of the duo. It has more pop-esque songs on it. My favorite tracks are 2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 14. The rest are okay, but the previous set of tracks make this CD."
5,An Absolutely Magnificent Soundtrack!!!,"This is a magnificent soundtrack for ""El Hazard --the Magnificent World."" The mood of the soundtrack blends perfectly with that of the series. I just love the Arabian/Persian flavor in many of the songs. I especially enjoyed the melancholy ""Ifurita's Theme"" which is very beautiful (;_;). This is a must-have for all fans of Japanese animation, and people who like adventures!!! Along with this CD, you should also get the Wanderers ""Illusion"" Soundtrack, which is just as good as this one, or maybe even better."
1,Wazbones,I disagree with the above review.Dont waste your hard earned cash on this as its Tigertailz at their very worst.I was so excited when it came out but alas the excitment turned to disapointment when I finally heard it.If ya want decent Tailz stuff get Bezerk or young and Crazy
5,This book was great.,"At first I thought this book was really short. But when I read itI was moved by what c. j. wilkes had to say. Her young life was full of so much trauma, it was really sad. But the way she overcame and grew from her experience was amazing. I was really touched by her ability to forgive her father for the horrible acts he committed. This book gave me new perspective and insight into family situations gone bad, that I could not have fathomed before.I just want to say, thanks to c.j wilkes for being a strong enough woman to share this wonderful book with the world."
1,I didn't care for it,It seemed a bit far fetched and I really can't recommend it. The use of grammar was also questionable.
3,Pre-schoolers did not enjoy,Was kind of a waste of money for 4 and 5 year olds. I think an older child would find more interesting.
2,Disappointing,I LOVE Wallace and Gromit but found this book to be just too fluffy. It wasn't droll enough and definitely not substansive. Perhaps I was hoping for too much?
5,Excellent read and rich characters!,"""Charlie, they took my thumb!!!"" Patrick has made an art form out of the lives of street hoods in NYC, circa 1979. Loaded with truisms about life and loss, this book presents rich characters worthy of great cinema (it was turned into a great film of the same title with an amazing Eric Roberts and Mickey Rourke starring). A great read!"
3,an ok book but hard to read,"hey...i bought this book a couple years ago mainly cuz i wanted to read the book version of the movie, and i found as i skimmed it it started matching up mostly. the beginning tho was VERY hard to follow and just a bit ...tense if you will. i had no clue the book was done in the 70s lol. i will still keep this around and try to read it again some other time tho..or maybe give it to a friend. thanks"
4,Well Done Freehold Boys,"Overall a great CD. Many years ago a bunch of us spent a lot of time on the NJ Turnpike going to see these guys. We'd like to see them again. The band had a great sense of humor. The guitar player, Stanley Steele had a great stage presence and the drummer, Bucky was a lot of fun. The CD is good classic '80s rock. ""Desiree"" is a great classic rock song and ""Someway Somehow"" is a more mature ballad. ""Momma Lao"" is a nice song to sway to. The remake of ""What do all the people know"" is weaker than their live rendition was. I recommend you give it a listen and try to track down these jersey boys for a live show!"
4,Highly Recommend,"I happened to stumble across this film completely by chance through a series of Tweets and I am so happy that I did.Like a lot of indie films it leaves you with something to think about afterwards which I love about it but as a general whole I think this films causes you to really think, it's well scripted, well put together and if you like dark dramas that you pretty much won't find anywhere else I would highly recommend this film.NoRestrictions seems to make a lot of thought provoking films and I love this!"
3,not bad,"first let me start by saying that i like veloso pretty well. he's no gilberto gil or jorge ben in my opinion but he's hugely influential and creative. he also has widely eclectic interests.on this cd, we find veloso sticking to rock with few forays into other genres. other reviewers found this album highly original, but at many points i was reminded of some of his 70s releases at the very least in terms of atmosphere. the lyrics are in portuguese and veloso's voice sounds the same as ever. overall, i felt the album to be dark, complex, and at times reminiscent of the indie-rock scene. it wasn't to my tastes. however there were a few songs that i liked -- deusa urbana e um sonho in particular.it's a major departure from his recent work. i'm not a fan of much of his recent work and neither am i a fan of this cd. but if you're a huge veloso fan it's worth a listen to decide for yourself."
4,Another great album!,Ce is another great album by Caetano Veloso. His compositions are still strong and his voice getting better and better. Highly recommended album.
3,"Not ""A Foreign Sound"" or ""Fina Estampa""","Very good Caetano music, but not in the category of his two previous ones, both of which are five-star-plus."
3,No Video???,"First gripe.....there was supposed to be a video the for single attached to this. The single (TIOBI) is probably the best song on their latest studio album, however, the two b-sides are dull. Liam's song is the better of the two. The over-production of the song saves it, since it sounds like Liam uses the same chord throughout the entire song."
4,Rachel and leah,Wonderful story telling. I could barely put it down. Until the ending where it seems as though he has stumped his toe and just said....WELL THIS BOOK IS DONE!
5,Captivating and inspiring,"I have loved every one of the Women of Genesis novels. The Biblical characters come alive for me as if Mr. Card were their ""Speaker for the Dead."" Whether or not he is right in all of his surmises, he captures so many truths about human nature (and the divine), and does it so sympathetically and lovingly, and with such breathtaking literary beauty. I find myself in tears, there is so much truth to ponder."
1,Very disappointing,"Just once, I would like to encounter a fair and balanced view of the story of Jacob and his consorts.In The Red Tent, the blame for all wrongdoing landed solely on the men.In this book, the pendulum has swung, and now it's the ladies' turn.I rarely complain about sexism in books, but this is to be one of those times. How is it possible that both Jacob and Laban could be completely blameless in every hardship that befalls the family, with the blame resting instead on their nasty, insubordinate female chattel? It's just not possible.This book left me fuming in rage and longing to confront the author and the wholly virtuous Biblical-male counterparts he has imagined."
3,not fully satisfied,I was unable to download from the disc so I was emailed a link from their site but it was not the complete product I bought.
5,Best teasing comb ever,"This comb has been my favorite since the late 1960s when it was sold only in beauty supply stores and was the ""Ace #9 Teasing Comb"". As a hairstylist, I loved it from the first time I picked it up and even though my profession changed, I have continued to use it through all of the years since. Now it is Goody Ace #62206 but is more or less the same - squared end instead of rounded but things change! I don't understand why I can't find such a good product in local stores anymore and have to order online. This is the only comb for me - simply a must have. Glad someone still sells it."
1,Unreliable seller: loveotc,"I'm not sure this review belongs in this area, but I see no option of leaving packaging feedback or seller feedback for loveotc. And I hope to warn other Amazon buyers. My comb arrived super late, and when it arrived, it was the wrong item. It was a cheap plastic comb (not the Ace Tail Comb, not even a tail comb lol). I attempted to contact the seller with no response, and also took a peek at their feedback and noticed that they often scam buyers. I should've checked that out first, oh well. I opened a claim with Amazon and hopefully will be able to return the item and get a refund."
1,Ace Teasing Tail Comb,I was expecting the Lady Ace that was made of rubber. The comb I received was a cheap plastic.
5,Great Comb,"This is a must have comb. Used to have them in all of the drug stores. Now - for some reason I cannot find them. For fine or thinning hair - this comb works wonders for a little backcombing. Glad I could find it on Amazon after visiting the big 3 drug stores, Target and a few beauty stores."
5,Comb,I love this style comb and have used this style for many years. I was so glad to see I could still buy it.
2,Gag gift,"This was bought as a gag gift and it served it's purpose for getting a laugh, but when the movie was actually viewed, the picture quality was awful and the movie is just plain bad. Oh well, I guess thats why you can't find this movie on DVD."
5,good,"Product Features12-band radar/laser detector with UltraBright data display and city and highway modesMonitors X, K, Ka Superwide, and Ku radar bands; 360-degree laser detectionProtects driver from VG2 and Spectre 1 scanning technologies; digital signal strength meterSafety Alert and Strobe Alert functions notify drivers when emergency vehicles are nearbyIncludes mounting bracket; measures 2.7 x 1.3 x 4.4 inches (W x H x D); 1-year warranty"
5,"Works great - but also keeps me alert, focused on maintaining speed",I tried few other fancy ones with color display etc but you really don't need all that. This works well and settings are just enough. Beeps help remind to drive safe and maintain speed vs accidently going over. Strobe alerts works very well as well indicating emergency vehicles and beeps in construction zone altering.
3,"It's good, but....","This device works great in small towns, but it has one small problem. It does not detect whatever the Houston police are using. Okay, not such a small problem after all."
1,Poor Range,"very Poor range, it'll detect a signal as close as 10 meters which was very disappointing for me."
3,The buy is ok,"The detector works, i don't feel it works all the time, for example one time i was driving to class and there was this cop with someone pulled over and the emergency signled on the detector started to sound, fine thats good, but however sometime later there was this cop car with its signal on and the detector didn't go off until after the cop passed me. not good. The way i feel it works is intermittenly, on the highway in highway mode it rocks, but in the city on city mode its hard to say what it might, or might not do."
4,Great product for a great price,"I have been using the cobra radar detector now for 3 weeks, its right on except for false alarms, I would recommend this product."
2,COBRA,I am not sure if I am happy with this detecter. When I first ordered this I was sent the wrong thing. Amazon did a great job getting me what I ordered right away. But the product Yeha not too sure about. As of today no I am not happy.
5,Cobra,I am very pleased with the Cobra radar detector it performs as represented and the price was excellent.
4,College Student City and Highway Driver,"I am a college student that takes both city streets and the highway back and forth from school, work, and my home. All the features on this radar work great. The 360 degree protection is convenient so that you are aware of speed traps on the return trip. It detects speed traps with ample time for you to slow down and avoid a ticket. The reason I did not give this radar a five star rating was because of the limited range it had on radar guns. I have been to close for comfort when the detector when off. Clearly officers have seen me hit the brakes pretty hard when they had their radar guns on. But I still have avoided many tickets with this detector and it was a great deal for the amount of money I paid. Also make sure to set your own settings because the factory settings were to basic. Overall this is a great radar detector."
1,Poor detection. Do not buy.,"I bought this product from Amazon about a month ago. I would not recommend this after my experience. I passed by several cop cars on the highway that clearly had radar turned on and the cobra did not alert me. Initially I thought the cop cars did not turn on their radar. However, I passed several electronic speed displays that are setup in neighbourhoods and highways that display speed based on a radar. I saw my speed displayed on the sign but this detector did not go off.I have a Whistler in my other car and that works very well."
3,Great for the price!!,"Pretty good detector for the price, i wish the radius was a little better, but i wouldn't live or die by this detector far as speed is concerned, you should still do the speed limit or not go over too much, but it is great far as letting you know when cops have thier radar gun on, which is my primary concern anyway. It really depends on how much over the speed limit you normally go over, if you normally go over 5-7 mph over this is perfect, espicially for the price, if you normally go over 8 mph on up, you may want to get a more advanced detector, in my opinion it depends on how you drive.Corey aka Cool C"
1,Absolute Junk. I've been thru two and neither lasted longer than six months.,These are not bad detectors but they just don't hold up. The first one I had gave out after about six months and was replaced under warranty. The second worked about the same length of time and it gave out too. So much for spending a little bit more for something that will last. I'll not buy any more Cobras.
4,low in price compared to a speeding ticket,very good unit for the price. i have used it for over a 16 months and liked it so much i purchased a 2nd one for my third vehicle. i used it primaraly in the city an it has some false alerts but its very good for the money you spend on it.
5,Upbeat Christmas music,"One of my merchant friends had this available in her shop. The album has a total of 14 tracks of Christmas music, all instrumental. I have it on now while I work at my PC. It makes good background music for PC work, wrapping gifts, etc. As noted on the cover it is jazz, swing, and retro style music. You can turn the volume up, or turn it down. Playing time is 51:42. It is easy listening."
3,I didn't learn much...,"I recieved this book when I took the Red Cross Babysitting course and wasn't very impressed. I knew almost everything in there (because of common sense). There were a few things that I did learn, like what to do in specific emergency situations, but that's about it. Safety is a number one priority for me and, hopefully, all babysitters, but this just went overboard. Plus, I believe some of the information was inaccurrate and could actually put a child in danger. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for an experienced babysitter and only certain sections to brand new, young babysitters."
3,"Smells good, but doesn't last long","It doesn't last very long. It smells okay for about 2 hours tops then it just fads away and it like you never put it on. So I guess it kinda useless in that regard. I dont like cologne, it too strong, so I use aftersave because it more subtle. But it still has to last. This one doesn't"
1,This should be classified as a comedy!,I have never written a review in my life but this one motivated me to do it! One of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen. I missed parts of the movie because I was laughing so hard at the inconsistencies.
5,Better than I thought it would be,"All three books in this series, Character, Setting and Plot, are way better than I thought they would be. The graphics initially turned me off, but when I read the one page ideas, I was able to get past the art work. The pages are easy to read, so you can copy and give to students. Plot has easy ideas for book reports, and character development too. The book on Character has several ideas that can be used while reading books. Of the three, I think Plot is my favorite, but all have excellent ideas."
3,Warning! The Item pictured is not what you receive!,"I have owned these headphones for 4 years & love them. Unfortunately, one ear stopped working, so I was thrilled to still find the same headphones on Amazon all these years later.When I opened the box, I was very disappointed to find that the headphones sent to me are NOT the same. They have the same model number, but apparently the company changed the headphones. The new ones I got did not fit as nicely & felt weird on/in my ears."
4,"for smaller ears, these work great","I'm on my second pair of these retractable ear buds. I have small ears so the normal ear-wrap ear buds don't fit and usually hurt. These fit great. Plus I really like the re-tractability. I use these primarily at the gym. My first pair lasted much longer - almost two years before the sound gave out in one. I've had this second pair since April. They are still in use, but the earbud part is not solidly connected to the ear wrap. For less than $15, you do get what you pay for. However, I have yet to find a comparable item that FITS inside my ear without hurting."
1,"great idea, poor quality/execution",I have been looking for a pair of wrap-around earphones with a retractable cord for a while now. I prefer theseSony MDR-J10 h.ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design (Black)earphones usually but since I travel a lot I wanted something that wouldn't tangle and was easy to carry. Unfortunately these are not the solution. They are poorly made and very uncomfortable. A piece on the ear part came off shortly after taking the earphones out of the package. I would not recommend these to anyone. Hopefully someone will come up with a quality solution soon.
1,Threw them out,"Did anyone actually TRY these before they put them out on the market? They don't even fit in your ear and are not adjustable so the bud just hangs there. And even if you could get them to fit, the sound quality is terrible. I threw them out the first time I wore them. Not worth half the cheap rice."
1,Broken after using once!,First the wrap around ear piece broke off of one ear after wearing once and now I see the other ear has had the wires detached from the front part! Trash! Don't waste your money!
2,No different than Retrak/Emerge ETAUDIOWRP Retractable Ear-Wrap Stereo Earphones,The only difference between this and Retrak/Emerge ETAUDIOWRP Retractable Ear-Wrap Stereo Earphones is the color of the plastic. And the the Retrak/Emerge ETAUDIOWRP Retractable Ear-Wrap Stereo Earphones is only $8.99!
2,this toy is not at all as i expected it to be,"i saw this on tv and i thought it was going to be the best and when i got it for christmas, i put the batteries in and played it. at first i thought it was as clear as a tv, but i was compoletely wrong. I thought they were ok and my cousin saw it and said it looked like a moasaic picture. as i watched more, i realized she was right. my mom paid 6o bucks for it and now i gave it to my brother and its just lying on his bed. i thought this was going to be alot better."
4,Peskin's Hidden Story of Cancer,"This was a good read, enough science and support material. Enough references to get a thorough understanding of the subject. Most of his research came from the reference library, and in his words, ""He stand on the shoulders"" of those before him."
2,oh boy,"I don't dispute what the author wants to say- I have eaten a paleo diet for years and it has reversed many problems I had, so my review is not a review of the views expressed in this book. But it's a hard read: it badly needs editing, it's so poorly written that it makes you wonder how the author managed to read through complicated scientific research and not pick up an idea on how to write a sentence. If you want to learn more about this, I'd suggest books like The Paleo Solution by Robb Wolf. It's not specifically about cancer, but it talks about the same kind of diet, in a fun, easy-to -read way, without the repetitions that make it impossible to read the hidden story of cancer."
5,The Hidden Story of Cancer,"The book The Hidden Story of Cancer has some extremely important information that people need to know about cancer. I appreciated the science and history it contained, the easy reading format, and the protocol treatment for tackling and prevention of cancer. Thank you. MP"
1,Eat Meat: It Can Never Fail,"I am very concerned that this author's suggestion for curing cancer is to eat more meat. He also goes on to say in his diet section that eating a lot of meat can't cause anything bad to happen because that's not how the body works. He says that if something benefits one system in one quantity, it cannot damage another in any quantity, and that anyone who thinks otherwise should re-evaluate their logic. It is unbelievable to me that anyone could possibly believe eating an excessive amount of meat will do anything related to lifestyle diseases other than increase their likelihood and severity.I hope no one gets hurt stuffing themselves with meat to cure their cancer!"
4,Rare Glimpse,"Binebine's book offers one a rare glimpse into the world of the illegal immigrate. This book humanizes the need to immigrate to a better life and points out the randomness of our cultural birth place. The backgroud of each of the migrating characters is revealed and with that reveal you will bond with them and cheer for their survival. I recommend this book, it will move you, it will make you think and the characters will resinated within you long after you finished reading the book."
3,Not His Best,"The title is lovely, and completely inappropriate. ""Paranoid Ramblings of a Once-Great Philosopher"" would be more accurate. Some of the chapters are nice (particularly the one on nature) but overall, this is quite certainly not Rousseau's best book. Try the ""Confessions"" first."
5,A Modern Social History of Tokyo,"Compared to ""High City, Low City"", this book is not nearly as enjoyable, only because the post-war history of the city is slightly less enjoyable to read.My only gripe with the book is that Sidensticker has an annoying tendency to translate some place names into English. They would be better left in Japanese romanization.The book is beginning to show it's age, but it is a tall order to keep up with changes in Tokyo.I would suggest reading Peter Poham's ""Tokyo: The City at the End of the World"" as a companion volume to what Seidensticker writes of.Both are great books, but Seidensticker concentates on the people and events that shaped the post war history of the city. Popham's strength is in the architecture and town planning of the city.It's a very enjoyable read, though : think of it as a biography."
2,Tokyo Out of Focus,"I read a great deal of history and have seldom found a book less coherent. The author doesn't seem able to stay with a consistent theme other than in the most general way. His prose wonders aimlessly through chapters, even losing itself sometimes within a single sentence. His announced intentions for the book are intriguing, but the execution is deflating."
3,Positives & Negatives,"This is an excellent product for very specific foaming tasks, but has its drawbacks for others. The foam gives off no hazardous fumes and it is easy to clean up for use later on. It also will not place pressure on surrounding surfaces that could cause ""bulging"". The foam does not ""harden"" as poly foam does. It remains flexible, even when fully cured. It creates an ""open cell"" sealant which does not provide as much insulation value as with ""closed-cell"" poly foam, but any foam insulation is better than none at all. Soap & water clean-up is much easier, cheaper and far less hazardous than the Acetone required of poly foam. These foam-in-a-can products are very costly on a per-can basis. If you have a great deal of foaming to do, there are better alternatives; however, they are OK for occasional small foaming tasks."
2,"Not very good so called ""Cowboy type of guyz.""","I thought I would try out and see how these great men came to live in a nation so one sided. The actors do or seem not to put their soul into it. It does not matter if it is a B-cut movie or a major class movie, i am sure there could of been better actors who can really show the love and detail in playing a roll to make the movie more Life Like in the real world. over all 1 to 10, 10 being the est and 1 the worst, I have to give it a 4.8.....Just cause it is not something i would just stick in for a movie, I am gong to keep the movie in my collection of westerns i have already been building for over a decade. thanks al'"
1,Book does not match title,"This book would be good if the title was ""How to start an at-home business."" But, as far as having anything to do with working at home with children, there is very little. The little it does have is basic parenting skills. From the title I expected the book to have tips about how to handle the children while working at home. It did not. The word ""working"" in the title is a present tense word meaning that you are currently at work in your home. This books gives instructions on how to begin to work at home. I am very disappointed and feel completely mislead by the title. I did not gain one thing from reading this book."
1,This book is awful,"As someone who is intimately familiar with the Vineyard, I can't begin to describe how superficial, idiotic, and just plain awful this book is. In addition to being poorly written and uninformed, it reads as if the author just wanted to make some money and thought this would be a good way to do it. If you really want to learn about the vineyard, read the MV Times (MVTimes.com)"
5,Anyone who lives in a tourist destination should read this.,"I found this book as amusing as it was enlightening. The author suceeds beautifully in capturing the dilemnas, discussions and dreams of the Vineyard which are so familiar to our midwest peninsula. The local observations captured in the book are the exact words you would hear in any one of our coffee shops. Anyone who is considering moving to their favorite vacation spot should read this book first."
1,A bad book,"The problem with this book is not that it says bad things about the Vineyard - there are certainly bad things to be said, as well as good. It's that both the bad things and the good things are off. The book reads like the author had never been there, and in fact, it appears that her time there seems to have been merely a few short trips.So as a book purporting to be about a place, it's about as useful as any other book about a place which the author clearly doesn't know. Any tourist to the Vineyard could have written as good, which is to say as bad, a book. Frankly, any tourist to anywhere could have written this, as long as they were armed with a vineyard map.Hopefully someone will one day write the book this could have been. For now, this belongs in the fiction category, in my opinion."
4,next best thing to being there,"I really enjoyed this book. I needed a vacation, but couldn't take one - so this book transported me to the island of Martha's Vineyard for the week. I had always thought year-round island living would be ideal, but the author shows both the wonders and the downside of such a closed society."
4,Staying Power,I been taken it about an hour before I do it and it works big time. I last way longer than I ever have and the feeling is mind blowing. Potent stuff!
