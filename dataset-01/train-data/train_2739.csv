3,"Both have secrets, just different kinds.","Clemma is a young widow with secrets she dares tell no man. Filling her time as a lonely, conservative Christian widow with companions of water colors and flowers, she happens to meet the mysterious and ""hated"" Dr. Paul Blaine. His unethical practices have made him a village outcast but his need for citrus fruit in winter has driven him to the conservatory where Clemma paints.This is a light romance set in England and keeps a reader in suspense, even though the plot is a little syrupy and somewhat predictable."
5,Nice quality doll house furniture,"Got this to go with Hape/Educo all seasons doll house, fits perfect and fits well with the Hape / Educo doll family."
3,"Bottom 10 in June, corn be heavy soon.","If we were to rank all living Nobel Laureates, ten percent of them would be ""Bottom 10."" What would we do to punish those losers?"
1,Forced Reading,"Forced Ranking, which was forced reading from my Company's VP, was perhaps the poorest example of published material I have had the displeasure to read. My Calculus textbooks had more substance. How Dick Grote could take 10 pages of material and repeat himself enough to make it last over 100 pages is the only amazing thing about this book."
5,Great story,"Powerful documentary about a unique individual. Bob Benjamin presents an inspiring model for anyone who wants to excel in the face of adversity. He has touched the lives of many, many people."
1,"Warning, these leak","I used RayOVac batteries for quite a while but lately I've had problems. For those batteries date-coded Dec 2017, they leak after just a month or so. In fact, in my back-up stash (just refreshed for the winter) batteries, new and still factory sealed, purchased at a reputable store less than one month ago, were leaking in the package. I can't talk about life-span... I went though all my equipment and all but one of these batteries were leaking. Got rid of them all. I hope they improve in the future and I'll try them again."
1,The worst batteries I had i my life,"Leaked in the factory package without any use after couple of years of storage in air conditioned room, supposed to work for another 3 years. Never will buy any products from this company."
2,Alkaline D cells last longer than Rayovac D cell,"Until I bought several weeks worth of Rayovac Alkaline D cells, I used Duracell Alkaline D cells.Every week I run a 3-CD changer (JVC _CX-XC370) for 11 hours worth of water aerobic classes, at the same volume level (Volume #10), from Tuesday to Thursday. The Duracells lasted all 11 hours (and might last even longer). In contrast, these Rayovac D cells for the last five weeks have consistently died during the second half of the next-to-last class (after hour 9.5 and before hour 10)."
3,Shelf life questionable,"I bought several dozen of these batteries and stored them in a closet as a backup supply. According to Ray-O-Vac ads these batteries are guaranteed fresh for seven years in storage. After a bit over two years I went to get some only to find every one of them had leaked out. Luckily they were in plastic packages and did not damage the closet. My initial revue of these batteries was one star. I changed it to three stars because after discovering the leaky batteries, I contacted Ray-O-Vac and they sent me a shipping label for return of the defective batteries and then sent me new fresh replacements. Although it did take some time, they were very courteous and di back up their product. The batteries work fine, but my advice is to check your battery powered electronics often to make sure they don't get damaged by possible leaking batteries."
5,Thank you Dr. Garnett,"Thank you, Dr. Garnett, for your many years of research, and for writing this magical account of those years. This book provides insight into cancer from the perspective of a researcher, rather than from the perspective of a doctor or patient - a perspective that offers a new vision of the disease. As a cancer survivor who has used the product created by Dr. Garnett, I believe it is well worth the time to read this book for anyone who has been touched by cancer."
1,bringing forth the man,This is a management consultant approach to child rearing-in just 15 minutes a day you can enisure your son'edestiny...I had difficulty getting through this. It's a collection of random observations form the author's personal experience that are not intergrated into a cohesive text. I found him rambling and going off on tangents. Could not relate to or apply most of this. There are better books out there on this subject that reflect a better undersatndiong of teenage boys. Would not recommedn this to nayone.
1,Disappointed,I felt this book had nothing to do with single mothers raising teenage boys. There were many chapters on quotations that had nothing to do with single motherhood or children. I could not get through this book as after a number of chapters I still could not find something about raising a teenage boy on my own or how to handle different situations with him and his piers. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
4,Helpful for people learning Hebrew script,"After looking at some of my homework exercises, my boyfriend's mother subtly suggested I purchase these notebooks. The spacing of the lines is not uniform, thus they are a little confusing to use at first--should I write in the wider of the spaces, or the narrower? But, after a few months' use, I appreciate that both are options. I started off in the larger spaces, and then transitioned to the narrower once I had improved my control of the letters. I do wish the sheets were perforated for easy detachment, but that's my only real complaint."
2,The Math Experience,"When I previewed the book on-line, it looked ""great"" like the title indicates. When I got the book, I was disappointed. There is very little that I can use in the classroom. I don't see any of the activities really capturing the interest of my students."
1,Not to great,I did not find this book at all useful. I work with students struggling in math and found Marilyn Burns to be much more helpful.
2,Not Good,"This was very disappointing. I've read 2 other books by Morgenstern which I loved and thought they were genious...""Book of Coupons"" and ""Secret Letters 0 to 10"" After reading both of those books I felt I must read everything she's published. Alot of nothing happened in this book. The writing was decent however the story line was lost. This had potential but Morgenstern definetley dropped the ball on this one. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Don't get fooled by the title!!,"I purchased this video thinking it was just monster trucks but I was surely disappointed. About half the video is so but the other half is tractor pulls, demolitions, motorcycles, and mudders. Not only that but at least one third of the action is not bloopers at all. It should have been titled ''Bloopers And Action In Motorsports''so the buyer isn't mislead (or should I say suckered) into buying this terrible video. My recommendation would be the ''Monster Truck Mania'' series instead."
1,Very Silly Book with Zero Appeal,"A little girl named Daisy wakes up one day to discover she has, for no real explained reason, turned into a chicken. Her parents do no seem at all shocked when their daughter the chicken clucks into the kitchen for breakfast. She turns down her usual egg in favor of picking at some corn flakes. She goes out to the bus only to be refused admittance. The story goes on from here.There are so many delightful easy to read books being developed for beginning readers. There are books that do not talk down to beginning readers. These stories have real plot lines and tell a story. This is not one of those delightful books. Any book needs to explain the why and how. The reader is never told how or why Daisy woke up as a chicken; or why she turned back into a little girl that evening. I am willing to suspend all belief if the story is good and the writer allows me to do that."
1,BUY A DIFFERENT BOOK,"COnsidering the breadth of the book, one should expect a lot, However, the book fails the reader when it deals with specifics. While it does a good job of identifying key concerns in the future of american business, the prescription side of the arguments brusquely treats the issues and broadbrushes just about everything. It would be better to invest in another, better book on this well researched subject. The bibliography does give a good hint of where to start."
4,Nous homme Hubert,"""OSS 117: Cairo, Nest Of Spies""----------------------------------------A blithe, brilliant French satire of Sean Connery/Roger More-era James Bond films. Comic actor Jean Dujardin grinningly portrays 1950's secret agent Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath, a grinning colonial chauvinist utterly incapable of self-reflection or insight, who swaggers and postures his way through the Suez Canal crisis, waving the banner of France as best he knows how. Bond fans with a sense of humor will delight in this film's spot-on recreation and skewering of the stylistic cliches of those films. Although the humor becomes fairly repetitive and single-note towards the end, this is still a very funny, very fun movie. Definitely recommended! (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)"
2,Not particularly funny,"Ponderous and predictable. My French isn't good enough to follow the dialogue. Perhaps it loses something in translation? It reminded me that the French once adored Jerry Lewis, long after US audiences had tired of him. Perhaps I'm missing a receptor for this kind of humor?"
2,Not very funny,"As a fan of French comedy, I got the film based on the reviews. What most of the reviewers state is true, except that the film is not all that funny. The premisses and situations are comedy gold, but the execution is not funny. I think reading about the various situations in the reviews was funnier than watching them in the movie."
1,Not as good as Rio Ne Reponse Plus,"I had just watched OSS 117 'Rio Ne Reponde Plus' and was excited for another quirky and deadpan adventure with France's version of Austin Powers. Cairo: Nest of Spies is awful though -- humor's weak, less outrageous than the other film, and the cheesie-ness doesn't add to the charm, it subtracts."
1,Cheap stupid knockoff of James Bond,"I put this in after shovelling 12"" of snow from my driveway, my neighbor's driveway & the garage roof.I was expecting comedy.WRONG!:(I watched the first 15 minutes.ENNUIYeah, I'm a polyglot.I'll put it in again this weekend, but I doubt I will watch too much more of it.AVOID LIKE FREEDOM FRIES"
4,Hilarious!,"My wife and I saw this last night at the opening night of the Wisconsin Film Festival. It did not disappoint. As an earlier reviewer stated, if you are a fan of the James Bond series of films...in particular the Sean Connery version of Bond...then you absolutely MUST see this! I was thrilled to see it is available in a Region 1 format. Highly recommended! :)"
3,Its okay.,Saw this both on the big screen and the small screen. Was a funny campy hit when it first came out and it was only later that I realized the actor was the same one as in the Artist. Watch it and form your own opinion.
5,the best since la cage aux folles,"Actually, I preferred it to la cage aux folles it was richer in comic themes it was so so funny."
1,Buyer Beware!,"If I had gotten the shakers shown in the image, I would have liked them. However, be careful which ""used"" vendor you purchase from. The skakers sent to me by Amazon Warehouse were nothing like the image. They were new, gaudy, kitschy, and in the shape of a turkey. ugly(sorry vendor, but that IS what you sent me. You did refund the price, but not the shipping which was more than the item itself. I learned my lesson!)"
3,Turkeys?!,"I was expecting the pretty salt and pepper set that is pictured. However, I received a set of 2 multi-colored TOM TURKEY shakers. Since I purchased them through a warehouse deal offer for less than $3, it is not worth the trouble to send them back.I checked the ASIN number on the package and on the web listing and they are the same. The turkey shakers I got were predominately bright yellow with azure, coral(red?), brown and dark green accents. They are roughly 4"" x 3"" x 2.5"". I could find no markings on the shakers to indicate the maker or design. The shakers are not bad in themselves, they are just not ""as advertised"". In addition, they do not look like they would match the Churchill China Thanksgiving dinnerware as it appears in the photographs. (The turkeys on the dishes look like real wild turkeys.)I do not know if this was a mix up in warehouse deals or if all the shakers are misrepresented.If someone gets the ones pictured, let me know!"
3,Churchill Thanksgiving Turkey Salt/Pepper ShakerS? NOT!,"These are not Churchill China shakers. They are cute, but not part of the Thanksgiving set. I kept them, although I found cheaper and better quality ones in the stores."
1,Satan's School for Girls,This is a horrible transfer to dvd. I don't understand this because I have a perfect vhs tape of this from Prism Entertainment. The vhs looks remastered compared to this release of the dvd. I also saw a perfect showing of this movie on the Fox Movie channel and I don't mean the remake. So why can't they put this on dvd looking great? I have seen the other dvd releases of this movie also and they are about as bad as the Cheezy Flicks.
1,Satan's Pool for Girls,"Given the date, the graininess was expected and made me feel like I had caught a time machine to the drive-in. Too bad the transfer from the original is horrendous, not unwatchable, but really really neglected.Enjoyable 70's Satan's Girls Flick, despite the implausible identity of the Satanists. Movie 4 stars, but the DVD is dark, overly grainy and the quality could be better -1 star."
5,I loved it as a kid and still do!,"This is an older movie of the week that ABC used to have on in the 70's. I miss them as there were some great ones at the time. This is one of my favorite ones. I wish the video was better but it is better then nothing and in a way makes you feel like you are a kid again or watching the late show on a Saturday night, when the host can't afford a clear perfect copy. There was a remake made some years later with Kate Jackson as the head mistress of the school, but it was not as good as this one is. So if you like older made for TV movies like I do, give this one a try!"
2,Bad Quality,"This is a low-budget, made-for-tv horror movie. Don't expect much. If you're a fan of Charlie's Angels and want to see Kate and Cheryl several years before the show hit the air, this movie might be worth a look. However, the transfer is terrible. It looks like there was no effort to clean this baby up. You can also find this movie on a disc of four movies entitled ""Evil Places."" Ironically, you can usually get that 4-movie disc for cheaper than you can get Satan's School for Girls alone."
1,Horrible transfer from VHS to DVD,"This is not a review of the movie, but of this DVD. Can I say that there is no attempt to make this movie into DVD quality. It's like a transfer of an old film (without any restoration), with all the specs and ribbon lines across the screen, straight to disc. There was also times when the film wobbled(?). Also I don't know why they bothered to put a title menu in, it doesn't work. It'll only play and you have to press the stop button on your remote to stop the film, because you sure can't press menu on your remote to go back to the title menu. This is the first time this has happened to me.Only get this DVD if it's the only way you can get this film to see, or you're desperate. If you can get an older version of this film that wasn't put out by Cheesy films, then do. Thank goodness it only cost $8.99. Cheesy flicks is right and I'm not talking about the movie."
3,a rhinestone in the rough,"a lost gem for fans: a collection of live tracks spanning wood's career. raw, primitive and thoroughly enjoyable rock'n'roll as only woodie can dish it up."
3,Pretty Beat Up,"I'm a huge Ronnie Wood fan but have to give this release just 3 stars as it contains such a mix of RW tunes from all over. No real continuity here. Songs are still classics, it's just the presentation here that sucks."
3,Excellent product WITH proper maintenance,"There are so many good things about this product. Most are obvious and the rest are stated in other reviews. However, I do want to explain how you can easily render this product totally USELESS..... accidentally of course.The problem is ONLY with the battery, as is with MANY products. A word now about SLA (sealed lead-acid)battery maintenance for those who may NOT know this. If you drain more than 1/2 the charge of one of these batteries... AND then let it sit that way for a few days....a chemical reaction takes place that prevents the battery from charging further. Bottom line is that I let the drained battery sit too long and it no longer could be charged. Not wanting to waste this otherwise great product..... I went to ALOT of trouble to remove the battery and set it up to use any external 12v battery.My suggestion to the manufacturers would be to make replacing the battery possible and able to use an external battery."
4,Black & Decker PS400JRB,"The Black & Decker PS400JRB is a good fit for those that need a little juice in the great outdoors or anywhere away from available AC power. My wife and I compete with our dogs on weekends, and most of the showsites are without electricity. The Electromate has 12v outlets for small appliances like RV fans when it's hot, and portable DVD players for the downtime between runs. There are also 120V inverter outlets for light equipment such as fans that need 120v and laptops or portable TV's. A few clubs in the area use one to power electronic timers and P.A. horns for the trial all day. It has a built in radio, and works great with the iPod car transmitter plugged into the 12v outlet and plays music at our set-up all day.The only negative I have is the recharge time. It seems to be real-time. If the unit takes 8 hours to run down, it needs 8 hours to charge back to full capacity."
1,"Worked, until it didn't.","There's not much that I can say about this product, except that it worked until it didn't.I would like to express my disappointment, though. After only a small handful of uses it stopped working less than two years after purchase. I always followed directions to ensure good battery life. Alas, it just stopped working and will no longer charge.I would stay away."
5,Great item,"I've used this item to jump start a couple of vehicles, it's worked great both times. I recommend this product."
2,Not the Greatest,"The inverter worked once, then failed altogether. Radio is cheesy. Jump start power works but is relatively weak. Charge indicator lights are funky and innacurate. The price is cheap for a reason."
4,Black & Decker,"This product has come in very handy, tornados came through and we had the radio, as well as we went 500 miles from home and the battery went dead and this saved us. I would by this again!"
5,Jump Starter,"Great product!A bit heavy, and I would have liked for the cables to be a little longer, but still I'm quite satisfied.Kevin"
3,Black & Decker PS400JRB Review,I purchased this product as a replacement for the other Electromate 400 that has the air compressor that I like a lot. I thought the radio was in addition to that feature. I found that the radio replaces the compressor and for me that was not a good trade off. I will be keeping the Electromate 400 with the air compressor and giving this one away as a christmas gift.
1,Wow,I have had many many many successful and beneficial transactions with Amazon.com. But this is not one of them. What can I say? I'm sorry!
4,Delightful!,"I love this book. The stories are unique and creative. One review I read was disappointed because the book wasn't the same as the Nanny McPhee movies but they obviously didn't actually read the book because it is every bit as similar to the movie as any other novel turned movie. I suppose they were too hung up on the idea that they changed her name from Nurse Matilda to Nanny McPhee. My kids are a bit young, but I have every intention of reading this to them when they are a few years older."
1,Total misrepresentation,"The book title gives you the impression that it is about the movie, Nanny McPhee. It is NOT! It is all about Nurse Matilda. There is no mention of Nanny anywhere in the book.The cover has lots of pictures from the movie. I thought I was getting to read more about the movie or more stories about Nanny. I was very disappointed. It is a total rip-off. It is a horrible book. The first story was so boring I stopped before I finished! DON'T get this book!!!"
4,Great shoe,Great shoe! Very rich looking and I love the fit. Nice and snug (no gap in the back)Definitely a good buy!
1,Not for me.,The image on the site is far from what it really appears in front of your eyes. I had to return them. Sorry.
1,"Incomplete, no support, can't find the author.","I can't say that I've finished the book because it's INCOMPLETE! There are many references in the book to a ""companion web site,"" but it doesn't exist! Actually, the site is there, but none of the content that the book refers to. It's either ""coming soon"" or ""under construction."" I've tried called the publishing company twice (NOT toll-free, and long hold times) only to receive a response of ""we'll check into it."" The e-mail address in the book is also incorrect--it bounced back! Finally, I tried to contact the owner of the web site, but the phone number had been disconnected! The ""company"" the site is owned by doesn't have it's own web site and/or can't be found in the Yellow Pages. I can't believe a book that was published so long ago, with an incomplete web site, is still on the shelves selling at full price. I wonder how this even got past the editors! ONE STAR: Because the companion web site should have been finished by now. What an embarrassment."
3,Box set has been recalled!!!,I haven't had a chance to watch the series yet so I won't comment on the series itself.Funimation has issued a recall for this box set. Disc three in every set has a defect that causes audio and video playback issues. The set is scheduled to be re-released in May.Amazon needs to remove their copies and sent them back to Funimation instead of selling defective merchandise.
3,I can confirm the playback issues.,"I bought this item without reading the reviews and I can confirm the playback issues on disc 3. I've only had issues with episode 18, but I can see why a recall is necessary. I'd recommend buying the new release Darker than Black: The Complete First Season."
1,Crappy,"This is the worse mascara I've ever purchased! It's really hard to get it off, it leaves dark stains on the skin, it runs easily into eyes.. absolutely awful!Spend a little more money and buy a good product! Maybelline Moisture Extreme Volume + Length Microfiber Mascara is one of my favorites."
1,Less action than an episode of COPS.,"It's a good thing I never pay full price for these kinds of videos, because most of them fall monumentally short of the hype on the box cover. This one is the mother of all rip-offs. The producers took about 15 minutes of very weak (probably left-over) video and turned it into 40 by adding a brief interview with some guy who might have been a cop, and then using a variation on the ""how to write a speech"" technique: Show what you're going to show, show it, then show what you showed.Most (if not all) of the footage is of LAPD, and the most ""graphic"" of it is a scene in which an officer foolishly forgets how to handle an abandoned sawed-off shotgun and pays for his negligence (actually, his finger pays, and in keeping with the rest of the video, you never really see anything).If you can rent this for a buck at your local library, then *maybe* you might give it a look, but in my opinion it's not even worth that. There's more action in a typical episode of COPS."
2,typical de botton,"another de botton survey, little depth, if you are worrying about your status vis a vis anything, de botton will give you something to compare to. his book ""the art of travel"" is pretty good, i thought he might have more to say. nope."
2,Disappointed in the end,"I enjoyed the tour through literature and philosophy and felt the author did a good job of outlining the nature of the problem. Like other reviewers I was disappointed with the emphasis on Christianity in the end- with graphics of the tortures of hell and commentary about death being the greater leveler.Until I got to that section I sustained the belief that Alain de Botton was writing with some neutrality. His emphasis on Christianity, while ignoring other world faiths and spiritual beliefs have to offer, admits bias and disappoints greatly as the book comes to a close. Certainly Buddhism, for example, would have much to say about status anxiety as well?The first part of the book is much more rewarding to read. By the end of the book when the author starts biasing his comments within an unexpected Christian framework, shattering my belief I was reading a neutral book with intellectual integrity, I was truly sorry I had recommended it to a friend."
2,6 gauge notched captive ring,I was not pleased with this item. The main reason was the gauge differed from one spot to the next on the section that sits in your ear. I ordered them because I liked the look but ended up I couldn't use them because they would always move to the smallest gauge and my piercing would close to that size.
2,doesn't work like we thought.....,"The whole thing is ALOT smaller than you think it's going to be. The base is smaller than the palm of your hand. The Butterflies don't stick to it like the picture.... the first ones stick to the base well enough, but you can't build it like you see in the picture. My 4 yr old lost interest quickly and I'm sure the butterflies are all scattered around her room by now. I'm disapointed in this toy... you don't get what you pay for, that's for sure!!"
3,For Desk Use Only,This product is basically for visual indulgence only. I played with it for a little while but when I seen that the mirror becomes easily scratched and the stickers that are on the butterflies easily peel and tear I stopped. I don't recommend this if you think it'll stay nice and pretty.It is definitely fun and intriguing and the butterflies are pretty :)the price isn't bad for what you get.
4,mascara,"I followed a NYT recommendation and purchased this mascara. It is easy to use, very basic. I would recommend it for daily wear."
2,Disappointed,Not as good as it used to be...clumbs - gave to my granddaughter to use as I didn't like it.
5,This One's a Keeper!,"Great mascara - relatively cheap and dependable. As long as I don't glop it on heavily, it stays put all day. I've been using this product for more years than I'm willing to admit!"
4,Great country love songs,"I bought this years ago off Amazon for the song ""Not on Your Love"" by Hal Ketchem. This is a great collection of great modern country ballads from Curb records and different artists. Is a great slow Country CD to have playing in the background or in the CD changer. Many of the songs have become great country ballad classics."
4,great for first timers,"being a first time mom, my friend bought this for me as a gift. I read it before having my baby and have had to re-read since having him. This book is written in such a way that makes you feel normal! It is really geared toward calming the parents and making them realize that things really will get better and how to help you with establishing a flexible routine. I have also read ""Baby Wise"" and I think that the ""Baby Whisperer"" far more superior!"
3,"Check out the video ""The Happiest Baby on the Block""","""The Happiest Baby"" can teach anyone EXACTLY how to calm their crying newborn in minutes...and help her sleep longer, too."
1,Do not buy. Waste of time.,"This video was super-cheesy, the acting was HORRIBLE and cringe-worthy.I am now dumber for having watched this video.Not much information was shared, things weren't gone into in any detail, the questions were obviously canned, it was filmed on a set, seemed fake, and was not good."
2,The Book is Better,"I'll join in with the other reviewers who recommend the book over the dvd.Very rudimentary information and hardly complements the books. I watched a portion of it before the cheesy acting and simplistic advice wore me down! It went to the thrift store about two days after we received it!If you have ZERO experience with babies, then you may find this dvd of some value... still, the book is sooo much better!Avoid it."
1,"Should be called ""Taking Care of a Baby For Dummies""","We found this DVD to be a waste of time...it might have been better for us if we had watched it before we had our baby. Much of the content focuses on changing diapers, and other basic baby things. We were looking for help with sleep training and the baby routine (which is included in Tracy Hoggs book), not how to give a baby a bath."
3,Good if you are a new parent,"In preparation for our child's arrival we read too many books and didn't watch enough videos. This one and the Harvey Karp video would have saved us a few extra nights of lost sleep if we had seen them before the baby was born. If you've already been around babies a lot, this DVD probably won't teach you much. I really like Hogg's general approach and manner. That said, the script and production on this video are a bit too hokey."
2,Not Much Here,"We watched this video when our baby was 6 months old. There was virtually nothing here that we hadn't learned before the baby's birth by taking classes or reading books. Only mildly interesting and helpful thing was advice on burping a baby. I found her EASY and SLOW acronyms simplistic and not very useful, as were her classifications of the ""five types of babies."" What good does it to do call your baby ""spirited,"" ""grumpy"" or an ""angel baby""? Her advice for a parent asking about a baby who cries a lot: it doesn't hurt him, it opens up his tear ducts. Sheesh. Finally, one would think with all her celebrity clients she could've gotten a few people who could act to be on this video. Even though they're ""real people,"" the acting is painful."
2,Read the book instead,"While Tracey Hogg has some wonderful advice in her book - of the same title - about how to interact with your newborn, the video seems to gloss right over it. It seemed like whole chapters were presented in mere minutes and important sections were left out. Plus, the sections that featured questions from real parents seemed canned and corny. All this being said, the book is terrific. Skip the video - read the book instead."
1,Watch before your baby is born,"Purchase before your baby is born. If your baby is already here, don't buy this video, perhaps if you can find the time, the book may be helpful to read. This video details certain topics, but brushes over some of the more important topics like SLEEPING! Tracy Hogg makes a comment about a 2nd video which details things like sleep, however, I've been unable to find that video."
1,"Cheesy, useless DVD!","My husband and I just tried to watch this DVD. Luckily we only borrowed the DVD from the library. Save your money. This was easily the worst DVD I've seen on infant care to date. What's up with all the horrible acting and the useless tips and facts? We could barely get through the first 10 mins. This was in utter contrast to The Happiest Baby on the Block DVD that we just watched. That was an excellent DVD. If you want to spend money on a DVD re infant care, spend your money on the Happiest Baby on the Block DVD and don't waste time with this one."
1,What was that about??,This video was a waste of time. I had read a little bit about The Baby Whisperer on their forum and had heard from several friends that The Baby Whisperer gave some good tips on baby body language.The video was VERY superficial about Tracy's key acronyms (EASY and SLOW). Tracy would start off talking about something and then would be interrupted by a very random 'Parents Questions and Answers' segment. The questions/answers had no sense of order or focus.I did not learn anything from watching this video and would like my hour+ of time back from watching it!
1,A confusing introduction to contemporary epistemology,"A good book explains a subject in understandable language. Intelligent authors translate complex subjects, when billed as introductions, into terminology understandable by neophytes. Despite the abundance of printed praise on the jacket, this book is an excellent example of the opposite.Perhaps a passage will demonstrate: ""In saying that I justifiedly believe there is a green field before me, I am implying something else, something quite different, though it sounds very similar, namely, that I am justified in believing there is a green field before me.""There is an old rule concerning definitions that states, for clarity, do not to use the same word. This passage deals with defining justification and confounds the matter by attempting to introduce as separate concepts 'justified belief' and 'justified in believing.' There is little clarity here or elsewhere in the text. I sincerely regret purchasing this book."
3,if you're already comfy w/ basic embroidery or sewing....,"... this book may give you whatever little push you need toward working beads into that. There's a smallish section on 'Getting Started,' which offers not-nearly-enough info on beads in general plus a few tips on cloth-needles-thread. You'll need to use your own imagination and needlework experience and do a bit of experimenting. The 20-page section on techniques is the most useful part of the book. There are also 10 projects, only a couple of which I found inspiring or useful. The author could easily have dispensed with the rest of the book : the 'History of Beading on Cloth' (more like a brief overview) and the entire 'Gallery' (not projects, just pictures). The 'Resources' section is especially disappointing; the author chose to list only six bead shops, five of them on or near the west coast."
5,Eye candy,"Wonderfull source of inspiration and very clear how-to explanations to get started in beading embellishments. This book could be usefull for every person interested in textile art, embelished artquilts or crazy quilts. It worth every dollars spent and much more !"
2,Disappointed,I was looking for ideas and inspirations for Crazy Quilts. This book was very disappointing.
4,Very comprehensive - Excellent!,"I am just beginning with fabric arts and this book was just what I was looking for. I had never done beading on fabric before. This book gave a little history, talked about supplies and showed several basic steps. It had several nice projects to work on as well as several lovely pictures of other artists' work. It also goes into color theory and talk about design which I only skimmed over, but that's just me. Overall, very, very helpful for someone starting out in this area."
5,Great for Inspiration,"I have totally enjoyed this book. I had already done some bead embroidery, but this book gave me a lot more to think about and the photos in the projects and gallery sections were very inspirational. While I'm working on a piece, I look at this book to think about new stitches that I haven't done or color combinations and more. I haven't made a lot of the projects, but I use the information from them to build my own pieces. I think this book is a MUST HAVE if you want to create bead embroidered work."
5,love it,I found so many many beautiful designs and so many easy techniques to make the most beautiful things.I love working with beads and this book makes it even more fun.
4,Ringo still has the magic!,"I have been waiting for Ringo to release a DVD with his all staar band. On this DVD he delivers the goods.His allstaars are Richard Marx, Rod Argent (Zombies),Sheila E. (Prince), Billy Squire, Edgar Winter andHamish Stuart. The DVD contains 27 songs. You get great music, outstanding production, awesomesound and video quality. If you like Ringo, you will really like his allstaar band. The song selection couldnot be better, hits ranging from It Don't Come Easy to Free Ride, Time of the Season, to Yellow Submarine.It is a great DVD. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
4,4.5 Starrs! Must purchase for any Ringo fan,"If you're a Ringo fan buy this DVD. The between song interview clips are an enjoyable addition and the cameras and editing were actually focused on Ringo and the band members throughout the concert. Unlike the editors who worked on a Paul McCartney concert video I recently watched, this production crew seemed to grasp that the reason for watching a concert DVD is to view the concert - not the audience. If you've seen one of Ringo's All Starr Band concerts (which I would highly recommend) there's nothing new here but it's great to be able to go back to it any time. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars (I'd actually like to give it 4.5) is due to the inclusion of what I thought were a couple weaker songs - one by Edgar Winter and one by Ron Argent but otherwise this is classic, fun Ringo. Rock on Ringo!"
3,I'm disappointed,"While having Rod Argent and Edgar Winter are TOTALLY everything anyone should wish for on this DVD, I hate that Ringo phoned-in his performance of ""It Don't Come Easy"" at the beginning to get it out of the way quickly. Again-BUY THIS JUST FOR THE ROD ARGENT AND EDGAR WINTER parts-ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Classic Cuts,"Barely a legend in his own time, Root Boy Slim was an infamous Washington, D.C. area personality. You cannot go wrong with ""Boogie Till You Puke,"" which is a brain damaged cousin of the Dead Kennedy's anthemic ""Too Drunk to F***."" If you can find Root's ""Christmas at K-Mart"" give it a try. It's a weirdly spooky slightly scary number for folks who don't care for K-Mart or the Xmas season."
3,"good, but not that good","ive had this album since the year it dropped. the beats are jammin (happy p production), but i would never think this cd is worth over $100's. if you find it for less grab it."
4,It's okay,"It have always used daisy products so me comparing them to others isn't right. I like them, they put out a kick for into be an air gun"
5,Level Headed with BAL,"I've read rave reviews on the pop-up trailer forums about this device and decided to try it. The BAL device cradles the tire of our pop-up and with a little ratchetting action gently lifts the tire and thus the side of the camper until you stop ratchetting. You can be so precise with side to side levelling, which is so important if you run a propane refrigerator. No more trying to drive the camper up onto a stack of boards."
3,A bit confusing,I bought this for a single wheel trailer weighing 2500#. It looked like a good solution for stabilizing the wheel and leveling at the same time. I couldn't find a weight limit rating on the discription of the product but I purchased it anyway. When I got it I still could not find a weight rating in any of the material. I am planning on using it and hoping it performs
5,Well satisfied,I have used the leveler on 3 different occasions. It has surpassed my expectations. I am well pleased with the leveler.
5,Quick and simple method of leveling your camper,"This tool does exactly what it claims. When I get the camper into the spot we'll be staying, I place this under the low wheel and crank it up to level. Very easy. It also serves double duty as a wheel chock.I have not used other leveling methods, so I can't comment relative to other devices.If I did have one suggestion, I would like to be able to breakdown the device for easier packing. Understandably, it's fairly large footprint (has to get around the tire) which makes it somewhat bulky to pack in the popup.Even with it's bulk, I wouldn't want to level my camper without it."
5,huge time saver,i bought two of these for a tandem axle travel trailer (4900lbs). sure they are not meant for it but it worked beautifully.
5,Perfect for my Scamp,"I've had this for the 8 years I've had my 13' Scamp trailer, and wouldn't dream of leaving it at home. It's fast, convenient and stable on all types of terrain. There is no better solution to small trailer leveling, and the quality of the construction makes it one of those few trailer items I never have to worry about."
5,travel trailer leveler,I am a female senior citizen living and traveling alone. This leveler simplifies the process. Don't have to worry about trailer falling off or settling into soft ground. Happy with purchase and prompt shipping
1,The Best of David Houston,"I received this CD as a Christmas present and was very eager to listen to it, having listened to ""Eight Track"" recordings of David Houston when I was dating my late husband. What a BIG disappointment. I thought something had gone wrong with the actual recording process because the beautiful voice I remember was certainly not there. It's very difficult to explain to someone who has never heard his early albums and who has only this CD to judge that he had such a beautiful soothing voice."
1,Rip off,I agree with Gail! Buyer Beware! The photo and product description are very deceiving. There was no mention as to the amount of the tabs so you would assume that you were purchasing two bottles. Not true! I received my order only to find that it contained only one bottle of 90 tabs and I paid way more than what other vendors were offering. I will never purchase from Pet Food Direct as I feel that the company is being deceptive to the consumer. I will be much more attentive to product description from now on!
1,dream sack,The product was not to my satisfaction.. The return policy was not clearly stated and I am still waiting for my store credit. The product was way too small for an average adult..
3,Oil laden,"These mussels are super oily and you really have to drain them well and add a little malted vinegar to cut down on the oily taste. The mussels themselves are cute and tiny but a bit 'mealy' and not much flavor.Also, when I ordered these from Amazon.com these mussels were packed in SOYA oil and NOT sunflower oil. Perhaps they have switched to sunflower oil now which would probably help cut down on the thick oily problem since sunflower oil is a much lighter, healhier oil than soya oil but, I have no idea for certain if these indeed are now packed in sunflower oil since I have no plan on ordering these ever again. Napoleon brand makes some wonderful seafood products but this is not one of their stellar examples imho."
4,"Good for pate, pasta dishes","This brand of smoked mussels is a lot lighter and less salty than others I've tried, and my preferred brand as a result. I enjoy them tossed into a bowl of pasta (works well with a vegetable based tomato sauce), in a spread, or simply out of the can as a high protein snack. Just take care to inspect them for shell fragments as I've gotten maybe one or two pieces out of maybe the last 10 tins or so that still had remnants (this is a bit understandable though given what must be a labor intensive processing method)."
4,"Excellent way to learn, but...","This is by far one of the best ways to learn Japanese that I can think of. Even though it doesn't really teach you much WRITTEN Japanese, it is by far excellent in teaching vocabulary and especially the confusing grammar of Japanese. My only complaint is that unless you can think of ways to make it fun, you could easily get bored with it. The book is very straightforward and doesn't offer the fun that I think other methods of learning the language (subtitled videos, songs, etc.) can offer. But other than that, it is far superior to anything I've run across on the web."
5,Japanese Language - Good book,"The Japanese complete course as exceptionally good value. Well written, great audio and a dictionary to complete the needs of a beginner.I would recommend this course as a great starter kit for anyone wanting to learn the basics of the Japanese language."
2,eggs,"The shipping process was great, however none of the eggs hatched, none. My daughter, who I bought it for almost cried, it was for her science project."
1,None of these hatched.,"Did not have one successful hatching from these eggs. Followed the instructions to the tee. Would not recommend , nor would I purchase again."
2,Didn't work me,"Perhaps it's me, but I tried several times to hatch shrimp, but didn't work for me. . . . ."
3,eggs,i have hd 4 sets out of 4 trys and there was ALOT of shrimp worth the money just do what it says and you will be good
2,dont stay alive,they keep dieing after a weak or so i dont know if its to cold or what? if any one knows tell me because iv tried tones of times
2,They were too small to use in my fajitas,"Given the rapidly rising price of seafood these days, I have been searching high and low for an alternative source to please my pescado-loving pallet. While I had high hopes that I would ultimately be able to raise these shrimp in my outdoor fish garden (mostly old buckets and a few trash cans with crushed gravel in the bottom), they never really grew bigger than maybe a centimeter or so. While they are edible, the difficulty in catching them and then trying to cook them in a skillet was too much to deal with. I guess if you eat them raw like sushi they might have a slightly higher work-to-shrimp-meat ratio, but otherwise I would try to find another brand."
1,Only received 1,"I love the product but I only received one mascara when it clearly says, ""(6 Mascaras)""."
2,"It works, but....","This thing is incredibly flimsy. Unless you're throwing socks in there, you're going to have to get up and put them in yourself. As a college student (one the primary users of collapsable-laundry devices), I find this inconvinient. Additionally, it's a pain to lug to the laundry room becuase it doesn't hold it's shape at all- you end up just kind of dragging it along instead of carrying it, because otherwise it will collapse and bang against your legs."
4,Great for anything....,This is a fantastic product. It fits anywhere and it is convenient to carry around everywhere. I purchased it from Walgreen's. They are sold 2 for $5. I recommend you buy it from there. The material may occasionally rip but that is only if you over stuff and then try to jump on it to get more laundry inside. Otherwise the material is durable and stretchable for any kind of load.
3,CON! You'll only get 1,"The mascara is okay, but this is a con. I am not sure why it was listed as six. I thought that it must have been a certain seller. Well, do not order from A&G Cosmetics because the amounts of their products are not correct. They knowingly use these ads, but they never intend to send the listed amounts. I have had problems with them with more than one item."
2,not like later work,I was disappointed in this cd. I enjoy David Sanborn's playing on every other cd I have heard. On this he switches to soprano sax on several cuts and has yet to find his the style that later defines him.
3,Mixed Bag,"Sanborn has an instantly identifiable sound, no matter what he's playing. This album was from the seventies, and although there are some excellent tracks ( Woody Shaw's Legend of Cheops is given a very fine performance) there are also some of the excesses from the period that bring the overall rating down considerably."
4,Insider's tour of New Orlean's Garden District!,"This book has excellent photographs that show the street facades of dozens of beautiful houses. There are also plenty of interior shots of the mostly antique furnishings for those who wonder what lies behind the porches and columns and through the tall windows.""The Majesty of the Garden District"" also includes some other interesting sites such as the cemetery and several churches. The text is typical of this sort of book and gives brief descriptions, dates, and historical notes.Overall, a nice book to enjoy along with your chicory coffee and Cafe du Monde beignets while reminiscing about New Orleans!"
3,"Suena bien, pero son muchos estilos mezclados","Varias canciones suenan muy buenas y muy divertidas, pero hay muchos estilos diferentes de country en un mismo album eso le resta calidad al disco"
5,favorite,This is one my favorite Christmas albums ever. Have to be sure to bring it out every year and listen to it. I don't get tired of it like I do other Christmas songs. I would highly recommend it.
5,Beautiful ALL Year Long,"Even after I make myself quit listening to this ""Christmas"" CD in January, the songs stay in my head all year long. The lyrics are meaningful; the music is so beautiful."
5,Beautiful!,What beautiful lyrics! Love this whole Christmas tale performed to music! Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for good Christmas music.
3,Amazon download,I down loded the mp3. It's a great CD but the audio quality is poor. I would get it from iTunes for good quality.
1,Do Not Download - Bad Digital Copy,"Do NOT download this mp3 album. There is something wrong with the digital copy on the Amazon site. The sound quality is really bad, and not representative of the actual album. Also, track 8 for ""Labor of Love"" is not the right song.I really appreciate Peterson's ""Behold the Lamb"" album. But this is not the place to get it."
2,"Great album, bad place to buy mp3 version.","This album is one of my favorites, but amazon has decided to lower the bit rate to something unusable. It has a lot of compression artifacts and sounds really bad. After talking to an amazon rep, he said he would talk to their technicians about boosting the quality, but it still hasn't changed. Download this from somewhere else!"
3,It's a bit thin.,"This book (33 pages) does indeed give you an insight into the mind of cops and crooks who might be looking for your stash. The basic insight is this: You can hide stuff in anything that's hollow, or which appears solid but isn't. It is mainly a list of hiding places with few diagrams or how-to construction hints. A much better book for only a few dollars more is Michael Connor's book ""How to Hide Anything."" Not only are the hiding places more diverse, but considerably more ingenious. There are also more helpful visual aids. It occured to me that you might not want to leave either of these books lying out, lest they alert others that you may have something to hide and where you might have put it. Neither book addresses the problem of sniffer dogs."
2,Under 40 pages.....waste of loot.,"Nothing more than a big list with a few example graphics, I get the impression that this book was made by copying some overhead projector stills. Not worth the cost at all. It would take me maybe half an hour to write this book over again and email it to you."
1,Disappointing,"This was not a book, but a list of places someone could hide something. Anyone with an imagination could write the same list. Anyone thinking of buying this book should save their money."
5,Awesome!,"Having a pet sitting business in NYC, I read about the book in one of People's issues. I immediately ordered two copies --- one for clients who recently lost their beloved dog of 14 years to Cancer and one for myself. I have been touched by the beauty of this book and have passed on the information to my clients, family and friends who are pet lovers like myself. It is a beautiful gift from the author to all of those who enjoy having pets and understand their major contribution to our world."
5,careful,"This is a great album. However, it is not as good as their following work. The only reason i am saying this is because i saw that someone is trying to sell the cd for $100."
2,Basic information,This book is great if you are looking for basic information. The pages don't turn very easily and you have to turn the book around to see the next page instead of flipping the page. Would not buy again.
2,Better books on the topic,"Other books on the topic have better photos and better descriptions of the massages. Every massage is prefaced by ""Use CLASS"", an acronym for some system she has. But do we really need to be reminded of this every time? It's annoying. It's very short, too. There's a reason this is a bargain book. I was equally unimpressed by the publisher's book on baby signing as well."
2,"Bland, bland, and did I mention, BLAND!?","I bought this book because it had such glowing reviews and someone even said they thought it was better than the Moosewood cookbook, so I thought it would be great. I cook vegetarian meals minimally two times a week for my family, and needed some more ideas.These recipes sound really scrumptious, but every single one that I have tried is horribly underseasoned both in number of spice(s) and amount. Also, they seem to use quite a lot of oil and cream for a supposedly healthy way of eating. Most of the recipes involving lentils just tasted like paste. I've pretty much given up on this one.I gave it two stars though, because I could find most of the ingredients at our local (and very non-international) grocery store, and the food made was technically edible, though not very palatable."
4,"Interesting, but overpriced story","The ""irony"" reviewer is correct to note that these ""Sixty Minutes"" segments are way overpriced, although some are well worth having. The Pete Carroll segment was particularly fascinating, revealing a side of Carroll that I knew nothing about. I had great respect for him as a coach prior to seeing this segment on ""Sixty Minutes,"" and he seemed to be a genuinely good guy. This story shows that Carroll is every bit as good a man as he is a coach. That this DVD is overpriced has nothing to do with the quality of the story told or the impact it is likely to have on the viewer."
3,Physical Examination of the Spine and Extremities,"This was the text we used in Physical Therapy school. As a beginning PT it was quite adequate but as an experienced PT who needs to have excellent palpation skills to differentiate various structures it lacks a great deal. My favorite books for surface anatomy are 3 books published by Aspen, Diagnosis and Treatment of the Spine, Diagnosis and Treatment of the Upper Extremities and Diagnosis and Treatment of the Lower Extremities written by Dos Winkel, Omer Matthijs and Valerie Phelps"
2,yuck,Am i only one that really did not care for this text? Others are much more negotiable and useful such as Special Tests for Orthopedics. Save your money and check out other texts.
1,"Limited, outdated, inferior to several other similar texts","Stanly Hoppenfeld has written some excellent books (e.g. surgical exposures, orthopaedic neurology) but unfortunately this is not one of them. Our understanding of the pathomechanics of the musculoskeletal system has advanced considerably since 1976 when this text was published. As others have pointed out, there are several important tests that are omitted and the illustrations are mediocre at best. Diagnoses such as shoulder superior labral tears, HAGL lesions, posterolateral corner knee injuries, etc. are not mentioned. This book might be OK for some practitioners, but for physicians it just doesn't cut it. My personal favorite is Bruce Reider's ""The Orthopaedic Physical Examination."" Some people like MaGee's ""Orthopedic Physical Assessment,""-- I don't--but even that book is better than this one. If you need a book on the musculoskeletal examination, choose a different book---there are many better choices out there."
5,Physical examination of the spine and extreities,"It was used but in great shape, the information inside is very helpful during these long hours of studing. go"
2,Much more traditional than you'd think...,"The cover and the title of this book imply a funny, light-hearted, less-tradtional approach to the adventure/ordeal of planning a wedding. In truth, other than stressing the importance of doing what you want, rather than what you're being told you *should* want, this book is very traditional in its advice and approach. While the author does mention a few less traditional weddings in passing (mentioning marrying while skydiving numerous times), none of her advice is geared toward anyone actually taking one of these paths. Also, she seems to assume that every reader has the average $20,000 to spend on a wedding. One would think that a ""best friend"" might have had a few cost-cutting hints here or there. I give this book only two stars because it does not live up to its appearance. It's perfectly good for those of you having a traditional wedding; just make sure you have lots of money to spend if you're going to follow the advice."
3,Putting her at ease,I recently got engaged and my fiance was terrified about all the plans we would have to make. We do not have a lot of money and have to be very careful how we spend the little we have. Lara's tips and tricks and funny stories have set her more at ease. This book is so worth the money it will save in psychotherapy!!! It is warm and fun. We loved it.
5,Peace of mind with a bunch of giggles ...,"I thought this book was wonderful! Lara Carrigan does a great job at making the reader laugh while offering extremely useful information. I have purchased several ""how to plan a wedding"" books and I am using this one almost exclusively! It is great! After I read a couple of pages, I feel a lot less stressed out - which is a good thing for a bride-to-be! I recommend it to anyone planning a wedding! (She has a great sense of humor also!) Lara Carrigan is a princess!"
3,"Easy Read, Limited Help","This was a pretty light, easy read. Not a bad starting place if you've never had any experience with weddings, but not the best option if you're looking for real, organized information to help you plan."
5,THE REAL DEAL!!!!!,"I have never been in the service but have many friends who have. Three of them Marines. I've heard them talk about boot camp. I couldn't believe what they were talking about untill I read this book. The stories by the Marines interviewed seemed to be exactually what my buddies were talking about. I gotta kick outta all the stories. I was hoping there was another story at the end , but I'll wait ti'll theres another book published. Even my buddies in the Army bought a couple books. There are guys at work that want to read the book right out of my hands. Buy the book off the Marine who wrote it, He deservse it. Good job Mike....."
2,Low Quality and Flimsy,This mouse pad is made from a thin piece of pressed aluminum and my one does not sit perfectly flat on the table (not a solid aluminum plate like the Razer exactmat). Certainly not in the same quality and solidness like a Razer exactmat. The kids will easily damage this mouse pad. Not worth the $$ imo
4,A remarkable woman who challenged gender barriers,"I read this book about 20 years ago, so I'm depending on my memory. Dickey Chapelle got her start as a reporter before WW II began. She managed to get a job as a photographer with the Navy during WW II and covered the Pacific arena. She went to Korea during that conflict, parachuting from a plane with GI's. She covered the insurgency in Afghanistan, winning the confidence of the rebel freedom fighters. During the cold war, she wanted to report on people escaping from comunist countries. It was a dangerous assignment and she was arrested. She spent harrowing months in a communist prison before being released. I have wished many times since reading this book that I had not given it away. Dickey was a remarkable woman who was ahead of her time. I say was. She was killed in Viet Nam while serving as a reporter there."
1,bad choice,"I feel very disappointed because it says that they will send you 6 mascaras and i receive only one, and other thing is not water proof..bad choice"
1,"Do not buy this!!! It only comes with One Mascara , NOT SIX!!!","I purchased this on 4/27/10 and when I finally received it, it came with just one mascara, not 6 mascaras. So I talked to a friend who also ordered it and she said she's only received one instead of 6. So when I called Amazon to explain the situation, all they said was for me to pack it and drop it off at UPS store instead of sending the extra 5 for a refund. The reason I order from online is for convenience, not Inconvenience of going out and sending out a package back to them!"
5,Great Lash Mascara,"I've been using this brand of mascara for years. Sometimes branch out and try others, but this is the best."
1,DO NOT BUY - MISLEADING,In the description it clearly states 6 mascaras - I wish I would have read the reviews before ordering because you only receive one - It costs more money by ordering it this way than if I would have went to my local store and purchased it. Very disappointing... wish they would rectify this situation
1,Same Problem as other reviewers,"Only came with 1 mascara not six, very misleading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Therefore, also made the product a bit expensive."
2,HORRIBLE!,I really don't know how this mascara comes so highly recommended. It's horrible. Generally I don't see much difference in mascaras and don't see the point in buying super expensive ones but in my opinion there are MANY other options at the drug store that are FAR superior. This mascara never fully dries and smears easily.
3,More matte than glossy,"I was expecting ""photo paper-glossy"" and am a little disappointed not to have the SHINE. The weight is sufficient for the books I'm hoping to print so I'll just have to make this work."
1,BE AWARE- PHOTO IS OLDER VERSION (& BETTER) FOR THIS ITEM,"I thought that I had discovered some of the older stock of this paper. The photo shown is that of the box cover that had the much better paper. HP's newer version, is awful, both in paper color and texture. Will buy plenty of this when they return to the original product. From what I have read, many others are not happy with this.This is a problem for HP, NOT THE SELLER, though they are responsible for posting the correct box cover and description."
5,Great double sided photo paper,"I hesitated before ordering this because I read the reviews. It seems there are some who think what they received is not equal (quality wise) to what they've received in the past. I've never had brochure paper before, so I had nothing to compare it to. However, I was making small booklets where I wanted double sided photo paper. After a few Googles, I realized I should search for 'brochure' paper. Since I was on a deadline, even after reading the reviews, I ordered this paper. I'm glad I did. It was perfect for my project & I just ordered another box."
3,"Great for Professional Looking Flyers, not esp. glossy, but not esp. matte.","For my purpose, creating marketing mailers, it allowed for a decent interpretation of the look I was going for. It is the perfect weight but I did not have as great, crisp definition as I did on HP's Color Inkjet printer paper. The color inkjet printer paper produced refined reproductions of the artwork while the Brochure Paper was a bit blurrier, almost shapeless as the white in the design melted away into the paper. This did not occur in the Color printer paper which I paid about five bucks for at Target. So, it is definitely flawed. I have the HP Photosmart Premium Web which is made for professional looking graphics and color printing. I know it isn't the printer as it produces flawless work. And I don't have the previous brochure paper to compare it to as the other reviewers. But disappointed all the same. Will try the Premium Plus paper series in hopes that it does a better job."
1,It came in an open box -- no shrink wrap,"I like the paper itself, but was surprised that the box had come without any shrink wrap and was already open. I don't even know it it was a full box, as I was not about to count every single sheet. And I was just to lazy to go through the process of returning it and risk getting another one in the same condition. All I can say is, I won't be ordering from this vendor again on Amazon."
3,An in-depth look into the history of Worcester,"This book is a helpful resource for anyone wishing to understand the history of Worcester, MA from the 1880s until the 1920s. The theory is that the investigation of leisure time has been overlooked, and this book is an effort to remedy this. It's written in an academic tone, so it's not for everyone. It goes into detail about the changing nature of work, how the local tycoons pitted the workers against one another by deliberately recruiting people from antagonistic ethnic and religious backgrounds, but the book shows that the workers sometimes banded together and won out. It describes the nature and use of saloons, movie theatres, amusement parks, and 4th of July celebrations in a day and age when most workers toiled for 10 hours a day, six days a week, with about 3 holidays a year."
5,neat toy,"Great cheap toy for all ages - bought mine at yard sale for a quarter. Can also be used for fridge magnet, metal board holder, etc. Great stocking stuffer."
1,Wait for a debugged version!,"Potential buyers should first read reviews at VersionTracker.http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/15738&vid;=174501&mode;=feedbackI fully agree with these reviews, Endnote 8.0 should not be purchased"
1,Buggy,"I am using a G4 Mac running 10.3.9. There seems to be a bug between Endnote 8 and the Palm desktop software v4. If I run the latter, the Endnote will crash when attempting to connect to the internet for searching literatures. When it does connect, it downloads references from the internet much more slowly than v6. If Endnote 6 is working well for you, DO NOT upgrade as you will gain very little with this one and there is a potential risk of bugs."
4,Same book different cover,"This is exactly the same book, just a different cover, Hawk vs the vampire, and the murder in the sorcerer gaunts house, god killer, and the one with the politician hardcastle, it is just a different cover. I returned it for a refund."
4,Niceeeeee!,"When my 8-year-old son asked for a mini-fridge, I was a bit skeptical -- and admittedly amused.This was a perfect item for his room. It gets cold quick, can work in the car and home, plus has a heating/warming function (which we haven't used).It does produce some white noise, but nothing like a larger fridge.Also, it's small ... like smaller than you'd expect. We get him the mini-cans of soda and hit holds about eight of them. Not too bad. Keeps drinks super cold, which is great."
3,1 year is all you will get,"It worked good for one year. Had in my office - stored pop, yogurt, etc. It was awesome while it worked. Not sure if the price is worth getting a new one vs walking to the break room to get a soda."
5,OK,Let's clear something up here. This unit is NOT quiet. You must be hard of hearing if you think it is quiet. ITS NOT.For comparison sake it is about as noisy as my XBOX cooling fan if not a bit louder. It's not fun to have in my room. Secondly it is not a real fridge so it has nowhere near the cooling capabilities of a regular sized fridge. Those of you who thought you'd pay $50 for a real fridge grow up. It keeps them pretty cold its fine. Those of you who expected to see icicles on your coke are not high school graduates. Thirdly the latch is not perfect on this unit. You only have to open it a small amount to unlatch. I can just picture some idiot who hasn't learned not to force things when they don't open and that's why it broke off. It gets 5 stars because it is exactly as I expected it would be and is visually appealing. for $50 I didn't expect much.
3,Not what I expected,"First I want to say it's adorable, but it doesn't work for what we wanted it for. My husband is a diabetic and we wanted to use it to store his insulin. The insulin has to be stored at between 32 and 42 degrees. This refrigerator only got down to 50 at it's coolest. It was too cute to send back so I use it for little bottles of juice for the grandkids and they love it."
5,Fun little fridge,"This little coke machine/ fridge is just adorable. The retro look adds a fun and stylish look to a truly functional mini fridge. It is a great item to have in your office, craft or any room where you would like to have a cool little treat close at hand. It is also perfect for dorm rooms. I highly recommend this item for yourself or as a gift."
2,NOT COOL FOR LONG...,BOUGHT THIS ITEM BECAUSE IT WAS SMALL AND I COULD KEEP MY INSULIN AND SOME ORANGE JUICE IN IT. STARTED OFF WELL ENOUGH. BUT SOON ENOUGH IT STOPPED COOLING. LASTED ONLY 6 MONTHS!
2,Nice but doesn't last long...,"Product is good for short term use. It does keep drinks cool.... however, not really designed for long term use. Blows out after a few months on AC....I recommend this for travel only.... use on trips in vehicles... best use...Product looked similar to photo provided.Be aware that the handle on the door is plastic.... be gentle with it."
1,sad,I bought this mini-frig to replace the one I had for over a year. This one lasted 1 month and died. Don't buy it because it won't last.
2,A little cooler...than room temperature,"The cooler, even when left unopened for 8 or more hours, did very little to cool cans of soda. And after 4 months, it stopped cooling altogether. I wouldn't buy another or recommend to a friend."
2,Be careful when opening,"Am returning the product, as the handle broke when I was trying to open for the first time. In fact, I was never able to get it open."
4,Great little Fridge. IT COMES WITH AN AC CORD!,"Just want you to know the Fridge COMES WITH AN AC CORD, so you don't have to buy the 12 volt transformer Amazon suggests you buy. It keeps soda cold, but it will not hold a 20oz bottle of water.Keeps the soda nice and cold. Make sure you keep a few sodas on hand as it will cool a warm can of soda in a day. I keep 4 cans in the cooler and still have space to put a sandwich or entree.Watch the opening handle as it turns side to side and could snap off if pulled. If the handle was built a bit stronger I would have given it a five star review."
2,Cute but would not recommend,This is a cute nostalgic product but it died on me. I was very disappointed.
1,Coke Mini Frig,"We have been searching for a mini frig for a few sodas in an office. This seemed the right size, yet when we opened the door - the little plastic door clip broke right off. I will say that Amazon was great about replacing the frig immediately, yet I don't have a ton of confidence in this product."
1,Poor product,"Purchased this to use in a bedroom. Several problems. Noisy, runs constantly. Does not bring items in the fridge down to being ""Ice Cold"" as implied on the door of the mini fridge, will only cool items in the fridge to about 42 degrees. Far cry from being icy and cold. Cool, not cold. Would not recommend to use in a room where you want quiet to sleep with. It is not very noisy but does run constantly."
1,this fridge is shit,when the fridge arrived in the mall i opened the box and plunged it in and it didn't work then i had to re wire the whole thing but now it runs of USB so i would not recommend buying this piece of s*** you call a mini fridge
1,Not work,I am a international buyer and it don't work... So I can't send it back but still works for block the door.
5,birthday,"Iam a coke collecterand a friend got me this cooler for my birthdayhave already taken it on a little trip, keeps your coke ice coldlooks nice and works great!!!!!"
3,SoSo buy,Just what I ordered. Im okay. Product works. Does not get super cold I WISH I COULD ADJUST THE DEGREES OF THE FRIDGE. I WILL GIVE IT AWAY FOR A GIFT NOW.
3,Does What It Is Supposed To,"Well, this mini=fridge is very tiny, and a little loud because of the fan, but it does a pretty good job of cooling things off. I use it in my room sometimes and when I want to take it places with me, it is very portable and light so I can put it in a bag and go. Overall, I give this product 3 stars, because I think there might be a few nicer ones out there to purchase, but for the money this isn't a bad deal and its got a cute design."
5,good buy,"works very well, kept several drinks cold during a road trip in July with no ac in the car.I use it daily at my desk, keeps semi frozen drinks well for hours"
3,Decent product,I use this to keep water bottles and soda cans cool in my office. I would say that they get slightly chilled. Within 5 minutes of pulling out a bottle the dring is already at room temperature.
4,Cool with Coke Mini-Frig,"We bought one for our son at Christmas and then my husband wanted one for his office at work. It is adorable to look at, we are huge coke fans. We like the size also. It works well. If you need a mini frig for a couple of cold drinks this is for you! If you need to keep a lot cold you should look for a larger size appliance."
2,worked well for a couple months then quit,The little fridge was great at the beginning but then just quit working well after a couple months. I can still hear the fan running but the soda is room temperature.
3,"Ok, but not a ""fridge""","By no means is this a ""fridge"". I thought it would actually chill items, but they should be cold when placed in the unit. The reason? Because unlike a normal fridge, this unit only lowers the temperature inside to 25 degrees below ambient temperature. And when left on, it is considerably louder than a normal fridge. Other than that, its pretty cool (no pun intended). It seals closed fairly well. It also comes with both an AC and a DC plug, so you can bring it with you on the road."
3,Constantly between 42-50 degrees.,"This fridge (at least for me) only cools to about 25/30 degrees below room temp. Its constantly close to 45 degrees which is great for what I use it for (keeping medicine cool), but have tried using it for beer and to be honest it fails there.So all in all, it works for what I bought it for but if it was for keeping a beverage frosty....I wouldn't think it could meet my expectations."
3,Cute & Cold,"This is really cute. It kept the soda really cold. I hoped it would hold 4 sodas and my lunch, but it wasn't tall enough - 2 sodas and lunch worked fine. I returned it, though, because it is VERY LOUD, and for an office, that was not appropriate."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,Initially the mini fridge worked well but as time went by (approx. 6 months) the unit stopped keeping items cold and now does not work at all. Don't waste your money!
3,A bit noisy,"I received this last week, and while I did like it (it's really cute), I ended up returning it. I bought it to have next to my bed, since I'm a Cokaholic, but it was a little too noisy and hubby complained about it. It was a total luxury item for me. Also, it really didn't keep my Coke as cold as I like it. However, I will say that Amazon is such a pleasure to deal with when returning items. I haven't returned many, but it's so easy to do: just print out shipping label and bar code, and that's all there is to it. Never a hassle like with some other online companies. Two days after I mailed it back, I got an email from Amazon that they had received it and refunded my money. I liked this item so much, though, that I may get one for a gift or something at some point in the future. It's a great novelty item for the Coke lover. It holds six cans, so it would be great for a spare bedroom, too."
2,Worked well for a while...,"I bought this little fridge in late spring and enjoyed it all through the spring and summer. It never worked as well as a large fridge or a high quality mini-fridge, but for the money it did the job. Plus, it looked great in my room.Then, when October rolled around, I tried to put some drinks in it for a Halloween party, and it simply didn't turn on. The warranty only lasts 90 days, so there's no chance of getting a replacement/refund.Buyer beware! This might seem like a great deal, but you get what you pay for. This thing does NOT last."
3,Fridge tht only runs warm and hot,"Yep, pretty disappointing. I want my beverages chilled, not heated. It shuts nicely but it's main purpose, to cool my soda, doesn't work. On the cold function it was warm and overly hot on the the warming function. Almost worrisome, I wouldn't recommend going through all the trouble. It's not worth it. Sorry!Update:Has had a speedy delivery of a replacement, and this one works wonderfully. Cold to the touch, it keeps my beverages a nice temperature! The fan is kind of loud, but it's a nice little fridge, if you're looking for durability look elsewhere, but if you're looking for something you can chug around on a road trip (yes it plugs into your car) or just a little something for your dorm or little office, it's quite nice! Make sure you keep it dry though, and clean it continuously! Don't want anything rancid to stay in it, do you?"
4,Perfect for sodas,"Would recommend for anyone sick of fighting for soda in the communal office fridge. I've only had it for a week, but it keeps my sodas very cold (I was worried about temperature when reading other reviews). Only drawback is the fan noise, but I put it far enough away from me that it doesn't bother me. The actual logo on the front is nicer than the stock ""Things go better with Coke"" photo too. Good buy."
1,Short-lived cute plastic box!,"This little fridge lasted all of 2 1/2 business days in my office (and the fan vents were not blocked). It was unplugged at the end of the day for the first two days. On the third day the fan suddenly stopped running after a few hours and the little green power light went dark.On the plus side, it is an excellent white noise generator for an office environment. I don't think I'd want it running in my bedroom though.Amazon was quick to send a replacement unit which will hopefully last much longer than the original!"
2,Noisy,"We got this for the bedroom. It is cute and has a good small size, but we can't leave it in the bedroom as it is VERY noisy..."
3,Soo cute,Really nice item getting lots of compliments on it!!!! absolutely good size for a small workspace. Definately would recommend to anyone
3,cute little thermoelectric cooler but too small for water bottles,The Koolatron 6 can cooler is eye catching and cute and does kool cans nicely. But it is too small to hold and cool the .5 L water bottles so I would like the next larger model but it is listed on Amazon as pre-order. I would like to exchange this but cannot since the next size is displayed on Amazon but not available. Very frustrating.
2,Does Not get warm,"I got this fridge and although it shipped quickly, it was not what I was expecting. There is no option on the fridge to get warm. The switch goes to either ""off"", ""AC"" or ""DC"" so you can plug it into the outlet or your car, but when it is on it only gets cool. Amazon says that this product will get up to 149 degrees Fahrenheit, however, it does not. I will return this item because the description was wrong.Also, the fridge gets pretty cool, but not cold. It's like when you have a can of soda in the regular fridge but then leave it out for 20 minutes."
4,Great for the office,"The only thing keeping this from receiving 5 stars is I wish that it was a little colder. I have a preference for near frozen drinks, other then that it's great! The perfect size for sitting on my desk at work, and keeping a small selection of drinks around."
4,"Keeps things COOL, not COLD.","I bought this with realistic expectations: I didn't think it was going to keep my drinks ice cold and it doesn't. But it keeps things cool enough to be worth it. I use it at the office; my office building outlawed dorm-sized fridges and this is a good alternative. Yes, I wish it kept food and drinks a bit colder and it would be nice if it was bigger inside but I can keep three 10 oz. bottles of water and one yogurt cool and that's good enough for me. They also improved the latch on it; it's not as flimsy as the latch shown on this product page. I'm pleased with it and I think it's a good buy as long as you know its limitations."
1,waste of money,i purchased this same fridge for my desk at work. after 3 days it died. the only reason i got my money back was because i had to call the copy and complain. when it worked my snacks for the day was cold. but the has to be a better quality product out there.
3,Mixed Emotions,This has been great for my Mom's room (in a Nursing Hm) until someone broke the handle (which I feared from the beginng}.It is still cooling great and is the perfect size for her room.Does anyone have an opion on how to fix the handle?R there replcements available? She is not able to open it at all now and I personnally have to put a lot of concentration in to it to grab the nub to open.
4,Coca-Cola personal fridge,I bought this item for my girlfriend. She uses it at work to keep milk or a soft drink at her desk. It works very well and was a good price.
3,Coca Cola KWC-4 personal fridge,"I purchased this for my wife one year ago and the first thing to go was the little handle to open the door. People tried to pull on the handle instead of turning. After one year of use, the fan made noise and finally stopped working. I took the unit apart and was able to purchase another muffin fan from a local electronics store for $22, almost half what I paid for the fridge. Now the unit works fine ,, hopefully for at least another year."
2,Poor Temperature Control,The fridge does not maintain temperature well. This item not recommended to purchase due to poor temperature control in my opinion.
4,"Works, pretty hard","It works.It looks cool.It is pretty loud, especially considering how small it is.Make sure you note the dimensions on the inside.Overall I am happy."
1,I hate it,"I bought this item to keep some juice boxes cold for my sone what a disappointment because it never kept the old things cold, do it never cold anything. DO NOT BUY"
4,Ok if you like cool drinks.,"It's stylish, it looks cool in your room or an office but....it only cools drinks at best. But most people won't buy this to use on a regular basis Maybe you can use it for your bait :)"
1,Do not buy,"This fridge is constantly running and doesn't even get cold! I read the reviews before purchasing it, and saw the majority of the reviews were positive, and I do not understand why!!?!? So misleading,do not buy this piece of junk."
4,travelling,"Just the right size for a travelling fridge, big enough without taking up too much room, essential when travelling as a vacation."
2,Koolatron is the right product name,"This is a very cute, and quiet refrigerator, and the right size for my office. BUT... it only keeps the items somewhat COOL but never cold. I still need to add ice to the beverages. I found however, it does help to place a frozen bottle of water inside with your drinks to get them colder, or put the drinks in the freezer until they are very cold, then place them in the mini-refrigerator. If you want to keep water bottles in there, you will need to buy the smaller bottles, or they won't fit.And as for keeping items WARM, there is NO control or switch on this item anywhere to use this feature. So if you want cold drinks, or to use it to keep items warm, buy elsewhere. With this item, I guess I got what I paid for. I am now in the process of looking for another personal refrigerator that works like I need it to."
1,Great if you like your drinks barely above room temperature,Not much to say other than the fact it works best when you only put a couple cans of soda in it. Other than that I hope you love your drinks to be only a little cold.
2,Great little product - for about a year!,"I bought one of these fridges for my office last year. I loved it for a couple of months, it was so convenient to leave a few groceries at work in my little fridge. But then it started to make noise when the motor was on, and it got louder and louder till it was too annoying to leave on.I think it lasted about 10 months. I would rather spend a little more and get a product that won't be in the dump next year."
3,Beware Variants!,"I purchased the Coca-Cola personal fridge for my wife who collects Coke paraphaernalia. And while she was very pleased with her suprise, I was taken back by mine. The item received did not display the ""Things Go Better With Coke"" slogan filling the fridge door, as shown in the ad photo, but a smaller coke logo ""sold here""... tampo printed message across the door. While the item is still very nice and I would have probably purchased it for my wife anyway, my message is this: Beware Variants!"
3,"Cute, but...","I got this for my office desk for my lunch. It fits nicely on my desk, and I've gotten compliments on the look. It definitely keeps my lunch and drinks cold for the day. It is really light weight which is good; along with that is there is apparently no insulations, so it runs constantly. It emits a constant ""white noise"" because it runs continuously--no thermostat shutoff/control. For the first day it ran, it emitted that ""burning off"" chemical smell which filled up my little office, but it was gone the second day. Because it cools quickly, if I eat/drink up everything I have in it, I unplug it and leave the door open a bit. Also, I unplug it (empty) for the weekend--I don't leave anything in it for the weekend. That is not an issue, because come Monday, it will keep cool whatever I bring in that moring."
3,looks good,These small coolers seem to keep drinks pretty cool but only if they are cold when you put them in. If you are looking for really cold drinks these are not for you.
3,Good fridge but small and noisy,This is very small and extremely noisy. It does keep things cold but can only hold a few small items.
2,Not good,"Not a good working mini fridge. The inside plug detached from the side, so you could not unplug the unit afterwords. The cooler was not good at all, barely kept drinks to a chilled state. Within 6 months my unit fried and is not longer operating. Not recommended."
5,Great desktop fridge,"I use this at work to keep my selzer chilled, my ypgurt cold until I am ready to eat it, etc. It i great for work so I have easy access to my snacks (I bring a lot) without having to store them in the communal fridge. I would not keep anything like dairy or other parishable things in it overnight, I don't think it keeps temp under 41 degrees but works for what I need it for."
4,Good,"The door uses a latch system, instead of a regular magnetic closure, so you need to pay attention that you closed it correctly. Cools drinks to an acceptable level. A good product for the price and great for the freshman college student with limited space in the dorm."
2,Died after 6 months,"Disappointing... it started making odd noises after maybe 3 or 4 months, then seemed to gradually cool less, then stopped working. Warranty is only 90 days. Bummed."
5,Love it,"I bought this a couple of months ago to solve the issue of people ""accidentally"" taking the wrong soda from the communal fridge and it has worked out great. One thing I have found is that the more cans you have in the fridge the more efficient it is at keeping them cold. Otherwise it is probably a little too loud to keep on top of the desk but definitely works great under the desk."
4,Cute and Handy too,It's cute and I like that you can use it to keep stuff warm or cool in the car as well. Pretty neat little device. Latch mechanism is a somewhat cheap otherwise I would give it 5 stars.
3,Cool at best,"I liked the look of this product and the silly door handle didn't bother me, though I had to open it carefully to avoid breaking the handle.The real problem is this mini fridge only gets cool at best, never really cold, and things put in it are kept only a few degrees cooler that room temperature.If I tried to keep a personal yogurt or cheese stick in it from morning to lunch time, I sometimes was afraid to eat it because the food was not cold any more by lunchtime.FYI"
5,Works great.,"Have had this fridge for a couple of weeks now. My son has it in his room to keep bottles of water and a few sodas readily available. So far, so good. It gets pretty cold. Hopefully it will stay that way."
4,Personal Fridge,"This is a very nice little fridge for the money. My company merged and they would not allow me to use my dorm fridge to keep my soda's cold so I bought ths one. While it does not keep the soda extremely cold, it is cold enough to drink. It is also very quiet.Another plus is that it came with a AC/DC plug so that it can be used in the car also."
2,Kept things cool at best,"I bought this for my husband so he could keep his Mt. Dew stash in his office. He loves the nostalgic Coca-Cola emblem and its retro, cherry-red color. Overall, this wasn't worth the money. It barely lasted a year before the motor died. The handle broke off a few weeks after I bought it. He had to monkey around with what was left of the handle to open or keep it closed. He appreciated the thought, otherwise I would have more regrets about buying this. It's very small, fits 6 cans. Doesn't fit 20 oz. bottles. And as my title states, it kept things cool but not cold. The intention after it died was not to replace it, as it turned out to be a big waste of money. bummer!"
2,Noisy AND not cool enough,"We purchased this to keep certain meds in our bedroom, so that we would not have to visit the kitchen last thing at night and first thing in the morning. Sadly, it is too noisy for the bedroom or adjoining bath. Additionally, while adequate for one med, temperature-wise, it does not get cool enough for the other.Do not count on this to cool more than 32 degrees below the ambient temperature.And yes, the door handle does appear ""delicate."""
5,Perfection,"This new A.M. Energy Practice from Shiva Rea is exquisite perfection. She always amazes me but this newest is like a little slice of Heaven on Earth. Shiva Rea's words, thoughts, prayers, directives, guidance, inspiration are invaluable, healthy, empowering, soulful. I am so happy to have this new practice process and feel I will be using it nearly every day for a long time to come. Many thanks and blessings, NJ"
3,Not for beginner,"I think I would have liked this more if I had done a beginner one with her. Her style is a little different, not sure if I really care for it."
3,Meh.,"I'm a beginner/intermediate when it comes to yoga. I have Shiva Rea's, Gaiam Prenatal Yoga DVD and liked her in that so I thought I'd try one of her Acacia DVDs. This DVD was my first experience with her (aside from the prenatal DVD) and I didn't like it much. I thought it was kind of odd. Particularly the Body Mandala 108 and a little of the Shakti Flow (didn't like the Trance Dance). BUT this is just me personally. I think that if you are an avid Shiva user you will love it. I was going to give it 2 stars but I gave it 3 because there were some cool moves I'd like to do someday (in the vira flow) and also I did feel sore muscles the next day, which I thought was good. AND I like that you can choose which part from the matrix which you'd like to do."
3,Freight charges way too high!,"The freight charge was nearly 1/2 the price of the card. I live on the east coast but I did not expect to pay almost 43% in freight. This was standard shippng, no expeditd service. Wen I asked for justifcation from the company, I was told too bad."
5,13th Hour Review,"This is my first foray into horror music. The CD is easy to listen to. I is rather mellow but has a fe up-tempo songs; I prefer mellow, so the overall mix of songs is just right. I liked ""The Watcher"", song 11. I also liked songs 3, 7, and ""the 13th Hour"", which is the last song on the disk.Overall, this is a good disk."
4,Wonderful ambiance,"If you have heard of Midnight Syndicate before, then you don't need to read this review. :)If you haven't then you really can pick any of their albums and get a feel for what they are about. Creepy, mood enhancing, gothic, and exactly what the name of the album says it is, 13th Hour.This album takes you on a tour of the Haverghast mansion, suitably haunted of course by the horrors that took place in the past. What horrors? Well, you will just have to imagine what the track titles ""Cellar"", ""Cold Embrace"", and ""Sinister Pact"" could mean, or you could listen to the samples and get an even better idea.If you are running a role-playing game and need some atmosphere, a haunted house, or just need some good background music for your insane experiments and reading those things man-was-not-meant-to-know, then this is perfect.If you are planning a trip to the zoo with the 4th grade class, unless it is stormy out and it is a zoo of undead animals, you may want to hold off on this album."
1,Sorry guys but just not scary enough,"This was a let-down. There were virtually no sound effects at all on this and it would have really enhanced the music to have some. The best I can say about this product is the artwork is nice and I do love the concept and many of the track titles but really it sounds like someone used a keyboard to mimic an orchestra. Not only that but too many instruments. Doesn't really fit a haunted house setting. I guess it would work while standing in line for a haunt but I've heard much better for much less money. The sleeve was nice with the two handsome musicians. Still, not enough guys."
5,The 13th Hour is my favorite hour.,The 13th hour by Midnight Syndicate is yet another fine selection of music put out the the exceedingly talented musicians of this group. I first came across a couple songs from this CD while looking for spooky Halloween type music on Youtube. After I heard the songs I knew this was yet another Midnight Syndicate CD I had to crack the old piggy bank for. So it is with great enthusiasm that I wholeheartedly endorse this CD by giving it a ***** rating. Keep up the outstanding work guys.Blessings Light & Dark!Doctor Possum
2,Not as good as the other reviewers said!,"I don't know why the other reviews rated this disc so highly. The package may say it is digitally MASTERED but it is NOT digitally REmastered! There was no restoration work done on this disc whatsoever, and it shows. The quality is barely passable, and probably was dubbed off older vhs tapes. I think the other reviewers were just so ecstatic that these episodes were even available on DVD that their judgement got the best of them. In summary, if you can find this disc for a couple of bucks go for it, otherwise, you'd be better off getting the Rifleman and Wagon Train on other DVD editions."
4,very informative,"I have many books on pastels, but this one by far is one of my favorites already. Very well illustrated. Takes you from basics to more advanced. Not sorry I purchased this one. Will use for many years."
5,Educational and entertaining,"Written by Ant in journal form. As he grows up, he rotates through all the different jobs in the ant colony and writes about and illustrates his experiences. From stroking an aphid to get the honeydew to fighting off a ladybug attack to rotating eggs in the nursery to rebuilding the nest after a flood, this book will keep you interested and amazed. My daughter loved this book when we got it for her at age 6. At 9, it still fascinates her."
3,Plastic cups and ??saving money.,"I basically agree with the other reviewer, this is a cheaply made product. Mine did not work at all, it didn't warm up. The instruction manual says to turn on the switch, but there is no switch. The instructions have been poorly translated into English from Canadian French.But the folks in Canada that I called were nice, they had a guy in Florida call me. He paid for Fedex to come pick it up and they sent me a new one.Why did I want one? Being a very frugal person I thought I'd save some money. Then I checked, the quart of skim milk I'd use to make the quart of yogurt costs only 50 cents less. So if you eat a quart a week, it pays for itself in 10 months, then you save a whopping $24 a year, minus your labor. My new one, which no doubt works beautifully, will be sold before I take it out of the cello-wrap."
1,Horrible,I purchased waterproof maybelline by accident and used for about a week without knowing (until today) that it is waterproof. I have no eyelashes left hardly thanks to the waterproof stuff. I don't know how people can get it off without the same thing happening. Perhaps there is a special remover but I would suggest putting something bigger on the pink tube that can be better seen as the bottle is the same as the regular pink tube.
1,The Worst Mascara Made!!!!,"I've worn mascara for about 32 years and this is the very worst! It's not waterproof. After 2 hours of wear I had two black eyes; yes the mascara can't even stay on your lashes for longer than 2 hours without you looking like a line-backer for a football team. Absolutely would NEVER recommend the product. But like most of us, you'll have to take your chance. This is a classic ""you get what you paid for: in this case 2 for a mere $3.98 thanks to your friendly WalMart."
1,Pathetic,"Of all the books I have ordered from Amazon, this has to be the most pathetic of all of them. I can't understand how Amazon could even have this piece of crap on their inventory list, and the price of the book is certainly an outrage. The book is more like a pamphlet, devoid of any intellectual content, and would not even make a good coaster for a cup of coffee. Had I known what this book consisted of, I certainly would have never ordered it, and I fault Amazon for not doing a better job of previewing this s----y publication before putting it out to their customers. Amazon must have felt sorry for the author and publisher to even consider this piece of garbage. I'm thoroughly disgusted with the book, but most of all I am appalled at the price Amazon is charging. If you see this book on Amazon, DON'T BUY IT, IT'S AWFUL."
5,Book sold me on the motorcycle lifestyle,"I ordered this book because I read on some internet forum (I forgot which one) that Egan was a good writer. I dont know how to ride a motorcycle and never had more than a passing interest in motorcycles.Egan's book made me realized how much of my own life I have been missing out on by choosing to travel by automobile.If you are a fan of motorcycles, travel, adventure stories, or good writing, you will enjoy this book"
4,"Not the best, but...","If you love Tenchi Muyo or Tenchi Universe, then you'll more than likely enjoy this series as well. However, i think a lot of fans will agree that this is most definitely not the best series of the three."
3,decent provided you have a PAL player,"A decent improvement over the butchered English public domain version of this flick. Colossus shows a playful Rod Taylor cavorting amongst a hammy but likeable strongman, oodles of women warriors and some surprisingly lavish dance and fight sequences. The producers of this DVD, while using a good color print, filled in the gaps with Italian only footage, without subtitles of any kind. Also, the only format offered is PAL, which very few American DVD players can cope with but is playable on most computers' DVD systems."
3,Funny old movie,"Laughable in it's absurdity... but I watched in awe. Typical B-movie from the late 50's/early 60's. And the main actor is ""Rod Taylor"" - the first reviewer is wrong about ""Rod Tylor"" - the cover has a typo on it."
1,Beware,"Beware that although Amazon lists ""Rod Taylor"" as the star, if you look closely at the picture of the DVD you will see it is really ""Rod Tylor"" who is the star.Update: I see that since I originally wrote my comment that Amazon has corrected the name spelling from ""Taylor"" to ""Tylor"". Good enough."
5,Great Product,"While I pre-ordered mine from rightstuf, it's nice that the Dragon Box is being supported.It would have been nicer if ""Z"" was redubbed in the same fashion as Kai and with the obviously better script, we can't all win right? Anyway, I'm a fan of the Japanese version so it doesn't bother me at all. There's kai for the English version.The episodes take place right where box 3 left off, and should go up to the beginning of the Cell Games.They better put Son Gohan on box 5!That leaves SSJ Son Goku with Box 6, and Piccolo for Box 7(or vice versa)"
3,Nice Hiking Guide,"Trails are a bit obvious, nothing really special that you couldn't find online. Good for begginers, not great for the experienced hiker."
3,Sorta so ... so,I need a replacement for a wrap bandage that I have just due to wear. I ordered this because I wanted one with velcro closure. The problem with this piece is that it only has velcro on one end. This allows it to slip upon extended use.
1,BEWARE: Five-star reviews do not refer to the edition published by Acheron Press!,"This edition of The Crawling Chaos, published by Acheron Press, is NOT a compilation of Lovecraft's stories. This edition contains only one story (The Crawling Chaos) of about 18 pages. To the story itself I'd give neutral 3 stars.However, I give this edition (ASIN: B00815UE0C) only 1 star so as to alert the publisher, Amazon and potential buyers."
3,OK,Somewhat disappointed but I did learn some more info about this St. who I'd read about in The Catholic Digest. Wish there was more to it and was high priced for the size of the book.
1,poorly made,"On my first use with this, the carrying strap broke off. On my thrid use the other strap broke off. Leaving me to carry my laundry as if it is a paper bagged groceries. don't buy this junk!"
5,Fast little sucker!,Works fine. Fast but loud. A little hard to fold and unfold but I can live with that.
4,The Best Work on the Subject,"There have been some reasonably satisfying works written on the cultural aspects of tuberculosis, and others on the scientific struggle to understand and control the disease. What makes this work unusually rewarding is that Dormandy (a consultant pathologist and medical writer) possesses the ability and education to bring together TB's medical and cultural aspects. He is equally comfortable discussing the influence of TB on the German Lied tradition and the interaction between the disease organism and the immune system.The White Death is particularly strong on TB's influence on European high and Bohemian culture and on the stories of individual scientists and doctors involved in research and treatment. Dormandy has a bit less patience for the bureaucratic history of public health and the political intrigues of academia, a feeling I share. I particularly enjoyed the opinionated and informative footnotes."
3,"Rigg shines, Despite Odd Score Changes","Diana Rigg is the star of this recording. She takes Phyliss' new numbers ""Ah, But Underneath"" and ""Country House"" and makes a new charachter.I was thoroughly dissapointed by Julia McKenzie. Her ""Losing My Mind"" is the most unmoving, over-the-top, melodramatic rendition I've ever heard.Ben (Daniel Massey) has had his two best numbers cut ""Road You Didn't Take"" and ""Live Laugh Love."" They've been replaced by the cutsey ""Make the Most of Your Music"" that doesn't live up to the scores standard.The rest of the cast is bland and forgettable with the possible exception of a funny ""Buddys Blues"" and an odd ""Broadway Baby"""
5,"Best ""Follies"" of all","This is by far the best recording of ""Follies"". I saw this production 1987 in London with the great Diana Rigg. I understand totally why this production had a longer run then the original from Broadway. Sorry, but the Broadway-recording is lousy."
3,A heavily revised FOLLIES,"For the 1987 London production Sondheim wrote 4 new songs and dropped 5 from the original. None of these new numbers are improvements, and Sondheim has since withdrawn this edition from performance suggesting that he himself was not satisfied with the revisions.The first release of this was a double CD and to fit the material on a single disc a minor track called ""Social Dancing"" has been dropped. It's not a formal song: Just random dialogue bits spoken by cast members over thr orchestral ""Entr'acte.""The cast here is unremarkable, and with so many other FOLLIES discs available one can easily - and safely - bypass this version."
4,Didnt kno it was blu ray but...,I didnt kno I bought the blu ray altho im considering buying a blu ray player I have heard many good things about this movie I bought it n got it quik in the mail! Super quik if u wanna be technical. I am anxiously waiting to see this....Update 4/19/2012Been long since I came back here. Im currently looking for the.nxt blu ray. This anime is much different then the usual anime with alot of action n violence. The anime makes for a good story. I like different things outside of the norm so.this was intresting to me.
3,Unfullfilled Something-or-otherness,A bit of Magic - or Science Fiction - gets us started and re-enters every time some-body gets into trouble and this bunch of late-teens early-20s rattles around doing things (?)(!) until they finally wind up doing - - - what???Dunno.
2,Caught off guard!,"Well as some other people, I went into buying this blind and came out disappointed. I understand that it wasn't suppose to be filled with action but the least this show could do is try and keep the watcher watching. The only reason I kept watching was because I felt that maybe ""something"" might happen in the next episode but nothing came. I am open to new anime and seeing what they bring to the table but I was sadly upset with the show ""genre"". Left with alot of questions at the end...thanks for reading my first review :D"
2,Lame,"For an 11 episode series this one was just plain lame. There was no action, no character development and a loosely put together story. Bought this one on a wim and it did not pay off. A pretty pricey series for not delivering any excitement. You should be watching something else. The animation was not that bad just a bad script. Spend you cash on another anime."
1,soft rock?????,"Anybody who thinks this is rock , must have rocks for brains . This is soft touch pop rock and not in rocks league, damn i have rockier toothpaste ."
2,Scroll Saw Projects,"I was expecting a more of ""How To Do"" book along with the projects. Mr. Nelson assumes that the person who is reading his book is primarily focused upon projects only, but without the experience or skill set the reader is really at the mercy of experimentation. sms"
3,ok book,I wasn't very pleased with the patterns in the book. They were all very similar. There were only a few patterns in the book that I actually liked.
2,A catch all that didn't.,"The book attempts to do what many photoshop books do, cram the basics, with some technique, throw in a bit of advanced stuff and leave you with a bit of everything in the end. A majority of the photos used in the book are average. Topics which I think are crucial to the art include colour accuracy, getting the best rom RAW images, calibration, output control. All these topics were lightly touched on with no real meaty goodness.The book feels suited towards the beginner, but I believe there are better choicesI think you'd be better of with Martin Evan's Photoshop for Photographers for a more focused, indepth book on the topic, and possibly a general book covering aspects of Photoshop, perhaps Real World Photoshop by Bruce Fraser."
5,Micheal Vartan an exceptional actor!,"What a great movie... love, romance, committment and unselfishness. Micheal you were just beautiful in everyway! Great story line and inspirational love story!"
4,Sensitively handled love story,"Very impressive romance with serious issues. Why isn't Peet a huge star already? She totally embodied this role. Vartan is gorgeous and charismatic and together they made a beautiful and heartwrenching couple.The dvd itself misses out on 5 stars because the EXTRAS promised on the box are not on the dvd itself. What happened to the Director's Commentary and the Music Soundtrack it states are part of the Special Features? I feel very cheated by this. There wasn't even a Special Features category; the interviews were a measly 30 seconds each and there were no language options.The packaging therefore is a lie and surely in the US this type of advertizing is illegal? However, the film itself is not to be missed."
3,Touch Me,Touch Me was interesting as well as educational. It educates people about protecting themselves against HIV/AIDS. I recommend it for couples dating.
1,Nada mucho aqui(not much here),"If you are looking for hot chicks with nice racks, dont look here! For the most part, a pretty lame story about a rich chick with saggy boobs using the hell out of a rather matured, one time husband of Melaine Griffith-- Steven Bauer. I watched the un-rated eddition and the R rated and there was almost no difference. So... the sex scenes are lame, the story is predictable, and the main characters are not that hot. However, in retrospect, the film did have Fred Dryer, you know..from that cop show, Hunter. And watching Steven Bauer turn red from sucking it in during his lame sex scenes is good for a giggle. Butr unless you are a die hard Steven Bauer fan, avoid this turkey!"
1,Waste of Time,"I found the plot of this story very weak and predictable. And, some of the missing details support this; i.e. they live in a huge mansion (at least that's what is shown as it is approached in a car), but there are never any servants present inside. Also, the mistress of this huge place wears clothes that certainly do not seem to be those of one of her economic status. There are lots of other inconsistences with the story line. Bottom line: movie is a waste of time!"
2,Mascara,Received it quicly. I am not thrilled with this mascara. Doesn't really lengthen or thicken. Stays on ok. Would not reccomend. Purchased by my wife.
5,delivery of thermasilk,I have used this product (Thermasilk Enchancing 2 in 1 shampoo plus conditioner) for years and could no longer find it on the shelves. Thanks for the super service in getting it to me.
1,Not Reliable,"Similar to others here, about 3 months after burning, an entire spindle of Maxell branded RICOHJPN-R01-002 went bad. They all developed a visible ring about 1/3 through the disc, & are unreadable after the first 1/3 by all my players (Philips 727, Asus , & Pioneer 8) (oddly except a Cyberhome 500 which reads them fine). I will NEVER knowing by Ricoh again."
3,Sony VF-67MP 67mm Multi-Coat Lens,"Costly, other filter will work just as well. But it does what it was made to do."
3,"This Should Be Titled ""Inspirational Story-Telling Songs""","This album should be titled ""Inspirational Story-Telling Songs"". If you are expecting singing you will be disappointed because this is an album of Spoken-Word Songs. However, if you are a Jimmy Dean fan and enjoy his stories and songs then this has a nice selection of tracks.Product is good but title is misleading if you don't know better."
5,I thought good jazz voices were extincted. Thank God they're not!,"Hey, I just thought that I have heard the best of jazz with Billie Holiday, but nooo... Jimmy Scott may be a good competition for her! His voice is hueart- breaking and melancholic. I love the feelings he transmits, and I personally recommend this album, because it has a long way history of his. Please pay special attention to his wonderful version of NOTHING COMPARES 2 U, just beautiful!"
2,Mostly re-hashed material experienced people already know,"I bought this book based on the smooth and slick packaging and because it appeared, on the surface, to offer a unique contribution to the CI knowledge base. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find that most of the material was already in the public domain and some of it was quite stale (example: the poor introductory chapter and Part 3 that was mostly borrowed from others). The field is clearly in trouble if this book represents the best that the self-promoted ""world's foremost corporate intelligence experts"" can come up with. Hopefully, they will provide us with better material that is likely to come out of subsequent consulting assignments that this book appears to be promoting."
2,Its okay,I found that after reading the book that all that I learnt could have been written in one chapter.The basic idea is good but I certainly did not learn very much.
4,Several good chapters,"The book has several chapters that make it worth purchasing. It has a good tradecraft discussion (on elicitation, body language, etc.) and the detailed description of the quarterback technique, denial and deception, and protection of trade secrets are all well done. The detailed analysis report on Aquila and Tacit Rainbow could have been left out without loss. Furthermore, the section on Cyber Collection is likely to be soon outdated, if not so already."
5,Excellent overview of competitive intelligence processes.,"Excellent description of competitive intelligence: its rationale, nature,tools and techniques. Includes a discussion of how warrooms enhance the competitive intelligence process. There are several useful case studies. The discussion of the Quarterback technique was especially good, along with instructions on how to build a competitive intelligence organization. The detailed bibliography is useful for gathering additional information on the topic."
5,Great Book!!!,"This book is a ""must-read"", it is sad at parts but I won't spoil the book for you!!! If you are looking for a great book read this, you should also read the sequel Turtle On A Fence Post, it is also great! The Man Who Loved Clowns is about Delrita, a girl who's uncle ""Punky"" just turned 35 years old, he has down-syndrome.I won't tell you any more but trust me READ THIS BOOK!!!"
3,good book,this was a good book i loved all the chactrers espically punky. however i must warn you to keep a kneelex box handy when you read this.
3,background information about Down syndrome possibilities is dated,"While the story itself is valuable--the difficulties of dealing with family upheavals for a teenaged girl--its focus on Down syndrome would lead to erroneous conclusions about the treatment and education of people with Down syndrome. Education has come a long way since the setting of this book, and employment in many situationsis now possible. The Down syndrome character in this book is very limited, which is a misleading impression. At the time the book was written, it may have been more accurate."
5,Relevant Today,"The story and the subject matter are very relevant to the problems of discrimination and bullying in today's world. The story itself is bittersweet. It is a pity that it is not on the current reading list. As an adult reading a middle-school book, I was very impressed and will past it on to a granddaughter of that age range. The book itself was ragged and worn, discarded from a mid-West school where it was apparently enjoyed again and again. I ordered the book because of research that I am doing on clowns."
5,A must read book,"A wonderful story about a young girl and her uncle that will absoluetly touch your heart. There are many lessons tought in this book. If you havent read it yet, make sure you do soon!"
4,Great,"This book shows how it really doesn't matter what other pople think. It also shows that being a part of a crowd can sometimes hurt, but friends always make it better. People with mental disabilities can be just as loving and caring, if not more so, than your ""average"" person. I really liked this book, and recommend it to anyone in the mood for laughter, tears, and an all around good story."
1,Disappointed,I use Angel perfume daily but the bottle I ordered does not smell like what I buy from Macy's. I think it is watered down.
4,Angelic scent!,"I ripped the page off a magazine, that had the scent of Angel. I kept it on my bedside table, and it gave off such a delicious fragrance. I knew I HAD to buy it. I started checking it on google and Amazon had the best price on it. Now I use it every day, although I have many perfumes. Since I received it, it's the ONLY one I use on a daily basis. I love it. It's a youthfulul scent, very delicate. And the bottle itself is very attractive too, I recomment it highly. It's something I will definitely buy for gifts to my friends,"
1,Angel Parfum,This is my favorite Parfum now. My husband suggested it and he made a wise choice. So sexy smelling to him which I love.I've gotten many compliments on it.
5,Cindy Bonner Triumphs Once Again,"This book is just as incredible as her first, ""Lily"". It's a wonder to me that Cindy Bonner doesn't get more recognition for her work. Her novels are honest, with real, human characters. This book, as well as her two previous, is a book I will never forget!"
5,Loved this!,"I loved this product. I just started knitting and i thought this was very helpful. It came with two needles, directions and enough yarn to make a scarf. The container is the cutest slurpee cup! The directions were easy to follow and the colors were all very pretty. I bought the purple and it was shades of light and dark pinks and purples. Even if you make a few boo-boos, the colored yarn makes it hard to tell. I also bought the mint, and it is so pretty as well. I highly reccomend for new knitters, or as a give for a new knitting teen or tween."
4,cool cup o' yarn,I really thought this was a cute idea and wasnt disappointed when it arrived. Very simple to understand and really cool yarn to choose from. I would definately recommend if you are interested in making a simple scarf.
5,Nice compilation; Messed up track list,"Great sax from Barbara Thompson. The Live version of ""Little Annie Ooh"" is especially nice, but be warned, the track listing is messed up, so I'm talking about Track 3. Track 2 is actually ""City Lights,"" Track 3 is ""Little Annie Ooh"" and Track 4 should be ""Fields of Flowers."" I wasn't familiar with the cut ""Fear of Spiders,"" but if it's actually included, it must be Track 5. The tracks after that are as printed. The mess up isn't just with Amazon's list, it's also messed up in Gracenotes (used by iTunes) and on the back cover of the album/CD. How do I know this? I own a lot of other Barbara Thompson CD's, as well as a lot of The United Jazz + Rock Ensemble where she's a member, and some of her songs are on those other albums."
4,Fast and Fun Indeed,I thoroughly enjoyed learning from this book. I bought it so I can make conversational speaking in French for my coming trio to Montreal. It didn't disappointm. I was able to learn the fast and easy way.
1,French,"The book had a terrible odour, and I could hardly bare to use it. It must have been in someones basement for years.I keep it outdoors it literally smells up the whole room.Very disappointed"
1,Definitely NOT for beginners,"the CD only covered half of displayed scopes of the pronunciation and lessons,I don't get the logic why they do things this way"
3,Not as easy as it looks,It's ok Kinda dissapointed...Does not really start at the beginning with alphabet and such..goes too fast..does not speak very clearly.....
1,irritating,I had this book for several years and would periodically try to learn French from it but would always give up. I then purchased a different book (Living Language 3 set series) and had much more success. This book skips around too much. It tosses in a fair amount of intermediate French that just serves to confuse and frustrate a beginner. I ended up giving it away.
5,Learn French the Fast and Fun Way,My book actually was shipped from Dailybooksales at a discounted (very good) price. It arrived in a timely manner and in new condition. I was very pleased with the transaction. NDLearn French the Fast and Fun Way (Fast & Fun)
4,Detailed biography of an idealist poltician,"This detailed biography of a mainly forgotten character of the nineteenth century will be especially attractive to students interested the critical years in America following the Civil War. Some persons at the time thought Donnelly a crackpot, but he founded a small city, served six terms in the U.S. Congress, wrote five or six books that astounded the nation, more than any other single person founded the People's Party, and drafted platform documents with premises that today are adopted in the rhetoric of both major political parties."
2,A ton of errors in this book,"Viel was a great man, but there are way too many errors in this Clay Giants book. The second and third editions were suppose to correct the errors made in the first book. All have great pictures, just don't believe everything you read and take it all with a grain of salt."
2,NOT SO GREAT,"ALTHOUGH THIS BOOK WASN'T TERRIBLE, IT WASN'T GREAT EITHER. IT WAS A LITTLE STRANGE. I HAVE NEVER READ A TRUE CRIME BOOK THAT GOES IT TO AS MUCH DETAIL AS THIS ONE DID CONCERNING THE PROSECUTOR. I ENDED UP SKIPPING MOST OF THAT PART. NOT ONLY DID IT GO ON ABOUT HIS CHILDHOOD, BUT IT ALSO INCLUDED CHILDHOOD PICTURES. WHO CARES? PERHAPS THE AUTHOR COULD NOT MAKE THE BOOK AS LONG AS HE WANTED, SO HE THREW IN TRIVIAL DETAILS."
3,slow moving at times,"I GOT THE CHARACTERS MIXED-UP. IT WAS UNUSUAL FOR THE TELLING OF CONWAY'S LIFE, BUT VERY INTERESTING. I DIDN'T THINK THIS BOOK WAS ALL THAT GREAT FOR A TRUE CRIME BOOK."
2,Not so sure about this one,"The price is awesome for the sound it COULD put out. The thumped pretty alright. I had it in a .32cuft sealed enclosure, which is way too small. It put out a decent amount of bass regardless. The second you open it, you can tell how cheaply the sub is put together. Impressive surround size. I had it on a 300wattMAX amp and it blew in a couple days. Completely toasted one coil and the other one read .3 ohm. It was not even thumped on in the slightest bit. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,runs small,"based on the sizing on the site we ordered a small for our 8 lb chihuahua.. but it was still too small. Our little girl is a bit muscular, so it didnt fit around her chest. - we ended up giving it away. :(Super cute though and made very well! Just wish it had fit!"
1,Not as good as the title makes it sound...,"This is a bloody fantasy novel dealing with the Celts, ancient Mycenae and Crete (called Atlantis in this book). None of the characters are sympathetic, the swordplay is at times pointless, and the plot is unengaging. The writer's contention is that old Santorini was Atlantis (the Atlanteans are made to be the bad guys), and, if that is not bad enough, he has one of his professor friends adamantly backing up the claim in the epilogue of the book. That dry husk of an observation aside, this is the kind of book that speed reading was invented for. Why Atlantis even had to be included in the title was beyond me, other than to sell more copies."
2,Didn't like it.,"I've been scrolling for 2 years on my DeWalt and have come to admire Nelson's basket designs. However, this book is lame. It doesn't feature the crisp detail that I expect from his designs. They look a lot more like they were drawn freehand. There are also some designs that have been recycled from magazine and other books he has contributed to. This book isn't worth the price for the number of worthwhile designs."
1,Deceptive Title,"The title of this book should be ""Writing to Change the World (for Leftists)"". Then I wouldn't have bought it, mistakenly thinking it was about writing. Mary Pipher inserts her political views and agenda throughout, in a self-righteous and judgmental manner. She is stuck in the '60's, with cultural heroes such as Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan and Janis Jopllin, among the other usual suspects.In one particularly mean-spirited screed, she accuses ""Mr. America"" (commonly known as Uncle Sam) of being an arrogant middle-aged white man, who is also an Evangelical Christian, and who needs therapy in order to foster a world community (of her liking). She seems to have no room for people of a moderate conservative bent, which is easily half of America.This author is still ""blowin' in the wind"" (and windy she is!) If you want a book on WRITING, I would recommend Steven King's ""On Writing."" Regardless of his political philosophy, he has respect for a wide audience and doesn't stereotype people."
1,"Change Writers = Die Hard, Lockstep Liberals","Rule number one in writing for change, according to Mary Pipher, is that you must be a die-hard, lockstep liberal. You must hate ""The Man"" (i.e. George W. Bush). You must recycle everything. You must fight such things as deforestation and global warming. You must NOT fight such things as political correctness or parenting by village. I will admit, I barely made it through half of this book. But that was because I got tired of being preached at. Pipher needs to check her own politics and ideals at the door and live by her own words: ""I don't want to belong to any club that won't have everyone as a member."" Well, Mary, I'm afraid that ""everyone"" includes conservatives, Republicans, and even conservative Republicans. Every once in a while, we middle-class white males might have a good idea ourselves. But if we listen to what Pipher preaches, we may give up on expressing it. I strongly advise against the purchasing of this book."
4,Talkingpolitics.com,this book is an excellent start about politics and feel talkingpolitis.com is another great place to continue the conversation
1,Way over-rated,"Hertzberg has had a history of poking fun of people who have set lofty ideals of personal character and societal morality. Those who try to have these accepted as norms, inevitably have their ideals lampooned when it's shown that they're impossible to attain or sustain. Thus we have Limbaugh's drug addiction, Bennett's gambling habit, priestly buggery, etc.Hertzberg and his ilk never fail to use the weight of the fallen idealist to smash the moral underpinnigs of society. This is flawed logic. It will never work, not as long as there are good people and people to aspire to be good. What's the alternative? Hendrick Hertzberg has never thought about what the success of his goals would mean. Would the world be better off?"
4,A very good read,"After reading all the reviews I thought I would give my own. To the cynics, this book wasn't meant to be Shakespeare, it was meant to give one an escape and to lighten one's heart. That's what it did for me. This book was very well written, I could see everything the author described. I only wish Maggie hadn't waited so long to go to Eliot. I didn't try to compare this book with Bridges, the two stories are different, and shouldn't be compared. I liked the story, and read it in one day, like others, I just couldn't put it down. After I read the book, I found myself thinking of my own first love, and what would've happened if I had stayed with him. I am going to read other books the author has written under both names. I'm sure they will be just as good. Thank you Catherine Pelliter (aka K. C. McKinnon) for writing this beautiful book!"
4,I really enjoyed this book,"It is set in an area I am very familiar with, and love. McKinnon sets the scenes so well, you feel you are there. I loved it."
4,A good read.,"I really enjoyed this book - almost loved it. It was a quick read and the author easily draws you into a beautiful and serene setting along with memories of first love that we all have. My only criticism -- and maybe I'm a little too ""New England"" prudish -- would be the almost incestuous-feeling love that develops between Maggie and Eliot. I can accept the age difference, but falling for the son of my first love who looks just like him ... I don't know ... feels a little weird and I had a tough time shaking that feeling. But, the drawings, the writing, the setting all were enough to pull me in and keep me reading to the end."
1,Ugh! The Worst Book I've Ever Read,"I bought this book thinking it would be a touching love story, but it was unbelievable and boring. The writing seemed rushed and rough-hewn, like the author hadn't spent a lot of time polishing. The author's comtempt for the genre was obvious. It was almost like she sat down and said, ""I'm writing these wonderful, underrated literary novels, and it's getting me nowhere! Nobody has ever heard of Cathie Pelletier! And I want to be famous more than life itself, so I'll just whip up another BRIDGES and those stupid romance readers will rush out and buy it. Then all of my respected literary novels will get read, and I'll finally get my just rewards."" If you want a good love story, read an author who has love and respect for her characters (and doesn't look down on her audience). I can't recommend this book to anyone. What a disappointment!"
1,Yuch!,"I listened to the audiotape of this book. The reader did the best she could with the incredibly cornball dialogue and trite descriptions, but it was still barely tolerable.If I heard the words ""Little Bear Lake"" and ""Robert Flaubert"" one more time I would have screamed. Who told the author that constant repetition was a GOOD thing? Somehow she must have the idea that it is somehow romantic to constantly repeat names and places.Not only is the story trite and predictable, but the bigger than life protagonist and his idolicized dead father are annoying as hell. If Robbie was so perfect then why on earth did Maggie dump him? And the wize words that come out of 25-year-old Elliot's mouth are ludicrous. Quoting the Great Gatsby? How pretentious!Romance followers will still probably swoon over this pap, but literature lovers will barf."
5,"a memory ""stirrer""","the book was warm, soft and lovely! it brought back memories of my highschool days and dancing at ""Birch Point"" in Island falls, Maine.I am an older woman and this is the first romance story i've read in years.A story of ""recapturing youth"". everyone needs a little of this in their busy lives today."
1,I thought I would enjoy this book ~,"When I first starting reading this book, I knew it was made into a movie as I was reading it then I remember I did see the movie. I think I would have love this book if the plot was different, I couldn't get pass the fact that, Maggie fell in love with her first love's son it wasn't the age difference, I wouldn't mind if she fell in love with a younger guy not having nothing to do with her first love son's sorry this book didn't do it for me."
5,HARVEST MOON was a great book!,"I loved this book, it touched my heart and made me cry. Not many books could touch the heart the way Harvest Moon touched mine. It shows true love really does exist and you find it when you least expect to."
4,"Very touching,heartfelt",Dancing at The Harvest Moon is a great book.Once I started I couldnt put it down! I laughed and I cried and I told all of my friends to read it!
3,calendar facts 365,Bought for my 16 year old son who lives with ESPN 24/7. He thought it was cool. Myself I thought it could have been better.
1,"The sport ""fact"" on the cover is grossly inaccurate.","I got this for Christmas and recently opened it up to put on my desk. Right there on the cover of the box was a fact about Yankee Aaron Small. It said in 2005, Small had 10 straight Wins in his first 10 major league appearances.Great fact, except for the fact that it's completely untrue. Small debuted in the majors in 1994! The Yankees were his 7th team! And it took him 15 appearances in 2005 before he reached his 10th win of that season.Makes you wonder how reliable the rest of the calendar is when the cover fact isn't even remotely true."
5,"This is an enjoyable, quick read--and there's no moral!","I received this as a present, waited a few months, and then read it in the course of a single day. This short play is about a middle-class businessman whose biggest anxiety revolves around the Firebugs, men in the city who are responsible for a recent rash of arsons. They enter homes as guests and, after staying the night or dining, take advantage of their hosts' hospitality and trust and burn down their homes. The protagonist, at the height of such crimes, allows a couple of young men to spend the night at his house and refuses to believe (because of pride or trust or some other variable) that the sawdust, matches, and gasoline that they bring into his attic could have anything to do with malicious intents. Frisch prevents the reader from really feeling sorry for the protagonist, who is humorously pathetic. The most interesting part, to me, is that what seems at first glance to be a caricature of human nature is, in fact, so close to reality."
5,Basin-Plateau Aboriginal Sociopolitical Groups,"Steward's most descriptive work for his cultural ecology model, based on extensive study of paleo-indian technology and environment. Contains some of dry statistics, but I found the contextual-functionist theory made clear by Steward's models and data. This is an absolute must for any student of american anthropology and archaeology."
5,The definative story of A Night At The Opera!!! An all-time classic!!!,"This is the story of one of the greatest albums of all time!!! This is the making of the Queen classic: A Night At The Opera!!! Featues li=ots of great footage,interviews etc!!! Chock full of great information about this classic album!!! Includes the original 50 minute program as well as 50 minutes of additional footage!!! A welcome addition to your Queen DVD library!!! Recommended at the price!!! A+"
4,becoming a classic,"Joyce illustrates a place and time that never quite is or was. This book is one more installment in the history and current events of that nearly-America, not to mention an invaluable reference should you need to turn your Baby Brother into an elephant..."
1,"ridicilous, How does this stuff ever get published.",This book is ridicilous. It is a waste of money. I don't see how any publisher would ok it. I returned it. NOT worth the money or any at all. Save the trees with this one. The Author must know somebody or have an in somehow. Don't waste money on it. No lesson in it.
4,"Fun, fun, fun!","Darling book, gorgeous illustrations! The story so many kids fantasize comes to life in this lovely little story book. Enjoy!"
5,Wonderful first book for toddlers!,"This book, especially the child size version-- perfect for little hands, was charming from the moment I picked it up, months before my child was even a twinkle in my eye. Now she is two years old, and she never tires of reading her favorite bedtime story. She can now recite the story verbatim. The illustrations are remarkable and my child can spend hours talking about the small details in the pictures that leave me marveling at both the illustrator and my toddler. I hope everyone has a chance to enjoy this book as much as we do."
4,Perfect,"This book was a great compliment to my treatment. Cancer is scary enough without having to try to decifer what takes physcicians 10 years to learn. The information in this ""how to"" type book, was consice to the point and covered a wide range of information including sexual problems and alternative medicines. I especially like the ""workbook"" at the end. No pull at the heartstring stories nor any ""filler"". Just good, easy to read information including where to get more information if so inclined. I would recommend this book to EVERYONE who has cancer or knows someone else with cancer.Great information with none of the ""scary"" stuff."
1,"NOT AS ADVERTISED!!!!! 1, NOT 3!!!!!","The ad clearly states that this price is for 3 of this lipstick, not only the 1 I received. The only reason I ordered is that the price listed was good value. When the listed price plus shipping is higher than I ever paid in the store, it becomes a ripoff. I will not order from this seller again.[...]Scroll down to ""Product Description"" where it clearly states ""3 pack."""
5,Great bit of bling for my V Star,This is a nice piece of chrome accent for my v star 650. Can not go wrong with Kuryakyn accessories. Fast shipping by Powersports Superstore and great price as I have become accustom to from this excellent retailer
3,When it works it works well.,"I have had this pruner/clipper for a few years. When it works, it works well. However the use of a chain with the cutting system was a bad idea. The chain can jump its track and you spend a lot of time trying to get it unjammed and back on track. Especially when using where there may be many small branches or leaves than can get stuck in the mechanism. (those that use a rope all the way up seem like they would have less chance of getting stuck) Also some people I have loaned it too can't seem to work the twist system to elongate the pole. The unit is kinda heavy, so when elongated, it will be very hard to hold and control. But when you can get a branch in the U, it's a gonner. It cuts well and can get some very thick tough branches. I never used the saw part as it was too heavy to really use that as high up as I needed."
4,Good handy tool,Arrived not properly assembled (the fasteners were not tightened properly) so I lost a nut while using the tool. Second day of use the spring got sprung (? don't know why). I called Customer Service (very friendly and prompt) and received the replacement parts in time for the next weekends projects. Since that time there have been no problems.
4,Twice the price and worth it.,"Very well constructed. Doesn't slip but is a bit heavy. Of course the more vertical you use it the less the weight and flex matter. It doesn't flex much either. I was surprised at how much the extra 1/4 inch throat capacity mattered. The hook and blade are much stronger than the 1"" model sold for 40 bucks. And, 1"" branches are easy to cut. The saw is very sharp too. It is very easy to use. The loss of one point is because the chain has a tendency to flip and lock up in a closed loop. I am not sure anything can be done about that. I may try a floating piece of steel tubing over it some day. Anyhow; If you want something to last, this is it. A little WD-40 after every use and I bet this will last a lifetime of homeowner use."
2,"If you don't understand already, this book doesn't help.","After reading this book, I still didn't know how to insert an e-mail address or jpeg into my web page. It did not provide step-by-step direction and certainly did not help you when things don't work as easily as the book claims. Not as good as the QuarkXPress Quickstart. A waste of money. I had to go back and find another book. Langer also has an annoying habit of writing ""I discuss topic X in chapter X"" every other sentence, which splatters you all over the book when you're trying to research a problem."
5,Reliable for safely transporting my kayak.,"I use cross straps when transporting my kayak, but added these for some additional piece of mind. As far as I'm concerned you can never be too careful when you have a 56 lbs. kayak on your roof on the highway. These ratchet and tie down easily, are secure, and come from a brand name I trust. I've had them for about 2 years and they show no signs of wear, fading, or abuse despite inevitably banging them around a bit."
2,Its horrible,"OK this is JOEY LAWRENCE....i mean come on he can act but his singin ability?Ok i have heard...better voices but i have heard worse...Joey has a one good song on here its ""Never gonna change my mind"" I dont really own this cd but i have heard it i mean if u like joey lawrence i say add it to your collection but if ur just curious and wanna hear good music this is not somthing u wanna buy mayb a listen or 2 woulden't hurt but please do not buy this its really basically besides one song pretty much junk"
4,A standout sparkeling effort by America's teenage prodigy,"Joey Lawrence's music career has long been ignored but ""Soul mates"" shows just how versital the loveable ""Joey"" on Blossom can be. I'd imagine most fans of Joey's don't remember but from ealy childhood under the tutelage of Nell Carter he really developed a fine voice. Nell's influence can really be heard in Joey's Ven Ven Conmigo. If you haven't heard this CD yet you really should; you won't be disapointed."
4,LAWRENCE MAKES REALLY GOOD POP.,"Joey Lawrence, this kid has looks, body, voice and rhythm. Why did this album fail at radio and sales? I am baffled.When mindless trash like LFO and Eminem are hitting the charts and selling records Lawrence who has all the rhythms, dance beats, and ballads to make the perfect pop album fails.His first single ""Never Gonna Change My Mind"" hit club play, but never surfaced on the radio, probably because he is Joey Lawrence (stigma)....just like Deborah (Debbie) Gibson who keeps putting out wonderful material every couple of years has difficulty due to (stigma)....Soon that will happen to Mandy, Britney and Jessica too.Other standout songs include ""Ven Ven Conmigo"" and ""Time"". Quite a tasty treat of pop, and Lawrence can sing with the best of them....too bad it didn't catch on."
2,Disappointed,"As a long time ISB fan, I looked forward to this DVD in hope of recapturing the ISB glory days. But while this disk has a couple of good performances, much of the disk is devoted to a silly high-schoolish skit/movie that captures the playfulness of the time, but not the true magic.Also the film says its 80 minutes, but this includes a half hour, longwinded review with the director who explains that this didn't make the cut with BBC, even though they paid for it.All in all, there's maybe 10 to 15 minutes of quality concert footage and the rest is a kind of avant garde digression."
1,Pure Garbage,"I have loved The Incredible String Band ever since Jonathan Swartz first played ""First Girl I Loved"" on WNEW-FM, back in the 1960's. They were an amazing part of the dream that was the world back then. BUT THIS DVD SUCKS, 100%. Rent it from Netflix first, and you will see what I mean. What a despicable way to show anything about ISB...it is filled with fluff and fibs all the way through."
3,Missing something,"This book has several good things going for it.A really interesting concept.Great Title, and (intriguing) Cover.A useful format.But...While the style of writing covers a teenage range of understanding the presentation style seems geared for pre-teens, it actually represents a half-way ground that I'm afraid neither will find satisfying.A shame because this kind of book might find a really receptive audience in the home schoolers market. I encourage anyone who wants to grow reasoning skills in their teens and pre-teens to take a look, but it might fail to grab you as it did me."
1,Pale print,"very very disappointed with this purchase, it looks so cheap and the print was so pale. there is depthness in the dimension of the picture scale. Not highly recommended."
3,Phone drops calls,"I liked this phone for the clarity. It has great reception, however the phone will disconnect you while your talking. I'm not sure why, but while I was on a conversation, it hung up on the person I was speaking with. The phone did this three times in a row until I gave up & used my cell phone."
2,Faulty ni-cad batteries,We've had these phones for about six months and the battery life on one is about two minutes and the other is about four minutes. I've had plenty of phones that have ni-cad batteries so I doubt that they have developed these memories from short phone calls. Makes me wonder if they are factory seconds that got shipped unmarked.
1,Disappointed,These hooks are for small ornaments only and to hang 9 ornaments seemed to be too cluttered. Also be aware that you are purchasing a set of two. I would have preferred to pay less money for one than more money for two. To return this cost a lot of money in postage. $8 plus dollars added to the original purchase price plus the cost of return. I was disappointed.
4,"Fair, Clear, and Not Terrible at All","Shirley Nelson's _Fair, Clear, and Terrible: The Story of Shiloh_ is one of those rare history books that's plotted and executed more like a mystery novel than a documentary. Nelson, whose parents met at Shiloh, took an interest in the site at a young age, and thus grew up always in its shadow. Through the years she gathered as much information as she could, and reports on it all here. However, this isn't just a regurgitation of the facts. Nelson's family ties to the place give her, it would seem, a reason to write about it with more heart than most historians, coupled with a sardonic, not-quite-suppressed sarcasm that leaves the reader laughing on occasion. And when was the last time you laughed at a HISTORY book?A wonderful piece of work. Highly recommended."
3,Monster Trucks,The Videos are the history of Bigfoot from the first car crushing action to racing action ending at about 1990. These are great videos for collectors and big fans of Bigfoot the legend.There is some great old footage that we had never seen before.However the videos lack the polish of todays technology and graphics so be prepared for some shortcomings in production.My 21 month old Son loves the videos and he watches them over and over. So if you have a toddler who loves trucks these are a good investment. If you don't really care about quality at least you get quantity in three videos.
1,IT'S TIME TO GET REAL!,"NOT ON DVD? YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. RIGHT I'LL WATCH THIS ON VHSAND AT THIS PRICE? WAKE UP, SOMEONE RELEASE ALL SEASONS ON DVD ANDMAKE SOME MONEY."
4,So Many Miles,"From the flyleaf:""'I don't know what's to become of you two girls if you can't win some millionaire. You're both damned good-lookers, but that's all. If it ever came to making yourselves useful, God help you both.'Her father's dying words kept on ringing in Sondra's ears as she realized that the luxuries were gone and that she was helpless and penniless.Flora did marry wealth, and Sondra had the constant spectacle of her boredom, but was love enough? Sondra loved Mark Merriman - but could she ever be happy on his meagre income? How she tried to bargain for luxury and secretly cling to happiness, and finally learned that there can be no halfway with love, makes this one of Ruby Ayres's most appealing romances."""
3,Gary...Legend or Hoax?,"Actually, IMHO, he's neither.Lejendary Adventures is a mixed bag. The rules light (we're talking baby air elemental light here) game has a definite unique flair to it? Takes a lot to create a game that basically has very little gaming rules. Definitely not for the girly-man RPG'ers.If you're heavy into rules and fantasy-as-reality RPG (basically anyone who LOVES the 3rd edition D&D system), this is definitely NOT something for you...trust me...even Gary has said so!Being someone who has not fallen into the category of a Gary-phile, my main critcism of this product is the packaging. Unlike some of my more scholarly counterparts seem to subscribe to, this book was NOT an easy read by any means. Maybe it's because I'm one of those sissy boys who love D&D...but the fonts alone caused me to wish for the days of DCS and DSL art.A lot of promise, but far from a complete product. Then again, maybe that's what Mr. Gygax intended."
5,Great Companion for Flashing Steel,"This is a great companion DVD forFlashing Steel, 2nd edition: Mastering Eishin-Ryu Swordsmanship.It covers Nukitsuke, Furikaburi, Kirioroshi, Chiburi, Noto, Tameshigiri. It also has two 2 person exercises.Production values are first rate, the demonstrations are masterful, and the voice ""acting"" is acceptably good."
2,Not Amazing.,"Regrettably I own this DVD, One would expect that at a price tag of $20+ you would receive a bit more applicable information.I was expecting instruction. The presentation is good but could have used a fair bit more polish. The individuals making the presentation I believe were knowledgeable but lack a bit of organization.(camera spooked) If your goal is to differentiate between similar basic maneuvers then you wont be disappointed. If you goal is to find several practicable forms then it is lacking, Accurate, but lacking.(Now i hope they don't show up and chop me in half..;)"
4,Computer reapir kit,"With this kit I now have the versatility I need in working on my computers, I not not need to search for several differnt items. This kit has all the tools neccessary for me to fix what problems may arise with my computers. I am happy with this product.John"
3,no instructions,"I never had an antenna topper before. I wasn't sure how to install it. sure would have been nice if it had some instructions! Sure, I figured it out - I had to pre-drill it (hand held drill) so it would fit my thick stubby antenna, then twisted it on. seems to be staying on all right after a month or so."
5,Cuts Through Gore Spin,"Saunders takes a cool look into what she calls ""Goredom."" The results are illuminating. Gore seems to be a man who will say anything to be president. He will betray any constituency. Perhaps Saunders' most shocking point is that rather than flip-flopping on abortion, as he now admits to having done, Gore always intended to switch to a pro choice position after moving out of the House of Representatives and toward national leadership. Saunders also proves that his environmental bark is far worse than his bite.Easy to read and understand, this book is well worth reading by anyone who is undecided in this election."
2,clarification,"not sure some people that read this realize that the author of this book is not the same who wrote the Kushiel fantasy series. So, if you think they are the same person, you will be greatly disappointed."
2,Not enjoyable,"I was so looking forward to this book after reading a ""literary"" review but was so disappointed. The premise was good but the book didn't deliver. I stuck with it to the end, but it didn't help."
2,Is this even the same author?,"I had read Carey's other books (the Kushiel trilogy, and Banewreaker) and was completely delighted with them. Figuring that a good author generally doen't put out a bad book, I picked this one up. Well, now I have learned better.This book is painfully dissapointing. Sunny is written like a caricature of that friendly girl in high school who solved everybody's problems by putting her ankles behind her ears. Bridget is written like a ghost long before she's actually dead. Jean is almost a saving grace, but it's too little too late.Don't waste your time. This author is a wonderful writer, just not in this book. I feel like I just bought a Maria Callas recording, only to hear her yodeling on the disc."
2,Maybe I was reading a different book...,"... than the reviewers. I found this to be pseudo-literary, interiorly-focused drivel. While the premise was somewhat interesting [the reason for the second star] I found the writing as annoying as that of Erica Jong, who turns out the same kind of cutesy closet philosophy and know-it-all narrative.Yuck. Stick with genre BDSM, Jacqueline."
4,very good rural psychedelia,"It's a really good example of the evolution of psychedelia in the early 70's, a bit like dino valente-era QMS, but more dynamic, with suberb guitar solos.Not all the tracks are good, but enough to recommend it, plus the sound of the CD is excellent.If you like the Wizards from Kansas or Mountain Bus, go for it!"
1,LED light,"The lamp is very dim. I am very disappointed in it. Not worth the money. The suction cups also do not fit the feet of the lamp very well, so I don't think it would adhere reliably to most surfaces. I also still have not been able to get the battery case open...it's cheap plastic. Would have returned it by now, but have been busy with the holidays."
1,Yamaha Rain Pants,"not worth the price, very heavy, very large (xx size)takes forever to receive (2 weeks) never again!"
3,Interesting voices,"Although not a comprehensive listing of the ladies who sing with the band, this is certainly a good enough effort to receive three stars in my estimation. I did enjoy reading the text and I'm sure that I will keep referring to it from time to time. Well done."
2,Mediocre Performance,This performance of Jaques Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld was to say the least and at best - simply mediocre. It plays like a high school band rendition and thus is something of a disappointment.The titles to the various portions of the music are in German with no English translations and thus so I have no idea of what I am listening to. I am really disappointed with this cd.
5,Kiki-a great character!,"What a wonderful character, Ms. Miller has created in Kiki! Girls can relate to her spunk and her tendency towards mischief. Great modern fiction for young girls to read!"
4,Consider Reading.,"I would suggest this book to many others but I have to say, it wasn't all that great. Near the middle I felt the author was adding unneeded excess information so she could fill a gap in her book. Otherwise, I found the book fairly entertaining. Please consider reading."
4,"Four French woman rock, good start on LP1","Plastiscines are a French rock band all female, Some of the songs on the cd are in French. Its was there first studio lp, They sound punkish or a part of Pretenders sound it some ways. Two guitars, bass and drums is all you will hear on this cd. Pure band playing together. I would download one or two songs to see if this is something you like. They have another newer album called About Love. The songs are more polished and have a bigger sound to them. It think they are very good rock and roll with a fast beat. Some of the stand out songs are, Mister Driver, No Way, Tu As Tout Prevu, Lost In Translation. This album is from 2007, The newer one, About Love is 2010. Good songs here."
1,Horrible...really,"There is a great review on Amazon France about this record, where the guy says they are even less pretty than his hairdresser. You have to read it! It is so true! This is one of the worst records ever. These girls have no talent, cannot play their instruments and the record is really sloppily produced. What was amazing is the extraordinary reviews this record recieved in the French press. I know that French rock has not allways been great but this is really horrible. It is obvious the guys at the French rock magazines find them cute (Ok, they kind of are). I repeat myself, this is amazingly bad, really and in that sense deserves to be heard...or not."
3,Cheesy but a well done documentary!,Ive had this movie for a long time. I have to be honest in saying that I watch this movie most of the time when I am trying to go to sleep...lol. Orson Wells does a good job of keeping you entertained throughout the movie. There are some funny characters in this doc such as a wild eyed funny chef on the ship named Al that is picked on and for good reason. As well as a wolfman hairy looking crew member. I was impressed by the scientists that are seen in this doc and their efforts to find the Titanic. I believe they came close to finding it however with the rough weather and constant problems with the sonar they might of had a chance.
3,"Another Rolling Stone ""eulogy"" for an icon","The best thing about Rolling Stone's compilation their coverage of Nirvana and Kurt Cobain is that it is one stop shopping. You can get just about everything published in RS abour Kurt and the band up until Kurt's death. Convienent? Yes. Informative? Well, considering Kurt rarely told the truth in interviews (for whatever reason) this book isn't going to give you alot you don't already know. The pictures are pretty lame - most of them were highly published during Nirvana's reign as the biggest band in the world. So, what makes Rolling Stone's collection so special? Because it's from Rolling Stone, the musical authority. If anything it's more of a coffee table book, especially with the dark, flattering picture of Cobain on the cover. Unfortunately, this is another way for corporate America to take advantage of a great artist, a great person who left this life too soon...You'd be better off with something other than this book."
3,more factual than really getting into who Kurt was,"I definetly thought this book was very good. A compilation of interviews with Kurt, Courtney, and their close friends, ""Cobains"" was a timeline of Kurt's life and the circumstances leading to, eventually, his suicide. However, the book states things very arbitrarily and doesn't really delve into or analyze the facts. It just sort of coldly, without emotion, talks about his life and death. Personally, being a lover of both Kurt and his music, I would have preferred to see something writen by someone who was more personally connected to him and at least could feel the sorrow and emotion that his music evoked and his suicide caused."
1,Oh what a pretty book,"If you want a pretty view of cobain read this. I think I've read 4 bio's on Kurt. This book makes him normal, just a guy with some pain and an alienation problems, so he does lots of drugs and kills himself. How romantic. A more realistic read is Christopher Sandfords Kurt Cobain. It ain't pretty but it reads honest."
5,You should buy this book,"This is one of the best books I have read about Kurt Cobain and Nirvana. It has interviews with Krist, Dave,and Kurt. It has some really cool pictures in it, too! I don't know if they think Kurt's death was murder or suicide though. Very well written and worth my money! If you are thinking about buying this book I have 2 words for you: BUY IT! This book is for any Kurt Cobain and Nirvana fan!"
5,much better,"this book really lets you get to know Cobain a lot better than ""Heavier than heaven"" did. In that books the facts are inaccuarte and you can't tell where the facts end and where the authors opinions begin. This is much better, a great read. Buy this instead of ""heavier than heaven""now that you know about the man learn more about his death; there is so much that you don't know and sadly it's all true. justiceforkurt.comthis site will change your life..."
1,Terribly bound book. Fell completely apart during 1st read.,"The content of the book was interesting, but the book itself is terribly bound together. It is a large paperback book that hold its pages to the spine with glue. I got about 6 pages into it when I noticed the pages I had turned started to feel loose. By the time I was about a quarter through, half the pages I had read completely fell out of the book. By the end, I had thrown the empty spine of what was a book to the side, and was just reading the individual pages that I had to keep in order as they fell out. At least the pages were made of recycled paper, so I felt better about recycling the book than just throwing it away. Honestly, I'd rather have saved the money and not bought it though."
3,All right if you don't know much about Harry Potter.,"The author has some interesting ideas, and some that are way out there. The book was an interseting read, but I was very distracted by all the facts that she got wrong. It was hard to take someone's theories seriously who didn't even get some of the house colors right."
2,A disappointing read.,"Having read the series twice and wanting to compare notes with a more astute ""detective"", I was disappointed with the lack of solid new ideas and the authors weak attemps at prognostication. For a high school project (A+) For a professional (D)."
3,Pretty Dig Dang Cool,"The Cons:1) The title is a bit misleading. This is not a San Francisco Blues Festival live album. Some of the artists here have obvious Bay Area connections but not all2) The meager Liner Note (singular, not plural) says that these recordings were made for US college radio or at campus concerts in the late 60's, early 70's. There is no information on where, when, why the individual recordings were made.The Pros:1) This is pretty good stuff. Not super exciting but not a bum track here2) Taj, Hooker and Hammond give typical knockout performances and the rest are no slouches either. Elvin Bishop smokes and The Airplane, Commander Cody and others are very enjoyable.3) The recording quality is better than I expected throughout, very listenableThis is a blues album that won't change your life but it is a nice curio."
1,The Best of John Denver,This is an import CD. The music is still very good but remember that these versions of the songs may not be the ones you remember growing up and listening to on the radio. I therefore gave it only one star because I was hoping that the cd had the original studio versions.Best of John Denver.
4,Great Power-Pop from Little Rock,"""O-Rama,"" Ashtray Babyhead's first power-pop rock album, is a blend of Weezer and Jimmy Eat World. It's a great little album that blasts through a smattering of snappy tunes. ""Bug,"" ""Dream Girl,"" ""Elaine, Elaine,"" and the title track are all stand-outs on the disc. The only downside to the tunes is that they all have pretty much the same tempo, but the album breezes by so quickly that it doesn't matter much (it clocks in at a little under 40 minutes). A fun album to play in your car with the windows down on a hot day."
1,No! BAD!,"I have just one thing to say: NEVER use these! Yes, they absorb the moisture from your key pads, but they hang on to the germs! They are very unhealthy for you and your flute. The moisture can also be absorbed back into the pads, causing damage and your pads won't last very long. I've been playing flute for 10 years now, and have never used these on the advice of my flute teacher. Cigarette papers are much better for absorbing excess moisture from keys. They are cheaper and a LOT more sanitary."
1,Destroyer of Flutes!,"I quite agree with the first review. These are very bad for your flute. They harbor bacteria, and moisture causing the pads to just re-absorb the moisture. This damages the pads and causes the need for frequent repair. As the other review said, if you need to remove moisture from your key pads, use cigarette paper, not these. These are VERY unhygenic andwill end up costing you hundreds, even thousands of dollars in repair fee for your instrument. Be smart and PLEASE don't use these."
4,Love it,"I have played flute fornine years and bought a pad saver my junior year in high school. This saved my flute pads from being replaced so often. I highly recommend this product. To help with germs, lightly spray with a disinfectant and let dry before putting back in your flute."
5,Phonemic Awareness,Anyone looking to fully understand the concept of phonemic awareness should purchase this book. It is a clear straightforward guide.
5,"""Speech to Print"" is Great to Teach in Speech","The book ""Speech to Print"" was an excellent review of phonology for me and gave me a better understanding of orthography. The chapter on morphology shed light on the struggles that my daughter is experiencing and will surely help me become a better therapist as well. Exercises throughout and at the end of chapters allowed for practice and checked for mastery, which is not only important for students but essential for those of us teaching the material as well."
2,"Unrealistic, tedious and cliche (WARNING: Spoilers)","I found it pretty ridiculous that Rosalind believed herself deserving of being whipped for lying about being able to pay for being broken out of prison. No regular person would have her thought processes leading to her agreement to be whipped. And the characters basically falling in love right from the beginning was really anti-climactic. I quickly lost interest, skimmed through the rest of the book, and saw that it just wasn't worth my time. Disappointing. So glad I merely borrowed it!"
4,Fairly nice sleeping bag,"You will have to take this review with a grain of salt. I purchased this to carry in the back of my SUV. I have not, and probably never will use it as a ""sleeping bag"". It is replacing a Coleman bag that I had for many years ( probably more than 30 ) - and I never had to use it other than to spread out in the back when my dogs were accompanying me in the SUV. I chose this bag based on the reviews and the fact that the outside is canvas and inside is flannel. The compression straps are a nice feature, and I'm sure most people would appreciate the included storage bag. The only disappointment I found was that ""full zipper"" means the zipper goes the full length - but not the width at the bottom. On the Coleman the zipper went across the width at the bottom as well - that made washing much easier. I am happy with this purchase for my intended use."
2,Missing a Lot!!,"Great to have some danzig videos, but why put multiple versions of different videos on it while most of the great Danzig videos are missing!! We want all the videos not just a few!!!"
2,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"I recognize the authors to be significant scholars capable of important work, but this book is downright deceitful in that the title and subtitle suggest that it is a scholarly effort when in fact it is a pop culture ""digest"" or collection of superficial lists. There is very little discussion worthy of the researchers and you should save your money for a real text if they do one. You can find ALL the information quite easily on the internet."
1,"@#$% you random house - kindle, not content",bennet cerf is spinning. twelve bucks for a kindle edition of a thing that would in a rational world be in public domain by now. talk about a travesty of the actual purpose of copyright. jdm is spinning as well. hope they lose major $$$ on this. jerks. a reasonably priced collection would have gotten my $$$.
4,Highlifter,"Lift kit was not to hard to install, although it did take longer than the 2 hours the instructions had said and the instructions were a little hard to understand. But with a little help we installed the kit with no other problems. Now my 26"" muddlites need to be 28"" Muddlites."
5,Self Guided Tour Must Have,"The Blue Guides don't disappoint, and this is no exception. Couldn't find in the library and glad that I purchased."
2,takes the light and joy out of the Venice experience,"Some travelers recommend the Blue Guide to Venice, especially for its walking itineraries. It doesn't have information on restaurants or hotels. It is an excellent reference, perhaps bring it with you and read up on each site before you leave your hotel room, but it is very very detailed and, in my opinion, dry reading. I like the Links book ""Venice for Pleasure"" better because there is much detail and history, but the tone is conversational; for me the Blue Guide is like reading an instruction manual."
4,Pumps up a walk,"I have thoroughly enjoyed using these ""sticks"" as I call them to pump up my walks and add some variety. This is an inexpensive entry level pole and works just fine for me. The only issue is that the little feet seem to twist when walking on pavement and need to be adjusted occasionally. I have even used them on a mountain short hike and they take a lot of the pressure off of the legs and work out my arms instead."
2,5 Walks and broken,I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she's just been able to get outside and use them this week. Today was her fifth walk with these sticks and one of the tabs that holds the strap to the stick broke. She loves walking with the sticks but what good are they if the straps won't stay attached. Don't buy until they redesign the tabs!!!!
3,walking fitness poles,First I thought they were too expensive. Second they came with no instructions. I had to get the instructions on the internet. Evidently I am not using them right as my back bothers me after I go walking.
3,This is just ok,"I bought this for an application that required it to hold at least 4-5lbs. It doesn't that well. For a 1 lbs item, you're good to go. But anything over 4, you're gonna get skipping and lags. It looks great though and even though the plastic is kinda cheap, it doesn't look it from distance which is what really matters."
3,GE Ring Volume,"Even though I have every volume setting up on high, I still miss calls because I can't hear the ring! Other than that, the phone is easy to use and we use the extra handset in the workshop."
3,Expandable GE cordless phone,"I have always used GE phones, so when my old one wore out I got this model. I love it, except for the fact you can't purchase the extra handsets. Office depot has them and they are $60! For an expandable handset by itself that is completely USELESS without the purchase of the Base, thank goodness it comes with one extra phone. If you are looking for more than 2 extentions purcase Uniden or panasonic, the extra handsets for them are only $20."
3,Extra Handsets are TOO EXPENSIVE !!!!!!,"Great phone, but the handests range between $45.00 to $60.00, the whole unit w/ 1 xtra handset only cost me $65.00 at Wal-Mart, so that is rediculous I think."
1,Not Recommended,This is a horrible phone. I loved mine at first too but less than 6 months after I bought it some of the buttons stopped working & I could only use it on speaker. Then the screen went out completely & I couldn't see anything on it. I have several friends who had this phone & the same thing happened to them. My advice...DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!!!
5,Roller Feeder Kudos,I live in North Central Florida and have 2 Roller Feeders and they absolutely are squirrel proof. I've looked for over 20 years for a feeder that the squirrels won't empty and this is it. It's hilarious to see the squirrels jump or climb down to it and see them fall to the ground. It only takes a couple of falls for them to stay clear. Now all the feed goes to the birds.
4,Necessary for any Hong Kong film fan...,"Honestly, I didn't think it was quite as good as the industry reviews above made it out to be. However, it must be said that there simply aren't many significant works on this topic, and as far as I can tell, this is THE benchmark work on the subject. The research was thorough enough, covering all major genres of Hong Kong cinema, and not just the actioners which made their way Stateside. If you are a Hong Kong film fan looking for a resource to guide your next purchase or rental, this is worth the investment.One complaint though: the authors tie EVERYthing to the 1997 return of Hong Kong from Great Britain back to China; I realize that the impending handover contributed strongly to the atmosphere of HK filmmaking (the point of the title), but some of the connections they made seem to stretch credulity."
2,IT'S ALL ABOUT THE HANDOVER,This book over-analyzes every film made in Hong Kong between the years 1980 to 1997. According to the authors every film is an analogy for the handover of Hong Kong back to China. And granted plenty were(John Woo's films for example) but I hardly think that Jackie Chan's fall from the clock tower in PROJECT A was an analogy for the falling value of the HK dollar. I would only suggest this book for fans of the genre. And even fans will be disappointed.
3,"Probably good for air soft, not good for bullets","The product doesn't really say what these are meant for. I bought them and took them out with my little brother to shoot my Ruger 10/22. There were a couple shots that weren't direct hits on the orange target that hit the stands. Even the few .22 caliber rounds that grazed the stands did a lot of damage. Two of them completely snapped off and one of the others probably won't hold the disk anymore.I gave it 3 stars because I'm assuming that using a bb gun or an air soft gun would be just fine, and probably a lot of fun."
4,Alrighty,These are great for just plinking around.-- WARNING --If you have a sibling that is just horrible at aiming do not buy these. My brother has destroyed two of them.
2,Sort of misleading,"These are 'ok' targets in that they're bright and easy to pick up. But the name 'Shatterblast' is misleading. I anticipated a slight ""puffing"" or some sort of reaction when hit. Basically it just breaks into pieces. The disks are more like plastic than they are chalk, and don't do much when hit other than break into pieces. Nothing really wrong with them, just hoped for more I guess."
2,okay,The stakes are a thin plastic that we ruined the first time out with a 22. The targets they hold are only about 2 inches in diameter.
5,Nephew loved them!,"These came on time, as described and work great! My nephew used a new Red Ryder to tear these up!"
5,Shooting fun,"These little suckers were made with a BB gun in mind but we use everything from a 22, 9mm. Fun challenge! The stakes do not hold regular sized clay targets but comes with Daisy target disks."
3,It's not surround sound!,"The phone has lots of nice options. However, when you're talking, it has a hollow sound to it. Even if you try and change the frequency, it doesn't improve much. Also, if you change frequencies during a call, you better tell the person you're talking to because they might think you've hung up while it's searching for the next frequency. All in all...it's an okay phone."
1,Poor Sound,"This phone with answering system was very easy to use, but the poor quality of voice sound made it fail the most basic test. I typically love talking to friends and family on the phone, but during the few days I used this phone the voice sounds were so annoying I couldn't wait to hang up.An additional missing feature is what I now know is called ""chain dialing."" This feature allows you to use several memories in sequence. My older AT&T; phone allowed this without any special feature beyond having several memory locations. Without this capacity, using a long-distance phone card that requires an access number plus a PIN number prior to dialing the number of the person you're calling becomes arduous."
4,Great book,"The author really kept me engaged in the story. Characters are well developed. After I finished, I immediately bought another of her books."
5,A fantastic journey,"Once you learned the players, you have to take them into your heart as very special friends. And like most families to many secrets, that need to come out to bring everyone closer"
3,Trust Fund Babies,This book was slow moving. Not well written. I couldn't tell when she was switching to a different character in the chapters.
3,"Flash in the pan band from LA, one of the best.","Cuban and jazz at the same time, Bongo Logic's TIPIQUEROS joins their other two releases as MUST HAVE. Bongolucious, and Despierta. Mostly instrumentals, but with some vocal cuts too, these releases by a hot little Los Angeles group of musicians, is a real product of its time.The Cuban base is evident all over, of course, but the players bring a lot more of the US/California scene into the music. Art Webb on flute, an old player from the NY salsa scene in the 70's, shares that experience with a great group of local players. Some of the cuts are updated cuban standards, and the others are their originals. Get them while they are around! You won't be sorry."
1,Castlemere CC-310 Natural Wood 16' High Feeder,"This product was a real let down. Especially when you consider the price.The overall appearance and low quality craftsmanship makes this a real loser. It looks as cheap, and is not worth the money. The quality of the wood is sub-standard and the finsh looks terrible. The only real upside to this product is the elevated height and stainless steel bowls. I would not recommend this product to anyone, at least not at this price, not to mention the rediculous shipping price that's tacked on. If you want quality, please keep looking, if you want to throw your money out the window, then this is the item for you. Thank You. I hope this has been a helpful review."
5,raised dog feeder,"I really love this product,I have a great dane and they have to eat on a raised platform and it's great for him. It's very sturdy and very easy to put together and at the perfect height for him. The bowls are very big for him and it doesn't take up much room, it also came very fast. It came a day before they said it would."
1,Bad Product,"Very bad product. Bad voice, you cannot hear what the presenter is saying.Bad picture. Only good cover.It would be better to sell the power point presentation itself."
4,From Edel clasics berlin classics,"It is impossible to receive righjt this cd, cause ther has been a cut in cd@s I only own the Bizet/part 2 albums made out of one . That one is good,for the rest i cannot command-criticize here. The music is allright, the cover is allright. Four stars to this cd"
5,A great children's series,"I bought this book to share with the kids in my 3rd grade book group. Not only did the girls love the series, but the boys begged to keep going."
1,Could be better,"The length is fine, if mot too long but the locking mechanism is less than effective. I have had the strap come undone so many times that I finally tied a knot in the strap to keep it from in threading itself from the quick connect mechanism."
1,SAD WASTE OF GOOD PAPER!,"One thing about it, Monica and Bill would definitely make a good couple, ""soul mates""?"
1,Have You No Sense Of Decency?,"Judith Regan, the publisher of this book, lambasts Monica Lewinsky's phalanx of lawyers and agents for ""pimping"" her story to the American consumers. If that's true, ""Monica's Untold Story"" is little more than cynical vampirism, a classic example of how a parasite feeds off its host in order to survive without contributing any livelihood.I mean, I love the Plympton cartoons--who doesn't?--but ""make the damn press all beg, fawn and clamor"" doesn't even SCAN properly"
5,Absolutely hilarious! A fun and innovative storytelling!!,"'Monica's Untold Story' broke through the stagnant, boring reporting we all got so tired of hearing. This book was a laugh out loud read that left me smiling for the rest of the day. Having to listen to endles reports about 'Monica's Story' by Andrew Morton, of which I fell asleep by the time I got to page 20, I was glad to know I could turn to something fun and fresh. We have heard all that before, through the trial, Linda and Barbara. Who wants to hear that same old story over and over?? Frankly, Morton's book was terrible. All of my girlfriends now have the Untold version and we all sat around and chuckled to ourselves about how great the rhyme and reason approach worked. Plympton's illustrations are absolutley unbelievable! This review can do Monica's Untold Story no justice. Hopefully it does all to tarnish the told version by Morton...don't waste your money on that."
4,The illustrations are worth a thousand words,This was awesome! I couldn't stop laughing. This is the whole truth & nothing but the truth. I will definitely tell all my friends to buy a copy.
5,Super tamper,"Funny how one reviewer said ""this thing must be a pound"" when it clearly says in the description that it's almost 1.5 pounds!It's the heaviest tamper I have ever used.It's perfect.p.s. It gets shipped in an envelope (??) for some reason... I think it should be shipped in a box, but that's not a reason to give this awesome tamper a lower score."
2,Ultimately delivered as promised,"The package arrived 12 days after placing the order and the tamper was tossed loose in the box without any packaging. There is no way to track the package.In fairness to the company, the tamper is of high quality and was not damaged in transit.Overall, while I am very pleased with my purchase, I tend to expect more from an on line merchant than what was delivered."
5,Useful Trees and Shrubs by Florence Bell Robinson,"The best compendium of information on trees and shrubs of North America. Wish it would be updated. I treasure mine. It is well worn with use.Joanne Kelly, President of Pilling Landscaping, Inc. in Stockbridge Massachusetts"
4,Good but would not buy again.....,"Good but would not buy again.....Garden of Life Primal Defense Ultra Ultimate Probiotics Formula, 180 VCaps....there are so many brands nowI think there's very little difference so I'm looking into less expensive as opposed to these!~"
2,Crushed!,"It looks like this particular package was pulled from a rubbish bin. Note, this formula is packaged in a glass bottle. It arrived crushed and totally unusable for consumption. Who wants ground glass in their mouth?"
3,You can see some difference when you start taking it,You can see some difference when you start taking it. Later I couldn't feel a big difference
4,Good product - but a little too good,"We, my wife and I, have been using the non-Ultra version for years to much success but this time I decided to try this Ultra version. My wife is pleased, it works well for her (she's usually constipated, and this helps that situation) but for me I've loosened up too much where as I usually don't have a problem. I'll probably switch back to Garden of Life Primal Defense (standard) next time because it helps both of us without the ill results for me."
5,works for me...,"Starting in December 2010, I had some kind of ""stomach thing"" going on that I just couldn't shake. I had very little appetite, and when I did make myself eat I felt I wasn't digesting it well (felt like a rock in my stomach). I also had bouts of nausea and just felt generally ""ugh."" Then I remembered I had half a bottle of these still in my fridge, and started taking them at the rate of just one per day. Within a few weeks, I realized my appetite and digestion were back to normal. I also wasn't getting as many painful ""attacks"" of gas stuck in my chest after eating. I decided to order another bottle before I ran out, and plan on continuing to take these indefinitely. I think the discounted price here is an excellent value and the benefits to over-all health over time will be well worth the investment."
4,Great Product-Does help to strengthen the immune system,"I have been purchasing this product for years-at least 6 years if not more. It does help my digestion, and it also strengthens my immune system. When my immune system is down I get cold sores-few times a months-however, when I take primal defense it strengthens my immune system and I don't get cold sore(to my understanding and research, cold sores erupt when immune system is down. Also, I have acidity problems and the probiotics helps to keep it in check, if I also take care of my diet-having more alkalizing fool. Great product."
5,Garden of Life,I use this product all the time and it seems to help. The price in better than in the stores
5,Garden of Life,I would highly recommend this product. I have been taking Garden of Life Primal Defense Ultra or Primal Defense since 2007 after I had a major bacterial intestinal infection. I have not had a recurrence since I've been using this product.
3,These probiotics are cultured in DAIRY!,Just a FYI for vegans out there. There are Probiotics out there that are not cultured in Dairy. Too late for me.
2,Contains iron,"I thought this would be the answer to my probiotic needs, but unfortunately the label says that it contains iron. So I'm using it every other day till it runs out, and alternating it with Florastor, which for now is my favorite, since it does not need refrigeration and had once been prescribed by my doctor after antibiotic use."
3,Product Good - Bottle Terrible to Open,product seems to help but the bottle is very difficult to open and requires great strength. It is a push and turn type cap so bottle openers do not really help.
5,Waiting for product to make me feel better,I've been taking for 3 weeks now and I'm slowly getting better but I'm still with just 1 capsule a day cause it's VERY strong
1,Dead,"I have great success with probiotics - this one had no effect. After about a week I went to the local health food store and bought another brand with a fresh date and quickly had the expected and usual result. I suspect that this Primal Defense bottle was out of date and dead, the date on the bottle was smudged and unreadable. Shelf life and storage conditions are crucial for probiotic products."
1,something wrong with me?,I took primal defense and after a few days I had such pain in my stomach that I had to discontinue taking it.
5,Help at last,"Have only been taking this for a couple of weeks and already I feel so much better. I have tried other probiotics and could not see that they did anything, but this is a good one finally."
2,Gluten ingredients. Watch out if you're celiac or gluten sensetive.,"I personally contacted this company because this product looked great. It got amazing reviews on amazon, the company has a good reputation, etc. So, when I spoke to garden of life, they said that two of there ingredients (oat grass and barley grass, don't know why the heck they added those...), may have actual grain pieces in them, which came through in the processing of them. Now, if you're celiac, that will seriously mess up your gut. I just want to let people know, who are celiac or gluten sensetive, that this product will probably cause you serious problems."
5,Really Good,this stuff just works ...bottom line it has helped me and many in my family . Would highly recommend to others with no caveats
5,Great Probiotic,"This is the best probiotic I've tried. It is reasonably priced on Amazon.com, which is a great bonus. I have tried several products from Garden of Life, and none of them have been disappointments, Primal Defense Ultra included."
3,"Don't really know how much this helps, but I keep on using it","I take at least two different types of probiotics daily. In the aggregate, they help, as I rarely have gastric upsets like I used to have before I started taking probiotics faithfully. But, I don't know which of the probiotics is the best, or if it is the combination of all of them. And, I am not about to perform a methodical long-term experiment to try to narrow down the choice.One thing to be careful about: the container is a brown glass bottle. I keep them in the refrigerator. When I opened a new bottle, the glass broke all around the periphery of the neck, and made a shallow gash in my thumb. I reported this to the manufacturer, and they were not at all concerned, though they sent me a free replacement. Amazon, likewise, was not concerned, and just referred me to the vendor. I also made a formal report to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I suggest that users take care when opening a new bottle for the first time."
2,author misses the point,"One problem with this book is the author's antagonism to those who attempt to prevent parental abuse. The effort to understand abuse is not an ""assault"" on the family. Quite the opposite."
4,Pretty Decent Soundtrack,"In The Mix is the soundtrack to current R&B superstar Usher's first big film. Although the movie recently floped the soundtrack isn't half bad. Rico Love (Usher's rapper) shines on three tracks and his R&B group One Chance are pretty decent. One Chance really impressed me when I heard them sing Can You Stand The Rain acapllea on BET'S 106 & Park. Other impressive tracks include the mid tempo slow jams Get Acquainted by Ryon Lovett and Against The World by Robin Thicke, I look forward to hearing both of their CD'S in the near future. All in all I would say give the soundtrack a listen or at least get a burnt copy."
3,In The Mix - smooth R'nB,"This is not a must have CD in a R'nB collection, but it is a nice CD, even though it is not outstanding....But if you are a true Usher fan it is surley a must have :-)"
3,wilson golf ball retriever,Great idea but poor quality. the plastic ball holder fractured with no trauma from the handle. Amazon exchanged the item. it is poorly designed at the ball carrier end. needs a stronger connection to the telescopic handle
1,Not satisfied,The product that I received was a complete disaster. The extentions would not stay engaged so the tubes were slipping in an out at will. The twist locks for the tubes were loose and would not stay in place. I don't know when I have purchased something that has given me such poor results. I am not a happy buyer.
1,Useless Junk,This thing arrived defective. One of the sections slides completely out when you extend it rendering the retriever worthless. It won't tighten back in. I'm returning this junk to Amazon and I will never order another product from Wilson. Thanks for wasting my time when I drive to the UPS pick-up center.
4,"Nice, but one showed up broken","Great to have, very compact. Ordered two... both retriever parts of the unit slipped out of the cardboard they were in (inside the amazon box)... and the orange section was snapped off on one. Amazon or whoever needs to reinforce the top part of the box so this does not happen."
1,$$ Too Pricey,"$108 are you kidding me? This product is way too high just for a ball retriver. I'm glad my balls are in the fairway. Keep one in my bag just in case, purchased from Walmart for less than $15."
1,Piece of Crap,"The first one came in broken, the second one lasted nine months, then broke. Think about it....not used that often...at least if you hit the ball OK!"
1,Kid would be disapointed,"I love kid rock and this video is a joke. I now know why this video is unauthorized, cuz it is as cheasy as you can get. It is an hour of the same pictures on the screen, no interviews with Bob, Nothing. If you buy this video the only thing you are going to see is a bunch of half naked girls that could not even get a modeling job for Doller General. A real kid rock fan would not buy this video, save your money for his show! I can not even begin to express my disappointment with this video."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This video is not worth the money. No interviews with the man, no concert footage, not even his music. NOT WORTH IT!"
1,KID ROCK,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME ON THIS VIDEO-IT IS LIKE A BAD PORNO MOVIE WITHOUT THE PORNO! IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH KID ROCK-NONE OF HIS MUSIC,NO CONCERT FOOTAGE-NOTHING! IF KID ROCK EVER SEES THIS VIDEO-HE WOULD ****!"
1,Kid Rock,I thought this was the worst movie ever.I LOVE Kid Rock A lot but this movie had nothing to do about him.It had no interviews with him or anything.It had People talking about him .I wanted to see live footage no such luck .No offince but the movie sucked bad.I hope there will be an official Kid Rock video out soon i would love to see it.
1,This video ...,"I bought this video much like other people thinking that maybe we could learn something new about Kid Rock, but instead we got some wanna-be porn stars dancing around and wishing they were with Kid Rock. No music, concert footage, interviews or anything besides pics of Kid on the video. Please do NOT waste money on this video!"
1,So BaD!!,"I though that this documentary about Kid Rock would be better, give you a look at his life, his past, is present, his music and him as an artist but what you got is very bad documentary about him, so boring and what about the girls in the beggining with her bikini showing off and you heard for at lest long 5 minutes, ""KiD RoCk...KiD RoCk...that's so stupid, well I guess immature, horny and stupid guys would like this dumb documentary who mean nothing!"
5,French's Meat Loaf Mix,This is one of the best meat loaf mixes I have ever used. I cannot find it in the stores now so thankfully I found it on Amazon It makes a great tasting meat loaf and is very easy.
5,GOD BLESS DRS R & R HELLER,"DRS. RICHARD AND RACHEL HELLER SHOULD RECEIVE THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR MEDICINE. THIS IS THE ONLY SANE APPROACH TO EATING ON THE PLANET. IT IS SAVING MY LIFE--AND WITHOUT DEPRIVATION. I NOW DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S RIGHT OR NOT TO EAT. THANK YOU, PRECIOUS DRS. H!!!!!"
1,Sill rehash of other books,Don't waste your money. There is nothing new in this book that the authors haven't written before - and they go on and on about the same facts...if they are facts.
2,Same old news,There was not much original in this book. I was very disappointed in it - maybe everything about low-carb eating has already been said. Save your money.
3,A whole book on low carb recovery???,"This book shows you how to get back on the low carb bandwagon. But they have spent and entire book on something that could've been a magazine article. Basically over 7 days just adding back in more protein, then salads and low carb veggies, and weeding out the bad carbs that you have let creep back in. It is not rocket science but for people that need a boost back on the wagon it may be helpful. Actually it could help someone get on low carb eating for the first time easier than doing it cold turkey."
2,broke after couple uses,"So I purchased this product for my dad for Christmas, which he enjoyed! Fun to play with in a family full of golfers. However, when he put it back in the box for storage, the plastic stand broke! Didn't last very long!"
1,didn't bother finishing this one,I expected to like this book but I found it boring and I didn't get much beyond the third chapter
2,Weak Plot,"I was dissapointed with this novel. It seemed to me that the book kept dragging itself. While there were interesting turns at some places, the conclusion was not dramatic. It did not make sense why one of those characters would have done the crime -- it was almost like the novel had to be ended and a culprit had to be picked by the toss of a coin.While the details into Victorian society are good -- the author repeats the same sentences too many times in the book. It could definitely have been a shorter book with a poor end."
3,Definitely not one of Anne Perry's best,This book is a disappointment - either Perry is suffering from writer's fatigue or she just went through the motions with this story. The plot is thin and the conclusion surprisingly trite and inept. A lot of attention is given to interpersonal relationships - Charlotte Pitt and General Balantyne; Gracie and Sergeant Tellman; Charlotte and Aunt Vespasia to the detriment of the storyline. I hope that Perry does better with her next book in this series. Me - I am looking forward to the next Monk/Hester Latterley book. Now that's a couple worth developing.
3,"If you have insomnia, this is the book for you.","I did manage to finish this book, but it took awhile. Was Ms. Perry under pressure from her publisher to finish this book? Not up to her usual standards. Very disappointing."
2,Boring whodunnit,"This book set in London is the late 19th century begins with a murder and ends with 100 pages of snoring. It's not so much a whodunit as a who cares?The characters are pallid and the plot concerns a blackmail plot of various high and mighties who risk losing their honor. There is much talk of honor -- very yawn-inducing.There is also the ""below stairs"" aspect of the story. The working class characters all speak in Cockney which becomes incredibly tiresome after a few sentences of stuff like this"" ""You dunno nuffink. So 'oo did yer get yer bubble an' squeak from? I can't be getting on wif anything wif you standin' in the middle o' the floor. Spec' me ter walk 'around yer?""Not only is this annoying and patronizing but it's not even accurate. If one was being consistent, one would say ""anyfink' to rhyme wiv nuffink.Bottom line: great for insomonia!"
1,Sacred Earth-Blue Ray-- X000306E27 Combo Set,"I purchased the Sacred Earth Combo Set. The DVD of the set is a pleasure to watch. The Blue Ray, on the other hand, is pure misery. The disc is full of ""glitches"", double images, bare spots and static ""snow"". I even purchased a new Blue Ray Player but no improvement."
3,Monsterous Hilarity,It's an older Scooby movie with Scrappy but that's fine here.It's a kids movie through and through.It's okay for the adults but not nearly as much as Reluctant Werewolf is in adult appeal.A must have in any Scooby Doo collection.
1,Wrong format?,"I ordered this DVD, excited to add another Scooby Doo movie to my expanding collection. When I tried to watch it a message appeared claiming that the DVD itself was in the ""Wrong format."" I find this confusing as I was unaware DVDs could be in a ""wrong format."" The movie itself is great, unfortunately my purchase experience was not and it's something I will have to replace with a properly formatted video."
3,What are Great Features and Battery Life without the Signal?,"The title says it all.* Great package: Features, size, functionality* Great battery life: Go 2-3 days on a charge, 500+ of talk time is easy* Poor signal: I think the internal antenna, small size and miserly use of power makes it hard to get a signal. I get drop outs all the time.If you do not mind the signal issues, this is a great and now VERY cheap phone."
2,Too many unnecessaries,"My main problem with this phone is the ""pocket dialing"" nuisance. They could have made it easier to lock the keys so you dont end up redialing over and over again unknowingly.Secondly, the camera picture quality, when compared to other models is poor. Even with the ""low light"" setting, it takes very poor photos.And the most annoying is the volume. The ringer volume is good, but the receiver volume is poor. I wouldnt recommend this camera."
4,sony ericsson t616,"I have had this phone for a few months now, and I love it. It has a many features such as a built in camera, bluetooth technology, and it even has an infrared function, which can be used to send info to and from smartphones and pda's. it is very light weight, and has a wonderful design. The only problems it has is the camera is not the best, it only supports polyphonic ring tones, and it has too many different ways to get on the internet, wich can somewhat often get activated accidentally. overall this is a great phone, with a few minor corks in the design..."
2,Bad Combination,Pos's: Sleek Phone. Phone store is good. Good Ringer.Neg's: Poor reception. Poor volume. Worst camera. Don't consider this as a camera.. Horrible game.
2,long talk time,"I have been using this phone for over a year now. the battery is great. I never have that much talk time in all my previous phones. the bluetooth earpiece is great too especially with the voice dialing. in the other hand bad reception (not like nokia, they are the best). I used to be with AT&T and after the became part of Cingular i thought we ganna have better reception... the only thing changed is they offer bad custmer services and less flixable plans..."
1,this phone sucks,i hate this phone. i hardly ever had service when i used it. sometimes the buttons wouldnt work so i had to take out the battery and put it back in to get the phone working again. and sometimes it would just go into cingular extened.
4,Good but wish it was bigger,"It's a perfectly good anti-static bag. Wish I would have gotten a little larger one. Many Ave sized MB's won't fit. It's a decent product, my mistake."
1,"Incompetent company, don't bother","If you want to get lab testing done, don't buy from this company. The guy was nice, but I waited three weeks with no results and had to call several times to get them."
1,Do Not Buy This Test Kit,"The ""results"" of this test kit will not tell you if you have mold growing on building materials in your house. It will only tell you if mold spores are in the air inside your house.Guess what? They are.Mold spores permeate outdoor and indoor environments.The best way to tell if you have a mold problem is to inspect your house. If there is visible mold on drywall or other building materials (usually the result of a flood and/or high relative humidity levels in your home), then a professional should be called to develop a remediation plan for your house.Sampling for mold is an unnecessary expense if you already have visible mold growth in your home. If you can see it, it's there. Have it removed under environmental controls by professionals.Do not waste your money on crap like this."
1,Sounds cheap - CD player stopped working,"The product looks fine, but as soon as I mounted it and started playing the radio and CD player, I found the sound to be very ""tin like"" and unimpressive. To make things worse, within 6 months, the CD player just stopped working for no rhyme or reason. One day I put in my favorite Italian CD and it would not even recognize the CD, so I tried several others (all original CD's, not home made). I then run 2 different CD Drive cleaners to clean the lens head... no good. CD drive is busted. Very disappointing product. I am going to purchase the Sony mounted radio/CD player that has received much better review instead. I will be avoiding all GPX products from now on.Do not buy this product."
2,It Broke,This is a cheaply made item and the CD player stopped working shortly after I got it. I would recomend something different.
1,Works But CHEAP,Not a good value. Product is thin plastic and has inferior components. As stated above the tuning dial is not digital rather old analogue tune it to your station and watch the digital display guess what station you are tuning to. It does have weather band a nice touch but not NOAA weather alert and you need to tune that in also as it is analogue as well. The AM/FM did pull in a few radio stations and offered a coaxial antenna input. The remote is CD function only! Over all sound and function is not worth the price paid. I would expect the MSRP to be @ 25.00 USD. That would be more appropriate. This one is getting RETURNED. I hear for the same price paid Kohl's Dept store has one and I have seen/heard it at a friends house and it is worth the $ less than 50. Live and Learn GPX = cheap quality and misleading advertising on the box.
2,Get this if you do not care about sound quality,"The sound quality is quite poor - think AM transistor radio. The tuning has a digital display, but a dial knob that is difficult to get tuned properly. I'm returning and going with a higher quality unit."
3,CD Player,This CD player is ok. I don't get a lot of radio stations with it compared to my other radios. I don't like that the remote doesn't work the radio or volume only the cd player. I wouldn't have rather paid a little more for a better one.
1,Don't buy this product!,I ordered this cd player/radio to mount under my kitchen cabinets. The cd player would not open. We had already made holes in the cabinets. They sent me a replacement which was also broken. The cd player will not work. I have been informed that none of them work due to a defect. So I can't take it down and send it back because I have made holes in the cabinets.
1,Busted on arrival,"After drilling holes and mounting the cursed thing, I found that the CD tray would not open -- no CD capability. To make matters worse this item, ordered on Oct. 26th, 05, was a Christmas gift and therefore didn't get opened until Dec. 25th. Result: Return not allowed. Bah Humbug!!!"
4,Good Value For The Price,"I bought one of these for my wife when I saw it in a Target ad and it's just fine. Sure, it's not got Sony sound (didn't pay $299 either) but for me it's a lot of product for $49. Includes mounting hardware etc."
2,It works but poor tuner,"Well, there is no way to improve the very poor tuner.. unable to get even the strongest stations without some other station stepping on it. CD player works if you move the secret switch on the side- Very poor monoral sound.. no real stereo.. kind of sound like a kids toy. Mounting, however, was a real treat- no prob at all and very straightforward. Still, all you have is a second rate unit."
2,Buy this ONLY if you liked the score...,"I loved the songs from the movie. Like someone here said, it did make the movie better. Unfortunately, they did not release a ""Various Artists"" soundtrack, thus resulting in this ""Score from..."" album. Anyway, here is the list of the songs from the movie:""Crash Into Me""The Dave Matthews Band""Stop By""Rahsaan Patterson""All Mixed Up""Red House Painters""Old Devil Moon""Carmen McRae""(We Were) Made For Each Other""Bekka & Billy""Sweet Home Alabama""Lynyrd Skynyrd""One Headlight""The Wallflowers""Happiness""Abra Moore""Earth vs. Me""Powerman 5000""The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You""Bryan AdamsHope this helped. Enjoy!"
2,It was ok but not what i thought it was going to be,Ok well i was so exited that amazon had this cd cuz i loved the songs on the movie which was so good it was very cute. alicia silverstone was good and how hot was benicio del toro lol. anyways the soundtrack was a big disapointment for me it had none of the songs that i wanted to hear on it exept for its all mixed up (great song). so i wanted to find out that other song i was looking for two days strait and could not find it but then i did so if anyone wants it the other song in the movie is crash into me by dave mathews band such a good song. so ya there it is just thought i would put it out for others so thats it
2,Dissappointed....but what could I expect.,"I bought this CD after falling in love with Lurie from the Get Shorty Soundtrack, and from the Fishing with John TV series. Unfortunately, I found that this album is almost entirely ""movie music"" which is fine if you're actually watching the film, but somehow lacks a context without the film. Heard the film was terrible, so I guess the context is about right. Only a few songs on this album are worth while, and they are not worth the price of admission."
2,Interesting... but...,"I got this as a text book for a literature class. As the teacher said it's a great book, and well edited... but... one little problem... the book contains NO female authors apparently. This is, in my opinion, a little bit of a failure on its part by far. It's also quite dry at times and lacks a bit of luster."
1,Doesnt work!,"I selected this product when I was purchasing the WR-300 weather alert radio. The website showed this item as an accessory. I connected it and havent seen it work once, even though there has been plenty of thunderstorm alerts and warnings. After using the WR-300 and seen the alert LEDs on the radio, I think this accessory is unnecessary."
2,Midland 18-STR Strobe light,I purchased the strobe light at the same time I purchased the weather radio however there is no jack for plugging in the strobe light. It would have been helpful if I had been informed of this discrepency when the order was processed.
1,Not for my weather radio,It wasn't made for my weather radio even though it was shown as an accessory otherwise it wouldbe great to have. Amazon took it back with shipping envelope and all. Thanks
1,Not bright enough,"I bought it for midland weather radio last year. When we had the weather alert, either tornado watch or warning, the strobe light did flash, but it is not bright enuf to wake me up when I was taking nap during the day. I'm deaf."
2,This is a Joke!,This item is a joke! It does not work with ALL Midland weather radios so beware. I hooked up mine and it is a waste of money. Maybe I did not know what I was expecting. I think the cord needs to be longer and the mount needs to have more options besides a one-time sticky pad. It flashes as the alert is going off only! It would have been better if it remained flashing to remind you an alert has been put out.
1,Midland Junk,"Save your money this is pure junk.Only flashes once when it comes on does not continue to flash.Save your money,junk,junk,""JUNK""!!!!!!!!!"
3,Owner/Monitor Opinion of Unit,"The alert unit itself is fine..but..when the radio sends an alert signal burst to activate, alarm does not really flash long enough..it goes out with the radio siren..it should be designed to stay activated until manually reset by whom ever as authority over the radio operation.Being a safety monitor for the complex of buildings I reside around , wx alerts are of mega importance as the businesses our system monitors also have many racks of sale merchandise normally outside of the actual store.KSMB9301"
4,Great attention-grabber,"Item works very well. Can be seen throughout office area when bad weather comes to town. If you work in offices with limited access to windows (who doesn't?) this is a handy item to have. Lets folks know they should pay better attention to the latest weather alerts affecting the local area -- perhaps even beating the bad weather home. If your weather radio supports devices like this one, it's well worth the extra investment. The only con -- it would be more convenient if a pair of AAA batteries was included."
2,Misleading...,I personally love Chinese Paladin and am very disappointed with this DVD series. There are no English subtitles even though the seller claimed that there is. You will have better luck streaming it online with great subs. Other then that the DVD's work perfectly if you are able to understand the language.
2,Really dumb!,"So three people have been locked in a cave by a Deliverance-style hillbilly because he has a sea monster in there that will enjoy eating them. They pull hopelessly against the steel bars that imprison them. Meanwhile, the hillbilly's wife feels sorry for them and enters the cave from the back entrance to bring them food. As they are moaning about how they'll never get past the bars, she suddenly shows up from behind them. Do they overpower the old lady and make her lead them to safety? Do they hold her hostage so the hillbilly guy will let them out? Do they simply follow her when she leaves? NO! She leaves and they go back to pulling on the steel bars. ""We've got to get out of here!"" Deliciously preposterous. I guess I recommend it after all."
5,great shoe,I bought these shoes for my daughter and she has been wearing them since I bought them. She said they are comfortable and cute.
2,Not comfortable for me--at all!,"Maybe I just have bizarre feet, but I found these to be so uncomfortable that I returned them. The fit was only so-so...I wear a girl's size 1, so I ordered the size 32 R. The length and width were okay, but the footbed was very hard and actually hurt my feet when I tried to walk. I lasted about five minutes before I changed shoes."
4,A dynamic first book of poems.,"Ken Babstock's Mean has all the punch you'd expect from a first book but much more of the polish. Check out his poem ""What We Didn't Tell the Medic"" about surviving a motorcycle crash, and keep an eye out for this promising young poet."
5,The Ultimate Vacation Fling,"Tresand makes me want to go to Hawaii! After loving Callie through the centuries, Tresand meets her again in modern day Hawaii. As her escort, he shows her the night life and falls in love with her. Lucky Callie!A great vampire love story. A must if you like vampire romances or are looking for something a little different from the every day romance."
4,great book,"I loved this book. It takes place in Hawaii. The heroine Calie has come for the vacation of a lifetime. She decides to really live and hires an escort. The man who answers her is Tresand, a mysterious man who will only meet her at night because he is a vampire. Of course she doesn't know this but she falls in love with him just the same. He is a tortured soul who tries to distance himself from her but his heart has already decided his fate. This story has some interesting secondary characters that I would enjoy reading about. Also it has a twist to it that I really enjoyed. Get this book if you can."
4,A rare good vampire romance,"most attempts at vampire romance go so far into the nasty erotic that they leave me completely cold. Few, though, manage to take a monster and make him a romantic hero...ms. kells has.Tresand is made a tragic hero in the first chapter of the story. You feel his torment and pain and terrible lonliness in a very short descriptionCailie is also tragically alone and terribly lacking in confidence. She is also bonded to Tresand, though she doesn't understand this bond. She has escaped her normal (tragic) life to Hawaii, and guess what, that's just where Tresand happens to live.The story is quite melodramatic and quite goth romantic without being p0rn. It was a very fast read. There was quite a bit of description (hair, clothes, etc) that was anachronistic to the 80's, but that wasn't too terribly distracting.The setting is lush as is the bond between these two characters. Over all a good read.(*)>"
4,Fun,This is a fun product and the orange coloring makes it easy to spot down range. The kids love how it explodes into pieces...
3,Not as exciting as I thought.,"First of all they were too small to fit the holder they were advertised with on the page so we had too hang them with duct tape. The break real good but a plastic jar of cheese balls is cheaper, more exciting and leaves something the birds can eat."
4,Great reactive target,"Shoot-N-C paper targets are nice, but sometimes you just need to break stuff to have fun. These offer great feedback especially for youngsters who are learning to shoot. I use these with a 0.177 air rifle and they work great. An edge shot will often just break that side of the disk off, but a center-ish shot will usually cause them to shatter into pieces.These are 2"" disks which are not meant to be launched from a trap. The non-refill box comes with stake-like holders that let you push them into the ground and insert a disk. It seems like these are intended for use with a pellet gun (air/springer) or a 22LR. A pellet gun and these make for great fun right in your back yard."
2,small,"Must of not understood the size, thought they were small trap targets, nope a little to small to go in the trap thrower, they are for plinking for a 22, or pellet gun"
2,Poor reference,"You'd think a book on any kind of First Aid (animals included) would be set up to be able to find things quickly, right? Well, I was amazed to find that the table of contents of this book actually has no page numbers. And, stunningly, there is no index at all. So how exactly are you supposed to find the information you need in an emergency?"
3,3.5. pretty good song the sentiments moved me more,Paul Simon is One of the Most Talented Songwriters ever to Me&this Song's Message really hit the spot.I enjoyed the Sentiment of It.it's one of those songs you will dig around Father's day&from being a Parent period.
5,Superb...I was glued to the screen watching these tapes.,These tapes are the best collection I have ever seen. If you would like to hear what Elvis was like day to day...buy this set of tapes.
2,not as pictured,"The item pictured is not the item that was sent. The item sent was the H30, which is similar in dimension but it does not fit my Bionaire air purifier."
1,Expensive for cheaply made Holmes filter knockoff,"The filter arrive on time, but I had to force it to fit. And the filter was put together wrong. The paper outside had the air flow indicator arrows which showed the air flow going in the wrong direction. I would not buy this product again."
1,Different filter than shown in pic,"The filter that is shown in the pic is not what I received. The one I received will not fit my Holmes Air Purifier_L. GoodeToney,Al"
1,Misleading...,"I have an MC thing coming for a little town function and I thought, ""Well, I suppose there's a right way and a wrong way to MC, so why not do a little research?"". Saw this book, the title of which includes the words ""A Master of Ceremonies Guide to All Occasions"". And that's true if all the occasions have something to do with church. Sections of the book are titled, ""Appeal for Choir Members"", ""Tithing"", and ""Noah and the Building Fund"". A better title would have included the words, ""A Master of Ceremonies Guide to Just a Tiny Little Amount of all Possible Occasions"". Suppose I should have researched the author first. Guess you really CAN'T judge a book by its cover."
4,Another good work by Adcock.,"The last book of the Hock series, ""Grief Street"", is a well-written thriller that ties up a few loose ends, and ends with hope restored to an area of Hell Kitchen. In this book, Hock tries to find a blaphamous killer, while dealing with some rogue ""rapid"" cops that hate Hock for telling on ""King Kong"" Kowalski. Kowalski himself finds that he finally has to come face to face with his demons. Finally, Hock finds the demented killer, and has a faceoff in a house with a bloody history, as an unexpected ally comes to his aid. Good finish."
2,A Disappointment!!,"I went into Grief Street with high expectations (I guess that's where I went wrong), but found it difficult to get involved in the book. I found the characters lacking in depth. The plot line is interesting but I found myself having a difficult time getting through the book. The action and suspense came through at times but was not enough to make me want to keep reading to find out what happens next. The action and drama picked up at the end as everything started to come together, but by than I had fallen asleep several times."
5,This one's a keeper,"Songs about you and me is a soulful collection of smooth sounds ideal for any occassion. Soft enough for a romantic candlelight dinner, but saucy enough for downtown driving. David's hypnotic voice will take control of your soul and leave you begging for more. Your ears will surrender to his style. His talent for the bass might even surpass his voice, but together they melt into one pefect union of sound."
2,Extremely slow,"If you like classical music played in a very ponderous manner, go ahead and buy this budget CD. If you like it played with passion and plenty of forward momentum, avoid this pathetic CD."
2,A disappointing little book,"Tim McCarver's ""The Perfect Season"" does not live up to its title....namely, that the 1998 baseball season was the best ever. No one doubts McCarver's expertise in the game, but there's a long-windedness about this book, much like his broadcast style. McCarver has too many chapters devoted to players whose entry into the book was made because they ""hit 50 doubles and stole 50 bases in one season"". I know that baseball is a game of statistics but this kind of minutiae (or""dim-minutiae"") is as meaningless as meat filler in a hamburger patty or a weatherman's recitation of the wind-chill factor....it gets boring very quickly. There are certainly some good chapters and well-deserved entries (the New York Yankees, Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire, and a wonderful tribute to Roger Maris), but I found myself being able to put this book down many times, even though the chapters are quite short. It's simply bogged down with too much useless detail."
3,A QUICK READ ON THE '98 SEASON,"The 1998 baseball season was, indeed, a memorable one, and Tim McCarver does a good job of reviewing it. The McGuire/Sosa home run battle made it especially so, and their respect for each other and the game added to it. Tim gives his opinions and analysis of events of the season which add to the book's interest. Brief chapters are devoted to such players as Dan Quisenberry and Eric Davis. The Yankees show what it takes to make a winning team by their ability to win in whatever way the other team makes available to them. The book was easy to read and I found it interesting, but I certainly wouldn't call it a classic by any means."
2,Baseball becoming WWF-ized,"1998 the perfect season? Yeah, right. Sammy Sosa hits 66 homeruns? PUH-lease. The ball was jackrabbitted up to create fan interest. The author, being a former catcher, is biased for hitters, but as far as the league goes homeruns = more money. I'd rather see an honest game than one where the fans are manipulated."
1,Satan on the Loose.,I orderd a like new hard back book. I recieved a badly worn paper back book. Very disapointed.
4,"Boy, it is tough being perfect!","This is a story of a woman who moves Lochdubh. She is a perfectionist in every way. She is very obsessive over housework and keeping things orderly. She becomes friendly with the doctor's wife who is alittle lazy and not very clean and turns her into a clean freak.She shows up dead and of course our favorite sleuth, Hamish MacBeth tried to solve the mystery.As a wife, who is not too obsessive about cleaning, it just goes to show you, too much of a good thing will kill you!"
4,Great eclectic pop by a singer-songwriter with vision,"A wonderful second effort from Detroit-area singer/songwriter Franke. If there weren't any other reasons to listen to this album, the inspired track ""Upon Seeing Simone,"" featuring a duet with the incredible Mitch Ryder is worth the price of admission. The band is tight, and long-time Franke harmonist Susan Calloway is fine form. If you've never heard Franke, this album is a wonderful place to begin an acquaintance with him."
4,Prescient look at how USSR could change with new leadership.,"One inaccuracy that I caught in this book (stating that hashish comes from poppies in Afghanistan) made me wonder what other inaccuracies existed in this book. Despite that, this is an entertaining tale that has proved to be decided prescient in what good and bad could come from a liberalized leadership in USSR. The book used a military coup rather than political change to get this change, but the rest is right on."
2,Not worth the time,"This is just not a good book. The characters are one-dimensional and completely unrealistic, the story is a hodge-podge of cliches bunched together in a completely implausible fashion. Moss is an expert on 80's Russia, but some of his misses here are just laughable and he doesn't have enough writing chops to make the story compelling. Don't waste your time on this, read a LeCarre book instead, or a Forsythe if you like espionage action, both of them are several leagues above Moss."
5,Number 1 best book of the year!,"This was my book of the year! As an older male who has been going to the Maine seacoast for some time, and who had my oldest granddaughter read Rachel Carson's Silent Spring when she was a young girl, I fell in love with this book before the 5th page!Congratulations to Jim Lynch, the author for having written a wonderful story. My recomendation is that if you love the sea and marvel at the mystery of of the tides then GET THIS BOOK!"
4,A wonderful read of the Puget Sound,Jim Lynch's The Highest Tide was a pleasure to read. His words transport the reader to the awkward days of adolescence and to the wonderful tidal flats of the Puget Sound. An enjoyable and eloquent book -- don't miss the opportunity to open your eyes!
4,Sex in the Mud Flats,"With so many other synopses and opinions preceding mine, I will only add that Lynch in this funny and touching book is making the same plea as in Border Songs, his novel that succeeded it. Wake up! Look around you! Nature in its fecundity is amazing. Also look at what we're doing to our earth and to other people. Could we have some more compassion, please? This book makes me want to go looking for a tide pool or a muddy sound."
4,A good read,The book was a good read and a story that I think most of us can relate to. I thought that the crush on the former baby sitter was perhaps the most realistic part of the book. Well next to the wanna be's that flocked to get in on the action.Great read over all.
3,Strange,"This book is slow paced and interesting. However, it did leave me wanting a little more out of Lynch. The main character is great, and all the characters really are really well developed, the story line, I felt needed something a little more to it."
1,Inappropriate Sexual Content,"I only made it through 11% of this book before deleting it from my library. I was very offended that a book about a 13 year old contained terms like, ""F*** you bangs"", ""One night love"", ""nipples big enough to hang a bath robe"", ""g-spot"", etc. Absolutely not a book that I would recommend to a 13 year old who is interested in a good marine biology/fantasy book. It was a complete distraction to the book and seemed more like a sexual coming of age info book than a read that would satisfy the appetite of a 13 year old science fantasy buff."
3,OK,"I always find commenting on books I listen to harder than ones I read. I think I have a detachment to the story when I listen to it. This was part of my local library's ""One Book, One County"" program. There was some preoccupation with sex in the book but I think it was authentic to the character and his age. As a Mom of a young boy, I just don't want to think about it though, LOL. All in all, a good read."
2,A BIG yawn,"The Highest Tide has a child protagonist, but is most definitely a book for adults. The writing isn't so much beautiful as convoluted and pretentious. The story underneath the writing is what the spotlight should be on. The story underneath the cluttered writing is standard fair - there's not much to it either even after wading through all 272 pages."
1,Yawwwnnnnnnnn!!!!!,This book is not worth the money. I can find many more cheap books that would keep me more entertained. It was weird and although it had a good plot it was executed terribly. The book too many weird twists and swore unnecessarily. I would spend my money elsewhere.
2,Didn't like it,"I love reading but reading this stilted writing felt more like work than joy. The prose is awkward as if the writing was forced or maybe a better way to say is this story is overwritten. The author doesn't let the writing flow he beats it into submission creating what is ultimately a tired, joyless read."
4,Great read!,This is a wonderfully written coming-of-age story. Lynch's characters are memorable and engaging and the setting is magical.
3,The Highest Tide by Jim Lynch,"Author Jim Lynch spins a story about Miles O'Malley, a 13 year-old living on Puget Sound in Washington state. Miles explores the tidal flats looking for exotic ocean life and finds a rare sea creature which makes him a target for the media and for wackos who hail him as a prophet. Somehow Miles must cope with his sudden fame and find a way to survive adolescence. Miles must deal with his fame, his relationship with the elderly Florence, his feelings for Angie, and his parents' separation. Lynch produces an in-depth look at an adolescent who is very kind and caring and in many ways very mature for his age. The characters are well-developed, but the overuse of description makes for a sluggish read. Oh, and there is some profanity and mild sexual content."
3,Easy Read,"This was a nice, feel good book. I felt like I knew who the characters were, and the author certainly knew about Puget Soundd"
2,You've got to be kidding me...,"Got this based on the strength of the ringing reviews. Since I've read this, I can't help but wonder if all these ringing reviews are from friends and family of the author. Sure seems it. This in no way deserves all these 5 stars! I've read hundreds and hundreds of ""literary"" novels. This is the worst book I've read in years. Just because a book uses flowery prose doesn't mean it's written well. The few honest reviews seem to have it right: this is overwritten (and poorly written). I hated most how the author talks down to his readers like we're all a bunch of dummies. Buy anything else but don't buy this."
1,Not worth a penny,"Forced dialogue, poor characterization, and almost no emotional pull renders an otherwise mediocre story into meaningless drivel. Not to mention it's over-written and constantly repetitive. A lot of times it's more like a science report and my 7th grade science book was more interesting."
2,Life on top of life on top of everything...Huh?,Is this meant for kids or what? The author writes in circles and I can't understand him half the time. I kept having to wake myself up. Not recommended for kids.
2,Disappointing,"My daughter (14) is the one who pointed this book out to me. She wondered why it has received such raves when it really is quite poorly done. Based on the reviews, I too was surprised by the lack of quality in the writing. I found this book hard to follow and quite disjointed. I kept waiting for the characters to clarify what was going on. I came away with the impression this might have been good if a hundred pages or so had been edited out especially all the repititious phrasing. Overall I have to rate the plot as 1-2 stars, the writing as a 2, and the creativity as a 0. It's possible that my biggest critique is the story seemed more like a bunch of dry, boring middle grade science lessons about oceans and tides than anything else."
1,Overwritten to the point of obfuscation,Got this book because of the review calling it a classic for all times. Calling The Highest Tide a classic is a travesty and a lie. The writing gave me a headache as the author is obviously in love with his own words to the point of making this a tedious read.
2,The Joy Of Discovery,"My review is strictly a nonliterary perspective, it is solely from the joy of discovery. I am by trade a Nature photographer, spending a great deal of my time hiking in State Forests and National Parks. There is a wonderful feeling of discovery when via my lens I see habits in wildlife unusual to my location or unusual period. The author through Miles captured that emotional rush to perfection. This could have been a wonderful book to inspire children to explore the natural world of planet earth. Sadly his unnecessary misogynistic description of many women and sexual references clearly make this an 18+ novel. These factors and the rushed ending reduced the stars for my rating."
5,This is my first Jim Lynch book,"First book I've read by Jim Lynch, however, I plan on going back and reading the others he has written. This book was one I couldn't put down! I have thouroughly enjoyed his style, I felt like I was right there in Olympia, Washington searching the flats for goeducks again. Great and a must read."
5,Great Book!,"I read this book when it was first published, and found it completely absorbing. A wonderful trip as a young boy moves through a very interesting time in his life. Really well written, and I always wondered what might happen to Miles when he grew up. A very satisfying and high quality read."
3,Wagner Opera Greats Curtique,"Well, that Loge I heard on ""Immerist Undak Loges Lohn"" sounded drunk and whinny, most certainly not the best I heard. That Kundry did not sound evil enough. Kundry is the vallian who wants to use the Holy Grail for no good at all and she sounds like a little angel. The Senta for ""Der Fliegende Hollender"" did notm in the least bit sounded heroic. I also heard the overture for that opera and the tempo wasn't fast enough to suit me. I will not cirtique on ""Die Mistersinger"" for I don't konw anything about it. Thank you for listenning to an 11 year old person."
3,blind blake,"Ok I'm happy with the purchase. I rate it 3.5 but couldn't work out how to do the extra half point.I bought a vinyl record in 1971 , early recordings of memphis minnie and kansas joe mccoy.The track bumblebee was virtually unlistenable..surface noise distortion the works.Now heres the point / subsequent cds bought in this century have the same track remastered and fine.Why the same efforts haven't been taken here is a mystery to me.Sound quality on some tracks is abysmal and it doesn't need to be."
5,Caillou caillou!,My dd love this DVD mostly due to the fact that the puppets do not interupt the cartoons just from one to next she doesnt like them and always wants me to skip them when they are on...
5,Awesome Caillou The Creative Movie,"This is 100% animated Caillou episodes. No more of those stupid puppet segments! Toddlers can pick up from life lessons based on how Caillou deals with everyday life. Family, friends & teacher guide Caillou on how to be a better person!"
2,Can't Hear It,"The content of the video is ok, but the sound goes way down when the shows start. The previews are fine, but when Caillou actually starts the sound goes way down and you have to have the TV on full blast just to barely hear it!!!"
2,Cannot skip previews at beginning,My son loves Caillou but on getting this DVD I was totally dismayed to find that I cannot skip the previews of other shows at the beginning. Don't like my son sitting through 5 minutes of commercials for other shows (which put unwanted ideas in his head!) and I don't like having to wait around to get the thing started when the menu finally appears. Annoying!
2,Purely One Dimensional,"Although the novel had piked my interest with the opening chapter, and is a definite entertaining read for a lazy Sunday afternoon, I have too say the novel is quite one-dimensional. Disregarding the improbability of the occurrences (besides all novels hope to add to our imaginations), the characters were grossly underdeveloped, with each chapter rehashing the same side of every persona, but in a different situation. There were few if any metaphors to develop depth to the story. However, several typical Indian sterotypes were displayed (although commonly addressed in many East-West books). Given that the story was written in first person through the eyes of Priya, her thoughts and observations seemed to be as simple-minded as the character herself. Overall a fun, light hearted read, with one dimensional characters and a one dimensional storyline, very much so like a typical Bollywood movie. Recommend it if you'd like a story spoon fed to you."
2,I've read this before,"I've read stories like this before, but Dont understand something...why in the end of the book she goes against everything that she knows? why does she end up getting rid of all of her ""Indian-ness"" It's a shame. America, is yes, white based. but that doesn't mean that the main cahrcher has to completely fit in, forsaking her religious, her own culture, her husband...how is that right?This book really left me feeling awful in the end, America doesn't have all the answers in the world, but isn't it a melting pot???"
4,I call this book...,"...Brain Candy. It's a fun little story that, while enjoyable to read, still leaves you thinking about your relationships with those you love. I'm so glad I picked this one up at my library book sale! I will pass this one around."
4,Great Summer Read!,"The Village Bride of Beverly Hills was recommended to me by one of my close friends. It was a very quick and enjoyable read that I think every married Indian gal or anyone who has a married Indian girlfiend can relate to on some level:) I really enjoyed this book and was excited to read it since I thought Kavita Daswani's other book - For Matrimonial Purposes, was great! If you are looking for a quick, funny and enjoyable summer read this is the book for you!"
4,Decent Follow Up,"The Bravery is a band that stands out it yet at the same time they don't. Pretty much because this new wave of alternative music is being used by so many different bands out there today. Modest Mouse, Franz Ferdinad and Keiser Cheifs just to name a few. However if you are a fan of this quintent their sophmore attempt is nothing to be sneezed at.The Bravery have matured in their musicianship as well as their style. The tracks flow evenly together and the stlye is a little different from the first album. The take on the sound leads towards pop bands from the early to mid 1960's. Sounds from bands like The Beach Boys, early Beatles as well as some psychedelia like Strawberry alarm clock. All and all if you are a fan of this sound/group its definitely worth the time listening to if not buying."
1,Truly Disappointed,"When I purchased this cd I had really high hopes for it but in the words of Morrissey, I was ""Truly Disappointed"""
2,Sophmore Jinx Strikes Again,"Why do bands that have successful debut records feel the need to pull the rug out from under their budding fans with such dismal second efforts? Much like the awfulSam's Townby the Killers, this second Bravery record falls flat on its face. Gone are the synths and driving bass of the debut record replaced with... I dunno, acoustic guitars? I have no idea what Sam Endicott is trying to accomplish here, but IMO he better jump back on the electro-rock bandwagon soon or it will be back to Skabba The Hut for him. There are only four songs worth a listen here, ""Believe"", ""...Knife in my Ear"", and ""Time Won't let me go"" are passable, and the second half of the CD only has one listenable song, ""Split Me Wide Open"". None of these songs approach the vibrancy of ""Honest Mistake"", ""Unconditional"", or ""Fearless"" from the first CD. Back to the drawing board guys, and SOON."
3,Not too great of a followup...,"The Bravery seem to have bottomed out with this one. Their first album was great; dark, moody, yet catchy at times and sonically interesting. This one however is just an over-commercialized pop record. Worth owning if you liked the group's debut album, but disapointing."
3,Goodbye infectious melodies and electronic dance vibes...hello noise,"Kinda makes you wonder if the first CD was the band's choice or the record label demanding they be more mainstream. Comparisons to New Order's electronic dance sounds are all but obliterated from this sophomore effort. There are still Cure similarities, this time in their darkest days, with a lot of flashbacks to The Clash as well. There's barely a synthesizer in sight, and only 2 songs make a meager attempt at living up to the fun that was the synthdance of ""An Honest Mistake."" But hey, The Killers second CD eventually grew on me and now i love it, so maybe this raucuous rock record will too--if they release plenty of dance remix singles... Calling Tommie Sunshine...."
3,"Fearless, not so much on this new album...","The Bravery's first CD was incredible.The BraveryUnfortunately that means that subsequent releases will always be compared to the original album.This CD while delivering some great tracks, for lack of a better word is not as ""catchy."" While there is not a total absence of ""catchyness"" (lol, not even a real word) there could be more of it. That's the limit of my disappointment. There are some great tracks as well as the expected strong lyrical backing. The album has a definite deeper feel than the previous release as well as some real upbeat tracks. It has lasting sound to it and you wont get tired of it too quickly.I give it 3 Stars. Give it a listen, form your own opinion."
5,Full Metal Panic FUMOFFU,"This is most enjoyable if you watch the previous box sets, full metal panic and full metal panic TSR raids. They lay out the foundation for the humor in FUMOFFU. If you like the previous box sets, you will enjoy this. Animation is good as the others and humor is mixed with the classroom atmosphere."
3,Enjoyable,Great series - funny spin off. The only disappointing thing about this set is that it's not available in WideScreen. So it doesn't look to good on my HDTV. Even with the zoom feature. Funimation is notorious for just copy and pasting old DVDs onto Blu-Ray and reselling them as Hi-Def. Purchase if you're a fan - skip otherwise. Especially at the price now.

4,"Less panic, more humor","This is a pretty light-hearted series, based (like oh-so-many Anime) at a high-school. Only several of the students are really Mercenaries, and one in particular takes his bodyguard role way too seriously. Those are the best moments in the series - his over-reaction to everyday occurrences. It's like putting Conan the Barbarian in charge of Medieval times and telling him to make it real. Way over the top and hilarious. You feel so sorry for Sousuke - but want to see him fail so badly.If you're a FMP fan, I'd watch this series (FUMOFFU - that's a mouth-full) - like light hearted adventure? Ditto. Looking for the all-out blast-fest that is FMP? Nope! This is a fun, family romp."
2,Speed adjustment doesn't work,"The saw packaging was top notch. It seems to have very good fit and finish, considering it was made in China, and was easy to clean up. The only problem is the variable speed function doesn't work. I am going to give it two stars for now. We will see if the replacement has the same problem...."
2,Bent upper blade clamp,"I purchased it locally, got it home assembled the stand mounted it and turned it on, it ran smooth and quite, however I didn't have time to test it out right away. After less than 1hr of use it seemed louder and to vibrate a good deal more. As I tried to figure out if I was crazy or the saw was really getting worse I saw that the blade clamp was mounted at an angle and appeared that after a little use it was bending to compensate. At this point and at most speeds, the entire stand moved back and forth. Also it was making what sounded like bearing noise from the upper arm. I returned it. I gave it 2 stars because even with the defect it worked better then the old Ryobi I had.The reality today is most products are made with defects. The buyer has to decide if the product they purchase is worth the time takes to work with the manufacture and get the defective parts replaced. To me the Delta was not worth that time."
4,Excellent power tool,"Stand functions great. Includes dust collection and blower. Just a little difficult to change blades. Overall great value, great tool!"
1,Just plain didn't work,"I took this scroll saw out of the box and set it up. I was so excited. Then I turned it on and nothing happened but a pathetic buzz. I turned it off, checked the instructions, checked the electrical plug, checked everything I could think of, then turned it on again. This time absolutely nothing happened. I couldn't believe it! I got a saw that was defective right out of the box! Thank goodness Amazon pays return shipping for defective goods."
3,China Made Machines!,"This scroll saw came with an upper arm clamp that sat on a 5 degree angle. The mounting area for the clamp was finished off crudely on a belt sander. I also had to straighten the upper blade clamping lever. It was bent in so far that it could not clamp the blade. Even though Delta made good on this and sent a replacement arm within 5 days. This is the second Delta machine that I own. The other is the 12"" diameter disk sander. I had problems with that one too. I believe that you can expect problems with Delta's made in China. They just haven't achieved good quality control as of yet."
1,Delta Scroll Saw,Very disappointed with the product. Bottom blade clamp would not hold the blade - Delta sent a new one and it still didn't work. Returned the item and purchased a Dewalt. Well worth the extra money. No problem receiving credit from Amazon. Very pleased with other products I have purchased from Amazon.
2,Scroll Saw Problems,"Amazon delivered the SS350LS in record time.I removed it from the box, put the stand together, cleaned the preservative oil from all parts, assembled the saw to the stand, adjusted the blade and cut my first piece. The saw worked great. Hardly any noise. Replaced the blade with one of mine and began cutting one of my projects and the top blade clamp snapped open. Tried to clamp it again and the blade clamp would not clamp again. The bottom clamp worked fine. However, without a usable top clamp the saw is USELESS!I'll be contacting both Delta and Amazon. Delta to complain about the faulty equipment and Amazon to get a replacement saw.If the blade clamps work the saw should be a great improvement over my previous scroll saws which I've used for 15 to 20 years."
5,Works well even with wiggly dog.,"Quality tool at reasonable price. Works well to remove hair from dog ears, just remove a bit at a time. Now if I could just get him to remain still!"
1,not for small dog ears,I have a toy poodle and this tool is too large to use safely with her ears. I am back to using fingers or tweezers to remove ear hair. Save your money if you have a small pet.
2,"Did not work for my dogs, but apparently does work.","Other reviewers say that this product worked for their animals. So, apparently it does work some of the time.It did not work for my dogs. I gave it to them according to the instructions and after 24 hours they continued to squirt diarrhea everywhere.I solved the problem by removing their food for 24 hours (allowing their system to reset) and giving them a bland diet of rice for a day. This is what most vets recommend.This product may work, but it does not cure all diarrhea like it and other reviewers imply."
1,Take your money elsewhere!,"Item is not at all what is in the photo or what's described. Product was all metal, rusty and old!"
3,Okay piece of equipment,"The packing was horrible. They just should've used a lot of bubble pads, not erratic pieces of foam that were stuffed in the box. Three parts were missing, which they replaced two of them in a timely manner. They told me the third part, which goes through the bolt that holds the seat to the base, wasn't used anymore... that it was already included in the bolt space. They were incorrect. That is why the seat moves from side to side when using the machine... the seat should only move up and down. Also, there is no grip-tape on the area where you put your feet. I had to buy some myself at Home Depot. Overall, for the price, it's a good piece of equipment."
3,Nice product if the parts are made correctly.,"I bought two of these and they are really great. The only complaint I have is that on one of them, the paddle wouldn't go together correctly. My son was unable to use it. But if all of the parts are correct it is tons of fun and I had lots of compliments on them at the lake. I also like the fact that they inflate/deflate very quickly. It literally took 5 seconds to remove the air and fold up."
5,Yay! They're Microwaveable!,I wanted to buy clear glass dishes to replace the ones that had chipped or broken over the years. I couldn't be happier with these. They are very attractive. My real test was the microwave test because I don't like microwaving on plastic plates and was having trouble finding decent microwaveable glass plates. So when they were delivered I immediately took one out and microwaved some beans on it for two minutes. The plate came through with flying colors...the true test was if the plate was hot or not and it wasn't. I am very pleased with this purchase.
1,Pretty pricey for cracked and chipped plates,"Three of the plates arrived chipped or cracked, including one with a dangerously sharp edge. Lots of bubble wrap around the product box, but virtually nothing between the plates themselves. I'm surprised that they were not all broken."
1,Not that great,This book doesn't have the greatest examples for the students. It also lacks a solutions manual. Not worth a 100 bucks to say the least.
2,Not Worth $100 Maybe $20,Much Errata in this book. Many concepts are just not explained in terms that can be understood. More effort was spent on marketing and cover design then content and proof reading.
4,"Not bad, but room for improvement","For the most part, I liked the book, it did a great job of detailing the division's activities from Normandy to the Ardennes.It was well detailed and the descriptions were well carried out. The big problems if there were any was that the writing style seemed to switch mid-book. The early part of the book was written a bit more ""rah-rah"" than the latter half, and the book suffered a little for it. Also, I feel the maps could have been better, and should have had the division sub-units movements marked.In any case, I found it a solid work that did it's intended job well."
2,When darknes has you falling asleep,"Each movie is worth about one star. I thought the movie was going to be scary, was I put to sleep. I could not understand the point of all the dialogue in a horror movie. The second movie put me to sleep not what I was expecting."
1,One of the worst gay films ever!,"One of the worst gay films ever, filled with ceaseless and pointless verbal diarrhea which keeps you on the edge of your seat because you will feel so drowsy that you can't sit straight!!!The first film has two guys talking about stupid stuff for 30 minutes and then shove something that looks vaguely like a negligible whiff of lame horror in the last 30 seconds just to absurdly proclaim itself as a gay horror film."
3,Plenty Suspensful,"Okay, so here's the deal. It's quite scary and chilling at times. I wouldn't take it seriously (as in any thriller), but if you want some fun characters, great tongue-in-cheek humor, jump scares and cute guys, then it's fun entertainment. The second story is more serious, more like Night Gallery. Overall it's fun gay entertainment, and some great kissing. The music is great!BTW, the director/cast info amazon has listed is wrong. This stars Mike Dolan, Ron Petronicolos, Matt Austin, Craig Staswick, Seth Adams."
3,Two gay horror films,"There are two gay themed films included. It is like in the old days at the drive-in movies.The main feature is ""When Darkness Falls"" I gave it 3 stars. It has hot, shirtless guys, a horror theme, some funny moments and the last five minutes is a nice, horror payoff. I liked it a lot and a very pleasant surprise. It is about a guy that invites another guy up to his secluded cabin for a weekend amd it turns out much different they either bargained for.. It is funny, sexy and finally scary.The co-feature is ""The Best of Care"". A much more serious film about a gay couple when one is forced to take care of the other, who is very ill. The one can never seem to please his sick mate and wishes for and finally gets his wish of not having to take care of his mate. Beware of what you wish for. I give this one 2 1/2 stars."
4,Fun movie night material,"Fun and not too heavy a movie. A few good scares and laughs, and I thought it was a great throw-back to the older fun horror movies."
1,Tedious nonsense,"Just when I thought gay-themed movies couldn't get any worse, along comes this dreary piece. It is difficult to believe that the filmmakers could have sat through the production process without falling asleep. Unless they were kept awake by laughing at the porn level dialogue. How the Austin Gay International Film Festival could have been bothered with it is astonishing. They must have a very low entry standard."
2,Disappointing,"To say I was disappointed in this ""guide"" is an understatement. I expected so much more from NPR. I live in New Orleans and lost a lot of my books in the flood following Katrina, so I needed a new classical music reference. This one is not at all useful to me."
2,Disappointed,No...I was not happy with the product and I was just as disappointed to find out that I was going to get a limited amount if I returned the product. I Refinish furniture for a living so I know the refinishing procedures already. I have not restored gun stock and was concerned about working on wood with detailed (checkered) character. There was no explaination about tools & methods. Wanted to know how to work around metal...or how to remove stock. The vidio is only professional to an amature and some of the procedures were questionable. How did the wood start out raw?....It had to be stripped with chemicals..possibly with parafin wax which has to be completely removed before the Finishing process can even begin. I was expecting a Restoring vidio...not a simple explaination that actually needs more explaination. Maybe in the mind of Mr. Janney this is professional but believe me...It's not.
1,Nothing but junk...,"I hate to admit that I read this book but I did pick it up at a bargain bin. This person is not a journalist and having witnessed what she has had to offer over the years...this book is more of the same. Dimond has no credibility as far as I am concerned. It would be laughable if it weren't for the fact that she has built her career of the back of trashing and misrepresenting Michael Jackson, who many seem to forget was a human being. I won't bother going into a blow by blow of what is wrong with this book, that has been done very well by many others.Don't waste your money...even if it's only a buck as it was for me. I would give it a zero if I could."
1,MISLEADING,"I can't understand why she would refer to THE (one, singular) trial as the ""2nd trial"". As in ""if he had not have settled and gone to trial there never would have been a 2nd trial"". WELL, there was NOT a ""2nd Trial""-so get your facts straight before you decide to publish a book on someone you so clearly loathe and detest. All this one sided , prejudiced reporting has got to stop. Do NOT buy this book or read ...kitty litter liner, maybe...but based on Dianne's multiple negative tv interviews RE: Michael Jackson I'd not recommend anything she writes."
1,Boatload of Crap,This is just another ignorant conspiracy againest Michael Jackson. Can someone please tell this witch that Jordan Chandler admitted it was a lie and just a way for his father to sabatoge money out of Michael. Look it Up.Do you have no shame woman?300 pages of bull to the s.Give Michael a dang break and get you freaking story straight before you start writing out of you a-hole.People like you are sick and might as well go work for National Enquire with your bs trash...
1,Diane was against michael not good intentions of her part,"I read the book, was not satisfied, I felt like Diane was out to get Michael, she made it sound like he was guilty. I read other books about Michaels trial and there were more realistic I felt she put allot of her ideas that dint really happen.She twisted the whole thing around. It dint impressed me at all."
2,One point of view...and only one,"This book is basically a synopsis of the prosecutions view of the case with Ms. Diamond constantly patting herself on the back for her investigative reporting. The book does not focus enough, or at all, on the fact that maybe the case was garbage. The book implies MJJ got away with molestations for 20+ years and it just so happens everyone around this man was too blinded by his celebrity to have a concience and call the police. It is only interesting to really understand the thinking of those who thought MJJ a lifelong pedophile above justice."
1,Discusting,"I hated this book. It is full of lies and I couldn't even finish reading it. I threw it in the trash where it belongs. This lady, or whatever, needs to back up and regroup. She obviously knows nothing about the kind of person Michael Jackson was. If only she was half the person he was. Save your money folks and do not buy this book. You will be very disappointed."
1,Be Careful What You Read,"I would rate this book on the 'no star' list..Mme Dimond was obviously very biased against Mr. Jackson, and conducted a virtual vendetta against him. Could she not stand to see genius applauded and appreciated? These little people (like her and a few others) who judged him so very meanly and unfairly, should receive worse treatment. He was someone who whose legacy will live forever in his music, certainly,,,and in his imitable videos (dance and singing). I have not one iota of respect for Mme. Dimond - unfortunately, she continues to badmouth him whenever she can .. why? The truth is out, finally. He was never guilty of any of those allegations, but that doesn't stop her or other members of the media from continuing to blacken his name. It is disgusting. It is difficult for people to admit they were wrong, especially to a huge public, but she and others would garner much more respect if they did just that. Michael certainly deserves that, and so does his family."
1,Her very financial security thrives on sensationalizing and truth distorting,"It never ceases to amaze me the way journalist ""starving for a story"" will take an incident in the life of a famous person and exploit it for their own personal gain. The problem I have with Diane Diamond is that during the Michael Jackson molestation trial all she was interested in was sensationalism, yet she consistently says all she wants is the truth. During the trial she did not report ""one"" not ""one"" good fact or happenings in the courtroom that were in Michael's favor; the facts that ultimately exonerated him. And there were many days of testimony that went in Michael's favor, testimony that tore the whole accusation apart, but none of it was reported by Diane Diamond. Now that he is dead, she wants to reap another round of financial gain. ""Get a life Diane; because you will reap what you sow."""
4,Interesting read,"Very well documented and researched. I would recommend reading the book BEFORE posting a review! In fact, some of the reviewers who have scorned this book should do a spell check before posting their rants!Whether you like Diane Dimond or not, it would be prudent to read the book and THEN make a judgement. You might be surprised at what you find inside its' pages."
1,Why are people so gullible?,"Ok, so Michael Jackson is different from most people, but that doesn't mean that every ridiculous thing written about him is true. Diane Diamond needs to stop using MJ's name for fame and fortune and actually do some real journalism. This book is just sensetionalized garbage like the other 100 books written about what a ""disturbed"" individual he is. Half the people who write these books don't even know him that well. They just need his name to pay there rent. He was found innocent, let him live in peace. He has that right like every other human being, I don't care how famous he is!"
1,Lies...lies and more lies!!,"What a shame that a human being can sink this low!!The woman has NEVER met Michael........so how can someone write a whole book based on opinion and state it is fact!!Michael was proven NOT GUILTY.....and Diane must feel very angry and sad as she would love to have seen him go down but until the day love is a crime.....Michael will walk free with his head held high!This book is HEAVILY biased, she is just making money off the name of Michael Jackson, this really is the nail in her coffin! What a sad pathetic woman she is to pursue her personal vendetta and harass this man with her evil and twisted words!A sad sad day for journalism."
1,Respect your time and don't read this gabage,"A writer? What a trash maker!Tresure your time and respect the truth.""Michael Jackson Conspiracy"" is really a great book."
1,Diamond? More like a lump of coal...,Even at $10.00 this book is a massive waste of money. It is clearly a last gasp of a tabloid media parasite trying to cash in on Michael Jackson after A JURY ACQUITTED HIM OF ALL CHARGES!A far better book is Conspiracy by Aphrodite Jones as the book is basically court transcripts dressed in prose to make for an easy and compelling read. It is a guide to why the prosecutions witch hunt went up in smoke. It is a shame that there is so little faith that the American legal system actually found justice in this case. I hope Diamond and those like her are happy to have killed the music during and after that trial and then eventually killed the man behind it.If the media convinced half the world that you were the lowest form of scum you would have trouble getting to sleep as well.
1,Grave Digger,"This book does not deserve even an one star rating. The author, who uses her position to boost her career and make a fortune off of negative spins, lies and manipulation of the general viewing public perception to damage the image of an innocent man is unconscionable.She continues to slander Michael Jackson even more so now that her lies and those of others have ruined his life to the point that it killed him. She does not have a soul and her nickname among the Michael Jackson fan community is ""Demon"" and that is truly who this person is - a modern day Lucifer who managed to help crucify an innocent man."
1,Another Loser Trying to get Rich by lying about MJ.,Another Loser Trying to get Rich by lying about MJ. There are no Facts in this book. It is all fake stories and lies that the author fabricated. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE LIES.
1,Tabloid Trash Diane Diamond,Michael Jackson is dead and still people want to portray him as a bad person. I think all this is in bad taste. Diane Diamond is at best a Tabliod journalist looking for a senational story. Nothing more sensational that the King of Pop! Unfortunately DD falls short. Everyone is wanting to make a quick buck from Jackson it seems i wonder when it will end?
1,Dimondesque garbage,"I even detest saying her name.....this is an awful, awful book. Do not waste your money - if someone offers it to you free be sure to burn it."
1,"Yes, I read the book. No, I didn't and wouldn't buy the book!","When we peddle bias and innuendo in order to make a buck, and CALL IT JOURNALISM, irreparable harm is done to a profession deeply rooted in the First Amendment. Freedom of the press is one of our most valuable freedoms, and with it comes great responsibility. I shudder to think that Ms. Dimond plays so fast and loose with such privilege!This is not about Michael Jackson; this is about all of us. Journalism is a profession where honesty is necessary to ensure a continuum of democracy and equality. This woman has shown little regard for a profession to which she has somehow ""attached"" herself. She sullies Mr. Jackson by placing his picture on the cover of such muck.E. Perry"
1,Crap,"For people like the reviewer above, you need to look at the facts of the case and not listen to tabloid bs like those spun by the mistress of MJ hatred, Diane Dimond. Read court transcipts, look at the dates, work out reason, Michael Jackson was found Not Guilty for a reason, not because he's a celebrity, not because he payed anybody off, but because there was NO evidence proving Michael did such a thing.If you sat at home every day watching Court TV waiting for updates on the case, you've sadly been shown the biased view of a selective group of MJ haters. If you were to search for facts yourself, by reading court transcripts and following the case, you would clearly see Michael Jackson didn't even breathe heavily on the boy let alone molest him.You Americans need to let go of this tabloid obsession, it's really disturbing."
1,Be careful who you believe,"I am not an investigative Journalist(and in the case of Diane Dimond I use the term ""Investigative"" loosely) neither am I a lawyer or an insider in any camp, and yet I know things-crucial things, that are not in Diane book, but should be in her book if people really want to know the truth about Michael Jackson and truely read a balance and objective book about him. Now, knowing what I know leads me to believe that either Diane makes up a lot of stuff herself or her sources are delibrately feeding her the wrong information.!!!"
1,"Diamond is a Liar,Racist&a tacky Turkey","Diane Diamond didn't get the Memo: Michael Jackson Won. time for you to get a real job&stop being a Tabloid Writer.all of these years&Diane Diamond is still trying to get a House,Car,Meal&lfestyle all in the name of Michael Joe.Jackson.Her Book just like Her Journalism is laughable. I watched as she,that chick from Vanity Fair,Nancy Grace&that other chick from Court Tv were all partying that it was gonna be the end for Michael jackson,but a funny thing happen:Michael JACKSON WON!!!! Not Guilty.time for Diane Diamond to get a job at Neverland handling what the Pets leave behind because Diane Diamond is a loaded Turd."
3,plausible,"I notice that die hard Jackson fans are very critical. I have to admit to being a long-term fan of his music, but accept that he could have been very flawed, dare I say, fatally flawed.This is told cogently and with many named sources, and the facts as described certainly suggest it's possible for a wealthy celebrity to commit crimes and receive different treatment from general public Joe, up to a point. There appeared to have been a lot of vested interests in keeping Michael's reputation pristine, and with the way celebrities and politicians manipulate the media, this isn't in any way far-fetched.I suspect more will come out in the next couple of years to clarify the truth. The difficult thing in this story is that parents involved with MJ were also flawed, but does that mean he was necessarily innocent of all accusations?I'd like to read more to find out."
1,tabloid baby,"Dimond's history and original connection to the Jackson case can be found in the book, Tabloid Baby by Burt Kearns, that she, as a truth-seeking journalist and powerful CNBC cohost of Geraldo Rivera, led the fight to repress because at the time she was trying to sell a similar book of her own .Sorry, Diane, but that's the truth.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580291074/qid=1133634727/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-1616613-5369466?s=books&v;=glance&n;=283155"
1,People Who Believe This book are Blind,"This book was so one sided and didn't even tell the truth about what happen in the court room. It's funny she only interviews people that MJ fired but people like Karen Faye, Jennifer Bratten, Travis Payne, and many others are written off as ''fans'' of his when they spent more time with him than anybody. Diane is a sad person. God don't like ugly!"
1,"Title should be ""Outside"" the Michael Jackson Case","Diane Dimond calls herself an ""investigative journalist"". This couldn't be farther from the truth. If she were a true investigator, looking for the truth, this book would have been written completely differently. There are so many facts that conflict with what she says, and her book is so filled with biased presumptions, speculation, inuendo, and conjecture, even the most open-minded reader would have a difficult time not being pursuaded in her direction. Another book has been written by someone who was literally ""inside"" the Jackson case, entitled ""The Michael Jackson Conspiracy"". If you are a Diane Dimond fan, at least do yourself a favor by reading a book with another viewpoint. It's only fair."
1,Not for Michael Fans,I really wish I would of read the reviews on this book before I bought it. From the very first page the authors tone was negative. Dont buy it. I threw it in the trash where it belongs.If you want to read a great book on the case read Redemption.
1,Delusional Diane,"Diane Dimond is a fired Inside Edition and Court TV reporter who desperately tried to do something to salvage her, ahem, career.A two minute google of information on both the Jordie Chandler lawsuit and the Arvizo trial makes this book nothing more than mullet wrapper. The Michal Jackson employees; fired, disgruntled, given money the tabloids to weave a tale.Every lie by this woman can be refuted by research. She needs to hang her head in shame.The sad issue is that now that Michael has passed, the witch hunt has stopped. But, for the longest time, the media, the unsated, immoral, money at all cost frenzy tortured Jackson. To hell with his reputation.Bashir, all the tabloids, Dimond, TV, and newsprint all had a hand in the worst lynching of a black man that I have seen.All for the God forsaken dollar."
1,Diana Dimond has a nasty wasy of writing.,"Dimond doesn't show any tact or people skills in dealing with this subject. She is a sensationalist. I recommend Aphrodite Jones ""Michael Jackson Conspiracy"""
1,cheap,"Cheap. As the person who wrote it. Clearly biased from beginning to end, dimond lines up with the unprofessional journos ready to judge Michael Jackson because ""they can"". Only she brings it on the verge of (if not beyond) obsession. Lame. If you want to see a professionally written book that will really give you an insight in Michael's trials (not tabloid garbage as this one), please read Aphrodite Jones' ""The Michael Jackson Conspiracy"". Then make up your mind.I would personally rename this book as: ""Be careful what you read""."
1,Another ignoramous taking a shot at MJ,This book is a joke. The content is riddled with falsehoods and/or construed facts. I stopped reading it after the incessant yammering became melancolicly laughable. God help the brainwashed public and the criminal genius media with blood on their hands.
1,I know its garbage and I haven't even read it!,"Diane Dimond has never had anything nice to say about MJ; and I refuse to read, much less buy anything she authors. The bible says good and evil doesn't mix; MJ is was an angel on earth and still is in heaven. Diane Dimond is the devil. She is biased and wanted to see Michael fall but he didn't, too bad for her. Don't buy her book her intentions are evil."
1,Jackson's `Dirty Diana`?,"Almost everybody knows D.D. was obsessed by M.J. like Tom Sneddon.I did not expect a nice ""story"" from her....This book is an evidence of her hate."
1,horrible book,"This book is just awful. Full of bias and lies. Don't waste your money on it. Even .26 is too much to pay for something like this trash. But, perhaps could come in handy if you run out of t.p."
1,Bias,"As I read this book I was asking my self ""Is this reporting"". I believe thsi to be a fabrication and sensationalized version of the authors delusions of graduer. I felt tht the book was more about her and what she did than it as about the trial. She says that she has devoted more thant 10 years to this case and I think she needs to seek professional help for her obsessions."
1,This book should be in the fiction section.,"The author of this book was fire by Court TV after her coverage on the Michael Jackson case.I highly recommend anyone who's interested in this case to read ""Michael Jackson Conspiracy"" instead.Michael Jackson Conspiracy"
1,Give me a break,"Even the ""Editorial Review"" of this book is tabloid, never mind what's between the pages. How much did the author pay Amazon to get that description posted there? I wanted to give it zero stars but the system wouldn't let me.More trash -"
1,waste of money..don't buy it!,"Anybody who says this book is great, well written, or the full truth, then you are just as delusional as diane diamond. I sat in that courtroom everyday and covered this trial for nbc news. After reading this book I can't help but wonder if this woman was sitting in the same courtroom as I was? There are alot of important things she's leaving out because she does'nt want people to know what really happened. If you want the TRUTH about the michael jackson trial, then buy Aprhodiate jones' book ""michael jackson conspiracy""....Now that's what you call responsible journalism"
2,Interesting read,"I found the book to be an interesting read, however, the writing was biased. Dimond repeated topics that were already addressed previously in the book. Dimond presented some of the facts objectively, but there was clearly a underlying dislike of Micheal Jackson."
3,Very easy to follow but found some inconsistencies.,"I read the Michael Jackson Conspiracy and this book which both are about the 2005 trial. This book was easier to follow even though I do believe MJ was innocent of the charges of this case (I'm still on the fence about his first case). As a reader you really are left to come up with your own conclusion. I don't remember much about the 2005 trial and didn't really follow it since I had long ago moved away from being a fan of Jackson, he was just tarnishing his image with his weird antics. But a pedophile I don't believe he was, he was just a strange concoction of his life. But both books helps the reader understand the evidence that the prosecution showed and how the defense...well defended their case. Diane Dimond does exploit the jurors and some of the antics of some after the trial ended which is very interesting. Well nonetheless the book was a good read and will help any reader shift through the facts and lies that were presented."
1,Completely Transparent,"I'm not even a rabid Michael Jackson fan, but I watched this woman all through the trial and she's not dealing with a full deck. Half of her claims could not be backed up and her bias was transparent. It's time Ms. Dimond to get a real job. I've only ever seen her talk about Jackson. People wonder why Michael Jackson was found not guilty. It shouldn't have been a surprise if you listened to or read something other than Diane Dimond. She belongs on the Faux News Network, a company that doesn't rely on facts."
3,"Pretty good, very sad","Diane does a better job than she is given credit balancing the agenda's and opinions of the story. Just when I was convinced she was anti-MJJ, she added interesting facts that seem to paint him more as a victim.The book points to graphic court details and allegations. Very disturbing. Ultimately, Michael put himself in a bad position with children that set him up to be exploited.Easy to read, surprisingly not too many pictures, this was a fast read."
5,If you're reading this review...,"...then its likely that you already know about this group. In fact, you've probably already nabbed this album and are looking for evidence that someone likes it as much as you do. I'm one of those people. In fact, I think I like it better (as a whole) than Faded Seaside Glamour.This is technically The Delays second full-length album, however they've recorded at least as many songs for B-sides to their singles (all of which are worthy of tracking down, I might add). Of these, Ride It On, Whenever You Fall I Die & Lost In A Melody are must-haves.Delays records definitely have that Phil Spector-ish ""wall of sound"" texture--big, layered melodies that would sound lush coming from transistor AM radios. The effect is a perfect compliment to Greg Gilbert's powerful falsetto. The lyrics can be downright indecipherable at times, but you won't care cuz the melodies are so addictive.Check out the archived live performance by the Delays from 7/28/2004 on KCRW.org."
1,letdown,"the first album was so good - walking the fine line between cheesy pop and beautiful sentiment. this one is just all cheese. the guitars have been replaced with 80's (the bad 80's) sounding synthesizers and the hooks, which may still be there, are just buried under layer after layer of production. i can't even believe this is the same band. i played it for several friends who i turned on to the delays without telling them who this was. the reception was..uh..not good."
4,Decent album,"After listening to Faded Seaside Glamour I had much higher expectations for this album. I guess I have to go back and give a few more listens, but I always find myself returning to their first album which is beautiful."
3,better beginning than finish,"I thought the first few cuts were near the quality of Faded Seaside Glamour, but then it got too bland."
1,What happened?,Huge letdown from FSG (which I consider a haunting and brilliant piece of work). What happened to these guys? It's like they're just going through the motions on this one. Quick-someone zap them with a defibrilator.
1,A big disappointment,"Five stars for Graham, Errico, and TOP. Zero stars for the rest. Just because you hung with Miles for awhile does not mean that you are automaticically a genius musician. Besides, the album is very short and way overpriced. A definite Do Not Buy."
3,I have others I like better.,"Not my favorite cookbook, but I can't quite put my finger on what it lacks for me. It sometimes calls for ingredients that are not basic for me."
2,Dry Ink Pad - Buy Your Own!,"We're potty training my 2 year old daughter and after she fills up her Potty Chart with stickers, she gets to go to the story and pick out a toy. This was her very first one and she was SO EXCITED. We looked around the store for about 20 minutes, and she decided that she wanted the STAMPS! When she finally got to play with them, she tried a couple times, but the pad was clearly dry and she said, ""It's not working!"" I ran around upstairs looking for a stamp pad that I had hopefully kept around, but nothing. When I came down, she was curled up on the couch looking SO SAD and I said, ""Why do you look so sad?"" And she said, ""I can't do it."" Poor thing thought it was her fault! I told her it wasn't and that I would go get her some new pads the next day, which I did. Once we had pads that worked, the stamps were fun, but the pad that came with it SHOULD HAVE WORKED."
3,Great stamps....dried out ink pad,"Love Melissa and Doug items and this is no exception. My 4 year old niece loves stamps and this is her new favorite. Only problem was that the ink pad was dried out and unusable....which made for a interesting birthday party...with a room for of little girls wanting to use a toy which they could not.This can be rectified by a few cheap pads at the local office store....but for such a great company, I would have expected a better ink pad."
4,FUN for the kids!,"The stamp set was great! BUT my only problem with it was the stamp pad. I had to buy a separate stamp pad, and not from the same brand, because the one that comes with the set itself is not good. So if you are going to buy this set, make sure to get another stamp pad. :) Other than that, it is great!"
3,Love the stamp set but ink pad DRY,"The set is great, fun, kids love it. But pad was dry and I had to use a pad from another set. Giving as gift, made for a frustrating moment. Difficult to find bottles of pink and/or purple ink. Open for suggestions"
2,Dissatisfied,"While the stamps themselves seem very nice, I was disappointed by how poorly the ink pads worked. I have been trying to find a new ink pad that my daughter can use to replace the one this stamp set came with. The colored pencils seem fine though."
1,Granddaughter Disappointed on Birthday Today!,"I purchased 3 or 4 items from Melissa & Doug for the first time and was quite surprised when my 7 year old granddaughtertold me she loved the stamps but that the stamp pad (both sides) were dry and had no ink for her stamps! I felt so sadto see my granddaughter so disappointed because this was the bigger, nicer stamp set (I ordered two). I have an aircaston my right leg but now am left with the task of finding ink for my granddaughter. On the brighter side, she loved thecollection of 700 Stickers I also bought! Hopefully ""Melissa & Doug"" will remedy this situation upon reading this post.I hope so since I have been unemployed so long my unemployment ran out (I reside in Hawaii).Melissa & Doug Friendship Stamp Set"
1,A Disappointment,I bought this for my daughter. I thought it would be a fun activity for us at home. I was excited about it thinking it would be fun. This product was a huge disappointment. The ink was dried out or something was wrong with it. After trying the ink on a couple of stamps we put the set away. We probably wont be playing with it unless I go buy ink elsewhere.
4,stamp set,Stamp set offered a nice variety to make pictures. Ink pad will need replenishing. A good craft for a rainy day.
2,DO NOT BUY,my daughter selena she loved the stamps bt the ink did not work and when she stamped the stamps on her hand nothing showed up so if i were u DO NOT GET THIS AT ALL!!!!!!!! :)
4,Nice,"I got this for my niece for christmas and, according to my sister, my niece was very excited about this gift. As far as how well the stamps hold up or if the ink pad was good or not I can't say as I am not there to ask my niece about it. But I'm sure they are just fine, at least for a young girl."
2,What are you thinking?,"Really, your gonna give your child stamps and ink? My wife is crazy, but if you don't care about ink and stamps getting on everything, including the nice floor that you spent hours sanding and putting a nice finish on, then go ahead. Really, I shouldn't care, they're only little once and kids really enjoy this stuff. I'd give it 5 stars at the kids point of view, but I don't like the mess and it's a parents review."
1,Melissa and Doug Friendship stamp set on Amazon,We are disappointed with this stamp set. The stamp pad is dry and there are no instructions on how to moisten it - water doesn't work very well. Can't get the purple to come off at all and pink just barely. The pencils are so hard or dry they won't put color on paper. :-(
3,"Decent set, but the ink pad was dry; dissapointed","My daughter LOVES stamps since she gets them every week at the little gym she attends for playtime/gymnastics. We thought to get her this as a gift that we knew she would love. Quite disappointing when she tried to stamp everything and nothing was showing up. The ink pad was bone dry. I even tried to add a little water to it, which allowed for a watery very faint stamp, but not what we expected. We tried to pretend we saw it and say we loved the stamps (she's under 2--these kinda things till work), and then boxed it back up for a return.The set seemed durable and could be cute if it worked. As others mentioned, the lack of a good cover makes this harder to store. All the stamp ""handles"" are made of wood so seem to be well made and will last."
4,Problems with the ink...,"I purchased this kit for my 4 year old niece for Christmas. She was not yet familiar with stamps, but she LOVES arts and crafts! Stamps are durable and a fun collectors item - great for multiple craft purposes over one's lifespan. This is such a cute kit that provides a variety of stamps, pink and purple ink, and colored pencils for coloring in the stamped images. Perfect - right? Almost. I was so disapointed to hear back from my niece that only the purple ink would work and that the pink ink was completely dried up. Small deal to us adults but big deal to a 4 year old. So now the perfect stamp kit is going to keep costing me more time and money as i need to buy a pink refil and additional stamp pads since the pink ink did not work at all. Bummer. Due to this experience i doubt i will be purchasing any more Melissa and Doug ink pads."
3,OK,I have had this stamp set for a while and I have to say I really did not really use it much.The colored pencils don`t show up very well.The stamps worked but I had to use paper towels and a cup of water to clean the ink off.The ink showed up and was colorful but the set only comes with 2 colors of ink I would recommend that if you plan on getting the kit you also get some other ink to go with it. Overall the kit is OK if you have someone that is willing to clean it up after they are done using it.
1,I wouldn't buy it again.,"The stamp pad is dried out and useless. It can be re-inked, of course, but it's a new product and I shouldn't have to fix it right out of the box. Speaking of the box, it's wooden but there's no lid. Pretty useless for storage if you ask me. The bottom line is that my daughter likes the stamps themselves so I won't be hassling with returning this product. Given the choice, though, I definitely wouldn't buy it again."
1,DO NOT BUY - INK DOES NOT WORK!!,The Ink does not work at ALL!!! Stamps are cute but you will have to buy additional ink. The stamsp seem durable but like I said they colored ink is worthless.
2,Below Melissa & Doug's standards,"I bought this for my 5-year old granddaughter. When it arrived the ink was dry, and even adding water didn't help. There is also no lid on the kit for ease of storage. Usually I love everything by Melissa & Doug, but this was not up to par. Very disappointing."
3,Buy a seperate ink pad!,"We got this a few days ago. I wanted so badly for my daughters to see how fun it would be to stamp pictures and then color them. Unfortunately the ink pad it came with was dried up!! :\ So now we have to wait to use the stamps until we can order another ink pad. I am opting for black or blue ink. The hot pink worked okay, but was very light. The purple was completely dried up. I suggest any one who purchases this to buy a seperate ink pad in the same order, so you won't have to wait to use the fun stamps."
3,Great exept dry ink pads,I bought this for my 8 year old sisters birthday and she is an artsy kind of girl. Well she took it home two days after I received it and opened it to use it and the pads of ink were dried. I was surprised since the company is Melissa and Doug usually great products but this time I am not too satisfied.
4,Fun toy,Bought this for two 3 year girls and they enjoyed it. Great to pull out when you need indoor fun.
3,Watch out for the inkpad,"The stamps are very cute, the box comes handy, looks very professional. I bought this for the kids, and they really loved the stamps inside. Unfortunately, the inkpad was completely dry, which dissapointed the kids alot. They literaly couldn't stamp because the inkpad is dry.I hope the seller would make their ink last longer or at least sell those that actually has ink in the inkpad. Other than that, the whole set was lovely. But i can't help give three stars because ink is the key in this stamp set."
2,Dry Stamps,"I should have read the reviews. The ink is dry and the pencils barely show. Saev your money, Do not purchase this product as is. Purchase the stamps and ink pad separately."
1,Melissa & Doug Friendship Stamp Set,"Was extremely dissapointed with this product....Only two ink colors that were dry. No matter how hard my grand daughter pressed down, you could barely see the print. Pencil's were cheap & barely showed color.....It went in the garbage & I will never buy from this seller again."
2,dried out ink and very faint stamp impression,"I am surprised to see such high reviews of this product. The ink was practically dried out upon opening it, and when you stamp an image on paper it is so faint, it is barely visible... I don't know if I just got an old set or what, but I certainly wasn't impressed..."
1,Ink doesn't work!,"We got this for our daughter for Christmas 2011 and she was so excited, loves stamps but we went to use it and the ink doesn't even come out on the stamp!"
1,Ink pad was dry!!,"I should have read the reviews before buying this as a Christmas present for my niece. It arrived with dry ink as the other reviewers mentioned and rather than have them send the gift back, I sent her a new ink pad to replace the original. Amazon should pull this set all together. It is useless!"
2,Disapointed on Christmas Morning,My granddaughter excitedly opened this gift on Christmas Morning only to find that the enclosed ink pad was mostly dried out. Very disappointed.
4,Stamp Set,Purchased these as a xmas gift for toddler who is always asking for stamps to play with at home. I know she will love these. Great find and Great buy.
2,stamps ugh,The ink pads had no ink the ink pads are all dried all out what good are stamps with no ink
1,Waste of Money,Disappointed---and huge let down. My daughter was so excited to open this up and start stamping...Unfortunately it had 2 dried out stamp colors. For the amount of money it would be expected that a stamp set has working stamp ink. Since we opened it we cannot return it.
3,Compulsion,"The movie is a great movie especially since its a true story, however, the version you sent is not the version I like best , I wanted the one staring Dean Stockwell the one I bought from you stars Orson Wells and the stories are a little different.......If you have the version with Dean Stockwell I would certainly purchase it...thank you"
4,Worth Watching,"Judd Steiner (Dean Stockwell) and his friend Arthur Straus (Bradford Dillman) are two extremely intelligent students who believe they can get away with anything. They try to live life to the fullest, picking up women left and right and taking dangerous joyrides at night. One night, Arthur decides they must experience murder, so they choose a target and commit the crime. They believe they have covered up all of the evidence, but Judd leaves his glasses on the body. Why should the cops link the glasses to him? It all inevitably leads to trial where an expert lawyer (Orson Welles) comes to their defense.An interesting film, Compulsion causes us to feel sorry for Judd, an attractive victim of his friend's desires. However, why should we feel sorry for a killer, a weak man who succumbed to peer pressure? Because of this sympathy, the ending is only slightly satisfying."
4,Solid docudrama,"The Bottom Line:A well-made film that follows the facts of the ""trial of the century"" Leopold and Loeb case fairly closely (while admittedly leaving out some of the more salacious details) and features several splendid performances, Compulsion is better in its first half than its long-winded courtroom drama conclusion, but it's still an interesting film that should appeal to people familiar with the case and neophytes alike.3/4"
1,Not the easiest or best sounding string for the $$,"I play and teach bass for a living. I strung a Peavey Cirrus with the Marcus Miller Fat Beams, and it took close to a month to get the strings to be really playable.These new lo-riders that I put on my Ibanez Soundgear 5-string are the same exact case. I actually had to adjust the string height because of terrible fret buzz on these strings. I am going back to D'Addario after I break these in and toss them. Very disappointed in the bass strings all around."
3,So so,This is an okay book. Written in both first and third person. It was an easy read with extremely short chapters. Plot was okay at best.
1,Not well written at all!,"This book was not written well at all! IT has no comparison to Bridget Jones or anything like it...Firstly, the setting is in LA (Hollywood specifically), but all the American characters talk like they are British! They say things like ""Indeed"" or ""let's have a go,"" sayings that are basically unknown in America! the author is unable to capture the American vernacular, and her character Tavis, the token hot guy, represents the typical American guy by saying ""man"" after every sentence...Also, the author would represent Sadie's naivate regarding America by having the other characters say ""After all, this is LA"" or ""Welcome to Hollylwood."" This sentence appeared on almost every page to the point where I was like yes, I GET IT, LA IS DIFFERENT FROM London!"
1,Meco Grill,"I ordered a Meco Grill for $115.24, had free shipping. Recieved the grill $137.93. Check on line the day I recieved the grill, sales for the 4100, $99.00. Called C.S they said I did not check free shipping. Would not give me the discount or remove the shipping. I am out $38.93.I needed the Grill for my grandchildren's birthday party. 6/13/09. Will not place another order with AMAZON. Douglas Wayne Kirby"
1,A vastly disappointing book.,"After noting The Knot's website and seeing Roney on THE VIEW recently, I'm frankly quite shocked by the lack of anything substantial in this book. The advice is trite, the observations are absolutely useless and the content mimics every other wedding book I've ever consulted. And I should know. I'm actually getting married for the third time soon....And the truth is that I was hoping to find a wedding book out there which is as vital, hopeful and fresh as I feel.....clearly this ain't it, folks.....don't waste your money here; keep looking!"
5,GREAT Book!!,"I would recommend this book for any new Bride who wants great advice on weddings. I have read several books and this one has nice quality information - in great detail. If you want to READ a book, not just look at pictures, this is the book for you. It's the best!!"
3,Save your money and don't get this one,"I've bought quite a few wedding books while planning my September 99 wedding and yes, I consider myself a wedding book addict. I read all the synopsis and reviews about how great this book was. I have read much better books than this. You have to be totally wedding ignorant to get much out of this book. Their website is better than the book."
2,"Thick book, but full of air","VERY DISAPPOINTED. There is so much fluff in this book and not nearly enough real information that could help me plan my non-traditional wedding. I was hoping for new ideas and contemporary concepts like all the advertising says, but there wasn't any. M. Dennan"
3,I expected much more than I got.,"Just because the book is thick and has a lot of pages, it doesn't mean it is filled with totally useful information. I'd return the book if I could because all the information in it is on the site. I guess I was disappointed because I expected a heck of a lot more than I got. Beware all the hype."
3,I don't get all the hype of this book,"It was a decent resource, but anyone who has done any planning and research will find this book has the same material that you have already found. It was a good book, but I don't think it is as great as everyone thinks it is. You have to be a pretty naive bride to think this is all that."
2,Overrated and Understated,"I was expected a heck of a lot more interesting, unique and contemporary ideas. But all I got was the same stuff that is in all the other wedding books I've seen."
5,Couldn't Have Done It Without The Knot's Book,Getting married is a daunting task -- especially if your not one of those silly girls that fantasized about her wedding her whole life. We had no idea about the insanity involved in wedding planning. The Knot's book and website offered REAL advice for the bride and groom. None of that silly cookie-cutter stuff you find in most bridal magazines and wedding planners. We were inspired to create our own traditions and rituals. It was wonderful -- and we couldn't have done it without the Knot!
5,Every bride and groom should BUY THIS BOOK!,"I am so thankful for The Knot book! It has helped me so much with good advice and creative ideas. But, most of all, I like it because it's different -- I sometimes have funky ideas and The Knot doesn't chide me for that. It has helped me realize that my wedding can be whatever I want it to be and I don't have to follow ALL the rules. I use the website too, but the book is great because it travels so well!! Highly recommended."
1,This shot glass mold sucks,Many of the shot molds broke after the first use. The silicone ones are so much better than this dumb plastic one.
4,Fantastic,"I bought this for my daughter, who loves Rhinos. I didn't expect to learn as much as I did."
2,Disappointed,"I needed to replace my very inexpensive expansion band watch and ordered this one. I have a medium size wrist and this band is too big for me! When worn it is loose and does not have a snug fit like I expected. It fits more like a bracelet watch. Also, the inner part of the band and edges of the band are not smooth like you would expect. To me it feels scratchy and uncomfortable when putting it on. I think it could actually scratch your skin if you weren't careful when putting it on. To me, the quality and finish of the metal is sub-standard. I would not buy this watch again or recommend it."
5,Cute watch,"I love this watch! It's so cute and dainty, I also like the expansion band on it much better than the braclet type which never seem to fit quite right."
4,good but expensive,This is the only product my wife can use on her face without it breaking out. Would have given it five stars but is is too pricey.
5,Best Lotion,"I have very sensitive skin and can not use many soaps, lotions, deodorants, perfumes, etc. My dermatologist recommended this lotion to me about 7 years ago and nothing works like it. It leaves my skin silky soft. I use it on my face and body. I've never been able to put any lotion on my face in the past without getting a reaction. Moisturel is the only one I have ever been able to use. Every once in a while I'll buy something else when I can't find moisturel and I'm always disappointed. Once you try it, you'll want nothing else."
1,Oh please,"This movie sucks, big time ... though sadly this isn't the worst I've seen (*cough* Dark Heaven, Kill By Inches *cough*) but this is severely bad.If you like low budget, boring horror films, this is the one for you. Other than that, don't waste your time or money unless you want to see for yourself how bad this movie really is."
1,Severed - Sever yourself from watching this.,"A movie about Voodoo and decapitation sounds good in my book, but not this egregious waste of time and money. It looks like it was filmed on home video cameras and is reminiscent of soft-porn, but a horror movie. No plot, low budget, and terrible acting. Don't get me wrong I love low budget B-movies, but this movie is terrible. It seems like nowadays people don't know how to make a good low budget Horror movie. The only parts worth watching are some heads getting lopped off, but they're not even that great, and you have to sit through a bunch of other boring scenes to get to them. I wouldn't recommend this title to anybody."
1,They actually released this movie?,"I ran a movie review website called ""The Severed Head Movie Review"" from about 1994 to late 1999. I reviewed movies in the theaters, on video and even had a few independent movie makers submit their movies for review. This was one of those idependent movies that I received in the mail. It was also the last movie I ever reviewed. I was pretty exicited about reviewing it as it was called Severed. That excitement quickly vanished. This movie was terrible. Poor acting all around. Terrible script. Bad audio throughout. Now I see that they actually released it to the public. Dear Lord what were they thinking? It is amazing that they actually got someone to put money into this garbage. The only half way decent acting was the guy doing the autopsy. But even his character was just an old cliche. I got this movie for free and it wasn't worth opening the mailbox for. So please, if you love your family, do not bring this horid attempt at a movie into your home."
2,Severed......,"With a title like Severed and being a horror movie fan, I bought this movie. A bit disappointing. Some voodo, but basically the movie is about a FBI agent who sets out to destroy a serial killer they name the Head Hunter. The Head Hunter is known for decapitating people and must be stopped. There is some gore in this movie but overall, a bad attempt to make a good horror flick. I bought this movie cheap, thank goodness but I would recommend anyone interested in this film to rent it! and not spend the money to buy it!"
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,"I'm tempted to write some clever exaggeration about how bad this was... but this film is not worth the effort. Instead, I will stick to the facts. I am over 50 years old, but this is the first movie that I was unable to view in its entirety. I was only able to tolerate 15 minutes or so. And I even like ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians""."
2,OFF WITH THEIR HEADS,"First of all, this movie is so poorly lit it's hard to tell what's going on most of the time. The plot or what little there is centers on a serial killer who is actually some kind of voodoo god, who goes around decapitating people..sometimes the people he beheads are worthless people; other times he just grabs somebody because he needs a soul. Matt Green (who also directed VICIOUS) employs little true suspense, settling for a couple of long pointless foot chases, a hilarious ATV chase and the obligatory car chase that is about as exciting as My Mother the Car. Vanessa Sanchez, Peter Reh, Nehemiah and Mark Harris are the stars and their acting abilities together couldn't equal one Sasha Mitchell (and he's pretty bad). The only reason for 2 stars is the movie does manage a neat twist at the end. Otherwise, SEVERED joins the list of movies that Mystery Theater wouldn't even have fun with."
1,sever this movie,"This has got to be one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time. I was mad I wasted my time watching it, as a matter of fact I turned it off half way through. There is no budget and no attempt to even try to make this movie look good or interesting or even watchable in any way. The writing, directing, acting and special effects are all bad, real bad. The only mystery here is how this movie ever got released and disributed in the first place. If you want 2 hours severed from your life then buy this movie."
1,Put it down and back away,"Wow, it's scary.......to think that this movie actually made it on video. If this movie scares you,I'd bet X-files makes you (wet) your pants. This movie probably cost how much you pay for it. Please, spend your money on something that's worth an hour and a half of your life."
1,A useless book...,"May be this book has an academic value, but it is completely useless as a reference: no photographs, no prices, and not too much of other information (the book is very thin, BTW)."
4,It would have gotten 5 stars if...,"...only it were wireless. Honestly, the Xbox 360 has spoiled me to wireless controllers. Other than that, this stick is rock solid. Hori makes quality arcade sticks, and for only $60, it's quite a steal!"
1,Horrible phone,"While it sounds like this phone has horrible reception, it actually appears to be a design flaw in the receive side on the phone line. Either way, you get to listen to static (other people hear you fine) and this is the worst sounding phone I've ever heard. Avoid this phone at all costs as it is much worse than the discount cordless phones you see from time to time.Good ergonomics though. Hopefully Target will take this back.Jason"
2,So quiet I can't hear anyone - though it's crystal-clear,"With the volume turned all the way up to 4, I can barely hear the person I'm talking to. I had similar problems with my previous GE (2.4 GHz), but this is even worse - even adding a headset turned up to its full volume didn't help. Otherwise the call quality is really clear, but what's the point if it's too quiet?"
4,Trillin's unanswered questions a disappointing cop-out,"Calvin Trillin sets the stage for a potentially fascinating expose; however, he fails to deliver when he leaves the most important question unanswered. Why did Denny kill himself? It is understandable that an author could take the position of ""no one will ever know,"" but Trillin points out that he had a chance to know. This is evidenced by his quote from one of Denny's recent acquaintances ""Roger would have said you didn't know him at all."" Come on, Calvin, that was your chance. Get to know Denny and fill us in. It is anticlimactic to get to know Denny in the 50's era so well, and then be left totally in the cold about the end of his life, and who he ultimately became."
2,a guilt-trip without any real perceptiveness,"I thought its only purpose was to assuage the author's own guilt about his lack of perceptiveness of the real Denny when they were in school together. I think Denny would have hated it. Unlike a true biography, there was no depth to the analysis. The whole thing was one Big Chill session -- an experience that is better in person (or at the movies). I do agree that the contrast between the 50s and today was interesting, but not surprising."
3,Should Have Been a New Yorker Article,"Calvin Trillin's examination of the spectacular youth and troubled adulthood of his college idol, Denny, is at first an engaging look at the gee-wiz idealism of 1950's Ivy Leaguers, but quickly becomes a tiresome guilt trip. Trillin's worship of his friend borders on the homoerotic. His obssessive need to keep Denny as a symbol kept Trilling from seeing Denny as he really was when living, and now keeps him him from realizing that the details of Denny's life are not as endlessly fascinating to the world as they are to Trillin himself. To the extent that Denny's plight reflects the repressive culture of the 1950's Trillin has the germ of a fine feature article, but a note attached to the book by a friend to whom I had loaned it sums it up nicely: ""Made it to page 100. Couldn't take any more about Denny."""
2,"What's the point, Calvin?","Calvin Trillin starts out writing that anyone who speaks at a funeral wants to speak about himself as much as the deceased. He then goes on to talk about himself and his deceased college friend Denny. Anyone who understands that you never really know anyone entirely and that we all have secrets, great and small, will not learn anything from this book."
2,Disappointing/dreary/dull,"Yeesh! A whole book about a guy who had trouble living up to others' expectations is too much. Yes, Roger/Denny had it rough, he 'failed' when others expected great success, but so what? Isn't that what most of us go through to one degree or another? Thank goodness very few of us have author-friends who will bore the pants off the reading public by flaying our private lives for the whole world to ogle."
4,rumination on lost hopes,"THis is a very good story of the American dream gone wrong, of an Ivy leaguer who failed to live up to his own expectations and promise and who had many secrets. Take it or leave it, depending on your taste, but I loved it.From my own school experience, I knew lots of kids like this: they assume the world is waiting for them and make some grim discoveries about how hard it is to make it out there. For Denny, because the story at school occured largely before the questioning of the sixties, the descent to mediocrity was much much harder. (The historical asides on Yale in the 1950s are a fascinating subtheme of the book, as is the building of a career.) Many people will experience a kind of Schadenfreude at his story - handsome wonder boy losing - but it was tragic to me.Trillin is a wonderful writer, perceptive and sensitive, funny, ironic. He deserves his place in American letters.Warmly recommended."
3,Check out from library instead,"This book is ok. Once you realize the same basic shape is in all of the vests you start looking at the shoulder shaping instead. I did not care for her gauge example on several vests, same number of cast on stitches just change needle size! Also, doesn't really address sizes out of the ""normal"" ranges. Nor does it explain how to knit a vest with your gauge, pattern etc. to fit your size."
2,Folk Vest,"Photographs of the vests are beautiful, only wish the gauges worked. I tried the Bookworm vest and ended up searching the internet for corrections. I recommend, before knitting patterns, search for corrections."
2,Problems figuring out the standard sizes of the yarn specified,"I was so looking forward to getting this book, and I loved it until I tried figuring out what yarns to use. I contacted the author, and she wrote back, but her answer didn't really help me. I still have the problem of finding yarn near where I live that I can use for these folk vests. Maybe adding a hassle-free place online at her website that gives the standard weights (numbers 1-6) would be helpful. I like to handle the wool personally rather than ordering.The patterns themselves are beautiful, and, outside of that (big) problem, the descriptions and instructions are nicely done."
2,Finally received a refund,"I do not know how to take the other review I posted off so I am putting this one on too.Thank you for sending my refund, I just now received it.Lori"
1,I wish I could recommend this one but I can't,"I put this DVD on and within the first 15 minutes I said huh?! Wait a minute...who are these people and what's going on here? This is low budget, thrown together, amateur stuff. Story continuity is somewhat missing; in fact the story is somewhat missing. It has It's cute moments that the kids may get a charge out of. There are some attempts at comedy. You'll see some familiar places that will amuse you if you have ever been to Tweetsie Railroad and the North Carolina mountains. Would I get it again?... No way unless the kids just begged for it."
3,Not as good as the book.,"I grew up reading the Mandie books in the 80's and was so excited to see a movie come out. The acting wasn't great in the first one, and I have to say I thought this one was worse. I like the story-line, but it could have been better done."
3,Okay...,"I wish it played longer, and played more than one song. Also wish it had 4 different animals on it, intead of 2 birds and 1 giraffe's. Could be more exciting to look at!I bought it because it matches our daughters bedroom set. If I had known it only played one song for 3 minutes, I wouldn't have bought it. It wasn't cheap either!I probably would not recommend this to anyone...kind of disappointed in the product."
1,Wish it was about one and not four,"This book had the potential to be really good but it totally missed the mark. Its the story about 4 woman who get together in a support group for breast cancer and how they deal with it in their lives. If the story had centered around the life and turmoil of one main character rather than giving a disjointed glimpse into all four, I think it would have been a five star book. Because the women in the story are interesting and I would have loved to have gotten to know them better. It seemed like the moment you got a glimpse into who one of the characters was something happened in the book that took the story somewhere confusing and unexpected. Unexpected in a bad way. Too many things happened and I found myself having to go back and re-read to catch up. The only reason I would buy another of Ms. Stone's novels is because I could see the potential for a good book, but I don't think it was worth the price I paid."
2,Doesnt ring true,"In his introduction McCarver thanks about five people for editing and feedback. It would have been a good idea if one of them had been English. Time and time again he shows his lack of knowledge about basic things in England. Police had truncheons not nightsticks, a car is full of petrol not gas. Really irritating is when he must have heard a word in a movie but doesnt know how its spelt.Eg when somebody is going crazy they are Barmy not Balmy.The actual story isnt up to much but it is reasonably entertaining. If McCarver sticks to writing mysteries set in the USA he'll do a lot better"
4,Strong but lovely,"So, it smells like a spicy mix that does come off a bit strong. However, it settles down and becomes quite lovely after a few minutes. Shipping did take a bit over a week but it arrived packaged nicely."
3,I decided to try a new Samba scent...,"It's ok, but not for me, personally. A little strong. I will stick with the original Samba or Samba Kiss."
1,"Elvis, the King...","I bought this tape and don't want to see it again. Why? because I like Elvis and on this tape there is no Elvis only a few pictures, (of course very handsome)and comments bla bla bla. If you like to watch Elvis Don't buy this tape. But if you want to hear about Elvis, some comments you can buy it.However I DO NOT recommend this tape ' cause I love Elvis since I was a child & I want to see him...AH! there are only 30 minutes aprox.Conchita F."
4,Union Troops fight on,"Second book in an eight book series; the 35th Maine continues its fight to free the descendants of humans brought to another world from the slavery and appetites of the degnerate barbarians whose ancestors once ruled the galaxy. Larger and stronger than a human; the only hope humanity has is the technical know-how and dedication of the Union troops who were dropped into their world while on a transport for a mission off of North Carolina.The first book ended when the Yankees and Rus, descended from Russians taken when they were being converted to Christianity, barely survive an attack from the Turgar horde. In this book they face a larger horde led by an experienced and canny leader who understands the threat the new Republic and the ideas of freedom represents to his people."
4,"Entertaining, but a bit drawn out","Not a bad book, but not as good as Rally Cry. It's almost the same theme replayed in a different setting. Still, it manages to hold the reader's attention. If you have no knowledge of battle tactics you will by the end of the book"
2,Still don't buy it.,"In the first book they say the only way they are able to create industries quickly is because they brought tools with them. In this book Cromwell with just his ship crew, one regiment deserter and a few ex-peasants from the city and whatever he had onboard for equipment and whatever he got from the French Pirates is able to do his own industrial revolution in 1.5 years.Don't really buy being able to build ironclads out of railroad tracks and engines in 15 days either. Might be able to build galleys in 30 days but even that is a stretch.Granted the spar torps were a nice idea. I would consider it more plausible to have used spar torps on galleys in the first place instead of building ironclads in 15 days..."
2,Patronizing title,"What's next--""Basic Manuals for Friends of the Black""? Wouldn't information about resources, adaptive technology and the ADA be useful for the disabled person too? I can't comment on the content of the book, but I think the title is patronizing and ridiculous."
3,Doesn't quite gel,"I've liked all of Sean Stewart's other books, but this one disappointed me. All the usual elements were there, but somehow they didn't fit together right. The ending didn't provide any real resolution. If you're new to Stewart, read Mockingbird instead - I think it's his best. This one has the same setting as Resurrection Man and Night Watch, and I think those are both better."
3,Magical Realism meets Science Fiction,"The clever conceit of Galveston is that magical realism, made literal, can become the basis for science-fiction / fantasy. Stewart imagines Galveston after a storm of magic overtakes the island. ""Prawn men"" wander the jetties with fleshy mustaches hanging over and under their lips, hearts are squeezed into dolls that then take on life, and century old ghosts hold office and lead people around with their icy touch. Magic demands no credibility because it is firmly beyond question. Magical realism, in contrast, has never been that real or that commonplace. And, to me, what works imaginatively doesn't work literally. Magical realism swims between the metaphoric and the actual and a reader cannot know which it is. The world is bathed in surreal light. Stewart's world, in comparison, seems costumed, the end of a ""what if"" story. While the Stewart's fictional world is exciting and, in places, evocative, it is ultimately much too easy to describe and explain."
4,A promising author delivers his best yet,"Stewart delivers a vivid tapestry of a city assaulted by the release of magic into the world. Continuing on themes he's developed in previous books, Stewart turns his attention towards the fascinating island city of Galveston, a city with two sides.The first side is that of an almost post-apocalyptic city. One in which civilisation has started to collapse and the surviviors struggle to make do with the remains of technology and rapidly dwindling 'comforts.' The other side is of a Carnival that never ends, where the magic lives, ruled by a god named Momus. In between are a handful of women and men who try to keep the two sides as apart as they can.The clash of magic and modenr society has always been one of Stewart's main themes, but here, for the first time. he's created a story and characters which are fully as interesting as his themes. This brings to mind the best of Charles De Lint's books."
2,All that is gold does not glitter. . .,I bought this book based in large part on online reviews (Amazon) and the cover art. It was a large mistake. The maps supplied are two color and lack imagination and luster. Further the rectangular size of the book made the maps small and pointless. On the left hand page is a small snippet about the map on the right hand side. The text is rarely more than a paragraph leaving every left hand page half blank. This book was poorly thought out and I do not reccomend it.
5,Exactly as advertised,"This product was exactly as described. It came earlier than was promised, so I was extremely pleased with National."
1,Thin and unwearable,"This is something I'd expect to find at ... a cheap discount store. Not what I wanted nor will I wear it. Material is practically see through,"
2,too heavy,"Both of my babies were not interested in these animals, they are quite big and heavy for a baby. They are very cute and my baby and I love the textures and noises they make and all the fun colors, but they are too big for my baby to play with."
5,Great Book & Even Greater Service,"Prior to reading this book I felt I had a very good idea of what landing a pharmaceutical job would take. After reading the book I quickly realized that I may have been giving myself a bit too much credit. The Manger Surveys, sample interview questions, brag book suggestions, and follow-up chapters are the one's I found most informative. This book definitely taught me techniques that will help me stand out from the crowd both before and after securing an interview.The service provided by Lisa Alexander and her staff have also been excellent. I have e-mailed Lisa and her staff approximately four times since completing the book and have received a reply within 24 hours every time. The questions she has answered and tips she has offered me via e-mail alone are worth the $29.95 I paid for the book.I definitely recommend this book to anyone that is serious about entering the Pharmaceutical Sales Industry."
2,Below average,"Other books are much better and have more information that is better formatted and explained. 'The Insider's guide to the world of pharmaceutical sales' is an excellent resource that I would recommend. Also, I liked '3 days to a pharmaceutical sales job interview'. This book may not get you an interview in 3 days, but it is an excellent book to prepare for an interview. It does a good job explaining how to sell a pen, as well as the STAR format used to answer situational questions."
2,Not a big fan,"I bought 6 books about Pharm sales, this was my least favorite. I don't like the way it is written (format of the text)I did not find any information in this book that can support the high price."
5,A must read for athletes and their parents.,"The recruiting process is so confusing, that athletes and their parents (who are going through the process for the first time) need to learn the reality of recruiting. This book explains the problems with getting your child noticed and how to overcome them. Plus, it was written by a former college coach who knows first hand what recruiting is like."
2,What a disappointment!,"After the mention the book received in the U.S. World & News Report college guide, I expected much more. The book is very basic, and very small. It is way overpriced. It ought to be selling for about $8. You'll be able to read it in about an hour--big print, lots of white space."
4,Another Masterpiece from RPO,"Royal Philharmonic is one of my favourite orchestra, and they've done it again with this masterpiece of pop/rock re-works. Some track like Hotel California, Careless Whisper, La Isla Bonita are very good. And the others are nice also. I found myself listen to them again and again, although not as often as the ""Classic Rock"" and ""Symphonic Rock"" series from London Symphony Orchestra (LSO).However, some tracks are still not-so-good... Anyway, I think this one still worth listening, and deserved 4 stars from me."
2,Euphoria is wearing off,"My first exposure to this band was a live performance a few years ago, and I was swept up in the euphoria. I bought the first CD, and I thought, ""Meh, okay, so they're a LIVE band first and foremost."" I bought the second CD and was like, ""Meh, okay, so they're STILL a live band."" The included bonus DVD of a live performance was great.I saw them a few more times, and they were still pretty entertaining, but it was becoming clearer to me that the appeal was in the novelty of their appearance and the joyous presentation they gave onstage.I bought this CD, and now, I think, I'm probably done buying Polyphonic Spree CDs. Kurt Cobain is turning over in his grave, and I'm not feeling so good myself."
1,Amazon - The First Rip Off,What version is this? looks like the old collectors edition (2 discs) but it says it is not released until June 21st!The Summer Movie Comedy Cash is a shockingly bad promotion - earn money off vouchers to see 1 of 3 crap movies in the theatre! whoopee.this DVD looks like a rip off as there is nothing new. buy both and be deceived?so 1 star for Amazon (the description is totally useless) but 5 stars for the movie - just brilliant.
4,Nice discovery!,"I came across 'Soul Summit' the other day and thought it looked promising, so I bought it. I'm glad I did - this fine chunk of early Philly soul does not disappoint! Standouts: tracks 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 & 12. And judging from the Nixon Theater tracks, the Ambassadors were even better live!"
3,Ok,I guess I was expecting more tutorials with this book. It is good for newbies. If you have a general understanding of the software you might be disapointed.
4,Easy to understand,"Great book to learn 3ds max. not too wordy. great examples. You can get in deep real fast without having felt like you read a novel. This is version 8 which is older but is still totally relevant, its just that this is the last version put out by master visually.We are using this book in our class for 3ds max 2011 and everything still applies.Good Book."
2,A whole lot of miniature tutorials,"This book is full of 1-3 page long tutorials. It has tons of them. That is also the books downfall in my opinion. It explains so many features, but it covers none of them in depth because of the space it gives each part. It just generally brushes on things which deserve much more detail. There really isn't as much practical excercises as I thought would be, it's mostly load the tutorial image off the CD, apply this option, or effect and see doesn't that look great, and now on to the next one. Wash rinse repeat. How you can cover advanced subjects in a handful of pages with quickie mini tutorials is beyond me. I'm glad I got this as a gift as I would have been dissapointed had I sepnt my own money on it."
1,Didn't work at all.,"K-Hypermedia discs are manufactured by a company named CMC Magnetics. They have a reputation for having poor quality control.On my Sony DRU-500AX, I had a failure rate of 100% with this type of disc. 5 of 5 failed to complete the burn, or failed with a power calibration error before burning."
2,The Immortal (DVD),"This appeared to be some kind of pilot episode for the series at just under an hour and a half...but far from Lorenzo's best work. I'm a Lamas fan from back to the Snakeater days, and boy do I miss Renegade! (as cheesy as it was!!) This movie could have used a lot more fight scenes...not nearly as action-packed as some of his older stuff. It was more or less a new version of the Highlander. If Lorenzo Lamas wasn't in it...I certainly wouldn't have checked it out."
1,What is wrong with everyone?,"For anyone who thinks this program might be good, run as far as you can from this cheap knock-off starring Lorenzo Lamas. This is an outrageously bad rip-off of the excellent Highlander TV series. Invest your money in the Highlander DVDs, guys. Trust me. I notice that some readers think this review isn't helpful. Well, you're gonna be in for a huge surprise if you ignore my review and buy this dumb series. I have seen every Highlander film numerous times and every episode of the TV series . . . so I consider myself a Highlander expert. When I tell you the ""Immortal"" is a cheap rip off, trust me. Lorenzo Lamas is no Adrian Paul!"
1,Oh! The NEW The Immortal TV Series...,I got so excited when I read this was being released THINKING it was the ORIGINAL 'The Immortal' TV Series from the 1960's - WHAT A LETDOWN! I hadnever heard of THIS new version and I suspect there is a reason for that!
3,Mindless entertainment,"The Immortal is a pretty obscure, fairly mundane TV show that doesn't really stand out from a half dozen others it blatantly rip off. In fact, the Highlander series is probably superior in many ways, and very similar I might add. I never thought I'd catch myself paying a backhanded compliment to the syndicated Highlander series. I honestly don't know why I bought this - I really have no excuse. It basically follows the ""monster of the week"" format, and naturally features Lorenzo Lamas beating them up and then eventually stabbing them with a samurai sword. Lamas, by the way, is still basically the same character he was in ""Renegade"", only now he is immortal and brandishes a sword. However, if you're a fan of mindless entertainment and enjoy decent, ""syndicated TV show"" action - then the Immortal fits the bill."
4,The Immortal,"This is obviously the pilot of the series. It really wasn't bad at all, though obviously totally based on the Highlander series. The special effects could have been better but there was a lot of humor and I liked the characters.Unfortunately this is only the pilot movie, the series itself doesn't seem to have been released on dvd yet, which is disapointing.You will not find anything scary in this movie at all, and I don't think you are meant to. There is some action, some angst, and some humor though."
3,Crikies! Believe the editors' caveat!!,"Lovely that this book has been republished for posterity. However, heed the editor's warning when they say this is a reprint with an""occasional blurred page or... poor picture."" Change that to ""almost every page"" and ""ALL are poor pictures"" and you'll have a more accurate description. Not entirely unreadable, just prepare to squint to catch the text. The photos are hopeless: pixelated and washed out. Better than nothing, (but poo!), makes me sad. :("
2,Too big,"I think all the amazing animals are super cute, my baby and I love all the colors and textures and sounds. I don't however think that they a good baby toys, they are just too big and heavy for a baby to play with and enjoy on his or her own. I got these when my son was a baby and he was never into them, now I have a baby girl and she doesn't like to play with them either. I don't recommend these toys."
2,Sitting in the toybox...,"I thought this toy was adorable when my sister sent it for my baby boy. He got it at about 6 months old and he liked the colors and played with it often. The older he got the less he played with it. He's 23 months now and hasn't played with it in about a year.IMO it was a waste of money, it didn't have any longevity. Oh well, it was a gift."
1,Cute but doesn't entertain,"This little panda is cute! He has little rainbow colored balls in his paws for baby to shake. However, this toy lives in my son's toybox. For whatever reason, he just does not pay attention to it. This toy really doesn't provide any fun entertainment other than a small rattling sound. I would not recommend this amazing animal."
4,Surprisingly Refreshing,"This film by first-time feature director Michael A. Pinckney has notably refreshing elements and is definitely worth a watch.The acting is good - especially the performances of the two police officers investigating the case, who become noticeably more natural with one another as they continue to pursue the killer. The chemistry in the budding romantic relationship between the younger officer and the young woman who works at a hip-hop magazine is also believable and fun to watch.The play with racial roles is also refreshing, and helps to evade cliched stereotypes - both black and white characters can relate to hip-hop based on who they are as individual characters, rather than based on their race. It is also refreshing to see rap and rappers treated with an appreciation for all of their manifestations and effects, rather than simply being glorified or demonized. The film treats these subjects with humor and self-awareness.I look forward to seeing more from this director!"
2,Bad Acting....Dumb Plot,"Typical overdone ""There's a serial killer on the loose..."" type of story. Movie had potential to be much better, but with bad acting and a lot of no-name actors; the movie fell flat. Some parts I found to be totally laughable. Then.....once the killer is revealed, you'll be left thinking, ""WTF?"" Seriously??? It seems as if they took an episode from Law & Order, and tried to hip-hop it up a little. There is one rapper in the movie who becomes the target for murder; and instead of taking precautions, he's out doing club gigs. Not only that; but according to the storyline, he's a PLATINUM selling artist! What platinum artist does rinky-dink club gigs, especially if they know they've already been shot at, AND is still the target for murder??? Again....laughable. The only one in the movie who seemed to have had more knowledge with regards to ""the hood"" and being ""gangsta,"" was the white cop."
4,Terrific performances by 2 capable performers,"I'd like to find out more about these 2 performers. Both gentlemen play stylishly, but the CD notes tell us absolutely nothing about them. I love some Schubert piano sonatas [e.g. the A major one D. 664], whereas others sound long and meandery to me.But this posthumous C Minor sonata is enjoyable, especially the opening movement.Rosel performs the Mozart K 570 stylishly. This is an interesting sonata, with the last movement in Rondo-Sonata form.I had not previously heard any Schumann sonatas, which is one reason for listening to this CD. It is a short, pleasant work, worth getting to know."
1,um...what else is on?,I wasted my money on this garbage and I learned 2 very imporant lessons:all men are pigs and all women are victims. This piece of dumpster food is only fodder for feminazis.
1,interesting but theoretically derivative,The thesis underlying this book is quite innovative but I found the theoretical discourses rather derivative. The books is a mosaic of ideas of others and it's hard for me to distinguish what is original and what is derivative.
5,Works great every time !,Prev I had a charcoal smoker -- my results were always random -- with this unit --- perfect outcome every time -- and you can completely leave unit unattended -- mingle with your party/guests -- return at projected completion time -- and great results! I highly recommend this prdct
4,Like it do not Love it..,"I purchased the six rack digital three weeks ago. I have only done two smokes so far. I am disappointed on the heat recovery times. Empty it preheats great, but put ten pounds of beef in it and it will take two hours to get back up to 200 degrees. There are a few after market solutions for this but it shouldn't have to be. Bradley should be all over this design flaw. It's great for lower heat smoking like sausage and bacon, but you will be disappointed if you put a brisket or pork shoulder in it and want to get to 225 degrees quickly."
3,The flexibility to control temperature and smoke...wow good,"but....the plastic parts in some key spots and really crappy quality of the smoker construction makes this a bit pricey for what you get. We had plastic start to break off on the 3rd use, and the door was bent and then broken off between the 12th-15th use. We are not beating this thing up; it's just not quality construction. They need to make a better smoker box...period. Comes with a 1 year warranty, but if they offer an extended warranty, GET IT! You will end up needing it...."
4,"I like it, I like it, want some more of it.",Smoked a turkey for Thanksgiving. Did great. Smoked cheeses and sausages are on the list for next attempts.
1,Worst purchase ever,"We bought this smoker from Reds Gear on Amazon. It's terrible!! It will not reach 320 degrees as it claims to. In fact, it barely reaches 240. Also, if you set the smoker for lets say an hour, and the oven for 5 hours, it will stop heating when the smoker part turns off. So basically the oven is pointless. When I called Bradley to tell them it doesn't work, they gave me all this crappy advice, which we had already tried. Also, they said to remove the bisquettes and leave the smoker running with the oven. So they flat out admitted that this was a problem but took the easy way out by saying the oven will work if you run the smoker at the same time. I will never buy another Bradley product. Plain and simple, this product is just not what the company claims it to be. Bradley 6-rack Digital Smoker, you're being returned!"
4,Bradley Smoker Customer Service Helpful,Had a problem with the unit not getting hot enough. One call to Bradley's customer service and I had a replacement heating element in a matter of days. Now that's what I call customer service! Also got their cold-smoke box accessory...that works great! I do wish they could correct the biscuits to load all the time. Sometimes they don't slide in on their own.
1,Low quality,"This is a s**tbox, smoker died after about 15 sessions for no reason.Worked ok while lasted.Very bad quality yet pricey."
2,heating element,The smoker worked great until!! on the first outing the heating element quit in the middle of smoking 25lbs of salami. They did overnight a new element saying they had some defective elements and charged me for the shipping. Nice!!
2,Vastly under heated,This smoker has the same watts on the heater as the 4 rack smoker. It just doesn't have the umph to get hot enought to properly smoke meat properly when loaded fully. I bought this from another vendor but have nothing but disdain for this piece of junk put out by Bradley. It also has widely swinging temps if you only do a couple of racks of ribs. +- 20 degrees. Totally not acceptable.If you want a Bradley stay with the 4 rack size.
2,"NOT Rhinotek, but works OK so far","I purchased this cartridge versus the other HP 4200 compatible cartridges based on the Rhinotek name. The cartridge I received, however, has no Rhinotek branding anywhere and looks to be your average no-name knock-off. This is not acceptable. Having said that, I really needed the cartridge so I gave it a try and the print quality seems fine. I only hope it lasts the 12000 pages it's supposed to. If you're looking for a cheap cartridge that does the job, this might work out just fine for you. For myself, I'm not impressed by companies that get me to buy under false pretences, and won't be buying from OCProducts again."
1,Not so good,"As a naturalist and native of New Zealand, I was eager to purchase this book about one of my favorite New Zealand creatures, the kea. I must, however, express my disappointment. This book is not only flawed in places (especially concerning the kea's behavior), but it is also exceedingly dry."
1,Wait for the movie,Forced to read this for a project - couldn't. I made up stuff rather than finishing this. Not too pleasant experience. go buy a parot instead. Its probably less anoying.
4,"Good, but far from perfect","Mark Waid here envisions a world where evil, in this case a supervillain named Golgoth and his superhuman allies, has won. Golgoth is now emperor of the world. However, pockets of resistance and the internal backstabbing of his ministers still plague him.The story was good and played out well. Golgoth is an excellently-developed character in the mold of Darth Vader or Dr. Doom. The plot twists were very well-thought-out. However, a lot of the supporting cast, like Xanna, Kafra, and Lucullan, were annoying. In addition, Delfi makes a complete 180-degree character shift that results in some very...gross...scenes. In addition, there were some needless elements in the story, like the inclusion of the Qaron. Overall, however, Empire is a read well worth your time."
3,Enjoyed ... but left me hanging out there,"Ok, I will be the first to admit that I am a sucker for a well written graphic novel ... and this is indeed one such well written graphic novel. Mark Waid has been a favorite of mine for quite some time, and so I anticipated reading this since the date I purchased it. And Kitson's art was pretty darn impressive. Yet, however interesting the story started out and continued to be as I progressed ... I just didn't feel a full ""completeness"" to the entire story arc ... and found too many loose threads for my taste in the end. Perhaps this feeling derives from the very core history in the story of how ""Empire"" came to be picked up by DC, but I would not re-read this title. Great escapist entertainment for an evening, but I am already looking to pass it on and out of my permanent collection. Thanks Mr. Waid/Mr. Kitson for the effort, just fell a little flat."
5,Lovely book,"My students with ASD even like this book and can make sense of the story. Good pictures, lovely tale about animals."
1,Difficult to follow,"I am very disappointed with this book and will return it. The type is tiny, and to make it worse, the author chose a font that is very light -- making it even more difficult. I don't think it is very well organized, either. There are much better books out there on the creative use of InDesign."
1,Very Disappointing,"The type in this book is just too small to read. It's also sans-serif and very light. Even with a magnifying glass, 5 pt. type is just too small to be read easily. The design is scattered and distracting. Differences in leading for no apparent reason. Too hard to read. Is the information good? Probably, but it is made inaccessible by the size and lightness of the type. A waste of money. Also discovered that it covers CS2, and I have had CS3 for quite a while now. Update and Redesign with a readable font, please!"
3,Hand held,I have had this phone for 3 years without problem but now the hand held will not work and I am being told that the whole phone and base must be repurchased. This is wrong and very poor service.
1,Does it even try to be funny?,"I am aware that there is a left leaning daily cartoon that runs in most comic sections. I am aware that this left leaning cartoon tends to upset conservatives. However, this unmentioned comic is at least funny, sometimes. I can honestly say, that I have never ever cracked a smile reading Mallard Fillmore. It does not even try to be funny, seriously. It is just a token right wing strip, balancing the comic page political spectrum. I have no problem with laughing at the right or the left, but come on, tell a joke. All Fillmore seems to do is blast Democrats, but with no creativity or subtlety. I mean, I know it must feel good to be a conservative and know that there is a comic out there that blasts the other side. But aren't comics supposed to make you laugh?"
2,Neither funny nor intelligent,"This only reinforces the stereotype that conservatives have no sense of humour. Tinsley often recycles the same ""joke"" four or five times in a row. The political commentary is so removed from reality (liberal media bias? Ever watched Fox News?) that it falls flat in that department too."
1,yawn.,"Mallard Fillmore is the most unfunny comic strip of all time. Although I almost never agree with its politics, that's not my real problem with it. My real problem is that it takes one [bad] joke and repeats it with slightly different wording every single day for a week or longer. And the jokes are almost never funny to begin with. The only funny thing about Mallard Fillmore is laughing at how unfunny it is.And besides, although Tinsley may seem to think he's wickedly skewering liberals, his satire is trite and predictable. He rarely strays from the obvious targets - political correctness, Clinton, self-absorbed news anchors. Yawn. It's all been done before by far cleverer satirists."
1,"only funny to ideologues, I guess","There's a reason why this book is out of print: an utter lack of wit, originality, or humor. Here's the basic premise of every single strip: put something that conservative pundits have said into speech balloons, then draw a few ducks around them. See, it's really funny to see a duck saying ""Reagan increased revenues by cutting taxes."" Ha ha ha.I mean, I'd really like to see a genuinely witty and thoughtful conservative comic strip. This isn't it."
2,If only it were just a little funny,"Bruce Tinsley believes that the conservative point of view is woefully under-represented in the funny pages, and I suppose he may be right in that. But Tinsley, in his drive to illustrate his viewpoint, along the way has forgotten to include the humor that is necessary.I suppose one could level that same criticism at the current crop of Doonesbury cartoons which seem to have lost their focus, but in its heyday, the strip was indeed funny & readable. Doonesbury also took aim at targets on both ends of the spectrum on a regular basis. This is an area in which ""Mallard Fillmore"" is sorely lacking.The idea that either the liberal or conservative ideologies has alone cornered the market on absurdity is ludicrous. A good satirist will target absurdity on both sides of the spectrum, and until Tinsley recognizes this, he will be nothing more than a partisan writer of cartoon polemics."
1,"Come on conservatives, is this the best you can do?","This strip is a perfect example of the conservative tool Thomas Franks calls the Plen-T-Plaint. Lists of liberal excesses are made, and tongues are clucked over them, and we're all supposed to take that as evidence that culture is being run and destroyed by liberals.It's not that Tinsely never has a point. Many of the liberal excesses he illustrates are stupid, and a scant few of them aren't even trivial isn't-it-dumb-when-everyone-gets-a-trophy stuff. But he neither has anything funny to say about them nor a funny way to present them. He just trots them out and proudly leaves them lying there, like a cat who leaves dead animals on your pillow.I guess if you're conservative, there aren't very many comic strips for you to pick from. This one is probably better than the Family Circus, but you might at least step up to the Wizard of Id or B.C., which aren't that great either but at least include detecible levels of humor and aren't so pouty."
1,Funny As A Heart Attack,"This is a perfect gift for someone who thinks that Rush Limbaugh is the most astute political commentator since Joseph Goebbels. Its biggest sin isn't its tired, stereotypical political conservatism...its the fact that it is simply unfunny. Tinsley mines the same joke for four or five strips, with rarely a pay-off of any note or worth. The most hilarious thing about Mallard Fillmore is how it claims to be the ""conservative"" answer to Doonesbury, but the fact of the matter is that Trudeau is not only funnier and more perceptive, but, ironically, is much harder and brutal on people like Clinton than Tinsely could ever hope to be. This book is pathetic."
1,Utterly despicable,"I personally am not a liberal, but an anarcho-socialist, but I can still attest to this cartoon's utter worthlessness. Tinsley lacks the skill of satire to be a sucessful political cartoonist, so he instead rants out this strip, he which he basically moans and whines about things he dislikes, namely them pesky liberals and their like-minded ilk. Tinsley's work is almost immediatley offputting, being totally cruel, (and sarcasm, even when carried to the 10th degree, can be funny) idiotically overblown exagerration, and the simple fact that everyone on the right does not really have a sense of humor, and is instead simply pompous, ignorant, and puffed full of righteous indignation. About as funny as a golf club between the eyes. I would recommend 'The Boondocks', as well as classics like ""Krazy Kat' and 'Calvin and Hobbes' instead. up with the surrealist revolution."
5,Frag's Ass,"Fiction with its roots in truth. For some of us the hammer is always falling and the hammer falls hardest on the unprotected. In the case of Frag's Ass it's the psychologically weak. But, they have their hero. With ironic humor, and snide social commentary frag's delivers. With cleverness, and some cruelty, we see the bad and the heroic go down, but rescue and retribution neverthe less achieved.Tough, gfritty, relevent. I recommend Frag's-(no matter whose side you're on now)."
3,They're okay,Decent enough. Not packaged well enough though. Two of the shoes had small chunks out of the side of the lining.
1,Mis-attribution,"Fans of David Oistrakh will be disappointed. The performer is his son, Igor, and the Amazon database is wrong."
3,Get Your Furniture Patterns Here,"The title implies that there is a ""dream home"" pattern in this book. Sorry, no. There's everything you need to furnish a home that would delight any child but not one house to put everything in.Now if you are looking for furniture patterns in plastic canvas, this is the book for you. The living room, bedroom, laundry, bathroom, and patio are all here. Add the camper with accessories, you'll have tons to make for your fashion doll fan.So for me - who was looking for a house pattern - this book is a disappointment, but for you - who might be looking for furniture patterns - this book could be a gold mine. So enjoy!"
2,Ancient but has some good info,"This book is an antique and is interesting in terms of historical background. But mostly I bought it because it has some excellent info on basic principles of cohesion, coupling, etc."
4,A book for entrepreneurs by an entrepreneur,"This is an excellent book, because it is written by somebody who is a practising entrepreneur.The author understands the real issues facing the entrepreneurs because he is doing it everyday.Some of the stories and examples really resonated with me because I too have experienced the trials and tribulations of being an entrepreneur.Particularly like the entrepreneurial language i.e., beg borrow befriend, roughing it at the start. Which really describes the processes entrepreneurs use in practice, much better than the traditional business speak.I recommend this book to every business person."
5,A wonderful regency romp,"I was thrilled to see that this was released on Kindle. And I have to say, the story holds up very well. I first read the story when it first came out in hardcover, nearly eight years ago, and I enjoyed it a lot then.I read it again last month, after it was released on Kindle, and enjoyed at least as much as I had the first time--possibly more. Being older and (theoretically) wiser has not diminished my pleasure in Kate, Cecilia, their spouses, or their adventures. If anything, I got even more out of it this time, having read a number of regency novels during the intervening years. This series may be marketed to teens (and it's certainly suitable for them), but it's a wonderful romp for adults as well."
3,Not as Good as the First Book,"I didn't like this one nearly as much as the first one. For one thing, it's a LOT longer, so it seems like it rambles through the plot until things start happening. For another, I kept getting the characters confused. There are a lot of secondary characters, true, but I mean I got the *main* characters confused. It's told in two points of view, and I had a hard time remembering which of the girls I was currently reading. In the first book, this didn't happen often because they are in different locations writing letters back and forth, but in this book, they're in the same location and often are remarking on the same events. So, I was often flipping back a few pages to try to remember which point of view I was currently in."
4,errrrm,"Well This book is a good read Infact my mom Knows Patricia the auther I liked how the Girls bring their ""odis"" Husbands and how the poor men have to suffer thru their wifes serching for bad wizards and that sort of thing. Cecy did not seem to have alot of a relationship with her husband and the book was confusing to keep up with but overall a delicous read!!!Please enjoy, and hopefully they'll change the cover artist to the artis in the first book!!-HGA"
4,Enjoyable Regency fantasy,"This is the another book set in a Regency period in which magic is part of everyday life, and magicians are everywhere. Cousins Kate and Cecy (the heroines of 'Sorcery and Cecelia) are now married and are on their honeymoon with their husbands James and Thomas. As they travel across Europe, mysterious things begin to happen. There are several murders, and various magical objects go missing. Kate, Cecy, and their husbands have to try and find out what is going on and how to stop it. This is a lively story with good characters and plenty of humour and excitement, but there are rather too many sentimental scenes between the married couples, which are a bit of a bore. On the whole, I agree with the previous reviewers who say this is not as much fun as the earlier book, but it is still an entertaining read."
2,Not worth the time,"While Wrede and Stevermer have a decent plot going on, this lacks just about everything that made Sorcery and Cecelia wonderful. The plot doesn't come together nearly so nicely in this book, and the end feels as though even the authors were getting tired of stringing it along. The book has some nice historical aspects, but is far too drawn out. The characters are starting to become annoying, and differences in the authors writing styles start causing the pieces to clash. They even left a few things unexplained. I look forward to adding Sorcery and Cecelia to my collection, but if you wish to read The Grand Tour, try checking it out in the library first."
3,Prefiguring Orrie's Downfall,"Rex Stout was of the old school. Character flaws, so much celebrated in Nero Wolfe himself, will inevitably bring down his characters...Orrie Cather ultimately decays completely in later Nero Wolfe stories, and here his decline is foretold. He gets involved with a shady lady and, as a result, needs Wolfe's help to extricate himself.It's a good story, and credible, given Cather's personality. However, you start to see Stout eating his young in this one, as he'd formerly done with Marko Vukcic in ""The Black Mountain.""So, what was Orrie a nickname for, anyway?"
1,vedry boring,I hated this book. It's very boring and useless. Nero Wolf is not a real detective if others do his work for him.
3,"Good, but not in-depth overview of cisco network security","I can hardly believe that this book was written by CCIEs as it contains a lot of errors. What do you think about ""service ROUTER-encryption"" command, phrases like ""unless you are purposely using SNMP version 1, the ""snmp-server community"" command must be avoided at all costs (because it enables SNMP ver 1 instead of ver 2)"" and so on. A lot of the text was directly borrowed from cisco IOS configuration guides without any modification. And believe me, extended numbered access lists can be edited as well as named ACLs!"
1,Available free online,This is a public-domain book that an opportunist has uploaded and marked at an exorbitant price. This book is available free elsewhere online.
5,Complex British Mystery - How Cunning are you?,Ruth Rendell is an amazing British author with a wonderful talent for mystery writing. Put On By Cunning is in the Inspector Wexford series of books and is as good as it gets. It is a maddeningly complex murder story where you really need to focus and keep your wits about you. The clues are all there for the reader to see - nothing is hidden. Although to come up with what really happened will take some cunning - and don't be put on!
4,Excellent,Ruth Rendell is a master of great crime novels. Hard to put down. A complete page turner that meant inactive days and late nights.
4,Competent and smoothly rendered. A good read,"Rendell only gets better. Her characters are finely drawn and behave in believable ways, always a satisfactory element in a novel. The plot has sufficient previews that are subtle enough not to allow accurate prediction of the ending, but they are there. There is none of the improbable surprises that ruin an ending by destroying that wonderful sense of suspended disbelief. The book is a good read, well worth the time.Bettie Banks"
4,Cunning is Fetching!,"Even though this early Ruth Rendell is dated--DNA evidence today would solve the plot, which takes place at least thirty years ago, almost instantly--the novel is suspenseful and clever. Inspector Wexford has been a fine character for Rendell; his astuteness and humanity alone are enough to keep the reader interested. Definitely a good read--as just about all of Rendell or Vine's fiction is."
4,Great story!,"I read the first page and was immediately hooked -- the wooded estate on a cold snowy night, the frozen pond -- drew such a word picture I felt I was there. Chief Inspector Wexford persists in seeing murder where colleagues see accident.The story faltered a bit toward the end with a little too much going on with all the characters -- but it picked up the pace again before I'd lost interest, in time for a satisfying ending. One of Rendell's well-written stories."
4,Not to be dismissed,"It's not enough these days to deal with America's obvious enemies. So many of our ""friends"" and ""allies"" are enemies of another, less obvious stripe. Gibson uncovers the anti-American policies and hidden political agendas of France, Germany, and the most of the EU, South Korea, and Canada. To ignore this burgeoning trend in world affairs, whatever your political affliation, is to be willfully and dangerously ignorant."
1,"Another Faux News ""Reporter""","Another Faux News ""Reporter"" doing a faux book on a faux story?How original!Are there some people in the world that hate America? probably. But my guess is they love our freedom, but dislike some of our policies, like invading sovereign nations and killing thousands of civilians. Buy this book if you can't think critically, have no sense of history, believe FoxNews is balanced, and am sure that Bush43 is God's second begotten son."
1,Venomous disinformation,"oversimplistic nonsense. books like this will only serve to further disinform the american public and lead them into the neo-conservative trap. as if two wars aren't enough, here's a case for why americans should be wary and spiteful of the rest of the world. ever consider the possibility that maybe the rest of the entire world is right and america's foolish leadership is wrong?"
3,Why are we hated?,"I just have one two-part question: Why are we currently hated around the world and if the US IS hated, why weren't we hated around the world 5 years ago or 10 or even 25 years ago? I traveled overseas several times before 9/11, including to France, and never encountered any hatred directed at me or other Americans. What have we done to anger the world?Does the book address this point?"
2,Why should they hate U.S.?,"They have a higher standard of living than us, they being Europe, Great Britain, and Canada. They have free health care, have shorter work weeks,longer vacations, and stronger currencies. While I as a citizen of the U.S.of America work two jobs just to pay my taxes.I find Mr. Gibson's premise bogus."
3,"Ought to called, ""America's Paranoia of the World"".","Germany, France and Russia have always been cordial to American White House officials visiting their countries. I don't see the hate except for extremist Islamic elements.Getting flak from world leaders does NOT mean they hate America."
1,Sinking Like A Rock,"Sales of this book are sinking like a rock, due to John's faulty and simplistic premise that we are hated because we are good and the rest of the world is evil. Could not our ill-advised foreign policy have played a role? How about the fact that in the past we have supported some of the most barbaric dictators when doing so supported our interests (re: Saddam Hussein). But such honest and critical evaluation is way beyond the capacity of this author and his intended audience. So its back to the FAUX NEWS CHANNEL for John where his simplistic message is truely appreciated."
2,Clarification is required,Speaking as a Brit I can confidently say the author and reviewers of this book are misinformed. The majority of the British public don't hate America because of Bush or his reaction to 9/11. It's simpler than that. We just hate America because it's full of Americans.I hope this helps to clarify the situation for you.
1,Ridiculous!,"As bad, if not worse than Fox News. I do not recommend this book at all. I wonder if he gets paid for his propoganda or is it out of fear. You'd probably get a more 'fair and balanced' view from a toddler."
1,Just What America Needs,"Yet another book by a pretentious, out of touch right winger with no semblance of thought or analytical ability writing a disingenuous book that distorts the truth and has an overwhelming sense of self-pity. In line with the Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly line of thinking: ""you either like George W. Bush, or you hate America."" Drivel. And this moron looks like Christopher Walken's character from ""A View to a Kill."" Where does FOX News find these people?"
2,Let's Bash The French! (And Make A Buck),"Ah yes... they're ""jaleous of our Freedom""... This pretty much sums up the Neocon's incredibly profound views of a world where if they disagree with us, well... they must ""hate"" us. It's that simple. Mr Gibson's book does America a disservice by exactly portraying the negative stereotype of the ""naive"" and ""simplistic"" American."
1,I just had to respond,"This book is simply another U.S. jingoist view of the world. It claims that consumers and the viewers of media are sponges who cannot think for themselves. Individuals form their own opinions, and if they hate America, yes, undoubtedly their media has shown a biased opinion of us, like our media does every single day, but they still see the effects of our imperialism in their own lives and form opinions from that. This book uses the antiquated idea of barbarianism, that those in other countries, especially countries that do not speak english, are obviously less intelligent than people here and are simply ignorant masses waiting to be told how to think. Any educated American who thinks that is the ignorant one.Also, I can not help but respond to that last review, by the right-winged Californian. FRANCE wouldn't be here if not for the U.S.? What about where we would be if not for France? Take a history class."
1,A question of cost,"This is just a question: why is the price for this book $63.63? Let me know if it was just a typo, please."
1,Priced Too High! Don't buy here.,"toys r us sells this item online for 7.99, and it appears to be in stock. Why is this tiger selling for $25-$40?"
1,Pricing WAY Out Of Whack,"Check your pricing on all items. As of late, our family has noticed many items listed on Amazon being severely price gouged. My 6 month old daughter absolutely loves this tiger and it's sad to see it being priced so high on Amazon. I found this item on the shelf at our local Target for $6.99. I'm not one to usually write negative reviews but these high prices are being found all over Amazon lately."
3,Amazing Animals Tiger - Heavy duty fun but....,"Loved the tiger but it came broken with no sound... and at the individual price of around 14 a broken toy didn't make me happy... Not sure if everyone is having this problem... Have the polar bear, giraffe, elephant, monkeys, and horse and are thrilled with them even after really playing with them hard..."
4,Human Error,Excellent look at human error. I read it from a healthcare perspective and found the concepts powerful. I will look at healthcare error in a new way after reading this book.
4,pump dispensers,This what I use and when I couldn't find the pump dispenser locally I ordered it over the internet. So of course I give it a good review.
4,It's great!,This toothpaste was great. It's easy to use and no mess. I used it every 3 times a day. The smell was good and I like it. I recommanded for everyone.
2,Doesn't keep teeth white,I've been using 3 bottles of this stuff (half a year) and today I went to a dentist appointment and he asked me if I smoked because how stained my teeth were and I never smoke. Afterwards he proceeded to *bleep* my teeth and gums. Bottom line: doesn't whiten teeth.
5,Aquafresh Pump Toothpaste,"I love the pump style of Aquafresh. I hope they don't plan to discontinue the ""pump"". I am having a harder time finding it in stores. Now I have to make my toothpaste ""pump"" purchases on-line. It's no big deal, but if the ""pump"" style is discontinued, it's going get really hard to purchase it, even via the internet. Keep The Pump Alive!!!!"
4,Pricey,This model is convenient but pricey when compared to regular tooth paste tubes. Other than price no complaints. Previous models used to stuck after 3/4th use. But these ones are so good so far
4,I like this toothpaste,"Ok I have tried a lot of different toothpastes out there from the regular, to this fancy one to hippy products. I like this product its good. Is it the best I've tried? No...Aquafresh is still my favorite overall toothpaste manufacturer but this one does not leave my mouth as fresh feeling as some of their other products which is the only reason I docked a star. For the price is should be everybit as good if not better.Try some of their other products in the tube and compare- this product is good but they make better!"
3,Amazing Animals Crocodile,"Bought this Crocodile recently to add to my sons animal train animals. Animal squeaks when you close it's mouth, pretty cute. The tail and legs click when you rotate them. Out of the animals available, I would say this one is one of the more played with options."
3,The Pictures are OK,"I read the book without interruption!Easy to go throught, and plenty of information about the Sadhus. But the writer was a little bit unemotional in his way. very god pictures."
3,There's not a lot of content on this disc.,"I watched and followed along, it is all very good technique and that is very important, but I felt there was not enough content and i had to just put each chapter on replay until i felt i've gotten it right for each one. Then again, it's not a training program, so I guess it's my fault I bought something thinking it was something else."
2,Overpriced,"I rarely writer reviews, but I was dissappointed with this product. It isn't defective, and it is very professionally done, but it is REALLY FREAKING SHORT!!!!! I memorized 95% of this dvd in less than 15 minutes. No more than 6-7 swings are taught. Also, this is strictly beginner fare. I would expect this sort of thing to be a free promo on a website it is so short. This should have been priced at under $10. I like learning various martial arts via DVD, and the material presented on this DVD is just sad. I'm sorry, and I don't mean to be rude, but I would not recommend buying this. Maybe if all 3 volumes were put onto one DVD the price might be justified."
5,Nsync Making the tour video,This is a must have for any Nsync fan. I watch mine over and over and over it has line through the video I watch it so much. It shows bacstage information and is basicly an add on the MTV making the tour show. I really like it check it out!
5,"i don't know, i can't think of a title...","hmmm... i haven't bought it yet... i'm guessing this is the same as the MTV special ""making the tour"" correct? well anyway... i loved it, although i do already have it taped off of tv... but this thing is soo funny and it's so adorable... anyone who hasn't seen it NEEDS to buy it..."
5,Gotta Get It-great video,"Making the Tour is a great video. It was well worth the wait. It tells all about how the guys made their No Strings Attached tour a success. The video shows them rehearsing, getting the stage together, and preparing for the first show. The three full music videos for It's Gonna Be Me, Bye bye bye, and This I Promise you will convince you to buy the video if you haven't seen them already. I recommend this video for anyone who is a fan of *NSYNC or anyone who has an interest in how tours are ""put together."" Buy this video!!!"
5,A great book about raising capital,"Most nonprofit organizations, businesses, and projects rely on raising capital to keep their operations going. In fact, life itself is often a series of asks. Laura Fredricks has written the definitive guide to asking. The book will prove most useful to nonprofit groups, but people in business will also receive great benefits from reading this book and learning the techniques in it since it contains important information on scenarios like asking for a raise or seeking venture funding.I read the first edition of ""The Ask"" a couple of years ago, and the new revised and updated version is even better. There are tons of details on methods for understanding and cultivating the prospects you are asking for money, time, etc. There are also formulas and strategies that have been tested by the author and have a very high rate of success at raising funds.I highly recommend this book."
3,Okay book,"I had to buy this for a fundraising class. It is a little less boring than most how-to books since it is written somewhat conversationally.Recommended for anyone who wants to raise a LOT of money. If you are just raising a little money, I wouldn't bother as the book is rather long and tends to stretch out the topics for too long."
5,BUY THIS CD!!!!,"I would classify this as a ""Desert Island Disc"". TWIG hails from Tempe, AZ. Can't quite put a handle on who they sound like (but influences of Benatar, Stefani, Rush and Nile Rogers are evident) -- a female lead singer with a soulful voice (the girl CAN sing) backed by a great guitar, bass (exceptional player) and drums. TWIG can bust out a sweet, soulful ballad or a rockin' jam and do it in their own unique style.The sound and production is THE BEST I have heard from a local/self-produced album.By this CD and keep and ear out for TWIG in the future."
5,Great live performance,"This DVD really captures the best of a ""staged"" live performance. The audience is (relatively) small and the musicians appear really relaxed. The performance is excellent. I recommend this whole-heartedly."
3,"Great artist, terrible production","Neal Finn is great. This DVD isn't. Take away the very poorly produced, directed and edited video production and you have a nice live CD. Look to 7 Worlds Collide for a spectacular 5 star concert DVD. The three stars are for Neil Finn. Zero of them are for the DVD itself."
3,Fantastic Show BUT.....,"What an entertainer Mr Finn is. from the Enz, to the Crowdies & beyond. I am a huge collector of his work, BUT I am also a collector of DVD's & am very picky about my disks. Why should we just settle for a movie when you can get the same thing on a video tape??? I mean you get the better quality, but please... With all the things DVD players can do we expect so much more. Unfortunately this DVD does not deliver in the Extras front AT ALL. What extras are there you ask?? Well an incomplete discography & an out of date & incorrect biography (well I guess it was going to go out of date sometime) ;-) The concert itself is brilliant as is the video & audio quality, but would it have killed them to get the license for some CH or Enz video clips?? Or even a Neil Finn interview would have done me, with some behind the scenes footage. A great show, but not a great DVD. Sorry"
4,intimate and . . .,"Quality intimate 'unplugged' concert from Neils 'Try Whistling This' tour. Some great moments. A lot of instrument swapping between the band. Great to watch Neils son do a sterling job on the guitar, awkward adolescent presence and all. I agree with another reviewers comment about Neils down to earth presence butmy main criticism is the somewhat strained repoire with the audience, who are so annoyingly quiet. He seems a little unrelaxed compared to what I know of him in live concerts with Crowded House. This a good DVD for fans of Neils solo work to have but I would thoroughly recommend however the 'Seven Worlds Collide' DVD -an inspiring concert covering Neils 'One Nil' album and beyond."
3,Summers with the Bears: six seasons in the north woods,"It was easy reading, was OK, but not what I expected, didn't like how it ended. Book itself, delivery was quick and sent in good condition."
5,A wonderful book about what black bears are truly like.,"This is a book written with honesty and modesty. Just when you think you know what you're talking about where bears are concerned, they prove you wrong...over and over again. I have been involved in black bear research in Minnesota for over 11 years. It made me laugh out loud and cry. It brought back memories and experiences that I thought very few people would understand. You are are two people who do understand. To this day, I have your photo of ""conversation with a bear"" from the Herald on my desk next to some of my own favorite bear photos. Everyday it makes me smile. Thank you Jack and Patty for this wonderful book. I will cherish it."
3,short and sweet,"Summer With The Bears is about a couple who decide to leave the city for an adventure in Minnesota to observe the bears. At first Jack & Patti started out just observing the bears for hours to learn their habits and earn their confidence. And they do earn their trust. There were many more animals that they befriended. They kept a journal on everything that happened concerning the bears and other animals. They even named the bears.As a true animal lover, I really liked this book. The pictures added to the book. If you are looking for a short and sweet read this is the book for you."
3,Pretty Good In A 1970s Guy Kinda Way,"This book was interesting in that it was unusual. The female characters were very unsympathetic and dull, but there are many amusing and deep moments if you don't mind channeling your entire experience through guys."
4,Why Isn't This Back In Print???,"I stupidly put my copy in an over-enthusiastic yard sale 10 years ago, and now wish I hadn't. This exciting and original book (and, yes, funny!!) is about as strange a story as I've ever read. Sort of a twist on ""2001,"" the computer in this sci-fi/humor/fantasy/thriller goes a step farther than HAL! Terrific book, hope I can find it again..."
5,Mind bending psycho babble with loads of wit to boot!,"As in ""Paradise Lost"", a sympathetic look at history's most famous nemesis, Satan.Satan is witty, sly, and brilliant, rather LIKABLE, as he looks upon the life of poor Dr. J. Kassler, whose life has, literally, gone to hell, and who can do no better than to round off his career than by ""counselling"" Satan on HIS hardships.There isn't a single character you'll forget after putting the book down, for those that cross Kassler's path are wrapped in a destiny that can only lead them to the most bizarre of circumstances. Kassler himself seems to set, costume and design the entire production of his life, without forseeing his finale.Possibly one of the funniest, most original books you'll ever pick up ""just for kicks"". Trust me, you'll never look at your own problems the same way again."
5,Great!,Very good jazzy vibe! This CD is full of up beat cuts. Sounds often like St-Germain with more dance beat to it.
3,Not Much ASL,"This is a good video for Blues Clues fans. However, it is billed as having ASL content, which I actually found to be minimal."
2,Expected More Signing,"My daughter is deaf and loves watching blue's clue, so I was some what disappointed with the limited signing. There was a small protion of consistent signing during story time, but that was a small segment.I was expecting signing throughout the entire tape."
4,All Kinds of Signs,I really liked this Video when I received it. The Case was in pretty good shape and video was in excellent viewing Condition! My nephew really enjoys this video. He always likes to pull it out of the shelf and say he wants to watch the Sign Movie! I am glad that he likes it so much!
3,Enjoyable read,"This was an easy reading mystery. I've read KK Beck's Iris Cooper mysteries which I enjoyed a little more than this one but still, I would recommend Body In A Volvo to anyone who wanted a light hearted, quick, mystery. Thank you KK Beck!"
4,Dreaming My Dreams,"The main title is daunting and the rest of the album, which is slanted more to the country and western style, is well worth having.After listening to the very good ""Very Best"" album, you can notice a hoarseness in the voice like a smokers voice and there is quite a decline in her overall performance as if the higher notes were a strain.The accompaniment and songs are good and overall, I like it."
2,An Introduction to Magda Tagliaferro's Life and Work.,"I've bought this DVD in hope to see Magda Tagliaferro's footage at the piano and to watch a full comprehensive documentary, which would cover her whole life. The documentary is ridiculously short (only forty-six minutes in duration!)All you can find on this DVD is the memoirs of Ms. Tagliaferro's friends and students (with their playing- the question is why director Norma Bengell put it into the film instead of the actual footage of the great pianist?)The good thing about this documentary that it's the only one made so far. The bad thing is that there is very little footage of Tagliaferro herself, most of the documentary is filled with talking about her instead of displaying the archival footage of the great Brasilian pianist.Overall, the documentary is shot as an educational film rather than a biographic documentary, which Tagliaferro certainly deserves."
5,DVD Release!,"Does anyone know if there is a dvd release planned on this movie in NTSC, All region or region 1? I would like to see this movie again!"
1,Self-analysis run amok,"To read the summary of the plot is to expect a tale about a family murder. To read this book is to find a self-indulgent autobiography, typical of those who believe their every thought is fascinating. Ms. Bernstein did have a tragedy in her life and there are moments when we are caught up in the relationship she lost with the death of her sister. But these are few compared to the endless display of her life events--over miles and years. I, for one, didn't find her life interesting enough to warrant this much type."
2,The character development is poor,I wish the author could give us a more complete picture than the one that developed in my own mind.
5,Wow!,"Excellent recording, excellent compositions, flow, energy, feeling, musicality, etc etc...This IS a GREAT album."
1,"didnt work, ill tell you why...","We were really excited about this product, but guess what... your water pressure isn't enough to spin the brush. my wife said"" is that it, thats all its gonna spin?"" i was like ""yea"". are you kidding me? very poor performance of this product. we wanted this thing to really spinand clean the car but it was soo weak it is terrible"
2,Not strong enough,"The plastic breaks on it, for the soap and the handle. With little use, or flexibility the plastic is brittle and it broke quickly on me, and then the whole thing becomes useless. When it did work, it did and O.K. job."
5,Beautiful Collection of Photographs,This book showcases the beauty of New York in sepia-toned photographs.
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed, it could have been funnier but the story was a touch weak, the jokes a bit worn."
1,Just terrible,"I can't begin to count the ways this movie went wrong. The two that get me the most are the poor writing and the tentacle violation.This was more disturbing than funny. Even as a big fan of Futurama, I can't recommend this entry to anyone."
2,The Beast with a Billion Bores,"Another huge Futurama fan disappointed. The story was ok, but the jokes were terrible. It hurts me to say that! Even Colleen's t-shirt didn't strike a cord with me (even though it was a geek joke which is something Futurama used to excel at). I get the feeling the writers are avoiding Fry and Leela's relationship, when I think they should go for it. Show their relationship developing, don't try to pretend like the 4th season and last movie didn't happen! I also feel like the writers are placing too much emphasis on Bender (two of the movies are even named after him). Yes, Bender can be funny, but his character needs to be toned down.Futurama has lost its touch. I don't know if it's the length that's throwing it off or the writers have watched too much (new) Simpsons and Family Guy, but it just isn't fun anymore. :'-("
5,"Great Movie, PLUS Best DVD Bonus Item Ever","Having seen an advance copy, unlike some of the other non-reviewers, I can say that the movie is excellent. But I mainly want to point out that the bonus features include the ""lost Futurama episode"", a full-length 30-minute CGI episode originally produced for the old Futurama video game (never aired on TV, but featuring the actual voice cast and written by the show's original writers). This is also very entertaining, and is undoubtedly the best DVD bonus item in Futurama history. What's with the one-star reviews from people who haven't seen the DVD?"
2,Disappointing...,"As a hardcore Futurama fan who has watched every episode many many times over, I was disappointed with the second straight-to-DVD movie. I hadn't been crazy about the first movie, and so my expectations were already pretty low. While there were a few laugh-out-loud jokes, the plot came out of left field and dragged on for far too long.As a big fan of David Cross, I was also disappointed with how unfunny his part in the movie was.I think the writers and creators are trying to do too much and go too big with the feature-length format. I would have been much happier if they would have just stuck to simple, funny plots that lend to some really solid jokes. A better strategy might have been to write four good episodes and transition them together somehow. It would be less like a movie and more like watching four episodes in a row, but it would hopefully be more like the Futurama the fans love.Bottom line: If you're a big fan, it's worth a rent, but not the purchase."
2,"bad movie, rental only","I'm a huge Futurama fan, however this movie was pitiful............... I must say this is by far is a rental then a buy............. I'm still looking forward to the next two movies best a revival of the show with die if the next two are like this movie..................I hope the next two are as good if not better then Bender's Big Score................"
2,This better not suck,"Let's set this straight....Bender's Big Score sucked compared to the any other episode put out thus far. If you say otherwise you're a commie. Seriously though, it i fell asleep 5 times trying to finish it. I'm just that if they had that long to work on it, it could have been funnier than that."
4,Hilarious Trip of Perversion,"I found this movie to be great. It reminds me most of ""Amazon Women in the Mood"", it's not deep or thoughtful, but hilarious. I'd say ""good ol' fashioned humor"", but that doesn't really go with a movie that features a monstrous alien basically having sex with the universe. If I were to attach a ""good ol'"" phrase to this movie, it'd be ""good ol' perverted humor"".I would've given it Five Stars had a certain relationship I really liked not come to a possible end. I won't spoil it, but if you watch the movie, you'll know what I mean."
1,"Oh god, this was bad...","Sigh... Love Futurama, hate this movie...It just isn't funny and the writing is awful. I was so, so, so bored. The last movie was so-so. This one just stinks. For whatever reason the change from a 22 minute episode to a full length feature has proven to be an impossible task for the writers.Bad, bad, bad, BAD!!!! I would have never thought I'd say it, but sadly the abrupt end of the series on a high note was a better end to Futurama than the garbage they've turned out in the direct to DVD features. The really sad part is they are obviously trying, it is just apparently beyond their talents...Again, sigh...."
1,Futurama: Beast with a Billion Backs,"I love this movie, but there is a big scratch shortly after the credits. You have to skip the scene and then backtrack to just after the scratch to watch. Lame."
1,Falls more than a little short of the mark!,"I liked the first Futurama movie, but this was just boring. There wasn't more the a couple of points that I laughed."
2,Fair enough,"This was leaked on the net a while ago and I had a chance to see it.Only for the most die hard of futurma fans, becuse as a stand alone, it is just so absolutely terrible.One long tentical rape joke about the book of revelations."
2,Futurama: The Beast I Should Not Have Purchased,"Futurama: The Beast with a Billion BacksA disappointing DVD. Not up to the standard set by Bender's Big Score or the TV series. A few good lines, but weak & sappy plot. Bought for my daughter--two weeks later it's on TV. Even the October stock market would have been a better place to put the money I spent on this DVD."
2,"Eh, It was ok","Have you ever watched a movie and fallen asleep during it and not cared...Or after a movie that you just watched you feel eh, ok, but nothing really sticks with you. After Bender's Big Score I was hoping to be awed with a tight story, Bender's usual hijinks, Fry's longing for Leela, and Zoidburgs classic quotables...Instead, I feel cheated, it seemed like whoever wrote this movie had never seen a Futurama episode before, never mind even written one. I really am hoping that the next movie is better, because I really want Futurama to go out with a bang."
2,Disappointing,"Like many other reviewers, I too was disappointed with this release. The subplots were not supportive of the main idea. Also, the main plot itself seemed cut and pasted like a bad ransom note. The voice and animation were great, but not enough to keep my review up."
1,Terrible let down,"This one is a big epic fail. I was really looking forward to the type of zingy and dry humor that is characteristic of Futurama. Instead, it felt like I was watching a poor cross of Family Guy with Freak Show (David Cross voicing as Yivo didnt help). The plot makes no sense and humor is very forced. The initial start up is tolerable but as the film advances, it becomes painful to see all the hilarious characters being wasted aimlessly. Not even worth renting."
3,"Not bad, but nonetheless disappointing","While this movie would have made an OK episode (with a lot of editing), it is disappointing primarily because it adds nothing to the over-arching Futurama storyline. By now everyone KNOWS that Fry and Leela are fated to end up together, but the producers seem determined to milk the tension indefinitely, as if the only reason the viewers watch Futurama is to see whether Fry and Leela will get together. I have one word of warning for them: Moonlighting. There have been about a half dozen points in the show where the writers could have clicked Fry and Leela together and then just nonchalantly proceeded with them as a couple, the same way they did with Kiff and Amy. Instead it looks like they've decided to either never resolve the relationship or instead make it the culmination of the entire show. I'm not sure which is worse."
4,An OK movie,"Not nearly as good as Benders big score, but it was definately Furuama and it has its moments. Not one of my favorites, but worth watching anyway, give it to a friend when you're done and save them the 20 bucks."
3,So this is heaven? I thought it would be nicer!,"I'm sorry, I really don't like this movie.It is kind of insulting to science fictionand that is really hard to do.""Where there is no sense, there is no sensation."""
4,View and decide for yourself,"If you are a fan of Futurama then this movie is a definite rental, if not buy. While this movie isn't as good as some of the series' best episodes, I'd say it's very good. There are plenty of DVD extras and the DVD is carbon neutral. It's important to note that with the success of these DVD movies, the likelihood of Futurama returning increases. Don't listen to the 1 or 2 star reviews, just watch the movie for yourself."
3,Limp Plotline,"Futurama i a great franchise, but this offering is like a series of poor episodes strung into a pay-the-bills movie."
3,is futurama trying to keep up with the rest TVshows?,"This movie makes you feel like you are whatching a Family guy/ATHF/Robot Chicken hybrid, the plot is over the top and it doesn't make any sense, the characters lost their personality (except for Bender), also you can hear the difference in the voice acting between the episodes and this movie.they tried to put as many characters from the TVshow as possible in this movie and in return, the main characters don't interact with eachother long enough. It does have some really funny jokes but not many,"
2,Stop Ruining The Futurama Legacy,"Sure, there are a few laughs and some nice bonus things here, but come on....we all know this is a very lazy effort from people who have no excuse to phone it in. Go and watch any single original episode, then watch this...it is so sad to see these highly mediocre titles using the Futurama name. There is some sharp writing and comical stuff here, but it's like the reunion tour of the once great band you loved that just isn't the same. If this/these movies were of different origin/source material, my view might be a little more forgiving. But knowing what all involved are capable of, this leaves me somewhat dumbfounded. And I really wanted to say otherwise!"
3,Not what I expected,"I consider myself a fairly devoted Futurama fan. I've seen pretty much every episode at least 3 times, I have all the DVD's; I even converted every episode into AVI so I can watch it when a DVD player's not available. I have (and will) buy every single DVD ever released, with the hope that the d****ebags at Fox (or someone else) will someday continue the great show, which was killed off entirely too early.Beast With a Billion Backs, however, was a disappointment. Like others noted, the movie takes a fairly large detour from the usual style of Futurama humor, resorting to cheap gags and disgusting jokes (the latter seem like a huge part of this specific film, for some reason). It both reminds me of Family Guy, with its bland and repetitive jokes, and The Simpsons, which, though brilliant in its initial 8 seasons has turned into a mere shadow of its former self.With two other movies planned, I'm really hoping that this is only a temporary bump in the road."
2,What happened?,"I'm still a die-hard Futurama fan, but what happened here? Way too much going on, and the kitchen sink; switching here and there without giving a chance to get into the story, not going far enough or doing well enough with the jokes. Something went wrong. OK, I'll keep it because I'm a die-hard Futurama fan and want everything. More movies please and I'd be quite pleased if the series came back on TV. But, as a die-hard Futurama fan, I have to be honest - something here just wasn't right."
1,Very disappointing,This movie was very disappointing. It lacked the special brand of humor endemic to the Futurama show and is very hard to watch after you are used to seeing the show on TV every day. The plot was pretty lame and some of the characters even seemed out of character.My wife and I are disappointed we didn't rent this instead of buying it.
2,What happened?,"I'm not sure if this is going to be another ""That's Lobstertainment"", which took a few years and several viewings to grow on me, or not.While the animation was top notch, the story, what there was of it, relied too much on gross outs and rehashing. It felt like I was watching a combination of brain slugs and Bender's sour relationship with Planet Express Ship that went on for eons too long.I'll admit, there were funny bits, but there just wasn't enough to keep me interested, especially with Emo!Fry.I should have saved my money."
4,Futurama's Return to Comedy,"This 2nd Futurama movie returns to the comedic roots that made the series great. While the first DVD movie had a great plot and beautiful animation, it was sorely lacking in the humor department. This film isn't quite as pretty to look at, and many reviewers have noted the frequently nonsensical story. What it is, however, is funny. Laugh out loud funny in several spots with clever dialogue and fun sight gags. A perfect Futurama movie would combine the humor of this film and the plot of the last one. Maybe next time. But, until then, fans of Futurama comedy should find this a highly entertaining film."
4,Futurama-rama,"So this is the second of four straight-to-DVD films from the boys at Futurama and they are still producing quality.Overall, I did not enjoy this film as much as the first one, Bender's Big Score. I did not find it nearly as witty, but the storyline was good and fun, and David Cross at Yivo shows that he is still hilarious.The special features are good as well. Unlike Bender's Big Score, there are not quite as many special features, but what they have is good stuff for the watching.I recommend this film to any Futurama fan. If you are a true fan, you will probably buy this no matter what I said anyway, I know that I was getting this DVD no matter what! =)High Points:Yivo, Deathball...Low points:Bender did not have as many wisecracks as normally. I was expecting a bit more bite out of him."
2,disappointed!,"that's all....a very disappointing movie. The plot was all over the place, the animation seemed lacking, it honestly reminded me of a family guy/ aqua teen show.....not in the good way. Futurama was one of the best, creatively ingenious animated shows I've ever watched. And now......wow, that was disappointing"
2,Downhill fast.,"I love Futurama, but I'm not too sure about these movies. Bender's Big Score wasn't as good as the series episodes, but at least it was great to see the old gang back again. This one is just bad. Long and drawn out with no laughs. I hope the last two movies don't continue this downward trend."
2,Hopefully Just a Bump in the Road,"I am a big Futurama fan from the first episode on. I also really enjoyed Bender's Big Score, aside from it running slightly too long.This movie drops the ball multiple levels. There is practically no followup to the plot of BBS, the characters feel really off somehow, and the plot just felt like it dragged on and on.In its defense, however, I will say that the first act started off fairly strong with a lot of laughs; after that, it just felt like the writers had no idea where to go, and the humor, character interaction, and plot just seemed to dry up.You know there's a problem when you start checking the clock to see how much longer the movie is going to run. But, hopefully, this is just a slight misstep in what otherwise is an incredibly fun show."
2,Bender's Low Score,"I've always enjoyed Futurama, and Bender's Big Score was a very funny movie.Unfortunately, The Beast With A Billion Backs totally sucked, and is certainly not worth your time or money. One major issue lies with the storyline. The movie centers around the Planet Express crew, as they do a bunch of weird, random things and eventually meet up with a giant space alien. The story is everywhere and I don't feel like explaining it. Most of the jokes aren't funny ( with a few exceptions)."
2,wish i would have read the reviews first for this before I bought it.,"I have been a Futurama fan for a long time so I just order this thinking it would be good, wrong. Now I was looking at all the one and two star reviews and wish I would have listened to them."
3,It's Futurama...,"I cannot say it is the best of Futurama or that it is better than Bender's Big Score, but I am happy to see new Futurama anytime. I just wish the show would be back on the air sooner rather than later... I hope!"
2,"Love the series, disappointed with movies","I own the DVDs for every season, but even nostalgia can't make these movies good. The writing is much looser, plots are contrived, and the jokes feel forced."
4,Package Fail,"Well, I have been a fan since I was around 14ish, but I wouldn't say I am as big a fan as many of the reviewers here. Overall the movie is enjoyable and funny I think. There is one thing that really bothers me, and its a small thing, but I feel it should be mentioned for future buyers. I bought my copy here at amazon, but the packaging isn't what I expected. Its not like the normal DVD box, instead it is a paper slip, and while I am very pro environment, this is very shoddy packaging. The disk falls out onto the floor when I move the container, no matter how I close it, so it isn't very portable or good in storage. This is a rather minor problem to most, but if I had known, I would not have bought it, so I felt I should mention it."
2,Weaker than Big Score,"Definately a disappointing 2nd direct-to-DVD feature from the Futurama folk. We loved the show, we liked Bender's Big Score but we could barely get through Billion Backs. Very few laugh-out-loud moments, a chuckle or two and a rather strange heaven bent to the whole thing. The Fry subplot was lame. Bender's was probably the best bit. The duel with planetary annihilator cannon, lots of fun.Summary: Rent it, don't own it."
3,"Some funny sight gags, but overall weak","I get the sense that this movie didn't benefit from the same team that wrote the Futurama TV show; it's not as funny and the characters differ from their personalities in the series. The plot involves a creature from another dimension that wants to mate with every sentient being in ours. Some of the visual gags, including the opening credit sequence, were original and funny. The movie ran out of steam, though, about 2/3 of the way through. The jokes weren't funny enough or numerous enough to support the plot, and the writers played fast and loose with the characters and their relationships. The final ""punchline"" is obvious about fifteen minutes into the movie."
1,A huge disappointment,"A waste of time. Not very funny, unimaginative, boring. It seems like the Futurama team is out of ideas."
3,"Good story line, not that funny","As a fan of Futurama I have to say this movie really was a huge let down. After seeing ""Bender's Big Score"" I was hoping that the movies would get better with time. Boy was I wrong, the movie had a pretty good story line, but there wasen't enough funny parts, I didn't find myself laughing not even once. If you plan on getting all the movies for your collection then I recommend buying this that is really the only reason I'd buy this myself, just for the set. I HOPE the third movie is alot better."
5,Futurama DVD,"Great product, was received before it had been released here, my daughters were very impressed with it."
1,Horrible at best,"This outing from the Futurama crew was by far the 'worst episode ever' (thank you Comic Book Guy). The beginning has such promise: interspecies marriage! unexplained phenomena in the sky! Bender getting electrocuted! And then it all goes horribly, horribly wrong. In truth, I can't begin to explain why it's so terrible, since I'm sure many people reading the review will want to buy this movie anyway and I'd certainly hate to ruin the big 'surprise'...however unless you are super keen on seeing all your favorite characters turn into some convoluted chick-flick, sappy version of themselves STAY AWAY from this movie. NOT FUNNY!!!"
2,not really worth downloading,"i've been a futurama fan ever since fry went to the cryogenic freezing lab back in 1999 and i've treasured every single episode of their (i think) short-lived four seasons. when bender's big score came out, i woulda given it 4 stars, but that was mainly b/c i couldn't believe futurama came back. after watching beast with a billion backs, i don't think i laughed more than two or three times. it's just one dumb joke after another. just to make sure i didn't lose this sense of humor, i went back and watched other episodes from the seasons and loved them just the same. my advice it don't waste your time and get them futurama back into seasons, not movies"
5,Harrowing History Overcome,"Hannah Podob has told in admirably clear and unaffected prose her childhood and family history as a survivor of the Holocaust and its impact upon her, her family and the people she knew. Without sentimentality, she recalls her parents and the difficulties they overcame to be together. The rise of the Nazis provides a sinister shadow to her childhood and, like most Jewish people, Hannah and her family try to escape from their home in Warsaw before they are imprisoned or worse.At the centre of the story are the years she and her parents spent crouched in a tiny, improvised lean-to provided by a kindly Polish farmer. It is not a spectacular story but it is a very human one and it deserves to be added to the body of literature remebering those events. It is also inspirational as to what people can achieve with persistence, love and luck.I originally reviewed this book for bookpleasures.com and I am happy to provide a further testament here."
3,"nice scent, poor bottle design","the scent is fine and the look of the bottle is unique, but it is impossible to get the cap off of the bottle!"
4,Fun background music,"The late Tito Puente created a huge catalog of music in his time, to be the King of the Mambo. This album is a great Tito sampler. The music is just fun with infectious beats to get your toes tapping. This album is wonderful for just putting on the stereo, having a cocktail and just chilling out. If you are a fan of Salsa music but may not be overly familiar with specifics, this may be a great introduction to you. The only problem is the lack of liner notes (a problem with the entire series), but you get what you pay for. Worth the money."
5,"""Lovely"" book about Audrey Hepburn",This book is a perfect gift for my friend who is an Audrey Hepburn fan. It contains photos and stories that captures the star perfectly and I can't wait to wrap it up!
5,Wonderful for everyone to read!,"I am so glad I bought this little coffee-table type book! I am definately an Audrey fan, but my sister (who isn't) really enjoyed the book as well. I have it displayed on my bookshelf and people are always leafing through it when they come over. You won't be sorry you bought this one!"
2,"Should be titled ""The Incomplete Piano Works""","""Piano Works"" would lead you to believe that 1) whole works are represented, not selections thereof and 2) that every whole work composed is included. Neither would be true of this set. Bizarrely enough they manage to inlcude 23 out of 24 preludes [?] and 5 of the 6 etudes from book 2 and nothing from book one of the etudes. I'm sure there is a reason but as it is this is deceptively mis-titled.Having purchased this boxed ""Piano Works,"" I find I will have to retrace my steps and also buy Debussy's ""piano works"" amounting to three cds worth.The playing is good. I'm assuming all the notes were struck but given the omissions already noted maybe not."
5,littlebear-little sherlock bear,"my grandson who is 2 1/2 just loves little bear, we haven't seen one yet that isn't a hit. i like the little bear series because they are so positive, no anger, ugly words like hate or stupid. i recommend them to all my friends with young children!"
2,30 bucks for this?,"let's see the one positive--some nice dive footage.now, all the negatives--only 35 min. for $30; excessively long intro and credits, crap music, poor video formatting (rightmost titles frequently chopped). only the most cursory info on the dives or conditions in general. did i mention the crappy music? steel drum versions of ""we are the world"" (almost the entire song, for an above-water tour of the 3 islands) and ""america the beautiful"" during the closing scenes and credits. weak numbers during the all-too-short dive segments. ah, plus the numerous typos and poor style on the back cover text.would seriously consider just donating my copy to the library's friends' sale but i wouldn't want to subject anyone else to this lame production. will not buy another gary knapp dive travel dvd."
4,Inspiring Groundwork,"With ""Modernity at Large"" Appadurai created a widely acknowledged groundwork for a viable perspective on globalization. This little book is a very thorough description about what is going on and changing in the world around us. Additionally, it provides numerous details and examples from all over the world - each of which could be developed even further. It should be read by everyone, who is afraid globalization is erasing the cultural diversity of this world."
1,A waste of time,"Obtuse and without meaning in the real world. Appaduarai needs to set foot on real soil and realize the world is not created, nor can it be defined behind ivy walls.Use your time to read something of importance and let Appadurai die on the vine, he may impress other sycophantic scholars with his labeling and vocabulary but you don't need him."
3,Good for its time,"I want to admit up front that I am a child of my times--I found the 1992 version of this movie to be far superior to this one. To me, this movie had a contrived feel to it--Hawkeye actually wears a coonskin cap ala Daniel Boone; the Indians grunt a lot; the acting is overdramatic as many of the older films are; the music is grating on the nerves. The war scenes are realistic, however, and the familiar antagonism between Duncan and Hawkeye is still palpable.I have to remind myself that this film was made nearly 80 years ago and was no doubt a landmark film for that era. I am just glad I live in this era of film making. It was a good film to watch once or twice, but not over and over as I have the modern version."
3,COLONIAL FRONTIER,WITHOUT A DOUBT HAS A PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN WESTERN FILMS AND A PARTICULAR INTEREST FOR RANDOLPH SCOTT'S YOUTHFUL PORTRAYAL OF NATTY BUMPO(HAWKEYE). MICHAEL MANN'S VERSION CONVEYS A MORE CREDIBLE ADAPTATION FOR TODAYS AUDIENCE.
1,Arrived broken,"Three out of my four deflectors arrived cracked, just as the other reviewer mentioned. This should say something about the product and its structural integrity. Either Weathertech needs to build a better product or Amazon needs to package this product better."
2,Broken,This item that was ordered as a new product came broken. Both front deflectors had pieces of plastic broken off and both of them had visible scratches everywhere.
4,"a bit dated, but a nice historical romance","The story is set in the area around Hesse during the Thirty Years' War. The characters are interesting, and the book has some military action, but the story can be a bit maudlin at times. Several of the characters are not fully developed, but overall it is a good read. Be warned, however, that the ending seems a bit like a hastily-written add-on, though for the time period in which this book was written, it may not have appeared so."
4,Great Product for the Money,"While they may not be the nicest shoe trees carried by amazon, they are certainly the best deal out there. The cedar foot inserts and spring loaded handle make them a perfect addition to my baseball umpire equipment bag. Since they are not 100% cedar like some other on the market they way less which can be important when one already has to travel with a lot of weight. I ordered 4 sets and they are going to go in all my umpire shoes to help them maintain shape and keep the stink and dampness out. They will be perfect for my purposes."
2,Disappointed,"The sound quality on this radio is very poor. The clock is not displayed when the radio is on! This makes listening to the radio and getting ready for work incompatible. The timer can only be set in increments of 10 minutes up to 90 minutes. It is also unattractive. It doesn't fit flush under the counter, it hangs by odd looking prongs."
4,The Book That Couldn't Be Put Down........,"I carried this book everywhere, for years. It went into my pocket, coming out, when I needed it.The pages became worn, and dirty, but it didn't mater.I've accidentally dropped it in water. The inks didn't bleed, and the pages weren't crinkly. Nearly ten years later, and it has held up, now sitting pretty in an album.The info inside is off, being unofficial.This is a must for all Justin's Fan Base!"
1,NOT Squirrel proof!!,"This expensive Cage feeder, was advertised on Amazon as ""squrrel proof""-it is not!! Duncraft said that they had had many complaints about the design of this feeder and had redesigned the lid, which a squrrel can pry open. Duncraft stated that Amazon.com was selling an old model of the feeder that used the defective design. So who is at fault: Duncraft or Amazon?? Duncraft should never sell a feeder that has known defects and Amazon should never offer merchandise with false claims. Althouth that may not have their intent-I am left with a defective product. I had to tie a piece of wire over the lid to keep the squrrels from opening the feeder, but then I was visited by a pair of Raccoons-the battle goes on! Amazon did offer to refund my money, but I had thrown away the box, and am disabled which makes it very difficult for me to get to a post office. I just took the loss!! Very disatisfied with this product!!!!!"
5,Great read,I really enjoyed this book. I thought everything was written very well and I loved the devotion that she created between Allegreto and Elena. I found Allegreto very interesting in the first book and I think this sequal really delivered. He was a complicated person that I thought found his match in Elena. It is a keeper for me.
5,"stunning tale, dramatic complex characters","Laura Kinsale's writing skills really shine in Shadow Heart. Her style and tone is impressive and consistent throughout this tale of intrique in 14th-century Europe. Kinsale's sex scenes are dark, perhaps more then some readers feel comfortable with, but it works perfectly for her characters who are complex and nothing short of fascinating. Expect action, adventure, mystery, intrique, passion, and fabulous fabulous storytelling."
2,"personally, not my thing....","Let's think about this... A 17 yr old girl loses her virginity to a rape, and two days later pulls the leather whip out? COME ON! Seriously? I just thought the character's actions didn't match the personality at all... Going back to Dorothy Garlock and Julie Garwood...."
1,MISS,"After reading four of this authors books (2 I loved & 2 I hated) I have decided that Laura Kinsale is a hit or miss author. This book was a definite miss for me. I simply did not like the characters. It was not romantic or loving just a bunch of boring intrigue. No it wasn't the ""rape"" scene that bothered me. As I read I thought "" Why should it? The heroine surely didn't care!"" . Her only response to the supposed rape was to discover that SHE likes to inflict pain. After slugging through this book I decided too just give up. After all I read for PLEASURE!"
5,Laura Kinsale in top form,"Laura Kinsale's novels belong in the category of fiction rather than romance. In 'Shadowheart,' she rises to challenge of updating a complex and unnerving character from 'For My Lady's Heart.' While the book is somewhat violent, the violence is wholly within context, adds to characterization, and isn't gratuitous.I hope that this book and Ms. Kinsale's earlier novels will get the readership that they deserve."
2,Kind of Sick,"I enjoy a tortured hero and a dark romance as much as the next gal, but this was too far beyond that for me. I gave the book two stars because it is so well written, it's not the how, it's the what that got me.I will be brief and say that the sex was disgusting, involving domination, pain, and little romance. Hello, this is a romance novel, I want romantic sex. I don't want to finish the book thinking these are some twisted people who need help...not each other. It was a nasty relationship they had and I just felt it did not belong in a historical romance...more like erotica where the sex is down and dirty and has less focus on the love the two feel for each other. The sex between these two was like reading about feral animals mating...more dangerous than fun."
2,Down with Elena...,"Let me first make it known that I RE-READ Shadow and the Star, Prince of Midnight, Flowers from the Storm, and most especially For My Ladys Heart on a regular basis. And frankly, who didn't fall in love with that beautiful cold assassin Algretto in FMLH?? Like many, my eagerness for the book to be released was overwhelming for Shadowheart. And then, Elena happened. In her I didn't see the true love the soul mate that we had waited for and that he deserved! Instead we ended up with a selfish whiny 'person' that I can't even call a heroine. Elena ruined the book. It certainly couldn't have been the ever so brilliant Kinsale!? As Melanthe would say ""Poor Algretto."""
2,"I tried, oh how I tried..........","I really, really wanted to like this book, but I just could not. The ""pleasure from pain"" is not my thing. That, and the fact that as the story progressed, I never warmed up to Elena.I think I'll just stick with For My Lady's Heart and call it quits."
2,Strange Sex Scenes,"This is the first book I have read by Laura Kinsale, and it will probably be my last. I am more than halfway through the book and I still can't figure out why the heroine loves the hero. So far he has kidnapped her and satisfied her with sadomasochistic sex. I don't see the attraction. Please keep the S & M away from romances, or at least create another category of romance."
5,Powerful and brilliant,"Stories that are psychologically powerful as well a gutsy romance don't come along often enough. This story rang true to the historical intrigue of Italy and is so powerfully writen that it is unforgettable. The intricacy detail of the hero's life, his torturous road to redemption and the amazing growth in character and understanding of the heroine were both worth while journeys. An incredibly rich book, I really enjoyed it and look forward to more. i will re-read it. The two books together, My Lady's heart and Shodowheart are an amazing achievement."
3,Shadow Heart,"I was biased in favor of this book because of how much I loved Allegreto from the first book (For My Lady's Heart). And though I still loved him in this one, I wasn't interested in the plot and the love scenes left something to be desired.I liked both Elena and Allegreto. I think it's the characters that save this story from being a complete loss. Even so, when I read the back jacket and the author mentions that she struggled with this one, I can believe it. The love scenes (with or without drawing blood)lack passion and romance. I found myself cold and unmoved by them. After reading the first one, I put this book down for three weeks without picking it up once.I still love Allegreto and I will keep this as part of my collection, but it will be a long time (if ever) before I put forth the effort to read this one again."
2,Just Plain Boring,"Laura Kinsale is a fantastic novelist, but this one isn't up to her usual standards. Neither of these characters is the slightest bit interesting, nor is the plot they find themselves in. Kinsale didn't even write any passion into those kinky sex scenes that so many other reviewers found controversial. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Just re-read your favorite of her oldies."
5,for $59... it's a deal,sound quality is excellent for $59. i'd still give it 5 stars at 3x the price.
4,The best iPod sound available in such a small footprint,"The OmniVibe has great, room-filling sound and looks good too.What might be the most distinctive feature of this unit is the omnidirectional driver arrangement. It really works well at filling a whole room with sound and giving a great presentation on all sides. The volume potential is very good, and the sound is pretty well balanced. I recommend this unit highly."
4,"LOVE IT! High Quality, Works Great, MINOR FLAW","Does everything it's supposed to. Great quality, good build, compatible with my Old Ipod MINI! Only issue I have with it is that when you unplug it and then plug it back in, the music plays FULL BLAST and is a bit scary. Just make sure you are close by to reduce the volume :PRemote is a bit finicky too, but I dont really use it that much. It's hard to skip songs and instead, it fast forwards it. You need to press FIRMLY on the button and aim it perfectly at the unit.Overall, 8.9 out of 10."
1,broke with little use,"The ipod dock stopped working after just a few uses, so I connected it to the back of the speaker using a cable. That worked for a little while. Now, the power will not come on. Hardly used it and now worthless junk."
5,Great,The case was definitely used but the DVD was in great condition. The insert was also missing in this DVD which I was dissapointed about but the DVD itself is awesome. This is something every Offspring fan should have. It's not very long at all but it portrays their lifestyle's and I love that.
5,The best video for the best band ever !,"For me, ""The Offspring"" is defenitely the best band ever... and i know a lot of people who thinks the same. For us, the best video on earth is definitely this one. Concerts, making of, extreme sports, and offspring fun... Offspring Fans, hurry hup and buy this DVD!"
2,SHORT AND ANNOYING!,"This is not a dvd you can watch over. The first 5 minutes is a replyay of a guy jumping off a pole and it goes over and over. Some of the skateboarding is cool but nothing great. The only cool things are the 2 live tracks from the rain festival which are awsome and the bonus live preformance of kids arnt alright. Staring at the sun live and lapd live are annoying, tiny club venue which is neat but there is heaps of stupid video effects going on distorting nearly all the picture. The dvd is onyl about 30 minutes long not including the cridits. And you get very sick of it quickly.The only funny thing is in meet the crew bonus feature when daneil johns from silverchair makes out with one of the offsprings roadie guys.Anyway dont buy this dvd, it sucks ass apart from about 6 minutes of decent live footlage."
2,PISH!,This is dumb. Everything on this CD is on the Conspircy of One CD. And look at the price. Thats how much the CD costs. So if you have a computer with quality graphics then just buy consircy of one and get all this stuff plus a good album.
2,I DONT THINK SO...!!!,just star for the great quality and star for the new stuf americana very bad quality.. but much better than huck it..
3,Tools,Many good pictures. A subject which is well known is dificult to write about. I do not share all authors opinions. Gardening experience is a way to know useful tools.
3,Mediocre performance and sound for this B minor Mass,"The compensating virtue of this version is it's low cost. However performance is average in my layman's opinion. Sound too is only fair being generally vague and sometimes distant.Many music lovers would conclude that this magnificant work warrants a full, higher quality version of the work."
3,its ok,It was ok but for a Janet Jackson fan there was nothing new in this book. I wouldnt recommend it to other fans
4,The Art of Good Sense,"John Train details stories about how Buffet built his fortune by buying up companies who's value was high, but the stock was low for one reason or another. Buffet leaves nothing to chance. If you are serious about investing, this book will interest you, because it does not just apply to someone who buys entire companies even the small investor can benefit from this."
5,Amazing Shooter!,"This game is not your ordinary Doom engine game, this is the ROTT engine! This game has 16x the amount of features that the Doom engine has! If you pick up the wrong crystal, you will go into shrooms (drunk) mode! You can also go into dog mode and bite your enemies! This game has great gameplay and many special effects!If you're bored out with the Doom engine, go for Rott!"
1,This is not real Karaoke,The disk has a relative unknown singer doing Etta James songs and the backing tracks for each song she sings. It does not contain a video file with the words to the fit the backing track - big big difference. I don't know why Amazon (who I love) advertizes backing tracks as karaoke files. They do the same thing on what they call Karaoke downloads. They are obviously not Karaoke fans.
3,Colon Cleanse,"This works but my doctor said do not take for more than 8 days, then stop. You should be ""cleansed"" by then."
1,Not very comfortable,"Had bought this to lay on the sand inside my tent when i went to the beach this summer. I chose it because it is lightweight but seemed thicker than at least one other item of the same category. I am skinny and need the cushioning but this didn't give enough support. Being skinny and small framed I don't weigh much and if this cannot even offer cushioning for a lightweighted person like me, how much more for a heavier person? But then, a heavier person would have more natural padding which might make this seem soft enough or comfortable enough. I don't know. Perhaps I should read other reviews. Eventually I just stopped using it and just laid on a towel on the sand. Now i feel like i should've just kept my money and spend it on something else, but how would i have known if i hadn't bought this first, right? No offense meant to the makers. Perhaps you would improve on it from reviews like this."
5,Cot mattress fits perfectly,"Since my husband goes on a lot of fishing trips where he camps in a tent, he loves this mattress for his cot, it saves his back from hurting in the morning."
4,Although it has not been used....,Although it has not been used as of yet....it was purchased for my sons birthday....he does alot of salmon fishing in early winter....this seems to be made of a nice thickness....should be helpful with comfort and to keep the chill off
4,made the party!,"This CD was awesome! I had also bought a disco ball, then played some great 70s music and voila'! here is the secret revealed for a great party. All the girls on the dance floor loved following the shadow dancers moves!"
2,"Nearly got it right, but....","I really liked the heft of the watch and the comfort of the monitor strap, but I had too many problems with it to keep this watch. First, the signal reception is mediocre. Of all the monitors I tried this one had the most trouble getting a signal (though when it did, it was spot on). The worst was the watch face printing. I'd had it for 3 weeks and been gentle with it and the black paint inside the etched numbers and letters was half missing showing bare metal underneath. Very shoddy-looking. The altimeter worked fine, but I had little use for the weather indication. It's only supposed to be right up to 6 hours out, and it was right only inrefquently right at all.In all, the watch feels great, was comfortable and nice looking (at first) but the details are lacking. I'd give this a pass and look at some of the Polar models (which is what I got to replace it)."
4,Wheres the ending?,"Like the rest I to would have given this book 5 stars except for one thing. What the hell happened at the end? It completely leaves you hanging, and I've been looking all over for a sequel which evidently doesn't exist. My theory is that the writer had every intent on writing a sequel, but I guess, the book must have done so poorly in the stores that it persuaded her not to do a sequel."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"It is a waste of money. This book did not help us at all. It is not a standard ""Dummies"" book. It is poorly organized and poorly written. After much frustration, we ended up spending more money to buy Microsoft's Step-by-Step to finally learn everything we needed to know about FrontPage. Spend a little more for Step-by-Step and you won't regret it. If you still want to buy this Asha Dornfest's FrontPage for Dummies, please email me because I have a copy I can't use."
2,Mediocre at best...,"I've got to agree with a previous review by Jeff, this is a dull book, with no spark, wit or charm. More importantly, it does a rather poor job of introducing the overall concepts of how the software operates and visually composes the website, before it gets into details. Sure, it's important to let people get their feet wet, but the order in which concepts are presented very much matter. Several times during my read, I didn't understand why something I did in chapter 2 worked until I was well into chapter 7. This is like being thrown into playing a game, but not being told the rules until 2/3 of the way through. I'm a big fan of most Dummies books, but not this one."
1,Stop!!!,"Something has gone wrong. This book is not for dummies. It looks like a Dummy book. It feels like a Dummy book. But it reads like a sleeping pill. Whoa. This once great series has lapsed-- with this title, at least -- into the dull realm of documentation. If you think you're a dummy, and you think that software books are minefields of ugly prounouns, then steer clear of this one. This book lacks any of the charm and enthusiasm that made this series (Dummy Books) great."
4,We love pirates!,"This was a gift for my 4yr old son, but I have just as much fun as he does playing with it. Some pieces are really small and hard to keep track of, but overall, he loves it!"
2,Big fan of Sandi's but this book is disappointing!,"I am a big fan of Sandi Genovense's work. I have several of her books. I was excited to learn this book was coming out this year and looking forward to more great scrapbooking ideas, but the book was not what I expected. Most of her work were taken from her most recent books such as 'Sandi Genovese's Three-Dimensional Scrapbooks: Techniques for Building Texture and Style into Your Pages' and 'Designer Scrapbooks with Sandi Genovese'. There are a few new ideas but they do not seem to be her work. I may be wrong but Sandi Genovense's style is very distinctive and some of the new ideas just do not fit her style. To say the least I was a bit disappointed. In the future I will review the books before purchasing it so I don't have duplicates."
2,One More Step Needs More Depth,"Fourteen-years-old Julian Hall is the narrator of this novella, about a boy trying to come to terms with his divorced parents and his mother's growing relationship with Jean-Paul, a charming man from Quebec. The novella lurches about in an episodic manner without developing any of the scenes with satisfaction. Consequently, the struggles Julian faces -- his blowup with his alcoholic father, the death of his grandfather, his mother's marraige to Jean-Paul -- lack emotional pull. Fitch successfully captures the viewpoint of a 14-year-old boy and creates a likable enough narrator, but this novella feels more like a cliff notes than a fully realized story.Mark Kirby"
1,Diamond in the Rough,The video was evidently recorded in an European format that is not compatible with most US DVD/BLURAY players so I haven't been able to view th movie yet but I have researched the problem & think I may be able to reset my BLURAY player to accept all formats - just haven't gotten around to trying it yet. Would have been good to have a warning on the selling site that the DVD wasn't compatible with US players.
4,The Diamond of Jeru,Diamond of Jeru is a good movie and stayed very close to the story line of the book. Any fan of adventure stories should enjoy this.
4,Based on Louis L'Amour's Along the Mangrove Coast,"This movie is based on Along the Mangrove Coast, a story by Louis L'Amour, who visited many exotic places during his years with the merchant marine. The water scenes at night conjure up the steamy locale, but the best thing that could be said about the daytime jungle locations is that they were apparently at least shot outdoors, but in a warm dry climate with no mangrove tree in sight, much less the watery swamps in which they grow. We've all seen the story done better on screen, in Key Largo and other Humphrey Bogart movies set inthe tropics. Billy Zane is a lot better than the material he has to work with. It's stilla good story and the VHS version is inexpensive so on that basis I'd recommend it. I muchprefer the book. Your imagination will create a far superior experience."
3,Not friendly for every family,"There are many good things about this film. It's exciting, it has Billy Zane and Keith Carradine (for their fans), it was written by an excellent storyteller, it is historically interesting, and I would guess this is a perfect movie for fans of Indiana Jones. I don't disagree with any of the other reviewers' comments which I read before ordering it. The one thing no one mentioned is that the subject matter (headhunters) rendered it graphic and gruesome. We were attracted to the movie because of Louis L'Amour, but it was a different kind of movie than his westerns."
5,Cyndi's DVD rekindles memories from her tour and is stunning,"This DVD does justice to Cyndi'd live performances on the At Last tour. She did run up into the crowd a bit more at her show in Cleeland than on the DVD. Her voice is recaptured beauifully on this recording. Whether or not you saw her on this past tour, the DVD will make you feel like you were there. She converses with an audience like no other musical performer that have encountered."
5,A must have!,I was there for the taping. What a fantastic concert! Cyndi is great live and truly one of the most talented artists in the industry today. You will not be disappointed with this DVD.
3,Mixed bag,"I grew up listening to Cyndi. I still have several of her albums. Every one must evolve and in many ways Cyndi has for the better. There is a major problem with this album however. A few songs that are classics and sung strait forward are executed very well by Cyndi. However others are experimental in nature and distort the original feel with extra warbling and la-di-dah. Of the ones that were not distorted and are classic, you find yourself saying ""now who sings that?"" instead of listening to Cyndi. ""Walk on by"" has someone making raspy sounds on the drum loud enough to make you stop and check for a flat tire.She will challenge and maybe best the original with ""Don't Let Me be misunderstood."" I am proud of the fact she can sing in English regardless if it has a French title. And there is a pamphlet with the explanation of her strange mix of songs in this album."
5,She's Still Got The Fire,"Her talent just overwhelms me. She makes this world a better place to live in. Who needs those other boring and disposable pop acts. You can have them. They bore me to tears!!! Cyndi has the talent and the courage to do her own thing, without worrying what anyone else thinks. I wouldn't still be sticking by her 20 yrs. later if she sold her soul to pop music ""sellout"" hell. She interacts with her fans, by running into the audience and making them feel like they matter. She sings her a** off and her heart out. She's the only one left in music imo, who has the courage to be exactly who she is. She's completely unpretentious and loaded with unbelievable energy & talent. She's 51 yrs old, looks no more than 28 & in amazing shape. And that voice is like none other. Even if you're not the consumate Lauper fan, there's still no denying her amazing vocal talent. This DVD proves that over and over again..."
5,DVD Concert Is The Real Thing,"When I first saw the concert on HDTV, I knew that somehow someway I had to get it on DVD (hopefully) and guess where I searched for it :) Amazon had it and looking at their inventory of Cyndi Lauper's reminded me of just how great a singer and performer she is - where some artists should be heard and not seen, Ms. Lauper (I wish she was still single:) is at her best performing!!! So I had to get the DVD and while I was shopping on Amazon I also bought 3 of her CDs :)"
5,In Complete Awe...,"I attended this show with some casual fans of Cyndi Lauper's, back in March when it was taped at Town Hall, and the verdict was...""My God, this woman is simply Amazing""...They were in complete awe of her, as I have been for 20 years plus. Her ability to take complete control of the stage and keep an audience mesmerized for the time she was up there performing is not an easy task. But Cyndi Lauper makes it seem effortless. She truly shines throughout the entire concert, and proves that she is one of the greatest vocalists from the 20th century right up to the present day...This will be a MUST HAVE for anyone who wants to be thoroughly moved and entertained..."
5,Cyn RAWKS!,"After watching this dvd, all I could think ofHOW COME THERE AREN'T MORE LIVE CONCERTS OF CYNDI?The only other one is the In Paris vhs (released here in Brazil in DVD but not a great quality) That's a real shame on all the record industry. Hello people wake up! Release more Cyn live!!The highlight for me is her performance of ""If you go away""I was totally speachless - she's truly incredible."
5,You Have To Buy This DVD!,"I'm a big Cyndi Lauper fan and she has never failed to amaze me. I have all her CDs and other collections such as videos, LDs (Cyndi Lauper Live in Paris & Life with Mikey); but this DVD is the ultimate collection for all Cyndi's old & new fans. So what are you waiting for? Go get it now!"
5,Cyndi's best DVD production yet,Cyndi has matured a lot. This musical performance demonstrates better vocal and background instrumentals. Cyndi's CD - Memphis Blues is an equally strong performance. Both are 5 Star *****
4,excellent singer on DVD... at last,"Very good quality of the video, the songs selection is just perfect, and the performance is very sober. I hope one day I could see Cyndi Lauper here in Barcelona, but at least I have now this Dvd, that gives me an excellent idea of how she is on the stage."
3,Not what I was looking for,"This video might be a good introduction to fitness for someone who is very sedentary and has a low back problem. However, in my case I am very active with a low back injury and the contents of this video had nothing to add to my workout routine.The biggest problem with the video for me was the instructor's constant, constant, constant talking. It was distracting and often added nothing to the workout. Further, though the exercise was demonstrated with explicit detail, sometimes as the set repeated the instructor talked so much I lost my place or my count.I was hoping for a video with more body mechanics information and less breathy conversation. The model demonstrating the exercises uses excellent form. I suppose you could do this workout by turning off the sound and just following the demonstrator's lead.I'll be mailing this one to a friend of mine who needs to get moving and quit sitting on her tailbone. This will be a perfect video for her."
3,Nice toy to give kids something to do on the road,We bought two of these for our kids about a year ago. Many of our vacations are road trips and we wanted them to do something rather than have them watching DVDs. They definitely had fun with them at first. The fun factor was there the first few times they spun a shape around and saw a design being created. That lasted almost 30 minutes.Some frustration set in because it can be difficult to keep the latch closed on the box. Also it is awkward getting some of the shapes to spin in such a small area.All in all this is a fun little toy for the price and should be considered as one of those toys left in the car to entertain your child.
2,"Good concept, poor execution",Spin discs slide under circular guide with moderate pressure while drawing. The frustration this caused our 6-year old offset the enjoyment he would have found from playing with this product.
5,The real work: community conservation,"This fascinating video moves around Africa, with a focus on Kenya, showing the problems and successes of community-based conservation. I especially enjoyed seeing James of Il N'gwesi, an endlessly patient, wise, and motivated Maasai who persuaded his community to set aside a large portion of their grazing land for wildlife and who oversees a safari lodge built on that land. I've been there and met James and now understand how the stresses of drought can threaten the best plan. I wish everyone could go to Kenya and see this place and understand how conservation can serve the needs of people who live off the land. This film is next-best and shows the difficulties of promoting tourism-based conservation in other countries as well. Beautiful land and animals, fascinating people, and an important story."
4,Faith based adivce,This book was very useful to me when my children were young.The principles in it are still valid.
1,ringy bongie,"I want to pretend that I am the artist, even though I am not the artist or the artists legall representative.Hey mon, I am de artist and like when I wrote many of of de songs here I felt like my head was real big but light, floating. It was really great and I had a lot of fun. You can hear the african roots cause mon, I spent a lot of time in brooklyn with real africans, well they dress like it anyway. really I think they just had really nice clothes. Any way so I spent a lot of time in brooklyn botanical gardens which is in bedford sty, and like very authentic lots a boom boom boom and little bonk chica boom bankie very rythmic. so like dat was my inspiration for dis cd."
