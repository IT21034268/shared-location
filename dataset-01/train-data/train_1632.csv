5,"Great portable, very happy","For $30, hard to go wrong here. FM is fantastic, very clear.Within 30 minutes of getting this, I was able to pick up the Voice of Russia (one of the more powerful SW broadcasts), Radio Ukraine, China, and at least 2 dozen Spanish stations I don't understand.Shortwave has many limitations, you will have better results at night and during certain times of the year. Clipping a wire to the antenna will also help."
4,Mini300 Handheld Shortwave Radio,"This is a good radio for its size and price. I listen to it while commuting on the ferry between Seattle and Bainbridge Island, not the best environment for receiving FM signals. But, the radio does pull in FM stations clearly. Outside, it actually does pull in numerous shortwave stations as well. Tuning is a bit finicky, and a slight over input to the volume control can potentially destroy one's ear drums. A better dampended volume control and station selection mechanism would be desirable. I'm nonetheless happy with the radio, and feel that it is well worth the price."
3,"Good reception, very cheap feel, some expected features lacking","I'm not a shortwave junkie, so this review may not be of interest to some people. I just wanted a small portable radio for around the house. It is going to be ok for that use, and for $22 (the gray version was cheaper than the others when I bought), it is a pretty good deal.Observations:- It is a digital readout, but there are no features normally found on digital radios: no scan and no preset stations.- I haven't tried many stations yet, but the reception is much better than the other radios I have in the house.- The headphones are pretty poor; they sound fine, but are hard plastic earbuds and won't stay in my ear at all.- There is no way to lock in your station, and the dial is likely to get moved if you are moving around or handling the radio while listening.- The case is made from really cheap plastic, and the whole thing feels a lot more cheap than the reception, sound quality and Grundig name would make you expect."
1,Grundig,"I was using this radio for several months, everything was cool & pretty, outstanding performance. A few weeks ago, I was travelling and left the radio inside the radio cover and the radio is now like a chewing gum, sticky, gummy and ugly! Unable to use!! So, don't waste money."
1,Defective,"The radio would not turn on, despite trying with several new batteries (which are not included). Returned it and bought another one at Frey Electronics store. The replacement works, but switch positions for channels are flimsy. This item could use some improvement!"
1,Grundig - Not What It Used To Be...,An annoying switching system and a too sensitive dial selector combined with poor indoor reception adds up to a mediocre radio at best. Battery hatch is very insecure (pops open all the time). Typical Chinese workmanship. Definitely not your father's Grundig. Recommend buying a good used one from Ebay.
1,disappointing,"(...)1. the sound is terrific. When you play through the earphones, the true stereo sound is something else!2. The sliding factor. Others have written about stations sliding. Where I live is a very powerful FM station that plays talk shows at night, which I enjoy. Unless I hold the radio, the station will slide. It was actually unlistenable!3. the SW picks up quite well, but also had the sliding factor. If you put the radio in a certain spot in the house and stay away from it, you might hold a station. But how realistic is that??What I thought was a great bargain ended up another return...."
2,Grundig Radio mini 300,Reception is not good. Static and a grinding sound when playing a local station. I'm sure not happy with this one.
2,This Metalic Pearl Radio is No Pearl!!,Difficult to tune stations in for the sharpest tone. Awkward to press the various buttons. I would not endorse this as a wise purchase.
4,Great little radio for the price,"I bought this mainly for listening to AM radio while walking or working around the house. I didn't have very high expectations because of the price and the small size but I figured it would be 'just OK'. Boy, was I wrong, this radio works great! I've used plenty for AM, and I've also listened to quite a bit of shortwave with it. Listening to shortwave is actually viable with this radio and not just a novelty.Good Points:-loud speaker (for its size)-great reception for AM/FM and shortwave.-built-in headphone jack-long battery life-alarm and sleep timer-digital displayBad Points:-the tuning wheel is extremely sensitive you have to practice with it-no light-no key lock (to prevent accidental movement)"
3,Grundig Handheld Shortwave Radio,"I have to admit that with the name ""Grundig"" I expected more radio for my buck.But as the old adage states, ""You get what you pay for"" and that seems to be the way to approach this radio.With it's small size one would expect to only get a ""small sound"" and that is exactly what you get. The tuning mechanism is very touchy and it is sometimes seemingly impossible to get the exact frequency tuned in.Although functional, the long retractable antenna could easily get in someones way or possibly damaged.On the flip side, being a small radio it is perfect for those fishing and camping trips, which is what I use it for. It's lightweight and I have to admit I like the ""Cardinal Red"" housing.I purchased one for myself and then a few months later I purchaced another one for my son."
2,Not so good...,"I'll keep this short and to the point. I bought the radio for AM reception. I live in NJ - southern part - and planned on using the radio primarily for Yankee games (880 out of NY). The radio did not get good reception, which is notable because most other radios that i've had in the past have not had any issues. it looks good and its small, but be aware that you may have some reception issues if you are trying to get stations that are out of the area."
1,ALL FORM. NO FUNCTION. Waste of Money!!,"This radio has the sound quality of the one I made in physics class in high school--TREMENDOUS static.Its hypersensitive rotary tuner menas that the slightest bump to the radio causes it to lose the signal. For that matter, it loses the signal for some unexplained reasons as well.Pretty, with nice latex case, but if you want it to FUNCTION, forget it."
2,"bad design, barely shortwave","1) The design of the radio is terrible. The volume and tuning wheels, and the band-selector slider are located on the sides, so putting the radio in your pocket while listening (or not) will probably result in one or more of these things:* you will no longer be in the same band* the tuner will have moved to another part of the dial* the volume will have been raised to ear-splitting levels* the radio may have been turned off (or on).Although the tuning appears to be digital, it is analog and done with a wheel so small it is very difficult to land exactly on a station. Once there, there is no way to lock in.2) Almost no shortwave stations can be located, indoors or out. This may work better in some other locations than Colorado, but I doubt it.In short, it is no more useful than the cheap radio I had been using. It's 4 times as expensive and 4 times as heavy. The clock, alarm, and more elegant appearance do not compensate for the shortcomings."
4,Not a bad little book,"Okay so this book is not stuffed full of meaningful text and as the reviewer from ""Horn Books"" scathingly pointed out it isn't always easy to tell which dinosaur was which from the text provided but in a nutshell, ""Who really cares about such a triviality?"" This is a nice book that is fun to look at and most kids will have a great time with the 3D glasses provided. The book itself is colorful, and combines both 3D imagery with good quality ordinary artwork. My seven-year-old nephew (at the time) loved it, and was more interested in the dinosaurs, (3D and drawn) than the text itself but with my help we tallied up the dinosaurs to the writing, and had great fun in doing so. A nice, fun read that kids of all ages will enjoy. Shame it's still not in print."
1,pretended to be leather but it is plastic !!,pretended to be leather but it is plastic !! much over priced for a simple plastic unit.size is also problematic to find the filler.
4,Ori,"Very Good book, rituals are not of my tradition ( Santeria ) but can be easly applied to one's own tradition, I enjoyed it very much."
4,Inner Peace: The IFA Concept of ORI,This is a very good book for anyone who needs insights to Yoruba religion and IFA to be specific. This book explained the concepts of Orisha worshiping in Yoruba land and their relatedness and relevants as compared to other religions. The author's knowledge of metalphysical science is very obvious.
3,Not so good,"Look the same as photo on website, but the material is coarse...don't like to wear it at all."
4,"big dinosaur, big fun","this is another example of melissa and doug's well-made plush animals ... we have this one and also the t-rex and a few others by this company... again, they are just the right size for kids of all ages: little ones can get their arms around them, and for everyone else, they are a bit poseable and stand up really well -- if you get all three or four in this set, they are great for imaginitive action play, and look great on the bedroom shelf or corner of room when done. I can't say enough about this company... note: these are not super soft plush, but they are fun to 'pet', to hold, to play with, and to keep for many years!"
2,Curious?????,"What on earth is a ""reluctant heterosexual""? From what I know of ancient Greek history, there was no such term as homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual. It is only modern historians who feel the overwhelming need to add labels, and usually the label that best suits their own sexuality. If a ""hero"" is considered heterosexual then their exploits with the opposite sex are essential to their character and to understanding them. Can you imagine a historian recounting the life of Marc Antony or Julius Caesar for that matter without mentioning Cleopatra or a history of Napoleon without Josephine? And yet here we have another historian placing another annoying tag. And one that doesn't make much sense."
4,A Very Unusual Biography of Alexander the Great,This particular book is full of references from ancient greek literature quoted to illustrate various aspects of Alexander the Great's life. It has the most complete bibliography on Alexander and students will find it is a must buy for that feature alone. The author concentrates on the deterioration of Alexander from alcohol and his parallel life with the god of wine Dionysus. Very unusual indeed...
3,no help,I've been using this product on my pet for months now and have not noticed any change in her thyroid issues (mainly loss of hair on tail). I would have thought it would be effective by now... One of the challenges is knowing what dosing is effective.
1,"This video has very little to do with ""Living History"".","If you view this video with the notion that it's about Civil War Living History, you will most probably be very disappointed. It is about the Civil War and does have a small group of Living Historians (Reenactors) in it, but it is mostly just a Civil War CD that plays over 27 minutes of minor battle footage and some civilian footage as well. The lady who sings these songs has a nice voice, but there are no live musical performances, just the music slapped over the video which has no dialogue except for a cheezy voice over that mentions the words Living History in it, probably there so they can justify the misleading title . The best thing about this video is that it was only 27 minutes long. The soundtrack might make a decent Civil War Woman's CD, but it's got no business being sold as a video in this manner."
1,"Looks great, but ripped right away","These tights look great and I get a lot of complements on them. However, they do have a couple drawbacks. The moment I put them on for the first time they ran in two spots. Two! I'm glad the holes were only dime-sized, were hidden by my skirt, and that I had clear nail polish close by. I would have been furious if I couldn't even wear them once. They say ""one size,"" and that size really is the size of the model (0-4?). I'm 5'4"" 130 lbs, and that's about as big a person could get and still wear these. Finally, I don't know how these are printed, but there are white lines down each side of each leg where the paint didn't reach. They remind me of worn out creases.I would only recommend these for someone my size or smaller, and I hope yours won't come with holes."
4,Cute head turner,"These stockings are so awesome.I got them and loved the color and the design, the day i wore them a lot of my friends and family really like them!On a side note the material is weird, but that's about it, all in all great product!"
2,Mediocre,"Not a bad book, but not worth a purchase. The writing is choppy, with no rhythm. The illustrations are clear but unremarkable. The farmer and his dog are disconnected from the rest of the story. We do get a sense of the process of road building, but other kids' books do a better job at that. My 3-yr-old felt the same way I did: it's not bad, but only worth a few reads. Check out ""Road Builders"" by Hennessy instead, or plenty of others."
1,What?,"Who is this h0? Eminem in woman style? LOL You got to be kidding. This rapper wanna be wants to be like the queen of rap in spanish but the CD is pure crap. She shares the mic with more crap like Tego Calderon ( 1 of the morons who brought reggaeton to the states ). My friend told me this was a good rap CD in spanish but is pure rubbish, keep your money or buy something from 2pac."
1,Horrible,"I regret spending 23.00 on these bars. After reading the rave reviews, I thought they must be good. They have a fake cherry/almond flavor, little real almond flavor at all. They leave an unpleasant after taste and have a grainy texture. I do not recommend them."
4,Good protein bar,"I love that I was finally able to find a protein bar that wasn't chocolate flavored!!! I don't understand why people who like chocolate feel the need to have everything they eat be coated by inferior chocolate. I prefer to eat natural sources of protein, but its good to have bars around for times when you can't get any, to store in the car, etc. Anyway, I look high and low for some kind of high protein bar without chocolate, sugar, gluten, etc. This is good, but gives you a feeling in your mouth like you just ate a spoonful of peanut butter, so have water nearby."
4,"Not too sweet, uncoated, very good protein bar","These are up there in terms of taste and DURABILITY - you can leave them in your car, purse, gym bag.... and they will not melt. No coating is a good thing!My only quibble is I'd like whey protein over soy, but hey, these are pretty good and are an easy replacement for my previously loved Balance Bar Fudge Brownie flavor (which uses HFCS - ick!)"
3,Must be good for the body; you can tell by the bland taste,"My nutrition counselor (I do Ironman triathlons) and training friends in San Diego have raved about this product. I tried a berry flavor and it was not too bad, but all they had at Amazon was the almond crunch and peanut butter flavors, so i decided to give them a try. I must say it seemed like the ideal snack - 30 min after I ate it and for a couple hours after. But you could not live on these as the flavor was, to me, very bland. Try the berry if you can get your hands on it, and NEVER eat one without a glass of water nearby!"
2,OK for medicinal purposes perhaps.,"I trusted the ratings (and how can you go wrong with ""almond crunch""?). Without the labeling I'd have no idea what I was eating, but it's neither tasty nor satisfying. Thanks to these bars, I no longer have an aversion to the gluten-free licorice I thought I didn't like. (Water tastes better than ever as well.) These are basically highly sweetened (not a recipe for anyone who's fructose-intolerant) mashed soy (which is at least frowned upon by some gluten-free guides).You may disagree vehemently, but best to try one or two before ordering the quantities that Amazon requires."
2,Very strange texture,"The texture of this bar is very strange -- reminded me of the ""raw"" bars I have tried. Gummy and sticky, lacking in integrity. It tastes pretty good, though, and has even has a bit of crunch. It has less fiber than I would want and more sugar. And I don't think it lasts as long as some other gluten-free bars I've tried. I think I'll stick with SoyJoy, even though I don't like their flavor quite as much. They have good texture and are more filling."
2,Needs a flavor boost,"We bought these bars for our teenage son who has celiac/sprue. Tasty GF sports nutrition is hard to find. These bars have great ingredients. We tried the chocolate brownie and there is just not enough flavor. They have that funny /vitamin taste you find in some sports bars. My daughter tried one and she thinks they taste ""like window cleaner smells."" A total bust for us, nobody will eat them."
2,Protein Bar,"While this is advertized as Almond Crunch, there isn't anything crunchy about it. Just a protein bar without much pizzazz. I wanted something along the granola line. If you want a protein bar that's basically tasteless be my guest."
1,Misleading - Main Ingredient is Soy,"I started lactating the other day and I was like WTF guys aren's suppose to lactate....so I checked every food I was eating and came to realize that the main ingredient of this protein bar is SOY protein. Oh gee, thanks Amazon for not disclosing that and thanks PureFit for not advertising that as well....if Soy was good for you then wouldn't they want you to know there' Soy in there?"
5,Wonderful tasty protein bars!,"My friend's sister, an elite triathlete and marathoner who regularly ends up on the podium for races, recommendedthese bars and I've been a big fan. They are vegan and not too sweet. I love the almond bar, but the peanut butteris pretty good too. They are quite tasty."
4,Pure fit great,"This is my favorite bar I've tried. Great texture, good flavor and they do not melt in the car or gym bag. They make a great breakfast with a bit of almond butter spread on top."
2,Vegan Protein Bar,Purchased two boxes of these protein bars and found them to be excellent. Fast delivery.
5,protein bar,LOVE this protein bar. I eat 1/2 before I go to the gym. Just enough to give me the energy I need for my 2 hour work out. Great snack in the afternoon. Keep in my purse for those times you can't find gluten free food to eat. Order without shipping charge and price is great.
1,Recipe changed! Added SUGAR!!!,THEY CHANGED THE RECIPE!!! Added 6 grams of sugar and now these bars taste artificially sweet. Not sure why they wanted to mess with the recipe but I am on the lookout now for a new nutrition bar. Last thing I want is more sugar (even if it's from brown rice sugar).
5,PureFit Berry Almond Crunch,"I like the bars, they are chewy with a nice flavor. High protein with fiber (always a very good thing) and not overly sweet like so many other bars."
3,"Decent protein bar, but has its flaws","This is a pretty decent gluten-free, dairy-free protein bar, and it is nice that like they say, it doesn't melt. It is a bit chalky though and the amount of sugar is a little high for me to really be able to call it a nutrition bar. I think currently at about $25 for 15 bars it is somewhat overpriced"
5,Yummy,"I love these bars because they taste good and are both vegan and gluten-free. They are sweet, so that makes them addicting at times. But they do keep me full. I highly recommend them, because with all of my research they are the healthiest vegan/GF protein bars with the highest protein content."
5,Excellent product and speedy seller A++++++,"This product is very low sugar, vegan and tastes incredible. The Seller ships fast and the product was perfect and exactly as described"
2,"Gimme a break, guys!","Y'All, this movie is not that good. The script stunk. t was nothing like the original! It wasn't funny and the acting SSTTIINNKKSS! The only similarities was the plot. I don't remember nudes in the original play!The only reason I watched it was because I was in a school play for it!"
3,Eh...,"Can anyone enlighten me as to why it's set in Italy? And while we're questioning things, what is with the bicycles? They have no relevance to the plot... Some of the charcters are portrayed differently than was Shakespeare's design. I will say, however, it was a fun movie, and Puck was an especially believable character, and well done. It's worth watching if it's at a friend's house, or some other time when you get to watch free movies, but I wouldn't buy it if I were you."
3,A Midsummer Night's Dream,"Well, I am writing this as a review for a class at summer camp and I really did not get the whole picture. From my point of view there are 4 main people who are supposed to marry different people than who they really love. They go out in the woods on bikes to run away and find trouble with the faeries. The faeries make both Demitrius and Lisander fall for Helena and the other chic is left without a dude. In the end the faeries fix the mess and the two couples go get married and see a play with another high class couple. There were many more events than that that happened in the movie like the Faerie Queen falling for an actor and finally getting back with the cute one, but overall I think it was not one of the best performances of Shakespeare's plays."
5,michelle pfeiffer and kevin kline were the best,michelle marie pfeiffer and kevin kline were the two reasons to watch this movie. they worked really well together. calistia flockhart seemed like ally mcbeal in shakesphear's time. she was really out of place. it was a truely fun watching kevin kline with those donkey ears on. the movie its self was really beautiful to look at.
5,I loved it!,"Looking at the other reviews surprises me. I am pretty critical, when it comes to literary adaptions, even though Shakespeare was a playwrite. I loved this version. I finally got around to buying and watching it, after having read the play, once more. It is comical, enchanting, magical, creative, and looks like a Merchant Ivory film, with a fantastic cast. Yes, the music is okay, the costumes gorgeous, the settings beautiful and elaborate, acting excellent. The story shines, too. You travel through each characters journey-Helena feeling betrayed, confused, jealous. Hermia full of joy, then anger, frustration. Bottom, literally a fool, laughed at, and probably the only one who was truly touched for life by the magic of the fairies. Puck, humorous, foolish, mistaken, sorry! Watch for his look of ""Oops!"" If you enjoyed films like Much Ado about Nothing, Room with a View, or Emma, you will love this one, too!"
4,Fun... but could be better,"asthetically, the movie was grand. The costumes and locations were beautiful. However, the acting didn't impress me. Tucci was a fine Puck, Pfeiffer a beautiful and regal Titania... but past those two, I was not wholly impressed. Little was done to at ALL express the characters of Demetrius and Lysander, I got no feel for them whatsoever in the movie... their characters did not show through at all. Hermia was wonderful, she played the role fabulously. Calista Flockhart, however, did not do the part of Helena justice. She whined throughout the whole thing, making Helena two dimensional and annoying. (although, I must say I'm rather critical of her because after being Helena in a play of MND myself, I've learned a lot)Many important parts of the script were cut out, which left the play lacking in many important aspects. The direction was fair, at best. I absolutely love the play, therefore I do enjoy the movie, despite some of the mediocre acting."
3,"Good Production, Average Movie","A Midsummer Night's Dream by the great William Shakespear enjoys a reprisal in this lavish American production. The movie's strong points are its rich costumes, beautiful music, and pretty decent acting. However, this is not enough to offset its weak points. These include nearly incomprehensible, and if I may be pardoned for this, phony acents; historical anarchronisms, and the lack of connection between the first part of the movie (the love story) and the second part (the performance of the play at the royal palace). Although the acting is polished, I somehow lacked the feeling of sympathy for the characters: they just did not convince me their emotions were genuine. This movie is neither a classic adaptation of Shakespear, nor a classic in its own right, but is definitely scores points for the magnificence of its production"
1,Poor Will gets ripped off again,"A Midsummer Nightmare; Trashy piece with stars and no substance. No surprise that Kevin Kline (fine actor) panders his talent to the highest bidder. The other ""stars"" should also be embarassed. james a. sullivan"
2,Not what I expected.,"When I ordered this, I expected a DVD not a book. Although it was not what my Granddaughter needed, she did manage to use it in her studies. So all went well anyway. She did get a good grade too."
5,A EXCELENT MIDSUMMER NIGHT`S DREAM!,"I love the film , i can`t explain it i just love it,the actors,their roles,the set the trama everything its the best 100%."
5,Really good piece of work!,"I had to watch this movie in class since we were studying Shakespear, and I thought it would be incredibly boring.Boy was I wrong!This was one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I seriously eccomend it!(It has a few PG-13 parts, definetely, but it's still really good)It's also pretty funny!:)"
4,Beautiful Movie,"Beautiful movie I must proclaim, and those detractors methinks them lame. Played, scored, and filmed top notch, twas a joy for me to watch."
4,A Sumptuous Midsummer's Night,"This recent rendering of the time-honored classic is lavishly luscious and refreshingly amusing. While the first half moves a bit more swiftly than the second, and there is more emphasis than Shakespeare made of Kevin Kline's Bottom, the overall effort is more than satisfying. The language is delivered coherently, the fairies are delightful, and the wandering lovers, lost in the woods are extremely believable in this outing. I was especially delighted with the decision to set the action in Tuscany in the 19th century and to use the bicycle as a comic device. This is a wonderful family viewing opportunity and a gentle way to introduce children to Shakespeare."
2,It could've been so good!,"I went and saw a college performance of a Midsummer Night's Dream and it was the funniest thing I've ever seen. My sister and I were rolling in the aisles, crying we were laughing so hard. And so my love of this play was born. So naturally I was excited when I heard there was a movie version coming out. Saw it in the theater and I don't think I even crack a smile once the whole entire movie. It was pleasant, charming and occasionally good-humored. But this is one of the funniest comedies ever, and not one bit of that comes across in the movie. I was extremely disappointed. Now I just need to find a version of the play that the amateur college group performed so much better than this group of seasoned Hollywood veterans."
2,THIS MOVIE GETS ONE STAR FOR BEAUTIFUL SCENERY AND ONE STAR,"FOR HOW WELL MICHELLE PHEIFFER WEARS GLITTER BELIEVABLY. I really really really wanted to like this movie.....it had everything going for it...big budget....Shakespear.....Great stars (WELL, ""GREAT"" IN EVERYTHING ELSE THEY HAVE DONE ANYWAY) This movie was just, well, long...or maybe it just seemed long. Kevin Klein, who I ADORE in all the odd roles he excels at, was well, just odd... with out the good natured humor. Although I'm quite sure that the writers thought that it was quite amusing. That's the only explaination I can think of for this movie. To be fair...(I'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE A REAL SCHREW NO SHAKESPEAR-IAN PUN INTENDED =) Read other reviews...I know others liked it...but for the life of me I can't figure out why..."
1,A Midsummer NightMear,"I seen this movie last year when it came out in the Theater.""Matrix"" was already showing,so we settled for this film. I love Michelle Pfeiffer,and Kevin Kline has always been one of my favorite actors. When the film started,I knew from the begining this was a mistake. If I had a choice,I'd rather have my Wisdom teeth pulled without novacane.I would have walked out of the film,but I was on a date and didn't want to be rude.The happiest day of my life is when I saw,""The End.""If anyone wants life to slow down,rent this video.Two hours will seem like a week."
4,pretty cool,"Nor a fan of Shakespeare, but i was able to enjoy this movie, helped a lot eith assignment of reading it."
2,"A misbegotten ""Night's Dream""","Can Shakespeare's most magical play stand having all the magic taken out if there are at least pretty people playing the parts? I'm sorry, but no. Some have complained about the mud fights and nudity that pervade the film, which are not really a problem in a convention-defying play such as this, but every major role is so miscast as to make this movie nearly unwatchable.The main culprit is Calista Flockhart, who has to stop McBealing her way through every role she gets. Stanley Tucci does an adequate job of acting but physically is about the last person who should play Puck. Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Everett do a fair job as Titania and Oberon, but as usual it's Kevin Kline who chews up the Tuscan scenery and steals the show with gusto.The worst mistake for a movie about enchantment is to be mediocre and ordinary. You just won't remember this ""Dream"" for very long after it's over."
3,William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,"The reason I bought the movie is because my daughter is auditioning for a part in the Movie. We were disappointed at the quality because it was not full screen. However, we did like the movie just wished the quality was better."
5,A fun filled fantasy adventure!,"This is my favorite Shakespeare play, so I was dying to see it when I heard it was coming out. And I can tell you, this film not only fulfilled my expectations, it exceeded them. This hilarious tale of love gone awry thanks to the mischief of the fairy world is told through splendid visual and musical scenery. Shot in Italy, it really adds a touch of wonder to the already wonderous atmosphere. My favorite is Kevin Kline as Bottom, the actor without a clue, although I do love Christian Bale as the spiteful Demetrius, who has a great change of heart by the end of the film. If you love Shakespeare, or (like me) love Italy, then you definitely want to see this romantic comedy!"
3,Great Late Summer Night Mood Movie,"I know this version gets panned all the time. And I have seen better versions, (the 1935 version with, of all people, Jimmy Cagney as Bottom was amazingly good). But I love to watch this film. If you love Shakespeare comedies when they go into the woods and things go topsy turvy, then this will be a fun DVD to play on a late Summer night when you can't go to sleep."
2,Overproduced and pointless,"Shakespeare's play already contains plenty of time-shifts. Ancient Athens meets fairlyland, which in turn meets Elizabethan tradespeople-turned-thespians...adding layers of 19th century Italy to the mix, and bicycles, and windeup gramophones, and a repetitive recycling of Italian opera's greatest hits on the soundtrack, just muddies things up. Lots of money went into this production, and it does have some nice visuals. But there is no genuine artistic vision here. Less would have been more. The two stars are for the director's concept, not for author William S., whose best lines are just about impossible to ruin."
5,To good for words,"I absolutly loved this movie. I've have seen many other Shakespearian movie/plays before, and this one is definatly on my top ten list. If you like Midsummers Night's Dream then I think you'll love another Shakespeare comedy. Both Much Ado About Nothing (with Kenneth Branagh) and Twelfth Night (with Helen Bonham Carter) are both excellent movies. I recomend these to anyone. Also The movie Hamlet (also with Kenneth Branagh) is a graet movie but beware it is four hours long but well worh it. I hope everyone who reads this will give these other movies a look."
1,Shakespeare at his worst,"Of all the attempts at making Dream work on film, this has got to be the worst ... and with an all star cast to boot, whose performances could be and were outdone by an elementary school production in Upstate New York. To date, Peter Hall has been the only director to accomplish this play on film."
5,Shakespeare for Dummies??,"Ok, so it's not exactly true to Shakespearean theatre, but it's a very fun film! The cast is perfect & really makes A Midsummer Night's Dream a delight. My teenage daughter has been trying to study Shakespeare and finds it difficult reading, but movies like this have helped her to understand the entire storyline, this making reading his work a lot easier. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the change in time periods; That was unnecessary."
5,Great Movie,This was wonderfully made and the actor did Shakespeare justice. I would recommend this movie to all lovers of Shakespeare and lovers in general.
4,A PLAYFUL ROMP!,"One midsummer's night the stars came out! Whether you are a lover of Shakespeare or not this film will definitely catch your fancy.In a playful romp, Kevin Kline (Dave) as Nick Bottom leads a cast including Michelle Pfeiffer (To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday) as Titania, Stanley Tucci (Road To Perdition) as Puck (Robin Goodfellow), Rupert Everett as Oberon, Calista Flockhart (far better than anything she ever did in Ally McBeal) as Helena, Dominic West as Lysander, Christian Bale as Demetrius and Anna Friel as Hermia.Kline is exceptional in his role. In fact you could watch his parts alone and still come away feeling rewarded for having done so.Beautifully set and shot in Tuscany, A Midsummer Night's Dream will become a favorite."
4,Shakespeare Rolling in Grave For Some Choices in Film,"For anyone who has read this play or seen any true performance of this play, there are some shockingly odd things about this movie. The producers' first mistake was updating the play to the 19th century. The work was meant to be played out in ancient Greece and in the fairy world of that time period. The most outlandish use of poetic license was when Puck (actor/director Stanley Tucci) was taking his ride on the bicycle. It seemed very out of place for this mythical creature to be doing this.I do agree with the other reviewers that this movie was excellent eye candy and that even the lesser talented actors shine in this film. Besides, how can you go wrong by glittering up Michelle Pfiffer? Three stars for Shakespeare's words and one more for the excellent performance of the play-within-the-play near the end of the film."
5,Five More Stars,"I echo most of the kind words previously offered to this version, but want to add a few additional observations. First, rather like ""Shakespeare In Love,"" it amply rewards a second viewing, and a third. Also as in the case of ""S.I.L.,"" it was a film that the makers obviously had fun making. Cheers, of course, to Kevin Kline (given an opportunity to combine some serious acting with his patented eye-rolling mania), Calista Flockhart (a sublime comedienne), Stanley Tucci, and many of the minor roles, such as Roger Rees as Quince. The gorgeous Sophie Marceau doesn't have much to do, but just looking at her is ample reward. The production values are exalted, and the insertion of opera vocals by such as Renee Fleming and Cecilia Bartoli delightful...if distracting, I can't resist singing along with them. They even made up one extra as a dead ringer for Giuseppi Verdi, stovepipe hat and all. Pure Shakespeare? Of course not. But an elegant and entertaining variation on his theme, YES."
3,Okay,The episodes were a little slow compared to other Sesame Street Sing Alongs. The Karaoke one was actually a combo of singing with Elmo. Only part of it was karaoke. These were not my two-year-old's favorites of his Sesame Street collection.
4,Pretty Good,"Not bad for a lesser priced cd. Of course this cd does not have a lot of singles. It only has Girls Just Wanna Have Fun and Money Changes Everything. But the others are a nice compilations of songs that she likes and some are not that bad. When You Were Mine is a great song form her debut album that was written by Prince. And other good songs are A Night To Remember, Calm Inside The Storm, and Iko Iko the remake. All together it shows different styles of music. All songs can be found on her albums."
2,MOSTLY WEAK MOMENTS,"Was this album done to fulfill her contract with Sony? Did Cyndi really pick these songs? (If so, was she in the midst of morning sickness at the time?) It contains mostly songs that were fillers from other albums. ""Dancing With a Stranger"" and ""Dear John"" are Cyndi at her worst. The other songs (with the exception of ""Money,"" ""Girls,"" ""When U Were Mine"" and ""Someone Like Me"" -- all gems) are mediocre. Cyndi's newer material is much stronger."
5,psp,"You idiot, its not only for PSPs - the card can go in anything that has a memory stick duo slot [phones + cameras + PSP + TVs + computers]"
5,One of the true great singer/songwriter/guitarists!!!,"If you ever get a chance to see Steve Young perform, DON""T MISS IT!!! This man has been singing and performing world wide for a very long time and is an amazing singer/songwriter/guitarist. A powerhouse who by all rights should be a superstar in the music world instead of a cult figure. Steve has ""been there"" with many of the other greats of music, some who are perhaps better known, from the 1960's through today, and while he may not have gotten the ""breaks"" he deserved in the music business, he has left a lasting impact. Steve stands out as an honest beacon of very bright light in a dark sea of mediocrity. Buy ANY CD or recording of Steve Young's that you can find, and rest assured that you will not be disappointed!!!"
3,good but isnt for all,"well amazon said it would fit my automatic transmission cobalt but it did not, I still give 3 stars because the sift knob was so sweet looking. Sucks that it didn't fit. :("
5,We loved it!,I thought this book was great. I am 8 and read this for school with my mom and sister. Some parts were very sad but I did not want this book to end.
4,Very good!,"A nice and thorough look at Balsamic Vinegar, and the standards for various certifications. Great recipes for aged through traditional balsamic vinegars."
2,OK,This book was OK. It started off good and dragged through the rest of the story. I usually read a book in two days. It took me two weeks. I enjoyed her books on Digger and Brad. I hope Dean and Rosa's books are better than Owen.
3,Not my kind of groove,"This book might be helpful to those people who appreciate some really far out ""music."" Unfortunately, my field of pleasure is classical, blues, rhythm & blues, 70s stuff, Broadway music, jazz, oldies - which really covers a lot of ground - some country, pop, spiritual and hip-hop. From the reviews of the people, it seems there's a reason why the music in ""lost in the grooves"" never made it big time. Over the years, I have heard some albums that I cherished and these never got publicized much, never made it to CD nor were they mentioned in this book. This is the reason for my disappointment. But that's me and why we have ""art."""
2,Lost in Who's Grooves?,"I suppose if you're a typical pop-junkie weened on boy bands and a steady diet of commercial T-40, you may have missed some of the music and musicians in this book. As an avid music fan, I never missed Christina Aguilera (though i wish i had), AC/DC, Tori Amos, Adam & the Ants, America, Paul Anka, the Archies and so many of the other artists mentioned in this book beyond the ""A"" section of the index. I don't necessarily blame the book, for the average American sheep plumping on a steady major label spoon-feeding of aural air biscuits this is probably much more interesting, and the teen dreamer dying to pick up the ""lost"" Aguilera material will be elated. For anyone who's looked beyond, followed and taken an interest in music, this will make a good coaster. Again, not the book's fault, mine for not reading more before I made the purchase."
4,All Men Are Mortal,This is an interesting book. It's a good mix for the existentialist history fan. Simone de Beauvoir did a great job of capturing the moods of the various time periods she wrote about. I'm looking forward to reading some of her other books.
3,A good resource for novice embedded systems projects.,"This book describes how to use your PC's parallel printer port (LPT1:) to interface with embedded systems hardware such as sensors and control circuits. The author starts by showing how to control input and output, and moves on to building and interfacing an 8-channel temperature measurement device (a muxed ADC setup based around the LM335 sensor). The software approach is developed with QBasic or GW-Basic, and includes example code on a floppy which can control and interpret data from any parallel port. With the prevalence of Visual Basic and Win95/WinNT (which DON'T allow direct control of the printer port), the author's approach is a bit dated, but for a beginner, it should suffice. Anyone who wants to learn the basics cheaply and easily would enjoy this book. The book is definitely a good place to start, and more sophisticated readers could then move on to Axelson's ""Parallel Port Complete..."" book, among others."
1,Don't waist your time,"I purchased this book to suppliment a class I teach in Microprocessors. I found some good information, however most of the material is going to be over most peoples heads. It has a large section on building a interface device that you will never use and spends very little time talking about the information most people are buying this book for. It does come with a software disk that makes testing you cable easy, and it does give you information that will help you out, but I would recommend getting the info off the web, and not purchasing this book.It is also very short for the money you will pay."
2,marginally worth it,"This book had outlived its purpose by page 10. At that time you will have already learned what you need to know: The pinout of the LPT1 Port,which pins are inputs and which are outputs, the ports address (888 Decimal), and some mild detail on how to read/write to the port. After that point you will be ready to go, and the rest is really pointless if you know how to program, and you know your harware. If you cant find those things out anywhere else, then buy it (it got me building hardware and writing code)but I suggest looking online first. If you can find this book in a store, just browsing through the first few pages for 5 minutes or so will have you going home and making things work cost free. (this is meant to apply to students)"
3,No Kidding Around,"City kid learns to survive in the wilderness, and turns the tables on kidnappers.Actually, it isn't that bad.It's not that good, but it doesn't pretend to be."
3,Indians in the US,"Karma and Other Stories. Rishi Reddi's debut book with short stories. Rishi was born in the Indian city of Hyderabad and then moved to the US with her parents when she was young. Her first attempt to write a book has been commendable. She is comfortable writing about the Boston area, where she spent most of her life in the US. She talks about the Telugu speaking families settled in the US. And, to an extent she has been able to create the aura. I particularly liked the story 'Lord Krishna' - it was all about standing up for something that's wrong and also about trying to forgive.Though most of the stories are well written, in easy English, and have a logical ending, there are one or two stories that end abruptly & whose ending leave much to the reader's imagination. And there is another story that was a bit confusing - was Rishi trying to tell a story about Devdasis or about Hindu/Muslim divide?"
3,Coud not use...,"This product was just what I am looking for but one that is good to use with the Philips Go Gear I pod. This I POD is not a touch screen I pod so this arm band was not suited for it. Was pleased with the prompt response and fully refunded response to my displease with it. Will shop with Amazon and tell friends of my pleasure with them as well.Thank You,Rebecca T. Strizek"
1,Not as described.,"If you are looking for something that will hold only CD's or only the DVD without the booklet, this may work for you. But with the description it seemed that it would hold the DVD's and booklets like I was looking for. The company is difficult to work with and their return policy has you paying shipping both ways without refund. I would not use them again."
3,Dictionary of Psych,"Somewhat helpful, but not as thorough as I would have hoped. It may become more useful and practical as I advance in my studies."
4,Eye Opening,"I found this book to be so enlightening on the subject of mental illness. We as Christians tend to ignore this problem. Even if you are not a Christian I would still recommend this book. It's not a ""religious"" book. It really puts you in the ""mind"" of a mentally ill person. Give it a try!"
2,Planet bag?,"My peeve is that the bag isn't organic cotton. Cotton needs so many pesticides, I just find this bag counter-productive."
5,Digitally remastered,"Mana treats us with this compilation of their greatest hits along with Sol y Luna. Mana's most powerful and touching songs fill these cds including some bonus tracks such as celoso and fool in the rain....a must have for any mana fan....The music videos that come with these cds are also a plus...although one song that isnt on any of the 3 cds is donde jugaron los niños which is very strange since that song is very popular....all in all if your old mana cds are all scratched and damaged this is the way to go...listening to the greatest pop rock band to ever come out of Guadalajara, Jalisco.....also praise goes to sergio vallin, ivan ""vampiro"" Lopez, and ullyses calleros for their briliant guitar work throughout the years they are great with the backup of rhythm section juan ""the statue"" calleros on bass and the great Alex ""el animal"" Gonzalez on drums(which is considered one of the top latin american drummers in the world) Buy all three of these new cds its worth it."
1,Save your money,"These collections of CDs are a piece of crap. Why make 3 cds of the greatests hits if they don't even have that many studio albums? The simple answer is money. They've lost the talent to make another studio album so they just live off their past glory. They put a nice cover a recycled songs and ""enhance"" the cd. So stupid unknowing fans will go out and buy it. If you already have their past albums no need to buy this garbage. If you have bought it you're out of luck. A blank CD is worth more than this crap."
3,Insight Guides Tenerife: Western Canary Islands,"This book sends too much time focusing on the history of the island. It is great if you are interested in the history and culture of Tenerife. However, it is not a practical travel guide. There is not enough detail on the best places to go if you are interested in traveling to Tenerife. I would not recommend carrying this book along as a ready reference guide."
1,Thumbs down,"This book is very poorly written. There are many typographical errors throughout the book and many, many inaccuracies in the content. Some terms are used incorrectly and instead of assisting the reader in learning civil litigation, it creates confustion and frustration.I would not recommend this book to anyone - especially students.I hope the new edition is worth the paper it's written on."
3,headstrong,"Callie's finally back in the saddle and she's found her dream horse. However, she is being stalked and things come to a head when she is out on the trails, miles from any help or safety. Carole and Cam go at it hot and heavy some more. Lisa tries seeing other people, after taking a break from her relationship with Alex. And Stevie's busy helping Max with the Starlight Ride, an annual Pine Hollow tradition."
4,Too much romance,"Okay, so I know these are for teens but the romance seems to take over these books. I LOVE HORSES and want to read horse stuff. a alittle guy stuff is okay, but let's keep the horse story the most important thing. A great horse mystery--with a little romance is Shadow Horse. Get it for Christmas!"
5,Brilliant Book!,"This book was really good, i loved it! The PH series is really good! I cant wait to read PH 15, i would highly recomend this book, I could hardly put it down, lots happened in it!"
4,Literatura chicana,"This book was in great condition, considering that it was used....Great price too. Thank You."
3,100% happy,Fobus is a top quality product. I ordered my holster.and it arrived as planned however it took about a little over a month to get but hey im not in a rush. I only gave it a 3 star because of how long it took. Any way im satisfied with my purchase and probably buy again....thankyou amazon
2,hmmmmmm.,this product does not work with glock 37 magazines. may be fine with 45 acp. i am returning for my money.
2,Gave me blisters at first,these boots are ok for the price - they do they job but gave me blisters when I first wore them and they don't make a great connection with the ball so they won't improve your game.
5,Presicion through simplicity,"As an individual unfamiliar with the nuances of AS, I found ""My Social Stories Book"" particularly effective in identifying, conveying and demystifying what is mundane for most people, but what can be overwhelming for those with AS. Sean McAndrew's brilliant translation of the text via child-friendly illustrations relevant to their respective scenarios are what make a publication like this one truly work. Much like crosswalk symbols, these illustrations must be absolutely simplistic in order to be unmistakeably understood. Much respect to McAndrew who rendered the abstract idea of divorce in such tender illustrative grace."
3,School Use,"The book itself was ok, but what I bought it for was to use it during school time and it didn't have much to use at school. What I needed was social stories I could use with my students at school situations. For home and outside of school there was some great social stories but not enough for me."
2,Didn't live up to the Hype,I bought the book after reading heaps of info about Carol Gray and her social stories. Unfortunately the book could possibly benefit 3 year olds and young 4 year olds. Certainly children any older will not get any benefit from it. For me it was a complete waste of money and I have since donated the book to the local library.
2,biOrb Volcano with Plants - large,"First of all, my volcano with plants looks NOTHING like the pictured one!Second, it was too tall for my 16 gallon container so my husband had to cut it off so we could put the light back in the tank. The water, which was newly cleaned, has been cloudy ever since -maybe from the volcano?"
5,Kill the Craving,"This book was great. The concept is so realistic and simple but the actual sessions seem unbelievable. I would love to experience them myself. If you have any trainings. let me know, I want to tell my therapist about ERP.Thanks,"
1,the tablet,"This book does just what I thought it would do. Nothing. The LDS church is the opposite of love. They are money hungry, control freaks. Their agenda is control and they determine the way things should be, and convince others through instilling fear. If you turn your back on your children, and don't support them, YOU should not be a parent. And beyond that...you should remember, according to the mormon chuch, whether or not your son/daughter is alive, YOU created them. And if you hate what they have become, because of who they love, what the HELL does that say about you. You are the f'ing freaks."
2,"Well-intended, but the overall message is a bit hopeless","While the writers try to be hopeful and helpful, their overall message is depressing. Many people have overcome same-sex attraction and moved on with their lives. The two stories in this book give the impression that the only outcomes are to commit suicide or just live with it your whole life. There are other options! You aren't born that way, and you don't have to just live with it! See [...]for a rather lengthy review."
1,Sunpack battery,"When I received this new battery, in its original packaging, it was nearly dead. Apparently, old stock is not rotated at this vendor and the shelf life of this product had elapsed."
2,How To Make A Silencer For A .22,Too technical for the average person to build. You almost need a machine shop to construct this silencer.
1,A waste of money,I found that this book and directions were completely mumble Jumble. If any one can make a workable silencer from these directions he must be the smartest person in the world or it was a fluke.
1,Dangerous at any speed,"As this book is only supplied for academic purposes you would think that it would actually be written well and include information that would be useful for academic purposes revolving around silencers, unfortunately it supply's nothing of the sort.The information contained is inaccurate to the point of being absurd.Look elsewhere for academic study material on this topic."
2,Won't silence a .22,"When I saw this book (decades ago) in a friend's collection, I was inspired to make my own silencer.There are 2 components to sound coming from a gun:1) The muzzle blast2) The sound of the bullet traveling at super-sonic speeds as it breaks the sound barrier!!!A 22LR shell exits the muzzle at over 1300 feet per second. Do the math! That translates to 886 Miles Per Hour - well over the sonic barrier (500 to 700 MPH depending on altitude and barometric pressure).You can suppress the blast, but when you do, you still hear the crack as the bullet breaks the sound barrier.A few other cartridges that are super-sonic are: 9MM, Super 38, .357, .41Mag and .44 Mag. So how do you totally eliminate any tell-tale sound? Use a lower velocity cartridge.As a rule of thumb, don't use a revolver; you should use an automatic pistol. The ideal pistol: .380 AUTO.One other thing to consider. Silencers are illegal. If you are caught you could be shot or embark on an extended vacation at Club Fed."
2,You get what you pay for...,"Not weighted, not real leather, plastic base, and stitching is really off-white.It does fit fine though..."
5,Run OK under Windows XP Prof SP3,"Very good educational software. Run OK under Windows XP Prof SP3. Set ""run at 640 x 480 resolution"" in the properties of MB6-7.EXE if you want to run it full screen."
4,Good lunch item or snack...,"Great fresh taste, nice size for lunches or a snack. Easy to keep in the car or purse for a fast fix."
5,Introduction to UML,Best introduction in UML. Easy and complete (for almost 99% of UML you ever use). Buy it!
4,Ideal book for UML begginers/intermediate,"Very easy book to read. Fowler and Scott are good writers.Be a favor to yourself if you are an UML begginer: buy it.If you want take the IBM 486 test, its enough. Read it twice to pass the test, and also read the Patterns section of Larman Book...."
4,Rather too compressed,"If you are familiar with the principles of object oriented programming but you are not familiar with UML standards of OMG, and if your time is short and a condensed reader's digest is what you need, then this is the book for you... and even then, only as a starting point. If you want to do anything serious with UML you shall need more. I have given this 4 stars for what the book is; for many readers' requirements it is worth less."
3,Good intro to UML,"This thin book is a good introduction to UML. If one wants that, then it's 5 stars. But destilled could also mean ""only the essence"" so that it could be used as a reference, but this is not the case here. I recommend the three books from the gurus Booch, Jacobson, Rambaugh. Then one is at the source of UML."
3,Kindle version missing inside cover diagrams,The Kindle version is missing two of the four pages of diagrams at the beginning and end of the book. For a quick summary those are very important. The very first and very last inside cover diagrams are the ones missing. Amazon needs to fix this. It's really noticeable if you've had the print version.
4,UML Distilled 3rd Edition,This is a good book to have as a reference and to get an introductory understanding into UML. Many engineers at the company that I work at have this book and also at previous companies that I've worked at.
4,Very good,This book contains almost everything you have to know about UML. It's best quality is that it's a very short book and very easy to read.
2,should be distilled into a chapter less than 50 pages,"This book should be distilled into a chapter less than 50 pages, which means the rest 150 or so pages are basically nothing. I took Software Engineering at school, where I received more information in 9 hours than reading this book."
3,A decent summary of OOP and UML but pedagogically unsound,"For a book as short as this one, I expected a more well-written book. The chapter of use-case diagrams seemed USEless. He started off that chapter with a good written example, but then chose to display a diagram related to a different example that was never explained! It gave me the impression that he did not know how to draw these diagrams with a tool, so he decided to steal the diagrams of others, even if they were not representative of the book's examples. This book may be ok for the average programmer who wants something quick to read to give them the false impression that they ""know"" UML. But for a textbook, which was the purpose it served me and my students, I would have preferred a book that gave solid defintions and stuck to them."
5,Concise and well written overview of UML,"If you need to learn UML this is a great book. It is well written in that everything is concise and descriptive. Examples of what diagrams should have and look like are given throughout so with the help of some diagramming software anyone can produce UML diagrams.You might be disapointed though when you receive this book and see how small it is. Usually, when I pay $$ for a book, it is at least 4 times this size of this baby."
4,Simple and concise,Simple and very concise way of teaching UML.I would recommend this to any beginner.May not be for an advance learner. The reference materials suggested are also good.
3,"Good book, but too many personal opinion","I think this book is good. But it seems a lot of personal opinion of the author. And it makes me confused, which one is better or is that still best practice till today. The book is almost 7 years old.I am bored and not get much from chapter 13 to chapter 17. The author also tell us those diagrams are not useful till the author wrote (UML 2.0 is still new that day)."
4,Will cover all important aspects of UML,"This book is what i call, lets get Down and dirty. Its a quick and dirty way of learning UML. for practical purposes this book is highly useful, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn UML and start out his way...Anirudh vyas"
2,"not good for beginners, not good for experts","This book would be fine if it were the only UML book on the planet. But there are several much, much better UML books out there. This was a poor effort that appears as if it were hastily prepared. There is as much information about Fowler's favorite ways to write incorrect UML as there is about how to write correct UML. At least the difference is fairly well labeled.Beginners may find it hard to distinguish between what is normative and what is Fowler's way. Experts should know well enough to buy a more comprehensive book."
4,A nice agile distillation of UML,"20-80 rule applied here: the authoer focused on the 20% of the most useful UML concept and notation, gave a clear and easy-to-read distillation of them.I had read the UML User Guide by the 3 amigo, and was fairly familiar with UML before read this book. I still find it quite interesting to read, especially when the user give his own opinion and advice of how to apply UML to real life project - some people don't like it, but I find the advice quite valuable. The author is an early practioner and important contributor of OOA&D, he followed the spirit of the low ceremony agile software development in the book, which I found very practical.Recommended as a UML must read!"
3,Average Book from a Well Respected Programmer,"This is an average UML book. It is generally well written, and does a broad coverage of the topic. However, it could be better if more examples are provided. The quick-reference system on the backs of both front and back cover pages is of great value for quick references.As a side note, although Chapter 2 on Development Process does not have much to do with UML in general, I find it to be of great value."
4,Reference book for UMlL diagrams,"This is a handy reference book for UML diagrams. I like the quick summary on the inside covers, useful when you want to a quick reminder of which UML diagram is the one you want to use. I find it helpful that instead of spending pages and pages describing some of the hardly used notations, it actually concentrates on describing the essentials and the typical. If I then find I need more information on a certain diagram, I just go find it in the internet. It is not an in-depth explanation of object modeling."
3,Too Terse,"This book is probably for a good overview if you already know UML and need a refesh. Defintely not a book to learn UML. There are other better books who do explained more clearly. One that I like so far is ""UML and RUP: Practical Object-Oriented Design and Analysis"" by Jim Arlow which more concise and practical.My opinion is this book is still too terse and bombastic like the other 3 books by the 3 amigos."
1,Not better that a free tutorial,"If are an UML expert who needs a quick reference guide, then this is your book. If you are new to UML don't waist you money. Rather download this free tutorial: http://uml.tutorials.trireme.com/uml_tutorial.zip"
2,mediocre,"There is really a sore need of a book that can teach UML modelling with a NO-[nonsense] kind of approach. Alas, the tendency is not this one...This book does take a more concrete and sensible approach to UMLbut is mostly superficial and when it goes into details it does so in a very confusing and inelegant way. I suspect the true reason of its popularity is that compared with other books on the subject this is at least a SHORT pain in the b. ;)"
3,Not for the 486 exam,"I bought this book to prepare the IBM 486 exam and I don't think it's a good choice.The subjects are exposed in a disordered way that may be ok for a first approach, but not to prepare an exam.I suggest the Kruchten book first, and may be this one as a complement."
2,I was warned---------,This text was required for one of my Java classes. I was warned about the self agrandizement of this author and the warnings held true. I am a novice programmer and the condescending tone of this book turned me off even tho I'm sure the book is well written if you need someone to tell you that his methods are the only ones with merit.Would not have purchased on my own.
2,It is not what it should have been,I have been reading this book for the last 10 days chapter after chapter. I definitely feel there is some good content in the book. However it not what it should have been.I read a comment on this book saying author padded lot of stuff. I do agree with that up to some extent.This is what I expected from this book:1. 2/3 chapters explaining various UML diagrams2. Solving different problems using UML3. Exercises & Quizs
4,very good worthful book for money.....,This is the second book which iam reading at present.where i found this book is very usuful for learning basics of uml.and my first bookm i had studied is uml user guide which is also very usuful book but in detailed book.if u have patience to read book u can go to user guide.but uml distilled is very short book but author covered every point ..overall this is very good book which u can buy .
1,"Really cute, but useless","I bought 2 of these for Christmas and had to replace the batteries for one of them to work at all. Very cute, but not what we expected. Hard mechanical parts inside the pig. Not recommended."
2,lame!... (but cute),this is the cutest furreal I have seen it could have been much better if they would have made it where it would open it's mouth. ...Why did it come with a bottle? all ir does is grunt and beg. doesn't walk and it's eyes do not close so you can't pretend it is asleep. I can't return it cause it was a valantine's present but at least it is cute as just a stuffed pig.
5,Super cute piglet !,I bought this for my 8 year old niece who absolutely loved it !! She collects pigs & said this is the cutest one in her collection.
4,"Super coffee, but sole in the 18 vs. 25 count box","As others have stated, this is an EXCELLENT bold, dark-roast coffee. Flavor that keeps on giving.Unfortunately, Amazon and others only sell this in the 18-count box vs. the 25-count boxes of other flavors. That makes it much more expensive than competing brands."
4,nice bold flavor!,"this coffee is really good. it has a bold flavor without leaving a harsh aftertaste. before this one, i really enjoyed van houtte's kenya kilimandjaro. i think eclipse is my new favorite. i'm also really enjoying newman's own special blend extra bold."
3,"Good flavor, but a bit bitter","After reading these reviews, I went out and picked up a box of this stuff. Overall it is a decent dark roast, but I was disappointed at its bitter aftertaste. It has a decent flavor overall, but the bitterness lingers after your sip. If you're looking for a nice bold flavor without the bitterness, I would recommend Van Houtte Kenya Kilimanjaro, but my favorite is Green Mountain Dark Magic, which has loads of dark flavor without the bitterness. Espresso blend is good too."
2,don't care for this one,I was excited after reading the good reviews to get this CD. The voice on this tape made me tense. I felt it was too fast as well. I've had other CD's that had a more soothing voice and were done at a much slower relaxing pace.
2,Boring,I did not like this CD. It is only a male voice walking you thru it. I wanted music but there was none.
4,it is a good and informative cd teaching you how to reduce stress,I would recommend this product to anyone needing to reduce stress in their life. I especially like to music that accompanied.
2,deep water,"Mah, la storia fa veramente pena, Coburn è bravo come sempre anche se in là con l'età . il resto degli attorucoli e la storia in se è proprio insipida."
3,An extremely ambitious script!,"This movie had all the dramatic factors to catch our attention and interest. A terrorist faction, an important girl to be watched and the always sensible nuclear premise.But with such ties to disentangle, there is a hidden risk to dismiss one of the main ethic conflicts; unless you have a hidden Ace or may to lead the film over two hours and a half.As whole entertainment the film is enjoyable to watch, but it could have been still better."
3,SHARK HAD NO TEETH!!!!,"DEEP WATER is certainly no ""Poseidon Adventure"" but for a tidal wave capsizing a luxury liner rip-off, it entertained me enough not to totally trash it. The funniest thing about the film is that when the shark makes its way onto the capsized vessel, he doesn't have any teeth. He must not be a killer shark, or else he gummed his victims to death?? Anyway, the late James Coburn took home a paycheck for his almost cameo role, and Finola Hughes was almost sexy as the villainous tv reporter. I think Larry Poindexter who played the supporting role of Lazo would have been better in the lead role played by Costas Mandylor. Larry seemed to be more of a heroic type and is basically a better actor than the somewhat hunkier Mandylor. Alex Hyde-White did not ooze enough villainry to be a good ""Ghost"" and there are no real surprises. DEEP WATER is a mediocre, but enjoyable little straight to DVDer!"
2,Deep Debt,"My guess is they lost money on this one. Although James Coburn certainly turns in a good performance as the Captain of a Navy Aircraft Carrier, we don't see that much of him. Costas Mandylor tries hard as a macho Navy Seal but just can't carry the movie by himself. The rest of the perfomances are mediocre. It comes close to being a worthy film but doesn't quite make it. I think a good acting bad man like John Lithgow or Gary Oldman would have made it work, but the group of kidnappers aboard the cruise ship just don't have what it takes."
4,Quite wordy but interesting as a reference book.,I ended up selling this book after having skimmed through it. It's very wordy and not so easy to get around in. Probably a good reference book.
5,One of the best books I've read all year!,"Dark Lord is wonderfully written! It kept me up way past my bedtime, and its been awhile since a book has done that to me! I'm definatly adding this book to my list of favorites! I can't wait until the next book comes out!"
2,More Enigma please.,"I purchased this album hoping to hear more Enigma like music, Although I am a huge fan and will listen to Enigma till I die, I was disappointed when I listen to the album, it was sold in the store under the Enigma name, this is why I bought it. Sorry to say, but this album sounds like Yanni in French, it has small amounts of the magic that Enigma does, but none of the raw powerful, soulful, meaningful sounds that the three Enigma CD's have. Please make the monks chant again............ More Enigma."
2,whitney houston???,this is a question. what song does whitney houston sing on? She is part of the listing for this album.
3,"Started out great, but it lost something along the way","I started this book a couple of evenings ago and was so excited, talking about it in work the next day, how wonderful it was! Somehow over the next couple of reading sessions I started losing my enthusiasm for the story. Ida was a pip indeed! Kay was a bit pathetic but I still had hope for her. Her father, Francis, was despicable, her husband Neal was an irritating, uninteresting whimp. Thankfully, she had her friend Zabeth, who was an absolute hoot! These characters were all so enjoyable at first, but as the story progressed it seemed to drag and become bland, I can't quite put my finger on it. I do see great talent here and would like to read some of Ms. Giles' short stories. Perhaps this book would've been better as a short story and there just wasn't enough material here to keep my interest peaked?! In any case, not a bad read at all, it ""grabbed"" me initially, but let go somewhere in the middle."
2,SHE NEVER GETS A CLUE,"Middleaged Kay has spent her entire life trying to please parents who are incapable of caring about anybody but themselves. Ida and Francis are so completely selfabsorbed and destructive that they have no business being parents. Ida has competed with her daughter for every scrap of positive attention and she has managed to controll everything in Kay's life. However, although this is hinted at by Kay's female friend, it is never conceptionalized. Very little changes after Ida's death and I had to wonder what the point was. The writing is pretty good and I found it fairly humorous but was so frustrated by the sense that Kay is NEVER going to get it."
4,"Full of enligtening thoughts, but...","I enjoy reading the large variety of enlightening sayings, parables, poetry and other thougts within its pages. The book is separated into eight key areas (or chapters): The Knowledge, Sharing, Intentions, Actions, Lifewish, Quest, Attitude and Focus. The type is clearly set within the pages in the same font family with a variety of font sizes, font styles (narrow, regular and bold) Improvements that could be made include, adding the names of the chapters in the same small print next to the page number, so the reader relates the context of the saying towards, for example, Actions. Also, only a very small handful of the 1000 thoughts include who is the originator of the saying, which sometimes is just as fascinating.Even with its shortcomings, I still recommend buying this book or one of the Thousand Path series books (i.e., A Thousand Paths to Wisdom, A Thousand Paths to Happiness) and placing at your work desk to scan and remember what's really important."
5,absolutely fabulous,I really enjoyed reading this book. It was well written and very poignant. I have a new respect for anyone who goes through this experience. Barbara Barrie is a very strong woman and courageous to share her story. I thank her for it.
1,Just Awful,"Lott is one of the lazy mystery/thriller writers who, instead of unraveling the plot - and exposing the villain - slowly and intricately throughout the book, just has the villains detail all their crimes (and the reasons for them) to the heroes. Fiction dosn't get any lazier than that. The book is dull, not suspenseful, and by the end, you couldn't care less who the villain is or what the motive is. Awful. Just plain awful."
1,Cure for sleeplessness,"Absolutely boring. Although 240 pages is not a long book, I continued to fall asleep while trying to read it. Filthy language, unbelieveable plot, & had it not been part of my book club, I would have not finished it. I would not recommend this book to ANYONE!!!"
3,Very good but sluggish second half. . .,"Bret Lott is a great writer, very lyrical and fluid. It's a joy to read his writing -- to an extent. What brings this book down is the muddled plot and the way that the second half doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Reading Huger's thoughts and feelings is fascinating, and Lott's descriptions of the South are wonderful -- being a transplanted Southerner myself, reading this book only makes me long more severely for my home state. But I was really disappointed by the way that it seems he felt he had to give the plot a lot of twists and complications. The pleasure I got from reading this book stemmed from his artful use of characters and how everything affected them, not the flimsy murder-suspense plot. I was glued to it at the beginning, but as I approached the end, my interest began to wane."
5,very good first thriller,"I got this book initially from the library, loved it, and lost it in my house before finishing the last 30 pages, so I went to Amazon to buy a copy. It is very hard to find in paperback. Lott is not known for his thrillers, and this was his first endeavor in the genre. Fans generally know him for his ""oprah book club"" novel ""Jewel."" This was very entertaining and may be an oldie but definitely a goodie."
1,A really cute piece of garbage.,"My two daughters saw these in a retail store and HAD TO HAVE THEM. We bought them. While both containers insulated well, both would leak at times, and the the handle on the cup portion is poorly designed and broke off the first day my younger daughter used it! After one week of problems neither girl would use them anymore. A real waste of my money!"
4,Soup Thermos,"This is a cute thermos BUT, if you reconstitute your soup from the average Campbell's soup, it will not all fit in the thermos. However, it does serve it's purpose and keeps the product warm."
2,Super cute. Super useless.,"I love, love, love the design of this. It's absolutely adorable. It's also a great size. Fits perfectly into my insulated lunch bag. Unfortunately, it does not keep my soup hot at all.I have no means to heat up my soup when I go to eat it 5 hours after I packed it up. Ergo, the need for me to purchase a thermos for my soup. However, my soup is always stone cold when I go to eat it. Even if I did have access to a microwave, the container is not microwave safe.I'm extremely disappointed."
2,"Other than being cute, has no use","I bought this thermos in hopes of taking soup to work with me for lunch. This thermos did not keep my soup hot at all. It is also a little too small to hold enough soup for a meal. May be good for a child's portion, but you'd have to reheat at lunch time."
2,Junk,"I bought this to keep soup warm when on the road. I preheated it before putting in the soup and it still consistently failed. When you add a warm liquid, the outside feels warm, so it is plainly obvious that is it losing heat and not doing a bit to keep the contents warm. It is now going to be a decoration because it isn't worth much else."
3,"Really cute, but not very functional.","I bought this thermos to take with me to school and have a hot lunch, but it simply has not been able to retain heat in the food. Very cute, but I just haven't been able to make it work out as functional AND cute yet. However, I really like the cup included as a lid, really great design."
3,Thorough but frustratingly so,"I have to disagree with whoever said this is a great book for beginners. There is too much information to the point of overkill. I am getting more enlightenment from going to www.omg.org and reading the UML specs. The author interjects way too much unnecessary information, then takes a good example model (like on the back page) using default language, only to throw ""veggieburger"" in the middle of it all, which to a novice lends only to confusion.I am in the middle of reading this so I may change my stripes by the end, but I really don't see it happening. ""UML 2 Toolkit"" and ""Head First Design"" have helped me learn this stuff much faster."
2,CONFUSING,"I found this book to be confusing because it goes back and forth a lot on the ideas within UML. It also does not do a good job at explaining vocabulary specific to UML. I was very lost in some parts of the book. If it wasnt for my professor's powerpoint summaries of each chapter, I would have been completely lost."
5,Great for learning OOA/D,I've come from a mainframe background. I took C++ and Java classes and still didn't know how to design OO. This book has helped me cross that bridge. Highly recommended!
3,Good follow-up,"This second installment of the Abby & Ophelia series is a decent follow-up to the debut, Witch Way to Murder. I'm really, REALLY picky about my mystery novel heroines, and for the most part I like Ophelia. The only thing I can see myself becoming really disappointed with is that the story seems to be moving towards a romance between Ophelia and the cop, Comacho. It's just so trite. Just ONCE I would like to read a mystery series written by a woman and featuring a female protagonist that doesn't stoop to the 'romance with the sexy cop' schtick. It's so overdone. Comacho is not at all likeable in the first place, despite the author's attempts to showcase him as some sexy Latino muscleman with a secret soft spot for kids (gag, vomit, hurl). If anything turns me off this series in the end, it will be that. I'll invest in the 3rd one when it comes out, but I have a feeling I might drop it after that. We'll see; maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised!"
4,Good mystery with an improved Ophelia.,"Ophelia is starting to show off her mettle in this book as she takes on the issue of Brian's death, something that has haunted her for years. She's beginning to come out of her shell, thanks to Darci, Rick, and Abby, but unfortunately still finding dead bodies. The mystery involving the pig farm is great to me, I don't know why I liked it so much. As for the rest of the mystery, I found the villian's backstory as somewhat outlandish but it works and I like his methods for the story so I'm not going to nag about it. The information about the witch trials and runes was also really cool to learn. I felt like Comacho was just a red herring as a possible love interest for Ophelia, especially since she dislikes him with such vehemence in the beginning and Rick is out of the picture. Bill is as funny as ever as he threatens Ophelia with jail time for her ""bumbling"". Can't wait for the next!"
2,disappointed,"I really liked the first book and was looking forward to the second one. This book's writing was choppier than the first which I forgave for growing pains and a first book. How many times can a person say ""dang?"" I just think of some teenager going ""dddaaaaaaaang."" And the dialogue is awkward. When she says he has a ""nice butt""? Not funny. And do ""singles bars"" really exist anymore? The plot, however, moved fast, and the scenes with Abby's ""magick"" and Ophelia's psychic crime solving were good."
3,3.5 Okay,"I read the first book of this series and was very intrigued by the characters and the story. But the premise of book 2 did not grab me the way the first story did.I did enjoy the interaction between Abby and Ophelia and the closure that Ophelia was able to get in Brian's murder. But the trouble with PP international pig plant and the in your face attitude that Ophelia had with just about everyone in this book, got on my nerves a little.My friend has read all the books and has encouraged me to keep reading because they just get better and better, so even though I'm a bit discouraged I think I will read book 3 before I make a decision on weither to keep going with the series."
1,Do not waste your money!!!,"I bought this book, and I believe the title of this book is misleading. No biomedical scientist needs the book like this.Do you believe that ""time""""timer""""tissue""""try"" were ""comprehensive terminology""?"
5,One of the Best Wrestler Autobiographies,"William Regal has quite literally been around the world during his career as a professional wrestler, and this book covers the highs and lows of the entire process.From his start as a skinny kid wrestling in Blackpool to his current status as a WWE Superstar, Regal's story is highlighted by stories about the behind the scenes world of wrestling: some of it hilarious, some interesting, and some heart-breaking.Regal also deals candidly with his alcohol and drug problems and all the pain it caused him. This is perhaps the most engaging part of the story: Regal pulls no punches in discussing the pain he put his family through and how he nearly lost his life because of his addictions.Highly recommended if you're a wrestling fan or looking for books on the real-life impact of alcohol and drug dependency."
5,Regal is the man...,"I first became a fan of William Regal when he worked Bill Goldberg and showed him how a real wrestler works during a WCW Saturday Nights Main Event... It was during Bill Goldberg's ""undefeated"" streak... Regal worked Goldberg so hard that I immediately became a fan...The book provides outstanding, if not painful, insight into the life and career of William Regal. Anytime Regal walks to the ring, get ready for an outstanding match..."
2,Ok but nothing more,"I have read that this was one of the better wrestling books ever written so I read it with interest to find that it was readable but little else.The story of a man who wanted to be a wrestler and started off at the carnivals in England then progressed to the US, where he found fame but also drugs.I think the problem with the book was the lack of depth to the writing. We were told that Regal wrestled for years but you wouldn't know it based on the anecdotes and stories that were told (very minimal).There is very little about the wrestlers indeed very little of substance in the book."
1,Are you people serious!,"I can't believe people on here are actually saying this is a good book...it is not...do not believe them. A few people I know have read this book and we all agreed after...its boring as hell...that and every story ends with...""and I goit high"" and some drug tie in, it was like ok we get it your the Brit Jake Roberts. Just not a good read. I remember thinking...WWE must be running out of guys to write books about."
5,great but...,...the screw-on version in not adjustable from inside the cabinet. The product description led me to think otherwise. I think the press-in version is adjustable from inside the cabinet with a screwdriver.
5,Great Shoes,"These are the best shoes I have ever bought. When I tried them on in the store my feet felt weightless and very comfortable. Over a year later they have held up to countless miles on all kinds of surfaces. This is an easy recommend, at least until next week when the 1350s come out."
2,Okay,This game is okay but it's kind of stupid. the shipping was fast and the quality is great but I bought this because of the price and I was looking for an easy fun game to play. This game just is weird and stupid. Save your money for a better game.
3,It is fun and a challenge,This is a fun challenge. It is too difficult for very young children. It requires speed and dexterity.
5,monkeys R 4 luvin',"got this for my 13 yr olddaughter, she loves it. Kept her quiet on a 725 mile drive back from grandma's."
3,Not as much fun as other monkey ball games,"I Bought this game thinking that it would be as good as the other versions of this game. i ended up being pretty disappointed. the story mode on this game is extremly short and once you beat that, the only reason to play this game is for the mini games. 2 of the minigames, out of the 6, are actually fun (Golf, Air hockey,). if you like to play repetitive mini games, then buy this game. otherwise don't."
1,oh my god!,"I bought this game because i loved supermonkeyball on the wii! this game is so fustrating that I wanted to kill myself, put the game on top of me, and write a note on it that says it is all your fault supermonkey ball!!! not really :) but I was reallllyyyy fustrated and on the verge of tears on the second level of this kid's game!!! my god! cant someone make these games just a little more easy?"
2,Boring,"Hey y'all I beat this game in literally 30 minutes. The gameplay is choppy and I doesnt prefer the graphics. ""Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one."" This best descibes the game."
4,A Fun Addition to the DS,"Super Monkey Ball Touch & Roll is an obsessively fun game where you control a little monkey in a ball, and you have to roll him all around obsacle courses to reach the goal-with a time limit! I loved Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2 for the Gamecube, and was addicted to Monkey Ball Jr. for the GameBoy Advance, so I found 'Super Monkey Ball Touch & Roll' to be a neat addition to my DS library.There are, however, some drawbacks. This version of Monkey Ball does not have the small map on the screen like previous Monkey Ball games, and I found this a downside. Also, on Monkey Race, in the party game section, you cannot use the D-pad to move. Once you get the hang of using the stylus, though, it gets pretty easy.All in all, this game was fun and quite easy. I would reccomend it for all ages."
2,Probably great for kids but not adults,"As an adult gamer, I thought I'd try this game and see what it's about.If you like driving or racing games, this is for you.It reminds me of Pac n Roll DS where the pac man rolls down lanes. This game is similar. You have to roll the ball with the monkey inside it down certain paths, collect bananas along the way and race against time to the goal. That's basically it for this game.I can see where kids would enjoy this simple & cute game. The graphics are nice and in 3D. The stylus can be used in this game but the buttons are preferred for better control.I am not into racing or driving games so in my opinion, I gave this 2 stars."
5,Fun game for younger kids,"I recently purchased this game for my 6 year old son. It is now his favorite DS title. Monkey Ball contains an entire collection of fun action games.Pros:- Contains a collection of fun action games on one ""disk""- Easy to use for younger children - no reading required- Fun with no violence- It seems to be challenging- Kids up to college age borrow the game and have fun with itCons:- Repetitive music could drive parents crazy during long car rides (-;"
4,A good Game for kids,This game is a good game for younger kids. It is not violent and teaches kids the bacis of Math. This game is a fun and challanging game to play. Lots of kids don't like doing problems so this game can make it a fun way for kids to learn Math
4,Another example of some great storytelling!,"This ia a very well written, edited and photographed film about one of the great ""What If"" Battles of the First World War. I frankly thought it was really the only imaginative plan put forth in that war. I think that if it had been properly supported and led by The British it could of been pulled off. But instead it was treated as a sideshow and the Brits tried to do it on the cheap. So it was doomed from the start.Altogether well worth the coin and time to see if this is your forte of History."
5,"Want it in my car, my purse, by my bed, on my desk...to end, email, pray, meditate on","I am not one for preformed prayers either, but love these scripture based cards. They teach and encourage me to be a godly parent, even as I pray for those traits in my children. I would so love to have these cards in an app for youVersion app so I could pray for me kids, and sent the prayer to them. We have so little ""uncluttered"" time to sit down and just pray."
5,Razor-Sharp Prose,"This book is arresting in its intelligence and exceptional prose. It is a must-read book about Dylan's political development. Marquesee is a careful listener and has grasped the zeitgeist of the age.Marquesee clearly sympathizes with Dylan's use of song as a political weapon, and he explains with great zeal and fervor how Dylan wielded that weapon. I think he misses an emerging spiritual consciousness in Dylan's songs, though, by the exclusive focus on the politics.Still, anyone who wishes to understand the political world in which Dylan sang should read this book for its keen insights and unfailingly precise language.--Lawrence J. Epstein, author ofPolitical Folk Music in America from Its Origins to Bob Dylan"
1,More 1960's Left Wing Politics than Dylan Biography,"I purchased this book without knowing that the author's focus was at least as much on politics as Bob Dylan. I thought I was buying a Dylan biography but was greatly disappointed. In case others may be misled by the packaging please know that the author is so devoted to adulation of socialist/communist/left wing politics that Bob Dylan the person, songwriter, musician and performer is definitely secondary. Although the book was reasonably well-written and appears to have been researched the author's unwavering obsession with politics and his overt political bias is quite annoying. If you are a political partisan you might like the book. If you think you are buying a biography of Bob Dylan you may be disappointed."
5,Compelling read.,"`Gripping story of global proportions, masterfully told. The characters are real. The situations are too. Truly an enjoyable read that holds great promise for the screen...or even a sequel? Thank you Timothy J. Korzep...and bravo!"
4,Going for the throat!,"His first novel, Final Approval, examined the possibilities of how deep and ugly the so-called great democracy could go but this time in the Kondrateiff Crisis, Korzep is even scarier. That's because while his characters may be fictional, what happens to them essentially is not - it's the story, in part, of what happened to millions of innocent investors who in the past five years got completely dot-conned. Exciting pace with some clever twists, many amateur investors may even get some vicarious satisfaction in the novel's resolution."
5,RAT KING ROCKS!,This was one of the best Deathlands books to come out for awhile. Finally the characters are in character and the action was tightly written. When you find out what the RAT KING is - it is nothing like what you would expect. Superb writing like this is what makes this series a classic hit! Keep up the good work.
5,Rat King is no dog!,"Yes! That's right, kiddies! Read Rat King now because it's a strong story with well-rounded characterization of the characters. I'm hoping to see more badinage between Doc and the gang in future installments because one can use the Doc's antedeluvian inisghts to create great jokes. Deathlands should have at least one great laugh in it, like old times. This ghost writer is delivering consistent quality, and hopefully more fresh surprises as we all continue on our Deathlands journeys -- hopefully more detail on each character, and more arctic adventures, including some jumps to alien planets such as Mars, with time spent more on what is found there is what I favor most. More discoveries of technological weapons and other inventions would elevate the series into more sophisticated levels of chills and thrills too.Put it this way, it ain't going to hurt!"
2,How Not to Interview actors and crew.,It would have been more professional of the person interviewing the cast and crew of The Office to have talked less and let the actors talk more. The interview was painful to watch because the person who was interviewing did not involve everyone on stage. This is a great short to watch if you want to see how NOT to interview a whole cast and crew and demonstrate the lack of professionalism.
4,Lots of great Ideas I can't wait to try.,"This book is great fun, but I haven't had the opportunity to execute any of them just yet. This is really for a special occasion."
3,The weakest point in Muti's Tchaikovsky cycle.,"This Tchaikovsky's 1st is with no doubt the weakest point in Muti's generally good complete cycle.In agreement with other reviewers, despite a very good playing from Philharmonia's forces, there's alack in color and lyricism, sacrificed for speed and unadequate pomp. I can't recognize the marvelous,evocative and dreamy atmospheres put on paper by Tchaikovsky hearing this performance. Cannot recommendit. For really superb recordings of this beautiful symphony, you could go for Jansons (Chandos), Abbadoin Chicago (Sony), the deservedly famous Tilson Thomas (DG) and, best of all, Karajan (DG), that is withno doubt my favorite and absolut reference."
5,A fantastic book,I really found this to be a fantastic book and gave me a new outlook on the world around me. It truly deserves your attention. You will find that it is very revealing about your own life. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
5,Thoughful book,"On my recent jouney towards spiritual awareness I came across this book at a friend's house. I had heard about Mr. Hubband from time to time, the media has continuously bashed him so I thought I would give it a try. I found the precepts in the book thought provoking and have found them to be true. I think this is worth passing on to others to read. It may help you live a better life and find contentment."
1,"Tedious, poorly organized, etc.","This book contains excerpts from several of Hubbard's other books, and in a couple cases from lectures. For a book the Church of Scientology pushes heavily, it's pretty awful. Almost all the 'sections' are preachy, most of the insights are unoriginal, and there are a few things which are patently offensive. For example, in one passage, ""The Vocabularies of Science"", Hubbard calls Japanese a ""baby talk language"" and proceeds to espouse his almost complete ignorance of the language. I find it difficult to believe the CofS includes that in their translations for prospective Japanese scientologists. On the other hand, if you think Japanese is a baby talk language, and also believe some of the other bizarre assertions in this book, maybe scientology is for you... In sum, I cannot fathom why any thinking person would join the CofS as a result of reading this book. Lousy, preachy, ignorant, and boring. To put it bluntly, a complete waste of money."
2,"Good photography, annoying narration and distractions","For those of you looking for something in the mold of Planet Earth, Life of Mammals, and Life in the Freezer, you are going to be deeply disappointed. The first 20 minutes of the feature is a lecture on global warming, with excessive amounts of coverage of humans studying the arctic ice. The second half actually features ""the Masters of the Arctic Ice"", but the narration seems more interested in rambling about climate change than actually providing insight as to what is occurring with the animals. If you are a fan of stern global warming lectures, you will love this. If you actually wanted to learn about the animals, there are easily a dozen better DVDs you should view first.This is a true shame, as it has some of the best film yet of seal and polar bear dens. However, I can't tolerate political lectures when I merely want to study animal behavior and interaction."
2,Deceiving cover.,"I thought this would be an interesting show about polar bears, but it is a film about climate change. There is not that much discussion of polar bears."
3,Power Isometrics- The DVD Course,"I was expecting an exercise along with type video, this wasn't anything like it. Perhaps the book will be more explanatory. I think they should do more of an exercise with the people on the video type format instead."
3,Average Beenie. . .,"Beenie Man typically does his best work on his big albums, and Youth Quake is certainly not one of his big albums, but nevertheless its pretty good. It seems to be a very very low quality production, the cover and back pictures are very bad, and not only is the track listing on the back missing a track #6 put its also out of order.On the record itself, like I said, its pretty good , it has 2 tracks Mek Use a Life and Unu Fi Follow We that has Beenie recording when he was a young teenager, but you can see his skills on Mek Use a Life. Unu Fi Follow We is pretty bad. My favorite tracks are Selassie, Study Me and Badder Than Di Rest, the albums best song. He also has Leave Dem with Yellowman which is decent. If you have never bought a Beenie Man album then don't start with Youth Quake, but if course if you are a fan then you'll have 3-4 good records that you've most likely never heard before here."
2,Is NOT an exact replacement,"I have a Compaq EVO N610C and I was looking for a replacement AC Adapter to work in Caracas, Venezuela. This adapter works fine and charge battery, but I took out three stars because it is rated 18V & 2.5 Amp = 45W and seller did not show this technical information in big letters. It is not the exact replacement for original 65W charger, rated 18V & 3.6 Amp from Compaq."
5,TREMENDOUS MONEY SAVER,"Adapter was delivered expediently, was brand new, and worked as good as the original name brand. Paid $8.00 instead of the name brand price of $80.00. Couldn't be happier!"
1,Item didn't work,The 1st cord that was sent was broken. They sent me another one immediately w/out me having to return the broken one. The 2nd one they sent wouldn't power the laptop and after looking it was not on the list for replacement cords for the laptop. This cord has been sent back to them today at my cost. I am awaiting a credit.
1,POWER CORD STOPPED WORKING WITHIN 6 MONTHS,"I purchased this DEKCELL laptop power cord on March 11, 2010. In August 2010, it began working intermittently. It's now September 3 and the cord doesn't work at all! This is a VERY POORLY MADE product and a WASTE OF MONEY."
1,Totally wrong item sent,"I was sent the totally wrong charger then the one pictured, and in the description. I was very careful to find the right size charger and checked all the codes multiple times before ordering."
4,Great value with a Fast Ship,"The problem with this type of adapter is the plug. They simply wear out, letting you think that your computer is about to crash. Unfortunately you have to replace the whole adapter, and can't just change out the plug. This is a great replacement at a good price, plus a fast ship."
2,too much trouble assembling,"I got this bike about a month ago and it is still not 100% assembled. I'm still having troubles aligning the rear water guards correctly and the front one I don't even know how to put it on. The pictures and instructions in the brocher are horrendous. The assembling is best done by a bike shop, unless you're a seasoned veteran. Buy it locally and save your self some headache."
4,Invicta Watch,"This is a nice looking watch, but it is gaining time. It's been worn now for a few months and is still not perfectly accurate. I am looking into the warranty. The pen is a nice addition."
3,Mostly geranium oil,"This didn't smell as good as I had hoped it would. It is a strong geranium oil scent which is fine with me as I love geranium essential oil. However I couldn't smell much else. There is a slight sour note in this mixed with the geranium. I wouldn't buy this one again although I do like this company's oils. I will be using this, as it is mostly pleasant, just not as great as I had hoped it would be. It is a bit of a camphor scent, or citronella, and is very pungent. I can't pick out any lavander or fir notes at all.I put two drops on my hand when I opened this in a dentist's waiting room and the assistant said to me I smelled like I had been at the spa. She didn't know I had put it on my hand but for two drops to allow others to smell it, it must be strong. And it does indeed smell like some spas, so that is a good thing. I am hoping it will grow on me as I get used to it.It took three weeks to arrive from the company."
3,Moderation is Key,"A very strong essential oil that packs punch. Although the aroma is pleasant enough, but use only few drops to avoid over saturating your room. When this product first arrived I filled a aroma diffuser with about 10 drops and got a terrible headache from the lingering aroma."
2,"Nice smell, fades too quickly","The perfume has a nice floral scent. I had received it in a large sampler selection and I was pretty excited about this one. The smell, however, wears off almost completely in an hour or so. It was something of a disappointment. The rating of the perfume isn't for its smell, but because it can't stay on long enough!"
1,Shipped wrong item and wouldnt respond to my requests,As I am not the only one that recieved Addict when I ordered Addict 2 for my wife. You would think that Sephora would look into the problem to see where the disconnect is! They never responded to either of my attempts to rectify the issue.Thankfully Amazon takes care of their customers via A-Z guarantee.Thanks Amazon!
5,Perfect Replacement.,"This AC Adapter is identical in every detail to the adapter that came with my Dell. It works perfectly with no problems at all. I am very satisfied with this product.AC Adapter for Dell PA-15, D2746, ADP-150EB"
2,will stop working,"It worked for about 3 months and then died on me yesterday. Its cheap, light and not of good quality. Don't waste your money, buy the original."
4,Am I the only person that likes this one?,"Lots of fun, I enjoy all of Joan's music, but this one is interesting, ""jazzed up Joan"". The album cover tells you alot about the time this was recorded, and really the kind of music you will hear. Kind of hokey, but enjoyable."
2,Out of date in body mechanics/transfers/safety,"As a nursing instructor working closely with rehab we found this book out of date, with no changes in transfers, body mechanics that have been updated for safety throughout the years. The demos show transfers with staff using poor body mechanics, leaning over residents, not using lower legs using lower back muscles. Moving a person to the side of the bed technique demonstratess segmental movement taking the resident out of body alignment. There are up to date techniques for this. Mercury thermometers are no longer used. A two person transfer to the wheelchair in this book involves picking up the resident from the back and lifting with someone in the front with the legs. if a resident needs this then a hoyer a must. For back safety! The Essentials of Nursing Assistants by Mosby Second Edition, includes the same outdated pictures and demonstrations."
4,Actress Victoria Main,"Victoria Main's hysterical portrayal of the character Val, makes this pseudo-documentary worth the purchase price."
3,Great title.,"The author is laso a great speaker, much better at speaking than writing. The anecdotes are superficial as the book is a compilation of presentation slides written in an afternoon."
3,Based on Japanese version.,"Having only played the Japanese version of this I think I lost something in not understanding the dialog but Im told it's rather humorous. It's originality is definitely the best the title has going for it, and while odd makes for a very fun game.Except it's short...real short. I recommend renting it first. There is definitely re-playability but only if your not easily distracted by other games like I am."
3,Good for a quick laugh,"This game is one of the most original concepts for a game that I have seen. However, it is extremely short. My friends and I rented a copy because we all wanted to try it... we beat it in a night. We had a good time playing it and making jokes about the ""plot"". But we were all let down by how quickly the last level came.We all agreed it was a decent game... just short. I wouldn't pay too much for this game. Wait around and buy it used for around $..."
2,Forgettable Experience,"I rented this game a while back because of it's innovative idea. Control a mosquito, suck blood from members of a family of three, and stay alive through the summer.Each level has you in a room with one member of the family, and has selected certain parts of their body for you to get a select amount of blood from. You have to be careful not to be spotted, or they'll swat you and strike you dead. Also, many of the levels feature obstacles like mosquito repellant and candles you have to watch out for.But the problem is, that's the entire game. About twelve levels like this, (some of which will take many tries) that will only last you about two or three days at most.The graphics are poor, the execution is strictly alright, so all in all, this game is nothing more than an interesting concept. Not really even worth a look, even for fans of weird games."
5,love it,"i got into BoC about three years ago, and my listening habits have never quite been the same. BoC has this insane way of making one addicted to their sound...to their vibe. Twoism is the latest addition to my BoC catalogue...i now have all albums by this wonderful duo out of Scotland. Twoism is very complex, yet very simple. it does sound like an early release, but don't let that fool you. Twoism carries quite a dark underlying tone...the second track, Oirectine, is my favorite. the whole album is phenomenal....if you like BoC at all, you owe it to yourself to get this collection of music. put on some headphones, play track two, close your eyes, and drift...peace,cic"
5,Classic Boards,"This is a classic. Everything before this album by BoC, you can not get, from catalog 3 - boc maxima, and if so? Only MP3's, and good luck with those! This is where you need to start out! If you wanna know who BoC is? Listen to this first then go get Music Has The Right To Children and Geogaddi, come back to get Hi Scores then everything else. This is a really classic album with great synth lines. Tape tracking on the synths/organs adds a 1970's/80's PBS feel to it, just like the rest of the albums they have. Great Stuff!"
3,Purchased by Mistake,I was looking for a photography book - 28MM - and ordered this product by mistake. It looked like an interesting model but not what I wanted.
3,For my husband,"This was a gift for my husband. It took awhile to put together though. There were no instructions, so it was mostly guessing. Some of the pieces had to be shaved down to fit together though. I won't be purchasing another one."
2,feh,If you read the other reviews you'll see this album and band compared to various other bands and songwriters and it gets loaded with all the lazy journalism jargon(freak folk and psych-Americana). It is pretty derivative but not in the way that Devendra Banhardt is. At least his records are fun to listen to. This is a pretty average indie rock album and a fairly weak psych/folk/whatever album.
1,"No fun, annoying, ambient, spaced out nonsense.","Akron/Family opens up with Kansas like licks and it only gets worse from there. The spaced out noisy, ambient jams are boring as all hell, the ideas and lyrics are strictly second rate (check out titles such as ""Suchness"" and ""Interlude Ak Ak was the Boat They Sailed In On"") and the whole package is exactly the opposite of what these fellows claim they ain't sellin' (hipster, indie style, weirdo pop).It's weary and obtuse but not in the way Bonnie Price Billy is. Pass on this one."
4,failed Utopians,"This novel is a very quiet, fictionalized exploration of four young women who surrounded English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley: his first, abandoned wife Harriet Westbrook, his second wife, Mary Shelley, who became the author of Frankenstein; her step-sister and Byron's lover, Clare Clairmont, and their half-sister Fanny Wollstonecraft. The story of one year in the lives of Shelley and his circle is told through letters and diaries of the four women, who are very different personalities: the self-centered Clare, the somewhat ruthless Mary, the pathetic Harriet and the completely tragic Fanny. At the end of a year death and disillusionment will have touched them all, but the book is not primarily melancholy. It's like opening a window into 1816 and seeing how these young people, who intended to change the world, struggled with the demands of high ideals vs daily reality."
4,Great Historical Fiction,"I really enjoyed this book. I literally couldn't put this book down!This book focuses on the Thomas family during the 1960's and 1970's. I thought that it was a great historical-fiction novel, because I learned a lot about the time period. (If you haven't read the previous books in the series, then the book won't make much sense.)This book has a very interesting plot. There are many things going on at the same time, through different characters. There is a character that is actually in the war, one in Germany, one in the Peace Corps, and one in Utah. I love how the book presented the time period through many different angles and points of view."
4,'Take Me Home' a page turner.,this exciting historical book recapes the history of the vietnam war through an LDS family. It takes you to the forests of Vietnam as you sit on the edge of the seat anticipating the next page. It takes you into the lives of an abusive relationship and how she survives. You also see through the eyes of the Peace Corps in the philippeans and there frustrations and happiness. I would recomend this book to everyone who is curious about the Vietnam war and loves adventure.
5,The BEST guidebook for SE Asia,"This guidebook is indispensable. It's easy to use once you figure out the map key, lightweight, and had tons of very accurate useful information. I loved it!! I ended up having the most reliable guidebook of anyone else I met."
3,Did not include in my order???,I am giving them a 3 star because they did not ship 1 out of 3 items. I ordered 3 different teas from Adagio and they only shipped 2. There was no notice that it was excluded on site or in packaging. I am still giving a 3 because I was not charged for the excluded item. The teas I did receive the Rooibos-Orange was really good and had lots of flavor. The Almond teas was a little disappointing due to flavor of the tea and hints of Almond were very week even after a long steep time.
3,not as dark as I thought,Felt it did not cover the leather properly. Color should have been deeper. Product was almost like a neutral color
5,I LOVE THIS PEN!,"I love the color pink and so does my friend who has weak hand grip, so I try to find pens that write smooth but easily without needing to use much pressure. This one is perfect for that. It writes very smooth but doesn't flood out ink.The only thing that I wished, was that the pink color was a little darker but it's still a nice color."
2,"shipment is ok,but the camera is far from what I expected.","I just got the camera. I'd say the price and shipment is satisfactory.But the worse thing is that on the first page for this item on amazon.com,it said ""2 AA batteries required(included)"".But actaully,I found it uses CR2 3V Lithium battery. The other bad thing is that the rectangular viewfinder is totally offseted(not centered) in the viewfinder window, which means I can only see the above two angles of the rectangular viewfinder and the circle(I don't know how to call that) which is supposed to be in the middle is in the southeast. This totally upsets me.I am wondering whether this means bad quality or something.I need to check or maybe someone could give me some suggestions."
1,Disgusting,"I absolutely love Walt Disney World, I go every year, and I especially appreciate Walt himself. But what I will not take is the form of animal abuse that was put into this movie. What people don't know is that Disney paid kids in Churchill, Manitoba, to catch lemmings, then transported them to non-habitat in Alberta where a turntable flung them off a cliff and into ""the sea"" by the dozens. See for yourself: [...]"
3,Sophia Luminous in sweet romance,"Aah Sophia... one of the greatest beauties of our time, and talented too, loved her singing and dancing in this sweet little romantic comedy set in beautiful Naples and the Isle of Capri. The plot concerns Gable arriving in Naples to sort out his late brother's affairs and bumping into a little boy who turns out to be his nephew...and is now being raised by his Aunt Loren. Gable wants to take the boy back to USA as he dissaproves of the care free way in which he is being raised...after initially fighting Gable and Loren fall in love and alls well that ends well. Its lighthearted and fun and good to watch Sophia Loren at the beginning or her remarkable career and Gable towards the end of his."
3,"i love the scenery,music, and the actors!","one of my all-time-favorites. sophia loren and clark gable are fun to watch, and the little boy steals the show. the music and gorgeous capri and naples stayed with me."
1,Painful,"That's the best way I can describe watching this movie and the characters, from Gable to the ""cute"" little boy. Didn't make it all the way through. Thankfully I only rented and didn't buy."
3,It Started In Naples,"I have seen this movie time and time again over the years and it always still leaves me with sigh! The scenery, songs, actors, and the inevitable love story are both beautiful and timeless. I have always enjoyed movies with Sophia Loren and Clark Gable and this one is among my favorites. Comic one-liners, mixed with song and dance on the beautiful island of Capri. How can two people not find love! Pop some popcorn, get comfortable on your sofa and settle down with this movie. I'm sure you will not be disappointed."
1,What a scam,I ordered this DVD and had it shipped to North Carolina. It did not play on my DVD player and when I contacted the company they said it was my responsibility to check and see if it's compatible in the US or just in Europe. They also said that I had to pay for shipping to return it and they would deduct their shipping costs from my refund. A $13 DVD would have ended up costing over $30 to exchange it for the correct one. This is a scam and bad business.
3,Wrong format,"It was in a foreign format couldn't watch it on our DVD player,didn't state that it was in a different format."
1,dissapointment,was really looking forward to watching this - when it arrived it was a 'region restricted' version! I'll be more careful in the future
1,No more Amazon Purchases for me.,"The ""It Started in Naples"" DVD was formatted for Region 4 players and will not play on American DVD players which are Region One formatted. I could not get a return authorization from the seller."
4,Very good overview of the MoMA exhibition,"Having just taken in the MoMA show, I was very satisfied with the Pollock catalog. Very nice job reproducing the works (a difficult task in the printing of art catalogs!) Many fold-outs assist in conveying the size of Pollock's larger works. Large, full-bleed detail shots add a nice touch, complimenting the entire painting. While I'm not thrilled with the cover design, the interior is well-written, well-presented, and well-worth reading."
3,very concise,its a bit small for the price but the prints are very accurately rendered and the descriptions of each work are perceptive and precise in terms of form and style.
1,Very dissapointed,"Book was small with very few color plates. Highly disappointing. Although it was new, it seemed very unprofessional in the way it is published. Almost like a homemade book"
5,"Pollock, only Pollock, nothing else but Pollock","This is the catalogue for the landmark Pollock exhibition held at the Moma and the Tate in 1998-1999. Considering the steep rise in the insurance value of Pollock's paintings, such a comprehensive retrospective is not likely to be repeated in the near future and we are therefore fortunate to have such a brilliant book to help us remember it. The late Kirk Varnedoe was one of the best interpreters of contemporary American art and his text, never anecdotical and always informative without being pedantic, does justice to the masterpieces without falling into any of the cliches that often pollute our view of this great artist.Beautiful illustrations make this book an indispensable presence in any arts library."
5,Sunpack UV Ultra Violet Filter for 62mm lens,I rec'd the lens and have been using it ever since. I was told by a college professor who teaches us digital photography that this was a must. It will protect your actual lens and enhance our pictures. I feel it is doing both!
2,Inexpensive but not good,"This filter was bought basically to protect my camera lens from the elements and fingers. However, the reflections from this filter create big problems when there are small sources of light in the picture to be photographed. A good filter should be coated with an anti-reflection film."
4,sunpak,the product works great and does just what it is attended to do it also helps protect the glass in my lens from damage.
5,Excellent Filter,"Purchased this filter along with a CPL for a new Tamron lens. Product arrived very promptly (a day after the lens), and does exactly what it is supposed to do. Cuts through blue haze nicely, and protects the lens at the same time. Highly recommended."
4,Perfectly fine filter,I purchased a Sigma 30mm f/1.4 and got this as protection for the glass. The construction is well above average and it seems to be a very well made filter.
1,The item might be good... but not this supplier.,"I ordered this item from ANTOnline and 5 days later I received an e-mail stating: ""Unfortunately, we are unable to deliver to the address entered at order placement, and we have instructed Amazon to cancel your order""... 5 days later! This is the first time in the many years since I started buying from Amazon and its suppliers that I get an apology of this kind. But more interestingly, the order just disappeared from my purchase records at Amazon so at this moment I am not able to leave a feedback using the standard procedures. I already filed a complaint stating this problem to both Amazon and ANTOnine but still want to advise other potential customers to stay away from this product or get it from another supplier."
5,Solid Filter,"Great filter, solid build, I am happy with Sunpak and will continue to purchase future filters from them. Don't have any other brand so can't really compare them, but from some of the other reviews read about others I can't see them being better than this-good glass, solid metals and good tolerances on the build."
3,great lens but unstable.,"I purchased this lens for my Sony DSC H20b. It's a great buy and works well, but the lens is unstable. It mounts perfect on my telephoto/wide angle, and lens adapter, but if you pull on it slightly it comes off. I'm not sure if this filter will secure better on other model cameras, but would hate to see someone drop and break an expensive lens for not having the filter mounted tightly."
2,Collecting dust in my camera bag,I don't like the look of the photos with this filter. I bought a Marumi instead and the difference in quality is astounding. I wish I never bought the Sunpak.
2,That's Why It is Cheap,"It's cheap for two things:1. A good filter would only block the polarized light, reduce the reflection. This cheap filter has its side effects by shifting the color cast to blue at maximum point and then to greenish when rotated for another 180 degrees.2. A good filter would almost completely block out polarized light at maximum. You can test it in front of a bright LCD monitor and at maximum, a good CPL filter will go completely dark. This cheap filter will only block half; you can still see what's on the LCD screen (and like mentioned above, it's blue tinted too)."
5,"Great, inexpensive filter","I've been using this for over 2 years now, and it has worked out well on my Canon PowerShot G11. My only issue would be that the threads are a little finicky, but I couldn't tell you if that was because of the filter or the lens adapter that I use. Either way, for under $4, it's well worth it."
3,Meh...,"I'm shooting on a Nikon D3000When i first put the polarizer on, i could notice a difference with the blue of the sky being more vivid.All in all, the colors were undisturbed with the brightness of the sun.BUT when i used it indoors, i saw no difference with the elimination of reflections :/ and i'm guessing that means that i won't be able to see through water (like to photograph a fish from above in shallow water..or something)...so it was a bit of a disappointment..but then again.. you get what you pay for!i think i'm going to return it :/if you have the money, definitely don't get this one.but if you just want a cheap lens to make your outdoor colors a little better, then i do recommend you try this out."
5,Nice polarizer,"Does what it is supposed to. I know the pros out there will probably say you need to spend $150 on a CP, but for us amateurs/hobbyists this filter works just fine. The threads are really small, but they have to be to match the lens designs... so thats not really something that any filter can fix. Screws on easily, and turns easy enough without feeling sloppy. Stays where its put. Comes in a nice little holder that I still use in my camera bag to keep off the dust.Ive used it several times at the beach and in the blue ridge mountains with fine results, but there is a learning curve to it. There is a CP filter effect where one side of the picture is darker than others, if you dont watch where you have the sun. Dont blame it on the filter... its the camera person in most cases."
5,Wow!!!,"I just finished reading Soul Searcher, the Reckoning and can honestly say, Mr. Arend hit a home run with this book! Wonderful plot, story and characters."
2,Not terrible but of a typical type,"The poor, the downtrodden, the huddled masses... find your compassion, chuck in a few laughs, and it's off to the races as you watch dysfunctional lives try to become whole. It's well-written, funny and the characters are endearing, but I've now seen so many stories constructed along this line, I want to put up a billboard outside Schaffert's house: ""Yes, We Know, Already."" My soul wasn't changed by this book, and while it's not a terrible read, it's not one I'm compelled to recommend either."
2,Slow and uninteresting,Starts out slow and stays slow. Scripting and directing is poor and characters are not developed. The are screens that you wonder how does this fit into the picture. Save your money.
1,WWII Movie,"Poorly directed Movie. Boring, at times I didn't know if I was looking at comedy, or a dark comedy, or why this film was searching for a reason to be serious."
4,Danish Resistance,"This is an interesting take on the Danish Resitance Movement in WW II and is well-researched. It is not one of the most exciting accounts of this heroic struggle, but it accurately contributes to the written history as most of the active participants have passed away."
3,An odd record,"Even if there always is nice to hear Tosca with Callas, I was a little disappointed when this CD arrived. First the title: ""My first Tosca"". Her first Tosca was not 1950 in Mexico City, but 1942 in Athens during the war. Inside, in the very little textbook the editor explains that this is Callas's first Tosca on an ordinary stage, the 1942 performances was given at an outdoor arena. VERY far-fetched I must say. The other disappointment is the spare textbook in the box, with very few, very small pictures of the jewelry mentioned. Only the most fanatic Callasians must buy this CD. I am one of them."
1,Disc would not play in PS2. So unfortunately is great game I've played before but does not work so can't play.,"Disc would not work in machine. Have played this game before , it's great but disc did not work. Just warning you it may not work for you as well."
2,Lacked the Zip and Wit ...,"...of the first two books in the series. It felt in ""Mistress of Scandal"" that Sara Bennett was forcing chemistry, forcing tension, and forcing the narrative along. While the book was not completely lacking, it really was a hohum text that offers no real wit or sparks. A blah book all around."
4,3rd book in the Greentree Sisters series,"Mistress of Scandal, the third book in the Greentree Sisters series. The infamous courtesan, Aphrodite has three daughter by three different men. They get kidnapped as children and she get reunited with his daughter as the series goes along. This is the story of Francesca, the third daughter who dislikes her mother because she is scared she will become like her mother. He mother hires Mr. Thorne to solve the mystery of the people who stole her daughter. The mystery leads to Francesca dangerous moors and start a great mystery and romance. Check out the other books of the Greentree Sisters series; Lessons in Seduction, and Rules of Passion."
4,"It is what it is, and there is nothing wrong with that","I'll keep this review simple (and delicious). Like another reviewer said, it's pretty much all recipes and very little of anything else. You get the occasional kitchen shortcut, product comparison and article but nowhere near what Taste of Home or other cooking magazines offer. Is that a bad thing? Well it depends on what you're looking for. I subscribed because I wanted simple recipes I could make during the weeknight and not spend a lot of money. That's exactly what S&D delivers. As for the recipes themselves most of them are hits with only a few so far being near misses. Out of the three Taste of Home magazines, (Taste of Home and Healthy Cooking being the other two) this one is my favorite and the only one I subscribe to. If you're looking for an upgrade of this type of magazine then I would recommend Cook's Country."
2,Hard to follow...,"Personally, as an undergraduate, I do not like this book at all... It leaves a lot of important proofs to the reader which is not helpful when first learning Abstract. Plus definitions and concepts are not clearly states, a lot is ""assumed."" All in all, I would go for another book, or at least two supplements..."
5,An Internet Guide For Everyone,"This book has an approachable, plain English writing style geared to anyone interested in Internet publicity (not just the big corporations). The author includes lots of helpful examples to illustrate his points. Seeing how the pointers, tips, and procedures operate in the real world enables anyone to apply them to his or her business. I already have!"
3,"Not ""best practices"" and not always accurate","I wanted to like this book. But I was taken aback by the author's attitude toward email campaigns - he says you'll never get anywhere if you don't use opt-out marketing to build a list. People will complain, but you can find an ISP that ignores their complaints. I was also surprised to find him radically misinformed about search engine traffic. Most people who have a web site in a specialized niche find search engines bring them lots and lots of beautifully targeted visitors, but he says that only sites with megabudgets get search engine traffic. His discussion of meta tags is out of date as well. He has some good ideas, but I hope people don't take him as an authority."
5,IMHO The best Role Playing Game Ever,"If you have ever dreamt of becoming one of Roger Zelazny's AmberPrince, then buy this call some of your friends and have fun.This is, I think, the first Diceless RP-System and I can tell youthat it really works...By the way, if you want to get opinions from people using theGame : subscribe to the Amber mailing list: a high bandwithmailing list dedicated to the Amber Diceless Role-Playing andRoger Zelazny's Amber (send an e-mail message to Majordomo@logrus.orgwith in the message body: subscribe amber <your e-mail @>)It's way too bad Roger Zelazny died on 14 June 1995... :-("
2,A decent reference but a poor RPG,"I first bought this several years ago and have used it off and on since then. It is full of reasonable reference material but it is very sloppy as far as Role-Playing Games go. First of all, dice are a game aid and so by not incorporating rules for determining questionable outcomes, the writer ""cops out"". Any RPG can be as diceless as the players want it to be. The game says that the player who stake a clain to a given specialty should be regarded as the best in that area, yet the existing NPCs(the original characters from the books) are far more powerful than the players can hope to be, even in a long period of play. I found the rules to be generally disorganized and contradictory. In any RPG the players often can feel free to disregard some rules that are inconvenient or tangent to the game tone. I suspect many people will be disregarding most of these rules."
2,Messy,"I got this bag at work, someone had ordered it as a replacement for our pastry bags used for whipped cream. This bag is very sturdy but it leaked all over my hands. My superior laughed at me when I told her that the thing was oozing out all over the place when she questioned me about wrapping it with a cloth. When I showed her the mess it made on your hands without the cloth, she was disgusted. I've never seen a pastry bag without a lining on the interior so this was really bizarre. Perhaps it is not meant for anything other than really stiff dough or piping cream puffs but for what we needed this bag for, it was worthless."
2,EPIC MESS,"I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought this product. It has very sturdy French seams and the bias-cut canvas can withstand all manner of treatments, but that's all this bag has going for it. I've used it for piping frostings and icings several times now, and everything leaks through the bag onto my hands, precluding a good grip and getting sugary grease on everything I touch (makes for an epic mess to clean up). Also, the bottom of the bag is just a wee bit too big to fit my standard couplers, so frosting leaks out between the bottom of the bag and the top of the piping tip. Another problem is the finished bottom seam, making the fabric there very thick. Even if it did fit standard couplers, the fabric there is too thick to properly screw on a coupler ring. Do yourself a favor and head straight for the plastic-coated pastry bags; don't buy this one!"
2,Not useful for rich doughs,"I bought the for spritz cookies. The dough is very rich, and butter was literally oozing out of he sides of the bag with each squeeze. I will buy a plastic or silicone-lined canvas bag to replace it."
5,black heart procession is good,"This music is good. I think that they have influnced many bands including, Modest Mouse, Pinback, and I think Radiohead. All of which Ive been in to for a long time. I look forward to picking up more Black Heart Procession releases. And thier drummer is good. Thank you,that is all."
3,Eased envelopment,"There aren't enough songs that really cut to the morbidly moody minimal core that makes the band breathe life into lifelessness, but the album's length of modestly well put together tracks ensures the release goes down smoothly."
5,Great album,"You can't deny the passion and integrity that spills from this album. Not only is it musically exceptional, but it possesses that raw sense of emotion that only comes through on smaller productions...the kind recorded not in a big studio but within the artists own means.I'm simply amazed having heard the evolution of this music, not just off previous albums... but in the unabashed setting of a small clubs.I wholly recommend this album, and any future or past albums that make their way to the public.Best Track: ""Find a Way"" - This track shows the breadth and span of Justin's voice. Great change-ups and lyrics.Other key tracks:- ""Bleed""- ""Fingertips""- ""Waitin' on you""Enjoy."
4,This book from 1970 was very close to the mark,"I recently reread this book which I had obtained and read years ago. The book was very close to the mark. I have read about the transitions in Poland. The Polish leaders went to Russia and were allowed to go back to Poland after giving only promises. I wondered why this happened, and Amalrik's book contains statements that show the situation and how it was changing at that time, 1970, before the later events.Reading the book as US and Russian supply planes were crossing the Mediterannean Sea in the 1973 October war, it was difficult to see what was coming. Andrei should commended for seeing much more than most."
4,Spider-Man 3: Sandman Bank Heist by Mega Brands,My son has enjoyed this toy and plays with almost every day. The Mega Blocks instructions are getting much better and we had no difficulty putting it together. I would recommend this toy.
1,Very disappointed,"My son was extremely excited to receive his lego in the mail as most 9 year-old boy's are. Upon opening it was very clear the box had been opened and re-taped. Not only were there building pieces missing but the people that were suppose to be included had been removed (right hand corner of box display window totally cut opened and taped back up). This was my first toy purchase from Amazon and will probably be my last if for no other reason than the fact that trying to explain to your child some people are not honest with the products they sell, just plain sucks.Sincerely,Sorry I took the chance"
4,More fun for Lego fans!,"My 6 year old nephew was excited to receive this for Christmas. He had never seen this toy and collects lots of spiderman things. I received it just 3 days after I ordered it online - hard to beat the price, especially w/free shipping!"
5,Love these socks!,"I love these socks! They're snug and comfortable! I love that they are breathable, and you don't have to worry about them falling down into your shoes when running. They are worth paying a bit extra for good quality socks!"
3,Fast delivery and decent quality,"The item was delivered within 10 days, and the quality was ok. The tape was perfect and the box was quite old and worn.."
5,One of my all time favorite CD's!,TRACK LISTING:1. Angel Street2. Touch Me3. Red Mask4. Kiss Me5. Dreamland6. Only With You7. Pee Wee8. Thrill Me9. Obsession
5,I Lo-o-o-ve This Water Kettle!!,"This is the second Otoni water kettle by Bodum I've owned in 25 years. The wood handle near the spout eventually disintergrated from exposure to steam, but the kettle is so beautiful I couldn't resist another go'round. Very glad to know that it is still being manufactured. What a relief!!"
1,Buy this for your enemies,"This is a horrible study guide. The practice questions are not even remotely the same as those that appear on the actual LSAT. Even worse, they are substantially easier than the real questions leaving you woefully unprepared when test day comes. If you know somebody who you would like to see fail the LSAT, by all means get them this book."
5,Nice Filter,"I have purchased two of these filters, one for theCanon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS SLR Lensand one for theCanon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras. Both filters are crystal clear and threaded onto the lens without difficulty. I haven't noticed any loss of image quality when using this filter, and to me the lens protection you get is well worth the modest price. If you have an L-series lens or other expensive glass you may want to look into buying a higher-end filter, but for the lenses I mentioned above I believe this one does a great job."
1,Picture Ruiner,"As single coated filters go, I suppose this one is OK. However, single coated filters will turn into glare city any time you are shooting in lower light where light sources are visible in your picture.With this filter (and single coated filters from other brands), you get green dots whenever you're out at dusk or at night and point the camera at anything involving a light source, such as a street lamp, a marquee, etc. On a recent trip to Disney World, this ruined so many otherwise perfect night shots.These things are not expensive. Do yourself a favor. Spend twice as much and get a Hoya or B+W filter instead. Make sure it's multi-coated. This way, when you point the camera at or around a light source at night, instead of green dots you will see no glare. Big difference!"
3,potentially ruins your photos,"i bought this for my kit lens on the rebel t2i for the 18-55mm 3.5-5.6. it works great, and i really just wanted it for protecting the glass from hitting it or dust. it worked well for that lensthen i upgraded to the 50mm 1.4 lens. this filter and the lens do not work together. if you are working in dark light(which is probably all the time with the 50mm 1.4) you will have problems with this filter. it reflects light, and sometimes even when the light is out of the frame. perhaps its the lens? i took the filter off and took the same photo and the reflection was gone. make sure you use a lens hood when using this filter or dont use it at all. i will show a pic of what reflections are appearing"
3,uv filter...,"Kind of useless as a UV filter, but great for lens protection. I would much rather pay five bucks for a new filter than 300 for a new lens. these get really dirty really fast, so keep a microfiber cloth and some cleaning solution handy or else you will have a lot of finger prints and smudges in your shots."
3,creates glare,"I bought these filters in order to protect the front of the lens, but light is trapped between the front glass and the filter which is causing glare when taking photos of sunrise/sunset and moon. I really dont see any difference in the shots with them on or off - but they are a cheap way to protect your lens if needed. I would say that these filters actually cause glare to occur - not prevent it."
2,"Junk, pretty much","I use my UV filter mostly to protect my camera lens. Well, this filter does that. It also scatters light across it, creating a blurry, poorly lit photo if you are anywhere near looking into the sun. Granted, taking a picure into the sun isn't a great idea, but sometimes that's the angle you've got and that's that. In that case, unscrew this filter because you're going to ruin your shot otherwise. Like another reviewer said, you get what you pay for. This is junk."
4,"Fine with camera, doesn't seem to play nice with other lenses.","On my cameras (including Canon S10) this works fine. Eliminates lens flaring (I don't notice any UV difference, sorry), doesn't seem to distort the image.But, when I add wide angle adapters or macros, it doesn't seem to mesh well. Weird shadows or fixed glares appear. Not sure why. But, for what it is, works fine. I mostly want it as a lens protector, frankly."
4,great product for the money,"I ordered two of these for the price. received them and couldn't be happier. I am a new ""photographer with DSLR and just wanted to protect my purchase until I know what i'm doing!"
1,Strange green glare of light sources at night.,"There's a horrible glare at night. I took pictures of the Eiffel Tower and was sad to see the Tower upside down and green next to the real thing in my images. Alas I'm no longer in Europe and I've done some side-by-side comparisons and it's definitely because of the filter. Spend a few bucks more and get a good filter. You're not just protecting your investment in lenses, but you'll get better pictures!"
2,Unacceptable Glare,Purchased several of these filters hoping to get something cheap to protect my lenses. I always heard about issues regarding glare but never particularly noticed. Realized after shooting a number of shots on vacation that the glare is a huge issue. Ruined a number of shots.These are fine if you want something to protect your lens while in a bag but after stepping up to a more expensive filter the difference was immediately apparent.The only way to give this product a good review is if you aren't ever shooting in an instance where there will be light.
5,There should be more books/annuals like this,"In the past, I always enjoyed the Bill James Baseball Abstract annuals. These days, in each of the three major sports, there are quality annuals that try to follow in James's path. Baseball Prospectus, Pro Football Prospectus and John Hollinger's Pro Basketball Forecast. These are all annuals that look at the game from an intelligent, statistical standpoint. It's not all numbers though - it's the numbers that he uses to tell the story of a team or player. Having read Hollinger's previous annuals, I'm getting used to his style and some of the stats that he came up with. He's not afraid to give an opinion, even a very negative one...and that is GREAT for the reader! I will continue to pick up his annuals before the start of every basketball season. Leave the annual basketball magazines alone, and pick up this one. It's more expensive but more than worth the price compared to those magazines."
5,Modquad,"ya ya another $75 spent on my endless money pit bansheeonloy downfall is no directions!!that is something most of us need as simple as they are to install its nice to not have to go on youtube or google pics to see which roller goes where or how the larger slider is mounted, anyhow i am not an idiot and neither are 90 percent of people who buy shit for their quads, but simple as that throw some directions in and i think you guys will continue to sell a good product every1 can be happy with"
3,"Decent, but Not Amazing","This book contains two novellas, so I'll talk about them separately:The titular story was my favorite of the two and centered around a young woman who got trapped underground where she adapted to her environment in order to survive. Although the ending was a bit anticlimactic, the various adjustments made by the lead were interesting to read.The second story, ""Beauty Is..."", was centered around a mentally disabled woman named Martha with a disfigured face. It alternates between her story and the story of her parents' marriage and life with Martha. This didn't do a whole lot for me, as the historical segments were fairly predictable, and the present story turned into one of those second-rate horror-thriller movies from the late '70s/early '80s.Not a bad read overall, but I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone, either."
2,No longer works,Unit worked well for about one year. It then failed and will no longer operate. cheap item! I cannot recommend!
5,Great Receipts,Received the order very quickly and the product is exactly as described. It's just as good as anything you would buy from a big box office supply and a great price. Don't hesitate to purchase.
5,I cried all the way through this book,I'm not healed yet. I need to find someone who can help. This book made me feel a little less alone with this problem.
3,can opener.,"Its not what I thought it be. It works fine. Its slow, and it requires some finagling to get it on the can."
3,hand held can opener,"Opener is a little awkward to use and operates quite slowly.It does open cans leaving no sharp edge on the lid. The edgeleft on the can is somewhat sharp and care needs to be takennot to get cut. It would be better if it had more power, suchas plugging into a house AC outlet."
5,Delightful Gift for the Avid Golfer,"Tom Edwards slim book is packed with whimsey and verse so charming that every golfer needs one in his bag. Clever drawings only amplify the twists of rhyme that lead one down the fairway between sand trap and trees. Fresh, quotable lines for venting the frustration only the game of golf can create. This book was more refreshing to read than eighteen holes on an empty green."
5,God's in the Details,"Mr. Armstrong's book is an introduction to the seedy/glamorous worlds of the Mob, casino gambling and direct mail marketing, with the Creator lurking in all the hidden places. Following a get-rich-quick system for Craps, our hero, a writer of junk mail, tangles with the mob and almost loses what's left of his soul. I had a wonderful time following these characters through an original plot and a real surprising and plausable ending. At the very least, it'll be great reading this summer on the beach at Atlantic City."
5,"New Winner, Coming Out!","As another person said, you don't have to shoot craps to appreciate this book because craps, here, is a symbol of the author's characters' hopes, fears and dreams in life.This is a wonderfully well written book as well as being a hoot, a load of laughs. The characters are all too real. Although they are ""Joisey"" (NJ) and Northeastern and some Vegas types, there are people like them all over the world, but with different accents. It was like hearing a very wise English professor hold court and expound about life and his trips to casinos. The book can be understood on many levels. It was like ""Casino"" meets ""The Gang Who Couln't Shoot (Craps) Straight.""You might get some pointers on craps, but you'll get more pointers on people and life - and enjoy yourself. More insightfull than all my college psychology profs. put together - and a lot more witty. Bet on this book. You can't lose."
2,"Fun Read for Pilots, Gamblers, Copywriters and New Jersey lovers","If you know anything about flying, gambling and New Jersey -- this book hits all these (with most of the facts right). It is a great read -- quick and fun. Of course I am biased, I'm a copywriter, fly in a Beech Debonair, live in New Jersey, and drink dry gin martinis with olives - no gambling though. The flying scenes meet with the approval of the pilots in the South Side Lounge at Kupper Airport. The gamblers I know aren't sure the system would work -- they are going to give it a try next trip to Atlantic City."
4,"Good, but I wouldn't share it with my Mother","God Doesn't Shoot Craps is well written, fast paced, and entertaining - and would rate 5 stars if the author had left out the parts that one reviewer called ""a bit crude."" The explicit sex added nothing to the story, just made it disgusting in spots. Guess I'm too old-fashioned for modern writing. That may be why I don't watch TV."
5,Wow!,I read God Doesn't Shoot Craps over the weekend and loved it. Couldn't put it down. Armstrong is a wonderful writer. Great characters. Great plot. An insider look at gambling and direct mail. Plus a spiritual component. Wow!
3,Mixed bag,"I wasn't sure what to expect with a title like that, yet billed as a ""divine comedy."" There's symbolism a-plenty, with the main character named Dante, and other characters with names like Pentangeli, Peccati, and Mortale. The novel is even divided into books named Inferno, Purgatory, and Paradise.Then I encountered the cursing, a bit of sex, and other parts that made it clear that this is no ""Christian fiction"" work.I alternated between enjoying the story and scratching my head over the allegorical aspects, searching to make sure I wasn't missing some deep theological or philosophical meaning.The information about craps was interesting, the scientific material thought-provoking, and I must admit, it held my attention to the end. But I still don't know how to classify it."
4,"Good story, great characters, excellent read",Picked this one up and was glad I did. Plot moved quickly and subject matter that can be difficult to explain was done well. Great characters without being stereotypes. Check it out.
3,Curious George,"My daughter is 5 years old and has more than 2 dozen computer educational games to choose from. She consistently comes back to curious george to play the dinasour phonics game and the alphabet window washing game. It's very good for the phonic games. She is already reading first reader books and yet this softwear is still challenging her. The game has 3 levels to choose from based on your childs knowledge. Most of her other games use the mouse exclusively, and it was a little confusing at first when some of the game required the arrow keys and space bar, but she had to learn about these sooner or later. After she mastered certain areas, the software seemed to lock her out of that portion, but it can be overidden in the level menu."
1,simply awful,What sounded like a great idea for a comic turned into the worst thing I have ever read. The reviews listed here must have been written by Mark Hamill's cousins because the book lacks any depth of character or plot with a story line that is as predictable as a childrens book. This is simply an awful attempt.
5,Life changer! I fully recommend 100%,"THis is the best of all thier books. THe details are just perfect for someone who is applying these changes to his life.I hope they release new books, with new and very detailed advice.I believe, the phase of convincing the people of harmful food habits, is way gone. We are at a phase, where we want to do something about it. Just give us the details how. The positive energy from this book is superb. THe effect it has had on my families life, and my peers is astounding. I highly recommend it."
5,The best thing for me and my family,"This book has brought a new way of living for my husband and I. I was having trouble with my pregnancy, but as soon as I started Fit for Life, my pregnancy has been great. I have so much energy and my husband can notice a big difference in the way he feels too. This book is worth reading. Just try it and you will be amazed at the results. I am!"
2,Read this before you decide...,"I got halfway through ""Fit Fot Life"" and was very impressed... I overlooked the things that didn't sound right, because I wanted to believe it all. While it may have some value, before you invest too much energy in it make sure you read the reviews by doctors at the ""health care reality check"" website. hcrc.org. They start ""This foolish diet book, which sold over one million copies, shows how a weight loss program founded on unscientific concepts can be a huge commercial success."" Amazon will be doing it's customers a great dis-service if it does not publish this as it took me a great deal of time to find a credible, qualified reference that reviewed the book properly."
3,A good follow up to fit for life but not as good.,"I began the fit for life series with this book and much of what it said I grew very excited about and purchased the fit for life and the princibles in that book changed my life. This book however covers the basic priciples in fit for life and then moves on to introduce other priciples to better our health over-all. Alot of these aren't always easy to implement. Like sleeping with an open window, great if your in California and a chilly night only requires an extra blanket in much colder climates I don't beleive waking with ice on your walls overly healthy, as happens to me! I also have a problem with no soap or toothpaste, maybe being clean within helps but we live in a polluted environment. The book can be very interesting though and I'm sure there are those who may benefit in it's message. The explanations of additives I found facinating. There are also recipes included in this book which are good. Just not as good as the first in my opinion."
1,never received the book,i have not yet received the book and i cannot accept it now..i will be returning it to the sender whenever i get it...will you please credit Mr. Wall for it.thank you
2,Out there - but some value,"I found this book to be way out-there. It is definitely NOT what every other diet book will tell you. It's kind of hippie-ish, love-child, utopia, weird. I was expecting NUTRITIONAL information - but all I got was ""everything natural."" Like don't shave your pits kind of stuff. I don't know, as a gen-Xer, I can't really buy into this. Like not using chemicals in my kitchen or bathroom for cleaning and ""fresh air"" is the only air freshener. It's just a little too rebellious for me. I like to be a balanced person -- this is a level of ""perfection"" or a ""set of rules"" that I could never attain or stick with."
1,"Long on rhetoric...short on facts, this book is mostly hype","I bought and read this book years ago. At the time, the Diamonds seemed to make a good case for their viewpoint. After researching their claims over the years, I have discovered that most of what they claim is pure fiction and has no basis in the real world. They seem to know enough about their subject to be dangerous but not enough to actually offer sound advice.Take what they say with a grain of salt and research their claims before putting any of it into practice."
4,Come tour the 4-corners states.,"It is getting too cold to do many of these, but I have started my planning.I live in one of the 4 corners states, but was not aware of several of the trips/tours detailed in this book. I like to go to Colorado for skiing in the winter and stream fishing in the summer. Several of the tours are centered in one of my favorite areas.Each set of day tours is centered around a ""base camp"". The author is big on campgrounds, but I will find an inexpensive motel to use as my ""base camp"". A group of day tours is connected by a ""trail"" that takes you to the next ""base camp"".Hopefully, I will be planning trips for years to come, based on the ideas presented in this book. Good riding!"
5,Motorcycle Journeys Through the Southwest,We took a three week motorcyle trip west in 2007. I would definately recommend.
4,Good travel book,"This book reads a lot like most travel books- it describes where to stay and eat, and what to do that's fun. Its description of the roads and traffic could be enhanced.I have found it helpful in planning some trips into the area, although it suggest that I take a lot longer to visit everything than I have- a lot longer.All in all, I'm glad I bought it and have found it useful."
3,OK reference,"OK reference, but don't use it exclusively. I have several books I consult when planning a ride. This book will give you several tid bits, but I could have written a better book on my own."
1,Not much life at a new unbelievable price!,"Item seems to work for a few hours at night on days that are clear, although more than one day of cloud cover and nothing. Rechargable batteries and/or solar cells are at best, minimal quality.I purchased this item for $11.99 in June 2006 and now Amazon shows it at $27.96. Other retailers have it half that.....beware! Customer service would not check for an error."
1,Almost Totally Worthless,"I paid $2.92 with free Amazon shipping ... IT WASN'T EVEN WORTH $2.92 (it was an outlet clearance price at few weeks ago).I live in Los Angeles and it is still summer, yet after a day of charging in the So Cal sun, the very very minimal and dim light only lasts a couple hours once it automatically turns on at dusk. By NIGHT ... it is already off/out of charge.Don't bother."
3,Liberal Humor,"Creative captions, many are funny. Good at a used price of 01. cent, to keep in a waiting room lobby - some pages could be offensive."
3,Vignettes on my lens,"This filter has thick edges and can cause Vignetting, otherwise a nice filter. Used on my Konica-Minolta A-5 point and shoot."
2,Weak performer,"The swivel base on this vise may seem like it would be a useful feature, but in fact it renders the vise useless for clamping anything that you need to apply any torque to. The locking lever simply screws a threaded pin down onto a smooth bottom plate, providing a weak friction fitting that slips easily. You would think the locking pin would fit into a set of holes or slots (seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?). You'd be wrong. I had a project to complete, so, rather than returning this vise and buying a better one, I modified it by drilling a hole partway through the bottom plate and was able to get the job done. But I shouldn't have had to do that.Other than that, it's a pretty hefty little vise for the money---too bad it's spoiled by such a simple design flaw. The manufacturer says it's portable and compact, which it is (watch the grease, though), and that it's for ""light work."" Emphasize ""light."""
3,"Great camera, minor flaws","This camera has been awesome, and provides all the benefits that the literature boasts. The things I don't like:1. Boot up time2. Time between shots (with flash, or if you use the burst mode). There have been times when I've had to wait 30-40 seconds, to take my second shot of 3 bursts.3. Autofocus. If you really want a quick shot, and point and shoot it, even though the subject is right in front of your camera it is too quick to take the snap and your subject could be out of focus.The last one is a killer for me, and I'm surprised others haven't mentioned this."
5,A great compact digital camera with reasonable price...,"I bought it as a sub digital camera. I have a fuji S7000.-Low lighting condition: it is much better than any others-Picture quality: Very good or equal to S7000 with 6M*** setting-Easy of use: Yes, it is very easy and support 11 languages-Size: small enough and solid construction-Red eye: it works as it described. Although, it is ""post-processing"" and takes 1-3 seconds per picture.-Battery life: good enough to take 150 pictures-LCD: 1.8"" with 120K pixels. Very clear than low resolution 2.0"" or 2.5"".Not like:Re-charging flash or saving picture take longer than S7000. I'm not sure it is because of compact camera. Depended on picture quality setting, it takes 2 - 5 seconds."
1,Screen problem,I purchased two of these Cameras at Christmas 2005. By May one of the Screens stopped working. By July the second camera's screen stopped working. I don't know what the problem is. We love the pictures it takes and its ease but are unhappy about the screen problem.
1,"GREAT CAMERA, ...TERRIBLE COMPANY SUPPORT!","HP designers manufacture some fantastic products!!! However, once the warranty expires...you are on your own! They only give lip-service to customer service....even with simple repairs they will high pressure you to buy a ""upgrade"" or replacement. Take it from a former HP fan....look somerwhere else unless you can buy a lifetime extended warrantee."
3,Won't buy HP again!!!!!,"Bought an HP Photosmart R717 in the summer of 2005 for $324.74. 4 months after the camera warranty was up and after minimal usage the camera was displaying: 0000000F-10FB-1BD-024 Error Message, on the display screen.When I called HP about getting my camera repaired I was told that it would be too expensive to repair. I was informed it would cost around $200.00 dollars to receive most likely a refurbished replacement camera, with only a 3-month warranty.After trying the replacement camera for 15 days I was then to send my old camera back as partial payment for the replacement camera.I told HP no thanks, because they had already gotten enough money from me."
1,R717 Camera a Replacement for R707,"The reason I purchased this camera is that I already owned an HP R707 camera. The On/Off switch broke on the R707 and that left me with a lot of useless accessories. It was cheaper to purchase the R717 at Amazon than to have HP repair the R707. The pictures have been good so far, however I keep looking for the On/Off switch to break on this camera. If that happens I will buy something else."
1,This got PUBLISHED?,"Oy.I like the idea of making accessible stories for kids who aren't big readers, but why can't the stories be good? Sports stories are a good hook for students who are more into athleticism than reading, but if the stories suck this bad, I'm afraid that no one's being helped here.The stories are so bad that I won't rehash them. Just take my word for it, they are awful. By all means, find some good sports stories if that's what it takes to get your kid to crack a book, but stay away from this one."
4,Excellent Broadway!,"This great CD is a potpourri of new recordings of ""Mostly Mercer,"" Johnny Mercer, that is. The songs are by Broadway and jazz ladies, including Rosemary Clooney, Anita O'Day, Eydie Gorme, Kaye Ballard and others. I't a great collection, excellent sound quality, and everybody is in good voice. The most unusual number is by Judy Garland (aka female impersonator Jim Bailey) singing a song Judy never really sang--OUT OF THIS WORLD--but you would swear the legendary singer was still alive and kicking! Recommended!"
4,"Annoying, but Fun","We bought this for our toddler; she loves the chicken dance and the Elmo version just wasn't doing it for her. Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for such a young child, it is funny. The mechanism that makes him dance is pretty sensitive, so he ""goes off"" sometimes when we just barely touch him. The squawking can get a little annoying, but for an adult or older child, this chicken is hilarious!"
5,Verrrrry cute!!!,"Item is verrrry cute. My usually unimpressed friend was checking out another friend's chicken, just laughing at the looks of it and totally cracked up when he grabbed it's neck and it squawked, so he got one as a gift!"
1,Cruelty to animals,"This is a very disturbing product which should be removed from Amazon's catalogue. It encourages adults and children to injure and kill chickens, while laughing at the results. In light of the July 1, 2009 conviction of a Virginia poultry slaughterhouse worker for cruelty to farmed birds, this ""toy"" and its description as entertainment, is both violent and cruel. It is certainly not funny or enjoyable."
5,If you don't laugh there's something wrong with you.,"I purchased one of these for work, I'm a Recreation Therapist, the guys laughed so hard they almost fell out. I used it in a hangman game and when the chicken chokes and walks off doing the chicken dance you have to laugh."
5,great item,"We have had more fun with this chicken, the grand children love to watch it dance around and laugh and laugh"
2,"Very, Very funny, once you get it to work","My wife who used to work in a toy store had to really work hard with the battery compartment and batteries to get this toy to power up; however, once we got it working it was great. It was a surprise gift for my boss and he got the greatest kick out of it. all of other fellow coworkers were in stitches when the crazy, clucking, wacky chicken went into it's act, and boy did it squawk when you pull its neck. Again, a little maintenance on the front end but a most enjoyable and funny gift."
1,Not good quality!,Within one month of use these sheets began to pill and look shabby. They are no longer smooth and are no where near 'supreme' or 'elegant' I am very disappointed with them.
4,Great memories,This CD brought back great memories. I can listen to it over and over and never get tired of it.
4,Rainbow Fish to the Rescue ~ Marcus Pfister,"This is a good childrens book on teaching kids how to behave. Children do not know how to behave properly. But when you tell them through books, and use characters like Rainbow Fish, then it is easier for them to understand. It is a great book for kidst o read to understand how to expect peoples differences. Everyone is different in their own ways, it is just harder for some people to realize it. Everyone has their own special qualities, people just need to learn that we are all different.I like this book because things like this hapen in everyday life. Rainbow Fish is a good example of how people follow others, and do not think for themselves. When one other the other fish is not excepted becasue he is a little different, Rainbow Fish doesn't know how to react. But, he learns to stand up for himself and learns how to treat others. I think everyone should learn to try to except everyone. We are all same, yet we are all different."
2,Jim and Artie Deserved Better,"""More Wild Wild West"" (1980) lacked the unique qualities that made the TV series so memorable. Spoofing this classic adventure show was a big mistake, which director Burt Kennedy never seemed to grasp. Once again, it's great seeing Robert Conrad and Ross Martin reprise their famous roles, but they cannot redeem a silly script that plays everything for laughs. A missed opportunity."
3,Functional,"This chainring is spaced for 10x. To operate it with an 8x system, you'll need 1mm spacer washers known as axle spacer washers. Wheels Mfg. is the source.The metal of this chainring isn't as hard as I'd like, so do pay close attention to chain wear and never allow a stretched chain to run on this ring.Similar products used: TA 36 ""middle"" which has none of the above problems."
3,Too hard for a 3 year old,"This is a well-designed game and my son really likes to watch us play it but he is light years away from being able to do it himself. Frankly, my husband and I had trouble with a lot of the puzzles ourselves and we are both engineers. I was surprised that the previous reviewer said her 4 year old could do it, since I thought it would be pretty hard even for a six year old. Maybe we just haven't had enough practice yet."
2,Not So Much,"I'm glad that everyone else was delighted, but this software was only a mild success at my house. The program can be frustrating in how narrow the acceptable area is to successfully place the many objects George needs to employ to complete his Rube-Goldbergian journeys. If your child isn't already very good with a mouse, this game will prove frustrating. Often the physics just makes no sense. My 4-year-old son couldn't understand that the program was asking him to put a trampoline on top of a light pole -- because he knew that wouldn't work. This from a kid who thinks you can build a working space shuttle out of cardboard boxes. We spent most of our time clicking on the ""hint"" icon that shows you where the props need to be placed and just plopping them down accordingly. Pretty much not the point! File this under a great idea that should have worked better than it did."
1,Complete waste of money,"André Rieu is a pretty average fiddler with a lot of marketing behind him. Please buy a virtuoso's CD instead (like Kremer, Mutter, or Perlman).PS: ""O, mio babbino caro"" does not mean ""My darling boy"" as stated in the music sample list, but ""Oh, my dear father""."
5,Andre Rieu - Romantic Moments,"Oh, So beautiful---- every track!!!!! My personal favorite has to be the soothing SERENATA. So, get comfy, put on the headphones so you won't miss a single note...... Andre Rieu's violin is magical!!!!!"
3,Okay,"You can tell right from the box art that this game is not exactly what you want. Wario, Luigi, and Yoshi were not in the original game. This is NOT just Super Mario 64 ported to the DS; Nintendo tried to change the game significantly. The original levels are all still here; however, many of the stars have either been modified or changed altogether. Each character has different abilities and gets different things from ability hats. It is frustrating at times to get within a stone's throw of a star only to find out the character you came into the level with can't actually obtain that star. I understand the urge to do something slightly different, but I really wish they hadn't. Super Mario 64 is not a game that needed help. It's still a good game, and it's still fun, but the changes are unnecessary and often get in the way."
5,Mario doesn't disappoint,I am a long time fan of the Mario franchise and this game is no disappointment. My six year old loves it
5,wow,"ok i actually own this game for my DS and it is and O.K. game the mini game feature is fully opperational with the touch-screen and i must say they are pretty awesome. the only problems i have about the mini-games is that the ones that you start out with arent the most fun but you earn by catching bunnies the really fun ones! so dont loose hope :D. the adventure mode (1 player) is just like the origanal for the N64 eccept you play as 4 characters. the only thing i dislike about it is that you dont start out with Super Mario and you start out with Yoshi. but it is still fun. i would rate it a 4.5 but you cant do .5's just to let you know. the game graphics are also O.k. i mean there is better out there for the DS but HEY! its Mario it is supposed to be cartoony! so i enjoy the mini-games, graphics, and fun and affordable! i love Supper Mario 64 DS."
3,mediocre to the max.,"While I have to admit, this game was pretty fun, it got extremely boring after getting about halfway through the game. It got kind of monotonous after the first hour of gameplay. you'rehooked at the start, bored to tears an hour later. I think that if you haven't played the original it's a lot more fun. It would be better if it weren't so easy."
3,It was a gift and it came late so I had to returned it!!!,I got it to give it to my nephew and it came late (after my nephew's birthday) so I had to buy the game at Best Buy and return this one. It was like an old looking game (no the new look/version) compared with the one I got at Best Buy.
4,READ THIS NOW!,"THIS GAME IS GREAT! BUT I KNOW THEY SAY YOU COULD ""PLAY AS MARIO,LUIGI,YOSHI,AND WARIO."" THEY ARE WRONG YOU COULD PLAY AS ONLY ONE CHARACTER. WOW THAT JUST TOOK A STAR, BUT THE REST IS THE BEST!"
1,BOOTLEG! DOESN'T SAVE!,I bought this game because I wanted a portable version of the N64 version. I played it for a bit on my 3DS and thought it was everything I wanted. After playing I saved and quit out. However when I went to return to my game all my saved info was gone. I made progress and saved three separate times to see if I did it the wrong way. Nope. The game does not save which means it is more than likely a bootleg copy. If anybody can tell me if I am doing something wrong I will be more than happy to reverse this review but as far as I'm concerned this company lost all it's integrity selling me this bunk fake piece of trash. I was really looking forward to this game and this is my first negative experience of anything from Amazon.
2,Not Worth my $30.00,This game is disappointing. The controls are clunky and hurt your fingers.Don't Buy it new!
4,just plan fun,This game is just like the old one...but with some mini games...which are cool to play if you are bored waiting or something...the game play with both screen can get bothersome at times...but hey its still cool...
5,My Kids LOVE THIS GAME!,"It is more than just ONE game, you can unlock so many minigames, although My Nine year old did pass this game in under 20 days, he still enjoys the minigames and the 2 player mode!"
5,great game,"I bought this game for my 7 year old son and he just loves it, he won't put it down. Not only did I get a ""like new"" game, I got it 6 days before the scheduled delivery quote. I recommend this seller for all your gaming needs!"
4,"great game,awesome port","This is an awesome game.I got my DS 2 days ago and this was my first game.Being an owner of the Mario 64 for the N64 i thought it was just a port but there are many new levels.Also there are alot of addictive mini-games.The only bad part are the controls,it is kind of difficult to move around in 3-d with control pad but you get used to it.THe multi-player is allright but there are only 4 levels so it kinda gets old.Overall this is a very enjoyable game and i highly recomend this to be your first DS game."
4,This Mario Game is Great!,This game is great because you can draw pictures and annimate them. You can challenge other DS owners which is fun. You can gamble and play cards. Their is a certain game I don't like. But all in all this game is great. Must buy! Reccomened!
2,Just doesn't feel the same.,"Super mario 64 on the DS is quite good, just lacking without the analog stick. Even if the DS had an analog stick, it still doesn't feel right with the screens so small. I'd rather stick to playing the N64 version."
3,Clueless what to do...,The game is all good its just that you try to straighten out the game. They dont really tell you what to do in the game.
4,New Super Mario,"I have not played the game yet, as I bought it as a Christmas gift for my son. I really appreciate the quick shipping!!! Thank you so much!!!"
5,Super mario,I bought this for my youngest and she says it is a great game. She had stopped playing with her ds for a while and now she plays it all the time.
5,LOVED IT,"THIS GAME IS TOTALLY AWESOME, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR EVERYONE, I LIKE THE BOSS LEVELS THE BEST, VERY EASY TO PLAY"
5,This is a good game,This is a good game. I enjoyed it a lot. Buy this game if you would like to play Super Mario 64 DS on your Nintendo DS.
5,Awesome!!,I still own and play the N64 version of this game. I can't tell you how impressed I was that they put a new spin on this game and added lots of different stuff but still are in the same path with it. This game is very fun!
4,Good Classic,"A great classic turned into a handheld you can take and play anywhere, brings back the mario fun from way back."
3,Love The Mini Games,I have a hard time controling Yoshi in the regular part of the game. I have not gotten very far there. So I would give that part a less than stellar rating. Maybe 2 stars. It is the mini games that make this cartridge worth the money. You have several mini games from match and a majong like game to a game where you have to keep mario from falling.
5,It's cool,This game and the Super Mario are the best Mario's games ever. I stongly recomend it if you like playing Mario.
5,Still trying to get 150 stars...,"This game is great! I've played only a portion of the original Nintendo 64 version.The addition of more characters, missions, etc make this game a worthwhile purchase, definitely a must-have for any Mario enthusiast. Depending on your goal in the game, it can either be finished quickly, or take ages to finish. In fact, I'm going to go play it again."
4,very good game,"This game excited me so much i bought a game boy ds. This game started off fantastically but after i beat it i got very bored with it. Some stars are very boring and confusing to obtain. The new stars on the game are no very fun to get. They mostly involve collected 5 silver stars(which is lame because it is 2 much like collecting red coins)or hitting a switch and running to the star fast enough when it appears. But i really loved the mario on the 64 and the new charecters(yoshi,luigi,wario) are fun to play as. But this is basically the same game as the n64 and if u collected all the stars earlier you will find it boring to do the same again. 4/5."
4,really overall 3.5,my brother has the game and i love the mini-games they are very funi have a file and about 40-50 stars into it i quit playing (i dont know why)
3,Too Hard,I think this game is too hard. Here's a good tip: When falling from a high place ground-pound when your close to the ground or else you'll lose power.
2,THE WORST GAME FOR THE DS,"This game is really bad. It has all sorts of flaws and gliches. Firstly, the selection for the buttons are really bad. You have to move your fingers in odd positions to play right. Secondly, there is a problem in the first world. In one of the levels, MARIO WINGS TO THE SKY, is really poorly designed. You don't have the slightest clue of what you are supposed to do. Lastly, the graphics are really bad. You would think that this game would have really good graphics considering it is on the DS. HAH?!?!?!? THE GRAPHICS STINK!!! The only thing that I liked about this game was that Nintendo brought back a classic in the modern world. This game would be a lot more fun if the graphics were better, the levels were easier to understand, and the buttons were chosen better."
1,Not about game but delivery time,Although this item was Prime eligible and was supposed to be received in two days it is scheduled to arrive six days after being ordered. Thankfully it's still one day before it's supposed to be given as a gift.
1,Same thing!!!,"I have Super Mario 64 on my Nintendo 64 and I bought this thinking it would be different. Nope, the whole thing is exactly the same! I would not recommend if you own the other version"
1,They Should've Done it 10 years Ago!,"The reasone why I say they should've done it 10 years ago when the N64 was launched back in 1996 right after 1995 when the PS1 was launched Because I've been playing the N64 Version of Super Mario 64 for 7 years (since 1999) and The reason why I said they should've done it 10 years ago because Nintendo could've added more characters for the N64 version besides Mario they should've Added Luigi, Wario, and Yoshi. Nintendo Should've been sued for this marketing!"
3,"Great, but could be better.","Let me start out by saying this game is rather enjoyable. While the graphics are about the same as a Nintendo 64 yet a little sharper, the gameplay is amazing, as you can play with 4 people; Wario; Mario; Yoshi; and Luigi. One of the main problems is the difficulty. The movement is harder with the stylus and touchscreen, and using a control pad is not perfect. Also, it's more momentum-based and is very slipper, and you fall very many times. The difficulty is the worst part. Getting the normal stars is fine, but some of the secret stars or 100 coin stars are devilishly hard to find. But seeing as this is one of the only DS games, it's the only game you should buy, until more are released. Seeing my favorite N64 game on a handheld brings me bliss."
3,64 version is way better,"Super Mario 64 was a great game. Mario 64 DS is way diffrent. I love the fact that you can be Luigi, Yoshi, and Wario but the controls are very confusing to me. With the 64 you get the control stick and B and A plus the c buttons to look around. on the DS you only get 4 buttons plus directional buttons. It was confusing to me. But I loved the graphics. DS is the wave of the future. but for me I'll stick to my GBA SP."
3,too easy compared to the old version.,"the game is quite good, and the mini games are a nice touch, but why Nintendo did you make this game so easy. you can almost play the whole game with Luigi, and his huge jumps make the game way to easy. noways a lot of the new Nintendo games are just to easy for most Mario fans."
5,New player,"I'm new to the whole Nintendo DS and Mario game scene. I have a GBA but was never really good at most of the games.The one problem I've been having and the reason I entered 4 stars for how much fun it is....was because of trying to use the stylus for moving the characters around. I know you don't ""have"" to use it but I did try and it just didn't work so well for me, granted in some of the sections I had a hard time figuring out how to move them at ALL but I'm sure it's just me and I'm not coordinated enough. I've also gotten stuck on a couple areas where I can't figure out how to make it do what I want it to do. I know it says you can 'play as' all of the characters....but I'm still working on that part. I know what I need to do but not how to do it. :)Otherwise - it's going to keep me occupied for a while."
4,Super Mario 64 DS,"Super Mario 64 was one of the few really good games for the N64. Now, the fact that you can take it on the go is great. For people who have purchased a DS and have yet to play this game, this would be probably the best bet for your DS at this time.Though I would caution someone who has played the 64 version a number of times. I found myself whipping through the game in a few days. Thats not to say its not long. It will take some time if it's your first time. There is 30 additional stars to find, and alsothrought the game there are rabbits you find that unlock a number of mini-games for each character. While these games are pretty fun at the beginning, just because of the technology with the touch screen, they tend to all become old pretty quick.So, at this point in time, this is one of the best DS games to get. And, if you have never played MArio 64 before this should be your first purchase for your DS."
5,Much better game than its predecessor,"All these folks that say that this game is JUST like the N64 version must not have played the game at all. A lot of new levels, plus the new characters make this game awesome. Luigi is by far the best character in the game. My advice is to use Wario only when you have to. Awesome game."
3,The original version was way easier!,"I just bought this game for the Nintendo DS, and I was really excited about it. I have beaten the N64 version quite a few times, so I thought this would be just as good. The graphics are as good as the N64, but the controls are a bit iffy. It is very difficult to control the characters with the touch screen, and it is also difficult to control them with the control pad. They should have made the game easier to play. Also, I have saved my game data, and when I came back and turned it on again, all my data was erased! I don't know if I did something wrong. I had to start all over again. I didn't like that one bit. Over all, I think that the original N64 version of this game was way easier and more fun to play. I wish that the DS had an analog control stick like the N64 instead of the touch screen to control the characters with."
2,"A fine game, bad control","Lots of people think that the people at nintendo have really outdone themselves with the DS. I am not one of those people. if it had a better control pad, this game would be easier to play like its old twin, the original mario 64. using the analog stick was a breeze, but the control pad on the DS makes controlling things very clunky. and besides, the darn system itself is a waste of money."
3,Very Disapointing,"Ok, let me start off by saying that this is really a great game, with one big problem: IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE N64 VERSION. I mean, sure, it has new stars, characters and stuff, but all the same stars are in the same places. They have new ones, but all the original ones are in the same place. If you have beaten the N64 version, then you'll have this game beaten in one week. I got it on a Wednesday and beat it the next Saturday. BUT, for those you who have never played the N64 version, then I would recomend buying it. The only problem is it's a difficult game and will get very frustrating after a while if you have never played the N64 version. So, if you have NEVER played or gotten very far on the N64 version, I would suggest buying it. If you have already beaten the N64 version, I would strongly caution you against buying it."
5,no,I haven't bought the game yet but I might het it in a bundle pack for my grades oh I forgot the controls are hard to use
3,Could have been better..,"I got this game after coming back from holiday, and was expecting the typical Mario game. It kept to the classical Mario plots, but i think the controls need to be slightly changed to really enjoy this game. There were no real instructions, but i got the hang of it. It still had the good old sound affects, but i would recommend it to slightly more experienced players. Still, it's worth the money, and when you get the hang of it, you can really enjoy it!Leah Clayton [daughter]"
4,A Good remake with some bad updates,"I have been an avid nintendo fan since the NES came out, and when Super Mario 64 was released i was just plain syched, still a big nintendo fan i picked up a DS a few weeks ago, and along with it super mario 64 DS, The game starts the same way as the old version, peach inviting mario over to the castle and then disapeering, but the twist on this version is you start with Yoshi, not mario and have to get 8 stars before mario can be unlocked.CONTROLSthe controls for the game are trying to mimic a joystick with great success, the only downside is i'll be running and then my stylus reaches the end of the screen and i suddenly stop. this happens quite frequently. and it is harder to control so you may be running off cliffs more than you want to.GAMEPLAYjust really breif, AWESOME, I MEAN LIKE TOTALLY SHARKY COMPLETE, and just like original but with some bunus'PERKSminigamesOVERALLAWESOME"
5,Wow! CanDS really handle these graphics?!?,"In thought this game will be the best game that DS will have to offer. But lets think back when Nintendo 64 was the coolest system ever. Super Mario 64 was the best on that. I know personally because I used to have.(Now I cashed it in for the DS)This game has a very good story line, not mentioning the overall game. It had great grahpics. And the funny thing was that when you turned on the game you saw Mario and you got to move his face around. But getting back this game. It is improved because you get to play as 4 characters, Mario; Luigi; Wario; and Yoshi. This is great because it still holds the same graphics as on the 64. I saw some pictures of this game, and truly it is AWESOME. If you are buying the Nintendo DS, this game is a must have."
4,games,the kids just luved the games good product. games worked great cant get kids off now fast ship ment will recommend to family and friends.
3,Another revist,"Super Mario Ds is a great game. I liked it, but haven't we seen al this before? It was a total remake of the first one. However, you can be Yoshi, Wario, Luigi, and Mario. They all have diferent abilities which takes the game in a different direction. Great but you have to switch characters a lot to accomplish things. Good game. A must get for a DS"
4,Some things are better left fiddled with... no wait,"I recieved this in the mail the day after I recieved my Nintendo DS. I own the N64 version, but it gathers dust with the n64 system, so I decided to pick this up.PROSGood graphicsThe mini games are very addictingFor fans of the n64 version, it's a dream come true to be able to take it anywherenow...CONSControls can get confusingAfter you get most of the stars on the first floor and second floor (8-15 stars) it can become hard and frustrating. Even for someone that's played the original for years.Overall, pick up this game even just for the minigames. It may just be me, but don't expect to get too far."
2,not as fun as the original nintendo version,My kids don't play this game. They complain that there is too much running around and not a clear goal to accomplish. There are discoveries to be made but they would prefer the game to be modeled after the original nintendo series. The obstacles are too easy to get around and they just don't find this game entertaining.
2,crap,this game is crap i had to get rid of this the controls are sluggish don't buy the ds version if u have an N64 get the original or download it if u have a wii just avoid this at all cost
2,A Kid's Review,It's A Hard Game I Couldn't Beat The First Level I Am Not Joking If You Buy This Game You Better Read The Instructions Or Else You Will Suck At This Game PS. It Is Hard To Unlock Somebody.
2,MY DATA!!!!!!!!!!,"I had 80 stars but when i turned it on the next time, all of it was gone. i didnt even do anything to it. what a bummer..."
1,Disregard the stars,"Do not think that I don't like the game because of the 1-star rating. The only reason I am giving it this review is because I don't know a lot about it. This is because when I ordered it, it wasn't the right game! Instead, I got the game ""New Super Mario Bros."" also for the DS. It was in the ""Super Mario 64 DS"" case. I believe the real game is fun. I will make a review for the real game once I get it."
4,Great Buy,The game is great. the graphics are good just like the original. its just that the controls are way harder than he joystick on 64.
5,this game beats super mario sunshine any day!!,"This game is gonig to be awsome. so is metroid prime hunters. This game is going to beat super mario sunshine and the orignal super mario 64. this game has more stars than the orignal super mario 64. you can play as mario,ligi,wario and yoshi. You start as yoshi. Then you can play as the others. There are new mini games and levles. There is a secret levle thst looks soo firmilair from one of the mario games. I won't tell you. You'll have to find out when it comes out. It will come out on November 21, 2004."
4,REALLY FUN!!!!!!,"So if you like big, chalenging games,buy this. I own both a NIntendo64 and DS Lite.This version of the game is great.The minigames are really fun and they are not too easy. The game is hard and if I didn't know of some secret levels and how to get some stars, I would still have about ten.THis game has some extra levels, but they are all the same. you have to get five silver stars and then get the gold one, but that is pretty much the only kind of extra level.You can play four characters:Mario, Yoshi, Luigi and Wario. You collect these characters by beating bosses in particular worlds.Such as luigi.He is in big boo's haunt.The characters also have special powers, such as luigi, when you collect a flower from a box,dissapears and can go through things.The reason I gave the overall rating four stars is because the extra levels are all the same.conclusion: I wouldn't buy this game for a 7 year old, but if you play hard games alot,Buy it. you won't be sorry."
3,"Amazing platform game for the N64, so-so for DS","When Super Mario 64 came out on the Nintendo 64, the control style was great, with the anolog stick controlling Mario was a snap. Now you control Mario, Yoshi, Luigi, or Wario with the Control Pad, Stylus, Finger/Thumb, or Thumb Strap. Most of the controls are pretty bad, and you'll just stick with the Control Pad, which is unfortunately the best control type of them all. Adding 3 new characters, and 30 new stars is new. However, most of the ""New"" stars are just extra stars in a level (1 extra for each level) and very few new stages. Some things in the levels are changed from the original, with the creators trying to make the game easier then the original. I greatly like that idea, since the controls are sort of hard to control."
3,Fun for the first two days,I heard it was completely awesome and I got it but it was fun for a little bit it's just that it's really hard and it gets boring. It's a great idea to rent but not to buy.Other Mario games that's good: Mario KartMario Party and Super Mario Bros.
5,Everything of the original plus more,"Not only was Super Mario 64 a lengthy game, but it offered lots of entertainment. I was glad to hear that the original was brought onto the Nintendo DS, just the direct port was good enough for me. But not only did they port it, but they added new stars, levels ( paintings ), and characters as well which seems to be a huge plus. Like I said, I would have been happy to just have the original game itself, but they added to it as well, and its even longer than it once was. Good deal."
4,"Like the original, but with more","If you enjoyed the original, you'll enjoy this version. You get to use other characters with different abilities. It takes a little while to get used to the handling, but then so did the original. I guess I just expected really different levels as well..."
3,Old Nintendo user,"I am an older user of the Nintendo DS and I wanted to keep my brain active. I started with the Brain Age and have graduated to the Mario game. I figured that an easy game would be better. I am still not very agile, but enjoy it."
5,Fantastic!!,I can not stop playing this game. From it being so much fun. I love how u go into pantings for each level. You should buy this game if you do not have it.
4,Love this Game,"I love all things Mario. This was very classic in the way of the old games, but modern."
4,Interesting bites of Christian History,"The One Year Christian History is not an exhaustive ""greatest hits"" of Christian History nor is it intended to be. What it is is a book that offers bite-sized glimpses into the people and events that make up the rich history of the Christian faith. Although I would not recommend this book for anyone looking for an in depth daily devotion, I would recommend it for anyone who wants an interesting book laid out in an easy to read format for daily reading."
5,Bringing Christian history to life,This books provides short daily stories of real people that can serve as examples for us in our walk with Christ. Love this book!
3,Not what we expected,"My husband and I bought this with the intention of using it for a daily devotional book. We were disappointed with the content, which was more just about the lives of people than anything really ""Christian"". Even though the people featured are/were Christians, there isn't any more scripture than a few verses each day - and sometimes relating those verses to the featured story seems like somewhat of a stretch. Will be looking further for something more devotional that includes more scriptural application."
4,A challenging Devotional,I ordered this book from Focus on the Family and began it in 2007. Every day challenged me to pursue Christian living on a higher level. Some days gave me historical glimpses that contradicted the teachings that have been politically taught in schools. There were a couple of instances wherein ancient Hebrew dates may have been presumed rather than known for certain but all in all I highly recommend it to Christians who are determined to know the truth.
3,Trivia 4 Christians,"The writing in this book is dry and disconnected. It contains short essays and reporting of events and people you might like to have knowlege of, it's a sure fire yawn. This is one of those books that has a few gems in it, but it's mostly a good idea gone terribly bad."
5,Simply Awe Inspiring,I wake up salivating to read each days inspiring stories of the simple to the great. This challenges me each day to suck it up and live the life I'm called to!
5,Great Way To See What God Has Done!,This is a great book. Easy and fun to read. It's good for preachers to have stories and testimonies to share what God did in their pulpits.
5,Wonderful and Uplifting Book,This book is a superb way to get a flavor for church history. The stories are heartwarming and moving. The author takes the reader on a day-by-day journey that gets better with every turn of the page. Highly recommended!!
5,Truly a Favorite!,"The One Year Christian History is one of my ""go-to"" gift books for people I love. It makes a marvelous daily devotional--the entries are just the right length and are very insightful. In a day when many Christians are unaware of the brilliance, perseverance and sacrifice that laid the foundations for our faith, this book is a wonderful, easy-to-read tool that will educate and enlighten. You will return to it day after day."
1,t-seat,"color was just what I wanted, but the quality could be better, think the seat could be a little thicker & heavier constructed, don't know how durable this one will be"
1,This book was written by her graduate students!,Her graduate students are not getting any of the proceeds from this book - PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT!
1,boring wanna be pop star,"This album is absolutely boring! It was just more of the same after the 2nd song. I've seen Mr. Angotti perform in a religious setting and I'm sad to say that it is just that, a performance. It's more like the John Angotti Show then anything spiritual and prayerful. I'm surprised that he gets away with it. On the plus side he can sing. Taking more piano lessons might help with his musical composing. They can't hurt that's for sure. Simple arpegios abound. He needs his voice and a bewildered church audience to sell. Mediocrity keeps breeding throughout."
3,"Harsh, harsh lighting...","Well the bulb lights up and the price is right.It produces the harshest, downright uncomfortable light. Like old-fashioned, officer-worker, makes-you-want-to-jump-out-a-window, harsh. Ugh."
4,Very Good Book,"Good book to read if you want more of an explanation as to how essential oils work. Surprising information is given concerning how we could be using natural remedies to relieve viral infections, trauma, hormonal imbalances, chronic degenerative diseases, mental illness... the list goes on."
1,"SAME INFO, DIFFERANT OVER-PRICED BOOK","PLEASE NOTE - BOTH BOOKS BY THE GOOD DR. CONTAIN IDENTICAL RESEARCH!DO NOT BUY.....UNLESS you are interested in ketones, terpenes and hydrocarbons (buy used, there are plenty out there! if you have to), MOST of the information can be found after a couple hours on line searching!"
4,refreshing change,"Hong Ying presents a raw, unpolished notation of her life in the slums of China. It is a look at the other side of Chinese society, as compared with Falling Leaves, Adeline Yen Mah. Hong's style is strong and captivating in it's own, almost amateurish way. Daughter of the river, is highly recommended for anyone interested in Chinese society and life, without a strongly political slant, which seems to pervade so many other Chinese autobiographies, Three Swans, for instance. All in all, a good read."
3,A Chinese coming of age story.,"I found this book to be somewhat interesting for its time and place; the slums of Chongqing at the end of the Cultural Revoloution. The authors family situation is also somewhat interesting, but a bit too predictable. I also read one of the author's novels, that I picked up off the sale table in Hong Kong and found it also just okay."
2,"If you must read it, borrow it from the library.","I just had a hard time reading/understanding/finishing this book. I did finally finish it because I wanted to know the mystery behind the author's father, but in the end the whole book was disappointing. I guess it's a matter of the book's structure. The author jumps from one time setting to another so often, it gets totally confusing! Also she intertwines different stories of different family members and other people in her life, that it's easy to confuse the characters. Some of the language sounds awkward, the curse words seem...forced. Also after a while, the author's unceasing bitterness towards life tended to grate on my nerves."
2,Don't bother,"In America we might have called the author a self-absorbed, spoiled brat...but given the era she grew up in, the abject poverty and the political upheaval, I might be tempted to forgive most of her ego-centricism. However, the story remains predictable, without any endearing characters (yes, I know they are real people, but even real people should have something intriguing about them). Perhaps the author should have written a story about her father instead...I did get intrigued by the mother's story, too."
1,This is the second book that I've been unable to finish,"Rarely have I been unable to finish a book, even when it's quite terrible. However, this book was unreadable to me.There is no rhyme or reason to this book. There's no linear progression. It's more of a ""This happened when I was 5. This happened when I was 15. This happened when I was 12. This happened when I was 5."" The book goes nowhere and there is no plot to follow.After reading the glowing reviews here on Amazon, I was very much looking forward to reading this book. However, after reading half of it, it's in a box in the closet..."
4,Informative,"A good manual, but a little hard to follow for the average non-medical person. It makes a good complement to The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook, which is easier to read."
5,"Relief, Validation, Understanding, A future","Until I read this book, recommended by a friend of mine who suffers also from FMS, I didn't feel I had any of the above to look forward to in my life. I was ready to give up on ever having a future, days without pain, confusion, understanding or ever see a relief even for a day or two from my pain. I was ready to give up on life period! Chronic Pain does that to you I know. But reading Dr. Starlanyls book opened up some new horizons to me. More than knowing what was happening to me, it was wonderful to hear her supportiveness, validation and understanding that could only come from a physician who has the syndrome as well. Most of all this book gave me the strength to not give up the fight. Dr. Starlanyl you are a godsend!"
5,Plaudits for a Pioneer,"Some reviewers might have missed the fact that Doctor Starlanyl's book was the first to offer help instead of merely a symptom chronicle. This book blazed the way to open doors, each leading to venues for some relief from fibromyalgia. As a clinician whose practice is limited to fibromyalgia, I have seen hundreds of patients who came for help because of the validation this book afforded very sick people. As an author who followed in her footsteps (four years later), I can attest that further progress has been made but that does not weaken the vast amount of information contained in Devin's labor of love. She remains compassionate to the cause of helping others and this book is but the beginning of that continuing endeavor."
5,Best book about fibro,"I have numerous books about fibromyalgia, and this is the best book I've found. I like it because it addresses some of the less common side effects of fibro. It's comforting to read from a trustworthy source that the symptoms I am experiencing are linked to fibro and that others experiencing them too. I also like the weight management considerations the book provides, which is something I haven't found in other fibro sources."
2,Too much drama,"I have have been diagnosed with FMS for three years. As a medial writer with a medical background, I appreciated the authors' medical as well as personal viewpoints- and the severity of their symptoms they describe. I also appreciated the very important contributions they made in addressing the nature and placement of trigger points.The book is bleak, however, with repeated descriptions of the author dragging herself to type for 20 minutes at a time, only to be saved by the nimble hands of a massage therapist. High drama, but not very inspiring. Many books have been written since this publication that are far more useful (and informative) to those of us trying to guide our way through the many difficulties of this disease. If you have only a few dollars to spend, know that trigger points are important and show up almost everywhere, then move on to spend your dwindling dollars elsewhere.."
3,Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain: A Survival Manual,This is the most helpful book I have seen about Fibromyalgia. It helps to esplain this very frustrating condition and some helpful treatments. I ordered this book as a used copy. It was promptly delivered and brand new.
1,Fibromyalgia is not as bleak as this book.,"Fibromyalgia is a challenge, but unfortunately for Dr. Starlanyl and her readers, she represents it as a virtually impossible challenge that you can barely live with. While some of her basic facts on the disease are accurate, she does her readers a great disservice (ESPECIALLY being a doctor) by portraying this condition as something that practically ends your life. It is true that when you first ""develop"" fibromyalgia, it is a bit overwhelming, but, contrary to what Dr. Starlanyl ""explains,"" there is A LOT you can do to VASTLY improve your symptoms -- to the point, in fact, that you can get your life COMPLETELY back. If you want to feel better (and you DEFINITELY can), buy a book that shows you how to do exactly that -- there are several great ones, but this one by Dr. Starlanyl isn't one of them."
2,Not so easy,"This book is well-presented, but, as a sufferer of fibromyalgia I found it tiring to read, because the information and acronyms used were unfamiliar and slanted very much towards medical therapy, rather than simple and clear descriptions of symptoms and how to alleviate them. I imagine this book would be most useful to general practitioners and therapists, but I cannot recommend it to anyone suffering from either FMS or Chronic Myofascial Pain."
2,Not another GRAY BOX! UUGGHH!,"Most of the info is great, but what absolutely turned my stomach were those horrible gray boxes filled with simpering, whining, COMPLETELY self-serving personal comments from the authors on their illnesses.GIVE ME A BREAK!So they didn't feel good -- I got it already! -- well, if you are reading this book YOU DON'T FEEL GOOD EITHER! I really wanted to look each one of them in the eye and say: GET OVER YOURSELF!"
5,In Depth Undestanding,The book is not only a great teaching tool but will remain as a number one reference in the future. I wish I would have known about this book years ago.
4,Very good information,"Well thought out...and very specific. I am new to the FMS/MPS illness....I was not aware I had it. This book has been a very clear guide to give me insight into what is really going on, options to reduce my pain and stress and many other helpful pieces of information."
5,Fibro & Chronic Myofasial -Survival Manual -,The book is outstanding. I have been searching for a book that would offer both a medical description yet offer an explanation in lay person terminology. It has brought me a lot more insight into the disorder than any other book I have read so far. I highly recommend this to anyone that has Fibro or CM or knows someone with the disorders.
5,The Best Information on Fibromyalgia I Have Read,"This book contains the best and most information on Fibromyalgia I have found so far. I've read many books on the subject. This one I've kept and have referred back to on more than one occasion. As new symptoms appear, I can refer to the book for the recommended treatments. Then I can share them with my Dr. and we pick the ones to try. Some work for me, some don't, but I have found relief from the suggestions in this book."
4,Fibroymalgia completely understood,"I dont own this book, I picked it up at a neighbors house while watching their dog. I was impressed. The book was well written, it does not talk over the heads of the readers, it is informative while not being preachy. I think anyone suffering from this disease or anyone who knows someone who suffers from fibromyalgia would benefit by reading this book."
3,Good Information,I have chronic pain along with Fibromyalgia. Bought the book to learn more about it. It was OK but it is just as easy as finding information about this dreaded disease just on the Internet.
5,"This book is a ""must"" when you have FMS",First of all - this book has made me realize what an awful disease FMS is! Next - I don't know what I should do without it- the book that is! I was diagnosed 7 month ago and since then I have been reading and reading. But I never got the answer to all my questions - not before now. A great thanks to the authors; you don't know what it means to realize that you are not alone!!! And that I am not crazy - my body actually do these strange things. It is a great book - and very big and heavy..
5,This is my Fibro Bible,"Since being diagnosed with fibromyalgia, I have read several books. This book provides the basis and starting point to understand the problems and begin to find solutions. I found the personal applications touching - I laughed and cried as I read this book and began to see myself thru the pain and suffering of the author. I like the fact that she considers and recommends such a wide range of alternative treatments and therapies. The nutritional and diet information she gives has been the basis for my own treatment, based on her information on the yeast connection - something most medical texts on fibromyalgia do not discuss or consider. I recommend that any one with fibromyalgia/chronic myofascial pain/chronic fatigue get this book for their personal library. Read it first, take it all in, then follow her advice and start moving forward toward better health."
2,Way too detailed,"I have have been diagnosed with FMS for three years. As a medial writer with a medical background, I appreciated the authors' medical backgrounds- and the severity of their symptoms. I also appreciated the very important contributions they made in addressing the nature(s) of trigger points.The book is bleak, however, with descriptions of the author dragging herself to type for 20 minutes at a time, only to be saved by the nimble hands of a massage therapist. High drama, but not very inspiring. Many books have been written since this publication that are far more useful (and informative) to those of us trying to guide our way through the many difficulties of this disease. If you have only a few dollars to spend, there are other places to spend it."
5,This book is an absolute must for anyone suffering from Fibromyalgia,I wasted a lot of money and time reading everything that I could get my hands on about Fibroymalgia until I found this one. This book has saved my life in more ways than one. When my doctor was still telling me that Fibromalgia didn't exist this book convinced me that I wasn't losing my mind. It is full of helpful hints to help the suffer get through the worst days and to lots of suggestions as to how to pace themselves through the good days. I read this book as faithfully as I do my Bible and learn something new each time that I do. I highly recommend this book.
5,Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain: A Survival Manual,"This book not only gives great insight into these two distinct conditions but it lays it all out in terms that anyone can understand. It helps you to understand your condition and the history that may have led up to it's manifistation. Easy read and helpful, helpful, helpful...wish my Doctor had had this great information too."
4,Great Collection!,"Now all we need is a separate disc with a full show performance and the remaining videos that were omitted from this collection.The ending of this program is rather ""bitterish"". They hint that not all is well in the Garbage camp... but try to save face.Anyways, this is a great disc, get it while it lasts!"
4,I Love This Band,"The contrast of these seasoned older producer/musicians with the lovely siren, Shirley, fronting the band is bizarre at times, but the strength of their playing, and her sassiness make this a sure hit. Enjoy"
5,Absolute Rocking Popmusic,"Great stuff and first dvd with 15 various video's from the start to the last album that shows how this band still rocks, although their existence at this time is unsure to continue.....rumours of Shirley Manson going solo..Also a 65-minute ""Thanks For Your Uhh, Support"" documentary, showing you the band at close range....Why is the Region 2 release different in having 3 extra video's??Please continue to make groundbreaking music that never failes to produce quality with beautifully and original arranged melodies.Videoquality of the highest in Aspect ratio: 4:3 / 1.85:1 and 2.35:1 and sound is OK, even when the audio stucks at Stereo 2.0, maybe the best you can get with real music, 'only' from 2 speakers...Thanks for this dvd people, this makes my day......now the next new album please..."
4,Stunning Garbage,"Garbage's second video collection (first of which was the Garbage VHS in 96) puts together 15 of their best videos, according to the record company, that span their long career.Not a boring band that puts out lame amateurish videos, Garbage videos are highly stylistic and visual due to the personality of its lead singer Shirley Manson.Favorites here include the seminal Queer, Stupid Girl, Push It (where headless people are found), Special (where Manson becomes a pilot in a video game), The World Is Not Enough (with its 007 espionage clone drama).Glaring omissions include the stylish Androgyny, Breaking Up The Girl, Run Baby Run and Tell Me Where It Hurts (they even left the new video out). When I Grow Up is also the live version rather than the video version.For a DVD which is able to hold much more, the record company acts like a miser here, providing an incomplete video track list. Guess we just have to wait for their 25th anniversary to get a complete one."
3,not all the videos,does not include video's for 'Breaking up the Girl' 'Androgyny' 'Show Me Where It Hurts'(which was the single off the album version of Absolute Garbage but not included in the video anthology!) and the animated video for 'Shut Your Mouth'It's entertaining none the less.
2,This set needs another warning label...,"It has a parental advisory...now we need to be told that (as has been pointed out) not every video the band has done was included...there's also an animated version of ""Shut Your Mouth"" that isn't here...But we should have been warned that one - ""Queer"" - has been altered! What's with the picture suddenly going out of focus several times during the bridge of the song? And the audio has been changed...you don't notice until the end. There's also something about ""Push It"" that doesn't seem right...can't put my finger on it yet.Bought this thinking I could finally do away with my VHS and the video clips I've collected over time...no such luck. Really disappointed in that."
1,Don't blame Iron Maiden for this crap!,"Please go to www.ironmaden.com for all of the authorized CD's and DVD's. The band and their management have repeatedly warned fans about these unauthorized products.Iron Maiden has nothing to do with them, hence the shoddy quality of this product."
1,Not worth it!,"I agree with all the reviews here so all I have to say is thatThis is simply bad, not worth wasting your money. ""Unauthorized"" is too big of a word for this DVD."
5,Good Product,This may not be the most expensive filter but it works great on my digital camera. It is well worth the money and the low cost will encourage you to replace it when it does eventually get scratched.
5,HEAL LIFT CRITIQUE,My right leg is shorter than my left and was causing severe lower back pain. I started wearing this lift in my right shoe and my back pain has been eliminated. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is suffering from back pain and thinks it could be their shorter leg that is causing the back pain.
1,"Cambion Heel Lift - 1/4"" - Don't waste your money!","I purchased a Cambion Heel Lift (1/4"" - Large) and was completely disappointed! The ""large"" size is entirely too small even for a men's size 9 shoe. The angle of the lift and the density of the material makes it extremely uncomfortable. You are better off using a rock!"
2,not the best,"these were very uncomfortable. they also came off the shoe, as they stuck to my socks. i will not buy them again."
2,Still looking,"I have been wearing a different lift in one shoe for over 6 months in a regular enclosed shoe. When Summer arrived and I couldn't come up with a way to keep the lift that I have attached to a sandal I began to search for one that would do the job. I had high hopes for this lift so when it arrived in the mail I immediately put one in my sandal. Even though it is very cushy it was very uncomfortable. In my opinion the lift should be a good 2 inches longer and should gradually taper, like a door stop. It drops off too abruptly and causes my arch to be elevated to the point that it does not touch the arch support in the sandal. Also it did not stick to my sandal for very long. My granddaughter found it on the floor, picked it up and asked, ""What's this?"". I hate wasting money but this did not work for me so the search continues."
3,I'd recommend some way so it doesn't roll around in a shoe,"It does what it's supposed to do, but i had to add tape to hold it in place in some of the shoes I have. Time will tell it's durability."
2,Cambia Heel Lift Review,"The heel lifts are just okay. they are a little narrow which suprised me, and that tends to make them uncomfortable for my larger heel. That seems surprising given that they were large. Would not buy them again."
1,"Uh, no...","I've been wearing a heel lift since 1969, so I know what to expect and what is too much to expect. The concept of this lift sounds good, but in reality, it isn't. The lift will stick... either to your shoe and your heel, or just your shoe, or JUST YOUR HEEL within the same wearing. I guess it wouldn't matter with a closed shoe, but since these as transparent, I wanted them for backless sandals. I also wouldn't recommend them unless you have a narrow shoe, since the lift is very narrow."
4,perfect for my size shoe ...,"one leg is slightly shorter, so the chiro gave me a shoe lift which didn't really fit that well (too wide and long, but i guess hers are one-size-fits-all). this one is great, narrow enough to fit my size 7.5M shoes, and ""squishy"" so it absorbs shocks. don't particularly like that it's sticky on both sides (i tried to remove insole to stick underneath but insole wouldn't budge; not much luck with my other shoes). i see from other comments that people remove and wash, but i probably won't bother so i cut away the plastic backing to the shape of the lift and left it on top. we'll see how it holds up.i ordered the small size, and it is quite narrow, so this probably won't work for wider feet or boots. approx. 2"" x 2.75"" at its widest points."
2,"not the best heel lifts, but not bad for the price","I purchased these heel lifts because I was having chronic shin splints. I was running 3-5 miles every day when the problem occured. These lifts provided enough of a shift in the way I plant to aleviate the problem, but there is one drawback. The heel lifts slide way too easily. I ended up putting them underneath another insole and that helped, but still didn't prevent the slippage. You almost have to glue them in which I was hesitant to do. If you are just wanting these to make you look taller then I'm sure they are fine, but for running they are a little bit of a challenge."
5,Number one Christmas book,The hardcover copy of The Baker's Dozen is my favorite Christmas book. I read it every year to children at a school across from my office.
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I have read Boyer's ""Driftless Spirits"" and thought it was excellent. I am now trying to find a copy to buy. I live in the midwest and love trains, and liked ""Driftless Spirits"" so much that I purchased ""Snow On The Rails"" without even glancing inside it. What a mistake! Most of these railroading stories could be excellent, but every one that I have read is full of obscenities and other vulgarisms. Plus explicit descriptions of lesbianism in at least two of them. ""Driftless Spirits"" contains nothing like this. The really sad part is that these stories could be told without these vulgarisms. They add nothing, in my opinion. I suppose that today, many people believe that such things add ""realism"" and ""character"" to a book. If you are such a person, grab this book, it will thrill you. For any of you who may still have a sense of aesthetics, don't waste any time or money on this trash."
2,"Good price, but only for beginners","As the title says a good price but only for beginners you can learn with this one hit it hard an then buy a better one, i expected a little bit more from this racquet, it's a little bit shaky and it doesn't feel good."
2,Not necessary,This is a nice map but really not necessary. We just returned from the Bariloche area. There are so few roads & trails that the area is easy to navigate and this level of map is available for free pretty much anywhere.
3,Loses steam,"And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself starts off as a very interesting and exciting movie based on the true story of Pancho Villa financing his revolution by selling the movie rights to an American film company. The fact that the events really happened makes for a somewhat comical and unbelievable story, and overall very interesting because it is true. Eventually though, the story gets told, but the movie does not end.Antonio Banderas was superb, and when his character is not featured for the last part of the movie, the quality of the movie suffers. He delivers the right combination of joker and heartless tough guy while maintaining a leadership quality. This film may not be the best way to learn about the Mexican revolution led by Pancho Villa, but it is an interesting point of view."
1,"balderdash, marketing film fiction as pseudo history","This is a B grade movie for HBO that is not even up to that networks standards. Disclaimer at the start {this movie could have happened.......] does not cover the utter nonsense of this film.Yes Pancho Villa did cut a deal with a movie company to shoot his revolution and that is where this movie takes off in a blaze of BS. YES, antonio Banderas is handsome, spanish and swaggers around alot. YES, Pancho Villa was an amazing historical character that fought the repressive totalitarian regiems of Diaz and Huerta for ten turbulent years of the mexican revolution. YES, This film is stupid hollywood pulp made to make money and the same old stuff repeated over and oevver again. Also, why does every film have William Randolph Hearst as the ""the bad guy"". I'm getting tired of this device and it is also fiction passed off as history. negative stars would be better becasue this is bad for you to watch as it totally mis represents the truth."
1,Not Real!!,"I am from Chihuahua, México, Pancho Villa's land. I have taken history of my country and especially of the Mexican Revolution because Chihuahua and ""Los Dorados de Villa"" were the protagonists of that war. When I saw this movie I just could not see it as a movie based on the real history. I want to ask this questions: Where is the original movie that supposedly was taken in the Torreon's battle? Where is the movie that was exhibited in Nex York? Where is the copy of the movie that was given to Pancho Villa? Why is not there any Mexican or international researcher able to prove the existence of that film?"
4,Pancho Villa,It was well played by the actors Bandera and the rest. The story was also authenic according to the Mexican histories we read.
2,"misplaced history,as usual","Love Antonio Banderas, he did a good job, I found it humoures that he as a Spaniard played Francisco Villa who hated Spaniards with a passion, was irritated the writers did not write about Villa with enough knowledge, his real name was Doroteo Arango, he took the name of the man who taught him to be a bandit after he ran away from his Patron Therefore himself and the gringo could not have shared a ""name in common."" Villa hung my first wife's Father so he was never a hero in our Family. But an amazing man none the less. At least they portayed Fierro right, my first wife's mum saw him slaughter many people, a cold blooded killer. Other than that it was an entertaining film"
3,THE LOST REELS OF PANCHO VILLA,"It is fair to say that we do not remember Noah for his drunkeness but for the Ark that he built to save many....Pancho Villa was trully guilty of fighting against a corrupt Mexican Dictatorship and attacking Americans who had illegally settled on Mexican soil. It is easy to undermine such histories when making a film that reads like a one page synopsys of a man who struggled to change his country for the better. Antonio Banderas attempt at portraying Pancho Villa as a charismatic, self determined leader comes off well but falls short due to the limitations in script and budget. This film should be seen as an introduction to versed films like ""Pancho Villa"" or ""The lost Reels of Pancho Villa."" Only then might the true complexity of his life and struggles be understood.""learning without wisdom is like a bunch of books on a donkeys back""-ZNHurtson"
4,Friendship During War,"During the Siege of Leningrad in 1942, Boris and his friend, Nadia, are trying to keepthemselves and their families alive off what little food they had. Nadia's brother told herwhere she could find some potatoes. She and Boris went off in search of them. Theynever found the potatoes. Three days later Nadia died.A few weeks after Nadia died the Russians made a break in the German lines and trainswere able to bring food for the children. Boris couldn't wait to share his package withhis mother."
2,No Music???,This is detailed step by step but he must not be licensed to use the original dance songs with the DVD because the music thats played faintly in the background is not even the songs that go with the dance. Instructor very dry and monotone. You're better off trying to find it for free with You Tube.
3,"No party action there, just basic footwork.","Very thorough basic step instruction, but no party action. If you want the arm movements and line dance moves with good country music, you might need another DVD. With knowledge of footwork, I can now follow the music but do not look or feel like a line dancer."
5,PARTY LINE DANCES by SHAWN TRAUTMAN,"This is a great DVD. I bought it for my son, who has Special Needs. He attends a lot of dances and is always on the dance floor, but has never been able to figure out how to do the Electric Slide or Macarena. Neither my husband nor I knew how to do these dances either. I played the ""Party Line Dances"" DVD, and asked my son to follow Shawn's instructions. Pretty soon he was moving along with Shawn, and doing very well. And by joining a few of our son's practices, my husband and I quickly picked up the dance moves too. My son now participates fully, and we look forward to line dancing at our own occasions."
5,Fun Stuff!!,This DVD was also GREAT! We started with the Quick Start Guide to Line Dancing and went immediately into this one. This DVD was different in that it gave some fun options to do for the dances rather than focusing more on the steps and it had some new ones. We breezed through this DVD being that we were comfortable with the steps. This DVD's also really easy to learn from and definitely a great value. Our favorite was the Tush Push! GEORGE
4,This DVD was easy to follow and a lot of fun,Shawn Trautman is great in this instructional DVD. His instruction was easy to follow and a lot of fun. I recommend this DVD to anybody wanting to learn basic line dancing.
3,Good book for new birders in Pajistan,"The Helm Field guide Birds of Pakistan is certainly a nice guide and an improvement from the much more extensive Birds of the Indian Subcontinent as it focusses on Pakistan only. However, I still miss a number of plates for identification and the drawings frankly speaking do not equal those of e.g. Collins/Swensson's Birds of Europe. Too bad that no flight drawings of e.g. wheatears are included. Inevitably, some areas of Pakistan have been better covered than others, but who is to blame for that?"
3,Just OK for us,"While these bibs are certainly an improvement over cloth for feeding baby solids, they are not my favorites.On the plus side, they are very good for a diaper bag as they fold up small and rinse off easily. They are generously sized. They wash well and dry very quickly. The packaging is cute for gift-giving, and the washcloth is nice, although somewhat small.Unfortunately they never worked very well to keep my baby clean! The flat pocket in the front caught very little food and feedings were still quite messy. The bib tended to get wet through, especially along the seams of the pouch and at the neck. Worst of all my son absolutely hated wearing this bib, and he pulled at it nonstop trying to remove it. He is reasonably tolerant of other bibs, so I think this was truly uncomfortable on him.These bibs are ok, but I have found other ones I like better for daily use, and rarely use them any more."
2,Lotta money - little help,"i am disappointed with this device. I am easily capable of backing up my files, but since the files are too large, I am unable to make a ""restore"" file on a CD."
4,pfffft who needs a Treo...,"In a word, this thing is AWESOME! Windows Mobile has really come into its own as a viable platform to run Mini-Apps on.Plus with all the features you get, it's just the neatest gizmo you could have. Sprint may not offer the Treo yet, but why bother if you have Sprint for Wireless and want an Uber gadget... a few caveats:1) It's difficult to dial on the road, I wouldn't even try (cool, reinforces phone safety!)2) The digital camera is good for everyday use, but dedicated digital cameras do far better, don't take this thing along on your vacation and expect it to take good pics in and of itself.3) Can't do any subscription music services near as I can tell without buying ""Buy and burn"" privileges to store on your PPC-6700, not a big deal with me though.4) RAM is a bit skimpy, get an expansion card with it to begin with, fortunately, Mini-SD cards are cheap."
1,"Good toy, Bad phone","This is my second phone (6700) in the past 6 months, its half broken. I am heavy phone talker approx. 4000 minutes a month, I regret buying this phone.1- Pull out keayboard not convenient at all.2- You must press send/receive to upload or download email.3- I can't send email from my general account. Tech support can't solve the problem.4- Voice stopped working, only works with earphones. (second phone already with same problem. (I guess thats why its a smart phone)5- Battery life on this phone is a disaster!!I recommend Blackberry, I have heard there phone is long lasting and email is terrific."
1,The battery is time bombed...,"I bought it few weeks after launched. In my first day using it I found a ""battery"" problem: even in standby mode (no bluetooth or wireless lan activated) the phone died in less than 8 hours. I went back to Sprint and they told me it was not their problem. I called UTStarcomm. The customer service was so friendly like a terrorist: ""send us the phone (I had to pay for shippment and wait 2 weeks to receive it back)to New York at .... and hand the phone)"". Well, 2 weeks later they told me the phone and the battery were ok (no further explainings. I bought another (extend) battery because I have a 2 year plan with Sprint (shame on me. Although the site says ""200 hours in standby mode), my record was 14 hours.So, if you like a cool gadget and talk is not a problem, it is a nice PocketPC. If you want a Phone Edition, try the new Q from Motorolla or the new Samsung one..."
1,"Bad design, defective..terrible phone","Our company was acquired and they gave us all PCS-6700 phone as Blackberry's were no longer supported. I have used this phone for almost a year and it is terrible in every respect. Poor battery life, clunky keypad, loose stylus hole so I've lost 6 or 7 stylus's (I now do without). It's loaded with features you will never use and if you do the battery drains quickly. I have to keep paperclips in my briefcase because it has to be re-set for frequently. In another month my contract is up and this one is going in the trash. It's universally hated at the company where I work and for good casue. It's an awlful phone."
2,"Do not buy this phone, it is ""quirky""","I have owned this phone for almost 1 year now. It is very quirky. It freezes up, has zero analog signal, and very poor digital signal reception. Constantly freezes up and has a very slow response. So the operation system is just poor.The software however is super! Excel, Word, Media Player work just fine. Internet is very fast and available anywhere digital service is."
3,"Decent, but nowhere near great (for health professionals)","I guess this review is geared towards the doctor/medical student/health professional looking for a functional phone that can handle medical software. When it comes down to it, this phone is a POS for when you are getting pimped, but decent when it comes to looking up dosages. It responds sluggishly to your every command, as if it doesn't want to be awoken from its state of slumber. This, of course is useless when your Attending wants to know which subtype of ATP binding cassettes is nonfunctional in Tangiers disease. Otherwise, when you have a couple of seconds to wait for this slow beast to wake up, it is decent.It is very big, and very bulky, but has everything you need, though you must be patient.Cliffs: decent, but very very slow. Doesn't load epocrates/similar software quick enough."
3,Excellent Keyboard & Wi-Fi; Lousy Windows Pocket PC Software,"I have owned this phone for 2 years. But buying this phone was a big mistake, using Windows Mobile software is a nightmare. You have to go through at least 4 steps to dial Speed-Dial numbers on this phone!Although this phone is full of numerous features, you can't use most of them because this phone freezes and hangs up so much. You have to take the battery out and put it back to get the phone working again.In comparison to Windows Mobile, Palm software is pleasure to use. After having used 2 palm phones and 2 Windows Mobile phones, I don't think I will ever go back to Windows Mobile based phones again. Palm based PDA phones are very intuitive to use, although not completely trouble free."
2,Phone is a Major Disappointment on many levels,"I can't say enough bad things about this device. Save yourself from a headache and don't purchase this product. The battery does NOT make it through a day of minimal use. In order to have this phone work properly for you, you would need to purchase an extended battery with a price range from 60 - 80 dollars. The most disappointing feature of this phone is the phone's speaker volume itself. It is very hard to hear conversations, and it makes for many frustrating phone calls. Many colleagues of mine have decided not to purchase this device after they experienced first hand how poor the quality of the phone was. The phone however sounds excellent when plugged into a headset. The phone as it is, is bulky... let alone adding a larger battery onto it. For the money spent, I'm very disappointed. The manufacturer has cut many corners in making this device and it is evident. Shame on them!"
3,Honest review,"I was one of the first people to own this phone when it first came out. I was initially happy with the features and extras but quickly realized that it had flaws with the programs. I now have owned this phone for almost a year now and had it replaced five times.Pros:Watch movies, play music, full internet browser, sick slide-out keyboard.Cons:Bulky, Battery has short time span (extended battery helps but makes it more bulky), resets intermittently, monthly internet service is expensive, phone will lock up whenever it feels like it.Get the Blackjack or wait and get the iphone."
5,Great CD for teaching and learning!,I have never found a Dr. Jean CD I haven't liked. The songs are fun and educational! I use excerpts from all of her CDs throughout the day in my pre-k classroom. The children love the songs and are learning new concepts in a fun way. Songs and music are excellent teaching tools for all children - if you add a dance to go along with the song it will help the children remember the songs/skills being taught. I LOVE this CD and would highly recommend using these songs either at home with an individual child or in a classroom setting!!!!!
2,the companion,Watching Kathryn Harrold is a pleasant way to spend an hour or two. Predictable plot but not entirely a bust.
3,Nice but no cigar!,"Design & robotic execution outstanding. Floor was swept prior to use. On laminate flooring (ALOC) when completed, unit left little wet piles of derbis in several locations. When floor completely dry, Streaks were noticible. Takes 45 minutes to do a 5 minute job & then floor has to be touched up. Not a timesaver & not a worksaver.Returning item this date but I have to pay the S&H; charges, BUMMER. I guess I have to rethink on continuing a long & what has been up to now a happy relationship with Amazon.com"
2,"Misses corners, other spots, can't remove caked dirt, leaves floor wet, gets stuck easily.","Just got our Scooba and have been testing it out in the kitchen and bathroom. We're not too impressed. For one, it can't reach corners, nor does it really get the very edges of walls, so you end up having to mop those us yourself. Then it leaves the floor pretty wet, and during the many times that it gets stuck, if you stop it and lift it up, it leaves a dirty puddle of brown water behind. It seems to get stuck easily, as well as not recognizing the carpet (though it does get stuck on carpet, so at least it doesn't venture out into a carpeted room). Certainly not comparable to the Roomba, which we have and love!"
1,A Headache!!,"I looked forward to this for a long time only to be highly disappointed. I loved my Roomba when I had carpet, so when I moved to a hardwood floor apartment, I couldn't wait to buy Scooba.This thing never released any solution, the cover would NOT open without a fight and between the preparation for cleaning followed by the cleaning of the Scooba afterward...it's more of a PAIN than it's worth! I am angry also because this was delivered to me, so now I have to lug it back to the store by myself.Seriously, it's back to Swiffer for me.Simplicity is best sometimes. Especially when a product is not yet ready for market like this."
1,It doesn't work,I purchased the 5800 and couldn't get it to work. The Scooba wouldn't recognize the tank. I traded it in for another 5800 and the battery didn't connect properly to the robot. I traded it in for a 5900 and after 1 week it broke. I called customer support and they wanted me to mail it to them so they could replace it. The quality is poor.
5,scooba works great for dog owners,"I have 2 dogs with short hair who bring in a ton of dirt every day. The scooba has saved our house from the endless trail of dirt. We run it every 3 days on our kitchen floor, and end up with perfect results. It is so easy, I drink my coffee and read the paper in the morning while the robot does all the work!"
2,"""Okay"" First Attempt at Robotic Floor Cleaner","I have a large expanse of tile flooring in my house. It is a lot of work to keep it all clean, so I decided to try the Scooba. I am returning it today because:1. It emits a loud noise. This would be bearable if you were doing only one small kitchen floor or bathroom floor, but is not bearable for anything larger. Just imagine your vacuum running for a long period of time...The Roomba is only slightly quieter.2. You can only use the liquid cleaner that comes with it and nothing else. It does not have a very pleasant odor and if you are sensitive to artificial perfumes (as I am), it will be unbearable. They need to come up with something unscented or naturally scented. I guess what I mean is some choice in scents.It is really cool to watch, though, and I'll bet does a fine job. Probably better than I can do with a mop and bucket. Bottom line, though, is that it is only good for a small amt. of floor."
5,Lives up to it's claim,"I bought the Roomba Discovery and was so impressed with it that I went to the web site to see what other products were offered. I purchased the Scooba 5900 and just received it yesterday. I put it to work last night and I was totally impressed. The product lived up to it's claim. I had read several complaints about how it leaves water on the floor. In my opinion, there was no more water left on the floor than what would have been there if I had used the mop myself. You do have to take a rag and clean along the edges, but in the grand scheme of things, this is not a huge task. The bottom line is that I love it! Instead of saving the cleaning for the weekend, I can get it done during the week. Last night the Roomba was going in my living room, the Scooba was cleaning my kitchen floor and I was out in my garden doing what I love doing the most!"
1,Poorly designed product,"I bought both Scooba and Roomba but I regret the decision. With Scooba I had the battery problem. The manufacturer says that the battery should last hundreds of cleaning cycles when used according to their tips. After following all their instructions, the first Scooba battery lasted 10 cleaning cycles. I got a replacement battery from irobot which has lasted 20 cycles. Now the unit is out of warranty which means I have to buy a new battery at irobot store for $69.99.So I do not believe any of their claims concerning the battery.The Roomba did not give me battery problems but it stops every 5 minutes in the clean cycle asking me to clean the filter. After struggling a lot with this I finally figured out that it works continuously only if you select Max cycle. I don't think these units are made well and the expense is not worth it.Don't buy!"
1,"Up with Roomba, down with Scooba","When I purchased Scooba, I expected nothing but the same great experience I have had with the multiple Roomba products I have used over the couse of several years. I have been extremely disappointed with Scooba's incredibly touchy behavior. The tolerance for error when mixing the cleaning product with water to fill Scooba is absolutely nil. I am successful getting Scooba to actually clean my floors maybe 10% of the time. It now just sits in the corner, as I would rather clean my floors on my hands and knees than deal with the frustration of Scooba's error messages over and over and over."
1,Dreadful support,"Didn't last much over a year, just long enough to see the warranty out. Poor technical support. Never again."
1,Don't do it,"I purchased my scooba last year. In the past year I have not been able to use my scooba at least half of the time. I have had to update software when the battery died, I've called customer support repeatedly and get ""push this button, push that button"". Sometimes it works, sometimes I have to let it sit and keep coming back to try again. Now the battery is dead, again. Customer support says ""sorry, you're out of warranty. You have to buy a new battery."" Save your money. This product is bad, but customer support is even worse."
1,Poor Purchase,"Bought this as a gift 6 months ago and it worked without issue MAYBE 4 times....all the other times we had to deal with some type of error code. After writing to iRobot customer service and trying their 2 different solutions(without success); they suggested we buy a new battery. Okay...we spent another $60 to replace the battery, NOW there is a DIFFERENT error. Tech Supports next suggestion was to replace the machine! NO way, no how!! Can't invest any more money in such a poor product. I totally agree with the other review, if you purchase something at this price, it should last (at least) a few years without problems!"
1,Way Too Touchy for Home Users,"This iRobot Scooba has been nothing but a hassle since we bought it. Obvious to me is the over-precision required to assemble the stupid thing to get it into working configuration each time you want to use it. The latch securing the tank to the body broke. So did the vacuum port rubber seal. Too bad Amazon doesn't allow zero ratings, because this POS surely deserves one!"
3,"1 Month of Use, Just Okay.","First and foremost, I have a Neato for vacuuming. I love how it outlines the room, and then makes nice straight rows to get the rest of the room. I HATE how Scooba is random for the most part. It just looks stupid. It misses a lot, especially when the battery can't do a large room in one charge. The Scooba gets stuck on any little thing, even a rubber mat that is no more than 1/2"" thick with graduating edges. My Neato can climb over 1"" thick pieces of metal like a little 4 X 4 truck. There is a lot of in-between maintenance to do (clean mesh filter, port, brushes, squeegee, empty/rinse/fill tank). I would love to know what household cleaner I could use instead of the expensive Scooba cleaners WITHOUT voiding the warranty. I have 2 batteries just so I can get a good clean in a large room. The recharge time is ridiculous (4 hours!!!). In reality, this product is worth about $200. For the price I paid, it should do more - a lot more."
1,This P.O.S. didn't work!,"Save your money and all the aggravation of shelling out 200 bucks, then packing it up and sending it back. This thing is garbage. They couldv'e used another 2 years of development before releasing this dud.I bought based on the positive reviews. Perhaps I had a lemon, but it's not worth the risk. Do NOT buy!"
2,Only useful in VERY SPECIFIC circumstances,"Yes it works. However, it's a lot slower than just getting out a mop and bucket and doing it yourself. Unlike the Roomba, you have to fill this with water and soap beforehand, and empty it out afterwards. You have to take the thing apart to do so both times. Furthermore, you really have to sweep beforehand, so you're only saving half the job in any case."
1,"moody, unreliable",It has to finish it's cycle or it gets confused. It constantly has error lights flashing and the instructions don't say how to reset it. Very irritating and disappointing.
1,I hate robots! ... don't buy this online!,"I was excited and read all these positive reviews... I am sorry I purchased this item now. Waste of time. Mine came out of the box not working. The ""Tank"" error came up over and over again. None of the ""trouble shooting tips"" worked. I did nothing wrong during setup. After 2 days of trying to get IROBOT to answer their 1-800 customer support (oh you'll love listening to the music on hold for an hour each time!) they are having me UPS it back. Not a positive experience.I recommend you buy one from a store so you can return it immediately without the hassel I'm going thru.GOOD LUCK with your new ROBOT!!!!!! I hate mine."
3,Just an average product,"Unlike Roomba, I don't think Scooba works great. Here is my experience:I bought Scooba 4 months ago, I discovered Scooba has a problem of not picking up dirty water. Do you know how frustrated it was when I turned on Scooba and went to do something else and later on found out my dog was licking the dirty solution on the floor that Scooba hasn't pick up.However, if I clean and dry filter, tube and brush after each cleaning cycle, the problem seems to go away. The room need to be cleaned is 600 sq ft, and I divide it into 3 sections. Scooba takes 3 cycles to clean it which is 135 minutes. That means I have to clean filter, brush, tube 3 times (for each cycle) which takes about 20-30 minutes. If I mop the floor myself, it would be 45 minutes. Using Scooba, it takes 20-30 minutes of my time; mopping the floor myself, it takes 40-45 minutes. Well, it does save 15-25 minutes. Whether it is worth $300, you have to decide yourself."
4,I love it,"We bought the Scooba at a local store, and I was really surprised/amazed at how well it cleaned our hardwood floors. I expected to use this to do minor floor cleaning, then I would have to wash the floor myself every few weeks to really get it clean. I was very wrong, this thing does a great job by itself. I don't think I will need to wash the floor myself again as long as Scooba is functional. The cleaning solution has a very pleasant smell to it.The only complaint I have is that I cannot yet purchase additional cleaning solution at any local store I tried that sells the Scooba, I had to order it on the web (I bought 6 big bottles of it). I was so impressed at the cleaning quality that I just ordered a Roomba Scheduler from Amazon to do the vacuuming in between floor washes."
5,great job,"I have 2 Roombas - one for 7 years now - and love them. I just got the Scooba and LOVE it too! I does a great job. I let it go where it wants and does a very good job of getting everywhere in the room. It's lower than the Roomba, so it doesn't go over my area rugs (like the Roomba does). It also doesn't go over the saddles that are between rooms-which is fine for me.Some of my wood floors do not have a great seal anymore and actually have spaces between the planks. I was concerned about this since the Scooba specifically mentions these as problems. I do not have a problem at all! The floor is not soaking wet, full of puddles, so it does not drip down into the cracks.I have a dog and the Scooba does a great job of catching stray hairs that the Roomba may have missed.It is slightly louder and slower (it has more to do) than the Roomba.I will recommend the Scooba to everyone I know!"
1,very disappointed,"We're so disappointed in the Scooba. It did work well for about a year and then started running slower and slower. We've replaced the battery but it must be the charging unit itself that's defective. Now, it won't charge at all, is out of warranty and so is useless. We're returning the new battery but just have to throw the robot away. It seems incredible that such an expensive home appliance lasts for such a short time.We also found the Customer Support to be unsatisfactory. The Customer Support seemed to be employees reading from their manuals and were no help at all. The Technical Support was much better (especially a lady named Christine) but they can't make up for the product itself.We'll never buy another Scooba and tell our friends to avoid buying it as well. It was an overpriced headache once it developed problems."
3,Scooba,"Scoobs seems to clean well, but it does not dry as well as they say it will. I have to get on my knees with a towel to dry the floor."
3,Works great......but for only about a year!,"The Scooba works great. I have a large kitchen with ceramic tile. I would set up the Scooba about twice a week. It works awesome. It was even whitening my dull grout. The problem is that it only lasted about a year before it started to have mechanical problems. For this kind of money, I expected it to last much longer."
1,9 months of scooba,"i bought a romba and a scooba last december, 9 months ago. the romba is excellent. the scooba(s) is/are built-in obsolescence at best. the first one was replaced after about five months during which it had gone through only one complete cycle without interruption. the 2nd one has been better, but i'm presently waiting on a $58 battery because the other one only lasts about 5 minutes after a full charge. i wish it performed as intended but it hasn't for me after four consults from technical help line. sc"
2,Not sure about the Scooba,"I have a Roomba that I love so I thought the Scooba would continue to improve my life. Not so. Returned the first Scooba as it worked properly ONCE. The newest Scooba works but has a similar problem as the first as it picks up very little water from my floor. It lays down solution and scrubs around, but then I have to complete the job with a mop. Great idea, but the scooba is not worth the work."
3,"Cleans fine, but very slowly","We purchased the scooba to help us keep up with our two very messy boys. We have a fairly large kitchen, with a hardwood floor. The Scooba has a fairly small tank, so it cannot clean the whole kitchen in a single pass. We have to break the kitchen into two areas and do half at a time. The Scooba is not as fast or agile as the Roomba, so it cannot get around the chair and table legs very well. We have to move the chairs out of the kitchen to get it somewhat clean, and if we take the table out, it is very clean.It's still better than hand scrubbing, but you have to go and scrub the corners after the Scooba finishes, because it is too big to get close to the corners. So, if you have small areas or can easily break them up, Scooba is a good choice. You may want to purchase one or two electronic walls, because it only comes with one. If you have an open floor plan you will need it."
3,Good but could use a few improvements,"It works well when you use it often enough to keep your floors a consistent level of cleanliness. If they get too dirty, or have dried spills, the mop doesn't work as well and you may need to let it run more than once. It's a great feature that it picks up the dirty water, but i wish it were a bit better. The floors are consistently fairly damp. I had a hoover mop/vacuum that did a better job of squeegeeing, but then again, it ran on house current. The mop barely gets stuck, but unfortunately our stove is just at the right height. If the mop approaches it at the right angle, it gets stuck every time. It's frustrating...you'd think the mop could sense a tight squeeze clearance-wise and back off like it does with stairs."
1,Horrible,"I own a roomba and was looking forward to owning a scooba, but to my disappointment I could only find cons.-Leaks water from the side while running-Leaves water on the floor-Spilled water when tank was detachedI received it in my mail this afternoon. I have already printed out the return slip and packed it back up."
4,i robot scooba,"Seems to be okay, but has a tendency to skip some areas, and go over and over others."
2,Not ready for prime-time,"If I had written this review within the first month of owning a Scooba I would have given it a fairly high rating. However, over the course of two months, it's become troublesome. It no longer vacuums (I have to sweep first) and occasionally pours dirty water onto the floor, to boot. Little things trip it up -- a piece of Easter grass, for example -- and I'm finding the maintenance annoying. In the time it takes to clean out the machine -- removing the brush, et cetera -- I could easily run a Swiffer Wet Jet through the kitchen. This product has great potential, but I wish I had waited a year before purchasing it, giving the manufacturer time to work out the bugs. As I recall Roomba was bug-gy its first year. The manufacturer successfully repaired the bugs and the price dropped to less than half of what it debuted at. Give this one some time before purchasing -- I wish I had."
1,"No reliability, No quality control","One Scooba lasted 3 months, then it lasted less and less time, until it was finally only running for 2 minutes. I exchanged it for a new one. The new one never worked, it never put water on the floor. The next day, I exchanged the second one for a third new one. It also never worked, it never put water onto the floor. My Scooba then turned into a refund! I'll wait for the second generation when this product might actually have some reliability, hopefully."
5,Great book well writen,"I read this book translated in Dutch, but that didn,t harm. Even in Dutch it is a great novel from the begin to the end. Read it and have some laughs about this, quit dramastic, story."
3,Go Momma Go!,"I was expecting a comical masterpiece. After page one I slowly became dissapointed and realized I was not getting one. However, page one was the best, especially when the grandfather of the protagonist is ""riding the toilet""! This book would probably be admired more by male readers as it is a comming of age story about Thomas. It was enjoyable reading about the bond he and his grandfather had...as well as how the wife treats the father. Different. Actually, the term ""disfunctional family"" would discribe Thomas and his kin."
2,Missed opportunities,". Thomas Penham searches throughout the novel, for his grandfather's amazing collection of pornography, for the girl of his dreams, for the code word bluebells, finally for his place in the world. From explosions to bodily functions, dissolving marriages to World War I, Robinson has it all in this novel, yet there is a huge problem; I never once cared for any of these characters. From the dying grandfather to Thomas himself, a fairly repulsive twerp whom Robinson tries to save by giving him the soul of a poet, there was not one character here who brought about any kind of emotional response and reading about characters you don't care about is always a chore."
2,The Peculiar Memories of Thomas Penman,"This YA story is a mess. The premise of the story revolves around human and canine fecal matter and a dysfunctional boy and his family. While many reviews expound on the humorous aspects of the story I was unable to find anything funny about it, I think ""disgusting, pathetic and pitiful"" are a more appropriate description! The only redeeming qualities I found in this story is that it is well written and features well developed characters..."
3,A little too much excrement for me,"I hope no one takes offense at this, but I think you have to be a guy to truly enjoy this one (I'm not). There is just a little too much focus on bodily parts. Lots of times I felt that I was reading an inside joke, for men only. I can see that it's well written and sometimes funny and I am sure that some would find this absolutely wonderful. I just didn't. I really felt that I had just spent a lot of time with an obnoxious 12 year old boy. If that's your cup of tea, by all means, I recommend this book, but if you'd rather curl up with a cup of tea, read another book."
4,Good product hard to find,"I ordered this for my mother because she hates the reflective ones and she can't fold those cloth/springy ones to save her life! It arrived in perfect condition and you just can't find them anymore. I only have two minor gripes: The picture is a little off-center (I'm guessing these are leftovers since they don't make them anymore), but it's going to be faded in a few months anyway, so who cares; and the fact that I had to pay nearly half of the total cost in shipping (I ordered 3 and shipping was around $10)."
3,"Interesting, since my husband and I found the victim .....","The book is not a masterpiece by any means, but was interesting for me since my husband Todd Burdell and I are the ones that found the victim, Lynn. Imagine our horror when, after fishing at the lake, we try to put out a ""brush fire"" to be good samaritans, and wind up finding in the fire was a woman with her head gone... The author definitely took liberties with dialogue, since he never even asked us what we saw when we found her, or asked about our reactions. But I do believe he states this in the book that he was going to take liberties with certain conversations. Still think the book would have been better if he had interviewed some people in Litchfield where it happened!"

5,Great Item,This arrived on time. It's easy to use. The directions are clear and come with the package. This takes the guessing game out. I too was ovulating later than I thought. The lines are clear on the LH strips. Now I'm just waiting to use the pregnancy test! I would recommend this to any woman trying to get pregnant!
2,Combo pack from Formosa Med,"When I was buying this combo, I expected to receive a Early-pregnancy brand which works ok for me. However Formosa Med sent [...] brand that I do not like at all. The strips are so thin and even the control line never went dark. As a result, I have to guess even more if I ovulate or not yet. Both ovulation and pregnancy test packages look alike, very easily to be confused. Will not buy again and do not recommend."
4,Good but I do not Know how precise it is...,"They say the band has to be darker or at least the same intensity as the control band. In my case, the band appeared at the right time, was there for 2-3 days and I got my cycle after 2 weeks, which makes me believe that it was a LH surge, but the band never got as dark as the control band... Besides that, the test is very convenient and simple."
4,ovualtion and early PG tests,"These were a bit different to the test I was use to getting at the grocery store. You have to use a cup to do the tests, but I just kept a stack of disposable cups in the bathroom with the strips and it worked out fine. I did get PG with the ovualtion test!!!! Due in April!!!"
2,Not Worth Trying,"I've used two 50-pack Ovulation strips from the same store. Very good. Sharp images and very clear results. But this 20ov+5pg pack is not as good. Test line is too faint, foggy. Result line is faint even when positive. Very hard to tell the difference of two lines. Painful experence. I tried the 1st one, could not see the result well, used two, three, hoping the next one would give me a better result...In three days, used 11. Still no clear result. Don't buy this package."
3,So-so,"The ovulation test strips were a different matter, though. I kept trying and trying and bought a hundred more of these just so I could use them every single day of the month and not miss my ovulation days but they never did show a positive result. I did get pregnant later so obviously, I did ovulate - it just wasn't detected.For what it's worth, I also bought some more expensive ovulation test kits from my local drugstore (they cost $15 for a box of 7) and they never worked for me either so it could also be that my hormones never reached levels that were detectable by any kit - cheap or expensive.The pregnancy test strips worked fine for me, they were able to detect my pregnancy and show a positive result on day 1 of my missed period."
4,Ovulation test review,"These are OK, but I am not sure how reliable they are as compared to more expensive products. They are harder to use, because they are small."
3,Hard to read,I've been using the strips for over 3 months and I'm not sure I've been able to tell when I'm ovulating. The strip is hard to read. Maybe I'm just not doing it on the day I'm ovulating and haven't gotten a positive result yet. It is a good value for the money.
4,"Not received yet, but","I just wanted to specify that although it says here ""Free Same-Day Shipping"", that only means they send it out that day, not that the speed of delivery is any quicker. Since they send it USPS, there is no tracking number.The only reason I'm concerned about this is that I live outside the states and use a forwarder, and if I don't have a tracking number I can't make any questions about the package."
2,Not reliable,"Nowhere was it mentioned, when I ordered the product, that it was made in China. Anyway, I have been using similar products from Early Pregnancy Tests (made in Canada) and they're very reliable (got pregnant twice in 1 year using them). I wanted to try those cheaper ones, so I used them in parallel with the Canadian product to compare. They did not always give similar results. I had an ultrasound done today at the doctor's office and got a shot to make ovulation occur in the next 24 to 36 hours, so I came home and used both products out of curiosity. The Canadian product gave a positive result (it should be!!!) and the Chinese one was negative.Also, be careful, as some sellers use the sentence Early Pregnancy Test to refer to their pregnancy tests, and this is how I was mislead, since Early Pregnancy Tests is also a brand (ovulation kits, pregnancy kits, and other products). Hope this helps!"
4,They worked for me,"The test line never did get darker than the control line for me, but it did get AS dark. When they were negative, there was an obvious difference (very light test line). These really helped us not to miss my ovulation, and I got pregnant our first cycle using them."
5,Good Buy,This shipped fast and came in a vanilla envelope so no body knew what your business was. I tried them for the month and I'm planning on continuing them to monitar my ovulation cycle.
1,Unaccurate Tests,I am a Medical Technologist that reads Laboratory tests for a living. I would not recommend these tests. The test line never went darker then the control line. I ran this test along with tests (the ones made to hold directly in the urinestream)from CVS and Clearblue Easy both of those consistently resulted as positive at the right times.If you are serious about accurately detecting your surge i would recommend not investing in this product. The slightly more expensive tests made to hold directly in the urinestream (which I believe this company also sells but I personally have not tried) seem to be a better more accurate investment.
1,Still ended up buying store test,"Took preg test two days before I was supposed to start and got a negative so I thought I was about to start my period. Didn't start so I took anothe rone the next day and got an incredibly faint line, I mean I thought I was seeing things so the next day I went and bought an EPT and it came back with a very DARK POSITIVE! Won't buy these again. Never got to use the Ovulation sticks but I assume they are the same."
4,Works great,"The site states that it's free same day shipping, but I was charged for shipping. It wasn't enough to keep me from purchasing it, but it still bothers me. It did get to me rather quickly.The tests work great. Right when I believe I was ovulating, I got a positive reading on the test. And it was darker than the control line. The first month trying, I got a positive pregnancy test as well :)A name brand test did give me a darker line on the same day, but both were definitely positive - about 5 days before my missed period."
5,Get your blood pumping,"This book contains scary stories by the masters of horror. Poe's ""The Black Cat"" is both grusome and horrifying. ""Mrs. Amworth"" contains a truly terribly thought: a face seen in the window of a second story room. You are not safe anywhere from that vampire woman. ""The Monkey's Paw"" is an old favorite. ""Where Angels Fear"" is scary to children and adults alike. There are many other chills from the writers of classic gothic horror. Try them all out around a roaring campfire, but don't sleep alone afterwards................"
4,My Favorite Super Hero Speaks,"I remember watching Batman when it originally came on TV in the late 60's. I loved everything about it: the fight scenes, the gadgets, the Bat Cave, the little 'pearls of wisdom' scattered throughout the shows. In particular, I was a big fan of Batman. When I read this book, it was a pleasant surprise to see that the actor who played Batman seemed to have a personality similar to the character he played. I enjoyed reading about Adam West's life before the show, the many exciting, stressful, fun, and memorable things that happened during the show, and Adam's life after the show ended. The only thing that disappointed me was how quickly the last chapter ended. It would down rather quickly, without going in to a lot of details about the past few years. However, I reckon that is ok, because the book is titled 'Back to the Batcave'. Also, a few more photos would have been nice.Bottom line: I really enjoyed this book. It is a must for any fan of the original Batman TV show."
4,A book that should have been written earlier!!,"It is enjoyable for me to read the story of my childhood hero. I watched the reruns of the show during the 1970's. Adam gives us a behind the scenes look of Batman, info about the guest villians, and how playing Batman has affected him. This like Burt Ward's book and Yvonne Craig's are a must for batfans & the batmania collector."
4,Much better than the previous versions,"I found this to be much better than the previous versions. I feel that it was more at an appropriate level for the age and the characters/graphics were nicer. My four and a half year old daughter is really enjoying it, and not getting as frustrated as she did in earlier versions because the content was too advanced. Plus, it is simply more fun. My only complaint is I feel they can provide a few more options of activities, but that is my only constructive complaint."
1,Watch out!,"Don't rely on the picture posted! The box is WRONT - this is another JS Adv K... this is NOT what is listed (and my son wanted) - had to return and given a bit of a hard time with calling, etc. Stay away!"
1,I also encountered problems,I second the review about this product's failure. I have Microsoft XP and have had technical problems with this product. I've yet to hear back from their technical support team regarding this.
1,Don't buy if using kindle/iPad,"Diagrams are not viewable on kindle/iPad. Without the diagrams, the book is useless. No point buying for kindle unless this issue is fixed."
1,Kindle version diagrams are unreadable !!!!,"I don't understand how Amazon can put such an unreadable version of this book on kindle library. it's not a matter of zooming, the image and diagrams are badly scanned so, even if zooming, they are impossible to read !!! I want money back !!!"
1,Pictures,The writing inside the pictures were completely blurry. Lots of pictures with lots of information in them. Unreadable. Extremely disappointed.
4,Premium plug at rock bottom price,"replaced the plugs at 200,000 on my 1999 infiniti q45t (second set). very well constructed and by far the cheapest price in town (more than half off from local auto parts stores and free delivery and no sales tax - gotta love amazon!)"
3,Good plug but go with the laser iridium suspect durability,"Amazon doesn't sell this plug for my Subaru. I'm putting it here as a public service. I had four of these in my Subaru for 50000 miles. They worked fine. Except one had the whole corner of the ground electrode shear off. I don't know if it's still in the cylinder or not, but the whole corner is cleanly gone. Overall, there's not much wear on the ground electrode. The spark was grounding almost on the side of the electrode after that part of the electrode sheared off. Not good. And I still wonder if I don't need to stick a magnet on a stick down the spark plug hole and try to get that piece back.Anyway, the laser iridium probably solves this as the ground electrode has a platinum disk on it."
1,WARNING TO SUBARU OWNERS,"Amazon stated this plug worked with my 05 legacy gt limited. It in fact does not. The plug here is meant for the non-turbo'd 2.0 motor not the 2.5 turbo. You can imagine the trouble this could cause.Had to have the car towed to the dealer after the motor began to run poorly, heading to a stall in drive and shutter while in park. Dealer said no long term damage was done but that it could have been much worse.Likely no fault of the NGK plug but Amazon's system for getting it wrong. Either way I am leaving this as a 1 star in hope that people searching will wonder why 1 star and save themselves the expensive troubles I faced. While Amazon covered the cost of getting my car fixed and inspected at the dealer, I see 2-3 weeks later their system still says it works. Dealer made it very clear these plugs were wrong and showed me the difference. It's visible. We spend about 10K/year on Amazon but I will likely not get auto parts again. Was my first time."
3,A nice look at the World Series of Poker . . . 20 Years Ago,"Written nearly 20 years ago, Alvarez focuses mostly on the personalities that made up the early years of the World Series of Poker, the Binions, David Sklansky, Doyle Brunson, Stu Unger and many others. He gives their personal histories and repeats anecdotes that help explain them. He also gives a decent profile of Vegas itself and the many regional poker masters from around the world who come to Vegas to lose all their money."
4,A Classic Poker Read,"This book is a must have for the serious poker library. While many of the poker players that Alvarez writes about in the book have now become household names, they were virtual unknowns (outside of their peers) when he wrote this book. This book really was groundbreaking in many ways.Reading this book will enable you to appreciate the mentality of the hi-limit players before poker became mainstream and commercialized. If you want to appreciate a little more about the history of the World Series of Poker, this is a good place to start. The event was not always the ""circus"" that it has become today.Alvarez has a nice writing style that is entertaining and easy to read. This is a quick read that you can get through in a few hours. I recommend it."
1,Don't order this from Amazon! Worst experience,"The product is decent, but don't order this from Amazon...They listed this as 3 to 5 weeks, but expect more like 3 to 5 months (if that soon at all). I've ordered March 30, it's June 14 and I just got another notice of delay (I never received the first delay notice... I had to call and ask what the hell happened to my order).Customer service sucks as well. They upgraded my shipping twice, but what the hell is the use? They are clueless as to when it's going to come, and I don't think they really care that this order it totally fu*ked."
3,"If buying from Adorama, be aware",Bought this set through Adorama last week. The $2 shipping cost was a relief and it actually arrived the same day as the rest of my order placed using 2nd day. When I opened the package I was surprised though. My Sunpak twin pack consisted of a Tiffen UV and CP filter. The Adorama invoice even reflects that the above Sunpak kit is made up of the 2 Tiffen filters.I have contacted Adorama and will be updating this review based on my results.
2,The Hits AND The Misses from April Wine,"I don't know what Myles and the boys were thinkin' on this one. Maybe I am not the typical April Wine fan. With 19 songs, there should be more than 5 really good tracks, don't you think? Well, there's not. You get Say Hello, Enough Is Enough, Just Between You And Me, Roller (great tune) and Sign Of The Gypsy Queen.What happened to all the other good stuff from First Glance and Nature Of The Beast? Or even from Harder...Faster? Make your own mix from these three albums and Power Play. This release is too light on the hard stuff and good stuff from the boys from Canada."
5,the best cd i have,"i have over 800 cd's and 400 albums and this cd is one of the best.it has song after song that i like.i just can't play it enough of ""TELL ME WHY-YOU WON'T DANCE WITH ME-LOVE HAS REMEMBERED ME"""
1,"Band is in crisis but has contractual obligations, I guess..","Not much good I can say about this one. It only has one song I would put on a hit compilation - ""Rock Myself To Sleep"" - and only if it were a double CD compilation and had enough room for everything else. Simply don't buy it unless you are a hardcore fan and want to have everything by AW."
5,Messages contained within,I've had the opportunity to read this book from cover to cover. When I first picked it up I thought ok this is another one of the boring books that I'll read maybe one or two pages put it down and walk away. Instead the book grabbed at me and keep my attention to the everyday trials that we go through. I thank god for the opportunity to read such a blessed book.
5,Best hand cream out there!,"This lotion is AMAZING! Seriously, my friend got me hooked on H2O products and this is one of my favorite things there (besides the eye cream). It has a really nice scent, but the best thing is that it works and your hands don't feel greasy at all. I get super dry skin in the winter, and this stuff works and absorbs fast. I'd recommend this to anybody. I don't use it as a nail cream, but if you want something to make your hands smooth and soft without feeling slimy or icky - this is what you want."
2,"Liked Product, but wrong color- Couldn't return item","I bought this product for my mom, but the color was the wrong color red. I tried to return the item, but the company told me to ask amazon for a tracking number and Amazon did not reply twice for my requests of a tracking number.So this is to say amazon failed in replying to my requests and I have been unable to return this item."
2,Disappointed,The information contained in this book is very general. More thorough and detailed information can be found in any basic book on cockatiels. There is only one picture of baby birds in a nest and one picture of a wooden nestbox. All of the other pictures are of adult birds. The books also lacks any pictures or diagrams on the proper technique for hand feeding babies. Information is rather vague in most areas. None of the illnesses or problems associated with hand-feeding are even mentioned. The only merit this book has is its low price.
5,very good effort,"After many years of silence, Tasmin is back with ""On"", which is such a surprise; it's a very good album, and some tracks (""Take care"", ""Effect is monotony"", ""Violence"", ""Hello"", ""Complaints"") are excellent songs; I love Tasmin's voice, and I think she is a very talented artist; I think ""Bloom"" is her best album to date, but ""On"" is very close to the top."
2,National Enquirer in paperback form,"Although written on the level of the National Enquirer, that is dumbed down for even the simplest minds to understand, this book nevertheless takes us into a world few of us seldom encounter: the sideshow freaks. Thankfully that era of human exploitation is almost gone now (except maybe for the ersatz sideshows at Coney Island), but this book gives us a human side to these people wrapped around a saddening murder story. There are worse ways to spend a few mindless hours than reading this book."
3,You'll want to take a shower after reading this book.,"After reading ""Lobster Boy,"" the story of the murder of sideshow attraction Grady Stiles, I now understand why people can't turn away from a nasty auto accident: morbid fascination compels them to stare. The same is true for this book. I always felt a little strange and dirty after visiting a circus sideshow and that same feeling returned while reading this book. Rosen reveals a side to life that few people understand or have experienced. It's different and who's to say it's worse than what we know? Regardless, all the details are here for us to gawk at, like circus attraction. Although it suffers from weak writing, the story is gripping and you just can't turn away until it's over. Entertaining in a sleazy way."
5,Excellent Combo,"I'm really proud of adquiring all these products for my Olympus Digital Camera, I have everything that I need, I never go out of memory or battery, so don't think about it and and buy this Kit."
2,Beware!,"Sadly, this is a beautifully designed and well-made mailbox that comes with no mounting hardware. It's impossible to attach to the wall without appropriate hardware."
1,Two attempts and Still no working HD,Second attempt to get a working HD replacement. First attempt it burns right in my PC.Amazon make a replacement but now the connector is wrong. So now I have 2 HD's in my possesion and neither of which will work in my system.Very frustrating.
3,The currently best (wish it could be better) for teaching.,"I used Matthew Harris' ""21-day"" book to teach VBA during Spring '99 quarter at South Puget Sound Community College. It is not really made for the classroom (no CD-ROM, instructor must make up his own quizes, etc.), but generally good in the first two thirds of the book. The last few chapters begin to falter, however: #19 does not treat Automation (OLE) too clearly nor explain certain oddities (e.g., unexpected 'recursion' when linking an Excel file to Word). Also, a promise of showing how to use Windows' own FileOpen screens in Chapter 20 is never fulfilled. Chapter 21 is a poorly-coordinated grabbag of leftovers not presented well. Still, the book is probably the best in this poorly covered market. Although it treats of Word and Excel only, with over 1,000 pages it is a fairly good introduction to the subject."
3,If you're a beginner - buy this book.,"If you're new to programming, this book delivers. Good coverage of important basics. Line by line hand holding on example code provided. Clear explanations. An excellent beginner's book. Not that good for intermediate or advanced levels. Its still a good reference, but advanced topics aren't covered."
3,This book is worth only for beginner on Word and Excel,"I only rated this book at 3 because of 2 points. First,the book mainly use Word and Excel for examples and the book cover list include Access, Outlook and Project as well. I know it is nearly impossible to cover all these (particularly Access)in a 21 days book. So do not put them on the front cover. Second, if you are experienced VB programmer, you might only read the second half of the book."
4,...nice set of early JW westerns . In B/W,The Duke was a handsome one and it's good to see many of his earlier western films. This is a fine 4 DVD set.Nothing wrong with the content but I bought this used and saw a number offingerprints. Why do people have to leave their greasy fingerprints on DVD/CD's?This is my first online used DVD purchase from Amazon.
4,Good book,"I bought the book for the recipes and have not been disappointed. They are great. Not altogether practical on a daily basis, but fun to experiment with."
3,Removing Wheat From Your Diet,"After watching so many ""healthy living shows"" I decided to try a cook book that offered wheat free menus. It is taking some getting use to the taste and texture of foods but we're getting there. One noticeable change...allergy attacks are less frequent. BUT I am making sure it not just ""in my mind"" but in my diet befoe I sing it's praises. But I have things that we enjoy in the book."
2,too many starches for a diabetic,"I bought this because of a gluten problem, but it has way too many starches for a diabetic. I will not be able to use many of these recipes."
1,Misleading title,"What a disappointment. Despite the title this is just one of the plethora of gluten-free recipe collections.If you simply need to eliminate wheat from your diet, not necessarily give up all gluten, this is NOT the right choice."
4,HealthyLiving.,"I like the book just haven't had it long enough to really use it , I think I did buy it for my daughter's birthday which is soon.If one is going Wheat /Gluten free you sure need this book."
3,Good for true wheat allergies,"I am a simple cook. I do not like recipes that require more than a couple of steps. Some of the recipes would require me to shop out of town, as living in a more rural area some things are not available here."
3,Disappointed,"I received this book as a gift from a friend. After trying many recipes in this book, it leaves me scratching my head. I have tried the desserts and came out with horrible results, I tried some a the entrees and found that they require major tweaking in some cases. The one recipe I thought would turn out wonderfully did not. The rice that was supposed to be done in thirty minutes never got done, even after 2 hours of cooking (it was as though the rice didn't want to cook!)! I was highly disappointed and a tad discouraged, since it was my first wheat free cook book I guess I had too many grandiose ideas. Will continue to try recipes and hope for the best!"
2,not sure,"I also accidentally ordered two of the receipe books and sent one back. Just received the second one and will return that also. I did make a few receipes from the first book I received that I decided to keep, however, they were okay - not great, but okay."
4,AWESOME INFO!!!,"Wow, I feel like I have been living in the dark ages until I learned about all these wonderful methods and products to prepare gluten -free foods!!!This info is a tremendous eye-opener!Thank you so much and I hope to see more books on this topic!Keep up the great work Carol Fenster! ...you ROCK!PS: We would also love to see some healthier sweetening options presented, other than white sugar..."
2,"Great idea, bad follow thru","I was really looking forward to this book and thought the recipes sounded great and then I began to test them, several were so bad I just tossed in the garbage because I couldn't eat it. I found very few recipes I really liked. I am so upset because I only have one Gluten free cookbook and this was it."
4,"Great compilation, bad mixes","I've been waiting for this greatest hits since tha late nineteens, the selection is great but the second disc, wich i thoug would be great is actually very averge with performances in all the songs, except for the last track wich is by tha way the only one garbage did."
4,A good compilation of hits...,This would be five stars except Androgyny is not included except on the mix CD. Otherwise an excellent addition for anyone wanting to have a chronology of Garbage and an idea of how they have evolved over the years.
3,greatest hits,"the only songs i put on my computer was Only Happy When It Rains, Stupid Girl, and I Think I'm Paranoid."
5,I am very happy!,"I felt like I no more and ordered my CD and was already listening to it! I work full time and have children so I never have time (or money) to shop, so this fast and inexpensive venue is the way to shop! Seller was fast, CD was perfect. Thanks a mill!!"
3,"good collection, so so bonus disc","the remastered sound and collection of essential songs from the first 2 garbage albums alone make this worthwhile. however, it is skimpy on 'beautifulgarbage' material (""androgyny"" anyone?), and drops at least one if not 2 worthy inclusions from 'bleed like me.' the garbage mixes disc would be killer had they not edited almost every mix from its original length. the version of ""#1 crush"" on disc 1 is from 'romeo + juliet,' which is the nellee hooper remix. the original (from 'subhuman [""vow""]') is still a stray b-side. one day there will almost inevitably be remastered versions of the garbage albums, hopefully with a pertinent bonus disc with the full versions of the remixes from each album as well as matching b-sides, if not a garbage b-side collection unto itself. until then, this is the most up to date mastering of the songs included, shame the songs on disc 2 are edited, it could have been ""absolute."""
2,Awful sound,Don't get me wrong: this compilation is a good selection from their music and the remixes second disc is quite interesting.So where's the problem: I don't like how this CD sounds. The volume level is very high and even if there's no obvious distortion the music doesn't sounds clear.I'm not a Garbage fanboy but I think I know how their music should sound. I mean I think this edition is bad remastered and it's prioritized the loud and the 'make noise' effect over the detail.Or maybe I'm wrong and this CD sounds like it should be...
5,Absolutely Absolute!,This cd is worth it for the track It's all Over but the Crying. Such a powerful and emotional song that had me in tears the first few times. Garbage continues to impress me no matter what they do. Shirley Manson is a goddess in heavy eyeliner
4,It will Speak To you.,"Michael Redhill came to Newfoundland, for the March Hare writers weekend last year. He is such a great story teller, and I haven't read or even heard his name before. I listened closely, as he told a story from Fidelity. His voice was so smooth, and relaxing. I picked up Fidelity soon after,and was blown away by the honesty, and the way Redhill really captures different relationships. It was a great, easy read, but deep on many levels. This is a great book, which leaves you with something to think about, long after the last page."
4,Great for intermediate tv techs...,"The book gives an overall view of how today's tv's work and how to find most faults. Alot of the troubleshooting tips are a little too general in their explanations and constantly refer you to the tv's Photofact or schematic, which is kind of annoying. But I did find myself learning quite a bit. I've only been into tv repair for a year and I found the book to be fairly chanlleging, but left me wanting more-which I guess is a good thing.The book is broken down by circuit types- video, power supply, high voltage...etc. Also, there's a section devoted to helping you read and follow the various schematics which is very helpful.Overall, very good book...just a tad bit too general in detail."
5,Pretty much the complete Kane Gang--both albums and then some,"This obscure 80s band with a mellow alternative rock sound only had two full length albums, and this two disc set includes all the tracks from both albums, plus what I imagine are b-sides from singles. The only thing really missing are the 12"" versions of some of the singles, simply because the 2 discs couldn't have fit them. Track listing:CD11. brother brother2. gun law3. we'll take this train4. how much longer5. loserville6. printer's devil7. respect yourself8. closest thing to heaven9. smalltown creed10. crease in the hat11. it's a gift12. angel on a motorbike13. six o'clock cityCD21. motortown2. what time is it3. looking for gold4. take me to the world5. king street rain6. don't look any further7. a finer place8. let's get wet9. strictly love10. sitting ducks11. king of nothing12. love thing13. lonesome weary and blue14. star walking15. brightest star"
4,GREATNESS UNDISCOVERED,"KANE GANG,well what can you say about a cd that didnt really get its cumupance when it was released.This is a great cd and fans know this but if your a new comer to this group try it and you will be surprised by the "" blue eyed soul "" before lidell-astley and jon b...!"
1,Loved it but didn't work very long,"I actually did love this while it was working.My head is in the clouds a lot so to have a timerthat I could just hang around my neck was veryhandy so I wouldn't stay lost in a project. Itdid have a loud tick which would have been nicequieter but for the price...heh? Anyway, I reallyenjoyed it and used it a lot but after a couple ofmonths it stopped working.I would definitely pay more for something similiarthat I could wear around my neck, was quieter andhad a softer or adjustable ring...and that would last. :)"
1,Polder? I think NOT!!!!!,Most Polder stuff is great! This wouldn't work right out of the packaging. I sent it back on principle. Just kept ticking and never dinged...so much for my daughter's time out.
1,poorly and thoughtlessly made,"The timing function and the bell work . BUT drop it , even on carpet, and it breaks apart into at least 3 pieces . And it will fall even if you don't drop it because the magnet that is supposed to hold it to the fridge , etc. when not around your neck , is so weak that it tends to slide right down the appliance and crash to the floor .In addition --or maybe subtraction -- the cord that is supposed to hold it around your neck is super scratchy so you won't want it next to your skin . Another junky thing made to look nice and functional but made so thoughtlessly and cheaply that it is nothing but a waste of money ."
1,A good concept; it would be nice if the timer worked,"I needed a new kitchen timer and liked that this one was fitted with both a magnet and a strap. Unfortunately, the timer never worked. Either it didn't go off when it was supposed to, or it went off and then wouldn't stop ticking. The timer appears to have been very cheaply made. Not recommended."
3,mixed reviews,"The timer works fine and it's a great idea to have one you can wear so it goes off where you can hear it... even if you have wandered into another room. However the magnet on the back is not strong so when i stick it on the fridge it tends to slide slowly down hill, or even fall off with a brisk closing of the fridge door."
2,poorly designed and poorly made,"I purchased this timer because it can be worn around the neck. If you do that and look at the timer, the dial is upside down. Not a huge problem, but poor design, and the timer is too large to wear conveniently around the neck. The black minute ring is made of paper. Mine started peeling off almost immediately."
1,Don't waste your money,"As usual buy at least a few above the cheapest. This doesn't usually have enough energy in the spring to get it all the way to the alarm ring sound - so you set it and then it gets down to about the minute mark and then nothing, stops. Useless. [...] bucks out the window."
4,$5.50 for lanyard,"My oven does do timed cooking but it shuts off at the end of the cook time and sometimes I need a few minutes. I probably will wear this around my neck. Because this has a magnet, I keep this on the fridge and have had no problem using it every time I have needed it since receiving it. I recommend this product."
5,A great way to prevent a fire!,I purchased this for my mother who has melted more than one pan on her stove and has collection pot and pans with delaminated bottoms. She finds this timer very easy to set and very good at waking her when she wears it around her neck.
1,Broke 3 days after I got it,"The timer is a great idea. You can take it wherever you are going. The magnet on the back also stuck to my file cabinet in the office which was a great plus. However, after a great start, it broke three days after I received it. I was really disappointed."
1,Didn't work,Timer never worked right out of the package. Followed directions explicitly to no avail. Threw timer out as cost to return wasn't worth it. A bummer! A one star is overly generous.
1,Garbage,"I saw the many reviews saying this thing does not work, but I figured that they couldn't all be defective, and maybe I would be fortunate enough to receive one that did. I was wrong. It does not ring. Almost not worth the trouble to return it, but I figure if Amazon loses enough money shipping these back and forth, they will hopefully find a timer that does in fact work, and offer that mythical product."
2,doesn't work much,"I have had a few of these. I love the idea & design, a really handy thing to have. The first couple stopped working after a while so I replaced them, the 2 new ones I got just plain don't work from the get go, they'll start ticking then just stop a minute later. Too bad."
3,medium sized toy,I bought this toy over a year ago for our Maltese puppy. She likes to hold toys in her mouth and shake them as if it was a small dead animal. I thought she'd love this one because of the cloth material at either end. The ball is light weight but still has enough mass to let the toy fling if she were to play with it that way. She liked the toy and was interested but doesn't play on her own with it. She will play tug of war with it and run after it if we play with her though.
2,A Dud Among Pigeons,"I thought it was drawn out way too much. A simple idea that could have been effective becomes indulgent with too many talking-head characters in the beginning who don't really have anything to do with the plot. Plus they are poorly played.The two main actors are really good, but they talked and talked and talked. Way too much dialogue, it would have been far more effective cut in half.One close shot of the man's feet walking along toward the beginning of the film really annoyed me because we can clearly see he is walking in place. Why include that shot since it is not really needed and it instantly kills any believability?The decision to make ADAP in black and white also annoyed me because it's like a sign saying ""this is an important film."" But unless there is a legitimate story reason -- like The Artist for instance, because it needed to look like a silent film -- doing so always strikes me as a pretentious decision on the part of film makers."
4,A rare gem,"ADAP is a unique, one of a kind film with a great cast, Filmed in Visalia California. Make sure to watch what happens after the credits for a shocking ending."
4,A fun 20 minutes!,"This quirky film has a good lesson. Excellent performances by David Stay and Susan Matthews. The film has a slow start but the pay off is well worth it. I recommend checking this out, especially if you're into artistic visions and creative ""outside the box"" storytelling. Plus, make sure you stick around after the credits for some fun stuff...."
4,Beatles Big Beat Box,"As a collector of all things Beatles, I realise that I am very forgiving when it comes to my acceptance of poor quality images when they are very rare. Although in this case the images are not too bad, allowances were made because I am simply thrilled that this material has been made available. It is almost like being on the road with The Fab Four in their hay day. I have bought three copies two for my best friend and my cousin who are also fans. The CD which comes with the film is a great bonus as it includes a recording of a track Lennon never actually finished. The lyricks were found after his death and the track was comissioned and recorded by The Overtures. What a fantastic job they have done. Well done and thanks for this wonderfull piece of Beatles Memorabilia."
1,Misrepresented,The product was listed as hardcover. I was sent a board book. Beware. This is the second time amazon has misrepresented a children's book I purchased.
5,"Another great ""Over in the..."" book!","Our daughter is now 22 months old, and loves all the books in this series. The artwork is beautiful, and is noteworthy because it is actually pictures of scenes that the authors created out of polymer clay. So, when you see the seahorses on the cover of the book, that's a photo of a scene created out of clay. The level of detail is simply remarkable, and the artwork is creative and entertaining for both children and adults.The books also lay the groundwork for counting, but not in an overtly 'teaching' way, but simply as part of cute rhymes and logical progressions of the pages.This book (and all the 'Over in the...' series) are perennial favorites, and our daughter stays engaged from cover to cover virtually every reading, which is the ultimate compliment from her."
4,"Great pictures, very creative, little one's favorite","Over in the Ocean: In a Coral ReefThis is a great gift for baby shower, or first birthday - kids love this sing songy book with great illustrations. So good that I also ordered'Over in the Jungle'."
5,Such a cute book!,"My Mom bought this book for my 13 month old son a few days ago. He LOVES this book! We've read it every day, several times a day since then. It's very well written and illustrated and I love that it teaches him to count and find things. We love this book so much; we're buying Over in the Jungle."
2,Head Splitting,"Clark's novel is a dramatic failure of literature and artistry.What isn't contrived, misogynistic, or overindulged verbalacrobatics, is a plot line that fails to pull the readerforward, and characters that are hard for readers to care about.The concern in the work is not to tell a good story, but to display an intellectual prowess that is neither interestingor useful in the novel."
5,Excellent book once again!,"I really liked this book alot it kept you on your toes as to wether or not things were going to happen or not, I was shocked to read how cam turned out in the end, he is not the same character that I came to know and love in the Saddle Club books Horse Show and some other ones especially the one about Caroles birthday party. I am glad that Carole had enough common sense to tell him to back off and wait and it took alot of guts to tell him how she really felt about moving that fast in their relationship! I appulade that! Ms Bryant is really covering the issues that teens are going through today and how it is okay to deal with them, all except stevie though, I don't know about dressing a boy up in a blonde wig to save a best friend! Some moms just might not understand that one!! Ha! All in all a great book!"
5,great,"this book was a really good pine hollow book. There were more horses in it all and all, and i think that it is well written. The ending makes me desprate for number 16 to come out, a real cliff hanger! Kinda spooky too. I think that you could see what was going to happen between cam and carole when he was being mad at maxie at the wedding, i would have told him to stuff it then and there. I feel bad for carole though. Its hard to believe that cam has changed so much between The Saddle Club and Pine Hollow. I liked Ben better anyways. Hope you all enjoy it"
4,Setting the Pace,"Experiencing teenage anguish is something most people can identify with - or at least remember. In the newest book in the Pine Hollow series by Bonnie Bryant, titled Setting the Pace, four best friends, Lisa, Carole, Stevie and Callie, struggle through slightly cliche but very engaging problems. Lisa faces moving halfway through her senior year; Carole has a boyfriend pressuring her to go farther physically then she wants; Stevie is training for a horse race; and Callie is haunted by a stalker. All these problems weave around their daily life struggles at school, home and at the stable they all ride at. By weaving many plots together, Bryant effectively holds a reader's interest throughout the entire novel. Any person struggling with ther own problems can take a step away into the happily-ever-after complicated lives of the friends, and walk away with a brighter moral and encouraging perspective."
5,Pine Hollow Setting the Pace,"I Luved this book!!!!!!! It was great. I'm so glad that Lisa's mom decided not to go through with the move. I'm concerned with Cam and Carole's breakup. Now what's going to happen? As for the George thing I think he should just get a life, he is so close to stalking Callie."
3,Not Duras' best but enjoyable.,"This memoir depends upon three threads: first, the first summer together for Yann and Marguerite; second, the relationship between a 6 year old boy and his camp counsellor; third, a story woven by the counsellor of a boy and a shark. The first thread is vintage Duras - much meaning packed into spare language. The second thread has puzzling discrepancies - the boy, 6 in 1980 saw his younger sister killed by a German soldier; his sister's name is either Judith or Maria (a Jewish-Christian dichotomy?). This tread succeeds in exploring the role of being Jews and of age differentials for Yann and Marguarite. The third strand attempts to add a mythic layer to the story. However, the story is too sparse, too pedestrian, too poor a tale to fulfil the role.I recommend the book to fans of Duras but would suggest there are better works to serve as an introduction."
3,Stunning Imagery,"Yann Andrea Steiner is a difficult read but rewarding. Some of the images she presents are very beautiful. The blanks in her writing and especially in this novel creates a grey, dreamlike atmosphere. This book should be read on a rainy winter afternoon."
1,Too much even for a Duras fan.,"I'd have to agree with the synopsis, I couldn't help feeling that if I was heavily into the bottle I might find the fable that fills too much of this book more interesting. Too much time is spent whilst reading wishing that Duras would concentrate on other things, her relationship with Yann for starters instead of skirting the issue. If she didn't want it to be personal why write it?"
3,Does it's job.,"I can't decide if it's the polarizing filter or the lens itself, but it seems like I don't get as blue skies as I usually do with my other filters for my smaller lens. Weird. It does help with glare and reflection in water/glass though. It's fine. Nothing to get excited about, really."
2,Threading problems,"This filter would only partially screw onto my Panasonic camcorder and seat in a slight angle. It would not attach firmly and completely to the camcorder lens, though the threads appeared in good condition. To find if the threading problem was related to the camcorder lens or to the filter, I borrowed a Hoya from another camcorder. The Hoya seated perfectly, indicating that the problem was likely due to the defect in the filter threads.The filter came in a clear plastic storage case. The appearance of the packaging suggested possibly long time storage and rough handling. The tray housing the filter did not fit the size of the filter, allowing the filter to move freely inside the storage case."
2,The Urbz: Sims hit the floor,"Oh goodness. This was a big disapointment of the sims games. The graphics are very sad. This is a DS for crying out loud! They could do better. Making relationships with other citizens is very boring. The Women like to talk about fashion and money, and the guys like to talk about sports and cars. This requires hit the ""a"" but repeatedly over & over until you cant take it anymore. There are some fun mini games, but you don't really have a job. If you come across this game, leave it there. However, if you are a really good fan of the series, you should pick it up anyways. The Urbz: The Sims made a fluke..."
3,"good, but basically the same as the gameboy advance version","I loved this game on the gameboy sp, so I assumed it would be bumped up a couple notches for the high-powered DS version. Truth is, it is really the same game with the same graphics. Does not tap into the power of the Nintendo DS at all. The only tangible advantage is you get the dual screen action...other than that it is the same game."
3,Fun but buggy,"I've had fun playing this game but it's a bit tedious and has too many bugs. One of the rep goals can not be completed because of the bug with the trashpiles. The pet show game freezes my DS everytime my pet is the winner. But worst of all there is a bug near the end of the game. For some the bug at the end makes the game lock up but for others like me it won't let their pet through and electric fence.Now I have to stop playing or start a new URB. I've NEVER had a gameboy game with bugs in it and I've been playing them since the original system came out. I've come to expect excellent quaility from Nitendo and Nintendo Licensed games, but this game disappoints."
3,Hi,I got this game the same time I got my DS. It was a little boring because if you peed on the ground you would go to jail. you hve to buy everything. you would pass out if you dont eat food. over all it was a fritty fun game.
2,I got played,It's a Sims game but barely. It's hard to get past the 90s of it all. The graphics are what I expected but I wasn't into the game play.
4,It's a good game.,"This game is great, but when I purchased it I paid for a DS game and when I recived it in the mail it was a GBA game. I still enjoyed it, but it wasn't what I expected."
4,Lots of Fun!,"I think this is a great game. It has a wide variety of missions, a big world to walk arund (well run around), a lot of characters, lots of mini games/jobs, lots of items to collect/unlock etc.My only complaint is the motives or needs the character has. Although i realy like the game Sims on PC, i have always hated how quickly they get hungry, tired, need shower, use the bathroom etc. It seems like it's worse with this game. I tried to get this cool device (i forgot its name) from the ""Richies"" that fills all your motives at once and after that the game was much more fun. If i hadn't had that device, i think i'd have stopped playing it without bothering to finish the game.Highly recommended."
2,NOT A SIMS GAME!,"I'll be the first to admit, the marketing got me. I thought this game was a Sims equivelent, and unfortunatly I was wrong. This game, as innovative as it is, is just not fun. You are a character who has gotten kicked out of the building that you were working for and are forced to make a living on the streets. You work your way to the top so you can stop this evil scheme. Wow.. that sounds like fun? This game just wasn't for me. Like any Sims-type game, you have those stats (bathroom, hygeine, sleep), and they go down far to quickly, you just don't have time to enjoy anything. I'm sorry, but this wasn't a good game. I would definitly not reccomend it."
3,"Good for syntax, bad for ""Using Java""","This book has an excellent first few chapters. It really introduces the Java language, explains how it works, and makes it fairly easy to keep up. Once you start getting into the technologies that surround Java, such as database connections and CORBA, this book gets tough to follow. There is code example after code example with little or no explanation of what the code is doing step by step. I know that I like when the author walks me through code so I can understand the first time, and not have to look at more examples. This book does not do that. Overall I think there is material to be learned from this book, though I'm not sure if it's easily extracted. I haven't read the WROX JSP book, but from what I have seen, that might be a better way to go."
3,"Mediocre - a review of ""Calico Cat's Year""","For the right price (low) this could be an okay book for the baby to preschooler crowd. Though hardly inspired, this book does have bright, cheerful pictures that I think small fry could like.As a member of the Calico Cat series, it features Calico Cat observing the four seasons. Print is large and fairly simple. A typical rhyme follows:Now it's Spring,robins sing.Kites flyin the sky.Rain showersbring flowers.Three Stars. [C-]. For the right price (currently as low as 89cents) this could be a okay book to add to a babies book shelf. Pictures are better than the text, but most small fry won't care."
2,Its loose and wobbly. Low Quality for way too much,"Being semi fond of Ateco brand, I find this product low quality and not worth the money.It is loose and wobbly, and the nut at the top doesnt tighten the cutter width at all.Dont waste your time or money on this."
1,poor quality for high volume,"Don't recommend this item for large production - we own a bakery, and it is wobbly and difficult to control. It's worth spending more to get the proper one for commercial use. Maybe it's ok for home use, but cannot imagine why anyone at home would really need it."
2,one set screw isn't enough,"Would like to add a set screw on each end. The middle three wheels will hold well with the middle screw tightened down, but not the two outer wheels. But the rest of the holes are riveted so that is not going to be a possibility, no way to tighten them down. Will hold arms with two hands and see if that works out."
4,"Not for everyone, but","Lars von Trier might not be a great person, but he makes a good movie. This film looks and feels like a stage performance. There is no set, but rather the outline of where the set would be. All the actors give it there all and it is an experience."
1,bad bad bad,The worst movie that I ever saw in my entire life. Don't waste your time and money. Terrible and Very Wierd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,This is NOT a clear shower curtain,"I bought it and was disappointed to discover that it is opaque and not ""clear""."
4,THE definitive guide to sub-New Testament writings.,"In this volume, and its companion, Wilson's English language translation of Schneemelcher's magnum opus, is presented in a most scholarly, critical edition. This book is a must, not only for the serious student of sub-New Testament literature, but also for pastors who wish to be informed as to the highest scholarship in this field.This volume, dealing with the apocryphal Gospel material, shows clearly Early Church thinking and beliefs concerning the life and ministry of Christ, as well as the views of certain heretical sects. It also provides an insight into early ""popular piety"" which has played such an important role in the development of the Christian Church."
2,Schneemelcher's N.T. Apocrypha: Penultimate edition? Not!,"I was very dissappointed with Schneemelcher's two volume; ""New Testament Apocrypha"". I ordered both volumes from amazon. First, it is exactly what I thought it wasn't. That is, it is filled with extracts, and sometimes very brief ones. For example, the Infancy Gospels, and the ""Sybilline Oracles"". Maybe I am wrong, but it seemed to me you could count on two hands how many complete texts it contained. I do not believe it even contained; ""Nicodemus"". Unless it was under an alternate title. Moreover, perhaps some will not agree, but it reminded me, in an offhand way, of a volume of Pre-Socratic philosophy. Or to take that even further, it seemed more a book -about- apocryphal literature; than the literature itself. Is that what it is? Or even a bibliography. Why is everyone calling this the ultimate edition? At nearly $100.00 I will probably return them. If it was half the cost, I might keep them for reference volumes. Thank You Nicandemus"
5,serious study,"If you're serious about biblical research, volumes I and II are must haves for your library."
5,Haier Ice Maker,I love the ice maker. It makes a lot of ice quickly and is very easy to maintain. The only problem I encountered is that the ice cubes stick together when moved from the basket in the ice maker to a freezer container. I resolved this problem by breaking the ice cubes apart with a hammer (insise a plastic bag). Aside from this I highly recommend the Maier Ice Maker. Convenient and easy to use. Well worth it's value.
2,REALIST,"ARE YOU SURE MICHAEL MOORE DIDN'T WRITE THIS. UNBELIEVABLE HOW BIASED THIS BOOK IS. SURE MANY THINGS ARE TRUE, BUT MUCH WAS LEFT OUT. VERY FRUSTRATING HOW THE LEFT CONTROLS OUR HISTORY BOOKS AND NEWS, BUT A FACT OF LIFE."
3,Good,"Mighty Baby took a while for me to get into: I bought this a few years ago and thought it was ok, but it didn't grab me.Basically, this is well written rock and roll with some progressive elements. The singer is good--at times the vocals actually sound like Clapton and Bruce in Cream, and the songs never fall into rock clechesThis is not something that is going to arrest you right away, but let it cook a while and it becomes enjoyable. I wish they pushed the progressive elements further.You probably don't have to grab this today, but if you are into 60s rock or early prog and are having one of those days where you want to buy music but really don't know what to pick from the menu, you may want to try Mighty Baby,"
4,Mighty Baby ... Flex their collective muscles,"Mighty Baby on this their first album deliver all the goods. Very competent musicianship and although originally released in 1969 stil seems relevant today.Harmony work and space between instruments suggests vocal arrangements of early Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young from around this period.Highly recommended.4 Way Street"
5,Very Enjoyable,"As usual, I picked this CD up on a chance, after hearing The Action, just to see what it was like. I have to agree with the review of Mike Reed, it is really a good little album and it gets a lot of play at our clubhouse here in St. Louis. Another lucky find in the ""I never heard of these guys"" section."
4,Enjoyable - but only if you are into fashion...,"Yes they are overpaid. Yes they are overrated...but then again, who wouldn't give their right arm just to be one of them for a day. Catwalk is an engrossing look at a top model going through one season of shows. It would've been more fascinating if the documentary had focused on some no-name lesser known model fighting her way thru the industry to get recognized...but there are some amazing moments in this documentary - primarily John Galliano's show where the models are reminiscent of Russian Princesses in sweeping ballgowns running down the runway like they are being chased to the sounds of ""Ride of the Valkyaries"" -- the Malcolm McClaren soundtrack is beautiful (you can buy it - called PARIS) - all in all interesting to sit through, but wish there was a bit more depth to the nitty gritty of the industry - i felt as if it was a bit too romanticized."
5,Catwalk VHS,"I'm very happy with the product (Catwalk on VHS). It was received much earlier than expected - at least two weeks earlier. Even though it's an older VHS tape, the picture is clear. I still hold my breath when I watch it because I'm afraid that, because it's an older tape, it will start to buckle inside the cassette and will be beyond repair, and ruin my VCR. (That's happened to me before.) I just wish Catwalk was available on DVD. I would purchase items from the seller again and, right now, am very happy with the product."
4,Ok but not awesome,THe game is good preety much except that a micro phone doesn't come with it!! IT only has 21 songs and unless they do and expansion set the game will get boring. there are only two judges that don't critique you they give you compliments!! There are only a few dance moves and closthe I'd wait to buy it until they make an expannsion set IF they do!!
4,Fun game!,"This is a fun game. You do have to actually sing during parts of the game, but you don't have to be any good-- just being loud gets you a ton of points. The only problem I have with it is that you get more money when your answers to the questions match the answers that your ""fans"" would give. Can't a superstar still think for her-or him- self? I would think so."
2,Disappointing!!! ...,"This game was extremely disappointing to me!!! ... #1 disappointment - song choice. The songs are mostly unknown songs by unknown artists - I had never even heard of half the singers, and the ones I had heard of - had songs that were not released as singles to choose from. Also, they are ALL dance songs, no ballads or anything to actually show off your voice. It's a little too much game and not enough singing fun."
3,Disappointing!,"Not sure where all these good reviews came from. This game is ok, but not much like the American Idol experience. The songs to choose from are very obscure - most of them I had never even heard of, and they are all dance songs. No ballads or anything. It's entertaining, but if you are a singer, it won't be for you."
3,Game is good but needs work,The actual game is good. The ending stinks though. Needs more songs also.
3,Surprisingly Good,"My daughter (8 years-old) enjoys this game way more than I thought that she would. A lot of the songs on it aren't familiar to her, but the game play is really set up so you don't have to know the songs to win. A lot of hand-eye coordination is needed for playing this game. I'd recommend this game for anyone 8 & up who likes computer games and board games. (It is set up much like a board game)"
3,Could Use some work,This game is good but there are only a limited number of song selections which can make it boring or difficult if you do not know or like them. I found it hard to move the mouse to make the person dance. I hope an expansion pack comes out soon to fix some of the problems and boost the song selection. My advice? Try it before you buy it.
2,Bad picture quality,This product's description is misleading. The picture quality is quite poor. I will be returning it.
2,"Worked well for about 5 days, then didn't help at all.","I took Passion RX because I am 31 years old and have a very low sex drive and no passion. I had great success the first week I took this product. In fact I was so pleased, I bought 2 more bottles. However, the second week, I went back to having no sex drive. And even though I am continuing to take Passion RX, it has not had any effect whatsoever since the first week. I take 2 pills each day in the morning, and have done so for over a month. I suppose everyone is different but I won't purchase any more. Plus I just saw a webpage from Consumer Health Digest that gives it low rating compared to other products: http://consumerhealthdigest.com/top25female.htm?source=overute/Passionrx&OVRAW=passion%20rx&OVKEY=passion%20rx&OVMTC=standard"
4,Does what it says... for me...,"I took this, as 'needed', a few years back. It was effective when taken 'as needed', but not as a continuous suppliment.I still recommend it, and was actually back here searching for it to buy more.I found that it is no longer sold on Amazon."
2,Save your money :P,"I have tried Passion RX for 1 month now, with no noticeable improvement, at all, in any area.I have better results with DHEA 100mg just by its self.For those that say it worked the first week, I would say it was just the placebo effect."
2,"As a Camera, Its not worth buying.","I bought this mainly for the small size, video clips, and still pictures. I was gonna use the other features later. The size is incredibly small and I was delighted. Did ok on the vdeo clips, even though it onlycame with a 16 meg module. Only get 20 seconds. But mainly, Until I took pictures. The pictures we outright bad."
4,everyone is amazed by how small it is and how much it does,i love this camera! its TINY! everyone is amazed by its size and features. i love everything about it except the fact the batterie dies fast and when you record a movie it can only be for 60 seconds.overall i am in love with this camera. its cheaper than those big bulky ones and does 4 times as much.just expect to buy a new memory card.
4,how do i get a battery,this is a great little camera but can anyone tell me how and where do i get a battery for the aforementioned camerai live in ireland and i have not been able to source sameregardsjohn d
3,"DTD, but little Schema","My only complaint with this book is that it emphasizes DTD over Schema a bit too much. For this and other reasons, I felt the treatment of XML seemed a little dated, and also a bit shallow."
4,Enthusiastic review for true storyteller's latest effort...,"""Shiloh"" is a story full of imagination, and what appears a tremendous effort to develop characters true to the south; true to the southwest. I find in reading the work of Joan Woodruff a pleasant resistance to formula. My enthusiasm for this work grows with my appreciation that I have been provided a story - not simply a book.If you are like me - looking for a genuine story - a genuine creation, you will enjoy the work of Joan Woodruff. Her prior work ""Neighbors"" is another great example of her talents, abilities and craft for taking you to a place and inviting you to sit and visit for a while...Suggestion: If you read ""Neighbors"" first, and then read ""Shiloh"" you may also follow the development of her literary style. My thanks to Woodruff for continuing to prove that gimmick is not all that is entertaining these days. (smile)"
5,cheap insurance for you lens,This is a very inexpensive way to protect your camcorder's lens. It does not seem to affect the image quality of your videos. I am satisfied with this UV filter.
2,Unmountable Vise,"There are neither descriptions online nor instructions in the box. I have what I consider a standard workbench, 2x4 on edge with a 5/8"" sanded plywood for a counter top. The mounting hole on the borrom of the vise to the top of the vise is approximately 1 1/2"", so you can only mount it to the 2x4, and then the top of the vise is below the counter top surface."
2,So So product,"Ok, 1st make sure you have a good INK jet printer not a laser. 2nd, make sure you have enough ink if you have a picture or back round in your print. Not everyone has a good enough ink jet printer for this product. I had to use my friends printer and buy her new ink when I was done. Thought I was going to save money doing it myself, but really didn't after all my time, frustation, and buying lots of ink. Good luck. It works if all goes ""perfect""."
4,work fine for me,I made 70 apron transfers for an event in my restaurant and they were easy to make and looked great. I also made a tshirt for my son as a test before the aprons and now I've washed it and it looks like it was just done. I have nothing negative to say about these transfers but we'll see how the aprons look after washing!
1,Zero Stars was not an option,"These are horrible! They appear to look great and go on nice, but if the shirt fabric is wrinkled, creased - basicallt used - the transfer cracks and peels. Someone please post a brand they've had good luck with, because these are worthless and waste your time and an otherwise good shirt. ZERO stars."
1,Better instructions needed,"I brought this to a professional printer who told me that he no longer works with inkjet printers, since they are old. So I tried it myself, and it just peeled and cracked. I ruined up two pieces, and am now stuck with the rest. I definitely used a different company at some point which worked great, but I cannot remember which. Do not use this if you are not sure it will work for you!"
3,Doesn't seem to work as well as others,"I've purchased Avery transfers in the past, and they've always been fine. I've used 2 sheets of this to date, and the transfers don't seem to stick as well. I've done dozens of these in the last few years, but this paper seems to be a bit sub-par. Not sure why, I follow the directions as always, and I haven't changed my process, but these don't seem quite as good as ones I've bought at Staples."
1,Mine crumbled apart after one washing.,"I pre-washed my shirt. I tested my art by printing it out on a plain sheet of paper before using the iron-on sheet. The iron-on sheet came out looking great! I followed the instructions to transfer the image, and again, everything went perfect and looked great.The trouble came when I washed the shirt. The transfer did not survive. It came out of a gentle wash cycle looking VERY crackled and even peeling off a bit. I was crushed. I wear my crackled shirt around the house, but it's not fit for the public. The dark shirt transfers seem to have gotten much better reviews, but I'm scared to try them because of how horrible this one came out."
1,"It DOES CRACK, right AWAY! FOUR HOURS of work DOWN THE DRAIN!","I am sick. I just bought the package of the Avery transfer with that encouraging sticker, affixed it as per package directions (ironing with firm pressure for a very long time, allowing to cool before peeling, etc. )to some prewashed cotton muslin, and spent four hours and lots of money sewing the transfered picture into a luxurious fabric frame with lots of expensive trims, making a gorgeous pillow to give as a prize at an annual party I host for the volunteers and staff of the museum where I work. As I was finishing the last touch, I noticed the thing was already cracking off the fabric. It is RUINED. Where can I find a transfer paper that works? This is a disaster . Obviously, I advise all to steer absolutely clear of this product. What a dud!"
1,Worst Product Ever,"Bought the ""new and improved"" version of these about 1 month ago, package didn't come with directions, I had to track them down online, followed the directions- ironed on a hard surface used heavy pressure, let them cool before I tried to peel the sticker, may-be one in ten transferred the way that it was supposed to transfer and one out of fourty didn't crack and peel the minute I started pinning my quilt together. The HP ones are way better, I have quilts that I made 10 years ago using HP transfer paper the the pictures are still going strong."
1,Horrible,These transfer are terrible:- They peal and crack if you stretch the shirt and start to break down after the first wash.- They turn yellow if you keep the iron on them too long.I've used other brands in the past that were like silk-screen results compared to this product. This reminds of the cheesy iron-on stuff we used to do back in the 80's.Waste of money.
3,"Easy to use, sticks well, but things come out too blue.","They are easy to use. I use a heat press at 375 degrees for 20 seconds when I put them on canvas tote bags and aprons. However with the new ""improved"" transfers, there is always too much blue tint. I didn't have this problem using the same pictures with the older un-improved transfers. Expect to waste a few until you adjust your pictures to reduce the blue tint."
1,turns yellow,The clear part turns yellow and there's a thick filmy residual that remains on the fabric.it's ugly and obviously amateur looking. would give zero stars if possible. don't waste your money!
5,Works Great with my Inkjet,These are really Great and Great Value... Only wish they separated from the Paper easier. I use Irons and Heat Presses with them.
1,Worked great-For About 4 Hours!,"I recently purchased a pair of these glasses/goggles for a motorcycle trip to the beach. The glasses looked fine and the foam padding made for a nice comfortable fit. About halfway through my 9 hour ride I felt very slight discomfort around my left temple. At the next rest stop I removed the glasses only to discover the left side of the frame broke and fell off. I cannot say with absolutely certainty that I didn't somehow cause the glasses to break, but I have glasses/goggles which I have had for years and replaced only because the lenses became so scratched up they were no longer useable. If you can find similar features in a different brand I would steer clear of these."
1,toenail stronger than scissors,My toenail bent the metal on the cutting edge so it was unusable. You would think they would use hardened steel. They did give me a full refund.
4,A complete manual to self-mastery through crystal work/play,"This book is full of exercises that help one to understand the mysteries of the crystalline world. Through study of each of the exercises contained herein, one gains proficiency in grounding, centring, energy work, dreamwork, healing, transmitting energy, and all of the crystal basics as well. This book also includes information about crystal tools and jewelry, in addition to displaying many illustrations and photographs to accompany each chapter.Silbey is very good at what she does, and this is one of the few books to really give you a hands-on approach to co-creating on the path to mastery with the quartz crystal."
1,not good finish,"Hi All, I bought this product a month before. The construction is very cheap, and the polarizer is not that much good. In the corners of the image I'm getting a black shade. The glass is also not so clear. Overall rating is bad. Don't go for this product."
4,Protects the lens,I am no photography expert but I do have a fairly nice Canon camera. I did not like that the lens had no protection against scratches and dirt so I bought these filters. They seem to be good quality and thread on nicely without binding. I keep the UV filter on at all times and have only used the polarized filter once. It was hard to tell a difference to adjust the filter while taking the picture looking through the digital screen on the camera. I could tell a slight difference on the actual photograph though. I mainly bought the filters to protect lens and they do a good job at that.
4,Good filters for a good price,"I bought these filters for my Kodak P880, which is a nice ""point and shoot"" with some SLR features. The lense is not removable so protecting the glass is important. The Ultra-Violet filter stay permanently on the camera, I use the polorizeing filter for exterior shooting. I've been happy with the filters, I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good filter at a reasonable price."
4,"Good Bibs, but...","These bibs are great for all the reasons other reviewers have listed. Or at least they were untill my toddler son figured out how easy they are to take off. I had some bibs by Sassy (fabric and vinal ones) the fabric ones stained and the vinal ones cracked, but they have great velco that my son can't pull off. So Id give these 5 stars if the closure on them was a little more toddler proof. For now Ive resorted to pinning them with a diaper pin, I never used them for diapers any how since Ive discoverd Snapi's! By the way, it would be great if BRU would carry these and the Bummkins diaper wraps in the're stores!"
1,"These are such crap, don't bother!","I took the advice of other reviewers and bought them, they are the pits. Flimys little pieces of cloth, yes the prints are cute but if you are looking for a great looking bib that is actually funcational you must get the Dura-bibs they have a snap open pocket to catch the food, wipe of so easy, nice substantial size and the best looking prints and phrases. Pass on these, they are not worth the money. I would say they are worth about $5.00 for the set, $14.00 is a joke."
4,Great Bib!,"This bib is fabulous! It easily wipes clean, the pocket (despite being flat) does catch crumbs and pieces of fingerfood, and it can go in the washing machine. I love that it's water repellent and nothing leaks through onto his clothing!The around the neck size is roomy, almost a little too roomy on my average sized 10 month old boy."
4,Murder in the Waiting,"Carolyn Hart's MUDER WALKS THE PLANK has Anne Darling staging a mystery cruise to help the library fund. The cruise ends in disaster when Pamela Potts goes overboard, which is only a preview of other deaths in waiting.Anne and Max are aided by their friends to bring this murder to justice who will not stop with just one death.The novel is fast paced, but does not contain the reference to other mystery authors and their works that have made previous volumes so much fun.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
5,One of her better novels,"I have read most all of Carolyn Hart's ""Death on Demand"" titles. This particular work was one of the better titles in this series. I liked the pace she set, and the storyline was interesting. No irritating characters, plausible surprises, and a different person to guess the mystery paintings at the end. I highly recommend this title to readers!"
5,Love her works,Thoroughly enjoy ordering books from Amazon and will continue always. Good selections and enjoy selling through them also!!! Good job!
4,An island dangeraous to live on,"An interesting novel, much in the same spirit than other Death on Demand stories.After so many crimes, it's bizarre there are still inhabitants on the island.Very entertaining."
3,An easy afternoon read,"Carolyn Hart writes a continuing series about the owner of a bookstore who also solves mysteries. This time she and her husband have a mystery cruise off the coast. There is a murder and our protagonist is off and running.This book is a nice afternoon read, no surprises, nothing new under the sun. Carolyn Hart is a master at her craft and this book is well crafted."
4,Garuda is a Thai Kaiju movie that is worth the viewing...,"The story centers around an elite group of Thai soldiers who's job it is to kill the creatures of myth. They are called in when the Garuda is discovered in an underfround cave. If you are familiar with Thai culture you will most likely enjoy this film as it is a rare example of a modern Thai monster movie. If you aren't too keen on monster movies then,of course, this is not for you. I thought it was much better than the Korean film Yongary 2000. Worth a look for it's obscure monster and CGI effects."
3,another laytex monster,this is a thai rubber monster movie trying to cash in on the new godzilla rubber monster fad.not as good as godzilla and gamera films but good quality for when they do show the monster.
2,Garuda is no Godzilla,"If you have a desire to see movie with non-stop action, great dialog/dubbing. And awesome special effects this movie is not for you. 45-60 minutes into the movie you get a glimpse of the garuda using CGI. And at times we see the same shot over and over again. The actor that is supposed to be an American is cast as a stupid, hyperactive moron at every turn. To such a degree that you wish he would die soon.the dubbing is so terrible that at one point you can hear an asian with a southern accent.Thai film use long dialog to state a pont when it comes to thier ghost stories. This film had so much dialog that you may have to fast forward the film to find any action as i did......many times. The ending of the film makes you ask two questions. How? and Why?So if you enjoy slow, lathargic and annoying films you might like this one."
1,Boring,"This book is a pathetic attempt to copy Edith Wharton's beautiful novel ""Ethan Frome."" It does not have the power of Wharton's classic and does not hold the reader's interest. I thought that this book just rambled on without a purpose until its conclusion. It should have never been given the Pulitzer Prize."
5,LOL and Great Gift Too,"Laugh-out-loud (LOL)! There is something to smile about--or chuckle over--on every page!The prose is light and fun, the characters amusing and often ironic, and the plot thickens. I think this is this novelist's first book--and it appears she has a bright future!This book also would make a good gift for girlfriends (and boyfriends!)."
2,Generic chick lit,"Claire St. John, recently moved back to Texas from New York after a painful divorce, has a breakthrough one drunken evening: she's going to write a book for men about what goes on in the ladies' room. The book will be filled with practical advice for the more clueless members of the species. The Men's Guide to the Women's Bathroom, the novel, is pretty much your standard chick lit, with the requisite cliches: the love interest, the gay best friend, and the nutty mother.There's nothing here that really distinguishes this book from all the other tripe that's published today. Nothing is fresh or new or exciting. The humor is canned, and the writing style is childish. This book really isn't worth the time or the money you might otherwise spend on it."
2,False advertisement,The headphones displayed aren't the ones that were actually shipped. I specifically wanted the ones that were displayed and received another pair instead.
1,Too big,"I am not a big person but I have bought OTC headphones before w/o trying them on and been able to adjust. These would not adjust small enough to use. (I am 5'1""). Sending back was expensive w/ their policies. I gave them to Goodwill and never did get past the size problem. So, this is not a review about sound quality."
4,No trace pants,Nice pants for the price. I have worn them on several archery hunting trips. They are cut to be easy for walking and the pockets are well located. The material is also cool for warmer weather hunting. For me the waist seems larger than stated and they are difficult to keep up without suspenders with heavy stuff in them which is why 4 v. 5 stars.
2,cheap cammo pants,"The pants were shipped promptly and I liked that. They are not constructed well though, resulting in an improper fit. The waist ends up way over your belly button.I wouldn't buy this product again."
3,Nice looking but not very soft,I have a five month old bullmastiff puppy and she likes to cuddle in her crate with her puppy blanket so I thought adding this bed would give her a nice bolster to rest her head on and soften the crate bottom to prevent any calluses on her elbows. It is a nice collar and is soft to the touch but the center area is very thin and doesn't really provide any padding. She still digs her blanket into a nest in one corner but I think the bolster has helped her prop her head a bit since she is snoring less. This bed would not stand up to any chewing of the bolster and slides a bit so if your puppy or dog is very rambunctious or chews a lot this probably would not work for you. I wouldn't return it but I probably would not buy the same one again- I would get a thicker square dog bed instead if you are looking for a soft padding for the crate.
2,Need more padding,"For my old dog, I had to add padding for his old joints and bones. For the money, I should have stuck with the old and reliable retailer."
5,Fantastic!,My 2 year old son adores this book! I've read it to him so many times and he never tires of it.
4,Metheny and Mays shine on Side One of Soundtrack,"While Side 2 (commencing with Bowie's crooning on the theme song) is pretty much a wash out in terms of jazz and film music - the chorales are just too much!), Side 1 is a different kettle of fish altogether. Highglighting a string of 4 SUPER CUTS is the main theme ""Chris"", probably the seminal pre-hip hop rhythm of the 80s, layered with Lyle Mayes poignant synthesizers. ""Chris"" is one of those hypnotic groove jams you immediately want to put on a tape loop and play for 60 minutes until you've achieved that altered state of consciousness. ""Dalton"", another jam, is almost just as infectious. So just program your CD to repeat the first four cuts ad infinitum and you'll be transported."
3,Save your money,"I am a huge Pat Metheny fan, but I can't heartily recommend this album (but I could enthusiastically recommend the 10 other Pat Metheny CDs I own and treasure!). Why? Because ""Falcon"" is too repetitive--variations on a theme by ""This is not America"", and not much else. I had hoped for another ""Passagio per il Paradiso"", which I find to be more interesting."
3,"love Metheney, but this is nothing special","As much as I love the Metheney Group, there is nothing here that hasn't been done much better in many other albums. There are more abstract sections which move into the realm of the avant-guarde; presumably these correspond to events in the movie. There is a song done by David Bowie with Metheney accompaniment, but it is dull and lifeless.Don't get me wrong - a Metheny / Mays composition will always be a joy to hear, and this is no exception. And possibly a knowledge of the movie would make the music more meaningful (I have not seen the movie). However, these compositions are small, contained, with no solos (!), and leave me cold."
5,A stunning soundtrack,"Even if you don't see the movie, this recording will blow you away.There is so much here. I would compare it to Joni Mitchell's "" Heijira "". An awesome effort of pure genius. If you don't get this album, you're dead and too stupid to fall down."
5,I finally found it,"I'd been looking for this particular CD for years which is hard to find in the usual and conventional retail stores. However,it was easily obtainable on Amazon. I'll keep coming back to Amazon for more music. It's a great CD, and I guess well worth the wait to finally obtain."
4,Metheny's only soundtrack??,"ummm, I hope sutherland's review was written before 1999, when Metheny did the soundtrack for ""A Map of the World."""
4,Great movie score,"One needs to have watched the movie to enjoy the musical score, as a backdrop to how life seemed to go awry for two Catholic former altar boys. Pat Metheny's style is elemental, somewhat echolaliac, and definitely original. I suppose recalling the starkness of life that had gotten awry from much promise makes one reach back to what made life promising. Thus, from many of those who had reviewed this album, the music might falter in encouraging Pat Metheny would-be fans. I think that for an artist to lend his originality to a film that was stirring (or any film that stirs thoughts towards philosophy-making) Pat Metheny stands out rather well."
1,Horrible in terms of any style of rock music,"This CD is the worst rock album I have ever purchased. I own some 500-600 albums, of rock alone, ranging from 1950s-1990s (90's were when I began to start hating rock music). As a musician, I cannot appreciate this garbage for any reason.I have a 5 CD changer in my car and I put this in there when I wanted to listen to the album for the first time.I listened to it once, and it was really bad. The first album I have ever skipped multiple tracks in a row because the first 1.5-2 minutes of the songs were just that bad.Another day, I listened to it again on accident because it was still in my cd changer, and I had forgotten which number cd it was. At this point I got very angry and took the cd out of the cd player, then snapped it in half and threw it out the car window so that it could be ran over by other cars."
4,A true gem,"The Tale of the Tape offers a rare glimpse into the early, post-Piper years of Billy Squier. In my opinion, Squier is a highly underrated, straightforward rocker. His unique vocals perfectly compliment a stripped-down accompaniment of raw guitars and thundering drums. This CD contains a lot of little-known, yet catchy tunes. Not really a bad song on here. Standing out particularly is the anthemic ""The Big Beat"" and the girlfriend-gone-astray ""Who's Your Boyfriend"". If you like simple, gritty hard rock, then I'd highly recommend this."
4,Billy's first is classic Squier,"Tape of the tape is much like Don't Say Nobut not as rocking. It has rocking moments.The Big Beat, Rich Kid and You should behigh love. Songs like Calley oh and Who'syour boyfriend are great catchy pop tunes.Squier first solo album should've had morehits but he did great on all his albums evenwithout the hits that avoided him after MTVkilled it with the Rock me tonight video.The song was and is still great! MTV ruinedmany a carrer but Squier still has die hard fans."
5,Don't say no to this one.,Every bit as good as the enormous records that followed. So glad I finally picked this one up. Highly recommended.
4,A very good pre-training book,"Since I'm going to learn how to paraglide this spring, I decided to buy a book to help initiate me. Mr. Whittall obviously knows his sport and knows how to dumb it down a bit for us beginners. He tells you what you can expect your first times launching and landing, the importance of a serious attitude toward this specialized aviation, and all sorts of tidbits about weather and finding lift. Although the book as a whole could have used better organization and proofing before publication, it is nevertheless an enjoyable and informative read."
2,No real detail,"Try to cover too much, without much substance. I might help you get an overall idea of the sport, but not much more than common sense.I am a beginner, but not a starter and was looking for a book of which I can learn and apply from."
4,a good book which is now probably better.,"I had to buy this book as part of the paragliding training course I did last year. the book prepared me well, and I still find myself thumbing through it every now and again. the sport of paragliding is moving forward technology-wise and my only criticism would be that the book is dating quickly but I have just noticed that Noel Whittal has released an updated version of the book..it would be a good idea to get the latest version."
3,Magnets,"This item was for my husband. It has alot of pieces that can easily be lost. The magnets are in flexible vinyl tubing with magnets at both ends, some of them are not flexible. There are small magnet balls and the metal rods to hang the magnets from. The main plate for support is plastic and can be broken. It is not fun enough for children. It shows how positive and negative ends of magnets work with each other. Overall, legos are more fun."
5,Great Intro,"This is a wonderful series and very practical for someone who is considering a visit. I don't get the sense that everything you see is strictly for the cameras as it seems to be in so many other travel shows. I'm not sure why the DVDs are so expensive, though."
3,Cheap but has limitations,"This filter offers cheap protection for your lens but not much else. I've never heard of Sunpak but decided to try it out since it was cheap. After using it at an indoors event I see its limitations. Lack of multi coating caused reflections of strong light sources in the images. A projected image in a dark room was reflected upside down in another area of the photo.Have not tried direct sunlight, strong daylight photos yet."
3,"Inexpensive, decent quality","The filter fits well on my camera but I have had about 3 of these. I take very good care of my camera equipment but these always seem to break on me. These work well and fit great but perhaps its just my luck that they always break. Theyre cheap so it wouldn't be bad to try it out first and if it breaks, just look for another brand."
4,"Protects well, filters?","I'm an amateur photo enthusiast and purchased this filter for the 'protection' it provides the lens. Protection from dust, primarily. I'm not sure about the filtering part. Most shots look fine from my perspective."
5,Inexpensive lens protector,Build quality is good. Fit my Nikon 50mm/f1.8 prime lens perfectly. It also fits D50 kit lens very well.
2,unsure of the results,"The price is right but I was left with photos that had a gridded pattern on them, especially in light areas like the sky. I don't know if it is just a fluke but I have since taken it off of my lens, it was also hard to remove."
1,Not so great afer all,This filter was good at first until I noticed that the reflection off it is terrible . If there is any additional light it is even worse. I did a wedding and ended up taking it off. Yes I have to clean lens more often and its not protected but I would rather be careful than have bad shots.
3,Narrative Unity,Good commentary on Acts although at times the grouping of subjects makes it hard to use when researching pericopes. Provides good background and some solid ideas. Weak on connectimg Acts with the Lukan Gospel.
2,horrible production value and sound quality,"This DVD has terrible sound. The musicians, songs, and arrangements are great but the stage is cheesy and the sound quality is awful. I have the Africando All Stars CD and the sound is pristine. The DVD, in my opinion, ruins the music with the terrible audio production. At times the vocals are distorted and the horns are all shrieking treble with no warmth in the mix. If you care at all about audio quality stay away."
3,"Uh, er, well, um ....","Somehow, I don't think that's the correct cover for this album.(In truth, it's a very black, proud and bare-breasted woman. Tapper's a better producer than he is a toaster, but he doesn't deserve to have his cover art censored.)<edit>That's better. But shouldn't there be a little symbol saying ""No Cover Image Allowable""?"
3,Its not what you expect!,This DVD is great for a person who knows nothing about lighting in 3D. If you want to learn lighting for a scene or lighting an envirormant your better off getting a book on it. I was disapointed w/ this DVD.
2,Can't screw on to lens,"The threaded section of the filter is too short. If your lens or filter adapter has threads that are recessed by more than 1/16 of an inch, this filter can't be securely fastened. Other than that, the quality of the filters is ok."
4,Sunpak CF-7079 55mm TW Ultra-Violet & Circular Polarizer Twin Filter Pack,"This is the first time I have used a UV and a polarizing filter, so I can't make comparisons. The filters screw easily on to the lens and the sun-shade lens cover of my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50. The polarizing filter is easy to turn and noticeable color and light shades are most apparent when focusing on snow or water. For the price, they are worth it."
3,"Fun game, too easy","Dont get me wrong, this was a pretty fun game and the story was decent. Graphics were good and enjoyable...The game would deem a challenge if it weren't for force powers. I mean, the game was more of a challenge pre-lighsaber. Granted it was just the first few levels so it couldn't be anything too hardcore. If the game was restricted like the first few levels, it would have deems difficult, but it isn't now is it?The game becomes tedious and boring right about then. Force Speed + Lightsaber = Everyone Dies....At the offset of an engagement, activate force speed and you whip around too fast for anyone to kill you. So every bad guy you come across, you activate that and run at them causing their demise. Not to mention the force choke off high place ;-)overall the game was fun, but it loses a lot of points because it gets too easy with the force speed followed by lightsaber attack..."
5,JEDI OUTCAST ROCKS,"OKay, if you're at all a fan of either of the first get this game. It rocks. It takes the Quake 3 and Alien Versus Preator 2 Engins combinds them, supes them up and lets you out and an all out Jedi style war. Fun, Fast, Furrious, and totaly immursing play features. So many saber moves, new weapons and forece powers. You will love this if you enjoy any LucasArts games and or are a Star Wars fan. This thing rocked my world. I found it ingaging and fun, you could fall into the worlds of Kyle Katarn and Jan Oris again and again.This is a great sequil to the sequil that killed the first in the series. And if you get the Collectors Edition you get the whole trilogy, and they have been revamped a bit. Dark Forces has never looked better.Hope you all enjoy this thing it rules."
3,"does Okay, better than anything else I've found","Very easy to set up and use. I bought this system to clean my tile floors and grout lines. The brushes spin, however, there is not enough weight to push the brushes into all the grooves. I plan on using it frequently for a while and hopefully I'll be able to get most of the dirt out, but I think I'm back on my hands and knees to get that grout clean. This machine can't get it clean but maybe it can keep it clean once I scrub it out."
4,Great machine and simple to use,"I found this machine worked great. We have over 900 sq. ft. of slate flooring and I was very happy with the results using the scrub brushes. I did find following with a towel was necessary to keep the dirty water out of the grout. I only had to fill the tank about 3 times to clean the entire floor! I gave the item a 4 only because after the initial cleaning of the slate, I had to order more scrub brushes. I wish they had lasted at least one more round."
4,So thrilled!,This was definitely worth the money! No more scrubbing on my hands and knees. This gets pretty close to corners and undid 6 months worth of dirt on vinyl floors and now they look like new. For this to be effective I would recommend purchasing a vinyl or linoleum floor stripper and letting that sit for half an hour then use this machine. Follow that up with a floor sealer to make it shine again. I rated it 4 stars because it took half an hour to put together which is not terrible and because the white buffing pads that it comes with are supposed to be attached to the scrubber attachment and it was nearly impossible to do that. I plan on purchasing a separate buffing attachment for my wood floors. I forgot to mention you can also shampoo rugs too I can't wait to try that.
3,Not what I expected.,I must have read the advertisement incorrectly. I DID NOT expect to have to MOP the floor after it was scrubbed by this device. I would not purchase another item from this manufacturer.
3,"Priced Right, but Sloppy","Edit: I just noticed that I have two 21mm wrenches and not a 21mm and 22mm. Poor quality control. Lowered to 3 stars. Now have to deal with hassle...Original:The Denali tool set is priced right, but was surprised to find that it didn't include an 18mm wrench. Don't get me wrong, I know it is my fault having not noticed before ordering, but 18mm seems pretty standard on a lot of the car work I do.Well made, easy to read sizes, and nice case otherwise. No problems with case like previous reviewers."
5,Denali metric wrench set,"This is a good set for a good price. The heavy cloth holder keeps them organized by size. There is not a lot to say about a wrench. The fit is cood, it is thin enough to reach small places. The size is written large enough so you don't have to squint.Denali 15-Piece Combination Wrench Set, Metric"
4,Does What It's Supposed To,"It's a decent product that worked great for me. I don't do much work that requires tools, but this set worked great at getting a bolt off a part for my truck that i couldn't reach with the set i had. You can tell the metal isn't great and is fairly cheap. I could feel the open end bending and straining as i tried to get a nut off, but the closed end worked fine.They look really nice, the finish is really shiny and the logo on them looks good.If you want a cheap set of wrenches for the everyday work, I'd recommend these."
5,Nice Wrenches,All the sizes i wanted in a cool holder. They look nice quality. I will update after use if any negative feedback on their strength.
4,Great story for young teen girls,"Another Lily book with some good Christian morals embedded in the story.In this book, while Lily has a list of a bunch of new stuff she wants for Christmas, her parents have a different idea this year. Lily and her two brothers are not thrilled about it. However, an important lesson is learned--one that many children should learn too.Great story for young teen girls to read."
1,too much money !!! get the barons course- it's better,For such a price i expect more. Too much English is spoken. The super boring conversatins repeated over and over make you want to commit suicide. The Baron's program cost much less and is more intense and diverse. Best yet get a Peter Maffay cd.
1,what a ripoff,"bought the german I tapes. I have some german couse experience about 30 yrs ago. I found the tapes extremely basic and the vocabulary rudimentary. I thought it was a waste of money to buy these expensive tapes for so little return. I have not listened to the german II tapes, but now I am not so sure that these would be any better. I have the Spanish tapes and they were just excellent so I am very surprised to see that the German tapes are such a ripoff!!!!!!!!"
2,Wait for the next version,"I enjoyed German I & II, however I am having problems with German III. The flow is great between the previous CDs but the presentation leaves much to be desired.In German I & II the conversations were great with inflection in the speakers voices that could lead you to believe you were listening to a real conversation. In German III it is obvious the speakers are reading sentences on a page and have no idea how their sentences are to be put togather.The guy who says, ""Sagen Sie"" and ""Fragen Sie"" sounds like he is about to fall asleep. My CDs seem to have been made in 1998 by recording the cassettes from 1994 onto CDs. (You can hear the poor quality of tape compared to CDs.)I recommend waiting until 2004 when the new version is out for this product. German I & II have a copyright after 2000."
4,Fairly satisfied,"I've completed Pimsleur 2 and 3. Although I feel the programs have the right approach, Level 3 should have been more difficult. There was a considerable amount of redundancy between level 2 and 3...... IMO you can always go back and listen to level 2, level 3 should have moved on. Some of the dialogue should have even been covered in level 1, not levels 2 or 3.New students NEED a grammar book."
4,Gamalon Who???,"If you like instrumental albums get this one. Very, very jazzy. I played this album for some friends and asked, ""I bet you can't guess who this is"". They thought it was early Joe Satriani (""Not of this Earth"") with Stu Hamm on bass."
2,Disappointed!,"I purchased this watch over 4 years ago and I have probably worn it twice. The colore was not as described and the face is much too small, I think even for a much younger woman! The leather on the band is very nice though, but doesn't matter much if its in my watch box!"
4,An interesting adaption...,"of the classic weird tale ""The King In Yellow"" which, as legend has it, directly inspired HP Lovecraft's oeuvre. I enjoyed many aspects of this adaption, and adaption it is; it takes some license with Robert W. Chambers' original, but it does have enough menace and oddity to make the experience worthwhile. Aaron Vanek's vision of the tale is Lynchian to say the least with peculiar guests populating a deserted hotel and a lot of dark imagery and long shots. Shawna Waldron as Tess is very good, though I feel slightly under-used, and Dale Snowberger as Aubrey is fascinating.Of the additional films on the DVD the standout is Tupilak, a French shortfilm by David Leroy which is superbly shot, acted and scripted. My only complaint is it's too short!"
3,Acceptable,"The abrasive wears off the grinding rod quickly, but this system does what it was purchased to do. It helps to have had some experience doing this task before."
1,I hated the ending...way to out there for me.,The movie was very interesting until the last five or ten minutes. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I'm not going to tell you but it is disgusting. Don't waste your time.
5,A film hard to forget,"This is a most remarkable film, both the photography, the music score and the acting. Two thumbs up for both Michelle. The ending is disturbing but understandable.Recommended for those who love watching films about deep emotions."
2,Great cinematography but...,"I love films set in polar regions and the cinematography of this piece is stunning. I gave it 2 stars for that reason.There are some beautiful sections of the film, but there's also really creepy violence. If you find it entertaining to see realistic footage of people getting their throats slit, this film is for you. It's not for me."
4,Darker than you think,This film is one of the darkest I've seen in a long time. Heartbreaking and terrifying. Worth watching. You won't be disappointed.
3,Beware of Mommy Dearest,"Very weird fantasy film set in a strange new world in the Arctic tundra where some Nazi-like men appear to run things while everyone else is on the run. This got off to a grisly start for me with the dog-killing scene, and I almost didn't finish the film. The mother-daughter vibe here strange. And there are questions: like where do they get their clothing from? How do they even survive what must be sub-zero cold in those flimsy tents? Anyway, the ending is a shocker and then it's over. Watch at your own risk."
4,fine film,"it was a rather silly plot in the end: girl never sees man, sees man, flirts with man, other woman gets jealous because she wants man, female tension. then sex, jealousy, more sex, then girl wants to have a family, angst, some weird sex, then DEATH."
4,A SUBTLE SWING,"This was issued in 1990 by Columbia Legacy in their Best Of Big Bands series, and spans mid-1936 to early 1939. Eleven of the eighteen tracks are instrumentals and show what an excellent orchestra this was. The reason was not simply the excellence of Eddie Sauter's arrangements but also, as the late Dick Sudhalter points out in the liner note, that the emphasis was on playing with restraint. That's not to say that the result is not exciting, rather that it is what the audience labelled ""subtle swing"". That was suited perfectly to Mildred Bailey's voice, which she deployed with sensitivity. As a bonus, two previously unissued titles (I Kiss Your Hand, Madame and A-Tisket, A-Tasket are included), and their presence compensates for what today is regarded as short measure."
5,Every bread I make has improved,"Since I use the method of working the dough used in this book every bread I make has improved. The crust is better, the crumb is better and the bread has a better spring in the oven. The DVD is a great learning tool because watching Richard Bertinet makes his method easy to understand and to follow.The only regret I have is that I did not have Richards Bertinet book/DVD 10 years ago when I started my bread baking hobby.Richards second book ""Crust"" is also fantastic."
5,"great book and DVD, very inspirational","I got the bread baking bug after getting a Cuisinart and learning to make pizza. I've made a few breads before getting this book but this book is a revelation - full of great ideas and fantastic pictures. Sometimes the instructions leave you wishing you could ask questions or leave a few details out. Overall, though, a great book of ideas and bread-making inspiration."
5,great practical book,Its a great practical book. I recommend to everyone.If you are an expert its a special book and if you are not an expert you will be using the dvd attached to the book.I can see that the goal was this book to make sure that you CAN do it!! Its great and we use it every week! Thanks My kids love all the breads.::))
3,Very light read...maybe running out of ideas?,"I bought the first and second book in this series on the strength of previous reviews. ""The Scent of Shadows"" was a 4 star book for originality and pacing, a better read than this second in the series. With the second book, Ms. Pettersson seems to be running out of steam already. Her premise wears mighty thin as the supposedly brilliant and dedicated enemies of ""the light"" can't figure out the amazingly obvious artifice of ""the Archer's"" fake identity. And we're treated to a seemingly endless cycle of repetitive actions and last minute rescues of her heroine. How many times can the same thing happen in one book?Having said that, I didn't hate the book; it's a decent light read, but I'm not sure I'd pick up the third installment."
3,Good writer bad book,If you want to know what Paris Hilton would be like as a super hero read this book. I read the previous book and loved it but in this book Jo has turned into a air head. She is constantly being saved from some mess she's gotten into.I certainly wouldn't want to be a an innocent by stander around her because innocents are dropping like flies. What type of super hero is she? What really bugged me about this book was she never follows through with or defended her plans. She was just a bubble head through out the book. I will still buy the next book everyone makes mistakes. Buy the book because you'll need it to follow the storyline in future books.
2,Such Promise,"I had my problems with the first book, but overall I was excited by what I thought would be a great supernatural series, with a snarky non-cookie cutter heroine. Mainly, I thought Ms. Pettersson could have benefited from the use of a good editor. But this new book was a disappointment. The heroine has become Too Depressing To Live. As another reviewer pointed out, absolutely nothing good seems to happen, and while I like my dose of reality, this was way too much. I can't help but think that I would have liked this book more if it was released in winter, but with all this sunshine and blue skies, it was just a complete downer."
2,Too much,"The author had one of the best ideas for a paranormal storyline that I have read recently. She really, really came up with a great idea. It's interesting and she has good supporting cast and villains. So, why two stars? The writing of the main character is just pathetic. By the time that I was drug through one too many iterations of her moaning and moping for the ""love of her life"" I just couldn't stand it any longer.Now, this may be good stuff for the Romance crowd and if that works for you then enjoy the books. I just can't stand someone who is so strong and defiant about why she can't be controlled by anything continually mope over some guy who she hadn't seen in years and then is suddenly in flames over after a brief visit. Weak minded drivel that belittles the intellect of an otherwise tolerable main character."
3,A potato chip book...,"This series so far is like junk food. It's not really filling, but you can't help yourself from coming back for more. In this book we see Joanna do more of what she does best: mope, brood, get angry, & generally not be a team player. It would get annoying, except it is so much fun to watch her act this way & all things considering, it's not entirely unreasonable for her to act this way. However, the one complaint I do have is that there has been no development in Joanna's maturity level. I do understand that it takes time to win over people (especially when they start off disliking her), but she doesn't seem to really understand the whole teamwork thing. Still, that is a huge plot point in the book that propels the events in the end of the book, so I guess we should just trust Pettersson to keep up the good work. Each book of hers gets better than the last one & I'm looking forward to the next book."
4,An Intriguing Dish,"After having read The Scent of Shadows,The Scent of Shadows (Sign of the Zodiac, Book 1), I instantly felt the need to find out what happens next. The Taste of Night tells the continuing tale of Jo, a tough, sassy lady with a load of attitude and issues. How to kick butt? How to prove her worth to the troop? How to gain their trust? Not to mention dealing with her estranged (deranged) father and the memories of a life left behind. The story takes many interesting and enthralling twists and turns and I have to admit that I didn't totally see the ending. In all a great read and I can not wait to see what happens next."
2,Disappointing,"Really liked the first book. While it wasn't perfect, it had much promise and was a unique story, and I was excited to read the 2nd book. But Book 2 is awful. The story is a mishmash with too many unbelieveable threads. One minute it's imperative she keep her cover secret; the next minute it's no longer an important part of the story. The main character makes idiotic choices, not just once but again and again. I read the whole book, hoping it would redeem itself at the end. Unfortunately, it did not. I won't be reading a book 3 if there is one. Very disappointing. I gave it 2 stars because while the character really was too dumb to live, the book itself was fairly well written."
5,Always a pleasure to read and read again!,"I have now read through the Signs of the Zodiac series twice and ""Taste of Night"" stands as my favorite."
3,dissappointed,"The first book caught my interest and I loved it's originality. In this book, the heroine was whiny and lackluster. She lacked direction and never seemed to get on track. I kept thinking, ""Get smart!"", but it never happened. I'm afraid that this felt like a slice of life and didn't seem to have a purposeful place to go and logic seemed to float away. So much potential, oh well."
4,3.75 Star Sequel is Well Worth Reading,"Vicki Pettersson's 2nd entry in the Sign of the Zodiac series has some great moments, especially the ones that reveal more of the secrets of the Zodiac universe, scenes in the secret sanctuary, and ones featuring JoAnn's interactions with the people in her life who are 'normals.' However, there are too many long descriptive passages that do little to advance the plot or characterizations. The whole superhero concept Pettersson's mapped out is entertaining, and the book in general is a page-turner. I just happened to skim some of the more redundant parts, and there were a few more redundant parts than I would've liked.I was entertained, and will be back."
4,Pretty but Broken :(,"The dishes are pretty but were poorly packaged and arrived broken. That was a big disappointment. The pattern looks good but even though these dishes say England on the bottom, a sticker on each item says ""Made in China."" The marking on the bottom of the dishes just means that it is an English company."
2,Unfortunately not packaged for shipping,I read the reviews and knew the risk going in. As mentioned by nearly every other reviewer this set of dishes is not packaged for shipping. I don't know why anyone would ship anything like this. Lucky for me only one saucer is broken.
2,"Beautiful set, but broken pieces","Beautiful set, very poor packaging. As such, because of more than 4 broken pieces, I had to return the set. Now waiting for reimbursement.I have seen other comments about this set with similar content.Maybe Amazon would be able to improve packaging, and then there will be more happy customers."
1,"Good quality product, to bad most of it broke during shipping","I purchased this pattern to match a set I already had. I have shopped online several times and have never had any trouble with purchasing glass items. This however arrived in the box you would find on the shelf in the store! No special wrapping, no bubble wrap, nothing! Only one plate arrived unbroken. What were they thinking? Well let me just warn all of you before you buy - STOP! It is a waste of money."
3,Errors I encountered,"I have placed just one order in early December for Willow Blue China from Johnson Brothers. I did not place a second order in late December.Three saucers in this order were broken. The only way it was suggested that this could be resolved was to return the 20 piece china set and receive a replacement. I did not return the set with the broken china and I did not receive a replacement. However, the computer indicated that I purchased this set on December 28, 2005. I did not do this."
3,Unfortunately Boring,"If you are interested in memory, this is considered a classic and a must read. Although the subject is fascinating, the book is organized and written in such a way that the writing is disappointing and felt dated to me. Probably just the nature of the book, but i can't recommend it to anyone who isn't REALLY interested in memory."
5,An Endless Abyss of Fascination,"This is a highly unique and true story about a remarkable man. S. (we never discover his true name) is a mnemonist, an individual with an apparently limitless memory capacity. The book chronicles the study of S. by Dr. Luria in Russia. Having found his subject's memory endless, He then studied the bizarre nature of S.'s memory, and the nature of S's thoughts and how all this affected S.'s life and personality. What we read about is an alien mind, filled with pictures, colors, clouds and tastes but often crowding out any kind of sense or meaning.This is a very fascinating and original book, from beginning to end."
3,Effect of prodigious memory on personality,"Some of the other reviewers have faulted Luria for not noticing the resemblance bewteen his subject's memory techniques and those used in the Middle Ages. With all due respect to those reviewers, the point of this book (clearly stated by Luria in the introduction) is to examine the effect of such a remarkable capacity for memory on the development of the subject's PERSONALITY. The key is in the approach: to examine how personality structure may hinge on a feature of psychic activity. This book does NOT concern itself specifically with the mechanisms of memory, although, of course, these are discussed as a preliminary to the discussion of memory's effect on personality development."
5,Cropping Delight,"I received the 2004 calendar for Christmas last year and WOW! It gave me a lot of ideas plus a lot of borders, cutouts, headlines (for dates), etc. There are 365 days to crop. I gave a the week of graduation to a friends daughter and she was able to create pages for each day of graduation week. There are pages for everyone and some I won't use. I highly recommend even if you don't like scrapbooking because it is so delightful to look at."
5,Those who fail to understand history are doomed to repeat it,"I can't believe that such a classic monumental work, the work of a man's life, is being sold here used for eight dollars! This was one of my first military books which I started reading when I was about 15 years old, and I still come back to it from time to time 20 years later. If you want a fundamental understanding of basic military matters and military history, told in an engaging narrative form, from the battle field to logistics to politics, social beliefs and diplomacy, from Ancient Greece to the Korean War, you start here. This work should be republished and reread after the Second Gulf War, to quote: ""Those who fail to understand history are doomed to repeat it."""
3,A good effort marred by archaism,"Volume II of New Testament Apocrypha represents a comprehensive collection of the pseudo-apostolic writings of early Christianity. The introductions are quite good. The translations, however, are marred by frequent use of achaic, pseudo-biblical language which has thankfully been done away with in most modern translations of ancient texts. Do we really need to read words like ""haply"", ""whilst"", and ""such-like"", or a phrase like ""do ye repent you"" in the late 20th century? For those just interested in sampling a variety of these works, and more, a good portion of the translations of this book are available at a lower price in ""The Other Bible"". For the hard core, however, this book does contain material unavailable elsewhere."
2,pretty average Album but,"""Struck By You"" was my Jam.the Bar Kays were always taking cuts that were happening at the time or Slangs going on&then bringing them into there fold.this Album is a watered down attempt at New Jack Swing for the Most part but ""Struck by You"" saves the day&Larry Dotson nails this cut.I still dig the part Let's get Busy baby."
4,"It isn't right, but it's real","Danny Glover depicts a haunted Vietnam vet who's secluded himself in the Pacific Northwest. When a man formerly under his command shows up with his half Vietnamese daughter, Linny, and entrusts her fate to him, he's reluctant, but he and the girl gradually develop a relationship and also begin to interact with the community around them, including even more isolated Vietnam vets.This film doesn't have the ending I'd hoped for--in either the theatre or the alternate ending. As a former Vietnam vet I worked with once said, ""It ain't right, but it's real.""That's the way I felt when I finished this film."
1,Can't get past Glover's public political persona,"This movie could have been 5 stars for me but I couldn't get past Glover and his public statements about our country. Good actors make you believe in the character they are playing, but when they become political lightning rods it becomes more difficult to ever identify with a character they play. I believe, for instance, the Dixie Chicks had a right to say what they did but I cannot stand their music as a result...same goes for Glover. Too bad they chose him for this movie because the film's message is so important, true and sad."
1,missing in america,HiWhy on earth did you send a video that was not suitable for this region [Australia]. What poor service.Gerald
2,Where's the Gospel?,"Is this the actual Gospel? Don't know, gave up after reading stuff I didn't want to read. No table of contents to find out the answer to early question."
4,Nice but...,"Cool shirt, good price, company shipped it fast. Only problem is you cant see the band name ""BANE"" all too well. The grey it is printed in doesnt show up that well against the green. Picture does the printing a lot of justice. Too much. You can hardly see the band name. I bought it with the thought of it being a BANE shirt. Instead its just an army guy shirt.. Still a mad cool shirt though."
1,dont rely on this book for MPRE,"This book is a great overview to professional responsibility and very interesting but if you rely on it to take the MPRE you will fail. only write this for people out there like me who are taking a second Bar and MPRE after moving to another state, years after completing law school, and looking for MPRE study materials online. There arent ANY MPRE TEST QUESTIONS IN HERE - you have to do old tests, tons of them, to pass."
5,Incredible Album,"This is easily my favorite 311 album, although Grassroots is a semi-close 2nd. For a debut album, they really hit the nail on the head (much like Rage did with their debut). I can listen to every song on the album straight thru, and with the exception of NixHex, which I find a tad self serving, but still listen to, they are all 5 star songs. From the hard rocking Visit, Plain and Feels So Good, to the laid back Paradise and My Stoney Baby, and the unique Do You Right this album had a real edge to it the later albums lacked, although I still like their later albums. Just not as much as this one. If you don't have this one and are a 311 fan, all I can do is shake my head in dissapointment until you grab it."
3,Funk Rock,"This is a good CD better then average 311 are a great band that pretty much this genre of ""Funk Rock"" Its not my favorite type of music but boy they are good at it. This CD has the coolest choruses on just about every song although im not a fan of the verses maybe its because its too rappy but I guess that is what I should expect from a band that has a rapper and a singer. As for lyrics go, eh im not a huge fan of all this positive stuff I mean yeah have a few tracks about being positive but everysong is cheery.This is a good CD if you are into funk/rock and like positive lyrics check it out, and if you already like 311 get this.Stand Out Tracks: Freak Out, Do You Right and Feels So Good"
5,311 are and will always be the best,"Good Good Good cd, I never get tired of hearing it. Go buy it if it's not in your collection already. If you're into the later 311 albums, this will be a pleasant surprise."
5,Probably the best 311 album,"this is a stunning debut album. it wasnt my first 311 album but to think this is how the started is amazing. very, very few bands have this much talent, especially on their first cd. every track is amazing,a nd you will find yourself dancing all over the place. this is probably their best cd, although EVERY one of their albums are excellent. do yourself a favour and buy this cd."
5,One of the best debut CD's of the 90's,"This album may indeed be 311's best, by virtue of the fact that the quality of the songs and lyrics showcase this band's undeniable sound. Whatever producer Eddie Offord did, it was take the seeds of these 5 guys, and plant them in just the right way. To think P-Nut was only 19 when they recorded this...if you enjoy reggae and/or music that can enlighten you, buy this album. Unquestionably groovy with a harder sound at times that they have done away with since in favor of a more pop sound. This CD, along with grassroots, made my freshman year of college worthwhile."
4,They Were Rap Metal Before Rap Metal Was Cool,"311 were rap metal before rap metal was cool. Back in the day they were compared to The Beatie Boys and various rappers, but they really evoke modern acts like Limp Biscuit or Orange 9mm. If you're into that sort of loud party music, then 311 are highly recommended. They are, along with Rage Against the machine the beginning of the genre. Typically of the time, there is a guest spot for a reggae rapper. `Paradise' `Plain' `Do You Right' and `Hydroponic' are standouts."
1,bad cd,"this cd is pretty bad. I was so shocked to hear such bad music. This cd is a flop to there other ones. get soundsystem or transistor, not this."
5,311 at their Best!,"Oh, what energy these guys had back then! Whenever I turn on one of the whiny tracks of Transistor, or even the new tunes on Soundsystem, I inevitably yearn to get back to the hard, adrenaline-soaked songs of Music! I love this album! And though the more ""groovey"" songs on the album are great, you just cannot top 311 at their heavy best. ""Freak Out"" is the most Freakin' awesome song ever! People who roll their eyes at 311 fans and think 311 are a bunch of sissies, listen to this album. It does everything that made the blue album popular, but does it better. They had complete integrity and really strutted their stuff back then. High intensity fun tempered by soulful interludes. This album rocks and rolls, whatever you need it to do! Buy it NOW!"
5,This band is the pride and joy of my home town!!!!,"311 was raised in my home town of Omaha, Nebraska and they are about the only good band to come from around here. This album is a personal favorite of mine. Anyone who listens to this album and doesn't like it should not make judgements about the band and their other albums because they are an ever evolving group. I haven't found one of their cds that sounded just like another. Check them out more, I'm sure you'll like them!!!!!!!!"
2,"Ack - it's a clean, censored version!!!","Apparently iTunes only sells a clean version too,but they at least note that on the product page.... I do appreciate Amazon refunding my money after I listened to it and realized it was bleeping out the profanity, and had taken out the song ""Fat Chance"" altogether! I suggested to the customer service guy that they note the censoring on the page and he said he'd pass it along, but wanted to warn you other fans out there...."
4,On the lighter side,"This album isn't what I expected, but this was not a bad thing. Its a little more mellow compared to 311's later stuff. It has things combo of rock with a jazzy sound which I really dig. I would definitely recommend this album."
1,Not a true Gibson,"Did not completely fit. Had to customize it to make it fit. The listing states its a aggressive tone, I think my stock exhaust was louder. I wouldnt really recommend this if you are looking for a easy install, and a deep throaty tone."
1,Very Concerned!,"I purchased ""1000 4mm Bicone Swarovski 5328 Crystal Beads 25 Colors,"" according to the vendor's description on Amazon. The Swarovski label moved me to make this purchase. I just received my purchase, and I am alarmed. This is the label on the package: ""wholesale 1000 4mm Bicone, 28 crystal beads 25 colors, NEW."" There is no assertion that the crystals are Swarovski as promised. Unlike other Amazon purchases from vendors I have made of Swarovski crystals, this purchase does not label the crystals as Swarovski. To the vendor: did you sell me Swarovski crystals? Please respond."
5,Great product,These worked well as a gift for my mom who uses them in the jewelry that she makes. Great fillers and good quality beads.
3,Great crystals but approximately a third were not the advertised colors.,"These seem to be Swarovski crystals, and though I did receive 25 colors, 40 beads each, several of those listed colors were not included. Instead I received a few colors that were not listed."
3,Shedding yuck!,We've used this on our beagle/shepard mix for about a year now and at first it slowed up the shedding quite a bit - but now she is shedding a lot. Don't know if I will get any more.
4,Optima 365 Dog,"I've used this product for a few months now and I've seen a difference in the shedding. I have an American Bulldog and he sheds like there's no tomorrow. It's simple to use and works. I'm not sure of the exact percentage, but I'm guessing maybe 50%. There are some periods where my dog does shed a lot, but I guess that's just nature. I find myself not having to vacuum as much. I would recommend this product and will continue to use it."
1,Never recieved the correct product,"I only rated it 1 start because I have never received what I ordered. The reviews I read were good and I ordered. When it arrived it was the wrong item, not even close to what I ordered. I went throught the steps on Amazon to return twice and they have never responded or made any attempt to correct the issue. My dog does not have Urinary Track problems so I sure can't use the product they sent. There as no phone number to contact the seller and apparently the process in place does not work. I would just be careful when ordering from this seller. I have always trusted Amazon and have never experienced this kind of problem with them before. Product is good. Find another vendor."
1,Waste of Money,"Save your money and buy a good deshedding brush this product is a waste of money. Have been using it on my Great Dane and have not seen any less shedding. In fact, he seems to be shedding more."
1,Not worth buying at all.,"This cheap controller does not operate very well at all. It wears out within two weeks, then the buttons are inoperable and useless. The true problem with this Naki controller lies in the joystick. Since it is the most durable (not saying much) part of the controller, it lasts about about a day longer than the other parts. The stick then becomes very unsensitive in one direction. The Z button underneath the controller caves in very quickly with handling. If you want a true controller, buy something original, such as the Nintendo licensed material."
5,"A ""must have"" !","As a model railroader, I am interested in having freight and passenger cars that match the originals - one must not ""assume"" that the model makers have done any real research to produce an accurate model (you DO know what the word ""assume"" means, right??). [...] This book will set you straight - with both the excellant color photos and with the short but to the point discriptions of when (and sometimes how) the various cars were used.I have already ""saved"" the cost of this book by NOT buying several of those inappropriate ([...]) cars! Even on the ""good"" models, I have seen ways to ""alter"" my cars to make them more like the orginals - including the ""weathering"" seen in a lot of the photos.If you are really interested in the ""real"" Rock Island (CRI&P;) railroad, either as an historical ""railfan"" or as a model railroad builder, this book is a ""must have!"""
2,"I'm A Sports Junkie, And I Couldn't Read Past Page 50","To say this is a slow read is to say the Titanic was a sinking ship. In other words, it's stating the obvious. By the time I got to page 50, I was looking for a liferaft. Maybe something actually happens later on, but the publisher would have to pay ME to get there. I'd rather just buy the magazine - which at least is a good read."
1,Why Would Anyone buy this book?,The history of Highlights would be more interesting than this collection of boring anecdotes. Just about everyone this guy admires is about 120 years old. Their jokes seem like they come from the Civil War. B-O-R-I-N-G!
2,Quacky!,"Sadly, Mr. MacCambridge is not much of a writer. Sadder still, he curdles the milk of human kindness even as he dispenses it."
1,BORING,This book went too indepth on slow material and not enough indepth when there were interesting parts. The saddest part is that I am taking his class next semester
2,Why did he leave out all the good stuff?,"Sports Illustrated has been around for over 40 years, and this is as interesting as it gets? Surely there must be SOME compelling reason to buy this book. Why does the author have to drag us through pages and pages of uninteresting minutiae? And, sorry, Dan Jenkins is not up there on anybody's list of great writers. If S.I. was as boring as this book, it wouldn't have made its 4th anniversary, much less its 44th."
1,A Thimble-Deep Book That Doesn't Sound Honest,"Where are the insights? All I got was received wisdom and dull, dull prose. On top of that, I just don't trust this guy's taste. The book's too full of Middle America banalities. The author is lucky this didn't come with a money-back guarantee."
1,"There's No ""There"" There","Try as I did, I barely made it thorough this dry, rather unimaginative history. What insights it provided were hardly worth making. Better to subscribe to the magazine, which is not, as the author maintains, on the creative downside. Deford, Jenkins, et al. were no prose giants. In retrospect, they were lucky to have access to a vehicle that would print their second-rate blather. I much prefer today's writers. They're funnier, write more crisply and take sportswriting for what it is - entertainment."
4,History of SI,While doing a research paper on the history of SI I came across The Franchise. It was just what I was looking for. Being only a college student I had no clue how important SI was to the sporting culture in America. MacCambridge has done his research and this seems to be a very scholarly piece on something that generally is not too scholarly. It was a bit long but isn't it better to do more work than not to have done enough. I can't think of one issue about SI that MacCambridge didn't cover in this book. I am fortunate to have this book because it helps my research for my senior thesis.
5,Must read!! Top quality,"The slick gloss of the final product(the weekly SI magazine) is deceptive...none of the blood, sweat & tears is evident.An engrossing,eye-opening view of what was/is required to get the magazine out each week."
1,Not a very good history of S.I.,"This book fails on every count: as a history of the magazine; as a readable story; as a critical overview. The writing is just not very good, and insights and analysis sorely lacking. Who wants to read dull anecdote piled upon dull anecdote? Not me."
4,Lead guitar loud and proud on this one as it nearly cuts your ears off.,Man I think I unwrapped the vinyl the day the college radio station Monday Night Metal got this one and I copied it to cassette after the 2nd song started. I lost track how many times we cruised and smoked and blasted this one in the loudest van stereo in probably the Tri-state. Will scare the hell out of the posers.
4,"Not Quite Slayer, But...","WOW!!! I'd never heard of Blood Feast until just recently and I've been listening to thrash metal since the 80's. Did I ever miss out! These guys are really something! Great guitars, drumming and solid vocals. I am a believer and will get the rest of their albums for sure! If you like old school thrash, you must have this band in your collection!"
1,2 thumbs down,"After reading some of these reviews I was persuaded to buy this disc. DON'T you make the mistake I did. The fact is it really ""SUX"". Where do they get off saying it compares to KREATOR, SLAYER, Etc. What an insult to these premier bands. After listening to this disc I thought what an OVER rated band they were. I don't know how they got someone to produce it. They sound like a garage band and production quality sounds like it was recorded in a GARAGE! Very average musicians at best. You've been warned."
4,"Not as strong as Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. but still another slice of Pixar's brilliance. Much better than Cars 2!","""Pixar has done it again and brought somewhat of a revival to a slightly fading record of films like Toy Story 3 and Cars 2. Well, in the end, they thought the story of a rebellious young princess would be the framework of a Disney film but hasn't with its unique elements of neat and high-level graphics, not needy of a man scenario, and the historical component respectable to 12th-century Scotland. Like many Pixars, this one will always be in the conscience of someone who wants to work there. Don't fear the critics but bear in the mind that this isn't Toy Story or Monsters, Inc.-level of greatness. If you like Mulan or Princess Mononoke, you'll love Brave.""P.S. In some way or form, the film might be more interesting if having a Scottish Gaelic/Alba language track. Only enhances the experience and Pixar, from some's standpoint, wouldn't mind enhancing authenticity hopefully."
3,GOOD.,"The movie was good, but a bit dark for my four year old. At times she laughed, and she definitely enjoyed it. However, nightmares followed about the witch."
2,Meh,"Not real impressed, movie is dark (like in, needs to be seen in the theater) we have a 72"" TV and had all the lights out but the movie just was too dark and not a really well thought out story.Graphics are pretty good, the ones that can be seen"
3,"Love the movie, but it arrived scratched","By the time I got it and tried it out, the window for returns had closed. I think it's bull that now I'm stuck with a dvd of a movie I love, that I can't actually watch!"
3,Not the best,"I could not find myself caring about the lead characters. The story was predictable for an adult viewer. I could not really recommend it, which is unsual for me with a PIXAR movie."
2,Tasty but deadly poison for tweens,"Despite the quality animation, I could not identify with the decision of the main character to put her strict but caring mother in danger merely to satisfy her selfish ends. We were reminded of a standard Disney theme: headstrong young female defies parental authority and although her life is threatened and many other lives are put at risk, ultimately everyone has 'learned' from this selfish person and she is gloriously rewarded for her defiance.Yes she was unaware of the risks she was taking, but that's the definition of selfishness - not taking any time to consider the consequences your actions might have on others.`Tasty but deadly poison for 8-14 year old girls IMHO. My children will not be watching this film."
2,Pixar is in trouble!,I don't mind strong female characters but I don't need the fact that they are strong female characters to be constantly shoved in my face because I'm intelligent enough to figure that out for myself! This movie constantly shoved them in my face so much so that I ended up hating the strong female characters and I only finished watching the movie because I paid for it; I don't remember anything else about the movie.
2,Ham-fisted in a way that today's audiences will make excuses for,"No matter how trite the representation is (she's breaking free from the constraints of traditional roles, literally, bursting out of her ladylike outfit as she looses arrows) people will make excuses for this ham-fisted feminism because they're determined to play counter to traditional Disney princesses. The problem is this movie has zero of the charm of movies like Snow White, none of the fun characters, ridiculous 'According to Jim'-like portrayals of the majority of males, and an incredible lack of a real powerful villain such as we saw in past movies like Little Mermaid. It's too bad as it wastes Pixar's best visual effort, full of sprawling landscapes and great rendering on the main character's wild hair. After the mess of Cars 2 (and Cars 1 for that matter) it's unfortunate that Pixar is going in the wrong direction, but hey at least now people can stop whining that they haven't had a female lead in any of their movies."
2,wanted to like it,"We certainly liked Merida, but my oh my: the amount of what I call 12-year-old boy humor dominated the film. The men still dominated screen time, and the stupidity of most of the men (not to mention the violence) made this a thumbs down disappointment."
3,Brave,"Disappointing. I think the best parts were shown on the trailers and advertisements. Graphics special effects were wonderful, but lacking in storeline, I wanted more."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting another Tangled; boy, was I mistaken. Maybe it's because this is Pixar and not Disney outright, but I didn't think that would make a difference. The music isn't as good, and the second half of the movie dragged quite a bit. I thought the story line was a bit outlandish, even for a fairy tale, and somewhat confusing. I'd recommend renting this one first to make sure you like it - wish I had done so & saved the $20.P.S. My daughter is 2 1/2, and she was fine with the ""scary"" scenes."
3,Disappointed,A lame attempt to convey the complexities of the mother daughter relationship. Boring for kids and not entertaining for adults.
3,Neutral on Brave,"Beautifully drawn, but not much of story. Worth watching for the art, and there's a little humor there, but not enough to make up for a disappointing plot."
4,No way to go wrong with Disney Pixar,"The story is simple , the computer generated scenes are never a disappointment. We always look forward to the next Pixar film."
3,Doesn't feel like a Pixar movie,"The animation is breathtaking, but it just doesn't feel like a Pixar movie. The ""lesson"" is heavy and obvious, and could appear in any animated kid's movie. Usually I look forward to Pixar movies as incredibly layered and subtle. This one just didn't have subtlety."
2,"Marketed as an adventure, plays out like a fairy tale","This was an OK movie until the plot started, then it got weird. Probably OK if you were under 7 years old."
3,Christmas Present for GrandDaughter,"Pacakge came in time, I was able to purchase this cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere else, although I would've been happy to pay anything for my Baby Girls happiness. I'm sure she'll love it, can't wait till Chritmas!"
4,Brave,"Great movie for the kids in the family,,, best for the GIRLS, to booster there minds and make them BRAVER to face todays world!!"
3,"Worth watching, but not worth 4.5 stars!","This was a good family night movie, however I had to cover my 3 year old's eyes for all the scary bear scenes. Not a stellar movie in the ranks of UP or Toy Story."
3,It's potential exceeds it's accomplishment,"While an enjoyable watch, this title has a much greater potential. This film features music by one of the greatest Gaelic voices from Scotland, Julie Fowlis. Disney did not do badly. They simply could have done much better."
4,I had high expectations,"Like the title states, I had high expectations. It's Disney Pixar, I would have thought it deserved them. However I was disappointed. Yes, the movie had some entertaining parts, and over all I enjoyed it...but boy am I glad I didn't pay to go and see it in theaters."
2,US region,"The DVD is US region, this was not put in the description. As it was a gift, I threw out the envelope it came in before offering or trying it. I cannot return or play it - very disappointed."
4,Wonderful Movie - Great Visuals,"I was somewhat hesitant about the reviews I read. But after watching this, I can say that it is a really nice movie. I missed the prince charming. Regardless of what some think is unnecessary, that is what fairy tales are, so I missed it. That said, I loved that she was her own person and she made the right decisions to get out of a bind. This is what I want my daughter to do, be her own person, making her own decision and then finding the perfect prince charming, because he will be an awesome guy that respects her. Loved it."
4,Might be a little scary for toddlers.,"As an adult I loved the movie and the scenes of the landscapes were breathtaking. I watched it with my 2 and 4 year old grandchildren. They were really into it until the mean bear came into the movie then they started shouting turn it off, turn it off lol. It was a little to much for them. I do love the movie and plan on showing it to them when they get a little older."
4,Cute!,"Another wonderful princess movie by Disney.i wish the father was more involved since this family is actually all still together. It focuses on the mother/daughter relationship, and Merida and her mother both learn important lessons in the end.My 3 yr old likes it but found the parts with the bear to be slightly scary. I could see those parts giving little ones nightmares."
5,BRAVE,"BRAVE the movie is an excellent family movie, the picture quality is highand the story is simple, just for younger kids."
5,Spectacular!!,"I thought this video was spectacular. the voices and the animation were very well done and video was fun for both my wife and i and our children. just one caution: there are some scary scenes, you should be aware in case you have children that scare easily."
5,Amazing!,"Our 2 year old daughter loves this movie. She runs around yelling for ""Merda"" (her version of Merida). We like that Brave has strong women characters for our daughter to look up to."
5,Great Movie!,"I bought this movie for my daughter for Christmas to add to our Disney collection. She is a red headed, green eyed girl who thought Meridia was amazing. Very cute movie for the entire family to watch."
3,Good Family Movie,"I didn't watch it, but my grand children were transfixed. They loved it as did their grandmother. Good family viewing."
3,Google Prime browser use required to stream,"Wasted 24 hour of my 48 hour rental figuring out I had to not just update my updated Flash player. I had to down load the Google Chrome I cannot use on ATT Browser. Had to refuse to let it take over my Bing, AVG, and Yahoo Search engines.Had to open the google browser. Find Amazon. Sign on again. Find the Video both times I played it.Did not down load as well 2nd time I played it. Got kicked off line ATT twice in addition to intermittent streaming.Brave was OK, but violence reminds me of the type we got rid of in the 60's. Violence like in Oldest Disney Snow White and Bamby. I decided not to ad this dvd to my permanent library at any price."
2,Cute,"Brave did not surprise me, good or bad. The animated movie was cute but not deep enough to warrant admiration. The animation was good, but not great. It was ok for my wife and I to spend a couple hours of light entertainment. Good movie for elementary school age children."
3,brave,i bought it for a child from our church giving tree. it was for a 9 year old girl who wanted a movie.
2,story line was too boring,"Outline of the story was too pointed out for tweens or teenagers, predictable and hardly any funny elements in it. When you sit down to watch a cartoon, you expect to enjoy yourself. This was too boring."
5,Cute movie,"Very good movie. I usually don't like cartoons or pixar but this one I loved. Great story line about a mother and daughter, nice break away from the usual father son."
5,Great movie,"The family loves this movie, great job as usual. Beautiful picture. My daughter loves it and watches it every dau"
5,Amazing movie,A great family film :) I was able to get my whole family to watch it :) it's a must watch :D
5,Great children's movie.,"Brave has a fresh, child friendly storyline that's fun for adults as well. I look forward to more new stories in this genre."
5,Very Good,This movie was really good with a good message about making decisions as well as opening your eyes to no-traditional standard.
3,Brother Bear in Scotland,"Visual effects were very impressive, but the story was shallow and really a copy of Brother Bear. Brave was very funny at times, but not one of Pixar's best by any means."
5,Very Good Movie,"Very Good, exceeded my expectations. I will definetly buy this one for the wife's Disney collection. I would recommend to anyone with childred"
5,Great movie,My daughter love this movie. Brave was a cute and smart girl. Very funny and lots of action. Will see it again
3,Not what we hoped,"I personally enjoyed Brave, by my 10, 8 and 5 year old didn't understand it. Though they were entertained from start to finish, I had to explain the story to them. The bear fighting scene was a bit too much for my 5 year old."
4,Nice,We really Enjoyed this animated story. The characters (especially the triplets) were well done and lessons valid for all ages.
3,A mostly fun movie,"A critic described this movie as being ""more Disney than Pixar"". I have to agree. In the theater viewing the two things I enjoyed the most were the short called Luna (not certain if it is included with this dvd) and the princess' hair. Apparently each hair strand was distinctly animated. What the movie lacks is a good storyline. It starts out promisingly with the princess rebelling against a forced marriage but then descends into a typical Disney fairytale complete with comic relief characters, adults behaving childishly and the like. This is a good movie but it pales in comparison with classics like Spirited Away, Monsters Inc, and Toy Story."
4,Great movie even if a little slow at times!,"The kids enjoyed it, but at times the action seemed a little slow. I would still recommend it though it's a cute movie."
4,What an awesome heroine!,"I loved Merida - spunky, defiant, not afraid to stand up for herself. She has to be one of my favorite Princesses! Not only that, but she is smart - she figured out how to defy her mother at the competition that was set up to win her hand. I really liked how she did not want to bow to old traditions, and how she wanted to be her own person. I have to admit, I found her mother's character really grating at first, she was just so oblivious to her daughter's obvious frustration, and her father just stood by and let it happen, I wish he could have stood up for his daughter. The ending is a bit cliched, but it is overall a good movie."
4,solid entry,"While this falls into my second tier of pixar movies, it's still better than most. Good viewing for the whole family."
5,A frolic,"A fun film for a lazy weekend afternoon. Predictable, superficial, totally escapist. Loved the Celtic-flavored music and accents! There were several truly humorous moments as well."
3,Pretty cute,This movie was adorable to watch. Loved the animation and the story line. Would recommend to an audience of kids under 12 years of age.
4,Cute movie,Surprisingly we rented this for our 4 boys at their request and they loved it. It really was a cute movie.
5,Great!,"What a great movie! The kids loved it, as did I. It's one you watch again and again. I recommend it for anyone's movie collection."
5,Love it! First Mother/Daughter film,Loved the film. It was amazing. Love the plot line. Complete Mother/daughter film. First film in a long time that addresses the issues that mothers and daughters have.
4,Not bad...,I thought the movie had a great storyline. The animation is also very impressive. I liked the humor they included in the story which kept the theme light hearted.
5,3 stars for the movie and 2 more for the service,The movie is average.The picture quality provide by amazon was not up to the mark.Amazon realized that and refunded the cost of the movie!! Thank you :)
3,Nice story for children,"It is true to the Disney tradition. Princess has a delema, and needs to figure out how to solve it. Everything neatly wrapped up by 5 min. before the end of the movie. I recommend it for girls esp. ages 5-10"
4,Another classic,"This is a film for grown ups. Younger audience might not enjoy this as much as the other productions.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, it is because it is the same story as Finding Nemo. Justdifferent characters and different setting, but the idea and lesson behind it are the same."
4,Very good not quite 5 stars,"We enjoyed it, the story kept us going and we loved the accents. Great movie for all ages. How do they do that hair?"
5,Excellent!,"All my family enjoyed the movie. The movie itself leaves a good message for young generations, it's a must see."
5,Loved it,"I love this move and so do my grand kids, they watch it over and over. So if you have grand kids they will love this move."
2,eh...ok,"This film is really more for girls....ginger fire snaps needs a haircut. I have three young boys and they got kind of bored with brave. On the other hand they loved Madagascar 3. Basically its a story of a free spirited and rebellious skinny teenage girl with a massive hairdo who doesn't want her parents to force her into marriage. Her passion is riding her enormous clydesdale horse (Angus) and shooting arrows at stuff... similar to hunger games in that regard, also found it similar to disney's tangled. Worth a rental I guess, I wouldnt buy it... especially at disney's inflated prices. The animation is beautifully done though and it looks really good on BD"
3,Boring,"I did not like it - usually Disney - Pixar movies are good, but this one put us all to sleep."
4,pixar,pixar enough said they always turn out a great product. great animation and great stories. look forward to many more from them
2,Not as good as expected.,"When this came out we thought it would be a good family movie. My one daughter enjoyed it, the rest of us thought it was really boring."
2,"Great animation, cute characters---boring, typical storyline!","I love the Scottish accents, the characters, and quality of animation! But the storyline was the typical boring storyline....Princess is forced to find a mate, doesn't want to get married, but forced by parents, finds true love! Boring! Been done for decades!"
1,not what I expected,"We watched this movie for our family movie night and found it to be lacking greatly in content, character and plot development and just really low end compared to other disney/pixar movies."
2,Boring,"Was not impressed with this one. Poor character development and humor not that funny. We liked the storyline and think they could have done a lot more with it. We were hoping for something like ""the incredibles"" but brave fell very short."
3,expected better,"it was a cute movie but i expected a little better. I'd wait until it's free on cable. It may make you chuckle, but, honestly - wait."
2,Boring for a Pixar movie,"As an adult, I realize this movie is targeted at me directly, my daughter enjoys watching Brave. This is the worst of the Pixar movies in my opinion. Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc and others are very enjoyable, this one has a really bad plot, and no characters you fall in love with. I would rather watch Finding Nemo for the 25th time than watch this for the second time."
5,Excellent Movie,"Sometimes Pixar really comes up with a great story... We watched this film the day after Thanksgiving (Wife, Mother, Step-Father, Daughter(3 years old), and me.We all loved it, it even made my Mother cry... :) My little girl found a couple parts to be a bit scary, but she loved the movie and has already re-watched it a few times."
1,!!!BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,Beware! It's not a Disney movie!It's not a Pixar movie!After the first 15 mn I really felt uncomfortable and God knowshow much I usually love Pixar and Disney.Finally I hated it.It only takes one person to have a bad marriage.Brave is a result of this marriage.Unfortunately some beautiful images didn't fool me.Lack of everything and no substance.What a shame!My wish upon a star: I hope BRAVE will push Pixar and Disney to divorce...
1,Brave,"I give this NO stars!! I had to do 1 tho to submit my review(SADLY)Not for children! She's very disrespectful, tons of WITCHCRAFT which my children shall not see or participate. It's all scary--not really funny at all! Very serious and adult like! Horrified at Disneys idea of family and children with this movie! Such a shocker! my kids when we started watching cried and begged to turn off because it was so scary!! Would never have in my home or recommend to buy. What a disappointment and let down with Disney! Parets MUST watch first--PLEASE CONSIDER!"
1,brave,did not get to watch the movie so I do not know how good it was. sorry it was to late toowatch time expired
2,Horribly Dissapointing---Worst Pixar Film By Far,"The basic problem with Brave is just how inconsequential the plot is. The heroine protagonist is charming, but unfortunately nothing interesting happens to her. The film feels over before it even began, and the themes are so provincial its hard to really get involved on the scale of a film. Its almost feels more like an extended medieval Scottish sitcom.Without spoiling anything, the flame haired lead, Merida has to break an unwanted spell. The way the spell is broken turns out to be so simplistic and lacking in obstacles, that the movie has to invent a bunch of very weak contrivances to pad out the film's finale. The only audience for this film is very young children, if that."
5,A 3 year olds dream,"My 3 year old Granddaughter just loves this Movie. Having a female heroine is perfect for her. the first time she watched it she turned to Grandma and said, ""Grandma, can I go their and play too"" ."
1,Good movie but HATE amazon instant video,The movie is pretty good and I generally liked it. I purchased this movie with the intent of watching it on my TV via Apple TV and because I couldn't download a specific file I was unable to put into my apple library with all my other movies. Similar to what I would do if I downloaded a CD. This is unacceptable and therefore I bought the same exact movie from Itunes so I don't have to log into some stupid app that I can download but only watch the movie on my ipad or iphone. I guess I should have read the fine print a little better before my purchase so buyer beware .
1,Brave,I don't know because for a couple of days my kindle would not ever pull anything up after I rented it! so I only saw the first 5 minutes :( I should get a refund!
2,horrible story,"worst pixar story to date, visuals looked great though. but that can only take it so far. two stars at best"
2,TERRIBLE DON'T LET YOUR CHILDREN WATCH,"this movie was so upsetting! Witchcraft, grown men showing their naked behinds,and a little girl calling her Mom a BEAST! How dare they make such a cartoon and let children watch it. Children are so impressionable and they shouldn't create such movies."
5,Kids will dig this,My wife and I decided to watch this one evening. We were both greatly entertained. I would recommend this to just about anyone.
5,Great family entertainment,"So refreshing to see a uplifting, funny, non-voilent movie. Done beautifully I might add. Fun for parents and children, or adults who are young at heart."
4,"Not Pixar's Best, But Pretty Darn Good!","I really like Brave, I really do, but this review is just going to come out sounding very negative, even though on it's own, Brave is a very good movie.The story was good, but it seemed to be a story that's been done before. Kind of like Brother Bear, except with a mother-daughter relationship instead of a pair of brothers.The characters in this movie, were, to me, pretty unlovable. Merida herself I found to be very immature at times. I know this is a coming of age story, but she seemed to just be extraordinarly whiny at times. I did enjoy her brother's antics, they were probably the high point of the movie for me.The music was good, though not very memorable.The animation was beautiful!Overall it was a good movie, it just doesn't compare to Toy Story and Up as far as leaving an impression and being really remarkable goes. And as the first Pixar movie aimed at a female audience, I'd had really high hopes for it."
1,Practically Unwatchable,"This movie was dull, trite and silly (not the good kind of silly). The graphics were great, but the story was tedious and predictable."
2,modern brat,"i know that more and more kids are becoming brats, but Disney seems to have decided to endorse the same behavior."
2,terrible,Seriously! the worst. all Disney and Pixar do anymore is slop together junk and make a ton of money off of us lemmings.at least I didnt waste too much money or gas.thank god for streaming. Even my daughter thought it was lame.
5,Pixar always great,"You can't go wrong with a Pixar movie, so well done and the story is very entertaining and super spellbinding for children. My granddaughter loves it and would watch it every day if she could."
3,Brave,Cute movie. Pixar really does a great job. Rec'd on time and in good condition. Would purchase more of these products
5,Well Done!!,Fantastic my grand kids loved it!! Especially since they got to see it in the 3D version. Loved the expressions and reactions from them.
5,Great for kids and adults.,Has a good message for adults and a beautiful story for kids. We enjoyed the video with our grandkids. Great!
4,Good Disney flick,"If you are considering a Disney flick to watch with the kids, this hits the mark. Its typical Disney themes, independent kids, parents don't understand, villain to be dealt with, and a renewed understanding at the end. Keltic based background, the visuals are striking at times. Not Avitar, but definately Pixar. Lots of funny stuff going on. The boys are really cool. Be prepared for a heart tugger along the way, but don't worry about the ending... Hey, its Disney."
4,Great movie for kids and adults alike,"The movie was great and had a good story line that even my 3 year old could follow. The animation was fantastic, even in Standard Definition."
4,Very nice and funny movie,"Very nice and funny movie, my kid enjoyed it very much and we also liked it. A nice story and different one too."
5,Another Pixar triumph.,"A beautiful little tale. Not as sweeping and epic as UP, WALL-E or even CARS, but affecting and exciting in a more subtle and less bombastic manner. See it."
4,A Different Kind of Fairy Tale,"I love animated movies, so I looked forward to Brave and wasn't disappointed. The plot was a new and different type of story, and I got caught up in it right away. Animated films set in Scotland are not common. The young heroine, Merida, won my sympathy right away, and I wanted her to come out on top. All in all, it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, even for a 79-year-old man. My only complaint was that some of the dialogue in the Scottish brogue was very difficulty to understand. I would recommend checking to see if subtitles are available on the DVD."
3,I don't know anything about it.,I have never read it or seen the movie. I think my son and grandchildren will like it I want to say thank you
4,Awesome movie had it in mere minutes!,"Downloaded the movie via amazon instant video and had access to it on iPhone, iPad, roku, blu ray and Mac in about 2 minutes we started watching. Great movie, lots of comedy. But it does have a few moments that were too scary for our 4 year old daughter."
4,Love it.,We watched this movie 3 times the first night we bought it. If you have a daughter its a great movie for girls to understand why their mothers do what they do. Because they love you!.
3,Okay for rental - but would've been disappointing if we paid movie-theater prices,The story line was okay. Characters okay. We loved the Scottish accents though. But I hold Disney movies to a higher standard.
2,go with Mulan or beauty and the beast instead,character is mostly obnoxious - movie is too loud and the scenery is all very dark making it hard to see the characters
3,Not Pixar at it's best.,A pleasant little fairytale... but not up to the Pixar standard. The moral was a little vague. Plenty of smiles though.
2,Disappointing,"Movie is extremely disappointing. Instead of a strong female heroine, which is what one is led to expect by the marketing, it's just another female dealing with the expectations of her parents, her 'position' in society.....Very disappointing movie, and in addition it's boring, cliche, trite.....small children who are not critical thinkers will probably enjoy it, but no one beyond that."
5,Great movie,No one in our family had seen this....now we just need to get a blue ray player to enjoy the rest of the disks.
2,Surprised Pixar put this out,"Considering its a Pixar movie, I had higher expectations on the story, which is dull and boring at times and predictable for the most.Visually is a stunning movie, but Pixar excels at the technical details.Other than that I was kind of disappointed."
2,Meh,Mediocre delivery for a Pixar film. Never really builds up to anything that makes you really care. Pixar seems to be losing their storytelling mojo.
4,Good for Kids,"Like her Hair...too short too little magic. Like her accent too..over all good family entertainment.Younger kids won't mind, but many viewers accustomed to relying upon Pixar for something special will feel a sense of letdown due to the lack of adventurousness."
3,Feminist Propaganda,"The movie was average at best. The movie had no real plot and I had already seen the funny parts in the commercials. If you like leftist feminists cartoons, this movie is for you. If you are a guy who is tired of guy bashing, stir away from this movie."
4,she's cool,Very good condition. This is one of my favorite pixar disney films yet. I may take up archery myself. Merida is one cool female character.
2,Not up to Disneys standards,Graphics are pretty good as like any other disney movie but the story plot and the drama part is not up to the mark.the best measure is: my 6 years old didn't shown much interest while watching this movie. we both watched many other disney movies to gether i know her interest on the disney movies. eg. Secret of the wings (she watched it 6 times) and she didnt even asked to watch this movie second time...that shows how miserably disney failed in presenting this movie.
3,I don't know what I was expecting.,"Pixar is amazing, I'll watch anything they make because I have an incredible appreciation for animation and art.That said, this is one of their worst films to date. The story is incredibly familiar, like five old Disney movies mashed into one; except, there's no climax to the story, it's just a goofy Saturday morning cartoon script stretched over an hour and given amazing production values. It even bores my 3-year-old niece.Also, the 3D is really boring. There's really not much depth here, and the 3D is almost completely and totally unnecessary. Halfway through the film I had forgotten it was even in 3D.This one is a pass... but thankfully Finding Nemo 3D will be here soon."
3,Meh,Seems like a collage of several other animated films. It's enjoyable without making history. At last a female heroine who isn't trying to get princed!
5,love this movie,my whole family loves Brave! my husband and almost 6 year old and i have watched it multiple times! definitely would rec to a friend :)
5,Awesome,excellent movie it was so invigorating and merada is a young girl who just wants to liv her own life.
5,Bought the movie for my wife,"She watches it time and time again, one of the few disney movies they put out now adays and it seems to be wonderfully done and brought many smiles... it was a good job done and I enjoyed"
3,Gorgeous yet overdone plot line,"Well visually, musically, acting, etc, it is all up to disney pixar standards, except where the plot line goes. It's the same typical plot line I have seen in a million movies, and not even remotely hid or spun into a new concept. Kinda disappointing, but pretty."
3,Okay,My son was mostly entertained but for me it was not very good. My son didnt ask to watch it again which also tells me it was average at best.
4,Great for kids and adults - not too Disney-esque,"I really enjoyed this film, 3 adults watched it, no kids, we loved it. It had lovely scenery (something I never imagined saying for an animated film), a somewhat unpredictable story, and was just plain fun to watch. It was cute, but not sickly sweet, nor was it over the top goofy pie-in-the-face to appeal to 7 year old boys stereotypical crap so many animated films have nowadays. Bravo for Brave, this film has much more of the flavor of the old Pixar films, less of the typical Disney film, which is a good thing. And the other good thing: it is devoid of cliches and violence, so I highly recommend it for kids."
4,Now that I own it...,"Loved it in the theater, love it even more now that I own it and can watch it at anytime."
5,Great movie,"I really like this movie in addition to kid-o really, really liking it. I like the story, and the characters are well written."
5,One of the best movies ever!!!,"Brave is fun, fun, fun. Merida is such a hoot. What a good role model for making your life what you want it to be . . . and not following the path someone else sets for you. And what a great picture of Scottish quirkiness. The characters voiced by real life Scots have a great sense of fun and disregard for social conventions. They are focused on having a good time, competing fiercely, and rolling with whatever punch comes their way. Not to mention the amazing graphics which make Merida's hair an unbelievable work of interesting art. I loved this movie!"
5,Loved it,Great movie for for the whole famlie the kids and i loved the whole storie it was great lesson for the kid's on how famlies get along loved it
5,Great for Boys & Girls.!!!,"My kids enjoyed this one.!!! My son enjoyed this cartoon just as much as my daughters, so did I. I had to watch it two times to and of course the second time is always better than the first time..."
2,Started off great....,My kids got terrified halfway through the movie and I had lost interest myself. It just wasn't what Pixar used to be.
5,Stream nicely. kids loved it.,The kids loved it. It streamed quite nicely. They shut up for 2 hours and it was some of the best peace and quiet ever.
5,Wonderful empowering film for girls,"First movie without a romantic interest. Instead it focuses on a girl growing into her own and trying to find herself in a world where she doesn't see eye to eye with her mother. Thoroughly enjoyed it and to everyone who has an issue with the ""nudity"".... Grow up and stop being a prude!"
5,I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe,"I have to admit that, because this movie is about a Princess, I expected a typical Disney tale about a heroine who has very Big Hair. I was pleasantly surprised that the movie is unconventional enough to hold the attention of a jaded adult. This is a Pixar movie, and it is entertaining on different levels at the same time. As a parent who has juggled multiple children and pets, some of the family scenes reminded me of my own household so much that I had a laughing fit."
1,Not work it,Kids questioned plot as did we. And they are little. Just didn't enjoy or find it worth our family time
1,Save your money!,I'm glad I got this DVD on sale and did not pay full price; it is really bad; what my wife and I especially hated was that most of the action took place in the dark or at night and you as the viewer cannot see anything; this happened most of the film. What a rip-off; I wish I could get all my money back.
1,"Beware, non-standard DVD",The DVD protection prevents this from playing on computers and some DVD players. Use another format or netflix for this title. Disney has a reputation for these problems.
1,Brave,"Love the movie, but, the blu-ray stops about two minutes into the movie. This is on a new blu-ray player. Have not had te to return per busy life with two small children. Expect, at this point, Zi am stuck with defective disc."
