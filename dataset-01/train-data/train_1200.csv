3,Siberian night light,It did not turn out to what I was expecting. The price is way too high for the quality really.
2,A great summary of the life of Adam Sandler.,"This book, Adam Sandler: Not Too Shabby, is a great look at the life of Adam Sandler. Starting in his days as a child, this book tell most everything in the life of this crazy movie star's life. Revealed in this book are alot of the secrets behind Adam's movies. Not only do you learn about Adam, you also get to learn about some of his co-stars from his movies. This easy-to-read book is great for all ages but I wouldn't recommend it unless you like Adam Sandler and his movies."
4,good,my son had to complete a project at school about someone famous. his favorite actor is Adam Sandler and this was a great resource for his project.
3,Not for the 70's generation,"The ultimate problem, though it's better than some VHS's in this category, runs through all levels of production.The music basically doesn't change and is dubbed over with ""Dr. Devious'"" message, which really messes up the overall effect, imo.There are repeated graphical scenes of people that only make sense with the volume up, making this video messed up by that when playing to your own music choice.Some of the scenes go on a bit too long or are too brief, mostly lacking enough color changes or have too many ""objects"" over the color changes. One scene, in particular, of a blue man running, is really tiresome.If you were born in the 60's-70's and got lost in ""Spirograph"", this video will leave you looking for another."
4,Its Good,"Yaknow, its hard to put a collection together that hasn't been done already, there are alot of collections out there, but good luck finding them, most are either repeats or out of print, this is a good collection, not great, but good, keep ya interested. Ed Gorman usually does find the ones that are forgotten or not main stream and good enough to fill a book. Recommended for any who likes short horror."
2,Stories may be dark but they certainly aren't fantastic.,"There is no doubt that Ed Gorman is a very talented writer, and two or three of the stories in this anthology show his strengths quite well. But the majority of them are simply made up of tired and shop worn noir nightmare cliches. I found myself skimming over whole paragraphs just to make it through all the morose atmosphere to the 'twist' ending I had figured out as soon as the story began. If you must read this then these are the stories I would recommend - Yesterday's Dreams, Different Kinds of Dead, and The Face. The rest you have probably read before in some form or another by other writers."
2,Nothing fantastic here!,"What do you do when you run out of material and have fragments of uncompleted novels? You put them together in this book and have(or pay)a ""friend"" write a glowing introduction. Bentley Little begins the intro by stating Ed Gorman is a writer's writer. Bentley Little also didn't read the entire book.The sci-fi shorts are okay. The ""horror"" predictable. There's a story in here called ""Rite of Passage"" which reminds me of an Aesop fable. There's also a couple of stories about hitchhikers, serial killers and a blind woman with a healing touch. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone I know. 2 stars for the sci-fi."
3,The Dark Fantastic,This is a good collection of short stories. Not a great one! I would say 10 of the 17 stories are average or above average. I think that the reason a lot of readers do not like short story collections is that there is an inconsistancy about the writing. That certainly holds true for this book.
5,Groovy bit,"My current dado blade was chipping through the oak veneer plywood (against the grain) I'm using to build display cabinets. Before I spent $200+ for a better blade, I gave this router bit a try.It works great, one thin pass through the veneer, and a final pass to get to 3/8"". No chips, no shredding.I also bought the 50"" back-to-back clamp, routed across the full width of the sheet, and then cut the plywood to width."
5,"Relief, Peace and Sleep","We use a lot of organic products in our household and we tried the Horizon Organic infant formula once it came on the market.None of the formulas worked on my son; he had sever colic and intestinal gas issues. We treid every remedy we possibly could to help our son; nothing worked. My wife and I did not get much sleep and neither did he because of the digestive problems with other milk based protein formulas. His Pediatrician told us to get this formula and see if it makes a difference; it did wonders in 24 hours. In addtion, we researched colic aids and found another great product called Colic Ease which our son likes and it really works too."
4,Neat little mouse,"As an unspectacular, functional foray into the world of optical mousing, this is a well-priced mouse with a good shape and feel, as well as a nicely-calibrated scroll facility.There's little point in installing the bundled software, as any version of Windows from 2000 onwards will pick it up and detect it as an optical scroll-wheel mouse without problems, and allow you to tweak all the necessary settings through the default 'mouse' dialog box in Control Panel.The 'pointer jumping to random points on the screen' peculiarity is usually a feature of the mousing surface you use. Use too-shiny a mousemat and the optical detector picks up false reflections and can make it think the mouse has moved a significant distance. Keep the alcove clear of dust and use a fabric surface to 'mouse' on and it should be fine.Overall a good little mouse and one that I enjoy using for high-speed games without complication."
2,Uncomfortable,"This mouse slides very nice and is very accurate. Unfortunately, it's the most uncomfortable mouse I've ever used. My right ring finger sits right on the pointy edge. I tried to get used to it, but I will be returning it tomorrow in exchange for something else."
5,New folk music of the Pacific.,"From the shores of Anacortes to the thickets of Quinault, people get yer microphones and listen to these songs."
2,Try the video,"I've owned the book for two years; I read well, and am a serious pianist. Yet I have not penetrated beyond the first quarter of the book. The author's prose is not tangled, nor troubled by academic jargon. It has, however, a creepily lobotomized quality. One feels as if one is translating each sentence into human speech as one reads: a tedious process. The content appears useful and trustworthy."
3,"Not one of her best, but still great!","I am a huge fan of Amanda Ashley. She writes more of the dark vampire than the sparkly vampire. This was one of her earlier books that I somehow had missed when reading her books. This one started out great. I loved the first chapter. I love how Kara's younger sister goes looking for a vampire to save her sister, even though Gail herself is very young. That sets the book in motion. I liked the plot and the dark brooding vampire Alexander. What I didn't like was Kara. To me, she came across as stupid and ditzy. I don't know if they yanked out her brain during the coma or if she is just naturally clueless. I will say that this book was not like most of the authors vampire books. Even though I couldn't stand Kara, I still enjoyed the story."
1,Spoilers...but obviously not a fan of this book,"Ok in reading reviews it seems like maybe it's an age thing, but I hated this book. I have read Amanda Ashley before and enjoyed her books but not this one. The heroine is somewhat.....helpless/flaky in my opinion. It just seemed like she had no common sense at all! I mean the ""twist"" that the other reviews had, ehh, I was ok with it, it was really the romance, which made me gag at times, and the fact that the heroine seemed stupid. I mean, if you know you are being hunted, why on earth would you keep calling your family to check in and then show up there? Why not ask how the family member in the hosipital is doing? But no ""OH I know I'm being hunted but I MUST go running to my family without knowing if they are ok and risk getting captured!"" If you are thinking of buying this book, just say no!"
1,Very disappointing! :(,"I usually like these kind of romance novels, but although the descriptions were colorful, the heroine seemed to be contradicting herself at every turn. She was obsessed with religion. Now, I don't mind a bit of religion, in fact, I think it adds a nice tone to stories, but the Heroine had a preoccupation with her own religion (that I feel the author was trying to convert people with) that would not have allowed her to make many descisions later on. And, I know I won't tell the end, but that Vampire thing was the worst part because, well, it was just EXTREMELY disappointing."
1,YUCK!,"this is one of the dumbest books i've ever read. I felt cheated, you know. ashley had me totally fooled for the first few pages. i thought i was having a vampire cruise. i thought i was having a helluva time. i thought it was a good buy. i thought WRONG!!!! the sexy 'vampire' turned out to be an alien, and the rest of the story goes down the drain from that moment of unveiling. okay, there is such a thing as letting the reader have a bit of suspense, but there is also such a thing as cheating the reader into believing something so dumb!!! oh, i hate this book. when i discovered the hero was an ALIEN, i jumped up and down on my bed in disbelief, threw the book across the room and didn't bother to pick it up until after the next spring-cleaning day. my advice: when you see this book, forget it. you will thank me for saving your precious time."
5,Deeper than the Night,"I enjoyed reading this book, Amanda Ashley is a talented author and makes you want to believe! Keep the books coming!"
3,disappointing...,"Okay, so the author tricked us-- a lot of writers do that. What bothered me was how *contrived* the trick was. It wasn't very well done, and the long ""book within a book"" passages tended to be distracting rather than intriguing.The writing wasn't very good, especially when compared to some of Amanda Ashley's other books. The characters tend to whine a lot, and they rehash the same issues so many times that you want to beat them over the head. They're also excessively mushy (even for a romance novel), but then again you might like that sort of thing. In my opinion, though, this book is not worth the shipping and handling charges."
1,Leaves a bad taste in your mouth,"This book had to have had one of the worst so-called heroines that I've ever read. She was such a whiney little ditz that at times I found myself wanting to throw the book across the room in frustration and stop reading. But I kept struggling through to the end hoping that the alien vampire concept would win out and make this a worthwhile read. It didn't. Without revealing specifics all I can say is that there are plot holes galore, numerous convenient coincidental occurrences, uninspired sex scenes, and an absurd ending. Skip it."
3,"Paranormal romance with a twist, or two.","Gail Crawford sneaks off in the middle of the night to pay a visit to Moulton Bay's most reclusive resident, Alexander Claybourne. She, and several other local children, believe that Claybourne is really a vampire in hiding. Gail hopes that Alexander will use his dark magic on her sister Kara, who has been injured in a car accident, to save her life. Alexander explains to the girl that he is not a vampire and turns her away. But he cannot stop thinking about the injured woman and visits her in the hospital. While there he succombs to the urge to give her some of his blood. Claybourne may not be a vampire, but he acts like one and is not human. I enjoyed this paranormal romance, despite it having a ludicrous suspense plot. Not great, but it held me in its spell until the end, which is all I ask from a book."
1,What the????,"Awful...Just Awful. I'm all for a little magic and surprises are always good, but this was just plain stupid. I was really ticked off! The book looked alright, had potential, could have been alright...then BAM! JUST KIDDING! VAMPIRES ROMANCE? NO NO, WE REALLY MEANT SPACE ALIENS! What on Earth (no pun intended), I honestly had to back track and re-read a little way to make sure that I actually read it correctly! I forced myself to finish the book because I just knew that the man had to be lying, attempting to cover up his vampirism or something...ANYTHING!!! Anything else would have been okay. Very unrealistic, not only the plot, but the time it took them to fall in love, and well lets just say most of the book. My sincere appologies to Amanda Ashley, I'm sure she does great work, but seriously, Deeper Than the Night, was really lame."
5,CTEK Multi US 7002 12V Battery Charger,Worked great as I was able to de-sulfate the battery in my Lincoln. After doing that the battery lasted me antill I thought it went bad again but it was actually the starter that caused the slow cranking. Also used it to revive an Optima battery I thought was dead. Also charges my batteries faster than the smaller battery tender that I had before this unit. Def would recommend this unit iver a battery tender as it has more uses.
5,Awesome,Bought this to use with gel-pack batteries for my boat. Now I use it for all my batteries. Great product!
5,Excellent!,"Great product! Simple controls, plug in, attach to battery, power on and it does all the rest.-Self contained and portable-Fused cables-Storage pouch-2 sets of cables-Reverse polarity protection-Turns on and off when needed so it doesn't over charge"
2,CTEK Charger,Not so good.It did not last a day.I am not even sure it worked at all.It just got hot.I wish it did work.Maybe I just got a lemon.
2,Product assistance does not exist.,"Product does not appear to be functioning as advertised. Attempts to contact supplier via e-mail and phone did not address problems.CTEK should be added to the World Wide ""No Buy List""."
4,GREAT for the price so far,I purchased this unit to replace my battery tender that has worked great for so many years .I only went with this unit due to all the features it had to offer for the price .I must say so far I am very happy with the quality and the performance of this unit ..i can only give it 4 out of 5 since i have not had it long enough to rate the quality of durability vs my battery tender so far it is out performing it thow.
5,Small up-front investment will save you hundreds down the line,"Today's modern vehicles put a lot of strain on the battery, so if you only drive your vehicle occasionally (or park it for the winter), you absolutely have to invest in a some sort of battery maintenance tool. While the CTEK 3300 is enough for most vehicles; if you have a high-performance vehicle, I would strongly suggest you invest an extra ~$50 in the 7002 model. It has several modes and an 8-step charging cycle to ensure your battery is kept in top condition. Much cheaper than having to buy a new battery after only a few years!"
5,CTEK's Best Chargers,"I bought two of these and they work great. Using one for my garage queen and the other for my 2500HD. Super easy to use, comes with connection cables and carrying bag. Customer service has been decent as well. Currently working with them on a charging design for a new project. Would easily recommend."
3,It's OK,"Can't tell if the battery was reconditioned or not. It has no volt meter, this battery charger doesn't tell you anything."
5,Excellent charger!,"I use the CTEK charger on my 1997 Dodge Viper GTS. Unfortunately the car doesn't get driven as much as it should so it sits in the garage most of the time. I had an Optima red top that lasted only about a year. The replacement battery, an Optima yellow top was on a BatteryTender until it stopped working. I replaced it with the CTEK charger several years ago and the Optima is still running strong at around 6 years old. I have it hard wired with the quick disconnect so I don't even need to lift the hood to connect and disconnect it."
5,The best charger possible for Optimas!,This is an amazing charger. It renews my Optimas where every other charger I have tried to use ends up destroying them. I am glad to have found this great piece of machinery. I threw out all my other junk chargers. Worth the money hands down!
2,not really that great if you are looking for a training vid.,I was expecting to see roy jones doing crazy boxing/conditioning drills. I was let down. He is trained by some high pitched guy who is very distracting and does not motivate at all. The video quality/production value is pretty poor too. The only reason I give it two stars is for RJJ. He is the man.
2,Very disappointing,"After the good review in the New York Times, this book was a major disappointment for me. I found the characters charmless (the protagonist was especially irritating), the dialogue unsubtle and unnatural, and the plot complications overconvoluted and unbelievable. I did keep reading to the end, because there was a certain thrust to the narrative and because I wanted to find out what the solution was without jumping ahead. Also, the Australian setting adds a certain amount of interest."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"The moisture sensor is too sensitive and there's no way to turn it off.The light bulb lasted 3 months, and the replacement bulb offered seems to be no improvement.The seasonal setting is annoying and there's no way to turn it off.The seasonal indicator light, plus the constantly flashing indicator light for the moisture sensor (if you don't use it, in use it's a second glowing red light), will irritate anyone who gets them in their line of sight for extended periods of time (office mates) so you'll have to find a way to hide them from view."
2,"quality has ""slipped"" from first ones I purchased","I have purchased a few of these now and decided when the next one went""out"" I was going to return it, but wouldn't you know by the time I got around to it the expiration date was a few weeks ago! I like the looks and having these lights, but the last two or three have not lasted too long--quality seems to have slipped. barbaraj mungenast"
2,Now rating this product a '2',"After two years with this lamp, I am now experiencing a problem with the lamp flashing on and off. No amount of resetting it makes the light stay on now (and I replaced the bulb for $13 which was a waste). I would not recommend buying this product; even though I got 2 good years out of it, there is no reason for it to break like this. Do not buy!"
1,Naver lasts,"Unit 1: 13 months; Unit 2: 5 months. Both times replace bulb and neither worked. Checked wiring - OK. Must be the controller. Nice when it works, but will never buy again."
3,A Bit Frustrating,"I bought two of these lights for my children's bonsai trees. I will say that I like the design of this light. It is compact and fits easily in their rooms. The electronics, however, are a bit problematic. As other reviewers have noted, you must plug it in around sunrise, if you are planning on using the built-in timer. But I have noticed that that timer only works for about a week, and then the light will no longer come on. If I unplug it, wait a bit, and plug it in again, it will work properly for another week or so. Perhaps they are defective, but since I don't plan to keep them plugged in all the time, I can live with it. I just wish that there was a switch so you could choose to use the built-in timer, or plug it into your own timer."
1,"2 weeks, already broken","I bought this for the office, brought it in in the box. Unpacked it here, plugged it in and it lit up. Set it to spring. Two weeks later and it is not lighting up at all. tried different sockets for the plug. Nothing. Since it worked for a week I threw the box away so now I can't return it. Lame. Never buying Glentronic again."
3,Good but quality control lacking,"I have 10 of these lamps. The orchids in my collection under these lights bloom consistently. I think they have made a real difference because I live in MN and our days are very short in winter and day light is insufficient. The 1st 3 I ordered 2 years ago were of higher quality than what is available now. The transformer was larger and the lamps last longer in these units. The computers are still working and they set up without a problem. Of the newer ones, one computer has failed, the light does turn on and off but it does not cycle through the seasons like it should. Bulbs are $10.00 each and last about 6 months. I keep bulbs on hand because they have been out of stock at least twice in the last 2 years and they are hard to find. If you get a good Intelligent light they are great but in my small sample the chance of a poor quality lamp is about 20-30%."
1,Not so smart plant light...,"At first, I loved it. The only problem was waking up early to get it plugged in and running to normal daylight hours; but then, barely one month later, it's dead. Not just the bulb either. So now I have a big black paper weight that I have to figure out how to return/replace. I hope this is just bad luck and the new one works for a lot longer than 30 days. Amazon, what gives?"
1,Working Replacement Bulbs Unavailable!,"I bought this for my Venus fly traps at work. The light itself works great when you get it. However, eventually that bulb is going to burn out. Of course, the only people that make the correct light bulb are the vendor. You *can* purchase the vendor's light bulbs here. I bought 2- and while the bulbs were fine, the connection wasn't. The lamp can not supply enough power to the new 9 watt bulb to get it to work consistently. I saw the poor reviews on the replacement bulbs and ignored them because these bulbs were the only replacement bulbs available. Now, not only do I have to replace a lamp because the bulb burnt out- but I am out the money for the replacement bulbs too. I was lucky, my bulb lasted almost a year. Some people have bulbs that only last a few weeks. Good luck if you buy this. I would strongly recommend another product. In fact, I am searching for another brand of lamp right now. Myself, I will be paying more attention to these reviews."
2,Timer doesn't work,"I took a chance even after I read a review that said the timer didn't work on theirs either. The light stays on all the time. I think I have really just bought a glorified fluorescent light. I have only had it for one day, but my carnivorous plant seems to have responded. The adapter that plugs into the wall gets pretty hot. I am thinking I should have gotten one of the clip lights that cost $8-12 instead. I don't think its worth the $42 bucks. Maybe half that."
4,Works pretty well!,"My only real complaint about the one I have is that they put the watering and season LED lights on the back where you cannot see them. The season is not a problem, but the watering light should be somewhere more visible."
1,Don't think it's working,"I don't think the water indicator works; if taken out of the soil the ""needs water"" light comes on but when I leave it in the soil it NEVER comes on. I planted seeds and left them under the light for a month and got nothing. I'd return it but my 30 days are up. Amazon, can I still return this?"
2,Disappointing,I loved this product and I received it as a Christmas present. I would have rated it a 5. However I would have gone back and changed my rating because it is less than a year later and it is bot working! This is why I am rating this product as a 2. My mom paid nearly $40 dollars for this and less than a year later it is broken. It was great while it worked. But it's life span is disappointing!
3,Bulb dies after less than 6 month,"I purchased two of these plant growers. However, the bulbs of both died less than 6 month. I thought the bulb life should be 10,000 hours. What a disappointment! I searched for the replacement bulb and found it cost around $20 after shipping and handling. Way too much for a simple bulb. After doing some research, I found the Osram Dulux S/E 9W 600 lm (connector type 2G7) to be a perfect replacement. It costs only about $4 each. I hope this is useful to others."
1,HORRIBLE,"I just received the item. Within 45 seconds, it stoppped working and almost went on fire. It started smoking and smelled terrible. Do not buy this item, unless you want your house to burn down."
2,Doesn't work after changing the bulb twice,"I have replaced the florescent bulb twice after the original one quit working. I believe that the bulbs would work if the device that charges the florescent worked, but the light just flickers without turning on fully. I've now spent money twice to fix a problem that remains unresolved. So, the plant light worked great until the bulb went out. Then you might as well purchase a new light, otherwise good luck trying to get it fixed."
1,Not durable,"My wife and I are avid orchid growers, and find the 9W lamp perfect for displaying low-light plants (such as phalenopsis) that are in bloom. The colors are pleasant, and the plants seem to do well. We do not use the watering probes as we have our own watering schedules for the various plants, so I can't rate how well they work.We have owned six of these lights over the last five years, and all six have had their timers either fail to switch the light on, or fail to switch the light off. We also had an out-of-box failure that Amazon exchanged immediately. They last no more than about two years. I'm currently sitting with three dead PL-1 lamps next to me, and came here while searching the web looking for instructions on how to ""hot wire"" the circuit board so the bulb will just stay on. That way I could keep using them with a $4.95 mechanical timer.If they just had a bulb and a switch, they'd be perfect. Unfortunately, the ""intelligent"" electronics die quickly."
5,Cat Memorial,I recently ordered this cat memorial when two of my cats died within a week of each other. I plan to use it as a marker on their graves once I get the area looking the way I want it. The item arrived very quickly and is nice as it shows in the photo. There is a hanger on the back if someone should decide to hang it instead of laying it on the ground. I would definitely recommend this item to someone looking for a tasteful and reasonably priced memorial for their cat(s).
4,Future Care of Your Disabled Child,"""This book addresses a variety of issues related to planning for a child with a disability, including special needs trusts, guardianships, government benefits programs, and taxes. It focuses on the importance of developing a comprehensive life plan for the child and is written on a level that is fairly easy to understand. Because this book was published in 1995, information gathered from it may need to be updated according to more recent changes in the law.""I deducted one star for the publication date (1995), but the overall info is invaluable for someone facing this situation."
5,YuYu Hakusho The Dark Tournament Saga Part II,"I've started watching YuYu Hakusho on Cartoon Network. I missed a few episodes, so I picked up YuYu Hakusho The Dark Tournament Saga Part II. The box set contains special features and extras. There are 20 episodes on 6 DVDs. If you want to know the episode titles I have included them in this review.Disc .14-No Return47.Legendary Bandit: Yoko Kurama48.The Cape Of No Return49.Genkai's Strength50.Suzuka's ChallengeDisc .15-Settle The Score51.Arch-Rivals52.The Death Of Genkai53.Overcoming GriefDisc .16-Yoko Kurama54.The Beginning Of The End55.The Beast Within56.Yoko's MagicDisc .17-Sword And Dragon57.Beneath Bui's Armor58.Wielder Of The Dragon59.The Shadow Of The Elder ToguroDisc .18-Deadly Toguro60.Sakyo's Power61.Yusuke VS.

2,poor selection,"the only adult song on this cd is the Master at Work mix ofDonna Summer's ""I Feel Love"", they did a great job & this mix is difficult to find on cd. The rest of the songs are to cheesy for words!!."
4,A linguistics text book,"The material in the book is nicely organized and clearly explained. It is an exposition of the language, instead of a ""learn a few phrases quickly"" text book. If you are going there next week, and you need to ask for the bathroom in Nepali, this is not for you. If you go there next year, and you like an academic style, you may like it.Not five stars because of the many typographical problems which arose from the conversion to a digital copy. Sometimes the characters lack important features which make them look strange to someone who's just started learning how to read devanagari.I also contacted the publisher to inquire about the promised audio material (as instructed in the preface), and they said it's out of print."
4,alton ellis- arise blackman,"AN EXCELLENT CD, COVERING 10 YEARS OF ALTON AT HIS BEST.The album contains some long lost treasures in reggae, such as RASTA SPIRIT.And for anyone not familiar with Sir ALTON, this cd is a great introduction."
4,great resource,"A great resource for any Spanish, translation or interpretation student to help increase one's vocabulary."
3,Quick but slightly finicky set-up for straight routing jobs.,"I've been using the 36"" Clamp-N-Tool the last three years for straight routing jobs --be it laying a groove on, or straightening off the ends of, a panel.Advantages:1. Quick set-up (and dismantling). Before I got this tool, I had to make my own wooden straightedge on the jointer and then clamp it down using C-clamps. I also need to regularly check that my wooden straightedge had not warped or bowed.Disadavantages:2. Suppose you want to make a rectangular tabletop by routing the edges straight and square. When you tighten down the clamp, the straightedge is not automatically perpendicular to the clamping surfaces. You still need to manually check the straightedge's position to ensure that the resulting corners will be square.2. At least on my particular Clamp-N-Tool, the same end (the one with the floating clamp thingy) would consistently shift about 1/8"" everytime I tighten the clamp. Might just be a defect with my particular Clamp-N-Tool."
4,Fast and Easy,"Ingenious design makes temporary fencing fast and easy.Drawbacks:Guide can slip sideways while engaging lever.Unclamping snap can hurt fingers.Design and build tolerances don't not allow for ultimate accuracy. The fixed lever end does securely locate the guide, however, the sliding stop end will move 1-2mm. This play cannot be prevented by simply increasing the clamping force. It is caused by slop between the sliding plastic end stop and the aluminum bar.ConclusionGood enough for many carpentry jobs, but not acceptable for fine furniture construction."
4,Clamp to end all clamps!,"I bought two of the 36"" models last year and are they handy! I have used these for routing and planning many a board without a problem. I found that just one was not enough and you may too."
4,POPS508320@AOL.COM,"THIS IS TO THE MFG. IF YOU LOWERED YOUR PRICE I am quite sure you wood sell many more of this item. (JUST FOOD FOR THOUGHT)Maybe I was a little to ruff on my last review. I would give it a 3 1/2 stars, the balance is because of the high price. AND AS I STATED ABOVE.I'M SURE YOU WOULD SELL MORE OF THAT ITEM IF THE PRICE was better."
5,wedding Garter,"my garters arrived as promised and they are very beatiful. they are the perfect color and they fit great.i would recommend ,Hortense B. Hewitt to other customers, because they have great products at great prices!!!!"
3,Dodgy drivers,The card does it's job - when it works. About 1/5 boots the system goes to safe mode and XP identifies the problem as the driver. I'm running the latest drivers for my AGP slot from Asus and the latest MS certified drivers from MS Windows updater. My power supply is 400W so more than capable of dealing with this. If they made the drivers as solidly as the card it would be a good buy. I fear I may have to return it before my 30 days is up.
2,Far too basic,"I bought this book to help prepare me for the A+ exam. As a computer enthusiast, I was already familiar with most of the concepts which that exam covers, but wanted a refresher and something geared specifically for it. I was very disappointed.This book is overly basic; I have known everything in it for years. It does not at all reflect the relative depth of the A+ exam. If this is your only preparation for that exam, you will fail miserably. Only the bare fundamentals of hardware and OS's are discussed. Basic things are repeated ad naseum.If you have never looked inside your PC or read anything about PCs before, you might like the super-beginner level of this book - it will familiarize you with basic PC terms like ""CPU"" and ""PCI."" If you're at all serious about PCs and/or the A+ exam, look somewhere else."
5,easy to install,The product works as it should. I used it for a blowthrough on my truck and works great. It seals all the weather out
1,Another Dismal Effort From Whiting,"Charles Whiting is the hack writer of WWII churning out books on an assembly line basis, with little research to back up his cliched comments. This is another in a long line of dismal efforts. He's more interested in inserting meaningless anecdotes, often crude, than presenting anything new or substantive. More factual information on Hitler's West Wall can be obtained from countless better sources including a good WWII encyclopedia, such as the Oxford Companion to WWII. Don't waste your money on this or any of his other drivel."
1,West Wall The Battle for Hitler's Siegfried Line,From my experience as an infantryman with the 84th Infantry Division in WW2 I feel much of the book is fiction. His discussion of the action around Geilenkirchen in November - December 1944 is void of the actual time line. Dates in general are inored in the book. The author has no feeling of what WW2 combat was. So far my search to find biographic information on the author has not turned up much. He has written a lot of books.
3,A delightfully written book.,"Amazingly for such a major series of battles, their has been very little written about Hitler's Western Wall.The writer of this book has tried to seal this gap. Unfortunately it does need better. The writer has a habit of writing sweeping statements eg if the allies had not broken the wall, Nazi Germany would have survived. I doubt it, all that would have happened assuming the Allies were held is that the Soviets would have grabbed more of Germany in the East and the Allied advance up in Italy would have been more important too.Still however it is a well written book. It certainly not boring. I suspect that the writer does know a lot about his subject and the military. Reads like an adventure story. Full of interesting facts. Well worth a read."
2,So what was the Siegfried Line,"I have ups and downs with this book. THe account of combat might be the strong point, but he certainly does not make clear what this vaunted Siegfried Line actually was. The book lacks an adequate description of ""Hitler's Siegfried Line""."
1,Inaccurate readings,My child was sick with a fever I used this thermometer because it quickly gave a reading. But when she did not feel the least bit warm and it showed her temp over 101. I checked it again and it said 99. I am needing a thermometer to be accurate and consistent! This product does not meet my standards.
1,"Easy to use, but not reliable","We received this thermometer as a baby shower gift. For a few months it worked very well...easy to use. After about 8 months it started acting strange, giving us inaccurate readings. The final straw was when the thermometer read 104.8 degrees sending us to the ER at midnight only to find out our son's temperature wasn't even over 100. The thermometer ended up in the trash can on our way out of the hospital."
2,I keep inadvertently switching to Celsius,"When everything was working just right, this thermometer was great. It would detect my baby's temperature quickly, and also flash red if there was a fever. However, it all too easily switched from Fahrenheit to Celsius and it would take me forever to switch it back...or I'd find myself relying on grade school math to convert the number to Fahrenheit. Sometimes just sliding it out of the protective case would switch from F to C. I wish it had been more user friendly. I am looking to purchase a different one now and would recommend prospective buyers look elsewhere."
1,would not turn on out of the box,The thermometer I purchased would not turn on right out of the box. Thankfully Amazon will let you return baby items with free postage. I am sending back but I had to go to a retail store and buy another thermometer during the recent bad weather that swept the country.
5,Technologies of Freedom - you have to read this!,This is an extraordinary analysis of the contemporary media world and of all forces whose are influencing media. Written in 1983 it is still actual and fresh point of view on the regulatory processes and political control over media and technology.
3,Serviceable,"It would seem that there is money to be made out there somewhere for a mid-priced laundry sink that falls somewhere between basic el cheapo and restaurant quality stainless steel. This sink falls into the former category, and, while the price is right, and it hasn't collapsed during use, I do get a little nervous every time the washer drains. Still, for the price, I will not complain much other than to say that I suspect that it will not be very long before the surface is permanently stained (but, hey, it's in the basement, right?). Drab, a little flimsy looking, but so far so good."
4,Great sink... if,"The legs are very lightly made, the sink is top flight. I simply made my own stand. The legs it comes with are probably OK --I haven't read a review where they failed (yet, anyway). This is a good value without the legs --I'd have given it 5 stars if it had been offered without legs at an only slightly lower price. I am pleased with this sink, but then I also made my own stand --which may not be an option for everyone."
4,laundry tub,"The tub is fine, the legs are horrible. I had to make my own so that the tub was not able to tip over."
3,The Pump tube or Spray,"My husband just want to surprise me (and he did) sending me this but I NEED to complain about the pump tube!!! it throws the cologne not ""spray"" it!!! it is very annoing and I just got it!! so it's NEW!!!I had this perfume before (well, not from Amazon) and I never knew it could happen, it is more like a water gun then a perfume spray... how can I ask for another spray (pump tube) or send it back... Amazon says is harzadous and non-returnable!!!"
1,Different or fake?,"I got this directly from amazon.com at the end of March, and then it turned out that this is different from what I used to use.It does not smell the same, and it smells nothing on clothes.I believe the item is fake.Moreover, even though it says it says 6.8 ounce, I got 6.7 ounce.Since the item is not longer produced, there must be many counterfeits.Even amazon has some of them.So be careful when you buy."
2,NOT THAT GOOD,I think this CK Be Toilette Spray is fake. I believe it smells differently from the once displayed at retail sales stores.Really fast delivery. That was next day at my place.
3,nice smell but scent would not last long,"it has a nice smell but the scent would not last that long , you have to spray again and again if you want a long duration of the scent"
1,Wrong size do not buy from NetRush,"This is complete BS. The title shows 6.7 oz EDT CK Be, but what you get in the mail is 3.4 oz. It gets worse, when you call them, they say, ""oops the description says 1.7 oz"" So there is nothing they can do except for return it with a restocking fee. Something really shady is going on, because excuse me, 1.7 oz of this cologne NEVER retailed for $85 like the description says. SCAMMERS. I will only purchase directly from Amazon in the future. Oh, and the bottle was leaky when it arrived, and there was no invoice or return slips inside. They KNOW THEY ARE SCAMMING PEOPLE. :("
2,Maybe try something else,I can never tell if anyone can smell this cologne when I put it on. When I wear ck1 people compliment me and say I smell nice. This one I can't tell if it smells bad or just doesn't smell at all.
1,Bad experience,"Don't know what happened with this product. I normally wear CK Be and I love it so much. However, I just opened this one and use it. Apparently, there is no scent. I tried to spray a lot, but it liked I sprayed water on my body. So disappointed!!!"
3,Smells Great While It Lasts,"CK Be does smell fantastic... unfortunately, the scent vanishes in no time at all, even after an ample (or even excessive) amount is used."
4,Love this smell,I bought the CK1 and the CKb and this one is the best by far. It is a refreshing kind of smell that doesn't make want to back away from hubs when he gets too close. A total difference from the CK1. This was his perfect X-mas present and I will keep buying this one. Very happy I got it and I sometimes wear it myself. It a unisex smell that isn't either a prominent female or male fragrance.
1,Horrible,"The bottles arrived and smelled nothing like CKbe, I feel cheated. I've ordered it before and everything was great. Not sure what happened this time"
3,Playin Games,"Ever thought you wouldn't find that one you love because of all of the judgmental things you placed ahead of yourself well Niqui Stanhope shows you how to laid down the rules ahead of time to make the judging easier when it comes to picking the crème of the crop.Marcel Templeton took a look at her life and knew that all good things would come to her in time.

3,THE RULES,"Marcel Templeton takes a look at her life and knew that all good things would come to her in time. When her boyfriend calls her on her 30th birthday , she thought nothing but good things, but when Alex breaks Marcel's heart she declares nothing and nobody will do it again. Ian Michaels is a single , thirty six years old and is raising his niece alone when he meets Marcel . He's intrigued at what he finds and he's determined to win her over at all cost.Marcel has her own set of rules but Ian goes in to then relationship intent on winning her over. A few things will hurt him before she is won over, but with her determined loved ones there to help , nothing can be put past them. Take a quick look at Changing the Rules and you will see how a couple of rules can land you the best out there. The book was a quick yet witty read. Mrs. Stanhope holds your attention into the very end."
5,GREAT DEAL,I wasn't sure about this product but read the review and thought lets try it. I love it. My husband and I are in it every night before bed. Easy set up and easy to care for. Well worth the price.
4,A useful textbook,"The New Critical Idiom series make for great companions to courses. Sanders' Adaptation and Appropriation is a compact, clear, usable textbook that cuts through the muddy water of critical debates on exactly what those two terms (and a host of other related terms) mean."
1,Too Bad ...,I've high hopes for this brand but unfortunately did not deliver. I used to use Cutting Gel and really worked wonders for me. Only thing I didnt like about it was the odor. I saw reviews about Dermazide that it is much better than Cutting Gel and without that odor issue. I tried using it for a month and didnt see any results. I wanted to return it but didnt have time to find out how to do that.
1,Waste of paper and ink,"An abject waste of paper and ink - much less the time and energy of those involved in its creation. A patched together storyline that's patched together very badly, to the extent that the art is not enough to save it. A product not worthy of the collective talent of those involved in its creation and talent. Certainly does not live up to the standards of the franchise that spawned the character."
4,Great development.,"I am very happy of having gotten this flash.. it works pretty well, and I like its performance."
3,not bad,"Not too bad. Needed this for a job and I was surprised at how fast it got here. Still had to go out and stock it with a few things; more band-aids, sports wraps, ect. Only problem was the BP cuff not being calibrated correctly..."
4,Pretty Good,"The one I received is not exactly like the photo, but close enough for what I wanted. Supplies are in good quantity for a basic kit, but I have loaded up on a lot of the other essentials. Looks durable and price is reasonable for all you get."
3,"Good product, NOT Fully Stocked.","I purchased the item and, while it says ""fully stocked"", it's nowhere near as stocked as would be required for an EMS or trauma bag, and definitely nowhere near as stocked as the photos of the product.It came with a significant amount of bandaging (almost all gauze) and a few tools: BP cuff, stethoscope, banded and non-banded shears, but definitely needs a fair bit more dollar investment to pack it for a proper EMS or trauma bag. This is NOT to be considered ""fully stocked""."
1,First Resonder Kit Fails Test,"This is a very disapointing First Responder Kit. It is smaller than what is presented and half of the bag is taken up by a Blodd Pressure Tester in a box. I work around Paramedics and this kit is a joke. Do not purchase. Also, the company will stick you with the return postage after you find out what a waste this kit is."
4,Useful STARTER bag,"A great bag, me bing an EMT and Wife is a nurse, we use this bag when out on homeless ministry, or working at camps. Has a lot of things you may need one day but lacks basic first aid material (antibiotic ointment, bandaids, etc) wonderful if you are in an environment that you can restock rapidly (ambulance, trainer, etc), but for field work, take a good look at what you need and stock it your self. Hardy bag, takes a beating and the price rocks for all we got. Missing star is from me not looking closer at what I bought, I got EXACTLY what was offered."
2,MISLEADING,"Overall this is a great product, however the description lists MANY items that are not actually included in the bag. As it turns out the list that I saw was a product review, citing all the extra items the customer had added to make it complete. Also the blood pressure cuff, nor the stethascope work. I'm not sure if I deal with the manufacturer or Amazon?"
3,A good start,"The bag i received looks a little different, Its more of a red than orange, and with a blue Star or Life, which is okay with me, the one i got does not have removable velcro pockets... but im not going to send it back, It came stocked with lots of goods, the Stethoscope is on the very cheap side.. i guess you could say the same for the BP cuff. but its a 100$ kit, Deff need to add more to the kit, but its a good start."
4,Good Starter Kit,"We bought this Trauma Bag as we needed something ""more"" than your basic first aid kit and this definately got us started. While it does come with some supplies i.e. stethascope and trauma pads, I made a list of items such as hydrogen peroxide, saline, triple antibiotic, burn cream, ect. that would best suit our needs while the velcro ""walls"" inside the kit make sure everthing has a nice snug fit without fear of items moving around. The water proof bottom is an added bonus as we will be keeping this out in our cabin on an acerage as it will be used in all sorts of weather. This bag is not intended for everyday use but definately worth the price."
5,Good deal,Overall a great product and great value. Had to add a few extra things to make it a more versitile trauma kit no biggy for basic users.
5,Great for in car first aid kit.,I bought this kit after completing my first aid training. It is more comprehensive than any first aid kit that you will find in drugstores. I used it a number of times when volunteering at school activities.
5,Awesome,I am a chief of an emergency squad and had been looking to do a ems jump bag for a member. This bag had all the essentials needed and was amazingly priced. The bag was sturdy and had lots of room. The company was absolutely GREAT to work with. I will definitely be doing more business with this company.
3,Larger than I expected,"The bag itself is freaking huge. Kind of empty-ish, plenty of room to add more items to this ""Fully Stocked"" kit I guess. I'm not overly impressed but not bad for the price."
4,Trauma Bag,The bag is really well made. I am going to add to the products inside. The bag is bright and sturdy. I recommend it but you will likely want to add to the first aid supplies inside.I would however recommend it for quick access.
2,Decent but doesnt cut it,"Though there are many items in the bag, it is geared more towards first aid instead of Trauma. The bag is very low quality and the price is a bit to high. You could have made this kit for half the products. This bag gives your convenience but not worth the price."
3,"Perfect for the home, so-so for the field.","Its pretty well stocked with band-aids as nd gauze. I had to add quick clot, a biological resperator, eye protection, and a burp vent for lung punctures to make it acceptable for law enforcement use."
3,Fine...but not if it's refurbished,"The battery is fine. However, the only one listed here is refurbished. Lithium-ion batteries lose their capacity as they age (that's why I want a new one in the first place); and the idea of refurbishing lithium-ion batteries is...dubious at best. Some people claim it can't be done; others say it can; still others claim that it just means they took the battery out of a unit that was returned, tested it, and decided it was OK. The seller here, IT Equipment Express, did not respond when I asked what kind of testing had been done.So instead I contacted Dynamism, a company that imports gadgets from Japan (they used to sell the Zaurus 6000, for example). It wasn't on their Website, but they were able to find me a new one in Japan and ship it over. Plus, they charged me significantly less than IT Equipment Express was asking."
3,bgdglvr23,"I bought this music and knew nothing about the band, I like it but don't listen to it often. Music is cheery and upbeat, songs are relatively the same. Maybe I'm just too old for this type of music."
2,"not that good, actually","Don't listen to all these rave reviews. This is not great pop music by any stretch of the imagination. Dream All Day is good, but then you probably knew that back in 1993. Nothing else on the album approaches the strength of that one song. The tracks on FOTB are okay as background music, but there is nothing that amazes you in terms of melody, lyrics, or creativity. If you want to listen to an under-appreciated 90s artist, pick upIn Reverseby Matthew Sweet. Now that's some vastly underrated pop music right there. FOTB is average pop music for people without much of a sense of what great pop music is, but want to feel like they're cool because they like a band from Seattle that has been ""criminally ignored"" by people who actually like to listen to something worth their time. Don't buy the hype."
4,What Can You Say?,"I'm not going to do anything but throw my voice in with the chorus. Brass ring indie rock. If you miss the days of smart propulsive music this is where to go.Tight harmonies, intriguing lyrics, jagged melodies, and full-on band interaction. A masterful malange of 60s, 70s, and 80s guitar rock mixed and matched with no concern for the namecheck.My only regret is I waited so long to buy this. Get this ahead of the revival curve where in 2010 everyone admits that they liked this on VH-1.Another piece to support my theory that guitar rock was perfected in the early nineties."
2,Poor quality. Both of mine have broken with minimal usage,Both of the ones I bought have broken; one immediately and one after a short period (a few weeks). In both cases one of the plastic posts that was joined at a right angle to another post sheared off irreparably. I'll have to try to make my own out of something sturdier.
2,"Great idea, poor quality","As another review mentioned, these break easily. I have owned 3 now, and all three have broken after several weeks' usage. Functionally, it works great, is lightweight, and makes it so easy to carry hangers around the house, and keeps them untangled. I have some wire hangers that have a tighter fit, but the plastic tubular hangers, as pictured with the product, fit very easily on the holder.I am going to buy a wire holder elsewhere on Amazon; hopefully that will work better, and then I'll throw these plastic things out. As another reviewer said, they are not repairable. If I was handy, I'd try to make myself one instead."
1,Horrible quality,"As they say- you get what you pay for. My bad for expecting a cheap item to be actually functional and of decent quality. The product is terrible- flimsy, rickety and very cheap looking. It fits only plastic hangers properly and although the label said would also fit wooden hangers, it did not fit any of the wooden hangers I have. I returned it back to the Container Store. Sometimes an inexpensive product is just that- cheap and horrid vs. being a decent product at a bargain price."
1,Flimsy! Should be made of metal.,"This item is perfect for what we want to do: neatly collect empty hangers from the closet and carry them to the laundry room for reuse.But other reviewers are right, it breaks quickly, even with careful use.If it were made of metal, or a less fragile design, we'd give it FIVE stars.As is: JUNK."
2,Disappointed,"I knew when I ordered this rack that it couldn't be much for as little as it cost. It was far less than I expected though. Very small, and poorly made. It wouldnt even stay together. I had to use plastic glue on it before I could even use it. It is very useful, but I don't expect it will last very long. If it were made of metal, and was a little bigger, it would be awesome."
2,broke,This item was broke when I received it. A little glue and I was able to make it work. wasnt worth sending back for a replacement and waiting 2 weeks. Otherwise after being fixed does what its supposed to
4,Does the trick,This product does exactly what it is suppose to do. My closet is way less cluttered now that I can neatly stack hangers on the holder. It is easy to carry around the house. I've had it for more than a month and it still works great--hasn't broken. I recommend it to anyone!
1,Poor quality,the upright pegs keep breaking off. Kids hangers do not really fit well. expect that if i keep forcing them in and out that it would only lead to the pegs breaking more.
5,no more mess,"Simple, inexpensive, easy to assemble in seconds. Hangers in one neat place and you can carry this holder around. Thanks!"
3,plastic hanger holder,"It turned out that this holder only holds one style of hanger, of which I have a few, but I would love a holder that would hold other styles."
2,Keep Looking,"I ordered three of these. I did read the other bad reviews before ordering but since I could not find anything like these for a reasonable price , I decided to order any way. They are just as other reviewers stated, very flimsy Think I would have been better off spending 3 to 4 times as much and just getting one."
5,The greatest story ever told/,"EVEL-WAYS..this book rocks with great pictures an storys of the greatest daredevil to ever walk the earth,,,if your a knievel fan it's a no brainer,if your a fan of the daring it's for you too,,,the book takes you on the wild ride that was EVEL KNIEVEL's life,not only as the world famous motorcycle daredevil,but through out his life,,Loaded with great KNIEVEL qoutes an tons of rare never before seen pictures from EVEL's own collection,,hey there's even one of ME BOB COOK an my son Bobby which is just too cool...i give this book two thumbs up,,,more if i had more then two thumbs...BUY THIS BOOK,,,"
4,90 minutes of great entertaining!,"When I watched the movie for the first time I didn't know what to say about it.But when I watched it several times I started to love it. The first room(includes Madonna)was boring. But the other rooms where great.I really enjoyed Tim Roth as the bellboy with the big mouth,Antonio Banderas as a crazy Mexican father and offcourse the master him self: Mr. Quintin Tarantino.Lets drink a glass of cristal on that!"
4,Bete-noir at its best,"The subtleties within the series of vignettes contained in this picture will be lost on the narrow-minded. The double-entendres and self-mocking performances of the cast are delightful and, given the egotistical natures of many of its ""stars"", are surprisingly funny rather than overbearing. If one enjoys ""black comedy - a la 'The War of the Roses'"", one will get a kick out of this flick. I laughed til I cried."
1,dv that doesnt work,the dvd didn't work and returning it couldn't be more awkward so just cut my losses not happy in the slightest
1,QT IS A DRAG,"It's sad, but if you look at it, Tarentino was a big spike of hype because NOTHING ELSE was happening. This guy made a career by ripping off and disecting finer films and he still sucks. THE WORST, being his own, ugly cameo roles, which slow movies to absolute halts. His sickening, saddening ego must be vanquished, so that actual, cool and less pathetically juvenile films can be made again. Good hair implants though, DUDE."
4,Hilarious!!,"I think this is Tim Roth's best performance in a film to date. Ted the Bellboy goes from wacky situation to wacky situation, and gets funnier every time! (I've got problems - plural!) The movie gets funnier as it goes along, and Antonio Banderas also gives his funniest performance in this film as a [angry] dad determined to do New Year's Eve right, leaving his horrible children in Ted the Bellboy's care. If you like quirky, sometimes dark humor, this is definitely a movie for you!"
2,A SURPRISING DISAPPOINTMENT,"Lawrence Benders' surreal comedy is split into four sequences, linked by bell boy, Tim Roth as he goes through each room, dealing with off the wall customers. Its all a bit of a hit and miss affair. Ambitious and seemingly desperate to plumb new depths, it often fails with many scenees falling flat. This is all the more surprising when it has such an impressive and talented cast which includes Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Quentin Tarentino, David Proval and Amanda De Cadanet. The whole thing holds a few laughs along the way but on the whole its only very moderatley enjoyable. See it only if curiosity gets the better of you."
2,A Low Blow from Tarantino,"Being a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino I decided to rent Four Rooms the other night. Little did I realize, I would be wasting a good hour and a half of my life. I knew right away it was not going to be half as good as his other work, but my main expectation was to see my favorite actress, Marisa Tomei, in the film. I kinda figured she would be in the movie a bit longer since she was placed on the cover in a blonde wig, but that was just a ""low blow from Tarantino"". Marisa shows up for a grand three minutes. You can't fully blame Tarantino for this movie, because 3 other directors helped him to make this movie. Basically I was expecting much more, but I realized it was just a series of one-acts and should only be appreciated as that. The acting is good, but its just simply bizarre, and leaves you wanting more (Marisa Tomei)"
2,"One room only, please","I bought this film specifically for the Robert Rodriguez segment. For me it was the only amusing one. The music by Esquivel was too busy, intrusive and tiresome. I'v begun to hate ""clever"" animated opening credits...unless they are truly clever. Tim Roth can blaze in the right role. In this film he enters the ham zone."
3,"So-So, So Watch It!","I have only watched it once, maybe I should see it again to be fair. But I kept waiting for something to tie everything together, but with the exception of Roth and one actress who appears in more than one segment, these are stand-alone pieces. The first one was just stupid and really had no pay-off (there should have been some kind of ironic twist on this one - be careful what you wish for!). The second one was mildly entertaining. THE THIRD ONE WAS EXCELENT with the two kids stealing the entire movie! QTs segment was OK as it built a nice tension that was missing from the rest of the movie. If nothing else, rent it for the third story!"
5,Amazingly Funny!,"This is a great film. Critics that rip this one apart either went in with unreasonable expectations, had the actors typecasted, or they're just plain blind. Every detail is geared to amuse...from Ted's swagger and smug demeanor that slips into unbridled rage and eventually comes very close to the edge of insanity, to the strange yet alluring peeks into the lives of many odd characters, this film has it all. Don't go into it with any expectations whatsoever -- as with life, that's bound to leave you disapointed. Just let go and enjoy -- you'll not be able to remember when the last time was that you laughed so hard."
1,can you say DUD?,"Okay, the only reason I have one star is because Amazon wouldn't let me have less! This trashy, quickie film seems so slapped together and an otherwise excellent cast is left standing around, wincing and praying for script approval next time. But, wait, WAS there a script? We get Antonio Banderas, Madonna, Tim Roth, and Kathy Griffen standing around and saying lines that they seem to saying for the first time ever. This film is just embarrasing."
1,"Yeah, this one's a real ""indie""....*sarcasm*","This pathetic excuse for a movie is not an independent film. Only an unexperienced and incredibly stupid moviegoer would mistake for an independent production. It's released by Miramax, who have become a major studio, and that's the only even slighlty indie thing about. At an hour and a half, it's still a stupid bloated mess. The third segment is worth watching for the puke, but Rodriguez' fast approach to filmmaking has never seemed more whorish. The fourth is worthwhile because of Tarantion's occasionally funny script, but even the great QT couldn't keep this mess afloat. Alison Anders and Alexandre Rockwell completely screwed themselves with their terrible segments. While QT and Rodriguez came out of this cinematic Vietnam somewhat unscathed, Anders and Rockwell never recovered. Utter shit."
3,Offbeat comedy with 4 directors - mixed results,"This film has Tim Roth as a novice Bellboy getting caught up in the absurd goings on at 4 different hotel rooms, with each sequence having a different director. Quentin Tarantino acts in and directs the last sequence, which is really the least amusing. Overall the acting is good, with many small roles by actors/actresses such as Madonna, Jennifer Beals, Lili Taylor, Ione Skye, Bruce Willis, Marisa Tomei, Kathy Griffin, and Antonio Banderas. The best part is directed by Robert Rodriguez, and has Banderas as the father of two kids who are involved in comic adventures (this also foreshadows Rodriguez's development of the Spy Kids films). There are no extras on the DVD and the first sequence with the wiccans is a bit creepy in retrospect since they are involved in Diana goddess worship in a film made before Princess Di was killed. Of course, the last sequence is pretty dark for a comedy, so this film is really a mixed bag."
5,Four rooms,"I own this movie and it one of the funniest movies i have. Tim Roth gives a perfect overexaggerated performance. Awesome cast, great directors."
4,"Weird, but good!",Great movie! Funny (in a really odd way) and fun to watch. If you have never seen it- you should!
3,"It&#65533;s just whacked, I love it.","Hrmm. Many people will find this movie to be boring and pointless. However, I watch it time and time again and laugh every time. Unlike most comedies this movie has actors that can act without being stupid. A good change in pace from any other movie you have ever seen. It's just whacked, I love it."
3,Three Rooms Too Many,"These anthology movies with multiple directors are usually a dicy proposition, ""New York Stories"" with Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Woody Allen helming each segment comes to mind. ""Four Rooms"" is no exception to this axiom. I won't waste a lot of time so I'll nutshell it. Allison Anders' piece is abysmal. How could it not be? Madonna's in it. Alexandre Rockwell's is little better but, then, how could it not be? The best is Robert Roriguez's segment. How could it not be? Antonio Banderas is in it. Quentin Tarantino seems to be phoning in it. He essentially uses this as an opportunity to drink and yuk it up with his buddies, namely an unbilled Bruce Willis. The verdict is see this for Rodriguez's piece and you might find some minor interest in maybe two of the others."
4,Quirky and fun!,"This movie was an unexpected find....quirky and fun....not for kids, but adults will find it amusing and worth the watch. There are some big names here in this movie and their performances will delight!"
4,Dumbest but funniest...,"I was up late on night and this was the only movie on. As I started watching it I thought it was the dumbest movie I ever saw. But, As he moved on to the 3rd room I almost peeed my pants (LOL). It stayed the dumbest but, became most hillarious movie I ever saw. Tim Roth truely made this movie. MaDonna on the other hand.. well, see for yourself."
4,cult classic,"If you are a Tarrintino fan you must buy this movie. It features four different stories, all with different directors. Must have for any cult classic fans."
3,Four Rooms w/more than a View,I ran across this on HBO one nite and found it strikingly hilarious and so off the wall. Had to own it for myself. Watch it - you'll agree it's a funny thinker kind of movie!
5,very funny,I've seen this movie before and couldn't find it in stores. I ordered it and got it within four days.
4,Three rooms out of four very entertaining,"This movie is divided into four rooms each with it's own directors and actors for the segment. The first room was a little over the top with the actress's playing witches. The second room mistaking identity was so funny I almost bust a gut a number of times as I watched the short. The third room was the misbehavors which was very funny movie short with Banderas and Directed by Robert Rodriguez, the kids made the bellhop's life very hard. The last room was by Tarantino and as you watch it you dont know if they will go threw with the bet but in the end they do the bet and the bellhop gets a very big tip for helping them go threw with the bet. All comedy fans must see this movie least once during their lifetime because you might not like all the rooms but you will enjoy most of them just like I did."
5,"I was sceptical at first...but when i got it, it was great!","Right when i got my nightvision device it was at 9:00 AM. I was mad, night time was a long ways away. So i went down into my basement. I closed the door and turned on my nightvision. There was a little bit of light coming threw the door cracks. I could see everything. And in the dark corners i would just push on the IR LED light (infrared light). I love this thing. I had a cyclops compact before, it was ok, it wasnt weather resistant. So i just went with the Exlorer. The Explorer has a rubberized case so if it where wet you would have a better grip, and it is more water resistant. I think whoever is deciding what kind of night vision they should get either the explorer or the 100% water proof ones. I like my night vision device alot."
3,good name of g1 night vision,"This night vision is one of the older generations of owlbut still work graet Compared with the new product of the same company or other ,the moncular The advantage of quality Piece, In terms of the ability of shocks,A clear vision of the limits of 100 m in total darknessand more than 350m in half moon light , the ir is Infrared is not the required level of rane and clearnot very light wight like new productbut work good ."
5,Pleasure in Using Our Gifts,"The Equipping Church is one of the best books I have ever read on what it means to use our God given gifts as members of the body of Christ. Sue Mallory doesn't sugar coat the time, effort and faith that is involved in building the kind of community many churches long for, but are unsure how to create. Ms. Mallory lays out the path her church followed in the process of moving toward and becoming a faithful place in which they could be God's people. The stories she shares are personal, sometimes heart wrenching, but always authentically filled with grace. Ms. Mallory makes me want to dig in and do the work to which I am called."
4,The best college dictionary at the moment,"This gets my vote for the best college dictionary at the moment. I say that partly because the competition has gotten so lazy over the years:1. American Heritage's dictionary crowds its pages so bad that you can barely read the text along the inner margins.2. Webster's floods the market with dictionaries with slightly different titles but none is distinguishable.3. Oxford & Longman equivalents: not enough words.The Encarta is easy to read, cleanly designed, and has features which are very helpful to the ESL student (usage points and common mispellings). There are a few historical inconsistencies as the other reviewer has noted, but the weak competition makes this still the best choice.Rosa"
5,Microsoft Encarta Dictionary,A great tool for my home schooled highschool age grandchildren. They love it and so do their parents.
4,Wonderful ayurveda book but just average cookbook.,"I was excited to get this book. Read it attentively and tried two of the recipies. Kitchari for Vata and Spicy Vegetable Fried Rice. The explaination by Vasant Lad was good and detail. I like it very much. As for the recipies, they smells superb but are tasteless. I still recomend this book for those who like to learn to cook a ayurvedic balanced food. But if you are looking into cooking a delicious mouth watering meal. This is not the book. Still an excellent ayurvedic book."
4,"Good, basic book","This is a good, very basic intro to Ayurvedic cooking, but if you're looking for a book that gives a clear and precise program for tackling real health problems through Ayurvedic principles of nutrition, I would strongly recommend the cookbook put out by Ayurvedic educator, Maya Tiwari's center in Asheville, NC, instead."
5,an excellent guidebook for healthy living,"This is a book by Vasant Lad and his wife. They give easy to follow guidelines on the best foods for your body type, along wtih great recipes. I have tried a few so far, and all are excellent. The explanations for each recipe are very detailed and informative, and accurately give the best types for the recipe.If you are a student of Yoga and/or Ayurveda, or just want to learn more about healthy, balanced Indian cooking, this is top notch source."
5,I love this book.,"Vasant Lad's explanations of ayurvedic cooking, accompanied by the elegant and tasty recipes created by his wife, Usha Lad, are on the top of my go to list when I wonder what's for dinner. I love this book."
4,An amazing light,"I have had this light about one year. The beam is a very focused, bright beam with no dark spots. The alleged usefull beam to 150' is optimistic, but aren't all similar manufacturer claims? The light is very well made, and for its size it produces an absolutely amazing amount of light. Drawbacks: the housing is very slick, and if your hands are wet or a little oily, you risk losing the light. I haven't dropped it, but it appears it would take a pretty good fall without a problem. Unless you drop it into the ocean or a lake cause it won't float. As for the battery expense....do a little surfing on the web and you can find the 123-lithium batteries for about $1.00 each if you are willing to purchase in bulk (20 or more). Take a look at the other Inova lights (the ""Bolt"" series) for cheaper but well-built alternatives which accept alkaline batteries (they don't produce as much light)."
4,really bright light for small size,"i had this light for 9 months already. i use it in the automotive field and lights up under the hood very well, even outside at night i can light up the top of a tree like day time. the only thing i dont like is that i use it constantly and i go through a pair of 123 battery's every month or so and these cost between $10-$13 for a pair. other than that its a very durable and bright."
4,excellent,I absolutely loved this book. I have read all of Ms. Cassidy's newer novels and am now reading her back list. This was one of my favorites. If you like a good romance and suspense this book is for you.
4,Challenging but energizing series,"This is not a tape for people new to Kundalini Yoga. However, once you have the basics down (such as breath of fire), it is a great fun series. As someone who just barely has the basics down, this is a yoga set that will remain challenging for sometime."
4,Sixth Grade Math text,"My son uses this book at schoool, it appears to be a decent introduction to many math subjects, and continues on the course 2 and so on. It is appealing in looks and examples. However, be very careful- in trying to lighten his backpack I went on-line to buy this. The paperback version is not this text at all- it is a workbook. That is why it is cheap. Somehow my son didn't want more problems to do...."
2,Not for self-study,I teach adult school math and was looking for something more concept based rather than rote/drill based and thought I'd try this book which is part of a 3-book middle school sequence. This is definitely a book that augments a teacher's lecture. It doesn't work as a standalone text.
1,Not what I expected,"I thought that 1200 thread count meant really soft.....while these sheets are really thick, they feel like sand paper. If you're looking for soft sheets, don't buy these."
1,Ouch,Agreed. I am about to pull them out of the dryer and they feel like cardboard. I have a feeling they are going in the trash.
5,Best one in this price range,I have used 3 competing brands for years. I never really liked using a tape gun until I got this one. The cutter stays sharp. The tape loads easily. Don't waste time with the other brands.
1,Unable to download pictures.,"I've tried to install the software at least 10 times...on two computers and two different operating systems...always the same result...pics won't download, if fact, I have to shut the computer down cause it freezes."
1,Don't waste your money,"In one year I had the camera replace three times by AGFA. Would of been more but it is about three-four month process for each and now my warranty is up. It stops working permanatly in 80 degree heat. It eats batteries like crazy. It extremely slow. It takes at least 10-15 secs between being able to take pictures. AGFA customer service is horrible. It's a Long distance call everytime. Make sure you have a half hour to wait on hold. I would not be surprised if I haven't paid the same amount in long distance as I did for the camera. I returned the third camera in Nov, they returned the camera in March and I still haven't gotten all the parts I need and it is now April. Last time I called was three weeks ago and today they said they have no new information on when my cables will be delivered. Don't make the mistake I did, spend a little more money, don't buy AGFA and you will save money in the long run."
3,"not bad, not great","It works as advertised...software is really neat and easy to work with. Inside pictures can be a little dark...Outside pictures are better. I'd suggest it be used only as a ""picures for email"" camera. You can use it live but you need a lot of light."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"I GOT ONE OF THESE CAMERAS BEFORE THANKSGIVING. I NEVER COULD USE IT. WHEN THEY PACKAGED THE DISCS FOR THE CAMERA THEY PUT TAPE OVER THEM TO HOLD THEM IN. THIS OF COURSE TOOK THE INFORMATION OFF THE DISC. I COULD NOT GET ANY COOPERATION FROM THE COMPANY DIRECTLY TO REPLACE THE DISC. AMAZON CALLED AND GOT ME THE INFORMATION I NEEDED TO HAVE THE DISC REPACED BY THE AGFA. AS OF TODAY, JAN 17TH, I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE DISC. FORTUNATELY, I HAVE ALREADY RETURNED THE CAMERA TO AMAZON. I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING ELSE WITHE THE AGFA NAME. THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR THE CUSTOMER WITH THIS COMPANY!!!!!"
3,little and slow,"The resolution on this camera isn't very good, and it takes a good 7 seconds to take the picture. So you have sit there forever."
1,BREAKS ALL THE TIME!!!!,"This is the worst camera I have ever had, digital *or* film. I asked for an nice entry level digital camera for Christmas last year and this is what I got. It has already broken TWICE and I have had to have it replaced. The first time it took forever for me to actually get ahold of customer service because they don't give you a number to call until you submit your info and go through all kinds of troubleshooting over the web. They sent me a new camera within 3 weeks and I sent the bad one back. Low and behold 3 months later the new one they sent me HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM!!!!! This time they have told me their process has changed and I have to send in the bad one first before they will send me a new one. The whole process will take about 6-8 weeks they have said. I'll almost be out of warranty by that time and it'll probably just break again....arg!!! You'd be better off buying a throw away camera....DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!"
2,Cheap Camera in Every sense of the word,"I bought this camera after reading two of the posted reviews and I must admit it has been a waste of money. To get one good photo I ended taking about thirty and still ended up doing quite a bit of editing to get it decent. For emailing stuff etc It's passable (once you can get the shot you want!!!) for printing, you'd end up just wasting your Photo paper! Do yourself a favour, invest the money and buy something a bit more expensive. The extra money you spend will more than outweigh the frustration with this item."
1,"Another ""Don't waste your money"" Vote","I bought this camera while shopping for a web cam, I decided to buy this camera because it would also ""Travel"". It quit taking pictures after 1 trip outdoors, it just makes little chirping sounds now when you push the buttons, this camera apparently doesn't like to go outside. I could get my money back or a replacement but don't want to bother. It still works ok as a web cam, I guess I'll just use it for that. The few times I did take still photo's the resolution is very poor and the colors were washed out badly. I shouldn't complain cause when I bought the cam I think it was mispriced at a national office supply chain, I bought it for less than half the price I've seen it for anywhere. I just look at it like I have a fairly good value in a web cam."
2,Poor image quality camera,"I didn't expect an excellent camera for this price, but just wanted to be able to take pictures and upload it to the Internet. It messes up colors, and you can't get a really close shot of your object. Also it takes too long to take a picture, I had to keep it still for at least 10 sec., so the pictures won't come out blurry. Overall I think this camera is not worth its price. I'd rather wait a few months and get a better quality camera."
1,No Better Than A Toy!,"Unfortuantly this camera is a real dud. I don't know where all the positive praise is coming from.The big problem is one must hold the camera absolutely still when taking a picture - and if the subject is moving at all, forget it!It is almost impossible to take a picture without using a tripod without getting some blur.Add another $100 or so and get a camera that is actually usable to take pictures.Maybe buy this thing for the kids (if it gets cheap enough), otherwise pass on it."
2,You get what you pay for,"I got this camera for myself for Christmas and I must say the $140 I paid for it was DEFINITELY too much. The photo quality is poor as a webcam. There is barely any detail. As far as using it as a digital cam, it projects too much of a contrast and really focuses on shadows. The quality is just poor. I was too happy to replace it when I got the money. If you are taking pictures of things such as scenery outside, then it is ok. As far as people, no. It makes everything look terrible."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting a 2MB smart media card -- shame on me for not reading very carefully -- the real bummer is that this ONLY transfers via USB -- it's fine for my desktop, but not for my laptop. It may take nice photos - but if I can't get them out of the camera it's of no use. Seems silly not to have added a serial interface."
5,"Small, light and easy to use","I have owned this little camera since June 2000. I have an excellent SLR system for slides and a very good point and shoot camera for prints so was interested in a digital camera that was small light simple and could be put in a pocket when I'm riding my motor cycle, out in the sports car or just walking around.The resolution is adequate for point and shoot pictures, nothing can get damaged, my 4 yr old Granddaughter can use it easily, as can any one else who has used it.Down loading is very quick and easy, I very seldom modify any pictures, resizing if anything. About 1400 photos have been takenBest quality photos are head & shoulder pict. inside in fairly even light. The flash is ok just read up on it's range.Outside landscapes lack detail, low pixel count doesn't help. Easy on batteries ,I use nicad recharables and carrry an extra 2.Check out some photos at http://ca.photos.yahoo.com/pl1988"
4,Sam's in the classroom,"Hi, I'm using this textbook in a classroom with some Grade 10 students, and to teach myself Flash as well. I find the book good over all, but some of the exercises have been difficult.The instructions don't work as written sometimes, and I have to 'feel around' the program to figure out what I'm supposed to do to get the expected result. I'm not sure if that's because I'm not understanding things clearly, or if I have a slightly different version of Flash. The book is for Flash MX 2004 and I have Flash MX 2004 professional. I don't know if that would make a difference. The book is a comprehensive introduction broken into manageable lessons. The kids find the exercises fairly manageable, but the lessons in between the exercises are written at a bit of a high reading level for them."
2,Good if you get it from the local Library for free,"Useful book, but not ereror checked thoroughly and not consistent and clear in its presentation. Books dealing with action script and code must be concise and thoroughly tested. This book was not. Glad I didn't pay for it."
2,Pretty Good until you get to the actionscripting part,"I was going through this book fairly well untilllllllllll.......... I came to the actionscripting chapters. Some work fine but I kept coming to exercises where I kept saying what the *#&^ am I doing wrong! I thought the big problem was I has flash mx instead of flash mx 2004, I guess I was wrong. As I read the other users reviews I discovered there are a lot of errors. I would have recommended this book but not anymore. Don't get this book unless you want to use it as a target from frustration.Oh and you cannot get the downloads to work."
4,Great launching pad...,"Kerman pretty much hit it on the head for me to get started authoring computer-based training in Flash. He explains things concisely and succinctly.Pretty much a ""to the point"" kind of tutorial book. Although, it would have been nice to have a companion CD, Kerman has placed many of the excercises on a website for book owners. He has also been extremely accessible."
1,Be careful!!!,If you are interested in buying the ebook be aware that is not the same book. The ebook is for flash mx not for flash mx 2004. Amazon shouldn't have this link here it's confusing.
1,Too Much Text and Not Enough Tasks,I do not recommend this book. It has page upon page of theory and not nearly enough step-by-step instruction. And the author continually refers the reader to examples that supposedly come with the Flash software but are nowhere to be found. This leads to frustration and confusion about what he's talking about. I'm sure there are better books out there.
2,Learn faster for free,"I am new to flash, but found nothing in the book that either the samples or online tutorials did not already show and teach you to do. I would recommend using those resources first, then buying another book that will show you what flash professional can really do."
3,"Sorry, not this one","I purchased this book and I have advanced half way through it, but I am giving up on the book.PROS: Gives lots of detail. The author tries to leave nothing to chance, so that you will not get lost. Some good tutorials. The author really knows his stuff.CONS: My edition was published in 2002, and it is now 2005. I think that it is referring to a pre MX 2004 version, because some of the instructions do not apply to my MX 2004 version of Flash, and that makes it hard to impossible to work some things out. I have decided that I need a more current book. He goes into lots of wordy detail, and I can see why, but it gets a bit too much after a while.I don't like writing negative reviews, but I felt that buyers in 2005, should be warned."
3,Canon EF80-200mm f4.5-5.6 II,"This lens is cheap and very light. Admittedly I wasn't very impressed at first, but with addition of a sigma UV filter my pictures at 200mm are now clearer and a truer reflection of the subject. At 200 the pictures tend to be a bit soft, but it's noticeable unless you do some serious cropping. With this lens I also prefer to shoot with auto zoom instead of manual zoom."
3,When I Get Bigger,This book is called when I get bigger and it's about a kid that cant wait to grow up and he's talking about all the things he can do. Then in the end he realizes that you can still do thing when you were little than when you are grown up. It teaches you that being grown up isn't always fun. I would recommend it to a 1st or 2nd grader. This is about a 6 or 7-year-old child.
5,Great books!,I bought this book for all of my neices and nephews and they all love it. They are well writen and illistrated and easy for them to pay attention to.
5,Univeral Story,"What kid doesnt dream about and talk about all the things they are going to do ""when they get bigger"".My 3 year old nephew LOVED this story and it kept his attention and sparked great converstation."
4,"Not my favorite Little Critter, but not bad","We have a lot of Little Critter books, and why not? They're short, they're funny, they're topical, and they're cheap.This one isn't my favorite.Little Critter talks about all the small things he'll do when he's bigger, like buying all the candy he wants. And then he finishes with a quick tag onto bedtime - he HAS to go to bed, because he's Not Bigger Yet.It's not a bad book, it's just not that interesting to my nieces."
4,I'm a big girl now,"I liked this book because it made me think about what I get and have to do when I'm older. Of course they are different than crossing the street alone and going to the store by myself. This should be good for kids because they get to see what they can look forward to when they become older. This book is short, simple and to the point, just like I like them!"
5,Worth every penny,"This item retracts when not in use so that you can put your lens cap on. I use it after my UV filter and it serves as a ""bumper"" for my lens."
4,Point off for bad smell!,My favorite feature is that the shade folds up like a accordion making it easier to store the camera without having to screw on the shade everytime. Now if only I could do something about that nasty rubber smell! I am surprised Tiffen didn't use less foul-smelling material.
3,makes me shhh,"I don't know, I eat this stuff and I end up on the toilet for the next 45 minutes rather than working out. I also tried taking with a lactose enzyme and that didn't help at all."
4,Pretty good!,"Taste like chocolate ice cream that is barely sweet. Taste best when using a blender with ice. I have only mixed it with milk and it taste pretty good. I have not dared to use water. I have used a blender bottle and it is a little harder to mix. Even with the blender bottle with with the ball whisk. You don't get clumps but for some reason it is much better using a blender. The shake itself is good and enjoyable drinking it. You will not make a funny face or hold your breath while you drink it. I will buy a gain with no problem. Plus, it is filling."
2,Misleading and bad tasting..,"I bought this because of the advertised high protein content, but the amount of protein listed is only if you use two scoops. I tried two scoops and got pudding in my shaker! Plus the taste was intolerable, I couldn't force myself to use it for more than a week!"
5,Love this product,"This is a easy way to supplement your protein and omega 3 intake. And most importantly, it tastes great. I have been using Complete Protein shake mix for over five years, I highly recommend this product."
4,Growing on me,"I used to use the protein powder that is sold at Crunch gyms, but it was too expensive for the size (20 servings) and you can't find it anywhere else. After doing some research, I thought this was the best substitute given the nutritional and price value. The only thing is that it doesn't have fiber so I bought a (reasonably priced, organic) fiber supplement to add. The fiber is too thick to dissolve completely in the shake. The protein by itself is good in a shaker bottle. At first, I was not a fan of the flavor (it definitely does not compare to my old protein shake in terms of taste). But once I drank it a few times, I forgot about the other one, and now I enjoy the taste of this! It has helped me continue on with my fitness regimen and it is great after workouts or as a light meal substitute in between work and the gym. 4 stars since there is no fiber. Otherwise, it's good product for a great price!"
4,Very Low Carb,"I was looking for a vanilla base for making low carb smoothies. This protein drink mix has worked okay for this. I haven't tried too many others, so I'm still giving it 4 stars. That being said, I will probably try something different next. On the plus side, this mix has very low carbs per serving."
1,disappointed,"this is a doublesided disc and i was very disappointed with the quality of the movie.it skipped so bad on both sides it couldn't be watched, my grandson cried because he couldn,t watch his chomper.he is only 2. from now on i will only buy seperate discs and maybe i won't have this promblem"
3,A little rough for the little ones.,"The first story is good, but it's too violent for 2 and 3 year olds. Just a caution if you're buying for that age group."
5,My 3 year old daughter is obsessed!,"My kids, 5 year old son and three year old daughter, are in love with the Land Before Time series and they were so excited to be introduced to the Chomper character in this double feature. Really a great series for kids, although I am a little concerned about the rather scary ""sharptooth"" segments and the potential for nightmares. I'm sure we will eventually be buying all of the movies. We have one 4-episode DVD of the cartoons that were/are being shown on the Cartoon Network, and they seem to love these as much or even more than the full length movies."
3,wrong item,"I received wrong item (The land before time I), i keep it because it was chritsmas gift..."
4,dark humor---library book,"ROALD DAHL..sept 1916 to 23 nov 1990.bio by-Jeremy TREGLOWN. 6/5/1995.He was a fighter pilot and an intelligence officer.He was also a novelist,short story writer,poet and ascreen writter.It is said of him that when he was GOOD--he was VERYGOOD....But...when he was BAD ... he was Horrid and Ruthless.He wrote for children and adults.He was UNSENTIMENTAL and had a VERY-DARK HUMOR.He was married 2x and had 5 kids.HIS LIFE WAS ONE TRAGEDY AFTER ANOTHER.--------------a good rEAd ! I LOVE all HIS BOOKS.bbbokc ok63 retired"
4,Storm Gray = lilac purple,"The storm gray has a slight purple sheen making it lilac in color...Just a note, since I ordered it for my boyfriend"
3,"Leatherman XE6 Juice, Storm Gray","This is a good starter knife, but I tend to really like the old style Wave knife. It has a great selection of small blade type screw drivers. They are just right for spreading electrical prongs on trailer plugs found on semi trailers. Is it possible to find an old style Wave? I lost mine and I really miss it.Please let me know if its possible.(...)I gave the Leatherman XE6 Juice, storm gray to my Grandson."
4,Scottish Indie Pop Like Teenage Fanclub,"Featuring members of BMX bandits, with help from teenage fanclub, this cd is more than a side project. The songs are more upbeat, toe-tapping pop tunes than either recent effort by any of the above. The songs are very melodic. If you like fanclub and bmx, this is a must-have cd. I like this cd for its faster-paced, but very tuneful melodies."
3,"Not a great book, but okay...","This book has a couple of projects (baby oragami jacket and baby bunny jacket) that are very darling and I have made many times. My major beef with it, especially on the baby bunny jacket, is that no time was taken to produce simpler instructions when there was clearly an opportunity to do so. No one wants to seam 7 pieces together, pick up and knit miles of i-cord and tuck in a zillion ends for a jacket that will fit a child for 6 months, if that. Over time, I have modified the patterns to eliminate seams and ends and it's definitely possible. Maybe Vogue should come out with ""Baby Knits Two: Patterns Revisited and Rethought""."
4,"If you're looking for retro-country, Ray Condo's your man.","I started out with BR5-49. Ray Condo goes a step beyond. You can't help but tap your feet to his music. I got Door to Door Maniac two months ago, and haven't gotten tired of it yet! I'll more than likely end up buying all of his CDs"
5,OUTSTANDING TECH-TOY!,"First, I know next to nothing about the technical aspects of these products. I've had this model for a month and here's what I know: This monocular is lightweight and very easy to use (just 3 buttons). I bought the inexpensive battery at the supermarket. At night with a distant street light and a quarter moon I could just make out the form of a cat over a hundred feet away, but with the infrared spotlight switched on I could see the cat in detail, like it was the middle of the day. I read the reviews of all the night vision products and decided on this slightly more expensive model. You can get some for less money, and they might be just as good; I don't know for sure. I went with this one and love it! If it suddenly dies on me or works poorly, I'll write another review to let you know."
3,Night Owl Explorer Pro 5x Night Vision Scope w/I/R Illuminator,This scope would have a better score by me if it would work properly. As of now it doesn't focus on infinity because focusing rings were assembled incorrectly. Will attempt to repair...
2,Not really,"I thought this unit was kind of cheap. Not what I was expecting. I was looking for something cool, like in the movies and this was definetly not it."
3,Yes and No,It is good for general landscapes when there is very little light. But it does not have the power to easily illuminate small animals. Great for camping trips.
1,HUGE image defect near the center of the field of view.,"Review:Unit had a very large defect in the field of view. It's not one of the usual spots from the intensifier tube; those I am aware of as I have other night vision devices. This goes about 1/4 of the way across, near the center. Had to return it. Poor quality control.Update - the new one does not have any image defects. It also doesn't focus as sharply as the first one did (or my other one does), but it isn't too bad."
4,"Handy Night Vision, With Limitations Of Course","It's a nice little product and works very well. It took me awhile to get the battery cover off though as I'm guessing they used a pneumatic drill at the factory to put that on. I use it in the city, commensurate with my job, though and any type of red light or walk light will not be helpful for you seeing anything. But what you pay for this little handy device isn't bad and it works within the restrictions of the tech."
1,Unreliable for me,I took good care of it. Never dropped. Broke after only a couple months. Total usage - maybe 20 times. Unbelievable. Other than that it was pretty good.
1,"great price, until you try to use it....",got stranded due to weak battery (barely turned over). i was psyched to use this thing... but didn't work despite being fully charged. needed to get a jump from a good samaritan anyway.
3,"I LOVE SpongeBob, but I hate the way they fleece me over 2 volumes, one season","I LOVE SpongeBob, but I hate the way they fleece me over 2 volumes, one season. This is highway robbery. When I buy a season, I shouldn't have to shell out twice for 2 separate volumes. :( The SpongeBob episodes are terrific and I am such a fan that I will buy it anyway, but I'll be grumbling all the way to the check-out line."
1,SpongeBob Goes Downhill,"I had gotten the first volume of Season 6 and I was overall pleased. However, it seems that the episodes have really gone downhill here. I couldn't even watch the entire episodes of 90% of them! I liked ""Pineapple Fever,"" but it's really only a re-working of season 3's ""Club SpongeBob."" ""Cephalopod Lodge,"" and ""Chum Caverns"" were also OK, but I'm not getting SpongeBob on DVD any more. Take my advice and get seasons 1, 2, and 3!"
2,Bulb good - packaging not. Arrived broken!,The bulbs I purchased were fine but the Amazon packaging was not which meant that half of the product was broken by the time it arrived. Rather than being carefully packaged the bulbs were simply placed in a folded up piece of cardboard with no fragile sticker or anything to indicate that it was glass inside. Not impressed.
5,Truly Amazing,"This is one on the tightest, sickest, straight rock albums I have heard in years. This is their self produced debut CD and it is incredible. If you thought rock was dead - listen and learn. Excellent writing and some of the catchier rock tunes you will ever hear. Violet Furs and Technology will invade your psyche for weeks to come.Enough said. Now Get heeeem."
4,Bulb Works Very Well,I have used this lamp for nearly 2 years now- rotating to a new one every 6 months because UVB bulbs don't last longer than that. This is a good lamp and the company is good to work with. No complaints.
3,Very Misleading,When I bought this fluorescent lamp so 2 of my turtles would have UVB light I received not a lamp but the light bulb instead. Oh well I guess I will keep the light bulb but next time I am shopping for the lamp I am going to attempt to search carefully while I am reading the descriptions and I will look at the customer reviews to make sure it is a actual lamp. Don't let the title fool you if you want the light bulb buy this but if you want the actual lamp look for it at the other products.
3,A general reader.,"Engaging in a diatribe against his fellow academicians can only result in allienating his general reading public. He should engage in those discussions in his journals, not in a book meant for the general reader. I found his arguments exceedingly boring."
2,What a disappointment,"I had heard good things about this author and was excited to read this book. I was very disappointed. The author presents a rather emotional polemic against what he, somewhat unjustly, refers to as ""revisionists"" at the expense of presenting a well-reasoned argument of his own point of view. The book had disappointingly little to say about the subject of it's title. If you would like to read a book that actually examines ""What the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It"" I would recommend Richard Friedman's ""Who Wrote the Bible."""
4,Sweet Book,"My girls love this book. It is a loving, sweet story that makes you feel good. The illustrations in it are wonderful too. It is a perfect bed time story!"
4,A really sweet book,This is a charming book which is especially suited for young children and which also makes a wonderful bedtime book. A nice gift for a little one.
2,Book Feels Incomplete,The book allows the reader a little glimpse inside the daily lives of charedi mitnagdim women. She always refers to her former life as a member of this group. But the reader is left in the dark as to why she left it or what was it that finally made her leave. The ending left me wondering if there was more. It didn't seem complete in the end and just leaves you hanging. One can't tell if she's glad to have left the charedi world or if she wishes she was back in it. The author goes back and forth a lot. I agree with one reader that the author herself got in the way of what could have been a terrific book.
4,Why the author left the community,"It seemed obvious to me that she left the charedi world because of her daughters. She absolutely did not want them to go through the ""shidukh"" (matchmaking) process."
1,Bootleg,"Bootleg alert! I am also a collector and trader of Led Zeppelin and other live concerts. It is not worth it to buy this. In some countries, it is in fact illegal to buy these. If you want it, you should seek out traders and make deals with them. It should never be any cost to you, and the traders will trade you for a bootleg you have, or for blank CD's and postage (B & P trading). Do not buy bootlegs, ever, when you can trade them for free."
2,C:13:00 Error Club,"Sony DVP S560D - DVD player - blackDVP S560D, Worked Great until I joined the C:13:00 Error Club, Google ""Sony C:13:00"" to find out more."
3,"Good packaging, but box needs more truth up front.","I like the way it is packaged but it would be better if they mentioned that the book by Les Daniels is a condensed version of his Superman: The Complete History. From whay I can see in side by side comparisons, the Golden Age history is word for word from the first book (they did include a complete comic story that wasn't in the first one, however). Also, they state that the Superman #1 reprint is accurate size. I have my doubts. I own Superman #24 from a few years later, obviously, and it is about 1/2 inch larger in dimensions on the top and side. The statue is nice, though. I feel the package is worth it at Amazon's discount price but not full retail."
3,A lot of opinions and generalizations,"I had higher hopes for this book. The author fairly eloquently advances a bunch of opinions, but (1) how about backing it up with research about what testing methodologies ""work"" or what the impact of these methodologies are and (2) how about some sense of how a teacher could actually implement these methodologies that are more ""free-form""? His examples of a Harvard University exam are nice, but perhaps a little daunting."
5,Awesome air intake,Easy to install and now the engine can breathe! I put this intake on my '02 RSX and now it has more torque and HP in the higher RPM's.
4,K&N Typhoon for EP3 Si,"Installed quickly and easily in an '04 Civic Si - hardest part was taking the factory system out. Virtually indistinguishable from stock below 3500 rpm, but gets a lot louder very quickly after that. Not what I would consider obnoxious by any stretch (at least not with the stock exhaust), but does provide some nice aural feedback when accelerating hard or rev-matching toe-and-heel downshifts.I can't really say that 5hp is noticeable, though. I was actually hoping to get a small boost in gas mileage more than anything, but I installed it just as the temps dropped I swapped summer tires for aggressive snow tires, so it's hard to measure any meaningful difference. Due to the design of the Civic's engine bay, I'm a bit concerned about it becoming dirty quite quickly, and am considering one of the filter wraps for winter driving. Will check more closely when I install a frost plug heater next month."
5,"Quick, Easy, and Effective!","For less than an hour of your time you can extract much more fun from your RSX or Civic Si. The sound and performance increase are noticeable above the lower RPMs, around 4500 or so. I would absolutely recommend this product. Vroooooom!"
5,"simple, easy hp gain","Searched around and this was the best price for a new k&n short ram intake polished. The actual intake is much more shiny than the picture but i think it looks good. Installation took me about 30 minutes wasn't bad at all and it definitely makes the engine sound louder than stock. Hp gain is small but noticeable and the engine especially in vtec sounds much better and the vtec crossover is much more noticeable. The intake whistles on part throttle and it was a little distressing but i have gotten use to it. Overall a great product for a great price, if your looking to buy an intake you cant go wrong with this one, fairly cheap and a million mile warranty."
2,doesn't sound right,"I don't think the songs were remixed correctly on this record, and the stuff from the 70's is pretty awful. The production of each song is drastically different from song-to-song making for annoying continuity, which is a shame because the songs are great. ""Troggs on 45 medley"" is absolutely terrible."
4,"Well, it's a dictionary.","Amazon had some crazy deal going at the time and I picked up two of these for [money] shipped to my door. For that price, it's a good deal :) Actually, I've found it rather useful. It does seems like a good dictionary to get you through high school or college. I have ran across a few words that were not in the book, but with my computer and internet on all the time, it's faster just to surf on over to an online dictionary."
1,This is a bad book,I bought this book because we have to read the spanish version in school. I think the stories are dull but it is helping me in class.
5,Allergy relief,"I don't have any allergies but my brother has. I got this book and before giving it to him I read it. It explains what allergy is, what causes it and of course how to deal with it. If you suffer from allergies, i believe this is the book for you to cure them naturally. My brother (who is also against any form of medication) is already doing MUCH MUCH better after following the instructions in this book; improve his immune system, make the environment around him better and understand what allergy is. Simple steps you can take will lead to better living without much effort really. The book is simply written, easy to understand, which I find to be very important. Some books are heavy and boring because there are authors who think that they talk to other doctors and not to simple people who did not study medicine (Sorry for that). Allergy problem? I don't think you will find a better book on the subject than this."
5,Superb Tribute to One of the Best Albums Ever Recorded,Billy Sherwood does it again - compiled a master list of prog rock geniuses to pay tribute to one of the greatest albums of the rock era - essential listening for ALL fans!!!
5,Blurton Lends a Hand To Saskadelphia Bros.,"From the ashes of the Age of Electric, for the first time officially on their own, the Dahle bros. release a masterpiece. The lyrics are Pixies esq, the music is more diverse than the debut, and Ian Blurton (ex change of heart frontman) plays on a track. How much better can it get?"
2,Okay,I already knew most of these. I was hoping for something with more of the head wrap/scarf methods.
1,arrived cracked,The package arrived timely and in good condition but the recipe box was cracked along the hinge area. Easy to return and got a refund with no problem.
2,skip it,"I am so disappointed in this video. I have a few phonics videos for my sons, and this is the most expensive and the least useful. They won't even watch it. The animation is awful, and I see very little educational value. I have better phonics videos that cost $9.99. What a waste."
3,A scary subject was made understandable.,"When I went to law school, I was told to avoid conflicts like the plague. This lecture series helped alleve (sp?) my fears. If you have an understanding of civil procedure, you can get the gist of this subject. The lecturer has a dead-pan voice that may turn off some listeners. Also, so many of the most exemplary cases involve out-of-state car fatalities and divorce cases, so be prepared to be depressed. Still, I found these tapes useful. I'm a little concerned that the professor could have added more material. Still, I found his lecture to be a valuable study aid."
1,a shame,"I find it immensely painful and intolerably unjust that any human being could possibly believe the Holocaust did not happen. The only value of this essay is that it reminds us that there are people in the world who would dare deny such an attrocity, and that we must continue to educate future generations on the horrors man is capable of inflicting upon man. I only give this one star because I have to in order to print my review."
2,Ridiculous,"It is quite pathetic indeed that anyone can deny the horrors of World War II, when hundreds of historians agree on it. Of course, there will always be the few who stick out. Much of this book is made entirely of fabrications which has been disproved again and again since it's publication. The bias in this so called 'historical' book is barely hid, if at all. I only give it two stars because he raised a very few good points. However, much of this book, as stated above, is terribly biased. The author claims that much of what we feel is the truth about the Holocaust is lies, but people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones..."
2,Not compatible with newer IPOD Nanos,"The overall package was very cute. However, the prongs did not line up. I was not able to connect IPOD nano to speaker jack. This product does not work with the newer model nanos."
1,Product Compatibility Misrepresented,"I called iBratz customer service prior to ordering this product to ask if this was compatible with iBratz MP3 Player and was informed that this product was made for the MP3 Player. When I got the product not only did it not work with the MP3 Player but it was designed for the Apple iPod, which clealy is not indicated on any part of the website advertisement for Amazon or iBratz. I was very disappointed, as this was a Christmas gift for my daughter."
4,Very fast shipment but...,"The service was outstanding and the product shipped very fast. However, I had to cut out the design and had a lot of the lines fill with ink because the foam just wasn't thick enough though I haven't seen any much thicker than what this company sells. It was great to learn on but my students were disappointed that the background could not be pressed enough to eliminate and the ink filled in too many of the unwanted areas."
3,Flimsy - doesn't measure up to Catherine,"Apparently the research on Josephine is flimsy, and so too is Erickson's characterization of the empress. She's vain, materialistic, none-too-bright, and appears to have a dental problem. That's about as deep as Erickson gets into her title lady. Disappointing mostly because I'd read Catherine the Great first, and was so impressed with the way Erickson made the people and the history so accessible and alive. I gave it a 3 because it was reasonably entertaining and I learned more about Napolean history here than all my college history classes. But don't count on gaining any great insights into the Empress."
4,An Unlikely Empress,"This was my first read of Carolly Erickson, and I was enthralled by her writing style. Yes, the book reads like a novel, but I don't find this detrimental. One of the biggest problems with historical biographies are they are often heavy and dull, and I don't think this should be the case when describing extraordinary times and events. I felt like I was transplanted ""into the period;"" and while Josephine had qualities pro and con, I found her to be accessible and human. A lot of times with biographies, I ended hating the subject by the time I am done, because the author relishes revealing the subject's tarnished persona in such an unflattering light. Ms. Erickson's Josephine I liked, despite her evident flaws.My only complaint would be overindulgence in trivial detail, e.g., her ""rotten teeth"" and ""fading beauty."" No one really likes aging, do they?"
3,Josephine - full of tears,"Though this book gives the reader insight into Josephine Bonaparte and the life in the late 1700's and early 1800's the writing is lacking in richness and at times choppy - no expansion on the descriptions to create the real vision, taste, sense or feel of what was going on. There was much more the author could have added to embrace the difficulties of Josephine's life and this volatile time in history. And though this was a book about Josephine, I felt the lack of historical references to event's happening in and to France left the mind questioning about how that impacted the lives of the people at the time, and may have been an insight into all the tears."
4,Empress of the French,"This is the third book I've read by Carolly Erickson and I have not once been disappointed. Miss Erickson successfully brings history to life in each of her books, this time taking on the tumultuous life of Josephine, future wife of Bonaparte and Empress of France. From the beginning you realize how many harrowing events Josephine went through, sometimes emerging a stronger person, sometimes not. Despite all that, she was devoted to her children and extended family, never forgetting where she came from and what she wished to achieve for them after she had gone. Remaining popular with the people up until her death, Josephine always expressed kindness and generosity to all she met, despite station, friend or foe. Miss Erickson is a good biography writer and I look forward to reading another in her ever growing collection."
4,Josephine:A Life of the Empress,"Recently my curiosity was aroused when I saw a movie of Josephine's stature which I had taken in Martinique about 1958 - I realized that I had never read anything about her. I finally retired in 2007 at age 81 after sixty years in executive positions in U.S.Navy (at sea then flying blimps and an SNJ carrier plane) mining, manufacturing and commercial real estate brokerage. I have enjoyed a retirement home with my wife of 58 years. On the Internet I researched Empress Josephine and ordered the Caroley Erickson biography. It has taught me so much about the lives and times of Napoleon and his Empress, and I would recommend it to readersinterested in the era of the French Revolution. Politics, rulers, morals and sexuality are covered in interesting detail."
4,This Rose was no saint,"I found this a very enjoyable and lively biography of Josephine Tasher de Beauharnis. Josephine (or Rose, as she was called for most of her life), lived a life full of incredible changes. She went from poor colonial outcast to an aristocratic survior of the French Revolution, to end up as Empress of the French.This is not a dry biography, which is full of endless quotes. Instead, the author has researched the times Josephine lived in and tried to fill in the blanks on the situations her life choices were made in. These ""guesses"" as to Josephine's emotional state are made clear when not supported by direct documentry evidence. However, they do serve to bring the empress to life in this very interesting book.This is a book I enjoyed, and gave a good description of the world Josephine lived in and did it's best to give us the facts (not the fantasy) on her life."
2,Interesting in the beginning,Lost my interest because it was so focused on her relationship with her father while I was more interested in learning about the camino.Carole
1,What was advertised was not what they sent me!,"Online Sports advertised an authentic Texas Tech NCAA full size helmet. It was priced better than other sites that I had searched, so I bought it. They sent me a replica helmet. When I brought this mistake to their attention, they admitted that they had made a mistake on their advertisement but refused to send me what I ordered. Instead they offered a 10% discount on the authentic helmet. The principle of getting what was advertised and paid for doesn't have any meaning for Online Sports and I will never order from them again! If the retailer makes a mistake, they should own up to it and honor the original agreement. It just makes for good business!"
1,One Star just because it is attractive.,"I got this baby home and plugged it in. The indicator light for the smaller burner did not light up. It was apparently broken out of the box. The temperature control knobs are almost as if they are on a child's cooktop. There is no definitive ""click"" for off, so I would be worried that it gets bumped ""on"".But still I loved the look of it, so I tried to cook with it. It took 24 minutes to bring about 2.5 quarts of water to a boil, and this was in a highly conductive copper pot. Guess what? It's going back.And an interesting side point, the Rival website doesn't list this as one of their products. My guess is that it was discontinued because it was engineered so poorly."
1,truly a piece of junk,"I bought a Rival Buffet Range at a local Target on Dec. 30, 2006. Within three weeks, the knob for the right hand burner broke off while the unit was on, so that the only way to use that burner was to plug and unplug it. I have the receipt, but Target requires returns to be in new condition in the original box. So I wrote to Rival, saying I would like a refund. I definitely did not want a repair or a replacement. Their answer: ""Hello,I just received your e-mail, thank you for writing in. I do apologize that we will not be able to issue you any type of refund/credit since the product was not purchased directly from us, what we can do is send out a replacement if you agree. Thank you."" How many people purchase consumer products directly from the manufacturer? What a ripoff."
1,Junk,I purchased my Rival hot plate elsewhere but it is still junk no matter where it came from. Had it about 90 days when one of the control knobs came off the front; used small plyers on the wire just inside for control until the wire disapeared inside. The manufacture of this poorly engineered Rival product is a waste of resources and energy. DO NOT BUY.
5,Double Burner Hot Plate,This is a great product which allows me the freedom to cook outside or in the garage avoiding the heat in the house. The heating elemets heat evenly and quickly.
1,Cheaply made. Nob fell off in 2 months,"OK, first, I didn't expect much for 39.99. I picked this up at home depot, not Amazon cause my gas cooktop needed replacing. The heating unit isn't great and it can take a while to boil water, but it works well enough. The big problem was that about 6 weeks into using this, one of the nobs fell off. That didn't bother me so much because I could still turn it with the metal ring that the nob used to be attached to, but a day or two later, that ring came unhinged, and the hotplate was permanently set to on. Maybe it's fixible if I was to take it appart, but it seems awfully cheaply made. next time I'll not buy the cheapest model and I recommend you avoid this one. One of the burners will works, so, I'd give it 1.5 stars."
1,STOP - Don't waste your money,Bought this to use in our temporary outdoor kitchen whilst we remodeled.After 2 months one of the control knobs fell off the left plate. We didn't abuse it in any way.1 month later the same plate decided it only had one heat setting - HOT - and would not turn itself off. We had to keep unplugging at the mains.And now that very same hot plate is now a permanently COLD PLATE. Won't heat up at all.The right hot plate is more of a warm plate. Not enough power to bring anything to the boil. Had to boil water in the kettle and bring it over!Utterly ridiculous and hideous piece of cr@p.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1,Beautiful but flawed,"I love the look of this burner, I gave it two tries, the first one I bought, a knob came off soon after i got it, and one burner wouldn't turn off.( I of course I didn't keep warrenty ), is there one?andThe new one I have , one burner buzzes when turned to high, and the knobs feel like they could go any minute,It is so good looking but I can't have it not work again!!"
4,"Review of Four Gospels, One Jesus: A Sybolic Reading",The book was requied for a Synoptic Gospel course I was enrolled in.I found it to a great study tool. It points out similarities and differences in the writing styles and approach of the authors. Very helpful as a student.
3,Very good for its time,"Hall reviews christian history with a keen eye, but with an erring interpretation of many of the heresies he covers. (Not that all is wrong, in fact once or twice while reading I saw bits of brilliance.) The book is simply dated, but that was part of the point of reading it. I wanted to see an interpretation of heresy from a different time period than what most christians now believe. I do recommend the books to any serious students in the field of Christian History."
5,Simply Seductive,"Based on past reading experience with Julia Ross's books, I began reading THE SEDUCTION with very high hopes. I was not disappointed. Taking place during the Georigan period, the settings and costumes are absolutely luscious! The main characters, Alden and Juliet, seem to be as opposite as 2 people can be -- who only meet due to Alden losing a wager.Throughout the story, Juliet and Alden's interactions -- and the reasons for how they act -- flow and intermingle so smoothly it is hard to put the book down. These characters get under your skin. And the writing is so fantastic (elegant, smooth, accessible) that I immediately began a reread upon completion. I cannot recommend this book enough!"
2,"Great Writing, Bad Story","The writer is very talented with words. But those words just don't add up to a great story. The story is too unrealistic. I don't care for the hero or the heroine. The hero was too much of a casanova type for me and its hard to find a man who wears powder/rouge/heels attractive. I know during that time period this was in fashion, but, the very detailed descriptions displayed the hero more feminine than masculine! It didn't help when his enemy tried to kiss him! Now the heroine is too bitter throughout the entire book. She hates men b/c of how her marriage turned out. She takes her anger out on the hero all the time. Throughout she's always seeking to hurt his feelings when he never does anything to provoke her, aside from the bet which he doesn't even go through with. The scarce sex scenes are awful. The first is done in a completely dark room where they can't even see each other and they are over in a few sentences. This book pretty much sucks!"
3,Lacking,"This was a well written book. Almost like reading poetry. There were things that I didn't like though. I just couldn't relate with these characters at all. All of the erotic sex talk that took place during the first half of the book was more exciting than when they actually did have sex. Actually that was the extent of the dialogue. Sex, sex, sex. I realize that he was trying to seduce her but it got a little irritating after a while. Then because he finds that he wants her more than any other woman he has ever met or been with he thinks he's in love. I think this was the first woman that didn't roll over after ten minutes so he was forced to realize that she had a brain and could speak. Five days without having sex must have been complete torture!! I just couldn't like these two characters. One was too arrogant and the other too bitter."
5,Be seduced!,"This book is as seductive as title -- the characters will wrap themselves around your heart and you won't want to let go. The writing is evocative and textured, much like Judith Ivory or Liz Carlyle in that very smart, very finely drawn characterizations that make it feel like you know these people. Don't miss this treat - it's one you will read again!"
4,would buy it again,sturdy and works well with my grandson's wooden train set. the noise it makes is just loud enough and the gates are sturdy
5,Cute accessory for our Grandson's starter set. He loves it!,This is a great addition to any set. It works well yet it is simple and easy to understand for the Thomas nubie ;- The flashing lights and sound were a surprise... I must have missed that info in the description online.
4,Deluxe RR Crossing for Wooden Thomas and Friends,"Lights, sound, and gates you can move. My sons have fun using this with the wooden Thomas track, or without. Sometimes they use this to play with cars instead of the Thomas toys. Fun accessory and well crafted."
3,Not worth the price.,Really don't think this is worth the price. Bought it for my Nephew to go with other Thomas the train set & gets stuck & doesn't open every time.
5,Worth it!,This Deluxe railroad crossing makes a great addition to my 2.5 year old's train set. I like how moving the arms make the sounds or you can press the red button. It looks fantastic and it was very affordable.
1,Does NOT handle rated RMS power!!!,"I had this 12"" Dual 2 ohm Kicker Solo Baric L5 (s12l5) wired to 4 ohm on my Rockford Fosgate t10001bd (500 watts RMS @ 4 ohm) and the voice coil burnt out after an hour. When I pulled the woofer out of the box it was so hot I couldn't even keep my hand on it. I would not put anything more than 300 watts RMS into these subs if you want them to last."
3,OK unless you end up in court,"The book covers many legal situations. More than most people should have to deal with in a lifetime.The book gives a high level discussion of the pertinent issues. In a situation where you need legal advice, this book can help you know what types of questions to ask. It can also help you understand why the attorney is doing what he is doing.However, this book will NOT provide legal advice. It will not qualify you to plead your own case in front of a judge. In that respect, it can be a little misleading. Otherwise it is pretty good."
4,"Themed Parties, Bruce Lee, or just a love for the music...","This is a slower instrumental eastern sound. It kind of sets me at peace when I hear it. I have many Japanese rock and Taiwanese rock CD's, and it is quite nice to hear a mellow brook, or at least the artists depiction of one, instead of the torture of guitar strings (as my father puts it) I would definatly give this a 5 star if it wasn't a cut out."
5,Great Product!,"I've used 1inch and 2 inch Techflix sleeving at work and decided to use it in my house. Once I received the 1/2"" sleeving I thought, ""There's no way this is going to hold 2 coax cables and 5 speaker wires!"" I was wrong! The sleeving opens up and then moves down the cables like a snake eating it's dinner. The process that I thought was going to take forever (if it was even going to work) took about 10mins. Now I have a single black cable running the length of the wall instead of 7 cables. Very clean, very easy to use!"
1,Not What I Expected,"This is not what I expected. The claim ""clean cut"" is not true. If you must cut to size, the cut immediately frays, comes unraveled and is basically a mess, not the clean look I was hoping for. The half inch is also only suitable for the thinnest of cables with very small end plugs, if any."
2,Not as picture shows,I bought this valve because the drain was shown on the right side. What they sent me had the drain on the left side and this won't work for my application. Beware it's not as picture shows.
5,Every non-Christian could benefit from Christians reading this book.,"If the American church followed the widsom and insight contained in ""Damage Control, How to stop making Jesus look bad,"" I think unbelievers would be even more compelled to accept Christ. In this book, Dean Merrill provides us with a candid look at how those from the outside of Christendom may see those of us on the inside. It's time someone stepped up to the plate and preached this message to the choir. I was challenged, encouraged, and convicted while reading ""Damage Control."" If you are serious about reaching the lost, this is a must read. I enthusiastically recommend this book."
5,Stunningly Insightful,I hope to read this one many times. Each time will generate a new insight; a new revelation. The multi-layers of the human condition are all here in their raw glory. Williams could see well beyond the horizon from the atmospheric veranda at the Costa Verde.Fantastic!
4,Great Tools,"This book is easy to read, easy to understand, and offers a lot of hope. It gives you real tools to use. I wish it had focused just a tiny bit more on how you can only take care of yourself and your own point of view and emotions - or perhaps it would have been nice if they recommended a companion book on that subject - since it is such a large factor in relating. But overall I'd say it's a great buy for anyone looking to find ways to start improving their communication with anyone, right away."
5,Research-proven approach to resolving conflict,"The key to this book is that these aren't just some college professors with their feet on the desk and a pencil in their mouths coming up with some theory about how marriages should work. These are researchers who have observed relationships that do and don't work and have summarized the differences in them - specifically, that happy, healthy relationships are those where conflict is resolved in a constructive way. They then go on to detail exactly how that occurs. This lends an air of credibility to a field where it is sorely needed.I have found this book extremely helpful in my own life, and I have recommended it to many, many people; both friends and patients. It's by far the best book on how to make a relationship successful that I've ever found."
5,Excellent resource for learning to communicate,"Not a bunch of fluff, nor ""getting in touch with the inner child"". Solid, realistic and fair. This is the first resource to actually work for my marriage. After several rounds of live counseling, we had almost given up, but this book reassured us both of the fact that conflict is very common and can be resolved, appropriately. We have learned many new skills and how to apply them to our marriage."
4,Fun,"Don't mislead by the title, because other than cheerleading, this movie has a little (actually, nothing) to do with ""Bring It On."" However, I only say that so that you won't be disappointed if you were expected it to tie in. That said, the movie is fun, and has some great lines and superb actors."
2,"next time you bring it on again, do a better job","It wasn't bad...it was better than I thought it would be. But it was still disappointing and completely unrealistic. I mean, no-one can learn to be an expert cheerleader in such a short amount of time! It requires a mindblowing amount of practice. However, their performance was great and the steps were unique, but just not cheerleader material. Perhaps dance material?All said, it did not match up to Bring it on, which had substance. And wth was up with Whittiers bf? They could've chosen a way better-looking guy! Ugh!"
1,Avoid at all costs!,"Okay, first of all, I LOVED the first Bring It On. It was fun and campy the way that all those great 80's comedies were. But this sequel was just awful! Terribly predictable and completely unrealistic - are we to believe that a bunch of awkward uncoordinated geeks could turn into gymnastic flipping, street dancing, cheerleading gods/goddesses in like 3 weeks? Not only that, but the love story was absolutely wretched (they couldn't have picked two more unappealing leads) and the acting was 10 times worse than a really bad (like the worse) WB show. I could not stand the evil cheerleading chick - she was awful. Everything about it just screamed B-rated Direct-to-Video. The only watchable scene was the final cheerleading performances at the end, which I admit were actually a little better than in the first movie. Other than that, there are no redeeming qualities in this movie. Unless you absolutely have to see it to believe how bad it is, avoid this movie at all costs!"
2,Boring..,"It was an ""OK"" movie, but IF you want to compare it to the first one, you shouldn't. There was less action sequences than the first one, which kind of defeats the purpose of a sequel (shouldn't a sequel be better than the first?). Also, the storyline was also ""OK"", but very predictable in the outcome of the movie. I think the price I paid for the movie was way too much, it needs to be in one of those $6.99 bargin bins."
5,Again,"Thanks alot, this is a really great dvd, grand-daughter just love this dvd...now she thinks that she is a cheerleader....4 years old. She now has the whole entire collection."
5,Love it,"From a straight passionate male, I have always loved cheerleaders for the right reasons.:) Back in my college days I had a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders calendar. Then the cheerleaders were older than me. Time passes, now the girls are much younger. Yet I love them still, as I do the whole franchise of Bring It On, the energy, passion, sassiness, creativity, problem solving...great qualities in many aspects of Life!"
2,Not so good,"Bring it on again is not worth the price. The plot is weak, but the cheer routines are good. Of all the Bring it On movies, this one was the worst--so rent or buy used."
1,SUCKS,"This is one of the worst movie i have ever seen. It's horrible!! Don't buy this DVD, buy Bring It On instead of Bring It On Again."
2,Please don't bring it on again anymore.,"Soooo bad it was almost painful to watch. The movie is not only unrealistic, the acting was very bad and the plot is painful at best. This movie is so far from what Bring it on was, that it is not worth to watch it. We all know that sequels rarely work (there are very few excpetions), this one flunked."
2,Really Corny,"I did not like this movie at all, it is probably one of the worst I've seen recently. The plot was really lame, and an exact rip off of the first movie. The only good part of this movie was a small part by Zach off The OC."
1,C-level movie,"I thought about buying this movie for my sister, who loved the original ""Bring It On"". But before I bought, I decided to rent the movie for myself and see if it was any good. Wow was I dissapointed. The plot is almost identical to the original ""Bring It On"" but characters portrayed less fully and the cinematic quality much lower. My roomate and I fast-forwarded through the slow and painful dialogue to the cheer scenes, but poor film quality hurt the impact of amazing choreography in the cheer sequences. My favorite part of the movie was the cheer-along to the opening clip of the first movie...which I watched twice to rid my mind of second movie. If you liked the first ""Bring It On"", rent this movie first...hopefully you won't regret the loss of 3 bucks."
1,nooooooooo,nothing not good at all.rchs had better cheerleaders than this collge.It was a very not even worth buying.Dont waist your money
1,Wish I could give less than 1 star.....,I decided to give his movie a chance since I did love the first movie. What a mistake!! The plot was boring. I've had more fun in a dentist's office. Not even worth the $5 video rental. Do yourself a a favor... wait until it comes on cable.
3,To be part of a movie,"I am not a fan of the last movie but I'm going to get it since they did some of the filming at my college. My school is Cal State Los Angeles. I am in the crowd somewhere in the opening sequence. It's just like in the first movie where all the cheerleaders ran out. What the extras got in return for participating was a copy of the first Bring It On movie and a few lucky people won a DVD player, digital camcorders, and other stuff in a raffle."
2,"Vastly inferior sequel to ""Bring it On""","""Bring it On Again"" is the second entry in the ""Bring it On"" franchise.It is far inferior to the film that started it all ""Bring it On"" and the third film in the series ""Bring it On - All or Nothing"". The leads in this effort lack personality and the plot is totally ridiculous - yes even for a cheerleading film! The central idea that a bunch of displaced geeks can be turned into cheerleaders is an insult to geeks everywhere.""Bring it On Again"" is also mean-spirited and lacking the humour of the other films."
1,bring it on agian ...sucks,I have one word for u NO. I have no ides how this movie was even made. It totally sucked it was only like 5 mins long no good plot line the most stupid ending i thout it was half way over. i think kristen dunst and the rest of the starts from the hit bring it on! will be very dismointed with it.
5,How To Identify Prints,"As a museum professional and print cataloguer, this book has proved to be an invaluable resourse for identifying myriad print techniques. It is an excellent tool for identifying dates of printing as well. The author describes each printing processes in minute detail, and also provides very good illustrations which are very helpful. As a print connoseur and collector I call this my print-medium bible."
5,A favorite!,"This was my daughters favorite book when she was young. When she was 5, we painted a ceramic ""Dorrie"" with socks that did not match. For Christmas I gave her the ceramic witch and this book. Great memories. Hope her girls will enjoy ""Dorrie and the Blue Witch."""
3,"Good value for a smaller thumbscrew, but YGWYPF","These are OK thumbscrews for some applications if you are a case modder. Because of their smaller-than-normal diameter (compared to other thumbscrews here) they are nice for fastening things in your case that you don't use a lot, like drives and your motherboard. A bit small for exterior case thumbscrews, and the finish varies a bit and is not as nice as more expensive ones from Thermaltake, for example. Still a very good value for the quantity."
5,Nicer than most...,"The body is not as big as most aftermarket thumbscrews but affords plenty of grip. The phillips takes a #2 and is a good tight fit. I'm a traveling VJ, I hold all my cards in and all my server cases together with these. They are ferous, magnetic tips hold them well."
5,Perfect case screws,"Anyone looking to create a tool-free computer would be well advised to go with these little jewels. I recently put together custom computers for my wife and me, and these thumbscrews added the finishing touch I was looking for. The seller got them to me fast, too. Oo-RAH!"
1,Avoid this printer,"This may be a fine printer, but I'll never know because I was shipped two in a row, both DOA. The ""Check Printer"" alert message came up immediately, and the ink cartrige carriage never moved to allow installation of the print head and ink.I don't know if this is a hardware problem or what, but two in a row, c'mon! What will your odds be in getting one that works?The only good thing is Amazon's support. That I'd rate five stars! Fully automated returns and smooth replacement (this second one will be a refund, however). Very impressive."
2,A word of caution,"This printer doesn't have built-in ethernet connection for direct network printing. This means you're required to connect this big thing directly to your computer/laptop. If you want to have it tucked away somewhere convenient instead of your desk, you will need to buy an expensive USB print-server (wired or wireless).For a small business like mine, this is a big downer and a big reason not to buy this product. Otherwise, a great printer with good cartridge prices compared to HP."
5,This is a great All in One!,"After our Epson went out, I did a lot of research to see what we wanted. After reading reviews, we decided on the Pixma MP780. I am NOT sorry that this was our choice. The printing is great, the copies are great and the photos are incredible. I was not really looking for a fax but it came with it. I can't comment on that part as of yet since I haven't used the fax yet. I love the fact that is has seperate ink tanks as most Canons do. This was very easy to set up, as I am no computer expert by any means. For the price and quality, you won't be unhappy with this one."
4,PIXMA Alli In One review,"HiI have been using the unit for about a month now. The only problem I am having is that it feeds paper crooked. If you put the paper in straight, when the first sheet feeds it tilts all of the remaining sheets in the hopper to the side. After the first sheet, they all feed through at an angle. Is there a fix foir this? I have not yet contacted Canon.Other than that, the unit works very well and I am quite pleased.Sean"
4,Good little printer for a home office,I home printing needs are light & this little printer works great & would easily fit into a small office atmosphere. It scans a bit slow & has 3 different programs to do the same thing but it does a great job. Would recommend to anyone.
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this printer brand new and I used it a total of 10-12 times and then it started acting up. It would print blank pages; the user manual is not user friendly. I love Canon camera products, and I took a chance when I purchased this unit. Now I am very disappointed. I was very happy with the Epson printer I use to have. The only reason I bought this printer vs. Epson is because it had Fax as one of the options.Canon gave me the option to have the printer replaced with a refurbish one or have it serviced at one of their authorize dealers. Now you would think they give you a brand new replacement right? Wrong, I decided to have it repaired since I knew it was brand new. Bottom line, I am with out a printer and I don't want somebody else to be in the same situation as I am."
3,"Good, not great","But for the price you get what you pay for. Copies are acceptable, not crisp or finished looking, but since I'm only using that feature to save myself from lugging about textbooks I'm satisifed with the quality. As a printer, text looked fine; can't say much about photo quality, haven't done any yet."
4,Great all arounder,"I read all the reviews out there before I bought the MP780. Yes, the scanner is a bit weak, the color and photo quality are not at the level of true photo printer... but it's a great all arounder for everyday tasks.Great- Text print: sharp and fast- Sanning: good for text and B/W; color is a bit washed- Space saving- Ink consumption is very respectable and the ink is relatively cheap vs HP and Lexmark- Great price for the feature sets versus Epson and HP- Dual side print and auto feeder are standard featureNot so Good- Software are not integrated- you need which sotfware does what- Faxing is cumbersome - multiple steps to go through- Mechanical not as strudy as HP - output tray door can't be closed on second day- Scanner is only average for color reproduction"
2,"Great printer, but now will not print black","I've had this printer for almost three years and I have loved it for most of that time.About 1.5 years ago it started to not print black every once in a while. I would deep clean, remove the print head and clean with alcohol, even bought a new print head, but every few months it does the same thing.I've discovered through searching on the net that many other folks have experienced this same issue."
1,problems with canon pixma mp780,"Canon PIXMA MP780 All-In-One Photo PrinterAlthough I bought this printer a couple of years ago, I rarely used it. In spite of the machine being practically new, it suddenly quit powering up and is now useless. As reported by several other reviewers, it would cost more to fix than it is worth. It seems to me that if this is a frequent problem, then Canon should either replace or fix the machine even when it is out of warranty, or some sort of class action suit should be considered against Canon."
1,Ink problems,"This printer worked well for a month and then started its fits. First the print head had to be replaced. Then, if you left it alone for a week, the cartridges dried up and you'd have to go thru about five cleaning sessions to get it working. Lastly, the LCD would say the cartridges are jammed, even though they weren't. RIP. On to a Brother multifunction."
3,Third times a charm.,"Let me start off by saying I really like this MP, so much so that after TWO bad ones (out of the box!) I was willing to go for a third. Thankfully Stapes has a 14 day return policy.The problem (as documented in other reviews here) is an intermittent ""SCANNER ERROR"" on the LCD display after coming out of Energy Saver Mode. After phone calls to Canons very helpful tech support we determined the printers were malfunctioning. The third one (from a separate later shipment to the same store) works perfect. My only negative points are its size (it doesn't look that big in the store, but man it grew when I got it in the house) and lack of networking capability."
3,ink smears if you touch a black and white page,"I switched from a 7-year-old laser printer to this machine. The print quality is comparable but if you touch a freshly printed black and white page from the Canon the ink will smear. I tried using this as a FAX machine but it was never able to transmit successfully, probably because I have a Vonage voice-over-IP phone and the available quality is not high enough."
2,Don't get this model if you do a lot of scanning,"I am thinking of returning my unit, here is why. The scanner is very slow. My old Canon MP 730 scanned about 3 times faster. I scan a lot of documents to PDF. I called Canon tech support and they were very nice but could not help me improve the scanner speed. The tech support rep did confirm that the MP780 was slower than the older MP 730. Canon really went backwards by having their new model be about 3 times slower than their previous model. I was hoping thr MP 780 would be a better version of the MP 730 but it is not. Someone at Canon made a very poor decision regarding the scanner for the MP 780."
3,Canon PIXMA MP780 All-In-One Photo Printer,"Setup is arduous for a nontechnical person because directions are very general and largely unclear. My setup was basically trial-and-error. There is no phone number (that I could locate) in the manual for Canon help. Printing is slow and does not come close to 25 ppm. Print quality is average, not crisp. The platen has some kind of tape mark on the underside that is not accessible for cleaning. The automatic document feeder is nice. Fax works. Unit was well packaged."
4,"great product, small issue","Product was delivered ahead of schedule.Easy installation. great packaging too.One small problem: can't get it to fax out, but will accept faxes.would like to call Canon to solve problem, but can't find a number anywhere on manual or on-line manual."
4,A great choice for an all-in-one...,"I had owned an Epson all-in-one. Worked great for about a year, then had massive printhead clogging issues. Buy an Epson -- you'll eventually regret it.Got a Pixma MP780. Very happy with it.The build is sufficiently robust. Controls are easy to reach and understand. Print quality of photos is outstanding. Regular text printing is very fast.As the other reviews here have mentioned, you can EASILY AND INEXPENSIVELY REPLACE the printhead. Someday, no matter which printer you're using, you'll have to do this. This Canon makes it very easy. (Epson makes it very expensive)I'm on a Mac running 10.3.8. All software worked as expected. Upgrading to Tiger 10.4 soon; we'll see if it breaks anything/everything."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"I love the scanning feature, I scan all my documents into .pdf format with ease now. Printing quality is awesome. You can print from both feed sources on one print job, so one when one runs out it just switches over to the other one. This allows printing of huge jobs. Great product."
1,Defective Product,"I received my all-in-one and discovered the multipage automatic feeder did not work in either the copy or fax modes. I called Canon and the only solution they offered was to replace the unit with one that had been refurbished. Not exactly what I expected considering I purchased a new one. With this in mind, I would stay away from Canon products."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this printer because I couldn't get a machine that was just a printer without all the bells and whistles that I don't need. It was a canon as was my old S600 workhorse but this is a piece of garbage and a lemon from the start! The paper doesn't feed correctly so half the time it's torn along one edge, it only wants to use about 2/3 of the ink in a cartridge, and the heads clog or misprints half the time, you can print a couple dozen pages before it starts messing up. If you have time to wait until the next day it might be willing to print another couple dozen. I'm going to send the old S600 to get a new print head... it'll be worth the cost."
2,Don't buy this for a network!,"I bought this Pixma for use on a small office network - big mistake. Canon tech support said that they do not provide help for using this model on a network and that it was not designed for use on a network to begin with. Gotcha!My problems began with a MultiPass F80 - a predecessor to the Pixma 780, when I had a paper jam. Needing a multifunction immediately I bought the Pixma directly from Canon. This was in February and the Multipass is still in the shop for repairs.The first Pixma 780 sent by Canon didn't work - a problem with the ribbon carriage. Neither did the second one - same problem. The third one finally worked, but now I found out that it is not supposed to work with small office networks.Buyer beware."
2,"If it won't print, what good is it?","My printing problems began two months after warranty expiration. I tried every troubleshoot I could find, three times. What a beautiful machine. It does everything very well. It even looks great sitting there on the desk. But what if it stops printing, then what good is it? I finally gave up and bought something else."
2,Terrible Print Head!,"I bought my Pixma 780 in July '05. Within 1 yr, the print head failed (black wouldn't print) but it was under warranty and they replaced it. 9 months later, the same problem! Now it's not under warranty and the replacement is $50! It was good while it worked, but 2 failures of the print head in less than 2 years (and I am using canon cartridges too!). Never again. HP or Epson from here on out. Now it serves as a glorified scanner and ""fax machine"" that can't receive because it won't print!"
5,Goodbye HP!,"I have owned HP printers for years - never again. This printer is wonderful. The packaging for shipment is excellent. The installation of the driver is straightforward and simple and the you don't have to install all of the buggy HP software! If you want to keep things simple and install just the drivers, then you can install just the drivers. Installation is simple and the printer is very high quality."
5,The Best,"I have had this printer for about 2 months now. It's by far the best printer I have had. The scans are excellent and it has an auto feeder for documents that I really need, it scans pictures great. I scanned some pictures and printed them and they came out better than the originals.Copier works great and fast. Fax machine is easy to use.I also like the fact that it has two paper feeds.The only drawback is that it is rather large. Other than that it does everything I need and it does it very good. I like it so much I went and bought another Canon all in one for my daughter, I got her the MP500 and it is also an excellent machine but it has no fax."
1,Great while it lasts . . .,"We had our MP780 for about year, and it worked pretty well apart from being a bit of an ink-hog. But the real problem is that it recently just stopped working -- it no longer powers up. It is dark and silent.I checked around and found this is not an uncommon problem with the Pixma series printers. After doing some research I found that all I have to do is take a day off from work, drive 2 hours to a repair shop open only M-F, and pay more for the repair than the printer costs in the first place. Brilliant.Looks like I'm going back to HP for my next printer."
2,Uses color ink for greyscale printing,"Canon printer uses color ink even when printing in grayscale, when it is trying to create a shade of gray. This drastically increases the total cost of ownership of the printer and makes it a much worse by. Even though I printed only a couple color pictures, all my color ink cartridges were eaten up by black and white printing. It is then necessary to replace the color ink cartridges before the print nozzles cease to permanently function. I do not recommend this printer for this reason."
3,PRINT HEAD SUCKS,DOES ALL IT'S SUPPOSE TO DO. HOWEVER 3 PRINT HEADS IN 2 YEARS. I DON'T THINK SO. TIME TO MAKE A CHANGE.
4,Does work in a mixed network,"My kids are having a lot of fun with this thing - I think I'm going to be busting my ink cartridge budget. I was a little nervous after reading previous reviews about networking problems, but it's working perfectly in my mixed network. Scanning, of course, only works on the computer to which it's directly attached. But that's OK for us. We have two Macs and a Windows laptop. The MP780 is attached to one of the Macs, and OS X printer sharing works perfectly for the other. The Windows problem was a little trickier - the secret is to select a PostScript printer driver (Apple Color LaserWriter works) and use IP printing. Only four starts because I haven't had it long enough to warrant five ..."
1,Horrible copier,"MP 780 arrived and when trying to set up, copier print head was unable to align and colors were not printing. Cannon sent replacement printer head but this did not good...same problem. Requested and recieved from Amazon second copier to replace but sure enough same problems occured. Cannon offered to replace but two strikes your out."
3,Slow,"Everything works, but it takes a long time to warm up, and operation is frequently counter-intuitive. Print quality is good, but not outstanding. Overall, it's a good unit if you don't need ease of use."
4,"Sturdy unit, lots of handy details","My only gripe, which may be my own fault, is that it goes through the colored ink when making copies in black mode. When i first received the machine, it took me awhile to figure out every little feature. Then all of a sudden it was out of the yellow and cyan ink. I had been using the plain or fast mode usually. I ended up buying some 3rd party ink cartridges for about $2, and it still seemed to go through the ink quickly. After only a couple of weeks the colored cartridges are empty again. I dont print any pictures or colored prints of any kind. If anyone has any suggestions, feel free to email me at tcalea@hotmail so that i dont agonize over this anymore. Just kidding, but any help is appreciated. As stated, i am using the fast mode and black button. In control panel, i am using grayscale printing, draft mode.T"
1,User Unfriendly,"I have found my Canon Pixma MP780/MP750 to be the mose user unfriendly machine I have ever had. It will copy, and print beautiful, but faxing is another story. The Quick Start Guide isn't any help. I can fax, then later start to fax again and it won't do any thing. The user guide says to adjust the settings for you document as necessary, but even when the document settings have not changed, it won't fax. It is a royal pain. I need help or another machine."
5,canon printer,"So far, so good! Great buy for the price ($200). Perfect for home copying, printing, faxing, etc."
1,DOA?,"This printer seemed to have the best reviews of all the ones we were considering. Needing a printer immediately for a very important deadline, we had this shipped overnight with Amazon Prime. After receiving this printer, we spent about 4 hours installing software and attempting to hook it up. Finally gave in and contacted Canon's customer support, who informed us that the printer was dead on arrival. They would be happy to send us a REFURBISHED printer as a replacement!! My issues with this are:1. A printer that was purchased new should be replaced with brand new.2. What is the long term quality of a printer that is dead straight out of the box?3. This was a big deal for us .... deadlines missed, chaos, etc.Thank you Canon, but NO THANK YOU. We are off to explore HP and Brother laser all in ones."
4,Fax Using VoIP Tip,"I recommend the Canon MP780 provided you can get along with USB and no networking. The product is otherwise well featured and has performs according to specs.If you are faxing using a VoIP line and getting errors using the default settings, set your transmit and receive data rates lower. I use 9600 because its reliable albeit slow.I find the user interface, for any non-simple tasks, to be below average and counter-intuitive. I agree with other posters that sections of the manual are incomplete. The internet needs the ability for users to directly comment and enhance manuals.Wish there was a model with (wireless) networking."
2,never again!,"I purchased this MP 780 Printer in May 2006. 6 Months later the problem began. The only color that the printer was able to print was basically black. All the other colors were barely visible. I contacted Canon and they sent me a replacement print head. I had to wait 3 weeks to receive it instead of the promised 3-4 days because it was on back order. Anyway, it worked fine after that. Now, 2 months later after replacing the print head, the same problem has returned.I bought this printer because it got such good ratings. I will not be buying another Canon Printer again. I have an old HP inkjet printer that I bought in 2000 and have never had a problem with it."
1,Complete printer failure after 14 months,"This printer functioned as advertised for 14 months, used it several times per week for light printing, faxing and scanning. I doubt that it's printed more then 400 pages in total. It stopped printing black and the ink indicators stopped working. Cannon basically said it needs replacing (motherboard replacement). Their ""loyality"" program offers a 20% discount on a new printer. Not quite enough to make me purchase another Canon product. Up until this event I was sold on Canon products, no more."
5,Real shipping time!,"Happy with this product can't wait to get and use it once the weather improves. Its a great way to spend some out door time with you bird. I would suggest buying this flightsuit with Diaper. It takes time to get your bird use to the flightsuit but once he or she realizes that it means going outside and having some fun, he'll be sold."
2,Love the idea But....,If you don't start putting your bird in it young it's very hard to get them in it I really wish it worked for me because i love the Idea
5,Grizzly stainless steel meat grinder,"This thing is built like a tank! I cussed it at first, until I figured out I was putting too large pieces of meat in it. The chunks of meat need to be about 1 1/2"" for the grinder to work well, larger pieces will wrap around auger and not grind. This should last for several lifetimes."
1,lacking data,"There is not enough techincal information about this product, i.e., # cutters, hopper size, etc. to support the price. Why take a chance on something when you don't know what your getting."
2,It's NOT all Stainless Steel,"I bought this grinder, so I will address the size issue, it is plenty big for any home grinding job that you need, no worries there. BUT, BUYER BEWARE, the blade & the chopping plate (the round thing with the little holes that the meat comes out of) are not, I repeat NOT STAINLESS STEEL. And let me tell you, they rust like you wouldn't believe. It's too bad, I was hoping for a grinder that I could just wash & let air dry. This is not the one."
2,order replacement knife at the same time,"The knife (blade) was dull. The rest of the machine probably works great - but since the main function is to grind meat with those blades, it's difficult to tell. Order a ""Stainless Steel knife, #10 grinder"". You might not find this on amazon.The ""C"" part of the clamp is only 1/2 inch deep, if you have a decorative edge on your counter (bullnose etc) greater than that the clamp will not fully catch the counter. Since the clamp only opens to 1 1/2"", you can't put a piece of plywood on your counter and clamp onto plus the counter. The only solution is to get a couple of C-clamps and clamp a piece of plywood overhanging the counter, then clamp the grinder to that.Other than that, it seems very sturdy and well made. You can coat the knife and the grinding plate with mineral oil to prevent rusting (vegetable oil will eventually turn gummy and rancid)."
2,A Real Disappointment,"I read a great deal and have never written a review until now because this book was SO BAD, I had to.I did enjoy the info about supplements, however I am sure if I did a web search I would have found the same material..There is a tremendous amount of repetition and a sense of self-promotion on the part of the author.I have a knowledge of herbs and am using them for perimenopause with great success. I have not found a solution to weight gain and increase of appetite.After several re-reads, this Diet made no sense to me.It seems way too radical and almost impossible to implement..with serving sizes that would keep only a hamster alive.Will put to use several of the pointers and will refer to the diet as a general guideline.Perhaps I need to have a swig of Flax Seed Oil and I won't feel so let down by this book !"
5,A Must-Read For Every Woman Over 40,"This was one of the best books that I have read. Prior to reading this book, I knew my body was feeling different but did not understand some of the symptoms and was not quite sure how I would explain them to a doctor. Well, now I don't need to. I took some of the advice on the Peri-Zapper's and within days I had more energy, my mood was better and I was sleeping like a baby again. I really believe that if I had gone to see a doctor I would have been on various medications which would not have got to the root of my problems."
3,My view of this book won't be popular,"I was a little disappointed in this book. I saw it on Dr Phil and so many of the symptoms are what I've been suffering with. It was going to be my answer I hoped. The Perizappers are a godsend, and some of the information was very helpful. But so much of the book was a primer on nutrition and supplements (which are important, I understand that). I felt like I bought a nutrition book with a few tips on perimenopause, not the other way around, which is what I hoped I was buying.The information on perimenopause is wonderful. While the nutritional advice is sound, I didn't want another diet book, and that's what a good half of this book is about. The other 1/2 is split between the wonders of supplementation and perimenopause. I was hoping for more meat and potatoes about menopause and how to control its symptoms with the various options available to us. Instead, I've got a book with a little bit of that, and a whole lot of just-another-diet-book."
2,"Good Book, But....","I had to downgrade this book from four to two stars because of the author's frequent promotion of particular brands, such as Uni Key. Perhaps it's a pet peeve, perhaps it's just rampant raging hormones, but I've always been driven nuts by that particular practice. I also found the plugs for her other books a bit tedious.Having said that, the information contained in this book jives with what I've read in others about perimenopause - all of which I've purchased in the past several days. (I'd highly recommend ""The Change Before the Change"" by Laura E Corio, MD. It does a much better job of explaining the medical underpinnings of what we're all experiencing.)I have not yet begun the recommended regimine of supplements; it will be interesting to see if what she and others propose actually work."
2,Self Promotion,I could only give this book 2 stars due to the fact that the author just promotes herself continuously either by way of mentioning her books or the supplement company that she obviously owns. It become very tedious constantly reading this self promotion. I also bought Female Brain Gone insane by Mia Lundin which I found much more helpful and less self promotion.
5,THE BEST PERIMENOPAUSE BOOK OUT THERE BY FAR,"I have been suffering from depression and insomnia - which I thought were part of the normal aging process UNTIL I read Ann Louise's book. After taking more magnesium, Vitamin E, and the progestacream she recommends, I am a new person. I have been able to cut down my medications- with my doctor's blessings, by the way- and am starting to lead a much more normal, sane life. I know now, thank's to BEFORE THE CHANGE, that I am a perimenopausal woman and what I have been experiencing are symptoms of this lifestyle change. I wish there were ten stars."
3,Info. basic,"The author really tauts her other books in this one and it is a little offputting. She pushes natural remedies, which is great. However, I wanted more information. At this point, I'm just curious about perimenopause but my symptoms do not require solutions....I want info. This book didn't provide lots."
4,Excellent read for anyone who suspects hormones are an issue,"Finally, a coherent explanation of hormones and their effects. I especially appreciated the holistic remedies and diet advice. After 4 days of following Ms. Gittleman's diet, I feel significantly better with new energy.Although menopause is years away, my diet was creating a rollercoaster of hormone imbalance and the price I have been paying unnecessary. I am looking forward to further improvement and recommend this book highly. If you have low energy maybe it's all the low fat food you are eating! The glycemic indicators on different foods was shocking.In retrospect, it all makes perfect sense. Thank you Ms. Gittleman for an excellent read with pertinent advice."
5,Worth buying just for the peri zappers,"I already feel better after a few days. I'm not thrilled about taking supplements all day long, and so I chose a few here and there from her lists to combat my symptoms. Thank God for natural progesterone! I really liked this book; it helped explain why I was having my symptoms and then told me what to do about them. Others have mentioned that they don't like that she gives references of where to buy her products, but I completely appreciated it because I live in a rural community and we don't have health stores here. Actually I didn't end up buying from her store because I went with a brand that Dr. Northrup recommended in her book, but it is nice to have another resource in case I want to try a different brand, etc."
4,Hormone Therapy Alternatives,"This book not only describes the symptoms of perimenopause, but also tells you what to do for them. Louise Gittleman has done a fantastic job. Many of the symptoms she talks about, I wasn't even aware were part of perimenopause; I just thought there was something wrong with me. I only wish I had read the book years ago! I was determined not to undergo hormone therapy, and just when I was ready to re-consider, I read ""Before the Change"". What a lifesaver it has been. Her suggestions have made my life so much easier!!"
5,You will refer to this book for years,"I bought the first edition of this book after seeing Ann Louise on Dr. Phil. It was exactly the time I experienced my first overt symptom of perimenopause; however, I learned that I had been experiencing the symptoms of lowering progesterone levels for at least five years. SO many things were explained! Since I bought the book, I have referred to it several times when confronted with additional perimenopause symptoms and have implemented Ann Louise's recommendations. No, not every perimenopause symptom hits at once--it's a lengthy progression and every woman seems to be different. No, you're not going crazy--read the book."
3,good and bad,"The advice on taking Magnesium, flaxseed oil, and other supplements is great. But the diet recommended is too high in protein. It gave me a mean stomachache every time I ate that wouldn't go away for months. A natural healer said it was from buildup in my stomach caused by protein and it was only after eating a diet with a lot of raw veggies and an apple a day that I got better. It's true you should cut back on carbs and definitely cut out sugar. But you don't need to eat this much protein. Eat a lot of veggies with oil on them, and a small amount of protein with each meal, plus a small amount of carbs and you will feel much better!"
4,Right time - right information,"I'm a 38 year old, who has been fighting panic attacks and weight gain, as well as other ""stress related"" issues. I've gone to the doctor, joined a Curves and followed the best advice I could find. But this book was able to point out what I've missed in my diet and exercise. It makes sense and she provides plenty of documentation for her findings. I started taking a few supplements and adjusting my diet and with in two weeks my anxiety was WAY down and my skin was improving! I'm not gaining weight even though I've increased my calories (and FAT intake) and I'm finally feeling full and happy with my meals. I'll know more in a few months but so far it's been fantastic advice.I didn't think this would apply to me because my family history points to a late menopause but seeing is believing, and I'm hooked!Give it a try - it's basically the SouthBeach diet with some extra twists to help balance the hormones - I'm very thankful I gave this book shot."
4,"good watch, soft crystal, no date",You get what you get with a Swatch. It is very light weight and easy to wear. I have had this watch for 7 months and it is still keeping very good time. Only negative is that watch face is VERY scratched up and not having a date drives me a little bonky. Overall is a good looking watch at a great price.
5,Sport of Queens,"This book was reasonably priced, shipped quickly and in good condition. Very pleased with this purchase!"
3,Beginning Great!...Ending Blah!,"I have read 2 books by this author and with both books, the beginning of the books are great then the endings seem rushed. I really enjoyed this book. There was so much detail about the women and how they were wronged. I thought the revenge would be just as detailed. Other than that I really like her writing style and will try a couple more of her books."
4,A page turning classic!,"One of the best! A real page turning classic that stands up to the test of time, and one you wil want to read over and over again."
1,Never thought of doing THAT with a goldfish!,This book is utter trash. Not worth your time or money. Stick with Judith Krantz for the sublimely sexy trash!
1,Boring,"I lost interest in this book, I couldn't get into the other characters besides Lili. There wasn't enough suspense or action or anything else. I didn't care for the author's sytle of writing."
2,Still reading after 3 weeks,I usually finish reading a book in 1-3 days sometimes hours. I am still reading this one. Actually i stopped and moved on and i have read quite a few since then but i cannot bring myself to go back to it. The book started great Book 1 was good. It was book 2 that dragged. To be honest i will probaly finish it because i do want to know how it ends. Who was pregnant? What happened to all the girls? etc. By the way the love scenes in the first part of the book was boring!!!!!
1,not what i expected,"I had the chance to order this book from two local book stores, with an estimated delivery time of 5 days. However, I decided to order this book from jandj_books through Amazon.com with the belief that I would be able to get this book sooner. This was not the case. In fact I NEVER received this book at all, although they gladly accepted my payment for this book. I have sent emails to both jandj_books and also customer service at Amazon.com and have NOT received anything at all pertaining to the reason for this incident or of any steps that are being taken to correct it. I would not recommend Amazon.com for ordering anything and especialy would not recommend ordering anything through jandj_books."
3,"good in a Judith Krantz, trashy-yet-well-written kind of way","This is good in a Judith Krantz, trashy-yet-well-written kind of way. Contains unfortunate depictions of Arab culture, yet the book rarely raises issues of inter-racial couples, despite its prevalence.This has a completely implausible plot--four girls meet while together at boarding school in Sweden, have a lot of sex with inappropriate men, one of them winds up having a kid and putting it up for adoption. Then they marry rich, famous, and powerful men from a variety of cultures. The kid winds up having a horrible early life, but manages to rise from making porn movies in France to being an international movie star. Early on in the book, she confronts the four old friends and asks them, ""Which one of you bitches is my mother?""It just gets better from there...."
4,Great fun,"I was long a fan of the TV movie, but having now read the book I can say it is quite a bit better than the movie. It is quite a fun book which takes place on an international stage, just like the movie. France, Greece, Switzerland, New York, and the imaginary middle eastern country of Sydon. The story is fabulously over the top and weighs in at 740 pages, so you really get to know the characters. They are quite likeable and the story is dramatic and fun at the same time. Ritzy, glitzy, trashy and glamorous; this book is great fun and great escapism."
5,sheath,I buy these sheaths every couple of months because I have the knife in and out of the sheath 100 times a day and I just plain were it out (the Velcro) so I know the drill and am happy with the service and price. 5 stars
4,Just okay multi tool,It was good tool while I had it. I've lost it somewhere in my yard...(drat)... It was way too expensive for the fit & finish. Cheaper and better ones are available. If I find I will let you know how it held up. I didn't like the mat/ coarse finis. Beware the knife is ginsu sharp.
4,Good Leatherman,"All in all a handy tool. Nice and compact. It definitely suits my needs, but next time I might opt for a more traditional Leatherman. This one doesn't have all of the features the traditional one has."
3,decent quality - over priced,"Needed these to go with Leathermen we were giving as gifts after a class I teach. The sheaths were almost as much as the Leathermen, so not really very good value."
4,Great carry,"very few things are more annoying than not having a multitool when you need it, one of those things is having a bloody bruise on you thigh because you have the multitool in your pocket where it bangs around (Depending on the depth of your pocket and bagginess of your pants it may bang against other anatomical parts but i have no personal experience on THAT!) so one great way to keep it securely where you want it and easily access while NOT tenderizing your thigh for the inevitable grizzly attack is to use this great little pouch, it holds your multitool securely on your belt and away from you anatomy."
5,What a wonderful book!,"Yes, what a wonderful book! The true epic of the Second World War on the Eastern Front with vivid descriptions of the battles as well as political and social events that brought them about.Wrong are those who called this book ""a history for Russophiles"". This book can only be called pro-Russian if you think of Russia from a Hollywood perspective (i.e. evil empire :-) ). The author constantly uses numerous historical sources from all sides involved in the conflict. Mr. Werth describes all the blunders of Stalin's regime without making it look stupid. But the most important fact is that this book is what the author saw with his own eyes being a British correspondent on the front.Amazing book that describes truly heroic struggle of one country that saved the world from Nazism and Fashism."
3,A book from a witness of the World War II.,"I read both volums of this book, in a tranlation to the portuguese, here in Brazil.Hundreds of pages, all writen for a man who live and saw the facts.Alexander Werth saw the war.He was there.This wasn't writen, by a scholar living today.Alexarder Werth was a russophile?Yes, but we must realize that Russia was the nation who defeat both Hitler and Napoleon.Hitler lost about 7 millions militaries, form Soviet Union, against less than 2 millions from all more than 20 armies others togheter.The World War II in Europe was decided by Soviet Union.Not that I'm not a communist.In fact I'm a deeply anti-comunist, unemployed agronomist and brazilian.There are problems with this book?Yes, it has no new discoveries from former Soviet Union files.And it's very long.I still have both volums of this book."
4,Journalistic account,"This is a pretty good book on the eastern front, but it has some flaws. He relies too heavily on Soviet sources, which he quotes at length. I think he can be called an apologist for Stalin in a few places. The maps are not very detailed and there are no photos.But the book has some real strengths too. The overall campaign comes through clearly, the sense of the scope and harshness of the war is well drawn, and there are a lots of revealing anecdotes.I would describe this as a journalistic account not a full scale history. But it is a good read."
4,Quality cable raceway,"I bought this cable raceway specifically to hide a bundle of speaker cable running to an A/V receiver plus a coaxial line. It does the job very well overall. It's solidly designed and attractively mounted to white baseboard molding. I was able to house four 16-gauge 2-wire speaker wire lines plus one coax cable in the raceway. This was the max. Anything more and you cannot keep the raceway snapped together. The tension on the snap could stand to be a bit stronger. This, plus the relatively high price is the only reason I cannot give it 5 stars. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this raceway to anyone looking for a higher capacity cable raceway."
3,"Ok, but tastes terrible.","Make sure you do all the tongue action before you get to the regular kind of occurances, there is no opportunity to go back to the former after the latter without getting this goo on your tastebuds, and that is something you will not thank yourself for.Tastes like liquidized plastic hats."
2,ok but stains,"yep, it does the job but it is runny, which=messy, and IT STAINS SHEETS. PERMANENTLY. i decided to dye the white sheets one day and now you can really tell all the lube stains are a different color than the rest of the sheets. pretty horrifying, and it's all astroglide b/c that's the only thing we've used in years. yes, i had bleached them, used oxyclean, etc... stains still there.buy something else, there have to be some lubricants out there that aren't so runny and don't stain."
5,Works good,My girlfriend loves this stuff. It's a little wet but not thick. Works good for its price.
4,A great follow up to first album,"Very similar to their self titled release. I'd be surprised if these songs weren't written and recorded amongst the first album. Lots of fun! Jim is a very talented Tele player and Joe Goldmark on the pedal steel is the perfect complement. This is the pedal steel sound of the 90's! Kinda like Brian Setzer meets Speedy West. Come on, Pee Wee's Big Adventure on the steel??? Did I say fun? Buy it."
2,WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT,"After the comparisons to the HELLECASTERS I could hardly wait to get my hands on this CD. To compare JIM to the HELLECASTERS is an insult to the HELLECASTERS. If you can buy DANNY GATTON, THE HELLECASTERS, SCOTTY ANDERSON or JOHNNY A, than why would you buy this??? At his best JIM sounds like a two fingered DANNY GATTON on valium. He doesn't have the licks, style or class of the abovementioned guitarists. His playing always sounds limited by a severe lack of technique. His tone is nothing special either and none of his compositions would make it onto either a GATTON ,JOHNNY A or HELLECASTER CD. His solos for the most part rarely lift above noodling of the worst order.He doesn't even noodle very well. My better half screams in protest from the other room ""TAKE THAT NOISE OFF"". Normally I'd argue with her but here her assessment is spot on, THIS IS NOISE."
3,It's not terrible...,"Ms.Birkin never looked better. Even though she plays the main character, she does not have heavy duty acting job here ... and that's a good thing. :)The English dialog version have terrible audio quality. Every now and then Italian version pops out and it's much clearer. The video quality is not the best, but definitely good enough. I don't think improvement there would help much. What we have here is a middling effort by the director and writer. Competent enough, but nothing really shines. Not even the blades."
2,Sub IS better...but....,"There is a maturity in ""subbing"" that raped for kids shows can never offer in dub becuse they are dubed edit frsit, however yugioh is a niche show so liking it can be hard if you don't ""get it"" or don't want to.However its 4kids same abusive tactics I wont even put up with normal DVDs because they do not respect the medium I say do what it takes to own anything they make on the ""cheap"".Altho..I would strangely buy Fighting Food ons dub only if it were available on DVD that was the last show 4kids handled where they did not rape the product.BTW Disney get off yer bum and release Pizza cats on DVD already..."
3,American or Japanese what's the difference!?!,I only recommend this series for older Yu Gi Oh! Fans. If you hate this series anyway the Japanese uncut version will not impress you in the least. This statement only holds water if you already like or are somewhat interested in the storyline.Don't buy this DVD unless you already like or are interested Yu Gi Oh!Ignore otaku sentiment about the Japanese version being better unless you're a fan.
1,Doesn't seem to work properly,"Unlike the original imaging film, we had nothing but trouble with this roll - it doesn't seem to be made to the same specifications and bunches up on every other fax/copy."
5,Hard to find item,"The film is just what I needed! It is not very easy to find in the stores, so Amazon came through for me!"
4,Faxfilm,Product works as stated just fine. Copies are sharp and clear. Very good value for the price. Fast ship also.
4,Fax film,"Living is a small town it not easy to remember you need an item until you go to use it by using amazon I was able to purchase it without spend drive time, and time searching time. It was very convient and easy to get and install."
4,"Strange tales, fun reading","I enjoyed this book. Interesting oddities about the Buckeye state. If there were a second volume, I'd buy it too!"
4,Best One-Volume Resource For Engineers,"If you are an engineer engaged in the design of mechanical and electrical systems for commercial and institutional buildings, you may find this your most valuable reference for an overview of theory and best practices for the entire gamut of building systems.I did find a bit too much enthusiasm for environmentally friendly and energy-conserving new ideas. Many of these technologies are worth following but have economic results that will not serve your clients well.I am a professional engineer (leading my own firm) with 40 years of experience and have a huge library including the eighth and ninth editions of this book; it's one of my favorites.It's must reading for a new engineer because you will be able to understand the basics of areas that are new to you with an hour or two of study."
2,Rip-off,"This item is a 1-1/2 page review of 2 books, Antony Black's and another by Viroli. Only 3/4 of the first page is devoted to the review of Antony Black's book, and while it is a good, concise review, it is absolutely not worth paying $5.95 when reviews can be found for free on the Internet."
1,MADE TO BREAK,"I bought these for my girlfriend for Christmas and in the last 6 months (or less) 3 have broken. ALL WHILE SHE WAS WASHING THEM! She cut herself the first 2 times, the 3rd just broke right now as she was doing the dishes, and thank god, she didn't cut herself THESE ARE THE WORST QUALITY WINE GLASSES YOU CAN BUY!!! THEY'RE MADE OF ****!!! There's no reason why a woman who weighs no more than 100 lbs and is more fragile than the glasses themselves should be able to break them while hand washing with a soft sponge. BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY AND THE COMPANY IS LUCKY WE DON'T SLAP THEM WITH A LAWSUIT AFTER THEY'VE CUT HER THE FIRST TWO TIMES!DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!!!!"
3,Veggie Tales,"Doesn't quite hold their attention like some of the other dvd's out there, but has great stories with good life lessons!"
4,I new face in the crowd.,A new face in the world of singer/songwriters. I see a little Jeff Buckley and David Gray in his style. A good album.
3,Refuse ToChoose,"The topic is worth reading about, but I thought that the author took a long time getting to the salient points."
3,Condensed version please,"I'm about half-way through the book. Most of the suggestions in this book are good and that's why I recommend it. But it's so full of self praise about her other books, full conversations she's had with people including descriptions of their facial expressions, and descriptions of the actions of a room full of people at her conferences that I find it extremely hard to muddle through. I skim and skim looking for the next great suggestion. If the book listed just the facts and advice I think it would be about ten pages long."
5,We Are Not Alone!,"Barbara has given clarity to what I once thought was a deficit! Spread the word that Scanners are not only valuable, We are IN!!! This book will bring relief to your weary soul, and provide the guidance needed to unravel the misconceptions that surround the highly intelligent, creative, multi-passionate, world rocking People We are!!!"
3,It reads somewhat like an infomercial,"I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. Turned page after page feeling sure we'd get to the big point any minute now. The only part that really engaged me was when we got to serial specialists and masters. To be fair, that's probably because I am one of those, an the rest bored me because I am a scanner LOL. It is good to know that there is a category for someone like me. Now at least I know there are others!"
5,I'm a Scanner,"There isn't any question that I am a scanner. Nothing else explains the wide range of interests, few of which have anything to do with one another.I've read this book before an I even came across notes that I wrote when I read it. I've used some of the techniques and some of the principles, and they work. This time I spent a lot more time digging deeply into the book, so I got even more out of it.Recommended (if you are a scanner or need to understand one). Worth the time."
2,Let down,"This must have been a re-recording when they were much older. Same songs, same singers (maybe) but nowhere near as good as my vinyl record."
1,not original recordings,on these cds you cannot play short excerpts from the songs.this is how i can tell the quality of a cd. i just purchased 2 frankie valli and the four seasons cds and they are excellant remasters of the otiginal songs.
5,The First Leatherman in Alaska,"I bought my first Leatherman in 1987, and received a second this Christmas. When the only tools you have are those on your person, a stainless steel Leatherman multi-tool is hard to beat. It will not substitute for heavier tools in a standard work environment, but my first tool still looks good after a number of years working in the saltwater environs of coastal Alaska. As many will tell you, in a survival situation, most often the only tools for survival are those attached to your body. As such, the habit of packing a PST on my belt provides a bit of comfort in venturing forth."
4,Happiness,"First, the downsides: It's not a thing of beauty. The controls are comprehensible, but they could be so, so much better. The cycling of the modes may very well wake you up. And the capacity is disappointing.And the upside: It humidifies. It doesn't leak. And there are no consumables. In the world of humidifiers, you're lucky to get 1 of 3, much less all of them.One thing I was confused about when I bought this was *how* it humidified. Well, basically it's a pot of boiling water. Thus the need to periodically run through a cycle with citric acid to get rid of deposits. But yay: no consumables!"
5,Ordering another one today,Best humidifier I have owned. I haven't owned a lot of them - but all the ones I have purchased besides this one have been poor products.
3,So far so good,"I bought this item two weeks ago and it's been working good. The mode switches automatically based on the humidity of the room. If it's on automatic, it wouldn't last for 12 hours12/5/2010:I had to change the rating to 3 stars because the item stopped working after a year! I did not expect such an expensive item and reputable brand name would die this soon."
2,352 Pages of Crap!!!!,I normally read a book a week; sometimes two; but it has taken me at least 4 weeks to wade through this maze of mess. I have read all of Colin Channer's books and was extremely disappointed in the style that he wove this tale. I enjoy the Island theme in all his books it is usually very educational and romantic; but this format was aggravating and annoying!!!! I will think twice about reading anything else he writes if this is going to be his new way of telling a story....
4,Passing Through,"This is the first of Colin Channer's book that I've read but it certainly won't be the last.Weaving delicious tales together to form an intricate tapestry, the reader is transported to San Carlos and captivated by its beauty. Skillful character development and the richness of his language keep you page turning. I didn't want it to end... I didn't want to leave... But as he reminds us on the last page - we're all just passing through."
5,Channer does it again!!!,"In true Colin Channer fashion, he strikes gold again with passing through. As if Waiting in Vain and Staisfy my soul were not intriguing enough he took us ""there"" again with Passing through.I always knew he had a vivid imagination and a way with words but his character references and character ""realness"" made me feel like I was right there with Estrella on her journey.... I want to learn Sancoche!!! I want her Moxie!!!Thanks Colin for bring us adventure after adventure.Gwaan wid iit!!!!"
5,Wonderful!,"I have always enjoyed Colin Channer's writing. He manages to make you feel as if you are right on an island with him, taking a peek into someone else's life, instead of your own day to day lifestyle. Passing Through is a sexy history lesson. A history lesson that I wish I could have read back in high school. I would have passed that class with flying colors! Mr. Channer, thank you for another awesome novel!"
2,ok book but very outdated,"As the author of 3 mass market books on cancer and health, I can say that Fink's 1997 book was very useful up until about 3 years ago. However, the information contained in it is now very outdated, due in part, to the rapidly changing landscape of alternative cancer treatments and practitioners in the US and abroad. Also, a number of so called 'alternative health-practitioners' do operate at less-than scrupulous levels, and tend to pack up and leave town for greener pastures from time to time. [By the way, anyone considering an alternative therapy should always ask the therapist for records and clinical data in support of their therapy; the one's who don't provide such should be suspect, and often, it's these folks who don't seem to be in business for very long durations.] Overall, Fink's book is a fairly decent introduction to alternative therapies---however overly optimistic the tone is from time to time. However, don't blindly accept the information for its accuracy."
5,BLOWS AWAY MICRODRIVES IN SPEED DEPARTMENT,"These lexar 40x & 80x CF cards are great storage cards for devices that need high speed read/write capability.Note: Microdrives are nice for MP3's players or low end pocket PCs but they are terrible options for cameras because the read and write speeds are too slow for quick shooting.So when you need to take quick pictures or get information off the drive fast (streaming video . . .etc.) These Lexars and the SanDisk ULTRA II (my personal favorite) are the only ones I would recommend, and I do so highly."
4,Compatibility with all cameras,"On their website Lexar guarantees that all of their compact flash cards are compatible with your digital camera, period. Contact them"
5,Great movie about my homeland. Yes.,"I definitely recommend this video to anyone who is considering vacationing in china, my homeland. Watch ""Touring China"" and you'll know which attractions to see (the Great Wall), and which to avoid (the subway in Taiyuan has rats as big as cats).You will also learn where to get acupuncture treatment as well as the location of the best noodle bar in Peking (now known as Beijing). Did you know that the Han Dynasty used to celebrate the Dragon on the 3rd day of every month?The video is a ""must have"" flick for the educated person who wants to learn more about China."
5,Great book!!,This is a gread read told from a young boys view on the pirates that roamed New England's waters. If you like action and sea fights this book is for you.
4,Best waffle maker I've ever used.,"I always hated making waffles as a kid, you never knew when they were done...and then they stuck! This is a joy to use! Makes the best waffles, crisp on the outside, tender inside...every one done to perfection. Will be making waffles every weekend now!"
1,Uneven Waffles from a top priced iron,It appears as though they put a round heating element in this square waffler. The corners are always white. Not much use for the temp sensor as I have to set it all way to the max to get golden brown waffles--Far below expectations for a unit of this price. I guess I'll go back to my 30 year old Made in the USA unit; its a little slower but the waffles come out great. I want to send this one back to China. The last complaint is more of a nuisance than a problem - It will stand on end but is rather unsafe as there is no latch and the lid crashes down if not secured.
2,"Tried it, and returned it","This was my second waffle iron, first one a different brand. I did not like this one, it has a ""waffle tone"" that sounds like the smoke alarm going off, it went off when it preheated, when the waffle was ready, when the waffle iron cooled a little and reheated, it went off way too often. Made all of us nervous. Waffle quality did not come out great, either. Disappointed, still looking for a belgian waffle iron instead. But will definetly not buy one with that awful waffle tone."
2,Not As Good As It Seems,"I bought this waffle iron for my husband as a gift, and I must say it was disappointing on Sunday morning, after reading through the manual, washing it, preparing batter, etc, and eagerly anticipating a waffle breakfast for the family - to find that the waffles were unevenly cooked, flat in some parts, risen/puffy on others, mostly burnt in the middle. I decided to check online for reviews and apparently others have had the same experience. We won't be keeping it for a second run. Not worth the bucks we paid at a well known kitchen retail store. We plan to go back to the $30-$50 range and look for a more reliable inexpensive model."
4,VillaWare V2001C UNO Clasic Waffler 4-square,"Once the heat control is adjusted and waffle maker is warmed up, it works great! No problems with this product."
1,Waste of money!,"I purchased this waffle maker to replace a cheap single maker. I mistakenly thought that by buying a more expensive model I would get better waffles. It only cooks on one side and no matter which recipe I use they're flat. I wish I could return this item, but I waited too long thinking I could find the right recipe. We use to have waffles every Sunday, we've switched pancakes."
2,"good for history, not nearly as good for making the stuff","I had wanted this book for quite a while, finally got it and was dismayed to see how little actual brewing information I got. The first half of the book seems to consist primarily of a history of Root Beer followed by 15-16 pages of recipes (short, limited in detail)many of which are only vaguely related to the subject. The book also has lists of books, supply outlets and internet sources (this may be the best part of the book)and a few other soft drink subjects. If you really want to make your own root beer or soda pop I'd say buy Stephen Cresswell's Homemade root beer and soad pop instead, I liked it much better."
4,good summary book for root beer collectibles,"this is a good book for the beginner and experienced collector of root beer collectibles, as well as for those who just love root beer or other sodas and other soft drinks."
4,Excellent introduction to differential geometry,"I found this book to be a good introduction to differential geometry for undergraduates. All concepts are clearly and concisely developed and explained well. Also, the details of advanced calculus and analysis required for the book are covered very well in appendices. My only reservation is that the problems can be very difficult at first. For someone interested in really exploring and learning differential geometry, however, this is not a problem."
5,A great introduction and surely a classic !!!,"Manfredo is a great teacher and a great geometer. In this book he follows Einstein's criteria ""things must be presented in its simplest form, but not any simpler than that"". It has great explanations and beautiful demonstrations. If you love math and geometry, buy it now!"
2,"Good content, cheaply manufactured","The content is well-presented and instructive. My main gripe with this book is the very low quality paperback edition. After just a month of (careful) reading, many pages already falling out. The cover and content look as if they have been scanned and re-printed.Update: by the end of the semester, my copy has now completely fallen apart. I wish this hadn't been manufactured so cheaply."
3,book cover not too good; otherwise great.,The printing of the cover is not as clear as normal books. Some scratches on corners.I like it otherwise.
3,The book is Fine but not detailed enough,"To be honest, the topics contained in this book are interesting and useful. But, I believe that a beginner in learning Differential Geometry should at least understand some basic principles before reading this book. It will help you to extend your view only if you are well prepared."
3,A good introductory book on Differential Geometry,"I used this book to study for the geometry qualifying exam at UC Santa Barbara for Masters and Ph.D. students. I found it easily accesible, concise, and self-contained."
1,Outdated classic in the field,"While many consider this text the classic in the field, I think that it's time to find something a bit more modern. do Carmo often skips steps in his proofs or examples that he deems ""obvious"" but that my professor even had to spend a good deal of time trying to figure out how to bridge the gap. The writing style and terminology are beginning to show their age, and the exercises are particularly incomprehensible. Also, the few examples that are actually included don't give any insight into doing the exercises, which seem to be written primarily as a way for do Carmo to include topics that he couldn't squeeze into the body of the text. The hints in the back of the book are often too vague to provide any useful insight into solving the problem, especially for someone not familiar with geometry. Hope that you don't have to use this text for a first course in differential geometry, and if you do, hope that the professor writes his/her own exercises."
2,engineers should get another book,"If you are a mathematician this book probably suits your purposes, BUT if you are an engineer (interested in shell structures for instance) I would recommend ""Elementary Differential Geometry"" by Pressley.This book focuses on many sub-topics that are not of interest to an engineer and many of the exercises are abstract and of very little practical value. Also ""Elementary Differential Geometry"" focuses more on real 3-D shapes and their properties, and thus it is more readable."
3,too wordy,"Many people say that this is an excellent book on elementary Differential Geometry,so I borrowed one.I read most of chapter1-4,but I do not find it clear enough.Maybe I have been confused by so many examples.It is too wordy for me.It can be more concise.I recommend the book of Klingenberg,which is used as my textbook.Klingenberg'book is a little dense and does not contain enough exercises.But your professor will give you some."
1,Avoid the Headache,"No matter the cost, this unit is horrible. Sounds ok while it works but CD player stops working and sending it in for repair did not help. Unit came back still broken and the face plate was damaged. Will never buy anything made by this company again."
4,Leicester Bangs Review (2007):,"Joey Wright - Jalopy (Black Hen)A busy full-time musician, Joey Wright plays guitar and mandolin with Sarah Harmer, co-writes and plays with his wife, Jenny Whiteley, and when he wants to give his fingers a proper workout, he turns out with Toronto bluegrass legends, Crazy Strings. Then he does his own thing, in this case a 12 track collection of beautifully executed acoustic instrumentals.The 11 originals and 1 cover (Duke Ellington's ""Come Sunday"") hop sprightly between genres, from Hawaiin luau, via Gypsy wagon to packporch mountain home. Jalopy is not only an Americana record, in its broadest sense, but it connects the dots with plenty of Old World influences picked up along the way. And you know what they say about variety..."
2,Not A Great Product,"I have the Inter-Bake 3 for approximately one year. Because I live in an apartment I thought that this item would be perfect for me as space is limited and would serve as 3 appliances. I have used the pizzelle and waffle functions and have been less that pleased. Using the recipes included I found that baking took much longer than the recommended time to achive a nicely browned item. Also, the baked product was not light or crisp. The waffels were dense and the pizzelles were thick and had more of a cakelike bite rather than a thin, crisp cookie. The Inter-Baker was very easy to clean as stated in the instructions and if the the grids were coated with shorting as suggested nothing stuck to them. All in all not a great experience."
4,Just shy of 5 stars,"I would have given this 5 stars if it did a little better with waffles, they turn out lighter on the top side. It does a great job with pizzelles and toasted sandwiches. The removable plates are a huge asset it makes cleaning up so easy! All in all I am quite happy with the multibaker."
4,Villaware three in one,"The different plates are a little hard to change, but easy to clean and very nice to use. Makes wonderful pizzelles."
4,"Great concept, but be careful...","I love the way you can change the plates in the waffle iron to make cookies and sandwiches. The removable plates are also great for cleanup! However, be very careful and read the directions before removing the plates for the first time. I didn't read the directions carefully and ended up breaking the inside of the handle. Once you break that, it's all downhill from there. The company sells replacements, but not the replacement piece for the handle that locks the it. Now, my waffle iron will not stay shut. I have no alternative, but to buy a new one."
1,waffle iron not so hot,"I bought this waffle maker because it has removable plates, so it is easier to clean than a traditional one. However, it does not get very hot and takes up to 10 minutes to make a waffle! So, if you have a family of four, it takes 40 minutes to make breakfast, AND THE FIRST WAFFLES ARE COLD WHEN THE LAST ARE DONE. If I had bought this product from a store in my community, I would surely retun it, the fact that I have to hassle with the mail is the only reason i still own it."
2,waffles take too long,"This doesn't get hot enough. Waffles take so long to cook (at least 10 minutes, maybe longer) that you sit around waiting and waiting and waiting for everyone's waffles to be done. I'd give it a one star but it does work."
5,A thoughtful and practical resource for educators,"Fostering Resiliency: Expecting All Students to Use Their Minds and Hearts Well, is a well written and easy to read resource for teachers and administrators. Martin Krovetz provides concrete examples of schools which have developed into resilient learning communities for both students and staff. It will leave you with a deeper understanding of what a ""good school"" does and hopefully, the inspiration to take on the work of making your school a more resilient community."
5,Easy applicable to schools you know well,"As the author, I hope that you will find Fostering Resiliency to be the book for l999 that makes you reflect deeply on the public schools you know well and that helps you ask why the schools in your neighborhood are not more like the seven schools described in this book."
3,Fostering Resiliency,The basic premise is that high expectations and setting rules allows children to experience challenge and succeed beyond their dreams. This encouragement must be strong and across the board.
4,Good Labor Law Book,"If you want to get a basic grasp of labor law under the Wagner Act or NLRA, this book is for you."
3,a small deceipt,"He wrote a good book on small histories of his war. But no many on aerial war ! it's curious, i like his writing but why he doesn't speak of these planes or comrade ( gunther rall, 5 sentences, we don't know about of his first victory, etc...). Curious !"
2,Great strategy... if it worked,"This was a very interesting book. I enjoyed it immensely. Unfortunately, the Trinity Trading System doesn't work. Since I'm a software developer, I created a database and program to automatically alert me to ALL stocks that fit Mrkvicka's strategy, and I've been monitoring it. It just doesn't work. The losers far outnumber the winners, and the winners have not been stellar. Anyone can sell a book that has a ""sure-fire system,"" but in the end Mrkvicka provides only anecdotal evidence to back up the system. If you want an example of a statistically sound book, check out O'Shaughnessy's What Works On Wall Street or Siegel's Stocks for the Long Run. If Mrkvicka really believes in his system, he will publish valid data to prove it, not just list a few winners."
2,Scenic Driving Virginia,On the front of this book it clearly states 'With Color Photographs by Jeff Greenburg'. Don't be misled. ALL the photos in the book are black and white and of poor quality.Very disappointed.
1,No reggae,"The Pericos did this CD without Bayano (before singer) and really there are not any reggae or ska here, so for me the CD is extremely bad."
2,Inaccurate reading,"I Have been in the Computer and Internet field for over 10 years, owning no less than 3 domains for over 5 years, and working in a MAJOR NOC for over 8 years, I know a bit about E-Commerce.The author of this book seems to have lived in some other world, as he does NOT seem acquainted with Internet terminologies much at all! He seems to make up his own terms and definitions for MANY areas and create his own words for these definitions.Where SOME of the information is good and presented well, much is WAY off. Not really a good book in my mind for a beginner, as they would be lost in an attempt to use the information in the REAL world of Internet.My advise, try another book first. His real goal seems not to educate readers on Proper Internet, but to assist in promoting the publishers other books.Save your money!"
1,don't buy,"I have had this product for a couple of years. The spout started to melt. I made coffee yesterday morning and when I went to pour it, the top separated from the bottom spilling hot coffee all over. Lucky thing I wasn't scalded. Not a very safe product."
2,One song - nine versions,"Song is okay but not a hit. This single gives you the original mix at three and a half minutes, then eight longer length versions (seven minutes of the Slammmin' Chris Cox Mix). Only for die hard fans of Summer or Moroder."
3,Nothing too exciting..,A quick read with plenty of decent points but nothing that you wont find elsewhere. If youve read plenty of business books skipping this one wont hurt you. If you havent read many then this is a not bad easy read.
2,It's for beginners.,"I bought this book to brush up Listening and Structure Comprehenshions. Even if I had many problems with listeing, I could get perfect scores in Listening Section. I suppose this book is too easy for students who aim at more than 550. Not only did I wasted time, but my score was not improved."
1,DO not buy the kindle version,The kindle version is a waste of money as you can't hear the listening questions. Awful. Why do they sell a kindle version?
2,Practice Exercises for the TOEFL,it was not shiped on time. It was very late to read it for the exam
1,Pass on this item...,"I began making my own sausage at home and bought this to save time stuffing it into casings. This stuffer was difficult to use and more sausage would come out of the top than into the casings. I have since moved on and purchased something much more expensive, but worth every penny. I enjoy making sausage now that the hard work of ""stuffing"" is easy. My advice is spend the money for something that works."
1,Opened cards!!!,I am terribly unhappy with my recent purchase. I bought a pack of Pokemon Jungle Japanese Booster cards for a Christmas present. I couldn't believe that the pack of cards were opened and had tape all over the pack. There is no way I can give this as a gift now. Now I am stuck with a pack of useless cards and I am out $8.00. It apears that the seller opened the cards and could have taken out good ones and left me with all common cards.
5,"A new, young star","Cassandra Lynn writes a novel so vivid, you can easily picture the setting and the characters in your mind's eye. She is a pleasure to read. This book reminds me of the Lord of the Rings. A very detailed, magical world with realistic characters. A good story."
2,Disappointed,"I waited a long time to read this book, therefore I was very disappointed with the outcome. Pages of name dropping and casual references to animals and tribes. There was no meat or thread of interest to carry the reader through this literal journey. Compared to his other books this was a bomb."
2,eh,"I thought these would be reusable and easy to clean. They weren't. They were sturdier, but had the same difficulty reusing them as the ones sold in Target. Not worth the price."
4,it's a good thing,This is a beautiful book that I have purchased many times for gifts.Beautifully illustrated and very meaningful. The 15 minutes that it takes to get through it makes it a weekly read to put everything in your life into perspective. It takes away the day to day drama and helps us all appreciate everything and everyone around us. It's a good thing that I cannot do without.
5,heart changing,I HAD TO GET THIS BOOK THE FIRST TIME I HEARD SOMEONE RECITE ONE PRAYER. I SEND OUT PRAYERS TO ALL THAT ARE SUFFERING AND TO ALL THAT CAUSE THE SUFFERING (NOT EASY THIS BOOK IS HELPING MY ON MY JOURNEY! I ALWAYS HAVE GOOD LUCK WHEN ORDERING FROM AMAZON.COM.
1,Little substance,"Beautiful design, but little substance. The prayers seemed to be aimed at self-motivation, and not necessarily at seeking communication with God. I would instead recommend ""The Prayers of Kierkegaard"" for a deliberative, thought provoking, and moving set of prayers."
3,Peters & Lee,"This CD is a Greatist Hits version of Peters & Lee. It has some of their early work (i.e 70's) and some of the later work (i.e. 80's). I have been looking for this CD for awhile. If you are not familiar with Peters & Lee, they are a British duo that was popular in the UK in the 70's. I would compare them to the American group Peter, Paul and Mary or the Carpenters (with a male lead). This is slow, relaxing music that is great for time spent alone."
3,NIce but beware.........,"I purchased this table and was so excited for my kids to use it. I had heard great things about this company and felt I would be getting a durable, well-made product. As I was getting it ready to set up, I felt something on the top of the table. I got a semi-wet (barely wet at all) rag to wipe it off. As soon as it touched the table, the wood started to crack! It cracked the whole way through and ran about 1/3 the length of the table. The crack is at the top of the table, so I have put books on it to try to cover the crack. I am very disappointed that this product would have problems within 2 hours of buying it!"
5,Much better than expected,"This set is so much nicer than I expected. We received it as a gift for my three year old, and my experience with 'assembly required' furniture has always been that its cheaply made. But not in this case, very sturdy, beautiful set. As far as I can tell it's not laminated, but solid wood. My 3 year old fits great at this table as do I when I'm working with her, so instead of just a toddler play table, this will probably be her homework desk for her first few years of elementary school!"
3,"Looks great, quality so-so.","Table goes together pretty easy. Although the legs never seem to stay quite straight no matter how tight you screw them in. Stands fine and the kids can do homework or color there. As long as they don't climb on it, it stays pretty stable."
5,Quality--Both company and product,"I purchased this table and chair set for my granddaughter for Christmas. During assembly I noticed a small imperfection in the top. It wasn't bad, but for a three year old, it was a disaster. I e-mailed the company and they sent a replacement top very promptly. I have to report that this is a great company to do business with. Their product is of great quality such as you would find in a library. Customer service is excellent. Hats off to KidKraft!"
4,Rock of Gibraltar,"Solid like Rock of Gibraltar. My two children love it, they fight to sit on the side where drawer can be opened. The finish is high quality.The only minor issue is that one chair's 4 legs are not level as water."
2,"My husbands, ""I told you so!""","I soo wanted to love this table. I did a lot of research and for a kid size ""espresso"" table for our kitchen. There were a lot of options but based on the reviews I decided on this one although it was more expensive then many. They said it was ""sturdy,"" and I wanted to keep it for a long time. I also liked that I could buy additional chairs individually. Well, after two months of use, my very lite then one year old managed to jump on the back of the chair in a way that broke it. Thankfully, baby was okay but as my husband fixed it, he said, ""Well here we are fixing the expensive, pretty, table and that cheap $20 one from IKEA over there is holding up just great."" Now a year later the second chair has been broken also. I can replace them for $40 each or I can buy another IKEA table with two chairs for $20 and stain them to the color I want... at least with the IKEA route, when my kids decide to be kids, I won't be frustrated at the loss."
2,"Looks great, but not functional for everyday use","I love the look and haven't had any problems with the chairs or drawers, like some other users. But I have to put a warning out to those who will be using this to eat on. After two months, we have bubbles in the top surface of the table. It is heavy, like wood. But my kids left a wet wipe on it for just minutes and the top is now ruined. If I had to do it over, I might buy this again, but use some type of plastic cover for the top. Even using pen on paper leaves indents on the top of the table.It looks great, but isn't very functional in a kitchen."
1,Not worth,It is expensive and I did not see the result after use. I should have keep changing water to reduce nitrate level and not spent on this product.
1,Fluval Nitrate Remover - Fail,"I bought Fluval Nitrate remover at a local store because it touts that it ""eliminates toxic NitrIte within a matter of hours"". It neither reduced nor eliminated the nitrite in my tank. The instructions are sparse - basically put the contents in the bag, rinse, and place bag in the ""final stage of filtration"". Maybe I failed to properly follow the three points of instruction. Maybe I expected more than I should have. $25.00 at the local store."
3,Works short term.,"The only thing that can change the nitrate levels are water changes every day until levels go down. Plants are also a big factor-get and keep them if the fish you have don't eat them all, my fish do!"
5,Crunch,"I got the crunch because it was different and unique. A helpful tool to have around the garage, and thats eactly what it is. Once this thing latches on to say, a stripped nut, it's not coming off. I was amazed when I saw the crunch unfold into extremely effective vice grips, then fold it back up into a tiny ractangle. Theres nothing wrong with this super tool. Never have I seen anything ""crunch"" this hard. When i first got it, I crushed a plastic pen to try it out. It shattered. I then moved on to the garage. I latched its shark jaw onto a stripped nut. This thing gives so much torque. I yanked and yanked but this was on tight. The crunch is also good to take on bike rides. It tightens the chain and all of the other hex nuts on it. The crunch is like every other leathrerman, except with less tools and a far better set of pliers. This, and the micra, are the most used of my leatherman collection. (read my micra review)."
5,Best pocket tool on the Planet!,"I wear this tool on my belt every day and use it daily. The adjustable locking pliars are top quality and can actually break nuts and bolts loose that have been torqued down on most light to medium jobs. This tool is remarkably handy, tough and built with the highest quality standards."
5,Best multitool on market,This is the only multitool that actually offers a real pair of pliers. The only thing wrong with the tool is that I persoally don't care for serratted knifes.
4,Nice tool--clever design but somewhat limited,"I have a Leatherman Wave, a PST and an assortment of Micras (they tend to get lost). This company makes good stuff. The Crunch has a clever design. Who knew you could fit fully functional vise grips in a small belt pouch? The only downside is that the mechanics required to pull off this feat limit the space available for other tools. This tool will get lots of use, but the lack of a plain blade and scissors dimishes its jack-of-all-trades function a bit."
3,HomeManage Home Inventory Windows Software,It was ok.Had a hard time geting it to run.Softwair good. Seller not.
3,"Decent exercise in style, but doesn't quite work","It's soulful dance rock in the style of the Rolling Stones, but it rolls smoother than the stones, and the lead singer doesn't have as good of a voice. The problem with this recording is that the songs don't quite stick as well as they should because they're so smooth and attribute that to the production it's so smooth, and I think the band would fair better with a slightly rawer sound. There are still really good pop songs like:Six Pacs, Come Love Me, Oh, How She Gave Me Love, and the song about an angel. I wouldn't recommend the album to anyone, though. Fans of the short-lived series ""Young Americans"" might want to download ""Six Pacs"" because it was the very catchy them song."
5,EPIC,"This is an AWESOME cd, it epic to the extreame..........just sit back and let the music take you in, or be on the go..............BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Where would they be without a little love?,"I am a huge Dave Matthews Band fan. My brother is too. But when he bought this CD, I had to burn myself a copy. It's pretty cool. It's not the best, but it's really good. And there are 12 tracks, but only 10 are listed. A remix of ""She Gave Me Love"" is by far the best track. Other highlights:Six Pacs (1) Come Love Me (3) Decieved By an Angel (4) All About It (6) and Boyd Tinsley plays on ""Open Your Mind""Solid Album."
4,Worth It for Any Fan of Latin Rock,"I lived in Central America back in the 80s, when Alux got most of its airplay. At the time, it shared time with other latin groups, such as Mecano and Hombres G, and Alux definitely held its own. I would best describe the band as the U2 of Central America due to the social commentary of most of their songs. I recommend this album to anyone that likes classic rock, and if you like Spanish Rock, don't miss out on this very good band."
2,Nice chisels that require a bit of maintenance,These chisels are inexpensive and very comfortable to hold. They're great for general use around the house but I wouldn't recommend them to anyone who's seriously interested in fine woodworking. My main gripe with these chisels is that they get dull too quickly. I think the metal is too soft. You'll have to hone them quite often in order to keep them sharp.
5,Great entry level set,"Not for stripping paint or prying lids - these chisels are professional quality, but more affordable. Squared handle provides great grip, no rolling. Highly recommended."
1,Ranks in top 10 worst movies ever made,"I stumbled upon this film in a closing Blockbuster store. It was $1.99. I should have known right then. I am a Dempsy and Judd fan which is why I thought, ""Hey, what a find."" Being a fan is the only reason I watched it in entirety because I was certain there would be some of substance coming. Something intriguing? Something interesting? Instead I have to share it was completely awful. From beginning to end. A equally predictable and irrational film and no show case for either star. They had zero chemistry and clearly no direction. One star is a gift."
1,If you like inane foul language...rent this!,"The Patrick Dempsey approach to movie making...If you can't be funny...just use a lot of four letter words.If you can't be cleaver...just use a lot of four letter words.I couldn't past the CONSTANT use of the ""F"" word.What a waste of time.I wasted five minutes watching this garbage.If you see Patrick Dempsey's name on the credits...save your money.Sorry, I made a mistake...one star is too many!"
1,unbearable...,Worset movie I have seen in a pretty long time... Ashley Judd didn't have much part in it... Psycho babble... Even the twisted ending wasn't impressing... What a waste of 5 dollar HD movie!!!
3,Goofy,"The 4 and 5 star reviews are out of their minds. Yes, it was quick and fun, but this is not the best movie of the year."
5,"Nice, clean, complete entry level monocular","It is all here. The low power (3.1) is a real help and gives the 15000 amplification more clout on the screen. A hidden benefit is the use of AA batteries(Quick: betcha you've got two to use rigbt now if needed) as opposed to some ohscure and expensive photo shop type. The gain in, say, a large dark room with the IR generator is all but explosive. Spherical distortion is all but non-existant. The ""user manual"" is a joke, but that is just fine since you put in your AAs at dark and just go experiment. Simple to use and in ten minutes you should be expert. With just a little ambient light I was very happily surprised at the detail of the images.All in all, a VERY GOOD BUY."
3,Monoculars are a plus,"If you're shopping for a night vision binoculars and don't have that much money, then this is a really good bet. This monocular used infared vision so you can see clearly in the dark. They work really in the light and dark. Good buy for the price."
2,disappointed,I bought this for my husband. We waited until dark and then tried it out. He stood outside about 10 feet from me and I looked at him through the scope. I could make out a bright figure in his shape but could not see any features. Peripheral objects had slightly better clarity. I'll wait until the technology gets better for the home consumer and buy again. This one is going back.
4,This is more than what I expected. It really works great.,You can see in complete darkness. It's very cool. My friends and I were quite impressed by it. The price is very reasonable too. I expected much worse for paying so little. The distance you can see is not bad either. It has an adapter that you can buy to see even further.
4,Fine Tool Set,"Though not the most expensive you can find, for the price I know I will get my use out of these chisels. This will be the lifetime set I will surely take care of. And now I am planning to get the gouges to match (and make a case for each.)"
4,Classic no brain humor,"I was catapulted into my high school years again as soon as i poped this one in... full on childish prank humor, its a good laugh when you need somthing simple. Includes the best episodes like the birth of cornholio..."
2,4 stars for the covers 1 star for the seller,"Seat covers fit nicely, G.F. likes them BUT,Dissappointed with seller - Tinkerbell seat covers were ordered as a christmas gift - seller sent items in a box with writing on the side saying ""tink seat covers"" in bold lettering. Gift recipient saw this when shipment arrived, spoiling gift."
4,Good Insight for the Broadcast Professional,As a working broadcast profesional with 25 years in the radio business. I found O'Days book to be a good realistic guide offering real world tips and insights into the workings of a radio personality. Any manager of highly creative people can use this book as a way to maximize their potential. I refer back to O'Days book on occasion when I need to be reinvigorated.
5,Radio morning show host gives O'Days book a thumbs up,"Dan's ""Personality Radio"" is the abosulte bible for anyone who does any kind of radio show.I still to this day go back and read or think about what Dan says in that book. It has so many good bits of information on how to be better at whay we do. Dan is honest, straightforward and always on target with his views and advice.This is the kind of book you can read all the way through in one night or read it one page at a time over a year's time. And you can go back and read it and still be informed about what makes you a better radio person."
4,Want to do mornings? Start here.,"Okay, so I don't do mornings but I do know a few people who do. However, I have read this book, and I found it to be very very insightful. Especially near the end of the book with the actual personality interviews. This book teaches you the ins and outs of doing bits, breaks, and what to do while you are on the air. This is a great book to read especially if you are looking to get into the radio ""business"". Because we all know in today's radio, you just can't get up and wing it anymore, and there aren't too many programmers who have time to stop and show you the basics. Pick up this book, It's definitely worth the money. You will be glad you did."
5,The bible according to radio...,"It's a simple review of this one really - I've been in city, national and international radio for the last 8 years and this is the one I keep coming back to gain and again when I need to remind myself of how it should be done. Personality Radio is the bible for jocks the world over, if you're in any way serious about your career then this is the place to start."
4,DJ or Radio Presenter?,A great book for aspiring presenters or DJs that want to take their careers to new heights... even if it is American! :)
5,great Guide for great Shows,"This Book helps every onAir Personality to improve his oder her show. Very helpfully tips for beeing a real Personality on the Air. After reading this book for the first time (i read it more then 5times until now) i couldn't wait for going into the studio for the next show. (My favorits are the Interviews with the Stars of the American industry and the exciting ""radio story"". If you can't meet Dan O'Day by joing one of his seminars - read this book ... and give it to your PD :-)"
4,a must for all deejays and radiopeople,"tons of useful tips, great radio stories and interviews with the legends."
2,Broke when dropped 3 feet!,"This double-headed measuring spoon appears to be well constructed on initial inspection, with a decent heft and simple, clean appearance. However, less than 6 months after purchase, a minor impact (fall off of a counter) made the 1-tbsp measuring scoop pop off of the handle! The revealed weld join was porous. For info this spoon is 18/8 stainless steel, and the spoon is made in China."
5,The work of a true artist,"Whether fronting the Dogs D'Amour or on his own, Tyla is a throwback to a long-ago time when troubadours roamed the countryside sharing their songs in hopes of gaining a meal, a good drink and a warm place to sleep.On ""Noctural Nomad,"" you have Tyla, his words and an acoustic guitar (with an electric guitar and/or some harmonic overdubbed here and there)creating songs that live and breath.The highlights are many, beginning with the dark yet uplifting tale of ""Unidentfied"" through the folk stylings of ""Legend of the Thief.""When Tyla offers up ""Another Night in the Life of a Day,"" you are left with the feeling he has taken a page from his own autobiography to share with you - and you can't help but smile.At the same time tracks like ""Error of My Ways"" and the haunting ""North of Darkness"" are thought provoking in a more somber way.As a whole, ""Nocturnal Nomad"" is a great listen from start to finish with nary a weak moment.Truly one of Tyla's best efforts."
4,"Notes on the tribes, provinces, emirates and states of the northern provinces of Nigeria",The only problem with this apparently informative book is that some of the pages either did not print out well or else they have faded.
1,check it out from the library,"I thought this book was disappointing. I was looking for more general ideas on how to decorate, but this book doesn't give that type of information. It shows specific rooms and how they were decorated. Also, in the quiz to find your decorating style, there are 20 question, and I scored 5 points in three of the categories (Traditional, Country, and Ethinic.) So, you'd think there would be a section on decorating in an ecletic style, but there isn't. If you want to see this book for decorating ideas, check it out from the library before buying--you'll be glad you didn't spend the money."
4,A sensible choice,"I am a big fan of the show! I found the book to have a variety of room styles. They offered tips to create the look and broke down the budget showing how the money was spent. I did expect a little more though. I've seen so many great episodes and I found myself wondering, ""how come they didn't include the room from that episode"". Nevertheless, it's still a book worth buying."
5,Great for those of us with fearful dogs,Easy to follow clear explanations of how to deal with your dog's anxiety and fear that don't involve hurting your dog.
4,"Deals with people fear, not dog fear...","I bought this book because my puppy is wary of other dogs. While the instructions given in this book can be applied to any fear the author focuses on fear of people. The book is still useful, but I would have liked a little help with my specific problem. I also purchased Help for your shy dog and that's a little more comprehensive on the various fears dogs have (inanimate objects, people, dogs, touching etc). It also made me feel better about having a shy dog and that she can be helped!! If you only get one book get Help for your shy dog. But, if people fear is your only problem then get Cautious Canine"
3,Not worth the price,"The book had some very good information but the word ""book"" is misleading. It is more of a long pamphlet. The price is high for so little information"
5,Got more than I bargained for!,"This slim publication is packed with a wealth of excellent information! If you are looking for a ""quick fix"", this is not the read for you. This book demands total commitment of the owner to help the dog become confident (and safe and reliable to have around, in the process) Nobody ever said owning a Dog would be easy, but if you follow the thoughtful directions in this book, you and your fearful dog have a good chance to become comfortable partners. I found this publication to be very helpful. Current Foster Owner"
2,ehhh...,"I discovered, after I bought and payed the shipping fee, this same pamphlet on my vet's impulse buy rack for cheaper. I guarantee that you, interested in your pet enough to buy yet another specialized book, have seen, heard, and read the information within a thousand times before. You would get more from literature from Authors Jean Donaldson or Nicole Wilde. I really don't know why Patricia McConnell, who has a great radio show here in wisconsin-""calling All Pets"" on NPR, wouldn't write a more thorough/expanded edition."
4,Well written & easy to understand ...,"Fortunately, there are very few overtly aggressive dogs, most dogs act aggressively because they are fearful ...Unfortunately though, the bite from an aggressive dog and one from a nervous dog are equally painful, and often attract the same dire consequences ...This is a great booklet that teaches us how to manage a nervous or cautious canine ...First, the author shows us how to identify our dog's fear ... and then the author teaches us (step-by-step) how classical re-conditioning can help to reduce such fear ... in a gentle and effective manner.Often the biggest barrier to effective training, is our own lack of clarity as to what is required of us as trainers ...But the short chapters and the step-by-step format used by the author makes everything so very clear and easy to understand ... And just as helpful, the author also provides suggesttions, when a particular step does not achieve that intended ...All in all, a useful booklet ..."
4,Great beginner's guide,"This is a great guide for learning the basics of how to counter-condition your anxious or fearful dog. It's short but concise, with clearly defined steps that are easy to follow. However, if you're looking for a really in-depth guide, or are already familiar with basic counter-conditioning, you would probably be better off with a more intensive guide. Still, for a quick refresher course or a foundation for future work, this booklet is great, and I do recommend it. (Plus it's cheap - what have you got to lose?)"
4,So you have a dog who is scared?,"This book is for you if you have a dog that is very cautious because he is scared, this is the book for you. This book will give you step by step instructions on how to change your furocious dog into a cuddly puppy."
3,Okay trainer,"We have a dog who is afraid of school buses, FedEx trucks, etc. Although this book is okay for training dogs with a fear where you can control the time and place the fear occurs, it doesn't help at all for unexpected triggers. It may help others, but not us."
1,Useless book for anyone who knows anything about dogs,"The Cautious Canine has no information that is helpful to anyone experienced with dogs. It took about 5 minutes to read. I had looked forward to this book since I have recently adopted a dog who will not come utililizing any of these common and well known methods. I was hoping for something of substance that could help me with a real problem. If you want something that is more advanced for dogs with severe problems with fear, save your money. This little brochure is useless."
2,The cautious dog,am really sorry this book just reiterates everything that I already knew and was published inother articles that I have read .The cautious dog
4,good guide,This is a booklet rather than a book. The book is a good basic guide on how to work with a fearful dog. It breaks down the steps nicely on how to do the training with your dog. Easy to follow and a quick read.
2,Treat Training Basic,"I wish someone would have posted that this is treat training behavior modification, although the author does say you can substitute a favorite toy. Although some of this information is useful, much of it I already knew. I was hoping for something more creative. For me, some of this training is not practical as I do not have an extended network of friends and family to come by and help with training by repeatedly ringing my doorbell, and I do not feel comfortable asking strangers to throw treats at my dog. We have a German Shepherd, our Vet said many of them are not food motivated, and our trainer also recognized the dog is not food motivated. The author also stated these methods helped her with fear of public speaking, I don't see how that is possible, did she have a cupcake or a vodka as she approached the podium? Overall I would not recommend this book."
2,Not very well written,I expected more from this book. It was recommended by a trainer but didn't do much to help with the problem
3,Good Information,The information was very helpful and informative. Though it is more of a detailed pamphlet than a book.Great help to me and my pup!
3,Cautios Canine,The book was not the edition that was pictured but a much later edition so I was a little disappointed in that.
5,Great book for fearful dogs!,"Quick read. Lots of useful, practical information for handling a fearful dog. I highly recommend it!"
5,Great classical counter conditioning book!,This is a great book. I am working with an animal behavioralist to socialize my 6 month old shepperd-husky mix Janey. She was a pound puppy and had no socialization at all when we got her from a local rescue.With our trainer's help and with the suggestions in this book Janey is rapidly gaining confidence and flowering into a happy little girl.A suggestion - Try baby food: turkey with veggies or poultry. Baby food is easy to swallow in stressful situations. Having a cautious canine choke on the positive association is counter productive.Good luck!
2,Be cautious...,"I am not giving the 2 stars and warning because of content (it is actually pretty helpful). The rating has to do with the description - this and many of the Patricia McConnell ""books"" are actually booklets... The main listing calls it a paperback - and it is, but when I paid what I did for this, I didn't exactly expect a tome, but I expected more than a little booklet that might be in your Vet's waiting room....and unless you scour the description, it is not obvious what exactly you are buying."
4,Very helpfull book,I have a new puppy from rescue. He is very fearful. Came from a bad situation. This book has given me a lot of good ideas. It is more of a pamplet than a book.
3,Some Good Information,"Like the title says, there is some good information. Some advice, to more experienced dog trainers is repeatative. Not bad to have, but wouldn't be my first choice to recommend to others. I prefer ""The other end of the leash"" to this booklet."
3,a let down all the way around,"thought this would have more original ideas as to solutions, not what is found in just about every other book out there..yet they seem to have more information than this item.for what it is...more a booklet/pamphelet, not a book, it is way overpriced!"
1,more like a pamplet,no short i thought it was a book.IT turn out it was not.Its disappointing.Its helpful info just too short.If your looking for novel move on
1,Don't Buy this Book!,"When I got the book, I thought they sent me an empty box. It is literally 30 pages long and that includes the index. It is more like an informational pamphlet than a book. It did not have enough information in it for me."
2,Cautious of this book on canines,I don't feel this book has a workable solution to the problem. It is a method that requires much more than most people can give to the problem. The book is actually a booklet and the cost was too much for what it offers.
2,Nice Magazine Article,"I guess I should have noticed the ""29 pages"" in the description. It's 15 pages of 8x10 paper folded in half, two staples, and a cover. That works out to 19.83 cents per page. Amazon's paperback ""War and Peace"" [$10.46] at 1472 pages would cost $291.95 if published by Dr. McConnell.Calling this a book or booklet seems a little much. Perhaps ""pamphlet"" is a better descriptor."
1,Never recieved item,"I don't know how great this book is, because I never recieved it. I was given a refund only after I made a claim. Do not buy from this seller!!!!"
5,"The best leatherman, ever","I have a LOT of leatherman tools. I've been satisfied, more or less, with all of them - from the original pocket tool to the micra on my keychain, to the Crunch and Wave.When I choose one to carry with me, it seems that I choose the Wave. Sturdy, handy, the one-handed opening does it for me. Great tool."
3,easy to rust,"it is easy to rust. I just washed it once and then it rusted.secondly, it is difficult for me to unfold some tools.I guess victorinx tool would be much better."
5,Whatta Tool!!,I like tools! My problem is- usually they are where I am not! However- The 'Wave'- Hanging on my belt at all times- it is there and- it is indispensible! Just worked my cabin over in Alaska- used that little tool constantly- Even cut out the 'Moon' on my Outhouse door-with it! If you need one tool-to pack-and of the highest quality and versatility- The Leatherman Wave is it!
2,Bad steel,"I am on my second Leatherman Wave. My only complaint is that I cannot keep the blade sharp!! I have been sharpening knives, chisels, sissors, etc. for many years and have had this problem only once with only one knife; a high carbon steel knife made around 1920. The steel was bad. The steel used in the Leatherman Wave will not, I repeat, will not hold an edge. I now have to carry a Swiss Army Knife if I want to cut anything! Now that Swiss Army Knife has a multi-tool, I will get it."
5,A great tool!,"My leatherman has become a part of my life, and I can't imagine going anywhere without scizzors, a knife, a screwdriver, and all the other tools right at my fingertips. I use it every day as a college student, and even on vacation it is invaluable. I would feel naked without it. I even started wearing belts just so I could use the belt holder.I would highly reccomend this to anyone. Seriously. Just get one. You'll thank me later."
4,Versatile and handy,"With the many daily taskings I deal with in the Army, one of the most commonly heard expressions is ""Does anyone have a Leatherman?"" It combines many commonly needed tools into a compact design and is an invaluable part of my gear. Whether making adjustments to a rifle sight, cutting stubborn equipment tie-downs, or replacing screws in a helmet, it's nice to always have the right tool at hand."
5,Stunning after all these years!,"Updated review in 2006Now this is one poignant piece of soul-searingwork! I was never really a fan of godflesh (the'main' musical affiliation of composer JustinBroderick), but once upon a time I did have myfirst hearing of this particular album and wasinstantly mesmerized. Its not consistent inthe sense that one tends to expect from 'ambient'in general - there are moments of abrasiveness,but Justin perhaps never meant for this album tobe classified as such anyway; he doesn'tcompletely remove the industrial side of things.And tet this album has rich and dark shades ofbeauty that beg to be listened to again and again.Its those gentler 'silver-seas of mercury' whichare done to such effect that maintains this CD asone of the TOP gems of isolationist excursions.I personally treasure this piece of work as Justin'smoment of triumph. Its a lucid, raw, haunting andunique piece. Recently, Final 3 came out and I'mdying to hear it!Highly Recommended!"
1,?????????What The????????????,"I'm a huge fan of Godflesh....But I'm sorry I paid $10 for this piece of CRAP! Because I knew Justin was a part of it. I feel robbed, even if you had a mountain of drugs I still don't know what you're supposed to get out of this! How bout a new FLESH album, STREETCLEANER style! As for this ONE it's off to the trade-in pile..."
4,"Rod Laver Mid, wish I had a pair","These look hot in black on black, and if you like shoes, you should like these. I wanna get a pair of these!"
3,"Pretty, but doesn't sound good","This product is shiny chrome. Nice. Amazon shipped very quickly. The price is right! They do work. They are loud.Under the chrome, it is plastic.The advertising says everything is included. Not so. More wire and connectors are required.The video on the site gives an audio of 2 note harmony and is nice, similar to what I remember from the 60's. These horns put out 2 notes, but they don't harmonize. When only one is active, the note is very dirty with other frequencies muddying up the note. The second one just makes it more muddy and louder. We now have 2 loud dischordant horns, not the sound of a '56 Buick! :-(What can I expect for 23 dollars?"
3,Cute Classic,"If you started to sing ""Grey skies are gonna clear up..."" I'm sure everyone could finish ""Put ona happy face."" But not everyone knows that little tune is from Bye, Bye, Birdie. This musical is a sweet little show that really is in between the classic musical style and the modern musical. Its quite enjoyable to listen to if you want some light toe tappers. It also has some good ballads and duets. So its a nice CD to have and $11 isnt a bad price. However if your looking for the next CD that'll be on repeat in your player for the next month, this is not it. I would hope collectors would have this one, but if not get it. People who have just started likeing musicals, this isnt a bad one to test the waters outside of the classical musical or the modern musical. Favorite song: ""Baby, Talk to Me"""
3,Unexpected but not disappointed,"I love Bye Bye Birdie, but I have only seen the movie. I really like Broadway cast recordings so I thought I would order this instead because several cast members were the same and there were some other big name additions. However this recording is nothing like the movie. Even the same actors have different melody lines and lyrics. It is however upbeat, bright and fun to sing along with."
3,cute work but not outstanding,"I liked this album but I wouldn't classify it as one of the best OCR around. Dick Van Dyke is not a great singer but I'd imagine he was dynamite to see on stage. Chita Rivera does her usual great job and Dick Gauthier's singing will surprise folks who only know him from ""The Love Boat"" or ""Fantasy Island"". Worth owning if only to complete your collection of Broadway shows."
2,History with Find and Replace,"This is not Turtledove's best work -- in fact it is one of his weakest. He has simple taken actual history and done a find and replace, changing north to south, east to west, and most character and place names with puns (some obvious, as Nathen Bedford Forrest = ""Ned of the forest""; some rather more obscure as New York = ""New Eborac"" {old english place name for the site of York}) This game of name replacement seems to be the main point of the book, and might have supported a short story, but not three novels.The puns draw from a wide set of languages and references, although this causes a linguastic mishmash in the resulting names, with no internal explanation.The magic is a simialr find and replace of technology, with no consideration given to how actual magic would change things.I think the author should have done a straight historical novel about the Civil war, skipping the replacements of names and tech. this would have been a rather better book, IMO."
5,bought the best and got what I expected,"An excellent product! It is hard to put more of a review than that. The bits are sharp and durable, and I have found several uses for the bit stops that I don't think were intended. If you need something to countersink a hole and get it ready for a screw, then you have found a tool that will definately save you time."
5,Like it better than the Micra,"I've had a Micra for over two years, got a Squirt S4 last month and already prefer it to the Micra. The color didn't peel off, it fits a bit better in my hand, I like the tweezers much better and the tools are more accessible."
3,Not all it's cracked up to be...,"I bought this book because of all the sparkling accolades America's critics have given it. However, all those lush comparisons to Mark Twain, Will Rogers and James Thurber are really rather unmerited. It wasn't until the end of the book that I actually began to laugh and get into the characters. But the last fifth wasn't good enough to save the first four. Perhaps this book would be more enjoyable if it had been marketed as what it really is: laments about age, art and family with the occasional absurdism thrown in for fun."
4,Like going home and hanging out with friends and family.,"Fans of Lake Wobegon have met these characters before. Now, in novel form, we get to spend a year or so with John Tollefson, Wobegon native who has gone to New York State to manage a radio station. The situations he gets himself into may or may not happen to others we know in ""real"" life"", but we can relate. Keillor's narrative style, so popular from his years behind the ""Prairie Home Companion"" mike, comes through, and at times I could hear his voice in my head as I read. Some of his rambling narrative style is rough sailing for a reader, but the end result was always worth working through the sentences a second time."
5,garrison keillor at his best,"This book provides us with a view of ""Lake Wobegon - the Second Generation."" If any Keillor fan has ever wondered what happened to the Bunsen children or other young residents when they grew up, now we know. They may have escaped to greener pastures (or at least down to the Cities), but they still can't quite escape the home town in their heart. There really is a chuckle a page in this book. Sometimes the gentle barbs are aimed at institutions like colleges or public radio, but the most clever continue to be aimed at the citizens of Lake Wobegon who really are universal citizens. My favorite is Byron Tollefson, John's dad. A must for Lake Wobegon fans."
4,A return (of sorts) to the Wobegonian Utopia,"Keillor's novel is sharpest, and funniest, when the protagonist John Tollefson finds himself returning to Lake Wobegon. Those sections were so terrific, that I wished for a lot more of Wobegon, and a little less of the rest of the novel."
2,Boring,"An overly long, silly submergence in all things Wobegonian. Keillor's first attempt at a full-length novel ..., and it shows! There are some inspired passages here and there, there are some entertaining chapters, but mostly it's much ado about very little -- and mostly not very funny. One keeps asking oneself, ""Why am I continuing to plow through this book?"""
4,Really pleasantly surprised,"I can't believe how much I'm enjoying this book. I thought Garrison Keillor was famous for kind of funny jokes, sort of corny, jokes that were really were more should-be-funny than funny. I have been really surprised, happily, at the depth of the story and the narrator's (I guess his) comments. Enjoyable."
3,Wobegon Boy,"This is a mid-life crisis story about a small town boy who doesn't really grow up. He takes his career and relationships for granted and when he does find the girl of his dreams she keeps him at arms length. Keiller incorporates the characters and locations in and around Lake Wobegon into the story line, taking shots at the Lutherins, Unitarians and Catholics along the way. I was amused throughout the book and laughed out loud on at least 6 occasions. I recognized 2 side stories from his radio show, there may have been more."
4,laughing out loud,"I read this one over the span of two weekends. I found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion. Keillor describes well what is feels like to grow up in Minnesota and go and live with ""Big City"" People from the East. Having lived a little of what he described may have made it more realistic though. Definitely more valuable to me than having breakfast a perkins on an ordianry morning (the equivalent value)"
3,Not up to Keillor standards,"For what it is, the book is not bad, in fact it is quite good. It is only in the light of Keillor's previous works that I give this a 3 star review.Unlike many of his previous works, this is a cohesive story centering on one character, not a melange of various people or a collection of stories. Thus, character development and plotting are much more important. These elements are successful, but I could not help feeling that something was missing.Perhaps I was expecting the book to be funnier. Perhaps I was expecting more quirky little Wobegon people to pop up and do strange things. Instead, this is the story primarily of the boy who left Wobegon and all his trials and loves that ensue. This is somewhat interesting, but it does not feel interesting enough. The feeling I get is that once a Wobegonian is removed from the pack, they become - well - boring. I wonder if the main character's life is really interesting enough to fill a book."
4,A Prairie Home Companion Companion,"I found some wit and insight in Mr. Keillor's novel, although I think it helps if you've listened to ""A Prairie Home Companion."" Thus you'll be familiar with Lake Wobegon, Minn., the characters and the society he spoofs and worships at the same time.The book is certainly better than Mr. Keillor's Jesse Ventura satire, which I bought at the same time at a going-out-of-business book store in Dennis, Mass. That was a terribly disappointing book; I don't believe I would have bought this book if I had only purchased the Ventura novel.I recommend ""Wobegon Boy"" to fans of the show who are about the same age as the narrator (early 40s)."
3,Not his best work,"While there are many flashes of the descriptive narratives we have come to enjoy from A Prairie Home Companion, this novel falls in the category of self-indulgence by the author, with long dissertations regarding things of no concern to anyone, and which utterly fail to advance the storyline. Garrison has done much better work prior to this and in my humble opinion needs to stay with what really works for him. That is, the explanation of how life is approached(or avoided)by those Scandanavians of the Lutheran persuasion living in Minnesota. THAT is real life chronicled by a master."
3,Too many stories detract from the main narrative,"I liked this book, despite it's rather obvious preachiness (political correctness bad. Okay, Mr. Keillor, I got it. Several times.). It was an engaging book that held my attention throughout. However, all of the stories told in the book became more and more of a distraction as the novel wore on. At a few points I felt like shouting, ""get on with it already!"". Don't get me wrong, some of the stories were very enjoyable to read. But not in the middle of a more interesting narrative, where they added little."
4,Another Solid Outing By Keillor,"Reading a Garrison Keillor book (except for the bizzare Book of Guys) is like laying on a couch next to a fire under a comforter while the rain falls outside. Wobegon Boy continues the Keillor streak of writing ""comfortable"" literature. The characters are solidly defined, the dialogue is witty, and the situations that arise in the book are sharply told.There aren't any surprises in Wobegon Boy. The subject is one that Keillor has visited many times. But, then again, one doesn't buy a Garrison Keillor book to be surprised. One gets his books to rekindle the feelings of home and family that one possesses (or wishes they possessed) in their minds. And Wobegon Boy is more than adequate to meeting this task."
4,....and all the children are above average,"I'm an old Keillor fan - way back to my college days when he had a morning radio show on MPR and performed at the U of M St. Paul Student Center - crowds numbering 30-40. The characters are all so familiar and as the wife of a Lutheran Minnesotan, I was often doubled over with laughter reading this book. My family's favorite line: ""I want to die peacefully in my sleep like Grandpa - not screaming in terror like the passengers in his car.""I agree with some previous reviewer - this isn't a novel. Why didn't Keillor's editors insist this be a book of vignettes or essays? Those forms would have given the material more impact."
1,Outside and Inside Kangaroos,"Although this book contains incredible photographs I am reviewing it unfavorably based on the age range (4-8). I bought it to use in a Kindergarten classroom. The pictures are too explicit revealing internal organs, stomach and undigested food, the womb, leg muscles and tendons. Luckily, I looked at it before putting it in the classroom. I feel that the students would have been frightened, not only by the graphic nature of the pictures but also by wondering how the pictures were taken. Akin to a dissection book. Definitely for older children and even then, for those not squeamish."
5,Rather unique look at kangaroos. Good book if you can get it.,"This is a very interesting, unique book about kangaroos. It shows you both the regular shots of kangaroos, along with interesting text, but also, you get a firsthand look at the anatomy, muscles, heart, womb, embryo, joey, etc. of the kangaroo. This is good for the future (child) veteranarian, or doctor. It is a good book to introduce the concept of an embryo or fetus to a child as well. This book is unique, I'd never seen anything like it in the classroom."
4,Cool Diver's watch,"This watch has flawless design. Good lookin'. And most affordable watch with Seiko's ""Kinetic"" movement. It's a real bargain. If you are looking for a Men's diver's watch, this is it. I just wish this watch has smaller thickeness and a bit lighter weight."
1,Cheap chisels,"Don't be fooled. This chisels are not worth their price. I was given a set two years ago. I never used them until three months ago. I was using my old reliable set. I took this chisels out of the box and went to hone them. Come to find out, the still is severly deformed. The facets are totally out of place and you can not get a smooth bevel on them---There's NO WAY you could double bevel these. I reground them myself to as square as possible. No sooner than I did that, the half inch chisel started breaking the corners! I did not blue the steel as I use a Tormek sharpening system. Plus, I was using them without a mallet---by hand! Cheap metal, cheap craftsmanship, poor quality!"
1,Just plain junk,"I purchased a set of these chisels and I wish I hadn't. They are very poorly machined and the metal is very weak. I am seriously thinking about taking all six chisels and throwing them in the trash, box and all. They are no where close to being flat on the back. And to be honest there just not worth the two hours or better you will take to lap the back. Anyone thinking of bying these chisels should just save there money. I here Lie-Neilsen is comeing out with high quailty set. For all of those people(myself included) a word of advice, don't by cheap tools save your money and by somthing that will last. It will be cheaper in the long run!"
3,Could've been better,"When I received this chisel set in the mail, the wooden pieces inside the box had come unglued, so the chisels were loose in the wooden box. If the box had been made better or perhaps better prepared for shipping, I would've been happier with the purchase. Luckily, I was able to glue the pieces back in place successfully and the product is fine."
1,Looked cheap and fragile,"Ordered these from Amazon and shipping was fast as usual. The box the chisels come in is pretty flimsy and cheaply made...don't let the fact that these chisels have a box to store them in influence your decision to buy. I had heard good things about these chisels from friends and neighbors who had them but had never seen them until I received my Amazon order.The chisel handles are hard plastic but upon further inspection of my chisels, one of them had a crack in the plastic with some of the plastic already missing! The chisels were brand new as they had no wear marks at all! The plastic had cracked all the way down to the metal and that was enough of an omen for me to return them! The chisels just look cheaply made to me.Returned to Amazon and went to Sears and bought some Craftsman chisels...I am VERY happy with them."
3,bad description,"the description did not match the product!...... it read ..""Marples"" when actually they are ""Irwin"""
3,New Woodworker,"Skip the box! Very difficult to achieve a flat surface on these chisels. Very frustrating and time consuming. Once flat surface is achieved, kept a good edge. Saw new Marples chisels at Lowes today. They have a better-- cushioned-- handle. I would look at other chisels first if I were starting over."
2,Poor design,"The dispensing hole is too small, so you have to squeeze super hard to get only very little out. Also, it's hard to know how much to twist the top to fully open the hole. Look, just trust me, it's more hassle than it's worth."
4,A pity...,"...that that book be out of print. It trully is beautiful. It also include many a cover of famous SF books, such as R A Heinlein's ""Friday"", and many more great books by Larry Niven and co. I would strongly recommend anyone interested in SF to try get that book...Many SF art books are slightly disappointing to me because they mix styles. Michael Whelan, though, is one of the most perfectionist and 'clean' SF artist - his pictures are of strange places and times, or familiar heroes, but easily understandable and enjoyable."
1,"Stupid, stupid, stupid","I am reading this book now. I grew up in Echo Park and still live in the area. I didn'tknow that Echo Park was in E.L.A. News to me. The author obviously doesn't know either.She says that Echo Park is in E.L.A. yet the gang does business with ELA like it's a different area,which it is. There is one part where Cecilia says that the ""Baby girl made me glow all over like afirefly"". There are no fireflies in Los Angeles. How would she know how they glow? Obviouslythese girls were not well educated, where did they get all the metaphors?Not all the cholas and cholos I knew from the neighborhood were stupid. (And, I knew a few generations).They were not book smart, but street smart. None that I knew spoke as eloquently as these ladies do.My college educated friends don't speak as eloquently as they do.This story is more fiction than the author wanted it to be. It's a fairytale."
1,locas too loco,ordered this by mistake!anyone want it? I am not capable of getting interested in gang life...so many other topics.although it is an integral part of the mexican history...it is not interesting enough for me to read about.i feel for anyone who is in a gang or who is influenced by gang presence in their neighborhoods.
4,Great deal for the money,"Functionality, sound and controls all as advertised. Remote and iPod charger work fine. Great deal for the money. Slightly bigger than I thought with the detached speakers."
4,iluv,Very good looking ! setup very easy !(unless hanging on wall) . System is light so no need to hit studs when hanging. Sound quality is merely ok. Needs a lot more bass.
5,Fantastic,"We bought this system for our daughter for Christmas. She is 15. She loves it.We mounted it directly above her head, the head of her bed on the wall and seperated the speakers, one on each opposite wall.Diane"
2,Bought it and returned it,"I had the feeling the product was refurbished before I opened it :) However, after using it for a day I needed to return it in order to save my marriage. My wife was very unhappy with the product. CD player hung all the time like old CD players do after a while.your call"
5,Made me laugh out loud!,"""Humorous Stories and Sketches,"" be Mark Twain, brings together 8 comic gems by this giant of American literature. At around 80 pages this Dover edition may be small in size, but it's big in laughs and wit.The 8 pieces are ""The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,"" ""Journalism in Tennessee,"" ""About Barbers,"" ""A Literary Nightmare,"" ""The Stolen White Elephant,"" ""The Private History of a Campaign that Failed,"" ""Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses,"" and ""How to Tell a Story."" Twain satirizes gamblers, journalists, police detectives, international diplomacy, the military, and other things.Particularly effective is the Civil War narrative ""The Private History""; it's funny and bitingly satirical, but also surprisingly poignant as Twain reflects on the brutality of war. For laugh-out-loud funny, however, the elephant story is my favorite. A perfect book both for literature courses or just for individual pleasure reading."
3,Disney's Cartoon Classics,They Are Made in Video at July 1991. I Have One on Video At home and I watch Video for long time ago.
5,Easy Listening music,I love this product and enjoy playing it while I am reading on my Kindle Fire HD. It is a wonderful relaxing way to read.
3,Scudder and a snuff flick,"My problem is, after reading When the Sacred Gin Mill Closes, all other Matthew Scudder novels, pale in comparison. This is a good novel, but not great. I have read about 5 of his books now and this is a good read. An insight into his relationship with his father. I am not big on endings with a hail of gunfire, but it was done better than most."
4,Matthew Scudder reviewed,"Block's series featuring Mathew Scudder is ably carried on in ""A Dance at the Slaughterhouse""."
5,Block's Matthew Scudder is one of the best,"I started reading Lawrence Block a few years ago and I have grown to really appreciate his Matthew Scudder books. Block can write extremely readable prose, he can create believable (and interesting) characters, and he can tell a story. ""A Dance at the Slaughterhouse"" is the perfect example of this. This is a great book that captures the reader early an doesn't turn him loose until the end. Elaine, T.J., and Mick are wonderful supporting characters for Matthew Scudder, who is dogged yet resourceful in his starring role. Scudder is flawed but still highly skilled as a detective and the reader becomes attached to this character very quickly. If you haven't put Scudder/Block on your ""must read"" list, do so immediately."
2,Please add color !!,"I just received this book, and although the content does meet my expectations, I must say that some figures are of disappointing poor quality (3D protein representation for instance). I haven't seen the original German version, but it looks as if the English (American) editor has saved a few bucks by simply copying the figures on a B&W copy machine. This is outrageous ! We are living in the 21st century, and any 10 years old computer geek is capable of producing high quality color figures with a decent scanner ! Given the price (70 dollars !), I can't give more that 2 stars !"
1,A collection of bad marital advices,"The book starts with how supposedly miserable the marriages that our mothers had because these women put themselves after their husbands and children. It asserts the importance of retaining the wife's own identity as an individual by keeping her maiden name, her ""me time"", and her career. It also says that men should help with the household chores too because marriage is after all an equal partnership. I like this way of thinking so I decided to buy the book. But it continues with recommendation to have sex affairs with other men (and/or women as well!)in order to stay single-minded and happily married. It also recommends to have sex at least with 10-20 different men before you say 'I do' to your husband-will-be so you know what you're getting from him. And don't bother about your husband's feeling, you must tell him the exact number. I couldn't help but wonder what actually the author's definition of a successful marriage is."
1,Worst book EVER!,"If I could give this book less then 1 star I would. There really is no helpful advice for a successful marriage, only an author with disdain for and type of traditional marriage. I almost found it offensive. I kept waiting for the book to get better but it never did. I would compare it to a very long, poorly written, magazine opinion article. Don't waste your money on this crap!"
4,Perfect for my Kitchen!!!,"Perfect pair of bar stools for my kitchen with stainless at bottom. Wish that the seats were a little more quality, but still overall very nice."
3,not made for bug booties,"these chairs are great especially for the price my only concern is that when you sit on them the hydrolic lift goes down.and stays down, now it has a lever on the bottom that indicates this is the way to make the chair move up or down this is not the case, so if you behind dosen't weigh less than 99 pds these are not the chairs for you..LOL"
4,Great Deal!,"No complaints what-so-ever. If the seats were a bit more plush or more leatherly realistic, then I would give it 5*'s, but otherwise, they're really great! Solid, hold alot of weight, and fun for my kids. Great to use at the dining table too when we need an extra seat.So happy we bought them!"
5,Very Nice!,"We just got these yesterday and we really like them. Very good value for the price. Bought 6 and will be using them for our new bar in the basement. I didn't install the plastic ring that was suppose to go on the base; it looks better without it, IMHO."
1,poor quality,"Both chairs got broken in one month. Definitly not good quality. The price is great, but you get what you paid."
1,Poor quality and unstable,Would not recommend this. I bought 6 or 3 sets. 2 of 6 were wobbly and unstable. Can be dangerous.
1,Worst. Defective item.,"I got this item pretty fast.As soon as I got, I assembled and one was perfect, the other one was broken, tear seat.I am very upset and unhappy right now."
1,barstools,The two barstools I ordered arrived with serious scratches on the base. These items should have been checked before shipping. Returning is a pain
1,Do not buy these chairs,"As the saying goes ""You get what you pay for"". After assembly, one of the two chairs immediately broke when I first sat on it, and it now wobbles all over. The other chair while workign correctly, simply does not feel like a sturdy chair. I would not suggest these for adults or anyplace where you want decent quality chairs / bar stools."
3,Good for price,The item is good for the price but making this purchase online is not the way to go unless you are a smaller framed person. Full grown men may find this chair too small for the backside area. I weigh 220lbs. And find that it's a little to small for comfort I would go with a more traditional stool. But hey for the price you can't go wrong my kids love the chairs.
3,Not bad,"I thought this was made of wood because of the product name, it's not. The seats are padded vinyl. I don't know what the base is made of but every time I wipe it clean with damp cloth, it gets spotty. I bought this so I can have something to sit on till I find what I really want. So far, it does the job I want and I don't think I'll be replacing it soon."
3,winsome bar stools,"they look nice but are a little flimsy but for the price theyre good, work fineup and down and around"
1,Broke on first use,"While the stools look good aesthetically, the knobs are made of cheap plastic and are very fragile: they broke on first use.Was trying to adjust the seat length and pushed on the plastic knob the first time I sat on them, and it came apart in 2 peices. Have used super glue to fix but not sure how long that will last.Quite a disappointment."
3,cheap parts,"I guess you get what you pay for. One of the plastic levers broke during installation and the packaging was so dusty that I had to take it outside and close my eyes to unwrap some components.however, after having used the stools for a while, i like how they're holding up. Adding two stars."
2,Came up short,"The stools were easy to assemble and are attractive. They are not height adjustable. The pneumatic cylinders are inoperable. To return them is a logistical nightmare. So, I guess I'm gonna end up with limp chairs."
5,Wonderful,"Thanks, I have been looking for these chairs for a long time. They were incredibly cheap, qualified and fast. Awesome, Thanks"
2,"Not super sturdy, or comfortable, or confidence-inspiring","Got these 18 months ago for a kitchen remodel, loved the look and price. Long story short, they are not super supportive and don't feel very sturdy. If you're in the 190-200# range, they will not stay up at the selected height and will eventually sink down to the bottom position.I don't feel comfortable sitting in them and do not feel they support me well or safely. Too bad, they look nice, now they are just ornamentation for the kitchen bar. They may be cheap, but in this case you get what you pay for. Not recommended, unless you weigh less than 120# and don't mind no back support."
4,Really amazing for the price,"The stools work well, are attractive and seem sturdy enough for my household. There is nothing to compare for the price. They were very simple to assemble."
1,"winsome wood 20"" round table question about table height","i didn't see any other way to contact you to find out the table's height. this should be given but i didn't see it. i know it's 20"" round but how high is important. thanks gercoop@verizon.net gerry oconnor"
4,Excellent table and a perfect match with the stools,Purchased this table a couple of months ago but did not have any stool to go with it. Now that it has been paired with the stool I just got it's perfect.
4,Great Bargain on Nice Stools,"I got my adjustable bar stools very quickly after ordering them for a kitchen island. They are small enough that I am thinking about ordering two more. They were easy to put together and I am not mechanically inclined at all. The instructions are all in diagram format, so make sure you check to see if you have all parts first. The seats look and feel pretty sturdy, but I don't think a person over 200 lbs would be comfortable. There is not much surface area on the seat and they are not cushy enough to sit on for long periods of time. My four year old thinks they are the greatest and loves to spin on them and my ten year old enjoys being able to sit in the kitchen and adjust them at a height that works so she can do her homework. Fortunately, you have to be a certain minimum weight to adjust them which is a good thing. The only drawback is that I wish I had gotten them in brown to better match my dining set, but black works ok. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase."
5,Great Stools,"I bought these chairs to go into our pool table basement. We entertain a lot down there and needed some extra seating for company. Came across these and glad I did. Exactly what was needed. Great look, price, comfort, and style. Bought the matching Winsome pub table as well. Overall GREAT buy."
1,"ok,for the price.","Purchase two,couple of month ago.finally put them to gather.one cylinder is bad.would be nice to receive a new cylinder.o well what can you do.bought it on the internet."
2,Not worth the money,"Table is made of cheap pressboard wood & lightweight chrome. It is not sturdy and wobbles both on a rug or a flat surface. It isn't worth the 90$ because it just isn't a quality product. I'd pay about $40 for it to feel I got my money's worth. Won't be worth it to send back because of shipping charges, but I won't buy furniture from Amazon again sight unseen, and this will end up outside as summer patio furniture."
4,Nice for the price.,"Updated since this review. See additional posts. Sharp looking with the shiny chrome look and black seat. Looks great in a stainless steel kitchen. It does not say it but these seats have a maximum weight of 200 lbs. so my husband cannot use them. They go up and down, but it depends on your weight. I am 115lbs. and I can go down not up. My Daughter is 48lbs. and can only go up. Still a deal but keep the weight restriction in mind if you want everyone to use them."
3,"Nice look, but not very comfortable.","Great looking stool, but you won't want to sit on them for any length of time--the seat has very little padding."
4,GREAT table - but very light.,"For the money its a great buy. VERY easy to put together. Took me about 15 minutes.It looks great and it does the job. The only thing that would make this product ideal would be a heavier base. The table is very light, so if you lean against it or brush against it - well lets just say don't keep anything valuable on top of it (or breakable for that matter)."
3,For the Price!,These chairs rule for the price! We ordered 2 sets and for some reason out of each set one of them sits kind of sideways when attached. But alls well it works.
2,Do not like table top,I can not get the top of this table to look like it did when I bought it after only one party. Table top does not have a good material on it. Should return it--but probably will just deal with it somehow.
3,One stool not proper,"One of the stools was perfect but the other stool was not in proper piece. The installation steps clearly said that the plastic cap should be removed from the standing tool prior to placing the upper seat on the tool. But in one of my pieces, the standing tool didn't have the plastic. I had a tough time placing the seat on the tool. Later I figured that the plastic was stuck to the seat base and hence it was not fitting on the standing tool. So it looks like someone had already tried installing this tool and did it wrong and that is why it was shipped to me. The plastic was stuck so tight to the tool base that I literally had a tough time removing it using a hammer and knife."
3,Chipped Table Top,"I received this table with a big chip missing out of the top. I like this table otherwise, but you're taking the risk of the same mishandling if you purchase this table."
2,Stains the walls,"I like this chair and the way it looks in my living room, but today I started to realize that it stains my white walls, I have the chair against my dining kitchen counter and its staining the wall below the counter top blue! This is annoying because now I'll have to constantly take the stains out myself. I don't know if this is because the chair is made out of some cheap quality or what.. but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. It looks great and the seats are fine.. but the quality? not so much."
2,Inconsistent quality,"I bought 2 sets of those stools, so a total of 4. one set is fallig apart at the stitches, the other set is fine. Since I bougut them seperately, I would consider the quality and materials used might be different. Will call customer support to see if they will replace the set that is falling apart and report back. After all, a company can't control the quality of everything they make and mistake could be made, but I want to see how they treat the customer after the sale, that is what will set them apart."
5,Great bar stools at a great price,"I wasn't expecting much from this extremely inexpensive set of two bar stools, but I was quite surprised by the superb build quality. Assembly is extremely easy and takes no more than five minutes. The height adjustment mechanism works well. They would be a bargain at twice the price!"
5,"Arrives quickly, looks great, easy to assemble, and great price","I always get my items from Amazon.com very fast and this was no exception. It arrived just a few days after ordering. The box was surprisingly small for two chairs. It was assembled in about 10 minutes each and looks great in my kitchen island. All at a great price, no taxes, no shipping charge!"
1,Save your money,"I said the same thing about some other tables I purchased at the same time, but the review is the same: poor quality. I realize that in order to get a truly exceptional table, I would have to spend a lot more than what I did for these tables. I get that. But for what I did pay, I thought that at least I would get something that was...a table. I'm not sure these even qualify. The tops of the tables are heavier than the cheap bases. And it doesn't take a genius to figure out what happens next...the fall over with even the slightest bit of weight. They were so bad, I sent them all back and just built some tables out of scrap wood...and the ones I made were better. Very, very disappointed."
2,handle was broken on the first day.,Handle is made of low quality material and was broken on the first day. The Rings that connected the upper and lower pole do not fit and were useless. They are apparently for decoration purpose and I ended up not using them.Seat height was a little bit difficult to adjust.I thought about returning the product but I chose not to go through the hassle.I was hoping for better quality given the price and good reviews from others. But I would only give a 2-star.
1,User,"Amazon, advertises this product for $69.99 on other web sites and when actually order the product the price increased by $10.00There is false advertising going on here.Very dissatisfied customer"
2,Base broke after 6 months,The bar stools looks great and functions very well. However the base is not made very well. It broke and the stool started wobbling after about 6 months of use. My family is not over weight by any means (heaviest person is 170 pounds). Tried to contact the manufacturer but received no response. Now I'm left with unusable bar stools.
4,Great product at a great price.,This product is exactly as advertised it arrived very quickly and whilst it needed some assembly it was easy to do and the product looks and works great.
5,Small but functional,This table suits my needs as a single person. Sometimes I don't want to eat in my bedroom and this table allows me to eat in the kitchen without taking a lot of space.
4,No Booster chairs needed any more!,"Not only did we receive great shipping time, (especially ordering in December), these stools are just nice. It was a breeze to put them together (the only tool needed was supplied with the stools). We liked them so much, we ordered a second set. It's nice to be able to have grandchildren sit at the same table with us and not need cumbersome boosters. Of course, the fact that the stools spin quite nicely make them a hit with our grandkids!Alaskan Gramma, Valdez"
1,do not purchase,Broke within 60 days after purchase - these stools broke off at the welds and cannot be repaired - do not purchase
3,Functional,"These chairs are easy to set up, functional, and have a small footprint. However, one of the screws to mount the stand to the seat came up through the pad and there is now a large bump in the top portion of the seat. Easily fixed with a small pillow, but fairly disappointing given that the rest of the chair is so well made"
4,Good stools,"We've had these chairs for about 2 months now. The chairs are comfortable for the short term, but not for the long term. They're very stable and durable."
5,Great Buy,"Pros:Nice lookingGreat PriceEasy to put togetherworks well on carpetCons:People that are heavier causes it to drop a little, but it is not a real problem"
3,"They look great, but cheaply made","I bought a total of 6 stools for my bar. They look great, I liked the black color.The problem here is that most of them arrived damaged. The black faux leather was marked because of the parts in the package. One seat was ripped. The chrome base is made with plastic, so it can be easily damaged or dented by your feet. All 6 bases had small dents.They are sturdy, I actually liked them, but I think they should be made with more quality."
5,Great Table,"I really like this sturdy, easy to assemble table. I highly recommend this product. Using it on stage in my church to hold the presenter's laptop."
5,Inexpensive elegance,These chairs were a great buy. They assembled quickly and easily and far exceeded our expectations as to their stability. They swivel very easily and with little effort. The height adjustment is simple to do with one hand and holds its selected height. And they look very stylish and classy. The only criticism we have is that the seats get a little sticky when you sit on them with bare legs on hot days. [Arizona in summer! :(] All in all a great buy for the money.
4,Dining chairs,"We received cahirs in two days, which was faster then we anticipated. Chairs do not have back or arms, but are very comfortable. Are easy to ensemble and easy to use (to bring up and down)."
1,"Waste of money, very cheap base.","I actually bought 10 of these to set around my home bar area. The base is so cheap that the welds on 3 of them broke within the first week. Terrible, do not purchase!"
3,"Hard to beat for the money, but they are a bit cheap looking","Just bought 4 of these chairs for my 900 SF apartment. They're actually pretty comfortable, in spite of one reviews I saw. They're also super easy to put together and arrive in small boxes. So don't worry about a huge box arriving at your door if you live in an apartment. I was actually quite surprised at how small the boxes are. All in all, they're not bad stools, they look pretty good, except the seats are plastic and they look every bit of it. If you just need something that is inexpensive and looks ok, these will work. If you're looking for something that looks a bit more classy, I would look for another stool. Albeit, it won't be as cheap as these."
1,Broken in 2 weeks,"One of the two stools broke just as I was moving (normally) it from one side of the room to another. Seriously, I put it toghether not even two weeks ago and didnt even use it! I pretty much traveled all days for two weeks! I had bought 2 before and reviewed as nice, because they do look nice! And decided to buy another 2! Big mistake!"
4,Barstools,We gotten a lot of compliments on the barstools. They easy to adjust and very confortable. Glad we got them.
2,get what you pay for,"The stools are nice looking, but very lightweight and cheap. They are good for temporary remodeling until you have the money to spend on something sturdier."
3,not the best but they work...,"these are certainly not the STRONGEST stools ever, but they work. The bases of the stools were dented on arrival, which was a bummer, but not worth the hassle of returning. the directions are vague. The biggest thing they don't tell you is you literally have to sit on it to assemble. once you have it all together, you have to sit on the seat to press in down into the hydrolics mechanism. it kind of ""snaps"" in but without the snap.Oh and where the stools main support beam connects with the base, there is a SUPER cheap plastic covering part. It doesn't LOOK bad, but it's defiantly not going to last forever.The stools are sturdy enough when they are down, but at fully extended up, they seem a little flimsy and defiantly tilty.On the up-side, when they are fully up, it is nice and tall... it allows my kids to sit at our 3 foot tall craft table at a level they can reach everything and see everything..."
5,amazing chairs,"Couldn't be happier with this purchase. I really didn't need four but for the price i bought an extra. All my company is very impressed when they see them. But when they sit in them they are really surprised!!! Although, kids like so much that you have to watch them cause they think it is a game to spin and go up and down. As for set up, never put something together so easy in my life. less then 5 minutes per chair.also, they are very slim so if you don't have much room they are perfect. to shine silver part don't use any harsh cleaners, a little witch hazel on a rag then buff to a shine is all you need. two thumbs up for this purchase."
2,Not great,"After reading all of the reviews for this it seemed like a good buy. It's not. Good price, very cheap quality and not sturdy. The post doesn't even screw into the base, it just sits in the base. An unsturdy seat is no good. When you sit on the seat, whether you weigh 120lbs or 200lbs, the seat falls down at least a foot. If you're here to save money, don't, step it up. If you're here because you don't have money, then buy it."
2,Not great,"After reading all of the reviews for this it seemed like a good buy. It's not. Good price, very cheap quality and not sturdy. The post doesn't even screw into the base, it just sits in the base. If you're here to save money, don't, step it up. If you're here because you don't have money, then buy it."
1,FAIL,"Don't get these chairs, we got them and one chair sunk to the bottom immediately. Pieces of junk, gonna give these away and get some quality chairs, I guess you DO get what you pay for, even a pair of stools with only one working hydraulic between the two, oh well...I learned"
1,Defective in 5 weeks.,"Don't get me wrong, as long as your chairs work its a great product but the lift in one of my chairs failed after about 5 weeks having used it maybe a dozen times. I tried to write the seller, but Amazon did not allow that as an option. At 5 weeks it was beyond the return time of 30 days. My only option was to write this. So I suppose one star due to having half my product fail so quickly and poor customer service in being unwilling to allow buyers to contact the seller."
4,JJ's,As per the price this stool is one of the best bar stool set... everything is perfect... Just one thing where you might think of bit better quality and that is the seat of the stools... which could be bit better (the cousion only leather is still good) but the one I got is still good to go..The look 4.5 out 5The quality 4.5 out 5The installtion process : very easy should not take more than 5-10 mins...Seat quality 3.5 out of 5Overall I'm satisfied with this product...
2,"Looks nice, cheap base","The chairs looks nice and are comfortable to sit in, but it feels wobbly so it feels cheap. Basically, the post of the chair does not screw or latch or attach to the base at all it just sits in it and the base looks like chrome metal but its cheap plastic so it doesn't really hold the base well so it feels kind of wobbly. I have a tall counter (46'') so I wish the chairs were an inch or two higher. probably would have gotten something different if I did it again"
1,Seat cover cracks and tears,Its been less than a year since I bought this bar stools and the seat cover has cracked on the edges and torn exposing the foam. Poor quality for the price paid.
5,Excellent choice!,"Super easy to assemble, I unpacked and put together 4 chairs in under 30 minutes. They came packed very well and look great! I would recommend these to anyone! Plus, great price!"
5,Very Contemporary,"As you can imagine from the pictures, you buy these for the look not for ""comfort"". Most bar stools aren't used as your normal everyday chair anyway. These are great and definitely give you an expensive look for a small price. Best thing is that they go down low enough to be used as regular chairs to use at a coffee table. We love this as it provides non-awkward additional seeting to any room.One warning, as others mentioned, is that it takes a good bit of weight to lower these all the way. I weigh about 180 lbs and it will go down to the very bottom when lifting the lever. My wife is in the 105-115 range and it will go down, but not all the way. If a child around 50 pounds is on this, it won't move."
3,Great Addition to the MANCAVE!,these were a great addition to the mancave and look great. The install was easy and I was to start using them in a few minutes. I had one of the platic black peice break on the adjustment handle but I kinda expected that they way they are built.
1,Simply Re-used Parts By VillaWare!!!!,"The problem with this is that (as it appears to me) VillaWare has tried to cut corners by re-using all but the plates as it has on it's Panini Grill (which for the record is an excellent product - which I have given rave reviews). Check out the Panini Grill - unless you had these products in front of you & were able to open them up, you'd never be able to tell the difference between them. I would say, don't write off VillaWare products just because of one poor one, as I said I also own the Panini Grill & LOVE IT!!!!!!!! However, don't waste your money on this one - I hope VillaWare does right by their respected name & pulls this off the market completely.One thing I will say, the ""audible warning sound"" that was mentioned in a previous review is actually a click - the same as the Panini Grill, but listen carefully or you'll miss it."
1,One word for this and it starts with S,Come back here and write a review as soon as you get over feeling foolish for not having listened to these reviews.
3,Hey- that's sort of insulting to Americans!,"I have to admit, I only read the first 18 percent, but that was enough. In a few words, Henty's saying that the American colonists were selfish, cruel, and demanding. I won't finish this book unless I run out of reading material."
4,Nice Night Scope,"I bought this scope out of curiosity rather than any pratical need. This scope works well as advertised. However, be aware that this scope is the type that needs a little bit of light or Infrared light and it magnifies the light many times and display the image on a green scope. It cannot see in total drakness, and it does not detect infrared radiation emitted by body heat or other sources (That type cost over a thousand dollars).Living in the city, I have not found many uses for this device yet. But I imagine that it would be great for camping or other outdoor night time activities."
5,Unconventional,"This is not what one thinks of as Rockabilly, but if one keeps an open mind it is a very rewarding CD. It's more of a blend of Rockabilly and Weestern Swing with a bit of an edge. I love to play it loud when I'm making chilli."
5,Excellent! Research info that Everyone can understand,"I own an Herb Shop in West Chicago, Illinois. Finally, someonehas come out with information that the average person can understand. I tell my customers to read this book, so they will get reliable information about natural food supplements and herbs. There is such a fear out there, still, about these products and there shouldn't be. Herbs, vitamins and minerals, etc. are FOOD, not drugs. People should be as leary about the drugs their doctors prescribe for them as they are about herbs, etc. Hopefully this book will be read by Millions of AMERICANS and they can lay their fears to rest."
5,Glad I bought this book,"I am please to have bought this book. I take medication only when absolutely necessary, otherwise I use herbs, vitamins or natural remedies. This book is of exceptional help to me."
5,Everyone should have this book,What a great book. I learned so much and have recommended alot of the info I learned to not only friends and family but also clients of mine. I think everyone who either has health issues or knows someone that does should read this book.
4,Miracle Cures,Good reference if used in conjunction with M.D. advice. Even herbs can kill you or make you sick if you aren't careful.
3,WAY too limited in scope,"This book is good but it is extremely limited in scope. Should be at least four times the length (which could easily be done with smaller type and better design). This book covers very, VERY few herbs, vitamins, and minerals. It could be a good-sized pamphlet instead of a hardbound book."
3,Dangerous!,"This book is dangerous! Couple this with Troudeau's scam and you have a society who will substitute the healing powers of herbs for the lab versions of drugs. Allopathic theory of ""symptom-Cure"" written in the context of alternative health could very well lead to death. Herbs are medicine, the original medicine, and to tout them as miracle ""cures"" which will invariably cause people, especially Americans, to rush for the ""miracle,"" can be deadly. Noone should be on medicine or medicications for any length of time, and we certainly should be at a more advanced stage by now to recognize that ANY book that suggests miracle cures is written only for profit, not for the knowledge it imparts. Gangi's book, ""Forget The Cures, Find The Cause,"" was written to combat Troudeau's scam. I believe her book should have superceded this one as well."
3,Decent Mouse,"It is a decent mouse, I like the weight of it and cursor speed. However it gets shaky at times and gets really annoying when trying to click on a specific small point. For being a Razor mouse I did have higher expectations."
3,Less than portrayed,"Got this 3 weeks ago and although it is fast the side bars [forward and reverse{L&R}] are dummies and misrepresented. Scroll bar is rough and clunky so whats left? This mouse would be ok in the $11-16 range as Logitec has much better and Laser for 1/2 the price. If it didnt cost so much to send it back I would. Buy A logitec, best mouse on the market-I have 3...Steve a"
3,Get the Leatherman Pulse instead,"The Leatherman(tm) Pulse is the replacement for the PST II. It has the same tools but they all lock. Also the handles have been curved so that they don't pinch your hand when you bear down on the pliers. Why are locking tools important? Well when you use the screwdriver it won't close on your thumb (caught me).On the downside, the Pulse is slightly bigger than the PST, because of the wider handle, but you are going to carry it on your belt you won't notice the difference. Plus the thumb lock requires some finger strength but if you can open the blades you can probably roll the thumb lock to close them.The PST II, is an improvement over the PST, and the Pulse is an improvement over the PST II."
2,too expensive,"i bought a similar stainless multi-tool at wal-mart for $6!!! the knives aren't near as sharp, but it does have a better wrench. also have a wenger.... great quality but expensive."
3,Average.,"I have purchased this authors book and cards titled The Way of Cartouche. The book and cards I find are excellent. If you are one who is interested in Tarot, I Ching, Runes etc. You will find this book and cards very helpful. In regards to the book titled Practical Techniques of Psychic Self-Defense its not worth buying. Very limited information. There are other books on the subject which are far more informative.ThanK You."
3,Reflexión de los principios cristianos en la época actual,"Con el script de uno de los cuatro evangelios, Vicente Leñero recrea en el México actual el acontecer del lider espiritual que va encontrando a sus seguidores en los estratos más modestos del país. La circunstancia histórica revive los acontecimientos bíblicos adaptándolos al país México y a la época, los 70's. Profunda reflexión de la atemporalidad de los principios cristianos."
5,LOve this CD,"Well..what happend was my friend george got this cd..i dont know where from,but he got it from somewhere,and i listend to it..i got really attached to it. i Did not hear it for like a year after that.Then i came across it again,and got it for myself,its a great cd..nice euro Beat,if u like Solid Base,or E-Type or any kind of Euro music,you will love this cd"
5,White teacher,Used this for a college class! Great book! Paley was very ahead of her time in dealing with multi-cultural issues in early childhood education settings.
3,"Poor Representative, But A Good Book","As a Jewish teacher in a multicultural classroom, I had problems reading this book. While Paley never claims she is speaking from a Jewish perspective, she often refers to it. That is not a problem, except that she tends to portray Jews in a bad light. What saves Paley and this book is that it was written in '79, years before our lives became ""politically correct."" Paley is often brutally honest about her experiences, and for that, I take my hat off to her."
3,"An interesting topic, but not much depth","A mildly interesting read about one educator's experiences with race in the classroom. The book might have flowed better if the vignettes didn't seem so disjointed and the author didn't waver between discussing cultural issues in the classroom and the importance of play in kindergarten. I might recommend this one to those in the teaching profession interested in reflecting upon race issues in classrooms, but be forewarned that it is not the most well-written or organized book, but it is a quick read. To me, this book only glosses the surface of the issues dealing with race, ethnicity, and culture teachers face."
3,Interesting and informative,This was a very interesting and informative book about a Jewish teacher who goes to teach poor minority children and must learn to identify with them. Probably good for teachers in this situation. The stories of Paley's students are interesting
5,An exciting addition to a great series!,"Lisanne Norman's Sholan series is one of the most engrossing I have ever read. Dark Nadir is just as engrossing as the rest of the series. It has a huge cast of characters with multiple and complex plot lines. Often in a book with that many characters, I have a few favorites and get frustrated when they arn't the focus and read quickly ahead to get back to them. All of Norman's characters are interesting and involving. I didn't even mind that so much of this book was not focused on the orignal characters of Carrie and Kusac. For great characters and world building as well as lots of romance and adventure, I highly recommend the Sholan series. I will be waiting anxiously for the next installment!"
4,Love these shows!,My son loves Mythbusters but rarely sees it anymore. This was a great treat to be able to own some of the episodes and get to watch whenever he can! Definitely will be adding to the collection with the other videos that are available!
5,Absolutely the best price,I have searched locally and over the Internet for this type of light set up I found same setup costing $[...] and up. I was surprised and shocked to find this light set up for under $[...] on [...]. This deal is so good I purchased three more of a similar set on Amazon.
5,manumission 1996,"clearing out some junk the other day and came across a cassettefeaturing dj griff @ manumission in 1996.the main track was tha wildstyle which id forgotten about.tape is quite fuzzy so now looking to buy that particular track on the net,not much success as yet.hope to find it soon though,would love to hear it properly againgdh"
4,An Excellent Werewolf Resource,"This book is extremely helpful, especially to new players of Werewolf: The Apocalypse. It adds a lot to the game, including a variety of new merits and flaws, extra rites and gifts, and detailed information about the changing breeds other than the garou. A must-have for any player."
3,Needs a little work,"I do not think that this second edition version is all it cold have been. It is still missing some vital information, such as auspice statistics for the naga. Some of the art is less impressive than the first edition as well. Overal though it is an improvment on the first edition."
1,worst mosquito spray ever!,"Wasted $14 on 2 cans of this OFF. My child got 35+ mosquito bites on his legs and arms during football practice, after using this spray!"
3,Some Interesting Dirt on Gerald and Alex,"If you are looking for a Wicca 101 course, or and in-depth history of Wiccan practice, cruise on by. This small tome covers nothing in any detail. It does, however, provide a deliciously personal look at some of the founding members of the British Wiccan movement, from someone who was there. If you've ever wondered what Gerald, Alex, or Doreen were really like, Fifty Years of Wicca is worth your dough and your time."
5,Excellent!,"I am not afraid to say that I love this book. It is so easy to read and Fred Lamond is wonderfully insightful. He is one of the original members of Gardner's coven and this book takes the reader on a personal journey that charts his life in Wicca and his relationship with the divine. He gives great opinions on magic and Wiccan practice, as well as an insiders view of the development of Wicca from the beginning to now, along with some interesting memories concerning its key movers and shakers.I would recommend this book to anyone that wants a genuine insight into Wicca."
4,Stonishing view,"a deep and personal view of 50 Y of practice of wicca, from a person with deep knowledge, practice and very close to the reconstruct of wicca and it rebuilder, Gerald Gardner, the best record ever of events and history. very useful, very deep, with a lot of clues and tips. a must to sincere seekers."
1,Deluxe Console,Very cheap made product. The packaging was better quality than this product. The hinge broke off before I even got it installed in my vehicle. Save your money and buy a better quality product.
5,EIGHT WONDERFUL HANUKKAH STORIES - ONE FOR EACH NIGHT,"While the real city of Chelm is in Poland, the Chelm of Jewish legend could be almost anywhere - it is the traditional town of fools. But, as is the case with many fools, they're often wiser than we realize. After all, when dreidel is played in Chelm everyone wins!Caldecott Honoree Kimmel has created eight hilarious Hanukkah stories filled with memorable characters such as Monke Fool, and Feivel Bonehead. Add the smile-provoking, colorful illustrations of Mordicai Gerstein and you have a book that is both spirited and poignant - very much like Hanukkah itself."
3,"Not the best Little Critter, or the best new baby book","This book was clearly written in a different time. Apparently, the only warning that Little Critter had that he was getting a new sister was on the *day she came home*. That's not realistic to how most children today are raised!It does show a normal, if somewhat idealized reaction to a new baby - Little Critter can't show her his favorite toys, but he *can* let her pull his finger.I was a little disappointed to see the presumably newborn baby left alone in a crib with a bottle - my nieces were always held when fed."
3,Pretty good,"Enjoyed the ideas for how big sibling can interact w/new baby.My 2-yr old wasn't impressed though, and is still too physically rough to do the suggestions, which are more for an infant + big sibling than a newborn + 2 yr old."
4,Like these books,I've liked the little critter books since I was young. This has been a fun book and it makes my son giggle as we're preparing for his first sibling to arrive.
4,Great book for a new big sis/bro,I purchased a few books for friends that already had young children but were expecting new arrivals. This was a great one and I highly recommend it!
5,my family,this is a great book to read to kids since my son is going to be a big brother he cant wait
5,cute book,great book for a new baby on the way my little one loved it and i am a big fan of litle critter so it was very pleased with the book
5,Awesome Book for an only child!!,"My daughter is 2 years old we are expecting another baby soon and i thought it would be a good idea to get her some big sister books, i spent hours online trying to find something that would hit her on her age level and make her understand i got a few but this one she loves!! she reads it about 5 times a day and although i know she doesn't get the full concept of a new baby at her age this book certainly helps let her see that others have new babies coming too.. Its a must have short and to the point for any one out there with a younger child!!"
4,Cute Book,"My daughter likes this book, but it's really written for a boy who is getting a baby sister. Even though the genders are wrong, my daughter still enjoys it, and it sends a great message that baby's get a lot of attention, but they are really something special in your life."
4,Really Cute!,"My 2 1/2 year old son really enjoys this book. I think it has helped him understand what it will be like to have a baby in the house. I thought it was really cute. The only thing I thought the book didn't really address was the fact that the older child will be getting less attention after baby comes. It would have been nice to have a page showing the older child playing on his own while Mommy changes baby's diaper or feeds baby. Other than that, a really cute book!"
2,not suitable for children over about 2..,If your child is over 2 or 3 MAXIMUM.. this is super babyish.. Not appropriate for my 4 year old and we looked at it ONCE.
2,Not the best to prepare a toddler/preschooler for a new sibling,"I really like most of the other Mercer Mayer books I've read, but I didn't like this one. It left me saying ""Critter babies may be able to do that, but I will be a long time before your sister will."" For example. it shows her holding her own bottle, and holding her head up during tummy time. The time it will take a human baby to learn to do that will seem like forever to a two- or three-year-old. I also didn't like that it encourages Little Critter to let her grab his nose. I don't want uncoordinated hands with possibly sharp nails near big brother's eyes. This baby cries or ignores when Little Critter makes faces, tells jokes, and shows her picture books, and while I agree that babies won't always be up for that, I think that kind of attention is worth a try. My favorite book for siblings-to-be isI'm a Big BrotherorI'm a Big Sisterby Joanna Cole."
3,Sisters from the begining,I bought this book for a friend because she is due in June with her second child and her daughter is three years old and very excited about the new baby coming. She really enjoyed the book and loves getting ready to help with the new baby.
2,Not the usual Little Critter book,"I bought this book for my 2-year-old before we brought baby #2 home from the hospital. It's a cute book, as all Little Critter books are, but it lacks the substance and creativity in the other books."
2,Just OK,This book is just OK. A little odd and not that well written. Not really valuable in preparing a little one to become an older sib.
5,Little Critter is great,I loved these books as a kid so I had to get it for my daughter. I was so glad she loved it too.
2,"Clunky, and old-fashioned, but still fun","I purchased this game after playing the far superior Freedom Force, and while that game runs rings around this one, Hero X is still entertaining in a retro way. Unfortunately, the game isn't very stable, even on a state of the art machine, and I frequently encountered problems with crashes, scrambled backrounds, and saved games that failed to load. That said, when the game did work, it was fun, if repetitive. Not much of a challenge. For real superheroic bang for your buck, hunt down Freedom Force instead."
2,A cheap copy...,"I played Freedom Force(FF), and then bought this game thinking that would be a good continuation for FF, but after a couple minutes playing, I hated myself for spending money in a cheap pourly made copy of Fredom Force.If you want to really have fun playing super heroes game, I think you should buy FF, much better than Hero X and worth every penny!"
3,This is Adult Comedy,B&B are made for adult humor. The previous person that made comments to the effect that they are showing our kids what true role models people have in the US can stay in Canada and freeze their feable mind away. Or better yet move to China and what the Commie Channel.
2,Repulsive,"Beavis and Butthead go through their moronic routine and don't score. In response to the guy from Canada, go to small towns where people work hard and go to church and the people are honest, decent folk and you'll understand that the B&B culture is only in the cities like NY, LA. In the small towns life is still genuine."
1,the worst model for a generation,"A decade ago the role model for kids were the Super Heros....fantastic caracters fithing the evil for a good cause. Today, the heros are two drop-out swearing there way aroud, giggiling like idiot about everything and nothing...that is one more reason why the USA are what they are Today WHY??? Because you become what you see everyday. And that is what the growing generation see everyday. ...USA is a scary place to live with a dark future...the worst is to come.Thank god I'am Canadian...and I will leave soon the US. What a fake dream and a messy place"
4,Good table and chairs for the price,"So far the table is holding up nicely to our 2 year old and it was easy to put together. We did have to send the first table/chairs back to Amazon due to a couple of paint defects, but the return process was simple and I had a new table/chairs within 3 days. I would buy this product or other products from KidKraft again."
3,I should have paid more attention.,"The table is of good quality, well made and easy to put together. Many of the reviews mentioned that the chairs were too small. I thought : how small can they be? Answer, so small that the set won't be useful for very long at all. Maybe a two or three year old will be comfortable. I wish the mfr would listen to customer input and offer a larger chair. I would have been willing to pay more for something more useful. For its size, and limited use, I don't think it was worth the money."
5,Great working space for the little fingers...,"We got this set yesterday and we are so happy with it. Quality is great, it is solid wood, very stable. It took my husband 15 min to put together. My 2.5 year old son loved it and wanted to eat and play at the table for the rest of the evening. I highly recommend it , and can't beet the price I paid $89.99."
5,Good Quality Table and Chairs,"We found this set easy to assemble, and so far it has faired well under the abuse of our 3 year old. The table cleans up well after meals. The chairs are a bit slippery on the kitchen floor and are heavy due to their wood composition, but after a few spills our son got the hang of using them. All in all, a good buy."
5,The perfect size,"I purchased this table for my five and three year old boys. They love it and so do I! They do everything at this table from schoolwork to playing playdough. The things that pleased me are the size( not too big, not too small) and the durability. They feel very sturdy and have held up exceedingly well so far. They are tipped over a lot,knocked over, dragged across the kitchen a hundred times a day and I even use them for foot stools!Overall, I'm very happy with them."
5,Wonderful table!,"We were looking for a small table for our 16 month old son, that was also a nice piece of furniture. This table fits the bill. It's sturdy, solid hard-wood. Best of all, it's beautiful and durable. Our son was about 32"" tall when we got this table. He can sit at it comfortably now, but has plenty of room to grow. We can also sit beside him in the other chair and color or read with him. Our son will frequently sit across the table from one of his buddies and have dinner on it too. He absolutely loves this table (as do we)."
5,kidcraft table set,Its beautiful. My grandson eats and does crafts on it everyday. It was easy to assemble and came so quickly. I was so happy with it and that it made my grandson so happy too. Its like a real piece of furniture but really sturdy for play.
5,ASPEN TABLE AND TWO CHAIR SET,"perfect for granddaughter ! again, wanted her to have it now as she has outgrown DORA - and this with the new double stroller is a perfect fit for her room ! it's really white, sturdy, classy looking, and perfect for her - she is 5 and it will last for a few years i'm sure. definitely would say BUYIT ! LOVELOVELOVE IT !PAM AND GRANDDAUGHTER CAROLINE"
5,Perfect set!,"I was looking for a table and chairs that my 2 year old grandson would be able to use now and in the future. After searching for hours and checking measurements I decided on this one. We were very pleased with this purchase. The table and chairs were quick and easy to assemble. They are very sturdy, (he made Grandpa set in the extra chair!)and durable. Very pleased with this set."
2,pretty disappointed,I bought this table for my kids for Christmas. I was really excited to get it but wish I would have opened it before Christmas eve when my husband put it together. after he has it fully put together and set up under the tree I noticed the top of the table was cracked in more than one place and one of the chairs was missing a piece to the back of it. I really like the look of the table but the flaws bother me a lot. I don't want to waste the time to send it back and wait on another but I just wanted to give others a heads up.
4,kidcraft Aspen Table and chairs,I would recommend this product to other parents. The table and chairs are easy to put together. The finish is durable and easy to clean.
5,Perfect table for my 2 year old,"I purchased this table for my son's 2nd birthday, and we love it! My neice has had the same one in white for 2 years now, and it is still going strong. My son loves sitting at it to color, read, or have a snack. He feels super cool sitting at his own table. The packaging was fine when it arrived (early!), and all of the parts were there. It was pretty easy to assemble, except that the screws were really tight. Follow the instructions to dip the screws into dish soap, and if you can use a ratchet wrench. It will save you a ton of time, and your thumbs won't hurt from turning the tiny wrench they give you a million times. Once it was together, it is extremely sturdy! Yay! I haven't had to clean crayon off of it yet, so I don't know how ""cleanable"" it is yet."
3,Arrived in rough shape,"All the pieces seemed to be scratched, cracked, or damaged in some way or another when the set arrived. -But if you get a good set, I'd imagine it to be a good thing. The size is great for my 2-yr-old and even fits her 5-yr old friends, though I think a set a little larger might have been smarter. The idea of getting little ones their own table set is awesome and allows for crafts and snacks to be such a different experience than always using a highchair."
4,aspen Table and chair Set,"perfect.... nice, very nice wood, easy to put together------ nice piece of furniture for children! My granddaughter is 4 and it is perfect for her!"
3,Nice table and chairs,I ordered this for my granddaughter. When my daughter opened it she saw a crack so it was exchanged for a new one. The second one came and my son-in-law put it together and THEN noticed the crack. They kept it but i would think they all must have cracks.
3,"Ugly, yes. But still beats the heck out of plastic.","For the price, you can't expect perfection. The edges were average for new tools, about 3 or 4 minutes each with the sandpaper and surface plate, they would shave. The handles took a little more time,but after making a jig to hold them in my lathe, about five minutes each with sandpaper removed enough of the varnish to hand rub a tung oil finish that will be comfortable to hold for years. All in all a good buy to put in the traveling toolbox."
3,Nothing more than what you pay for,First let me tell you what happened to me when I received the item ...A fuse was broken and a cable was missing ... the only way I could get that fixed is ship it back to Amazon. Bad business. The other way would be for me to send the cable assembly to them and wait for them to send one back to me.The radio fit perfect in my Isuzu Rodeo with no problems after I got the new fuse and attached a cable ...There is no screen saver and the wallpaper on the device is TERRIBLE! If you want that stereo to look good you need to download music videos because if you leave it on radio or the CD Player it look AWFUL.The quality of the screen is great though so I can't complain about that ... the touch screen is a bit unresponsive but oh well ...If you can dish out a bit more money I recommend going somewhere else ...
5,Great Product,"This is a great product, great sound, great view, We are really happy with it. I highly recomend this purchase"
4,More Bling,"Adds a more show look to the bike. It was very easy to put the pieces on, just make sure to trial fit and clean the area before applying."
4,Saucier's apprentice,If you like to cook and are interested in different sauces.this is a great buy!!!
2,The Book of Creation,"Of all the Newell books I have read, I did NOT like this one. Poor read. Too many inserted quotes from too many other writers."
3,They were okay.,The chocolates were a lot more dry than I remember from having them a few years ago. They were still good though.
1,Dude voice is annoying!!!,"I got this movie, but couldn't watch it because of the main characters annoying voice. It's like an extremely scratchy whisper. Could have been a good movie if he would talk like a normal person."
3,Standard..,"I got this opener for just because I like the keychain idea, and I hated the bulky ones you put on the visor. Easy to install, held up to a few drops, just wasnt impressed with the range. Had to be in the driveway to hit the button. Personally I like to just drive in once I make it to the house. Went back to the bulky visor opener."
2,works from 4 feet away......,"The device works great after you set the proper code for your garage door opener. But just be aware that this only works from no more than 6 feet away. If you are planning to open the door sitting in your car, this is not the product. I step out of my car and walk close to the door to catch the signal.... I find it useless."
3,A good bang for your buck,I found this to be a fairly good buy. The first cd is very good. The second wears thin with what seems to be a lot of filler. I'd go for it.
3,Concise but confusing,"Soundings is a good book with a great many examples and a great deal of information, but the format often leaves the reader in quite a quandry, as the author titles a chapter ""Alan Berg Before Wozzeck,"" and the reader expects such. Then the author goes on to talk about Berg, but keeps referring back to Webern and Mahler and Schoenberg, and the reader at many points is left wondering exactly who this piece of music and that particular quote is by. Once again, much information in a format lacking in organization."
5,Amazing text,This book is extremely full of information and very detailed. Lots of primary sources and makes an excellent college text book.
2,"Not a ""universal"" thermostat","I wanted new thermostats with the auto season change, since I was getting tired of flipping the heat-cool switch so often, or coming home to a freezing house when the switch was left in the cool position when the a/c was needed the previous day. This thermostat has all the features, but is only compatible with heat pumps. The Hunter site and Amazon don't give a lot of info on this, I found out when I opened the box (can't return that one) and read the manual. My local Lowe's had a great compatibility chart, I ultimately installed programmable ""universal"" models from Honeywell with the season changeover feature. I will eventually upgrade my current system to a heat pump, this way I can use the same thermostats."
4,A little pricey but works well,"I bought this thermostat a couple of weeks ago; it has been working well so far and has plenty of bells and whistles. Installation was fairly straight-forward; the instructions were a bit unclear, but one call to their support staff took care of that problem. This unit seems pricy when compared to other thermostats, but it was the only one that I could find for a multi-state heat pump system. But since I was able to install it myself, and it has been working well since then, I'm not particularly unhappy about the price."
5,"16"" Super Saiyan Goku in my opinion!","One of the coolest DragonBall Z things I own (and I own alot). Goku is very durable and sturdy. He looks as if he came right out of the show. I would reccomend it to any devoted DBZ fan. I look forward to collecting all of the 16"" figurines."
3,Dated Story,I bought this because it was the selection for a bookgroup I'm in. It is a bit dated. I'm not moved to read anymore of her books.
2,Ugh,"I am at a loss for words for how absurd this was. Not over the top enough to be camp, but this story line should be. Dreadful actors playing dreadful characters dreadfully. Stupid plot points, closted politician in a gay B&D secret society BS, parades his bitchy shallow BF around all over town. There are stupid twists, boy goes to a doctor and gets mystery treatments that keep him young, which serves a stupid purpose near the end. Actually at a later time in the film he's the only one that actually looks different. It seems to be some half baked attempt to be a Ken Russel or David Lynch film. Maybe it was daring when it got made, but it's dumb by today's standards."
2,Weird and disjointed,"For me, this movie just didn't do it. The story was too loose and none of the characters were really likable at all. I'm American--Perhaps this movie is more interesting if you're Australian and understand the country culture and the treatment of gay people through the history of the country better?"
2,Celtic? Nah,"What a lovely book this is, full of happy blond children lavishly photographed amidst charmingly rustic settings. However, the knitwear they're modeling, although clean-lined and attractive, isn't ""Celtic"" at all. Yes, there is one Aran-ish tunic in the collection, but unless you are a thirteen-year-old, it won't fit you. A terrific disappointment!"
2,not inspirational,"This book is geared more towards the beginner, as the variety and patterns in this book are not really inspirational to more experienced knitters. This is quite a let down of a book, although there are a few pieces I may someday knit."
5,Debbie Bliss,"Nice book,it wasnt used at all. Fast deelevery and very cheap.I will by from theme again.They have so many books to choose from."
3,Limited,"I was surprised to see that some of the adult patterns in this book contained instructions for only one size (34)! I've been knitting off and on for 46+ years and don't find it easy to extrapolate to different sizes - if a pattern doesn't go anywhere near my size, I will be moving on to something else. There are also patterns in the book that have TWO sizes (small and medium, in effect). Yippee skippy! It's pretty well known that these days most of us corn (syrup)- fed Americans are overweight, so why publish patterns just for models?The kiddie patterns are very cute and also appear practical -- if I were going to make anything from this book, it would be a children's sweater or two."
5,VillaWare 12-inch Electric Skillet Nonstick,"This VillaWare skillet is a ""must have"" for everyone. I love VillaWare products and have had a VillaWare Waffle Iron for over 15-years and it still looks good and cooks as it first did. I would definately give this Skillet to family and friends as a gift and I will be purchasing a second one for my kitchen. It cooks evenly and keeps foods warm until time to serve. Easy to clean and store. Love it !!"
4,Indispensable!,"Speeds up your work in superb way. . Great for installing hinges or anything you want to center the hole in. It only takes a second to flip the cartridge and drive the screw. The only problem is that it's kind of expensive and they give your three different sized bits. The problem with the different sized bits is that each one comes with a different sized philips head. Most everything I drive is a #2 size - it would have been nice to keep that consistent and change just the drill bit. Because of this, two of the three bits will likely go unused."
1,Crap - Regurgitation of the Hibernate.org Docs,"This is one of the worst introductions to any Java technology I have ever read. More of an API reference than a guide. The author shows a few open source tools for generating objects and DB schemas, then revisits all the info in the Hibernate docs and tutorial. Don't waste your money like I did."
3,Doesn't cover standard way of working with Hibernate,"After the introduction, the book starts by explaining how to write Hibernate mapping files and use a Hibernate specific ANT task to generate Java source.It the next chapter, the book explains how to generate Hibernate XML mapping files from XDoclet tags in the Java code.The third chapter explains how to generate both the mapping files and Java source from a DB schema by using a tool called Middlegen.I think a better approach would have been to have a chapter explaining how to develop everything from scratch (Java source and XML mapping files), then move on to tools that make your job easier by generating the schema, mapping files and/or the Java source.Also, the book covers Hibernate 2. Hibernate 3 is already out, although, to be fair, there are no Hibernate 3 books in the market yet and most of the tools that integrate with Hibernate (XDoclet, Middlegen, etc) still generate Hibernate 2 artifacts, however, I expect this to change soon."
2,Too much code,"I bought both this book and Hibernate in Action. Hibernate in Action is much better. This book is less informative and devotes far too much space to source code instead of explanation, insight and tips. I don't recommend this book, as there are better alternatives."
2,Could be better,"This book is lacking alot of infor even thought it full of other infor. However, everything I went to look up was not in this book."
3,cleanly executed chant with a Christ-based theme,"A strange CD with the photo of the main tenor on the cover, but this is a pretty straight if fairly generic Gregorian chant CD. It is arranged thematically based on Christ the King, although the chants picked for the various aspects of that Divine Kingship are at times questionable matches. I have hundreds of chant discs and thousands of chant tracks, so few if any new chants discovered here, but it was a great buy used, so it was just worth it."
1,Unpleasant music,Purchasing this CD was a mistake; I should have listened more carefully to the samples. These songs have a an ugly and unpleasant sound that I can't get used to. I have decided to give the CD to the library. Don't buy it.
1,Half-hearted effort at full price,"A series that seemed exciting and essential when it started in 2000 now just looks like a half-hearted franchise looking for a new owner. Da Capo have downsized these volumes each year, and at less than 200 pages, this is the thinnest yet. JT Leroy's selections are lazy and predictable, with none of the big names featured being represented by compelling, innovative work. Robert Christgau is typically verbose and incoherent on minstrelsy, and Ingrid Sischy's conversation with Camille Paglia is banal. Tributes by David Ritz (on Ray Charles), Greil Marcus (on Buddy Holly) and Tom Roche (on John Peel) are heartfelt straight reportage, while other pieces are mere news items. Every day the web shows the literary sub-genre of music writing is healthier than ever; other than cost-cutting, there is no excuse for this showpiece anthology to be so lame and lacking in vitality."
2,What was De Capo thinking?,"And the hoax of J.T. Leroy was asked to be editor because...?Maybe next time around De Capo will return to using editors who are 1) real people, 2) respected and qualified to edit such a seemingly important collection, and 3) valued more for their insight instead of bringing someone else onboard who, regardless of whether they exist or not, is wrongly assumed to be so ultra-hip and edgy that the name alone would sell more books."
1,Throw away your money and support fraudster J.T.Leroy,"The editor of this book is forty-something Laura Albert, pathetic phone sex worker and con artist masquerading as a victimized street youth infected with HIV after being prostituted by his own mother. She knows as much about quality writing and quality music as she knows about the life in the streets, which is nothing. She selected the pieces in this collection. Enough said. Don't support liars and greedy publishers without principles."
3,Great for indoor / Terrible for outdoor,"CONS :- Be careful, use it only indoor. Dont expect to use it outdoor ! If its sunny day, you will see nothing.- You cant upload image to a FTP, you will need the new model (and more expensive) Veo Wireless Observer XT.PROS :- quite easy to install- remote function is great- nice design"
2,Not what I had expected,I was expecting a nice fluffy boppy pillow. The pillow I recieved was....small I guess. And it also lost it's shape after using it for breastfeeding for maybe a month. Could have bought a brand new pillow for the price I paid and also it would stay fluffy longer than this one.
3,Wrong brand,"The only problem i have is i passed on some cheaper deals to order a ""Reddy Heater"" brand thermostat and that is not what i recieved. I recieved an ""off"" brand, not what was described when i ordered. On the other hand , so far it seems to work ok, i just wish i would have recieved what i ordered."
5,AT LONG LAST ALAN DALE IS AVAILABLE ON CD,"At last someone has seen fit to release on CD some recordings by the great ALAN DALE. Now that the mambo is staging a comeback, it's especially timely that this disc includes Dale's classic vocal of that dance's most famous number, ""Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White"". You'll also find the song that launched the mambo's successor, the Cha Cha Cha --- Dale's record of ""Sweet and Gentle"". Most welcome, howcver, is an example of why Alan Dale was in the forefront of the post-Sinatra generation of singers, the dramatic ballad, ""I'm Sorry."" The three other singers featured here are well served by the chosen selections --- but they've been available on CD before. It's the presence of Alan Dale that makes this one special. Give it a listen, you'll be glad you did."
2,"Good John Woo Action, but Patented Characterization Missing","I would really liken this film to the Replacement Killers. Antione Fuqua had a real feel for the Hk style gunfights and editing, but that all has to be backed by good characterizations. This film was much the same way.Co directed in part by Wu Ma and John Woo (it's obvious Woo didn't write this). The plot concerns itself with the death of a head triad and the internal struggle over who will take over. There are many doublecrosses and scenes of nervous gangsters. But I really couldn't follow the film well. I have watched it twice now and I still can't remember any characters names and the causes of some of their actions.Overall, the plot is cofusing- VERY confusing. The gunplay sequences are perfectly filmed and show much of the technical skill he later had perfected in Hard boiled. one big problem in the end is a very unfunny sidekick who makes jokes (mostly slapstick uuuggghhh! )."
2,far from the best,"This film wouldn't be so bad if it had a little more characterization.I believe this movie was co-directed by Wu Ma.A lot of gun play that seems to be missing the spark that most of John Woo's films have.A little overloaded with the male bonding,and plenty of gangsters trying to look cool.All in all,it's rather unipressive,and seems more like a spoof of one of Woo's films."
1,Oh Puleaseeee...Gimme a Break,"I don't need to order this book to know it's full of ""it"". (And I don't mean information either) As a police dispatcher I know: 1. The sophistication of our radio equipment in this day makes non-LEO scans darned hard. (Helloooo...it jumps channel to channel faster that you can keep up) Just ask the newspaper folks who try.... 2. Just about every agency using code (signal codes and 10 codes) don't use the same code, so if you are scanning an agency like mine, who isn't dwelling in the dark ages, you'd better have about 200+ codes memorized *before* starting. Are you going to know what 321 10-65 signal 38 both parties 1012 means? And we fly folks. It's a fast moving pace.I hate being so negative, but I hate the idea of folks wasting money on something like this, unless it's for a good read only."
5,Acu-Yoga Designed to Relieve Stress & Tension,"You will find this and interesting book,it tells how to use accupressure along with doing yoga to relieve stress and tension."
5,Great Bio,Great bio complete with recipes you can't find in Pepin's cookbooks. A friend of mine loaned me his copy and I'm getting one myself for reference.
4,Prose as yummy as Pepin's potage,"A terrific memoir by charming, personable Jacques Pepin. It reads as fast as a proper saute, progressing from his pottering around his mother's humble cafe in the 40s, thru the nerve-wracking French apprenticeship system, to his current star-studded life as chef, TV personality, author, and dean of the French Culinary Inst. in NYC. Firmly simmered in the stew of American life now, he still straddles the Atlantic with his humor and attitudes toward food remaining decidedly French.A winner, and as a bonus you get a few recipes tossed in along the way."
4,"Great story, but problems with Kindle edition","5 STARS FOR BOOK: I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I learned much more about Pepin than I knew before. For those who know him only on TV, there is much more behind his story. Anyone would enjoy this book, but especially those interested in food and cooking. I especially enjoyed his stories about working in the old French apprentice system; it's a fascinating read.4 STARS FOR KINDLE VERSION: I don't know how the printed version was transferred to Kindle (does anyone know how this works??). But there are many typos and incorrect punctuation. I never had trouble understanding what it was supposed to say, but this would seem like such an easy thing to fix. Having read the book, I'd volunteer to send in a list of corrections if I knew where and how.But don't let the typos scare you off. This was a great book that I enjoyed very much. I have a newfound appreciation for Jacques Pepin."
5,Charming and Funny,This autobiography of a chef who moves from France to America is fun and fill of French charm.
4,From Old World cooking to Nouvelle Cuisine,"Chef Jacques Pepin tells of his amazing career withgreat simplicity and succinctness. It is a powerfultale, and will interest fans of his TV series,as well as other food lovers. Pepin's knowledge of cooking,acquired the old classical way in France, as well as hislove for his work, carried him through positions in thegreatest restaurants and highest levels of service. Hecooked for General DeGaulle and his family, a happypost, and for the tyrannical Henri Soule of Le Pavillion,an unhappy position. A real page turner! One small caveat:why oh why were those recipes inserted between chapters ofthe narrative? After reading of his near fatal accident, onefinds a fondue recipe on the following pages, preceding theoutcome of his condition."
5,Incredible life story and surprisingly well-written.,"What an amazing life story. Not a moment of this book was boring or uninteresting and it was surprisingly well-written, witty and insightful. Pepin's story is inspiring. It shows that if you are dedicated and willing to work hard, you can achieve almost greatness.This book is not necessarily for ""foodies."" I think most people would enjoy reading it. Not only does Pepin have talent as a Chef, he is a talented writer as well."
4,"One of the best ""food"" books I've ever read","I actually ordered this book on a whim, after seeing it mentioned in Bourdain's ""Les Halles Cookbook"" (another excellent title). I just received it 3 days ago and have almost finished it! This is a great book. Pepin's life is interesting, exciting, and full of lucky circumstances. I really enjoyed reading about his childhood growing up in France and his arrival in America.Pepin is also very witty and funny (at times making me laugh out loud during my commute, which illicited several curious stares from other CTA passengers!), with a certain french charm. The recipes are also look very good and there are several I'm planning to make.My only problem with this book (and why I didn't give it 5 stars) is because it was too short! I really wanted it to be longer and for Pepin to go into more detail. But, other than that, it's an excellent book."
5,Different Than I Expected,"Pepin has to be the least arrogant French chef that ever lived. Matter of fact, it appears that he hasn't an arrogant bone in his body. I found it fascinating that he came to America and immediately appreciated the simplicity of our ""cuisine."" There are some great sounding recipes in here (no I have not tried one yet) some from his earliest memories as a child from his mother. I planned on renting this from the library but glad that I bought it. A couple criticisms 1. I wished he would have talked about Julia Child more 2. The book kind of abruptly ends. Would have been nice for him to sum it up, where he thinks his career is headed, what he thinks about ""modernist"" cooking and the future of it. But I realize that isn't his style, he seems a very low key non-opinionated type man that appreciates simplicity. A great read."
2,Disappointing,"Jacque Pepin's cooking program is beloved in our household for many years. I looked forward to reading his autobiography. I was disappointed in his book-- his writing sounds like a guy trying to show how cute he was/is from the time he was 6 years old-- and look at the photos included in the book-- My, what a handsome guy! We love his tv program for the depth of his knowledge, his patience in teaching cooking processes-- but in his book he comes across as a shallow person. Don't think that's what he is."
2,Where's the beef!?,"It was an enjoyable lite read. The recipes after each chapter were interesting.But, it is written on a sixth-grade level, so it's not something I'll reread. A lot more could have gone into each of the stories.I wouldn't recommend buying the book, but check it out of the library if they have it."
3,Good if you want a quick summary of the book,"I was hoping for something that was more of a study guide that could be used in a Sunday school class setting. This is more of a condensed version of the book, almost a Mere Christianity mini version. It does have some interesting side notes."
3,Not what you might think,"This is not Mere Christianity. I returned the twelve I bought. I did not look at it, so I cannot say if it is a good study guide to work with a group study. I just want you to know that it is not the book itself.I highly recommend Mere Christianity to everyone. It is by far the best treatise for understanding basic Christianity. It is an easy and fast read. Sometimes a bit difficult to understand these concepts, but let's face it, Christianity is a bit difficult."
2,Not the Classic Book,"There's nothing ""wrong"" with the ""Shepherd's Notes"", but I thought I was buying an annotated copy of the C.S. Lewis classic, ""Mere Christianity"" (which I love); instead I got a ""Cliff Notes"" overview. My bad."
1,Deceitful name on the front cover,"This book is not MERE CHRISTIANITY at all and should never be sold as such. I ordered several copies for my mentor group in prison and have to have them shipped directly from Amazon to the inmate in order for them to actually recieve the book so getting them returned is impossible. My intent was to have a study of the real book and not someone else's view of the book.Once I figured out the book was not what it was being sold as I had to reorder and have the real MERE CHRISTIANITY shipped next day to get them to the inmates on time which cost me a bundle. Typically people who do prison ministry do not have a ""bundle"" to spend so I had to bite the bullet on that one and I am very displeased with the publisher as I view the naming of the book and the front cover as being very deceitful. I am sure they made their bundle by selling it that way."
2,Debes tener el libro,"Es como una guía para que vayas entendiendo el libro, si no lo tienes o pretendes leer esto en lugar del libro, pierdes tu tiempo."
3,WARNING,"Congratulations! If you are reading this, you are a more responsible buyer than me. Already knowing that I wanted to buy Mere Christianity, I did not bother to read the description or any reviews. After all, ""C.S. Lewis's Mere Christianity"" is on the cover in the picture for this item twice. I just assumed Shepard's Notes was the publisher. WRONG! It seems that Shepard's Notes are pretty much Cliff Notes. If you are looking for Lewis's text, keep looking!"
1,NOT CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT THE ACTUAL BOOK,"I ordered this thinking it would be the actual book Mere Christianity. Much to my disappointment I received some sort of cliffnote-esque walkthrough of the book instead, called Shepherd's Notes. While it said Shepherd's notes in the title, I just assumed that was part of the ACTUAL book title since the author said CS Lewis. CS Lewis did not actually write this Shepherd's Notes version, which the description said he did. All in all this book might be helpful if I actually had wanted it? However I can't use it because I didn't get the actual book yet. And returning it would cost just as much as it did to buy it."
4,mere christianity,I found this title very interesting and thought provoking. I would recommend this to anyone who interested in knowing more about the Christian religion.
4,mere christianity shepherd's notes review,"this is a very good cliffnotes-type summary of the sheperd's notes ""version"" of this famous cs lewis book. although a summary, it is fairly comprehensive and accurate."
3,I ought to look closer,"I thought I was buying the book ""Mere Christianity"" by C. S. Lewis.What I ended up with was somebody's notes on the book.I was disappointed and thought I ought to mention it, in case I am able to warn someone about to make the same mistake.This IS NOT a review of this book, just a rant on my lack of observation skills."
2,Frontier Doctor,"This book looked good, but I believe many of the author's stores are lies. He just made them up. I say this because I've read extensively about the West and its characters and know many things could not have happened. For instance, the author claimed he knew Billy the Kid and Billy and Jesse James were friends, and he saw them together. Bull. I'm using the polite form of this word."
3,bra,"This product came in a timely fashion and in brand new condition. I originally bought it to go under a strapless wedding dress. It works just fine the only complaint i have about it is that the real product is not as pretty or flattering as the picture shows. The bra is not shimmery and the cups are not rounded like the picture.If you need this to go under a strapless, garment that will completely cover the bra and is of a fabric that is fairly thick or layered this product will be perfect for you."
3,There was potential here...,"A spotty attempt to transcribe Williams' orchestral score down to a jazz combo. Oscar Peterson succeded with ""West Side Story"", but Bernstein's score was rooted in jazz anyway. I think Trotter played it safe here. The Main Theme is pretty much what you'd expect. Princess Lea's Theme does work as a sax ballad, and the Ewok tune (done like upbeat Art Tatum) is catchy but ends up sounding like the original Sesame Street Theme.Trotter TOTALLY blows it with the Cantina Band Theme. I mean, here's the one piece that really lends itself to jazz exploration and Trotter does almost nothing interesting with it. The one true success is May the Force Be with You... arranged as a solo piano piece, it has a yearning tone-poem quality you would not expect from the original melody. If he had applied the same approach to the rest of the recording I think it could've been a good exercise in jazz arranement, rather than the novelty CD it is."
2,It's Cheesy lounge music.,Just like the tital says. It's a cheesy lounge music version of classic John Williams. I picked it up used for about $7 and still felt like I was ripped off.
3,Worked Great Until....,"I used this set for a a long time and thought it was the best thing ever, even bought it for friends and family. Over time though bits slip or break and need replacing. Tightening down with the hex screw works for awhile but eventually it just becomes too loose. The reversible bits eventually get sloppy in the locking mechanism too. Its still in my toolbox but I've upgraded to a Jack Rabbit Cabinet Maker set and it is incredible."
1,Terrible Quality,"This kit was purchased to replace an older Makita bit that I had been using frequently for almost 10 years before I lost it. This new one broke where the screw tip inserts into the bit the very first time I used it. Very cheap, very poor quality."
3,Expected more for the brand and the price,"There is quite a bit of play in the socket, so the bits will wobble. I bought an identical Ryobi-branded tool at the local big box home store, and was hoping that Makita would make a better product, but it's the same product with a different label on it.I decided to keep it and deal with the wobbliness, but I'm not all that happy about it."
5,Makita magic !,"I've had this set in my tool arsenal for many years , but never used it much until just recently. Probably because I was using the Instey bit system, which was working fine. I discovered that this is actually faster and dose as good or better than any system I've used, if you don't need to use an impact driver . You can purchase any broken drill bits or countersinks at Home Depot as well. Tips can be released with the turn of an Allen wrench on my model but maybe on a more updated model they have a quicker method. Either way it's better than a press fit,since sometimes the tip has a tendency to come out in use or be too difficult to get out for replacement on those types. And they are magnetic, which is a must."
5,Makita---always a good choice,"Makita is always a good choice for a do it yourself guy who doesn't like ""one day tools."""
3,good tent but water got in,Got the tent for a road trip in California. I wanted to test the tent against rain. I set up the tent and the rain came...not too heavy but all day long. At the end of the day I found some water inside. I'm not sure how it got there...perhaps condensation from an open vent on the site (of course I put the top rain caver on top). I assume there is no perfect tent...
3,Very good cold weather tent,"I've had this tent out a few times in snow storms and freezing temps and it held up great; shed the snow, handled the wind and stayed warm. You will get a good amount of condensation if you don't vent it a bit but it doesn't take long to figure out what it takes to stay warm and prevent condensation.Both vestibules are smallish...I wonder why Eureka! bothered with the rear vestibule since you can only access it from the outside and it's only large enough for a pair of boots.One of the door zipper stitching is beginning to come apart. Seems pretty shoddy for a tent in this price range that is only in it's second season of light use.Would give it 3.5 stars if the ratings allowed it. Eureka! should bring the price down or the quality up if they want 5 star ratings on this tent IMHO."
5,Great Rough weather backpacking tent.,This tent is great for harsh weather or any weather as long as it is set up properly(in the proper direction of wind and proper guy lines). It may not be the lightest backpacking tent but most certainly is one of the strongest. Definitely worth carrying those extra couple pounds for comfort. Vents great for hot days and insulates well for cold days without worry of condensation. Definitely a great deal and well priced.
5,"a beautiful, emotional and awesome story","This made me feel many emotions, I think the author for a beautiful story about a family struggling with traumatic memories, emotional conflict, a chemistry charged romance and the joys and sadness of life.There were amny editorial errors and perhaps things, however, Joe and Caroline's characters were so well formed, full of so much raw emotion and sparkling romantic chemistry that it made up for any flaws. This book doesn't conform - it delights. Enjoy"
3,Nice read,"I enjoyed it, but really couldn't get into it. Kept putting it down and forgetting to pick it back up again. I would recommend it as a nice read, but nothing spectacular."
4,Loved it,"I thought this book was well written, and one of those ""Can't put down"" novels. I could not wait each night to continue reading the book. Rice has a way of writting which has you feeling like you know each member of the family."
4,A GOOD BOOK FOR THE BEACH,"My first Luanne Rice book but probably not my last. A good story which unfolds slowly like a lazy summer afternoon but with just enough drama to keep you interested. A family in conflict and denial due to a couple of tragedies, one of which happens at the beginning of the story. Original plot, interesting characters, good sister story, and a nice and very unusual romance. The ending was a little too long and drawn out but other than that it's a winner."
2,Good plot idea; poor follow-through,"When I read a book, I like to become submerged in the plot, but I never was able to get beyond the glaring editorial errors and mediocre writing. A couple of examples: The Vietnamese river rat incident just about did me in...it's totally unbelievable that this vicious animal would sleep serenely all night, sharing a pillow with a young girl and two cats, and then suddenly cause the devastation which took place the next day. I also found it hard to accept that a mother would actually allow her husband to send their three young daughters into the wilds alone overnight to learn survival skills! ...And the youngest could feel snakes writhing under her tent floor? Come on!"
2,Boring and Depressing,This book is very depressing and full of violence. And so boring I didn't even finish it (which is VERY rare with me). I DON'T reccomend it.
4,Desperately Seeking,"I enjoyed this album very much. Infact, if any one can get me a copy of this album even if it is a dubb on a regular cassette tape (or the original for that matter) I would greatly appreciate it. Much blessings coming your way."
5,I have Adoration N' Prayze CDs,I've been searching for years and have finally found it the other day!!!
4,This is not that bad.,"I missed Teknoman when it originally aired in the States, but I was introduced to it via Tekkaman Blade II, and then, Wikipedia when I tried to find the original.As someone who saw a more.. shall we say, faithfully translated.. branch before I saw Teknoman, I can say that while the name changes are annoying to a point it doesn't change my enjoyment of these collections! I still want the Japanese-only subbed version (I have season 1) but I like being able to get the gist of the original story without having to wade through it all.Purists will find a lot to pick apart - heck, even I do - but I still recommend them. :)"
1,"Fall apart all the time, require constant repair.",The metal spring neck comes detached from the handle all the time. Can fly off at an unpredictable angle. There are very similar items that are less expensive and don't fall apart. The bongers are relatively easy to fix with epoxy but should come made better.
4,Easy to use,"These are really easy to use, you don't have to hit hard with them to get good effect. My husband has a back like a plank of wood and it's impossible (for me, a non-masseuse) to give him a massage that does any good. These let me help him out without fatiguing myself or giving me hand cramps... we had a ""thumper"" kind of hand-held version of this but the kickback from it made it really hard for me to use on him as I got tired very quickly. These are so much better."
4,Bonging's not what it used to be!,I really enjoy using these bongers to help loosen up my tight muscles. Works really good on my calve muscles. My cats like it too.
2,Ok product,"Not one to down a product just seems these are a bit silly and not worth 25.00 . I could have bought some cheap balls and glued them to a stick, not really loving it."
2,"Poor quality, made in China","These ""ancient Japanese"" massage tools are actually made in China. The flexible metal handles came discolored (rust?), but do not appear to be otherwise damaged. The product just looks old and used, including the rubber balls which look sloppily manufactured. I would be willing to pay $5 for these from a garage sale. I think this was a case of false advertising, and would not recommend ordering these."
3,Not bonkers over bongers,"I was on a yoga retreat when someone used these on me, she had them for a few years so maybe they were broken in.I haven't found these ase pleasurable, at least you get a pair for the price.They are better when used on you by someone else, instead of yourself and don't use too hard, I bruised myself."
5,Very good!,I bought this item as a gift for someone. I don't really know how it smells but the person had used it before and really liked it. The packaging is good- it came with the external transparent wrapping/seal. I also think the price is good for this product.
1,"""Cannot read card""","The PNY 1 GB SD card, which I purchased lasted approximately 6 minutes. Then, I received an error message ""cannot read card"". Formatting the card by the digital camera changed the error message to ""this card cannot be used"". The same message was generated by another camera - both of them worked perfectly with Kingston SD cards."
1,Would give it 0 stars...,"Do not buy this card! I had one of these PNY cards a couple months ago because they were cheap, and i needed a large card on a vacation. So i was taking apporx, 200 photos when all of sudden, all of them got deleted and my camera started saying ""Card cannot be read"". I thought it was my camera hoping that the precious ONCE IN A LIFETIME photoes were not deleted, then i brought it to a computer and a print store, no hope. So now all of my photos are gone, office depot has the worst service in the world, and there is no consumer support for PNY!I am beyond aggravated..."
1,I wish I could give less than 1 star,"This card worked for less than 10 minutes. I took a handful of pictures, plugged the camera into my computer and copied the pictures, and when I unplugged the camera I got the error message ""cannot read card"". Formatting the card did not fix the problem. When I plugged it back into the computer, the camera says ""connection failed"", and computer can't see the camera. And judging by the other reviews here, I'm not the only one to have this problem. PNY's tech support is non-existent; there's virtually no helpful information on the site, and the email I sent them was not returned. Don't waste your time and $ - PNY needs to get their act together."
1,"Bad quality, donot buy pny sd card","After using this sd card only twice, it can not be recognized by any of my card reader. Totally a waste of money and time. Do not buy pny brand!"
5,Great Memory Card,I bought this sd card for my new camera because it was the cheapest card I could find. I have had it for about a month and it is working fine so far. Great product as far as I am concerned.
1,can't use,waiting over a month for a kindle to use this with. If I ever get the kindle I might be able to tell you if the memory card has any use. Right now it is still sitting in the un-opened box.
2,Terrible Customer Service,"The product was satisfactory.The customer service provided by TigerDirect AND by Amazon.com was terrible!!!!!As a result of the customer service failure you are losing a long time Amazon customer.I have just purchased a set of speakers from Buy.com, I would normally have gone to Amazon for such a product. I did not even look for them at your website.If you are at all interested in my problem please review the entirely unresponsive response I received from your customer service group.John M. Cronin"
1,Not a wise purchase,"After searching for answers on how to get this card working, I found numerous complaints from other frustrated customers. It seems apparent that PNY sells defective cards. As a consumer, I don't need to spend my day searching for answers or reconfiguring systems to get something to work.I'm always amazed at how companies expect the consumer to spend a ton of time jumping through hoops in order to resolve an issue. Just buy from another company, as I did, and you'll be fine. My camera worked the minute I used a different card."
1,34 days before it stopped working,"When I first received this, as a Christmas gift, it would not be read by any computer. It worked for 34 days, being read only by my Nikon S3300. It suddenly stopped recording new photos. Inserted another SD card, and determined it certainly wasn't my Nikon that was screwing up. THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP. Will not be buying this brand EVER again."
1,Do not buy any PNY sd cards,"Ive had this SD card for about 3 days. Me and my friends were making a video. I tired to upload the videos YESTERDAY. and they didnt go on my computer which is weird cause it supports Apple MacBook. So i tried uploading them on my PS3 and that didnt work at all either. Then i put it back in the camera and it said. ""CARD DOES NOT READ"" Do not buy this kind of memory chip. better off with another brand."
3,used?,I bought Tiffen Filter from Adorama. No scratch on surface but looks like somebody touched and wiped looking. It was sealed. So I don't know it is an used filter or NEW but I wasn't expected like that as new product.
4,better black and white,"This filter is primarily for b/w photography, although you could use it for color with a rather obvious and unusual effect.The lens works by filtering some of the blue from your photo. This means that for cloudy sky, and some vegetation and architecture shots you will see greater contrast. There are more or less intense red filters available depending on the degree of effect you want."
1,Defective Upon Arrival,"Although I've long used Tiffen filters, I had to return this one I bought from Amazon as it was delivered to me in a defective condition; the lens was discolored all around the mounting ring, possibly even separated."
4,Pretty good renditions,"Some of us have heard of the ""unknowns"" on this tribute album. Perhaps you've heard of a little band named Frente, who became popular from their cover of New Order's ""Bizarre Love Triangle""?! I also enjoy The Earthmen and Ashtray Boy. As with any tribute album, usually the originals are better, so don't go looking to this or any tribute to be the answer to the Go-Betweens. Listen to the originals and the covers and judge for yourself. Or just take both as separate entities, which they are and can be. These versions of Go-Betweens hits are good on their own and can be good introductions to the originals."
3,Order this to receive tons of junk mail!,"This is a cute item and you can't find this sort of thing in stores anymore--they're all cloth now which I guess is safer if eaten. The point of this review is to say that I purchased this item to use for a photo shoot of my toddler as a baby zookeeper feeding meat to her toy lions. Random, sure, but it wasn't ordered for a pet and I certainly didn't order it to be placed on a bajillion mailing lists without my consent. I can't believe these people sold my address to PetCareRX and the like. I also receive phone calls and emails and have spent too much time removing myself from these lists and getting puzzled responses from the call centers like it's crazy that I don't want to be bothered with this nonsense. Ordering this product will give you a huge headache and not just from the annoying squeaker."
1,Beware,I can't prove it but I think this is fake product. I use the real product from the salon and it's great. This stuff was like putting water on my hair. There is no way this is the same product.
4,Good product but not extraordinary,"It is a good product. However, not as good as Matrix sleek look the bottle with the Orange which makes hair look much smoother."
4,Great AGP card,"Pros: EXCELLENT LINUX SUPPORT, Silent, 256mb, DDR2, Dual monitor out, optional low profile bracket.Cons: AGP, not the fastest card around.I bought this card to bring my aging AGP based P4 system back from the dead. This card works flawlessly in Linux, using NVidia's proprietary drivers. It runs Compiz and all of Fusion's plugins, and it can handle the basic compositing add-ons like kiba-dock and avant-window-navigator. It is, however, a little slow to run all these things at full speed.If you need a capable, silent, affordable, AGP video card for linux, this is it.If you want a video card capable of running all of the Compiz eyecandy and the fanciest addons at full speed, you'll need a faster card (and I'd need a faster machine).9/10 overall. Highly recommended."
4,Great graphics,"Great graphics, easy to install, outstanding pics. Once I got it, opened the box, 15 mins later, I have it installed and running and I was very pleased. My games, pics, websites, and programs are sharper and like I said the graphics are great. HIGHLY reccomend this product to anyone looking to upgrade their graphics card."
3,No GPU fan - be careful of heat problems,"Until this card failed on me due to heat issues, it was a good price for performance.My interal case temperature (Not CPU temp.) reached 80 - 82 degrees Farenheit over several hours; I left the PC on, went to work and air conditioner was off. Upon returning home, I noticed some glitches I assumed to be WinXP related and rebooted. The reboot never initialized graphics to the screen. Swapping out this card with my old 5700LE resolved this issue.In summary, this card is good but without a GPU fan, will fail sooner than cards with a GPU fan."
4,Good card for the money.,For the money this is a great card. Installed easily and with all that memory it runs intense games very nicely.
3,This graphics card with 256 MB needs a cooling fan,This card does a nice job displaying the graphics but does have a tendency to overheat
1,Burned out,"The card burned out in less than two months in a large, well ventilated, aluminum case. I don't do gaming so it was hardly stressed."
3,Returned,Product was not in a sealed box and appeared to be used. Seller was very concerned and immediately arranged for a return for me.
2,HELP! Does this works with Vista?,I bought this video card from Amazon 4 months ago. I have 1 Dell machine running XP and 1 HP machine running Vista.I wanted to install this on the Vista machine- but it won't fit in the slot!!! Does this work on Vista? is it compatible only with certain mother boards?
2,NOTHING SPECIAL,I was excited to get this card mainly for use with 2 monitors and flight simulator 2004 since all the graphics had sqaury edges etc. I originally used the graaphics built in to the mtherboard 128 mb gforce something. This new card did nothing new. i cant tell the difference between what i had and what i have now. the graphics are still the same as before even though i adjusted everything. DVDs look the same also. only difference is that you can adjust the colors on the monitur and plug in two monitors at the same time but to do this you need a dvi adapter that costs $4 on ebay. By the way this card was made in 2004 and i bought my computer in late 2005. if you want quality just pay for a real card. im gonna return this.
3,just for graphics,"Use DVI on Dell 2707WPF monitor for Photoshop. Works well enough,I probably could have used more memory."
5,Great card for dual head monitors,"I purchased this card for an Acer T135 AMD Semp 3100+ 512 DDR with 275 watt PS, AGP 4X, XP home, stock unit. I was unsure of the power requirements as I had seen it stated as 350 Watts on another site. The box states ""Pentium 4/III/II/Celeron, AMD K6/Athlon. APG 8X or AGP 4X, 256 Meg, Windows 2000/XP. A minimum 250W power supply is recommended in systems where a number of other internal devices are installed"".I have it driving two CRTs, an IBM 21"" and a 19"" dell p991 both at 1200*1600. It was easy to install with no issues. The default monitor is associated with the VGA connection but it was no problem to switch it around to the DVI-I connection. I have found no issues and am very pleased with it's performance."
5,XFX GeForce 6200 256 MB DDR2 AGP,"Very nice card for the money.I'm not a gamer, so this does everything I need very well.Installed without a problem.VGA and DVI displays both look great.Should meet the needs of anyone not a diehard gamer.No tuner if someone wants that."
5,The digital output is great!,"I have a Dell 4600 with the built in video on the motherboard. Use it to build websites for businesses and municipals so high resolution is very necessary. Bought the XFX GeForce 6200 and as recommended, increased the power supply on the computer to 450w. Hooked the 6200 up with the digital cable provided and WOW! Never saw a display look so good. Fast, crystal clear graphics and text..Whats up with that? Very impressive.If you don't have a digital hookup for your monitor, the newer flatsceens have the digital plug in capability where the older LCD's don't. A very nice addition."
4,"Good, but...",I needed a better card for a game I was playing. I assumed this would be better than my old card simply because I was going from 128 to 256. I was wrong. There's nothing wrong with the card; it works perfectly. I just still need something better.
3,XFX GeForce 6200 256MB DDR2 SGP Video Card.,"Works OK, was looking for more as it is linked to my Panasonic Plasma and the automated sync kept falling over, but if you don't spend the wasted hours trying to sync automatically and do it yourself then a good card at a reasonable price. Conversion to low profile was my main reason for purchase and if you buy the kit it's easy. BUT YOU MUST BUY THE KIT, because while it says it's low profile on the box it's not without the kit.Low Profile Bracket Kit"
3,"Not bad, but not great","This does offer a great option to custom mold to your foot. It takes a few trials until you get your proper arch shape. These are a decent Over The Counter orthotic, but there are better ones out there (Sole Custom Footbeds, Superfeet, Powerstep, etc)."
2,well made but not enough arch support,"this is probably 5th pair i got rom spenco rx products for my parents as both have issues with their feet.. This orthotic version was the first of its kind purchase. It has the characteristics of well made insert from Spenco, this pair meet expectations. It offers a strong heel build, it is not just rubber / foam mix,this has a molded glued plastic portion, gives strenght to heel. But it does not offer much arch support as i am used to seeing in Spenco products. I didnt return it, using it as fresh insert for a pair sneaker."
2,Very Disappointed,For me the distance between the heel and the arch is too long and you cannot trim the heel like you can the toe section. Also the arch support is very hard. I would not purchase again.
5,great remedy for flat feet,"I rely on these because I have flat feet. Without them, I was getting stress fractures (I walk several miles daily). Now I wear the best available shoes with arch support and add the spenco orthotics to each pair. No more stress fractures."
2,Squeaky,"Pros:These orthotics fit perfectly inside my size 15D shoes.Cons:Since the ball and toe section of the item are made of a flexible rubber foam, when sliding my feet into my shoes the insoles would slide towards the end and curl up.The most annoying part of these orthotics is that they squeak loudly when I take a step due to the orthotic rubbing against the shoe. It was terribly annoying for everyone around.Don't get them."
1,too wide to fit any shoes,"These inserts are very wide. None of my shoes fit, even the wide tennis shoes. Since there are a hard plastic in arch to have a better support, they are not be able to trim. I emailed the seller to ask is it the right size (women 6). The answer was ""Yes"" it is the correct size. It labeled size ""1"" for women size 6 and Men size 7. It is not practical to have one size for both Women and Men. Have the factory tested to see whether it can be fitted into Women's shoes. I had paid shipping and not willing to pay more for shipping to send back for refund. Thought may be one of friends or families can use, but so far, no luck."
3,Spenco Rx Orthotic full length,"it is OK, too flimsy does not stay intact as insole come with the sneaker. may be the designer should look at the sample from good sneaker insole."
3,adequate,"The purchased product was the correct size for my shoe/feet and required no trimming to fit.The item is a thin sheet of foam rubber with a hard plastic heel/arch support about 2/3-3/4 overall length underneath.The placement of the arch support does not conform to my foot structure. The arch support is situated more to the middle of my sole and back towards the heel. It misses my arch by about 1/2"" in and 1/2"" back.According to the instructions, it is necessary to place the inserts in boiling water for two minutes and then mold the softened plastic to custom shape.I have not yet done so but will update on the results of the customization."
5,Much Cheaper Than Orthopedic Shoes,I love these inserts for the comfort they have provided my heel pain They are much cheaper than having orthopedic shoes made to specifications. My doctor recommended Spenco brand to me. It was a good recommendation.
5,Great!,"These came with the perfect amount of arch support I have been looking for!! So I didnt have the need to heat and mold the arch. They felt so good, I immediately ordered a second pair."
5,Super Buy!,"I have been wearing these for years, and could not believe the price when I saw it. You will not find a better deal on these full size orthotics anywhere. FYI - these cured my plantar fasciaitis, er whatever!"
4,Spenco Rx,"Great insoles. They are Soft, but they give great arch support. I have two pairs of these in some of my casual work shoes. I'm on my feet walking around a classroom much of the day. At the end of the day my feet are relaxed and comfortable"
2,Keep sliding forward,"These inserts feel great until they begin sliding forward in my shoe as I walk and bunching up underneath my toes. Tried them in 2 separate shoes and they keep sliding forward. Box says ""unconditional guarantee"", but can't get a hold of anyone at Customer Service to complain. Sticking with my Dr. Scholl's Extra Support."
2,Good but not great,"I've been using another brand of insoles for several years but tried Spenco mainly because they are about half the price of the insoles I've been using. The Spenco insoles worked okay but do not help my feet, legs and back nearly as much as my tried-and-true brand. So, needless to say, I've changed back to my old brand."
1,Spenco arch supports,"Although it was the item I ordered, these had a 3/4 hard orthotic under the insert, so I had to reorder the soft spenco arch supports. It took a long time both times to receive my order. But they were a lot cheaper on line."
2,not what I expected,"I have bought spenco insoles for years, and these were very different. They were very wide, and not well suited for a woman's shoe. Quality wise I guess they are ok, but the only time I think I'll be able to use them is in my snow boots, and that's not why I bought them."
4,These Work Very Well,"I have just completed 400 running miles on these orthotics, and they have been excellent. I switched to them from an old pair of prescription orthotics after my podiatrist retired and I didn't care to get involved with a new one, especially since I was having no problems. The gamble has paid off: The Spenco OTC orthotics have worked just fine for the past six months, and I've saved hundreds of dollars. They also are lighter and take up less space inside my running shoes. Only one minor drawback is that the material in the toe area tended to fold up and bunch during a run. This was easily solved with a small dab of adhesive under the Spenco at the front end."
4,keeps me warm!,"I love these pants. They do fit about one size too large, but on a windy cold day, they feel great. Soft inside like sweatpants."
2,Handicapped on Mac's,"This works great on an IBM PC. It is a disaster on a Mac. This software caused constant freezes on the Mac Intosh computer. This application was used in a classroom setting for handicapped children. Most of the children liked it, however the bonus CD(a Bug's Life) which was included free of charge is more popular and offers more content."

Most of the children liked it, however the bonus CD(a Bug's Life) which was included free of charge is more popular and offers more content. Both of these application's worked very well on IBM PC's with an INTEL Pentium."
1,Sound problems,"Start up music was cute, 3 yr. old very excited. As soon as she began to play I realized the game did not operate as specified. Sound cuts off at the end of each phrase and boredom set in quickly. She is much happier with Jump Start.Not even worth the sale price."
1,Not compatatable with my computer system.,"I purchased this for my two year old daughter but she has yet to use it. After seven calls to Disney Interactive customer support I have reconfigured my computer so that my speakers don't work for anything else, all my scanned photos are terribly grainy and I still crash windows every time I try to run this. I have an e-machine which meets or exceeds the listed requirements. Customer support was very nice and tried to help, but I'm sorry I wasted my money on this product."
1,not for mac,"This said it worked on both pc and mac platform. However, it does not work on macs, only on PC computers"
2,Caused PC problems,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 2; she did enjoy playing it for the first few sessions. She became bored with it rather quickly after that. While it does look very cute, quite bright and colorful, it's very simplistic - even for a 2yr old. It definitely wasn't worth the retail price I paid for it.It was installed on a PC with Windows 95, and it ran ok. We later upgraded to a Windows 98 OS and it never would work after that. The PC locked up every time you tried to run the game. I was so disappointed in it that I wouldn't buy ANY Disney software for over a year afterwards. (Disney greatly improved their software creation process after this one, I'm happy to say.)Speaking as a PC professional, I'd caution anyone purchasing it for a computer with ANYTHING higher than Win95, this product won't work correctly."
3,An Okay product from Disney,"It is a standard software for preschool to learn their alphabet, shapes, colors ....The characters are cute and the background is colorful. But I don't find it has anything different from other software to draw the attention of the preschoolers!"
5,Sacred Fire by Nancy Wood,"My husband and I love this woman's poetry. We discovered Frank Howell the artst through her books since he did her illustrations. We bought one of his works from his studio in Santa Fe, NM which is now run by his son Daniel."
3,Big book with too little detail,"I was disappointed that a book this size had such limited descriptions of the animals. Nearly half of each page was devoted to a map which showed the areas where the animal might be found. The pictures of the animals are black and white sketchs with no color descriptions in the text. Can you imagine trying to identify birds without knowing what color they are? If the map had been scaled down there would be plenty of room to give more detailed descriptions of the creatures. The idea is very good, but the book is a disappointment."
3,Average,"The score for Dante's Peak is an agverage score for a disaster movie. There is good music in the cd. Such as the love theme in track 4 and the rescue scene in the last track. But, the cd is missing some of the more enjoyable cues from the movie. And why are almost every Varese Sarabande release is so SHORT? All in out, an ejoyable cd."
2,Not too great,"I'm sorry to have to be the first to throw a damper on this soundtrack, but of all the ones own, this is one of my least favorite. Aside from the fact it's ridiculously short, the vast majority of music is just relentless action music. Now, don't get me wrong. A little of that is fine, or even a balanced mixture. But when it's pretty much all that way, I think it just gets annoying, and heavy-handed. The redeeming factors about this CD though, that keep it from a one star, are the love theme (Track #4), and the very majestic triumph theme in the final track. It's really pretty! Plus, if you are one who likes relentless, driving, action cues, than you may very well like this. It just wasn't one I cared much for."
2,Did not do it.,I did not care for this book. It was poorly written and there were many spelling and gramar mistakes that took away from the story. The editor was not doing their job.
3,not as good as it used to be,"I agree with the 2009 reviewer in reqard to the content. It's a great magazine to read and view and dream about having the money to own such boats. I had the subscription for 5 years. I must say that in the last year, the magazine has gotten about 20% thinner. Such is the way of print. Like my subject line said, it used to be better (more stuff). Hence, I didn't renew my subscription. Just don't have the time to read it and with the reduction in the quantity, figured not renewing was the thing to do.Still a great buy at less than $1.50 per issue when you get to see parts of the world and a lifestyle that most of us will never see. Sometimes it's good to dream a little dream."
1,So very Bad... Its good!,"Parts of this film rate up there with ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".Plan 9 from Outer SpaceThe special effects are especially laughable.There is a scene where the heroes are being chased by the tornado; When the heroes turn and drive down a side street, so does the tornado!"
3,"""Night of the Twisters""","The movie was pretty good. It did cover most of what happend that night in Grand Island, but they should of kept the name of the town. I don't believe that the movie followed the book so much. I mean Dans mom did not go to work that night she went to check up on her neighbor. Dans dad went to there grandparents house to fix a car not to check up on them. And they did not live out of town. they lived in town. I gave this movie a 3 because it was ok but i did not follow most of what the book said."
4,Excellent entertainment,"Teenager Dan Hatch and his friend Amos are babysitting Dan's baby brother, watching TV and fooling around. But a major tornado is coming their way, unbeknownst to them but knownst to us, and we just want to scream, ""Get the baby and get out of there NOW!"". I just love the scene where the ping pong table swirls around for a few seconds, then flies away! In fact, unlike Twister which mostly showed us the damage from the outside, Night of the Twisters makes us feel much more ""inside"" the tornado. And it's fun! The scenario is very well done, carefully building up to the climax: the tornado chasing car scene. And the special effects are surprisingly good, right up there with Twister! Wholly recommended to any disaster movie buff."
2,cheesy,this movie is cheesy and lame.....but great if you are married to a teacher and her class is reading the book ;) Making you the super husband for a day or so.(Also great if you are looking for a funny and cheesy movie. I would just rent it)
1,Worse movie I think I've ever seen,"I have no idea what the people who wrote all these other previews were watching but this is the worse movie I have ever seen . . . well almost. Napoleoan Dynamite was bad, but at least it had funny moments.This is bad effects, horrible acting and very unrealistic scenes. Complete tornado devestation while not a drop of rain or moisture on the ruins, police cars or even the ground!!. Four tornado's his a town and not a single drop of rain! lol. We didn't even finish the movie, but left the room."
5,book puppy primer,excellent basic book for the new puppy owner. should be on every dog owner's shelf.
2,Falls Short,"I am not a dog trainer but have purchased several books recently to help with the ""housebreaking"" and some basic behavioral concerns I have been having with my 15 week golden-doodle (who in general is a very good boy). This was not the book for that kind of help. It does have some interesting concepts but there are a number of better books out there that cover alot more situations for about the same cost."
2,warp speed- beam it back/ Scotty,"Xmas 2003, used 5 times, warped, legs do not touch evenly,grease does not drain into channel,buyer beware, going to swap out one at Target, as to not pay shipping back to WestBend, You get what you pay for, thank you China!"
4,Great griddle,"We have owned this griddle for about 2 years now, and it still works great. Cooking is even, food doesn't stick, and food heats up quickly. It's not the easiest to clean with the grease channels, and the knob finally broke a little, but it's still usable and has been consistent."
4,West Bend Good for the Money,"Overall it is a simply designed and effective product. I am happy with it and would make the purchase again if doing it over. The only issue I have is that it doesn't heat perfectly even, but this is more of a food aesthetic issue than a food quality issue. It's wonderful to make more than one pancake or french toast at a time, and great for Okonomi-Yaki."
5,Griddle lovers celebrate....,"Hi Everyone,I love my new griddle. Tho not the one I originally wanted I must say I am VERY pleased with this one from West Bend. It has plenty of cooking room for a variety of items to cook at once. The heat seems to be very evenly distributed, and cleanup is a breeze. Great for seasoned cooks as well as new cooks. I would recommend this as a great gift for yourself, or for a bride to be starting out.Peace to all, Mary"
4,West Bend 76220 20-1/2-by-10-1/2-Inch Griddle,"The griddle is very spacious. Eight pancakes easily fit on the surface at one time. I haven't tried to fit an entire pound of bacon on it at once, but it looks like it is big enough for the job. The heating element gets up to temperature fairly quickly and maintains its temperature consistantly. The only problem that I have found is that the the surface temp. is not distributed as evenly as I would have liked. Pancakes may come out two toned, golden brown where they were directly over the element and paler toward the edge."
1,Hooray! Now we can delude our kids too!!,"This book presents information on psychics, dowsing and the paranormal that simply are not factually true.There's even a part that says to go with your gut feeling when taking a test in school because that's the psychic ability talking. Man, if that actually worked then I'd have gotten straight A's.Chapter two seems to be about frauds and phonies. Unless this is a list of every person who has ever claimed to have psychic powers then I would say that it's dangerously incomplete.Please, don't delude your kid with this nonsense. If you're going to get them a fictional book then I would suggest at least getting one that represents itself as such."
2,Sorry to say.....,"This was just an O.K. book. I love decorating books, this is my least favorite. Usually decorating books inspire me and I can't put them down or at least have to fill the book with post-it notes to mark great ideas. This book I looked at,once maybe twice... it didn't give me the inspiration to do anything. Pictuers are nice... but the context,the way its split up ,then and now is just boring . There are much better books on cottage decor out there. just have to say sorry but not my fav."
3,"Great Design, No Help","I truely enjoy this book. The photography and ideas are very current and create a mix of style, comfort & ideas I personally delight in. However, I was so disappointed there was no resource guide...at all. :(I have spent days trying resource the botanical prints and have come up empty.oh, well."
3,Just ok,"Not my favorite cottage book, and I own many. There was just nothing special about it. It didn't inspire me as I had expected. I didn't enjoy the reading - didn't hold my interest. It does have some nice pictures."
4,Good Comp For Beginner,"Minus about 6 tracks, most of these versions of these songs appear on the Never No Lament: The Blanton-Webster Band [BOX SET] which is sounds just as good as the mastering does on this compilation. If you are curious about Ellingtons Sound then this is a good way to go for a decent sampling of his early work. However, it would be worth the few extra dollars to buy the box set and get a more comprehensive selction of Duke Ellingtons music of this period. The box contains 3 discs containing an average of 25 tracks each - more than triple the amount on this compilation. In addition, the box set comes highly recommended (by Jazz writer Tom Piazza-from his book: The Guide To Recorded Jazz) as an essential document of Duke Ellingtons contributions to early jazz. Altogether though, all of this music is pure joy to listen to, if you are at all inclined to listening to early jazz and big band music then you can't go wrong with this compilation or even better the box set."
4,Eminence ASD 1001 HF Driver 8 ohm 50 watts,Great product changed my drivers for my self powered speakers and was amazed by the power and clarity of the soun will surely buy again....
4,great music,Makes you feel like you're attending the concert in Carnegie Hall; great music -- lots of favorites.
3,are those pirates?,"I played this CD for my son, aged three, and and he asked me ""are those pirates?"" I responded that the Clancy Brothers were not pirates, but he persisted. ""Are they SAILORS?""I figure the songs are pretty entertaining, but if a 3-year old can't tell Irish folk singers from sailors or pirates, it can't be all that good.zoreb"
3,Sound volume out of synch,"Concert is enjoyable, but audience volume is way too loud and any speaking sections between songs way too low. Having to adjust the volume up and down throughout the whole performance gets old really quick."
5,The Whole Concert at last! (and a little more),"The Clancy Brothers and Tommy MakemIn Person At Carnegie Hall(2 CD Legacy Edition - The complete 1963 Concert +)This is THE live ""Irish Music"" concert. Both an excellent concert and an important document of the Folk movement of the early 1960's, this is a beautifully expanded and completed re-release of the concert. This is joyful experience.Five Stars!"
4,Wonderful rendition,"I can hardly tell the difference between this and the actual score as played in the movie, which is more than can be said for the re-recording of the North by Northwest score. Just from listening to the sound clips here on... I can tell that THAT one is all weirdness. This Psycho one, however, is not. I love listening to it.I had it playing on my birthday. Just as I was attacking the cake with a large kitchen knife, Mother's shrieking violins began to sound. That was the strangest coincidence I have encountered in a long time. On a side note of possibly lesser interest, the cake I was cutting was a swampy one, with a car sinking into the slime, and a dude standing there watching as it disappeared.But that has nothing to do with this CD, really. Buy this CD and listen to it often."
2,Mediocre version of an excellent score,"The score for Hitchcock's Psycho is in my opinion on of the best ever written. Unfortunately, this performance is not at all close to the high standards of the original soundtrack recording of 1960 with Herrmann himself conducting. The conducting on this cd is insecure, and the sound is very muffled, though Mcneely picks tempi that correspond fairly well to the original ones. The original tracks aren't available commercially but I would also put Herrmann's own rerecording on the Unicorn label above this one. The Unicorn cd is slower throughout than both this cd and the OST, but the conducting is of much higher quality."
5,A Musical Nightmare of Fear and Depression,"Hermann fans could argue for years over which work from this incredible composer's canon is his best , but I think all of us would place PSYCHO somewhere near the top. This ""strings alone"" journey into despair must rank as the most depressing album in history. Listen to it from beginning to end and you'll need therapy. Hermann jerks you around relentless with his ""Prologue"" music, then lays on a sort of existential despair, and then segues into edgy, nuerotic tones that indicate a fractured mind splitting apart even further. This new recording captures this horrific music with crystal clear tones and perfect performances. You don't need the film -- you only need the score. OH MOTHER, BLOOD!"
4,"Great rendition of this classic score, but not the only one","A previous customer reviewer (staysun@hotmail.com) mentioned that up until the McNeely recording, the original score for Herrmann's ""Psycho"" had not seen a commercial release. Actually, Unicorn- Kanchana's Souvenir Series released the ""Complete Music for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho"" conducted by Bernard Herrmann and performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra in 1989. The only variation in this newer release is the addition of track #23 (Cleanup) and a second version/take for track #31 (""The Search B"", instead of ""The Search A"").The Uni/Varese rendition of the complete score to Psycho is wonderful and quite faithful to Herrmann's own rendition of his classic score. If you can't locate the Unicorn-Kanchana 1989 CD recording, the Uni/Varese is a fine substitute."
2,Unfortunately not very good,"I had high hopes for this re-recording. Everything is sort of OK but it misses aggressiveness. And it supposed to be 'nervous'. This re-recording doesn't make me nervous whatsoever. And it sounds like you are sitting in the back of an empty church while the orchestra is playing in front of the altar, like one big reverb-pit. That's allright for boys choirs if you're into that but Psycho (I think) supposed to sound almost like you're in a dead room. And that's where Danny Elfman comes in. He did an excellent job on that lame Gus van Sant re-make so there's at least one thing that came out right from that movie. The problem with that one is that it's incomplete but it's way, way better then McNeely's version. Go for Elfman's version. Money well spend (and better art-work)."
5,There Will Never Be A Better Release,"Okay, I've read some belly-aching reviews about this not being the exact ORIGINAL score. Look the condition of the exact ORIGINAL score is either very poor or out of print. Joel and his Orchestra did a marvelous job with this. It is extremely faithful and does an excellent job of capturing the true spirit of the ORIGINAL recording. This is as good a release as we are ever going to get. There are other releases of the score true, but woefully incomplete with sound quality that should never have been considered for release, except by greedy moneygrubbers. Get this and enjoy."
2,Pestle broken when received,"The product itself is nice, but it wasn't so nice that it was broken when I received it. It's too much hassle to return it because it would cost more than it's worth. Sincerely, S. Lusk"
2,Ummmm,This must be for medicine cause it ain't for cooking I splatters all over the place just not what I was looking for now I'm using it for decoration thanks for the decoration.....I guess
1,Very bad packaging. Broken item on arrival,"I had purchased two mortar and pestles.On receiving the items,the pestles were broken.I had to glue them and a "" scar is showing on the pretty pestles."
2,Not polished,"This mortar and pestle looks nice, but that's the only reason you should buy it. The inside is not polished like the outside. If you grind the pestle into the mortar it creates a lot of chalky marble dust. So unless you need extra mineral in your diet, go with porcelain or glass."
2,Too smooth,"This is a very pretty mortar and pestle, but it's too smooth to get any real work done. I went with a ceramic version instead and sent this one back. Very happy with the ceramic. It has just enough roughness to work the item you're pulverising without the problem of difficult cleanup."
1,Disappointed,"The mortar and pestle looked great online but when I received it, the interior marble finish was scratched up and the felt liner was coming off the bottom. It was a gift for Christmas and I was embarrased to give it but I didn't have time to return for another. I think it may have said only 1 left at the time of ordering, so perhaps I got someone else's return. Disappointed."
3,nice but...,it is nice but very fragile. pestle broke 2 months after first use. excellent for garlic and herbs. it would be nice if the manufacturarer would sell the replacement pestle
2,Not really impressed.,"I grow my own herbs, and wanted to use this to ground them up. It does not do a very good job. I tend to just use my food chopper instead, because it works better."
5,My Personal Choice,"This book was suggested reading by a drug and alcohol counselor, who seems to have an utmost curiosity in all things sober. I can't thank him enough. I knew there was something more needed in my life than the 12 step approach, and here it is. From page 24, Vincent A., ""What helped me stop was the mutual support and practical advice rather than the 12 steps."" This book is giving me added hope, greater awareness, and helpful, positive reading to the women I sponsor, (mentor). Thank you, Anne and I hope you continue to write. Brooke"
5,"Informative, insightful and inspirational!","This book has helped me deal with a life long(since high school) battle with a ""functional"" alcohol addiction. It has presented me with all sorts of options, ideas, information and testimonials of people who have been through it all! I read a least a chapter or two a night and it kept me going in my quest to moderate and even cut out my alcohol consumption. I feel prepared to tackle this issue for the first time in my life!"
1,Dangerous Propaganda,"Rediculous book that does more harm than good for people who are struggling with the disease of alchoholism. It can convince people that they have a ""manageable"" problem which can lead to disaster."
1,"If it works, don't fix it","This is a book for people who want to get sober without doing any real spiritual work. In other words, a book for drunks who want to have an excuse to relapse. If you want to get sober and stay sober, try reading ""Alcoholics Anonymous"" and going to some meetings. At least that approach has a track record. If it works, why fix it?"
4,Sober for Good,I really don't knoe myself. I bought it for someone else. She says it's good and is applying some items found in it.
1,Disapointed,"I should have listened to the other negative feedbacke about this product. Of course you get what you pay for...I'm a pretty ""heathly"" gal and this bracelet was waaay to big! I purchased it to cover a small tattoo I have on my wrist and it was so loose, it fit halfway up my arm! So much for a ""bracelet""!"
1,copper temptation not tempting....,This bracelet should never have been packaged and shipped...it was stretched too far out of shape for wear and simply slid off my wrist over my hand to the floor. I was very disappointed since I ordered it with other products in which I am pleased from this seller...I threw it in the garbage!It doesn't rate any star at all...but I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Biggest ripoff in the industry!,When I unsuspectingly bought this ripoff some years ago I was outraged to discover that there is only 23.5 minutes total time on this CD. Don't waste your money!
3,Its great...but,"Well, It is so cool how you can punch out hundreds of pieces and they are reversible clothes too! (very handy) the only thing is that they are easy to get lost after you have punched them all out! There are do many pieces and the storage thing isn't that helpful. It is still very cool and I'm sure younger kids (I'm 12) would enjoy it moer becuase they don't worry about those things!"
5,Fun with granddaughter,"This has been my 3 year old granddaughter's favorite thing to do with Grammie. At first she picked out the doll and clothes to use, as I peeled the sticky shapes for her and punched out the clothes. Now that she is almost four, she has mastered peeling the paper off of the sheet to get the sticky shapes of her choice and we now take turns picking out a doll to dress and selecting an outfit, but we always work together. It is so very relaxing getting involved in this activity with her. We love sorting through the many pages of options that this wonderful book has to offer."
1,Bad purchase,"No matter how careful you were taking the dolls out from the perforations, it ripped! Everything ripped!! The purchase was aRIP-OFF!!!"
1,5 year old grand girl doesn't like it,"As a Christmas present to my grand girl, it has yet to be played with. The pieces are so small. I think it may be overwhelming. I would NOT recommend it."
2,Not a relaxing project!!,"As a teacher of young children, I find this book to be extremely labor intensive. There are many, many pieces and you must use sticky tape to apply the clothing. I even had trouble getting the backing off of the tape. I can't imagine doing this for every change of clothing I wanted. By the time you find all the pieces and put all the sticky tabs on, it takes about 10 minutes just to put on one outfit. There are too many choices in this book. Children benefit from simplicity and this book does not offer that."
1,paper dolls,The dolls were most unattractive. Not at all like the pretty paper dolls I played with when I was a little girl. Not well done.
5,Awsome book that draws you in,"I had the sample to this book sitting on my Kindle for several weeks while I decide I was more in the mood for reading Paranormal Romance at the time because I was having a bad run with Harlequin romance. I have to say, if I had any idea of how good this book was going to be I would never have waited.I loved the fact that this book wasn't just filled with relationship problems but also suspense and mystery. The writing flowed perfectly in this book with everything coming to a satisfying close. I have to say that Lucky did get on my nerves a little sometimes when it seemed she only wanted Jack to make all the sacrifices but she always ended up redeeming herself and in the end it made everything seem more real. I will defiantly read this book again and pass it along to family and friends."
5,Great Tool!,"I was looking at several serpentine belt tools before purchasing the Gear Wrench ratcheting tool, the ratcheting feature is nice and the tool is well made; it also comes in a molded plastic case keeping the set together.I would recommend the Gear Wrench serpentine belt tool, it's worth the extra money.PS.Corpus Christi, TX"
2,save yourself 50 bucks with this little trick.,"This tool works great. But it is overpriced just to do one task.But if your car has a 15mm tension bolt as most do, there is a really cheap workaround, using two simple tools that almost every garage mechanic has.You need a common 15mm combo open claw / 12 pt box wrench, and a 1/2"" drive ratchet or breaker bar. Put the open end of a combo wrench on the tensioner bolt. now insert the 1/2 inch drive on the breaker bar into the box end of the wrench. By serendipity, It will fit snugly! Presto, you have a nice long serpentine belt wrench, and you just saved yourself 50 bucks!If you need a different size or work on lots of cars, I would buy the Lisle unit. They have great quality, and half the price. Kinda wish I had bought the Lisle to begin with."
4,Great tool but...,"I ordered and received this tool from Amazon and was very pleased with the quality and design of the tool. However, it was just a bit too bulky to work on my 2003 Honda Element (the power steering pipe/clamp on the adjacent wheel well wall is just too close). So impressed was I with the fit/finish/design of this kit that I considered keeping it anyway for other cars. But since I am not a professional mechanic and don't change a lot of serpentine belts, and because I am not wealthy, I am reluctantly returning it. The only other potential complaint I could see about this tool is that the handle is a bit shorter than some I've seen and therefore might require a bit more muscle (but this is just speculation since I couldn't get it on the pulley at all)."
4,Good but not great,This is a good complete set that has all the sizes you could need. The only complaint that I have is that the sockets seem a bit thin thus maybe weak. Only time will tell how well they hold up however since I purchased it as a kit for home car repair the kit should be robust enough to last years to come. I would worry if I were to be purchasing the kit for professional auto repair use as the sockets being thin might show premature failure in that setting.Overall I got it for a good prize and fast free shipping from Amazon so I'd purchase again because anything more heavy duty would be easily twice as much money.
4,Good way to learn Access 97,"I'm usually able to learn every other program on my own, but I struggled to figure out Access 97 without help. This book came to my rescue. The tutorials are well done and cover almost every aspect of the program. Great beginner book."
2,I could pull a better DVD out of my...,"I didn't get it. I want to learn but this only teaches the preliminary basics that I've read in books. I wanted a DVD so I could see ""in action"" how to sail. The dock portion (beginning) is ok. When they set sail, it's filmed from a powerboat that keeps a distance so that you can't see the details of what they're doing. The sound is terrible. The soundtrack is painful. I have seen better production from first year high schools. I could go on but I am trying to find a professional ""How to Sail"" DVD right now."
5,Relaxing,This Cd is very well put together and has a nice beat. It's nice for doing your homewok or Driving a car. It will keep you very relaxed. END
4,Great graphics,"This one won't create an Einstien in your family but it is fun to play-if you can get it to work! It would only load on my 5 year old (and painfully slow) computer. Apparently it is only compatible with the old DirectX version that Disney uses. Some of the games have plain old silly fun like designing and painting a car in Goofy's garage and playing with the controls up front like the wipers, etc. There is a matching/squirt gun game with Huey, Dewey and Louie. Daisy's Diner offers some nice games with pattern recognition. There's another game for listening skills and numbers. If your kids are big Minnie or Mickey fans, they may be a little disappointed because you don't see much of them. Overall, the game has nice variety and great graphics. I suspect Jaclynn will bore with this one fairly early on, though because there are no levels of play to adjust and it is not very challenging."
1,PC Users Beware,Causes Windows to crash repeatedly on both my Win98 and Win2000 machines (no problem with Reader Rabbit on both). Mac-centric development evident. Disney offer 90 Day Money Back Guarantee but offers no information whatsoever on how to carry it out.
1,WHY so much money?,"WHY would anyone pay close to 300 dollars for this?? You can buy each season brand new for 45.99 each...There's only four seasons, so why would you pay an extra 100+ dollars to have them all wrapped up together?Nice work Amazon, brilliant."
2,Very disappointing.,"The theme you carry away from this series is ""everybody cheats."" I'm not kidding. Every single relationship in this movie falls apart in various places because they cheat on each other. The first season was the best. At least the music was good, and the acting was decent. After the first season, they started making a soundtrack that was all pop music that the men are listening to in their apartments and it is really bad cheesy. In the fourth season, they play this melancholy piano melody in EVERY episode. It got to where I was fast forwarding through the sections with the piano melody in it. All in all, the entire show was just a massive let down. The first season was enjoyable, and I will probably watch it again. After that, it's all depression and heartbreak and cheating and misery. Continually. Not my cup of tea."
4,Excellent Overview!,An excellent overview on the 'what' and 'how' of performing Unix system administration in the real world.
2,It doesn't deserve good marks,I wouldn't give good marks on the report card for this author. There were not enough information about internal operation of Unix operating system. I was expecting more. Many good reviews. I don't know why.
2,Not what I expected,"I did not expect the cactus men to be cut off. They are about 2-3 inches shorter than others I purchased. I'm not even sure they'll stay on the antenna. My fault I guess, should pay attention to details."
4,cute antenna topper,"was a cute idea for your antenna,i have had a cactus for my vehicles for a long time ,after visiting arizona (and bought my first one) thanks"
3,"Fine review, but bias is very evident","Mr. Ellingworth definitely knows his Greek. My desire, however, was to find a commentary of the Greek that was more objective, providing the possible translations and the contextual supports/detractions for each. Mr. Ellingworth's bias towards a dispensation theology is extremely evident and is the premise of his work rather than a supported conclusion. Perhaps this is necessary, but this bias does not just bleed into his commentary, it pours all over it. Ultimately and understandably, the author's bias influences the weight he gives other possible translations and I could not be sure how much of this bias produced an anachronistic interpretation. Overall it is a well-presented exegesis, yet could have been better if Mr. Ellingworth had softened his predilection towards his adopted theological schema."
4,Great goof around for scales practice...,"If you are tired of practicing scales and modes with no idea for how they are useful, pick up this CD and try out your improv skills over some really nice sounding backups. All the components of a band are there (rhythm, bass and drums) except for lead guitar and vocals.The wide variety of keys and tempos is really great, but I do have to say that a lot of the tracks on the disc aren't as bluesy as I would have liked, and some are very close to being classic rock in sound. That is great, but I had really hoped to have some nice 12 bar to play in front of (there are enough of those to keep me happy).At the price, this should keep you entertained with a fun way to practice your scales in a non-linear fashion. I had a guitar teacher that used to do this same thing and we would play for 10 minutes a lesson, I think it really helped me to visualize the scales on the fretboard, which made my playing much more fluid."
4,Good For Beginner & Intermediate,"This book will give you the basic facts and insight required to build a solid groove. It provides some technical stuff, that's for sure. But the main thing is, you can develop a feeling of the groove in yourself (not your guitar only) and start to understand what it really means ""to groove"".However, advanced / pro players trusting their groove may consider alternative books."
5,My Favorite Shampoo and Conditioner,This is by far my favorite shampoo. I've used multiple products over the years - everything from VO5 on sale for .79 to Profound from my salon at $125/bottle. None of them have worked as well for me and for as long as Biolage Color Care. The conditioner is equally as good. The two together are perfect. I love ordering these from Amazon as they are delivered right to my door within a day or two and are priced LESS than they are at my local CVS.
1,Bad batch?,"I have used this product for years with no complaint. This recent bottle that I bought was horrendous - my hair doesn't feel clean and the fragrance of the product is not what it normally is. Caution when using this specific vendor through Amazon I guess. I have sent an email to Matrix, but haven't heard back from them as of yet."
5,Jenny,"This shampoo keeps my hair color from fading, leaves my hair clean and soft, and it smells wonderful. This is my color care shampoo of choice!"
5,The Most Important Issue in America Today,"This book contains vital information for all Americans who care about our civil rights. Exposes the U.N. for the threat it poses to democracy. Very well written and very well researched, this one's a real eye opener! MUST READ!!!"
1,he really believes that his country can survive isolated,The origins of this book can be found in the fear. The author really believes that his country is the only one that really matters in the world... it's exactly what we could wait from a blind conservative like this. The only problem is that history continues...
1,"Fine Musicians, dull music.","Despite the fine musicianship and truly superb acoustic characteristics, this album is inexcusable dull. I know teenage amateurs who compose music that is more sophisticated and engaging in every way... musically, emotionally, intellectually, you name it."
2,Mary O'Leary,"Those expecting the haunting ambiance of Howard's film scores will be greatly disappointed in this pseudo-jazz endeavor. Though not worth the price tag, the cd's fidelity is noteworthy, however, and perhaps useful for checking one's stereo settings."
5,The wait is over,"Possessing the original vinyl in 1984, the wait for the CD release was heaven. This is the best James Newton Howard has produced. The synthesis of rhythm with Toto is beyond words. A must in any collection of classics!"
5,Excellent heater for worksites,"I have used this heater in the past two winter seasons. Rented both times and I now will be buying two of them. The thermostat allows you to use the propane gas wisely by lowering the temp if so desired. I ran these indoors at night only in a finished two story 1466 sq ft place at 45-50 degrees off a 40 pound tank. The tank lasted me almost a week. I did pay attention to close doors though. Last year in a much colder time and place I ran them for four days off a set of 100 pound tanks and kept the temp up around 60-65.I like these much better than my Reddy 30.000, which is fine but you can't leave it overnight without draining the tank. No thermostat..."
2,Hawkwind - 'Space Bandits' (Roadrunner) - 2 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1990,this being the sole studio effort that Hawkwind pulls in a female vocalist,Bridgette Wishart as a full time member.There's a home video/DVD where you can see Wishart front the band yourself.'Space Bandits' is one out of three lp's of the long-running space rock ensemble that I really don't care for all that much.One upside to this CD is that violinist Simon House returns.The only tracks here that I sort of like are the rocking ""Images""(decent guitar work),""Black Elk Speaks"" and ""Ship Of Dreams"".I liked the band's live release 'Live At Glastonbury 1990'(see my review)MUCH better."
5,Brought tears to my eyes...,The first time I listened to this piece tears were flowing from my eyes. It is a beautiful collection of music.
4,Works great! but...,Need a helper with this. There is a sharp part on the base and my helper cut themselves on it while cranking. Need to file this part and make smooth. otherwise great.
3,"Solid, effective rerecording of these scores","I was first introduced to Joel McNeely through his scoring of the soundtrack for Star Wars:Shadows of the Empire, which made me less wary about buying this new recording of the Batman movie themes than I ordinarily would be. Elfman's work still shines through, though having tracks from all three movies really illustrates how the Goldenthal music from the third film doesn't connect as well to the first two. Themes, notably the Penguins in ""Batman Returns: Birth Of A Penguin"" (track 10, as mentioned in another review) are accentuated a touch differently by McNeely in comparison to the Elfman originals, but it's a solid recording. This compilation is a straightforward way to obtain a 'best of' the soundtracks from these movies without buying all three scores, if you don't mind a distinct lack of liner notes."
3,Not as good as the originals,"Although it was nice to see a slightly different listening experience. The new tracks composed by Joel McNeely are a slower pace to both that of the Original soundtracks (Danny Elfman & Elliot Goldenthal) and the actual film result. When it came to the vocals in Batman Returns, I felt that the Royal National Orchestra just couldn't hit those high notes, which made them sound out of key.Overall, if you just like the actual tunes of the Batman themes - and don't worry too much about hearing the actual music from the films, this would be a good album for you. This album gives you alternate instruments in some areas, and acts as a new way of listening to the scores."
3,Cool McCool makes me drool,"My memory certainly was more kind to this series than it deserves. The graphics are terrible, the sound production is bad, the writing and voice characterizations are poor, so I may be unable to force myself to watch all of the episodes. I think the bonus materials glorifying Chuck McCann are sappy and excessive. I think the other reviews that convinced me to purchase this series were overly generous in praise. Thank God I only spent $10."
5,C-o-o-l-l-l-l !!!,Classic cartoon series from the 70's era...for those 35yrs and over it's a great trip back to childhood very well priced.
1,What's in it?,"If I knew what was in this giftset, perhaps I'd buy it. Meg Ryan has made a lot of movies. Is this a biography? Is this snippets of her more successful movies? Is this one or two movies packaged together? Can't tell from the info you've provided, Amazon."
1,Only read this book if you want to lose all of your free will!!,"HiOnly read this book if you want to lose all of your free will.It basically tells you that you are not a person and under no circumstance should you trust your own mind or your thoughts, everything is ego.This review is written by an ego as well and after you read this book everything you ever think will be ego and therefore evil.Only Andrew Cohen can tell you what to do because his drive is passion not ego.Anything that you think of yourself is ego, you just aren't good enough as you have not had a spiritual experience.Andrew is special you are not.There is no God just what Andrew Cohen is.Happy reading."
2,Just a Bunch of Advaita Rhetoric,"The only thing I get is this guy can spoon out the rhetoric. Accept what is, blah, blah, blah. There is absolutely nothing here but talk. What is it about this guy? He's a rookie with a long way to go. he should be a Sales Manager. he set up camp way before he should have. He's arrogant. what can I say, he wants to be in charge. Poonjaji convinced alot of people that they are enlightened, he's cheapened it. He's the K-mart of Enlightenment."
1,You guys just don't get it,You're not allowing the intersubjective friction of consciousness to create the ecstatic compulsion necessary to create the future in a way that allows a greater uber reality to emerge in you. You are denying your rapturous inner god and need simply to feel you own blissful interconnection with the ultimate core of the orgiastic universe that will liberate you and your species for all time.Hilarious...how often can people be fooled in the same way?da free John rides again.
4,Book that pleases,"I bought this for someone to give as a gift for another person, and the recipient was thrilled. The book is very knowledgeable and insightful about the book of Isaiah. Arrived in a timely manner as well."
2,Isaiah 1 - 39,"This commentary is very difficult to use, I don't recommend it for the typical lay person. It was expensive and I'm disappointed!"
5,"Very well written, informative.","Mr. Oswalt has provided a scholarly treatment of the first part of Isaiah, well documented, very thoughtful and challenging.Fair treatment of opposing views as well as justification for his own.Good investment."
3,Sheds,"It has a sturdy handle, but it loses hairs by the dozen every time you use it. For work where that's a problem, like picture framing, you'd be better off with something else. I'd love a brush that doesn't shed."
5,Harper Horse Hair Brush,This brush is just like the ones we got years ago. It is the right length & the bristles are soft enough to brush up the fine dust on bench or floor. Would recommend this brush.
2,Was fun for about 30 days...,"This toy was fun for about 30 days then it began to malfunction. At first it began to bounce only sporadically then it stopped bouncing all together. Fisher-Price (Mattel) customer service told me to replace the batteries and if that didn't work, return it to the store. After a month the receipt was long gone and changing the batteries did not help. The toy still says it's phrases and plays music but without the bouncing it isn't very much fun. It's too bad because my daughter loved it while it lasted. For 19.99, I think it should last longer than a month. This isn't the first Fisher-Price toy I've had trouble with lately. I think their quality is going downhill."
3,Misleading but still a good product.,"The brush is very soft and versatile which is good to get dust particle off the screen. Only fall back was the solution left streaks on glossy LCD surfaces, on regular MATTE surface it works great. It came with shamy cloth, which is nice but a micro fiber would of been a better choice."
1,Excellent/Terrible,"The location was beautiful but the only part of this movie worth watching was the star caliber performances of the extras, particularily ""Island Moron #13 (Man with Shades)."
3,"Cheesy, but fun","The audio quality is substandard and I think I may have seen better acting at a grade 1 concert. However, the story is very cute and romantic...in a cheesy way. It was entertaining and made me laugh. I'd definitely watch it again, despite the bad acting and terrible audio."
1,It won't even turn on,I purchased one of these 2 months ago and I have already sent back 2 of them because the led light will come on in the front of the screen but the screen will not power on. You also can not make the LED light go back off this product is not worth the trouble.
5,Good biography of Elizabeth I,"This was the book I was looking for. Very readable, and goes into Elizabeth I's personality and thought process more than other biographies about her I have read."
2,Interesting,"Rynn Berry's ""Famous Vegetarians and their favorite recipes"" presents an overview of famous vegetarians in history. Each biography of the 30 famous vegetarians is about 3-6 pages long. It is by no means a comprehensive nor referenced work (not that I'm questioning his sources, but that being that this book features short pieces of fascinating individuals, it only makes sense to provide a ""works cited"" list or a reference list for those who are interested to pursue their research). If you are looking for great vegan/vegetarian recipes, you are at the wrong place. Most of the recipes are not too appetizing."
5,Solid Horn Replacement,"I can't comment on durability, since I just installed these two days ago, but the difference as compared to my Subaru's factory horns is very noticeable. They aren't quite as loud as I had hoped, but without spending more money and getting into air compressors and whatnot, these are certainly good enough for me. No more will I have an anemic subaru horn trying to grab attention - they'll hear me coming from now on."
3,Decent replacement horn,"As other reviews have stated, for the money not quite as loud as I had hoped. But definitely louder than the extremely dangerous stock Miata horn and less hassle than an air horn - no delay or blown fuses... Also, connectors and short ground jumpers were included, but no other wire. Had to go out and get some wire. For the price a couple of feet of wire should be included."
5,"Had to get creative w/ the wiring, no slicing & dicing just used the jumpers","Had to get creative w/ the wiring, no slicing & dicing just used the jumpers. The 2 diagrams provided for the wiring did match my configuration but I just used the provided jumpers to complete the circuit w/o having to cut my OEM wires this is good to do in case you ever have electrical issues you can return it to stock before bringing it in for warranty work. This is installed on a nissan juke so if u need assistance (w/ juke install) comment on this w/ your email and I will send the new schematic I made, it's really simple."
4,these horns blow,"They are nothing special, but seam to do the job ok. I wish they were louder. but sound the same as the originals for a 2001 ford f150.Update: 6/18/12 Adding 1 star, because they are louder than I thought. So good as a matter of fact I am buying another set to replace my new 2012 accent meep meep horns."
1,"Disappointing, at best","Purchased this horn for my 2010 Toyota Highlander. The horn got me away from the ""beep beep"" sound that came with the vehicle and gave me the ""honk honk"" sound I was looking for. HOWEVER, I was hoping for a lot more volume. These are no louder than the horn on my minivan. I would have been better off purchasing cheaper horns."
