1,More fun than a brain tumor,"This is one of the most boring and annoying books to have ever come off of a printing press, going all the way back to the time Guttenburg printed his first Bible. It wanders from here to there, completely off topic, then seemingly forgets where it should even go back to. I couldn't make it to even page 100, and I was angry that I had wasted so much money. I threw it away."
1,It's incredible to me,"the amount of hype given this book. It's a clip job, boring and not that accurately reported."
2,I Just Couldn't Make It Through,I suppose I was expecting something differant...more of a focus on the apartments. It just dragged on and on. I really was not interested in the individual investments of people (no matter how famous). Photos would have been nice. I was expecting a history not an book on economics and investments.
3,"Kindle Edition- Great recipes, bad format","The recipes look great with fresh, healthy ingredients. I purchased the book today and made one of the recipes tonight (Mulligatawny Stew). It was an instant hit with my family. I have a couple of complaints about the Kindle edition, however. The table of contents does not include each recipe (as some other cookbooks do), so there is no way to simply touch the recipe and go directly to it. With so many recipes, it could take a while to find the one I'm looking for. My biggest complaint is that the ingredients list is in a light grey color and very hard to read. I am considering returning the book for these reasons, which is a shame because the recipes look great."
4,Nice Cookbook For Soup and Stews,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend, but liked it so much I ordered another copy for myself. The recipes aren't the same as what you find in every soup and stew cookbook, but they're simple and good - perfect cold weather comfort food."
5,great cookbook!,This is a great cookbook for the soup and stew lover in your life. I purchased this cookbook for myself and have really enjoyed all the soups I've made. They are not overly complicated and yield a very enjoyable meal.Friends have enjoyed the cookbook enought that they have put it on their Christmas wishlist- so I am purchasing additional books as Christmas presents!
4,More pictures,"The different soups is pretty good, but there is no simple stew - it's all snazzy stuff. Also, food is about how it looks too so it would be nice for there to be some pictures in it."
1,Soups n Stews,"I couldn't view it on my kindle... the recipes greyed out. Don't get it, it's not worth it at all."
2,"Faded, barely visible font","I don't have a color kindle and perhaps that's the problem, but I bought this book and the font is so light that it is barely legible. If anyone knows a way to change the font color, let me know. Other than that, the recipes seem okay, but are a headache to read. It is clear that the publishing company didn't test the kindle font out beforehand. Perhaps I can read it from my android tablet instead."
2,Not a good buy for the kindle,Do not waste you money and buy a cookbook on the kindle. It's not easy to use and there are no pictures. Cookbooks should be bought in hard copies only.
2,Sad Indeed,"When a company releases a ""Greatest Hits,"" ""Best of.."" and ""Complete.."" you can bet they cleaverly withhold at least one great song or use a remake. In this case, ""If You Don't Want My Love"" (1968) is omitted. It was maybe not everyones favorite, it was mine, but it deserved to considered among his top charting hits of all time. And, it seems, there is but one cd out there with this gem..Why it was omitted may be personal, but I sure won't buy something that is not what it says it is.The cuts at least seem to be original."
5,great cd!!,i'm always looking for the original songs and i'm glad this cd is here. i remember when the songs came out and you have kept them the same as i heard them on the radio. thanks terry
4,"NO, HE'S NOT SHANIA'S HUSBAND...","... fellow reviewer Rick Wingender is misinformed - Robert John the singer and prolific super-producer Robert John ""Mutt"" Lange are not one and the same - they are two totally different people.""Mutt"" Lange, Shania's husband, is much younger, slimmer, kinda femme-looking and possesses a headful of curly blond hair. Robert John the singer has been around quite some time, and although his weight has apparently yo-yo'd over the years, is usually rather heavyset and balding."
5,F-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c,"Fab music - the best of all worlds. Songs with a sence of tongue in cheek so rarerely found west of the UK, and a dircet approac so rarely found north of elsewhere."
2,Not worth the money,"The toy has a flea market quality. I have already written 2 reviews that have not been posted. I guess they haven't been posted because I have written where they can be found a whole lot cheaper. The original price is nowhere near the price at other stores. This is the same identical item, but just rigged up at a hirer price. Cheap toy."
2,Big time disappointment,"I had high expectations for the Coolpix 8700 being a Nikon product. I have been very disappointed with this camera for thefollowing reasons:the owners manual is almost impossible tounderstand unless you are a rocket scientist.The viewfinder is very poor quality and most of the time i cannotsee clearly the subject i am trying to photograph.The time it takes to take a photograph is very slow and by the time the lens has opened and shut, the picture has changed.I took some side by side comparison photos with my little Kodak 3.1 mp Easyshare DX 4330 which is several years old and was much much less expensive than the Nikon Coolpix 8700, there was no discernable difference in the quality of the pictures!I find all the buttons on the Nikon confusing, and like another reviewer said, by the time you remember which one to use it is too late.This is my first Nikon camera, but i plan on selling it and buying another camera from the Kodak Easyshare line."
2,Focusing system,One major problem with this camera is its focusing system. Autofocus is not reliable in a low light (what camera thinks to be a low light -- and this is not what you expect). On the other hand manual focus is comletely inefficient.
4,Take great pictures,"Positive features:-Take great picutres-Auto focus work very well-Got a lot of features to offerNegative features:-Using 1G fast 80x recording speed compactflash still it pauses about 4 seconds to record the pic. when taking 8M pixels pic. Taking pic. less than 8M don't have this problem.-Flash is not powerful enough to take pic at night, need to get an external flash.Overall:Having this camera since 2003 and still taking great pictures. Note the bigger the len is, it allows more light into the camera, the better the pic. resolution."
3,great camera - lousy company,"I bought an 8700 from a local dealer. It works. It takes great pictures. That's the good news.The bad news is that when trying to order accessories, one hits a giant wall of whipped cream -- you push on it and your arms get real sticky, but the wall is still there. Calls to Melville get you to tech support, who deny everything. Their reputation on the net is ""customer support is terrible."" The company just doesn't give a poop. Lord help me if anything breaks.So, the rate is 3 stars. Great camera, but the company doesn't care after the sale."
2,Poky,"Good quality photos in outdoor lighting. Inside in low-light conditions I found them quite grainy unless I was standing very close to the suject. The worst problem was the shutter. It was WAY too slow! By the time the camera took the picture, what I was hoping to capture was gone. I got rid of the camera. It wasn't worth the hassle. I would have given this a 3 star rating, but this is a Nikon. Up until purchasing this camera I was a big fan of their cameras. What a disappointment!"
4,Nikon Coolpix 8700 8MP Digital Camera with 8x Optical Zoom,"Bought this camera in Dec 1996. Found it to be a very complicated camera to use unless you shoot in Auto mode. In Auto it produces excellent Quality photos. Don't Recommend for Actions shots. Stills are excellent. Too many buttons to manurover around if you want to shoot other than Auto.I paid $999.00 plus Tax at Comp USA. A bit pricy,At this price you can buy a nice DSLR.Good luck in Figuring out how to use Filters. especially the ones that you like."
2,Messing with greatness,Hackett takes great music and then for some reason only he can explain goes off on irritating tangents that ruin the majesty of some of these tracks. It drives me crazy to the point that I find myself skipping whole tracks when I listen to this CD.
2,Not the Typical Version of the Qur'an,The typical Sunni Muslim should not purchase this translation. This is a translation for a specific sect of Islam called Ahmadiyyah. There are large differences in the beliefs of both sects.For the past two years I've been reading this book for knowledge but I have only recently realized my mistake. There were actually a few times that i would be reading the commentary offered in the book and would question myself because the thoughts offered in this text contradict typical Sunni beliefs. I'm a convert to Islam and luckily I've realized my mistake. I been recommended Muhammad Asad's translation by some friends of mine and I will soon be purchasing that translation.
3,pay attention,I had no idea these things came in different sizes. Make sure you check to ensure you are ordering the right ones for your charger.
4,"These work fine, but when did they get so expensive?","This brand of charger is what I've been ordering from Amazon... but it used to be eight dollars for a 10-pack, not fourteen.I'll look elsewhere.Update: And they are back to ten, plus 4-for-3.So this means I can get 40 of these cartridges for 30 dollars, or 75 cents/charger. Better than it was for a stretch there, but I'll stick with the Leland 100ct:100 ea Leland Soda Chargers Seltzer Chargers CO2"
3,image misleading,I have ordered two of those... and two boxes I received.Image is very misleading when it shows x36 boxes I expected 36 boxes in the order not one.
1,Buy this product locally,"I purchased these cartridges as part of a gift which was ultimately declined. Although Amazon will ship to you, they will not accept a return. This makes no sense to me."
4,"Still four stars, different reasons","I'm glad I picked up this game. It was worth the money I spent for it. The graphics are still pretty good for a game based on the Quake II engine (which I don't believe is used at all anymore). The sound, with the execption of the main character's hammy voice acting, is good. The level designs make sense. The buildings look and (I don't know how else to put this) FEEL like they should. In other words, the Iraq level buildings don't look just like the Kosovo buildings, only reworked.With the right difficulty setting, the enemies can be quite cunning. They will dodge your fire, duck, roll, and wait for you to have to reload.All in all, SoF is a fine, albeit VERY violent, first person shooter.The bonus footage of the upcoming SoF II: Double Helix is a nice bonus, too."
2,"Nothing more than violence and a bunch of guns, Save your $$",I bought this game because ...I had a gift certificate. The singleplayer is pretty lame and repetitive. After the 1st couple levels I was failed to be at all slightly impressed. The graphics are pretty good but I noticed a lot of graphic flaws. For example when people's limbs get blown off they are missing textures and if you load a map through the console you'll notice a lot of graphic glitches. In singleplayer you do nothing but kill people and press a bunch of buttons...THATS IT!!!I played the multiplayer but after a couple games I was bored and quit. Multiplayer games are nothing special and not at all exciting. I played this one CTF map online and the floor was missing. The weapons don't seem balanced. For example I unloaded a clip of a machine gun at someone in a online game and he didn't die and than he shoots me once with a shotgun and I die...THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!!<...
4,"Major goriness, but fun","As I was installing Soldier of Fortune Platinum, a prompt asked me if I wanted to put some limits on the level of blood and gore in the game.""Nah,"" I said. ""How bad could it be anyway?""Boy was I in for a surprise! I've been shooting things in games ever since I was 5, and I'd have to say that Soldier of Fortune would be #1 in blood and gore so far.Shoot any enemy in any place and they react in the proper way.A shot in the foot will result in bad guy grabbing his leg (or lack thereof). My favorite thing to do when I'm in an evil mood is to unload a whole clip of SMG bullets into a bad guy's chest and watch him do that crazy dance of his.The game does have limits, but only in story and level design. But when you're in the mood to just walk in and blast away a few hundred bad guys, simple story and linear levels can be a good thing. Just don't let little kids play SoF or even watch you play it without the parental controls on."
5,THE KING OF KINGS,"Well, all of us video game players wait for so long a game like this one now that it has more than a year of it's start in the market the only game that can win this one is the second part don't you think?hey this is the more brutal game ever.it isn't for you koids i'm serious...."
3,"This game could have been great, but......","I enjoyed this game very much, the plot and storyline were excellent, but the game was rendered on the outdated Quake II engine, so the graphics while better than Quake II itself, were mediocre at best. The game focused too much on blowing people apart and not on the quality of the graphics to enhance the storyline. Also the gunfire and resulting injuries or kills were very unrealistic as to what they would be in real life. I don't think there is anyway a pistol would blow someone's arm or leg completely off their body. While this is no high quality game by any means, it is a very fun one and has a very engrossing storyline and plot. Let's hope they use a much better engine in the upcoming sequel and that the storyline is as well developed in the second game as it was in this one."
2,Violence Has Evolved,"Soldier of Fortune is a breakthrough of violence in the gaming world! But that is all it is. The game uses a heavily modified version of the quake 2 engine. The characters look somewhat blocky. The worst part of the game is that it is extremely repetitive. You kill person after person after person, that's all you do. By the end of the game you'll have killed over 1000 people. The story wasn't worth telling, and the enemies never get exciting. The difficulty settings were badly designed, luckily you can create a custom difficulty setting, which I reccomend.If you enjoy computer game violence this is for you. You'll dissembody every conceiveable body part. You'll here men screaming as their skin burns. If you don't care what the violence in games looks like there are many other FPS's better than this."
3,"Good graphics, very very very VOILENT GAME!","This game is good because it's powered by the QUAKE3 ARENA ENGINE!!that's all that's good about it.It's so violent, theres the most mature rating content I've seen in a fps. it's so gorey, so bloody, so voilent, so much suggestive themes, I only played it for 10 minutes then uninstalled it off my computer, tried it 3 more times, felt the SAME WAY!This game is too voilent and should only be played by people 17 or older, HECK, I'm only 13 and I coudn't even stand it!Naughty I was to play it, eh?for all the 17 years olders and higher, buy this game if you are voilent and gory and want a voilent shooter, infact, then if you like this, YOU ARE VOILENT.!17 years old and up, buy this if you want.Any thing below, I don't reccomend it unless you have your parents permission..........."
2,Interesting,"This is not a book for the casual reader, but someone investigating the literary genre would find this helpful. It seems like a lay readers' version of someone's masters thesis."
2,Dreary and Depressing,"I am sorry to say that I liked neither of the selections on this CD. There are two of them; they are different; but they might as well be the same. Each is a long droning instrumental ""background"" with a very occasional voice to wake you up...maybe.These two compositions are not at all like some of Mike Oldfield's long works. There is very little to distinguish between the beginning, middle and end. It seems almost as if 15 or 20 seconds could have been recorded and set on repeat. The same is true to a lesser degree for the second piece.Some may like this for background or mood music. I'll pass."
3,beautiful friendship,"If strings added to the arrangement, sales of this albums would grow.""Let the heartaches begin""can't be missed.Vinton's voice is as good as ever in the '60s."
5,Short review,"This excellent book focus on explaining the flanker variants, particularly Su-30 and later ones. It's one of the most up-to-date books on Su-27, with many interesting pictures (such as Flanker's cockpit display when it dropped bombs, production line pictures, different variant prototypes in flight... etc). It's a must have for readers interested in Russian military aviation."
5,Underground and Kickin',This band has gone almost completely unnoticed. Sometimes that's the way I like it. Unfortunately I need other people to like this so Stroke will make more albums full of superb music like this one. Their songs run the gamut. Listen to the samples and then buy the album. Tell your friends and repeat.... PLEASE!!!
4,Very specific Guidelines!,"This book has very specific ideas and guidelines, so if you are a more free-flowing kind of person, it could be irritating. I liked the drawings and the general tone of the book. I'll try out the specifics this October when I go to the Mayan Ruins in the Yucatan."
2,Ouch.,This book was not what I expected and therefore the low rating.The introductory segment about an adventure in Ireland was excellent. I would have liked to have more illustrative segements such as that one.Some of the tips for organzing a travel journal were helpful. But that was it. I passed the book on to someone who may get more out of it. I don't want to get in touch my inner Budha. I do want to be more mindful of my travels. This book didn't do it for me.
5,The Realities of the War in Viet Nam Brought Vividly to Life,"I thought this memoir was excellent. I was in Da Nang, Viet Nam from ""69 to ""70. I saw and experienced what she did; today, I feel the same way that she does. This great country of ours and the people in it have let all of us ""Viet Nam Veterans"" down because, I believe, of the devisiness of the war. All that we ask is that we be treated with respect as other Vets are. A wonderful book of how she coped. This is real."
5,An honest story of the war and aftermath for one (and many) nurse in wartime,"very captivating, couldn't put it down. Tells how life was in vietnam and the aftermath of life with PTSD (before PTSD was known about). Very honest in the most detailed of emotions. Having read 'home before morning' many years ago, this is at least as good if not better. I highly recommend.Details of caring for the most critically wounded and working with not enough trained people to care for them, of having to let some die so that those with a better chance could be treated.Explains how the stupidity of the Vietnam war policies trickled into the health care of wounded and those who treated them."
5,This stuff restores dry rot tires,I used this stuff on 25 year old motorcycle tires and they look brand new. Its my new favorite shop liquid.
5,The Peanuts gang is funny again,"In You Have A Brother Named Spike?, Snoopy gets a visit from his brother, Spike, who lives with coyotes. The Peanuts gang is surprised that Snoopy even has an older brother. They take the news in their usual humorous stride.Snoopy shines especially with his imagined conversation to Lucy and Charlie Brown about Spike. When Spike arrives, everyone welcomes him. Charlie Brown bought him a special bowl. but Lucy, after seeing Spike, feels that she needs to nurse him back to health.This book is just plain fun. Lucy is a riot as she tries to help fatten Spike up in Linus' bedroom. I think the Peanuts have a great way of making anyone laugh and this book definitely proves that point. I'm glad that my nephew picked this book out at the library, while he was here on a visit. Brother Named Spike is another good way to introduce humor to kids."
4,Great coffeetable book,"This sequel to 101 Un-useless Inventions, has 3 or more pictures with each invention. Learn about Japanese norms indirectly through these over-the-top inventions. Guarantee you'll be laughing before halfway through this book. You'll also shake your head in amazement and wish some of these things really were on the market. Notable ones: Cigarettes that light without a match. A clipper to clip all your toes at once. And the ingenious solar-powered flashlight. I'd recommend it as a giftbook or to have around the house to entertain guests."
4,A great book,"This book is great. It shows many inventions that you might want. Some of the inventions I even have made my own of because I think it would be very useful. There is only one reason why I only rated this 4 stars, The book is not very long I finished reading it in 2 hours while even doing other things at the same time...."
4,Orbit 57008 review,Pro:Easy to install. Intuitive programming - important for later program changes. Three different zones.Con: Time interval only 2-5-10-15... minutes
4,good choice ...,"I recently installed this unit and would recommend it.1) It is easy to program with the slide switches setting the individual time and selecting the program for each valve. This important function is refreshingly simple and logical.2) It is very easy to run a specific sprinkler circuit when you want to make adjustments or check the sprinkler head operation.I would make the following improvements:- Add a ""manual"" cycle which will run the entire program on demand when you need some extra water. I have to push the slide switch for each circuit into the ""manual"" position and then set the kitchen timer to remind me to turn on the next circuit.- I would make the display showing the water days larger. The symbols are pretty tiny.- The logic is not as intuitive as it should be. I find I don't know whether to push ""next"" or ""+"" or ""-"" to move to the next step or escape the function.I think it's probably the best controller for consumers. It could still have some minor improvements."
4,Deep house and a bit of progressive,Very nice album for Satoshi Tomiie.He has selected very particular tracks and there are all deep house with a bit of elettro-progressive.I reccomend you the buy.Victor.
5,This Album is AWESOME,"Some techno geek at Virgin Megastore on Sunset said I should buy this album. I'm usually pretty skeptical, but this is one excellent remix - very underrated. I have sunce purchased all of ST's previous works and am equally impressed. Move over Paul Oakenfold! Great for turning up LOUDLY in your car (especially here in L.A. where the traffic is brutal). This one gets me going better than a cup of coffee!"
3,Not as good as I was hoping.,"I am very much a Satoshi Tomiie fan, and bought this CD with high expectations. It had some good tracks,but ONE THIRD of the CD is comprised of tweaked versions of ""Why R U Here"" by Lexicon Avenue. Now it was kind of interesting and creative and all how it was mixed with ""Numb"" by Stephane K in the middle, but the song is well over a year old now...why take up so much of the CD with it?The Blue Haze/Bipath mix of ""Rumble Funk"" and ""Paranoize"" was a standout track, as was ""Subway Baby"" by Tribes of Khan Gala.""Cure"" by Echomen and ""Scandal in New York"" by S.T. with Ice are killer tracks also, but they both were getting played since the summer.When I by a mixed DJ CD, I am looking to be introduced to new and interesting tracks, and in this case I just didn't get what I was looking for."
1,"Nice look, cooks great, but does not last longer than a year","I bought my first grill and it only lasted 9 months before the entire inside of the grill was corroded (I thought it was Stianless). It was not safe to operate. After several months of painful conversations with Frigidaire Customer service, a replacement grill (the same one) was given to me. This grill lasted 12 months before I had the same issues. Outer shell of grill lasts but the inner shell of the grill corroded out.This grill looks great. It cooks great when it was new. But it sucks when it comes to long term dependability."
5,Nice Set,"We haven't used this set yet because our baby is due in June, but have set it up in our crib. The fabrics are very nice and contemporary looking. The bumper fits well in our crib, and the tags say all the fabrics are 100% cotton except the back side of the comforter which is a fleece type material and that is 100% polyester. We are very happy with this set for our future little girl!"
1,"Rather boring, actually....","Gaskell's work is rather boring and dreary. Riffing on earlier precedents (most notably Sherman, even if this is not ""self portraiture"" per se) Gaskell's tableaux reek of a rather vapid revisitation of staged scenario a la her Yale professor and one time boyfriend Gregory Crewdson (check out his book on amazon.com ""Twilight,"" and you'll see exactly what I mean) combined with a weak attempt at some kind of feminized fairy tale world gone wrong. Technically, the work is adequate, but c&#65533;mon&#65533;. is this the best that art world photographers in their 30&#65533;s have to offer? If so, it&#65533;s going to be a long, dry spell, indeed."
4,An Intriguing Mix Of Sterling's Short Stories,"Admittedly this isn't Sterling's best short story collection, yet it does contain an intriguing set of 11 tales which run the gamut from slightly hard science fiction (""Storming The Cosmos"") to humor (""Hollywood Kremlin""). Sterling is at his finest writing lean, lyrical cyberpunk prose in the tales I mentioned. Yet anyone expecting a literary classic comparable in quality to William Gibson's ""Burning Chrome"" may be disappointed. Still, Sterling, as always, is intriguing to read for his ideas and his uncanny knack at conjuring plausible near future scenarios, as well as his fine writing."
4,"Nice, But Should've Been Great","The art would've been cooler if it'd matched the cover art, but that's pretty minor. The dialogue was nice, but didn't need all the Wolverine introductions. Each issue states his powers, but since these are addressed through the story's actions, repeatedly telling readers hinders getting sucked into the story. Some of the basic dialogue was redundant, but didn't cause the same effect.I liked how Wolverine didn't seem invincible as some of the other Wolverine comics I've read made him seem. The basic arc's story, theme, and execution were nice and felt self-contained. However, the additional X-men issues unraveled the ending, introduced unnesessary unaswered questions, and made that last 1/3 of the book feel like a long Uncanny X-men commercial. That really killed what should've been a great read. Maybe I'm wrong."
4,Awesome story of Wolverine's Samurai background,"I wanted to read this story because I had heard it dealt with Wolverine's background, involving his samurai training. Well, the story didn't disappoint, as it dealt with not only that aspect but the romantic side of the character as well. Before Claremont and Miller got their hands on the fan-favourite character, Wolverine used to be a one dimensional violent character. Through the talents of the two brilliant writers, Wolverine know has a more noble side to him, and it comes through in the story. For on of the better Wolverine books, pick this one up."
4,Best Wolverine story ever.,This conception of Wolverine as a fallen samurai humanizes what was once an one dimensional beserker character. Miller does some of his best art but Claremont is overly wordy at times in his scripting. This is still the best story about a generally uninteresting Marvel comics character.
4,A GOOD READ,The thing about this book is that you get a whole series in one book. A really good story to read with a unpredictable twist.
3,Where is the Humor?,Rage and Sadness... Where is the subtle humor that was used to make Wolverine so enjoyable? If you are looking for the grin that makes him look human... look for another story. Action packed without soul.
5,Marvelous!,"This book reprints the very first solo Wolverine story, from the 1982 four-issue Wolverine miniseries. A tale of love, duty, and honor. The Claremont/Miller team is superb. Highly recommended."
4,Classic,"For fans of the character I'd recommend giving this book a read. The art and style are older then most graphic novels today. But i grew up with comics like this and I like them. WOLVERINE has all the ingredients necessary for a good story. Love, betrayal and ninjas! This is classic. I'd also suggest reading ""Old Man Logan"" that's an awesome book and the art work is nothing short of amazing."
4,good read,this was a fun magazine to read. not the best frank miller but still a good one. graphic and intense the whole way through.
5,One of the best comic stories ever written...,"Combining the talents of two of comics' true superstars, Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, this 6-part story takes the character of Wolverine in a whole new direction and served as the start of his own long-running solo series.A must have for fans of the character, fans of the X-men, or just those who love a good story."
4,Where is the end?,"Thoroughly enjoy the portion that was here, but wish it had the whole story. The art was clean and very impressive."
4,Good story for my fave hero,"I enjoyed this story because of the great mix of action, romance, and suspense. With an amazing cliffhanger ending, this book is an enjoyable read from start to finish. This novel definitely worth the $6."
2,1 year of use.,I have owned this for 2 years. I've shredded credit cards and papers with staples on them. It shredded paper fine for a year but now the paper just seems to clog up between the shredder wheels. This happened to previous other shredders I have owned. The center wheels seem to always be the area that gets clogged. This shredder does have a reverse function to try and clear up paper jams. I guess I will have to spend more to get a shredder that will last longer than a year.
2,Worked until I shredded an envelope w/bank statement,Worked well for a while. Then I tried shredding a closed envelope with a bank statement inside (probably 3 sheets - folded). My bad. It was more than the device could bear. It is now broken and disassambly/cleaning could not fix it. Moral of the story; Push only the suggested quantity of paper through this shredder.
5,"Great size, 6 strong magnets, and good quality material","Great size, 6 strong magnets, and good quality material. It has a clear window for putting a map or maybe even an iPhone there for storage and navigation. I'm using it for a bit and see if I still need saddle bags, or if this will suffice. It is a nice size with plenty of room for gloves on hot days, etc."
5,Excellent,This tank bag is great. It's lasted me a long time and has great functionality for the money. I'll definitely buy another one if mine ever needed changing.
5,My 446th great Dowco product!,"Ok so maybe that's a stretch, but I own a few Dowco tank bags and a few bike covers. They are all great products. This one is no different."
1,Don't waste your money!,I have purchased other Dowco Iron Rider products before and have been very happy with them but this tank bag is garbage. I had it come off the tank while doing 80 down the interstate and it ended up in my lap. It spent the rest of the trip bungeed to my back seat. Don't waste your money on this as the magnets don't hold at highway speed. It looks nice but that doesn't offset the fact that it won't hold onto the tank properly.
5,"No Gimmicks, Just Good Information","Well, done. Recipes cover everything from General Tso's to Southern Cold Picnic Chicken and gravy. The best book I've found to correct the approach of northerners to crispy, fried chicken, WITHOUT THE CORNFLAKES! Lard is the secret and deep frying outdoors is the logical conclusion. Do it for the chicken. After all, how many people in your family are known for their deep-fried chicken? It could be you."
2,Some OK songs but not what you want to hear from Suicide Machines,"I have no idea what they were thinking when they wrote this. Maybe, ""Let's make a totally different band which is unrecognizable from the one we're in now but use the same name."" To be fair, there are a few good songs on here but you would never guess they were from this band if you didn't know.In reference to Destruction by Definition, they should have called this one Destruction of our Killer Hardcore Ska Sound. I rarely listen to this CD and if I do put it in, I take it out after under ten minutes."
1,Aaauugghh.,"THIS IS A WARNING to old school fans of The Suicide Machines who've never heard this album but would buy anything they do based on the strength of their earlier work: stay away from this bogus offering. This is not even the same band. If they call this thing punk, I suppose Phil Collins or The Proclaimers are punk as well. Avoid this disc at all costs.However, if you just looove all those middle-of-the-road alt-rock bands and have been waiting impatiently for the past 72 hours for the next one to spring into existence, then rejoice: The Suicide Machines are here, and they're Next Big Thing for Spring/Summer of the new millenium!"
2,One Word: Dissapointment,"I must say, the first time I heard the very first minute of a song off this self titled album, i was immediately bummed out. It's just not the high energy, hyped up Suicide Machines we've come to know and love. Though, because I'm such a SM fan, of course, I will always continue to back their music up. But, for all you music lovers new to the Machines, I would have to suggest you choose one of the their previous albums. Both VERY good :)"
3,good...but its no Destruction by Definition,"First of all, my favorite Suicide Machines CD is Destruction by Definition. This CD is good, but very different. Its very up-beat and ""happier"" than their other CDs. When I first listened to it, I wasn't sure if it was even the same band. The music is so mellow. I even heard some violins and cellos in the mix. If you love hard-core music, chances are, you might not like this CD. But its pretty good for having violins!"
4,Good CD,"This CD is not as good as Battle Hymns or Destruction By Definition. It is however a pretty good pop punk album. The best songs are ""sometimes I don't mind"",""i never promised you a rose garden"",""too many words"",""permanent holiday"" and ""I Hate Everything"". If you are looking for a Cd that sounds more like the old Suicide Machines check out Against All Authority's ""24 Hour Roadside Resistance"" but true fans will like this new Suicide Machines CD."
2,I just don't understand...,"Where have the Suicide Machines gone, and who are these guys who took their places? Sure, bands tinker with their sound all the time, but this is one of the more drastic changes I have ever seen. If you loved Destruction By Definition, you're probably gonna hate this one. Don't call them sellouts, but definitely call them misguided."
2,miss the real stuff,"I miss the fun stuff! where are these foo-foo songs coming from? I loved the realness of the earlier sounds of this band. they were great live when i saw them and i dont get this sound they need to stick with the unique sounds they started with go for the fun stuff not this teenbeat sound. loved their ska punk sound better.What""s up !"
1,"Wow, this is pretty awful.","Its annoying when people scream ""sellout"" at the drop of a hat, so I really wanted to give the Machines the benefit of the doubt here. In the best-case scenario, a band changes when they're honestly pushing themselves in new directions...then its only the narrow-minded fans who are left whining and complaining. Unfortunately, that's not the case here. This album is pretty awful. Gone are the bouncing rhythms, the manic time-changes, and basically all the energy this band once had. The new songs just feel hollow. Yeah, they're more melodic, but at the expense of everything else. The songs plod along in predictable alt-rock fashion and the lyrics really aren't THAT strong that they deserve to be the center of attention here. Really, the best thing this band ever had going for it was the ability to make people jump around like crazy and thats exactly what they don't do here."
4,"good,not great","The new cd is alright,its not as good as destruction by definition,but i still like the cd. At first i didn't like it much,but once i listened to it more it sort of grew on me, now i like it. My favorite tracks are numbers 2,14,6 and 8."
2,What happened?,"I have been along time fan of the Suicide Machines, going to thier shows as often as I can and buying their albums. But this album shocked the hell out of me. They've changed their sound alot. Not the usual punk/ska sound but like any other band that you here on the radio. But the album got its perks. I love the last song of a remake of ""I never promised you a Rose Garden""(I think that what it is called)It got everything that I liked about the Suicide Machines. Ska riffs turned into the punk side with an orcstrated background. I suggest that if your looking for the Suicide Machines, try looking for older albums like the Suicide Machines split with the Rudiments or ""Pave the World"" with the Blue Meanies and others.(Pave the World actually looks like an Blue Meanies album, but the Suicide Machines are on their but they are also know back then as Jack Kavorkian and the Suicide Machines.) If your a Suicide Machine fan, support them. I always have but sometimes these things happen."
3,leave the pop-punk to the Ataris and No Motiv,"I have loved the Suicide Machines since I saw them play with Guttermouth (who i went to the show to see), on the Destruction tour. Battle Hymns was even better. Now, this comes out! I mean, I love pop punk and this is a good pop punk album, but leave that to the bands like the Ataris, or do an album like this as a side project or something.The Suicide Machines used to be a band that was original. There are no bands that sound like their first two albums, mixing hardcore/skatepunk/ska like that. Now, they sound like a thousand college rock bands. I could accept it a little more easily if there was a transition period- but they went harder on their second album, and then suddenly drop this on us!i can just imagine their live show has lost the intensity too."
2,no good,"i really don't care for this cd at all. it infuriates me, because i've seen them live and they are so inredible, and have the potential to still be a great band. destruction by definition is a stellar album, and likely hard to match, but that doesn't mean one has to take the sell-out path. i'm only giving it 2 stars because of ""permanent holiday"". that's the albums saving grace."
1,What drove them to make an album like this?,"When this cd first came out i was really pumped. After thouroghly enjoying destruction by definition (one of the better cd's ive heard) and moderately enjoying battle hymns i was expecting them to put out a killer album. Wow, i was really really wrong. What i got was crap. Generic pop punk at best. They also have seemed to take up a new image. My thinking is they're doing the money/sellout thing, but who knows. All i know is that this cd was HUGE dissapointment. My advice is to skip this one and stick with DBD."
1,how could this happen,"The suicide machines first album was so good but this one absolutly sucked. what were they thinking. dont buy this cd if you liked there old stuff, because this is nothing like it. i hope they realize the error of there ways. they should go back to there roots."
2,Can you say pop not punk rock?,"What can I say, I saw this album on a shelf and thought that I should support the cause. Too bad it was the wrong cause. The first 3/4ths of the album is all pop. It's not bad, KROQ will love it. What throws me is the end of the album has a few (1 or 2) hardcore songs. It's as if the band was confused. Are we punk, pop, ska, or hardcore? I hate labels as much as the next person but I bought the album with basic expectations and they just weren't met. I'm sure it will be a great comercial sucess, but it's a musical failure. This album is an insult to all Destruction by Definition fans. Better luck next album. I doubt I'll pick that one up on name recognition alone."
2,*Sniff* The Suicide Machines sold out...,"This cd wouldn't be as bad if it were some other band. It has a lot of catchy tunes, but it's just not as good as the Suicide Machines once were. It's kind of depressing, actually. Well, the songs aren't, but the fact the Suicide Machines actually sold out is. ""Sometimes I don't Mind"" was played on the radio. And they were in Teen magazine. Now they sound kind of like a California surfer band, like Homegrown, who I like, but I'd rather just have the old Suicide Machines. Track #3 is pretty good, but still, it doesn't sound like them. Just stick to the old stuff."
2,I can't believe this band sold out,"Joining thr ranks of No Doubt and Smash Mouth, The Suicide Machines felt it would be better to alienate their fans and make money. This was the LAST band I thought that would do this. Ugh."
5,Totally rocks,"Though not as punk (and first CD is still their best) this one is better than battle hymns, and is definitely deserving of 5 stars. Upbeat and just plain rockin."
2,What happened?,where did this come from? I was anticipating hardcore!. If youre looking for a good ska/punk CD look elswhere. The band definatley sold out on this one but their first two rock.
1,If you like the Suicide Machines don't buy this cd,"I baught this cd thinking that it would be as good as Destruction by Definition and Battle Hymns. I was really wrong. When I got home, and put this cd in to listen to it I was shocked. I didnt know if there was another band called the Suicide Machines or what, but it scared me. I really dispise them for making this cd, because everytime I listen to some of their good music, I think of what a crappy job they did on this cd. So if you enjoy the Suicide Machines as much as I do than I recomend not buying this cd because its a waste of money and time. I still love them though, but this cd was just a mistake and all the copies should be collected and burned."
1,no respect for the machines now,"i used to love these guys. destruction by definition is a great cd, but this one just sucks. they have gone pop now. this is even worse than blink 182. you guys have just lost a true fan."
1,What happened to the Suicide Machines?,I still listen to the Suicide Machine's CD Destruction by Definition so I was excited to see this CD on the shelf at the music store. I put it in my CD player and searched for a good song. It didn't sound like them at all. I don't know why the Suicide Machines gave up their energetic skunk sound but I hope it was for a good reason because they had a lot of true fans. It's too bad because I didn't listen to my friend when he said this CD was all pop.
3,Good but disapointing,"This album really isn't that bad for a catchy pop album. The songs are good, but even when i'm enjoying them, I find myself wishing this was just a side project or a joke or something and the real album will come out in a few months and be all hardcore.I mean musically, the band we once new is gone. They changed so much in just one album, I can't believe it. People are comparing them to Greenday and Blink-182 now, but they've gone way past that. I love Greenday, but these guys are sounding more like the Beatles or something (They don't sound at all like the Beatles, I just couldn't think of anything better to compare them too). Then they go on tour with No Doubt just to rub it in. I love these guys so I really don't wanna yell sellout. Anyway my favorate thing about them was always what I got from the lyrics, and lyrically their spirit seems to remain the same."
2,"Fatal flaw in our copy, could be dangerous to a less competent driver...","...there is a major flaw in the copy of this video I checked out from my local library. During the virtual driving test, the car following the driver signals to turn left but when questioned on the test the correct answer is given as the driver was turning right. This confused me and I reviewed that part three times. I went to my own mirror and emulated the turn for myself and the video is in error.Think of it this way, the car trailing behind you is facing the same direction you are, not the opposite direction, ""wysiwyg-what you see is what you get"" in the rearview mirror."
1,Doesn't Relate To Teens,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this DVD does not relate to teens at all. My daughters 17 and 14 were laughing at it. The actors do not act well. It may work better for pre-teens perhaps.I was also expecting this DVD to provide more in depth information about emergency situations and defensive driving. Unfortunately, for my family it was a waste of money."
4,Rules of the Road,A fun dvd set starring teenagers and their parents --- as they point out parts of the car functions and how to start driving safely and affectively- you also get computer graphic roads to see demonstations
1,CRAP: Don't waste your money,"These disks are completely worthless because they won't play on any of my three computers or my DVD player. The computers complain the disks are protected by some sort of ""DRM"" and refuse to play, and my DVD player merely blinks and does nothing. Don't waste your money of these worthless disks. Next stop is to find out how to get a refund from Amazon for them."
2,This Video: Boring and Too Fast,"I tried to watch this video in the car on the tv/vcr during a trip. It was very boring even on a 3 hour drive home from Ohio.(I know you can't dance when your buckled against the seat of a car.)I had watched it before in my home and it was a little too fast for me (even though I take dance lessons). I found myself confused trying to do the oddly named dance moves that the girl on this video did. I know its confusing that I gave this video 2 stars after I've talked so badly about it. Well, I gave these 2 stars because the moves were very interesting and looked cool if you could manage to do them.If you decide to get this video, make sure the vcr isn't too far away so that you can rewind as many times as I did. If you want some laughs, just check out how boring and dazed the background dancers are. I had fun laughing at this video with my Mom."
4,Another good one from Toni Lynn,I first heard Toni Lynn Washington at a blues festival last summer and was blown away! I picked up her last two CD's and found the new one @ a used record store the day before it was scheduled for release (can't explain that one). I've listened to it quite a few times now & really like it. Blues and r&b fans will really appreciate this one!
4,I'm keeping my copy!,"Like many other reviews have already stated, this is NOT the only book you'll want handy while learning Japanese. I bought my copy after flipping through one in a bookstore so I knew what I was in for before I handed over my cash.Maybe it's because I come from a family of engineers, but I really like the way it's set up. I found that even after an hour or so of aimlessly flipping through and picking up bits of kanji, I understood more than I thought I would. Kanji appears at first to be so intimidating that I'd left it for last in my language studies, but now I'm digging in and enjoying it.Again, it's a worthy supplement, but do invest in other books to get you through your first year of study. I'll be keeping my copy handy for now, shelved next to Remembering the Kana and Japanese in Mangaland."
4,An excellent grammar with a good vocabulary mixed in,This book would benefit from from hiragana/katakana usage. It is almost more of a grammar for the language than a step by step learning guide. But it goes very in-depth on the possibilities of sentence structure.
1,Not that great.,I bought this book because I wanted something to prepare me for my Japanese classes.This book just sits on my bookshelf. It wasn't really helpfull by itself. I'd use this book as reference at the most.I recommend buying Genki: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese. It costs more but it is way better than this book.
5,buy this book-NOW,Very comprehensive and innovative book. Not only explains structure of nihon-go but also ellaborates on the reasons for why aspects of the structure are the way they are. The pitch accents on the romanji are extra-extremely useful. You won't be discontent with this purchase.-Making a copy of the table of contents will make this book more usable.
3,Excellent introduction to the Japanese Grammar,This book provides excellent background for the Japanese grammar but that is the extent of its value. Without any recording to help you pronounce correctly you do not learn how to speak Japanese. The book offers limited value in terms of reading Japanese. So buy it for the value it offers in learning the Japanese grammar. Otherwise you may be disappointed.
2,"Maybe I'm not smart, but I learned nothing from this book.","I read this book through from cover to cover once, skimmed it 2 or 3 times and then tried to take NOTES the last time as I started at page one again. I understood NOTHING in this book. The way it is layed out isn't fantastic and his use of symbols V1 and V2 etc. left me constantly going back to the beginning of the book to check what the symbols meant. And I agree with one other reviewer, his use of capitalization to help you pronounce words doesn't help much. All in all, I paid for this book and feel like I know LESS Japanese than when I started, simply because he succeeded in confusing me about the structure and pronunciation of words."
1,Amazingly useless,"When I first received this book, I thought I'd have a better understanding of the Japanese language. The verb chapter to me was a little confusing because he uses arrows instead of being straight to the point (ie like in Spanish verbs). Also, there aren't many Japanese characters throughtout the book. As I am learning a new word, I also like to know the Kanji or know if it's written soley in kana. This was a waste of my money, it's for people that don't know squat about Japanese."
4,Ware hooks it up,"This isn't my favorite David S Ware record by any stretch of the imagination. This record is a total departure from his previous quartet dates, but what it does is continues to outline David S Ware's superior harmonic sensibility. Many will be turned off because he doesn't play on every track. But when he does play, his overwhelming sense of melody and harmony is showcased. Don't expect the fire from his previous records. Instead you get a taste of what makes music great in the first place."
3,Food for thought,"I'm still not sure if I completely believe in the existance of time travel, but this did make it seem much more plausable to me. It makes sense that time travel would be harnessed by a civilization completely different from our own. I found this to be a very interesting concept."
5,Informative,"Informative Video, I did not know for sure if a Time Machine actually existed. Interesting to watch, the video describes the existance of a Time Machine that was constructed, but I will not let the Cat out of the bag !! Watch for yourself !!"
1,"No stars, don't buy,don't believe reviews, horrible!!!!!!!","This is awful, boring, a joke!!! I went to sleep!!! Really!!! Pure garbage!!! I put it in the trash can!!! Don't buy!!!"
3,Surgery in Space?,"An interview with author Terry Le Riche Walters who talks about his personal life experiences with extra-terrestrials--including surgery done outside of this planet--and his psychic abilities. The interviewer has a little trouble following, and the production is low tech, but he's a pretty interesting guy!"
3,Worth The Watch,"""The Alien Time Machine: Encounters From Another Dimension"" promises to be a true story. This claim is well intentioned. It is also, however, not entirely proven.Through the interviews offered from author Terry Le Riche Walters (famed for paranormal observations), ""Alien Time Machine"" provides viewers with a fascinating glimpse into extraterrestrial cultures. Walters details his own experiences with abductions and is highly entertaining--if not the source of much disbelief. His tales will fascinate individuals but will not succeed in swaying opinions. This will be a film to enjoy for its novelty, not its credibility.""Alien Time Machine"" will still become a favorite of those seeking more than the typical supernatural stories, though. Its quick pace, enthusiastic interviews and clever reenactments will please."
1,A very bad misleading translation.,"This translation is misleading because it is not authentic. The original meanings have been manipulated with.I recommend other more authentic translatios such as the translation of Yusuf Ali or the Oxford World's Classics. Those ones are very close to the original meaning in Arabic, but this one is not even close."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"Do not buy this, it stretches in the water and gets all wrapped up around the rollers in your humidifier, I ended up just throwing it in the trash !"
1,Very bad quality,I ordered 3 of these since they are not carried in the stores anymore. All 3 broke at the seam within 5 minutes of installing each one. The material these are made from is not as strong as it used to be and the seam is no longer reinforced. Would never buy these again; i had to buy an entirely new console humidifier with a wick-type filter.
5,candy buffet filler,I used the frooties as a part of a candy buffet for my friends baby shower and it worked out great. Bag was large enough that I was able to refill a medium/large size bowl two times.
5,Comprehensive and easy to use.,This is one of the best reference books I bought. It is easy to use and is laid out so I quickly find the perfect word for my needs.
4,Works well,"I needed a control for a large strobe I use in science experiments. This cotnroller was easy to figure out, works great, and came with lots of cord so setup was simple."
3,NECESITO SABER COMO UTILIZAR ESTE CONTROLADOR,"BUENAS AMIGO PENSE QUE ESTE CONTROLADOR TENIA POR LA PARTE DE ATRAS LAS TOMAS DE CORRIENTE PARA INSTALAR LOS ESTROBOS Y PARA MI SORPRESA NO FUE ASI, NECESITO QUE POR FAVOR ME AYUDE A ENTENDER COMO Y A DONDE CONECTO ESTE EQUIPO PARA PONERLO A FUNCIONAR, GRACIAS ESPERO SU RESPUESTA. Y NECESITO SABER SI ME HACE FALTA OTRO APARATO PARA HACER FUNCIONAR ESE CONTROLADOR..... ATTE. ENRIQUE FARFAN"
1,If you dont understand the manual....,"I bought this book because this was supposedly written for ""advanced"" users of Reason. Im halfway through reading this and I havent learned a thing. It goes through and identifies what all the knobs do and gives a very rudimentary explanation of audio recording and signal flow. I was expecting a book that would give more technique on how to get certain sounds, get better mixes, and how to really use and program the synths. The ""advanced"" material here has more to do with using the hotkeys than anything that has to do with audio. Plus I thought that with 532 pages there would be something I would learn. Nope, there are whole pages dedicated to screen shots of nothing but what appears in such-and-such a menu. If you own the manual, this book is a complete waste of time, money and bookshelf space."
2,"Dry and boring, but useful","I bought this book because I wanted to learn how to create great music using Reason 3.0, which is an amazing piece of software. I feel as if I could spend a lifetime experimenting with its different virtual sound modules, effects, and drum machines. Unfortunately, I thought this book was too dry, and more focused on various ""nuts and bolts"" of the software, instead of the artistry a composer can explore. I actually preferred the Lyford book, which performs a great walkthrough on building a song from scratch. This book also has a walk-through on building a song, but I didn't enjoy going through it as much."
4,"More info than previous (2.5) version, but worse typeface...","There's definitely more info here specifically covering the new features in Reason 3.0, but the ""readability"" has dropped. Even though 60 - 70% of the text is the same as the previous ""Reason 2.5 Power!"" edition, the typeface used has taken a turn for the worse. It's like somebody turned on a bold attribute at the start and forgot to turn it off. That's why I docked it one star. However, the book does a very good job covering all of the various Reason devices and effects."
2,Bad,Saw this guy at a seminar and thought he was asking way too much for his book so came here and got it inexpensively. Thank goodness. He needs new material and to grow more in life since his sorrowful childhood.
4,Slow starting,"Began slow, nearly gave up on it. Second half makes up for it, good book, would recommend it."
4,One of the Year's Best,"More killer music from Seattle. Featuring members of the Shins, the Murder City Devils, Scared of Chaka, and the Droo Church. With that pedigree you can guess the music. Smart and hard. Melodic and killer."
3,questionable track picks,"This is an OK sampler of Graham's early work, but how they could leave ""Howling Wind"" and ""Discovering Japan"" off this is mind-boggling, though the absence of the anti-Mercury Records ""Mercury Poisoning"" is easily understood given it's on Universal...the disc is ok if you need to get familiar with his work in a hurry, but really, if you are familiar with what's here and like it, you should pick up Howling Wind"", ""Heat Treatment"", and the magnificent ""Squeezing Out Sparks"". GP and the Rumour were quite a band - at their best, they rated up with EC and the Attractions."
4,Great mic,The sound quality on this mic is great im really glad i got it and for the value i got it. Definitely worth while.
4,A fair price for a decent kit,"These mics are a moderately good deal, given the price - but that may be the greatest selling point. Compared to other, higher-performing microphones, these mics don't really offer the same brilliance and colour in the sound they capture, but... for $70, it's a great kit to have on hand, or just to get started with your home studio."
3,"One Good Mic, One Bad","The 990 sounds very good for it's price, even sweetening the sound of my acoustic guitar. The 991 sounds alright, but its feedback sounds exactly like a tea kettle and just to get a signal, (not even close to into the yellow) the tea kettle noise is overwhelming. At first I thought it might be my mixer. But the same thing happened through my M-Audio Profire 2626 into Logic. The 991 isn't usable unless you feel like dedicating yourself to cutting out the higher frequencies of every recording. The built in mic on my Apogee One sounds leagues better than this piece of trash. But it's hard to complain when it comes with the 990 for under $100. The 990 sounds better to the ear, but less accurate then my SM57. Remember this is only a cost comparison, the SM57 is a dynamic mic. If you are new to recording, remember these mics (or any condenser) need phantom power. Peace and good luck!"
5,Sirius XS022,"I bought this as a replacement for a Stilleto 2. If you are like me , and don't use the recording, or pause feature on the stilleto then you will be happy with this unit."
5,1000 Generations Review,My husband and I absolutely love this CD. We can listen to this over and over again. A friend introduced us to 1000 Generations and so glad he did.
4,The right camera bag for one digital SLR and accessories...,"I needed a way to carry and protect my Canon s5 around with some batteries and a charger, but in a way that the camera and case could still fit inside a regular backpack or briefcase. The Tamrac bag is ""pouchlike"" in that it is belt-wearable, and is perfect for my needs. Fits my s5 with room to spare (you could probably fit a camera about 25% larger if you had to - but no room for any external lenses or anything much beyond one camera with a standard lens), and my AA battery charger fits in the pocket on the front. Under the flap is a zipper that closes the top of the bag, but if I've got the Tamrac slung over my shoulder, the top flap has a velcro patch to keep it closed if you are removing the camera frequently. A perfect accessory when a full-sized camera ""bag"" is too much, but you still want to carry and protect your investment."
4,Nice Bag for Nikon P80,My camera Nikon P80 fits well with this bag. It has large space so I can put other stuffs like battery charger and USB connector. It comes also with a small pouch at to put my backup battery and flash card. The only thing that I suggest is to add small pouches so I can organize camera stuffs.
3,Good case but big,"This was advertised with the Canon A590IS when purchased on Amazon. Didn't know the camera was so small, and the case is very large. I could have fit four of them inside. Case is built well, but too large for application. Returned for better sized case."
5,great camera bag,"I really like the size and shape of the bag. I got it for a medium sized digital camera - and it holds the cord, the charger, extra memory and batteries, a pen and a small notebook. Perfect for taking pictures at a meeting with notes - or for a day out with the camera, my license and some cash, to enjoy beauty!"
2,Tamrac 5230 T30 Photo/Digial Camera Bag,"If you are in a hurry to get to your camera for that ""Kodak moment"" forget it. The top makes it hard for you to get to quickly. It's good for storage or taking it on a trip. It doesn't have a whole lot of room or different compartments. I am looking for another one."
4,Very secure camera bag,"This camera bag is very secure. Not only can one zip the camera compartment closed, there's velcro and a clip to keep the bag closed. The second smaller compartment is great for accessories and batteries."
4,very sturdy,"very sturdy. pretty large. a bit too large for my needs, but nice. it has zipper, hook and velco. almost too secure! hard to get camera out, but i will never loose it.the pocket in front is great for extra batteries and stuff.nice product."
5,Great little bag for the price!,"Perfect size for my new Panasonic FZ28. Should work well with all super zooms. Extra pocket for cards and reader, battery, and charger."
4,Sturdy and roomy bag,"This is a good bag if you want to carry more than just your camera. This is a perfect size for the A-series Canon cameras - too big for compact Canons but too small for the Pro and S Series cameras. The front pouch easily stores 4 extra AA batteries, storage cards and a USB cable. The main compartment can hold the camera, battery charger and an instruction manual. The only thing I don't like about the bag is the clasp - it is rather difficult to open and close."
4,Great Bag - But a tad large for FZ28/35,"I got this bag sight unseen based on other Amazon reviewers glowing feedback related to FZ28/35. But be warned this bag is about 2 inches too tall for the FZ28/35. Unless you are going to try to put in alot of other stuff like filters or batteries (wrapped up somehow) you are wasting alot of space.My usage is to protect the FZ28 while it's tucked away in a day pack. And this case takes up way too much room unless I want to pack the extra accessories. So unless this bag is your only bag you are packing it is a fail for a match for FZ28/35 and other sized bodies. If you are looking for the minimalistic bag for this type of body as I was then go for something likeOP/TECH USA 7401034 D Series D-Offset Digital Camera Pouch - Black(You could also use both putting the op/tech inside this bag but then the main compartment will not have much room for other stuff.)For a standalone bag with accessories, it is fine, above average in the crowd of cases."
2,size mattersI,"I ordered this bag thinking it would be big enough to carry items that you would take along with the camera, well, it's too small to carry anything other than the camera itself. So I returned it."
4,Camcorder bag,The bag has plenty of space and it well constructed. A great compliment to my camcorder.
4,Nice combination pack,"I got this to refill my previous pack of grit that I received with my rock tumbler. All of them fit in the original jars and they work like a charm, so I can re-use my jars instead of chucking them out and getting new ones, and the quality of the grit and polishing material is very good."
4,Extra grit pack essential when purchasing tumbler,"An extra grit pack is essential when purchasing a tumbler since most tumblers come with enough grit for one run. This grit was economical, meets the needs of the tumbler I purchased, and seems to provide enough grit for 3-4 loads in the tumbler. I recommend this pack if you are going to get into tumbling with your kids. Just enough to keep it going for several tumbles which is about right for kids' attention spans."
2,does NOT ever get to a glossy polish,"These work fine for as far as they go, BUT you'd need another stage of polish to get a high gloss finish like my daughter wanted. It's easy enough to find the instructions for that online--can't remember what it was, but it had to do with liquid soap at the very end. I would recommend this package, BUT be prepared to do a little bit of research to find how to get the level of glossy finish you are looking for. The polishing process takes WEEKS to go through, so that would allow you plenty of time to find out whatever additional step you want to take. Or, if you aren't looking for high-gloss finish, but just very smooth polished stones (compare to satin finish versus semi-gloss or high gloss finishes for wall paint)."
3,Fun but not durable,"The Tee-Pees were easy to assemble and fun for the kids. The downside is that the floor poles are exposed and break due to the kids catching their foot as they go in and out the main door. Tunnel is durable, however the thick metal ribs that support the tunnel have no real cushion. Kids complain that it hurts their knees as the crawl through it. I took a crawl and came to the same result with my elbows. I'm now searching for replacement poles."
4,Great product....color choice?,"Replacing the AA batteries in our WII remotes was a hassle....particularly when we were out of batteries. This charging system is smart and effective. The kids know that it's up to them to make certain that the remotes make it into the charger if they want to play. We bought our first one a couple of years ago and it's still charging perfectly. One bummer....when making the AMAZON purchase it would seem that you were able to pick the color of the grip. This would be a nice feature, but when I made my purchase I could find no way of making this happen. I received 3 gray grips and 1 green one. Hope AMAZON fixes this."
5,Works great!,The battery has worked just as I expected. Note that I could not select the color of the battery cover. It was not a problem for me but if you have color requirement then it may turn out to be a problem for you.
4,Slick battery for the Wii,Purchased as a replacement to the original battery and charger. Functionality is great and works as promised on online store verbiage. Only negative is the battery cover is now grey rather than my old white so now my two chargers are different but something I have gotten used to over time.
5,Perfect for the Nyko Charger Set,This way you don't have to get another entire Nyko charger set. I'm not sure how long the rechargeable batteries last but i'm sure they eventually run out of juice. At $6.99 each you can't go wrong. I may even get some extras. Only bad thing is you cannot choose the color on the backing! I purchased one on 9/12/07 and rec'd a turquoise one.
2,Good for the first couple of months,This product worked extremely well the first month but after a while it stopped working. You place the battery in the charger and it would say that it's charged even when it wasn't. I even kept it in the charger for days it would not charge but yet the charge light would be green. Tried to contact Nyko and got no response or help at all. I even recommended the product to some friends and family members and they all ran into the same issue.Advice would be to charge it but keep it off the charging dock until it's completely drained before charging it again.
1,Dos not work on induction chargers sold at Costco,This does not work with all Nyko chargers as the package implies. It does not work on induction chargers.
2,Dosen't work with a standard Nuko charger - sold separately,"We had hoped that this battery pack woud work with our standard Nyko charging station (as we have 3 of them) but they don't work/aren't compitable. I think this is par for Nyko as I haven't been able to buy a battery pack that will sustain recharges over the test of time and by the time you go to purchase a replacement battery pack you have to buy another charging station. (In the long run, we're probably saving by not having to purchase batteries but it's crazy.)"
5,great replacement,"Our old batteries just weren't holding a charge anymore, and these replacements just popped right in and worked great. Really liked getting different colored batteries as now we can tell which one needs replaced, and of course my daughter loved that it was pink!"
1,WII battery kit for charge station,the description needs to be changed so the buyer knows ...that battery in the kit requires the controller to be placed in the charging station to charge ...the battery can not be placed independently in the charger to be recharged. Therefore it defeats the purpose of having an extra battery as the controller is needed to charge the battery.
3,Wii Battery Kit,If you play the Wii daily this product pays for itself in a month (batteries are expensive)
1,Would not recommend,"Bought this extra rechargable battery kit to go in our third Wii controller. Previously we bought the charger stand with two rechargable batteries in it, which works great. This battery barely fits into the controller (you have to jam it in) and then it does not properly charge. Unable to use:-("
5,They can't live without it!,The kids don't know what to do with their TV time if they are not playing on the Wii. I could not find a better deal than this!Wii Charge Station
5,Wii Battery Kit,It is hard to find the battery kit without the battery charger. I wanted to say thanks to Amazon.
4,Batery Works For At Least A Year Or SO,"The batery works great, except that the batery can only be rechargable for at least a year or so. Until then, everything works fine, so don't think this batery can be infinitely be recharged.Same goes for the Wii chargers."
5,awesoe,"item is what i wanted, it fits perfectly and it is way easier instead of using regualr batteries. my 5 year old son charges the batteries himself."
1,LOOKS THE SAME but Does Not Work with All NYKO chargers,"Be Careful! Although the replacement battery pack looks almost exactly the same, it does not work with the NYKO IC Charge Base. Apparently, it only works with a NYKO ""Charge Station"" which has a different way of charging. I have yet to find the right battery pack for a NYKO IC Charge Base."
4,good idea,I received the charger with the gray cover. Very boring. I was hoping for a different color but I knew that I could receive any color including gray. Charging it was no problem and so far I have not had any problems with the rechargable battery. It is definitely a great idea because you don't have to replace dead batteries. Just recharge them. So far I am happy with this purchase.
2,stat battery kit,Wii charger stat battery kit was order because my wii controller was working right. My wii controller still didn't work with the battery kit so it was a waste of money.
5,Love me some wax,"If you like to style your hair, this is the way to go. The wax does what it tells you to do. I've gone through many products and this by far is the best in this price range. It all very well may depend on the type of hair you have and mine is thick. So this product may not yield the same results, don't know. I've been using it for years however, Wal Mart stopped carrying it in my area, so I had to resort to ordering it online and it came sooner than expected. Only issue is that it does make your hands feel sticky if you run them through your hair in frustration, as in my case on occassion because im so sO SO ANGRY!!, where other products do not leave that feeling."
1,Nina,i never received the product and getting my money back took a while. speaking to customer service was annoying because i constantly repeated myself.
4,A good hair wax,Was looking for something to replace my hair wax that just ran out (have been using L'Oreal Indestructible Sculpting Wax but can't seem to find it anywhere). Took a gamble on this small obscure looking green colored wax and boy was I pleased! Holds ur hair in place and gives you the peicey/ faux hawk look. Hair feels a bit hard though but that's ok. Washes out considerably easily too.
1,IDK!?!?!?!?!,I ordered this book over a month ago and still have yet to receive it. I don't know why I never received the book. The book itself I hear is a good book though. I bought it for class and my classmates said it wasn't a terrible read
4,Environmental Planning,"I am a student in environmental planning and have found this book to be extremely useful. It address a variey of things such as watershed, storm discharge, streamflow, etc. It really gives the reader an idea of how to design with nature."
2,Required reading,"This book was mandatory for a class. I read the first chapter and it was very repetitive and boring. I think we used it once for class, if I could go back in time I would not buy this book."
5,good,"it's cheap and fast. this one is just new, even newer than some of those on the shelf for sale. yeah, rating is always the best standard for us buyers."
5,Highly recommended,"The Makaha Sons sing these ""Hapa Haole"" ballads in matchless harmony to the accompaniment of crisply-recorded acoustic guitars & ukeleles. Highlights include Kui Lee's ""Lahaina Luna"", ""Blue Hawaii"", ""Hawaiian Wedding Song"". Best Hawaiian CD of 2000. Q: Now that the Grammys give awards for nearly every other kind of music, when will they recognize Hawaiian music?"
2,By far the worst I've seen in the series.,"I've thoroughly enjoyed the other videos in this series, but this one was unfocused and more than a little boring at times. Rather than focusing on the accomplishments and personalities of the Fertile Crescent, it looks at some of the archaeology that was done nearly 100 years ago and then makes spends an inordinate amount of time comparing Biblical texts to Mesopotamian records.Very disappointing, especially when compared to the rest of the series."
3,Small window into Panama,"A film with good a positive vibe & spirit, but the window is too small to get much of a feel for Panama or the surf landscape. A short trip with unexceptional surf and surfing. If your'e traveling to Panama might be worth the watch. Not much of a ""guide"". The film does entice one to go. Entertainment value is mediocre."
1,Tool never to use.,"First the handle, to put pressure on it is bad,no way. do not have a proper grip.Second the carbide wheel is very small and not steady.third and last, the whole tool is cheap."
3,not to be confused...,"Having purchased this cd thinking it was the Japanese experimental band Ghost (as written even here!), I was a little disappointed to discover that it is actually the NY band The Ghost. This is probably great stuff for those into more hardcore music, but if you're looking for the elongated noises of psychedelic soundscapes created by the Japanese group, keep looking!"
5,BEST BAND EVER,"Buy this now, i have owned this cd for over a year. it is definitly one of the best i own. thier new album should be coming out feburary or so. just do the damn thing"
5,replacement for OEM Shocks,Excellent shocks for replacing your OEM shocks. You will notice the better handling and ride immediately!You will have to spend 2X as much to find a better product.Monroe has been making great products for a long time in the history of cars and trucks!
3,So-so Journey into the Heart of Darkness,"I picked up this book because of the author's last work which was very good. This book, however, was quite dissappointing. It lurches from lurches from interesting material to incredibly dull material (something that one wouldn't think possible due to the tome's subject matter of trying to obtain a ""snuff film""). Svoray's other book, ""In Hitler's Shadow"", was much better."
2,save your money,"This book is little more than a string of the author's fruitless meetings with vaguely underworld character, each of which leads to the next. it reads like a poorly-written roadguide, with the author boucing around from one city to the next, until nearly the end. Billed as non-fiction, this book is alternately too contrived and cliche, or too superficial to be anything other than make-belief. There must be better, more serious books on the subject."
3,if you look hard enough you'll find anything,"anyone whos' seen faces of death or its sequals will know that there are films of people being murdered. Take the Jim Jones cult for example. California congressman Leo ryan was gunned down in full view of the tv cameras, along with the cameraman, which was broadcast all over the world. Svorays discovery of the neo nazi movement was no surprise, because it isn't so hard to believe. If Svoray discoverd a secret lab where they crossbreed men with bears and horses and have a whole farm full of man-monsters, then I'd be shocked. But snuff films are no surprise. There are many who would kill a person on camera in exchange for money."
2,Shooting for the stars...,"...this endeavour narrowly avoids plummeting to Earth.As it is, it's just not all that good. By all means, do not pay full price for this book. Like the other reviewers, I will not spoil the 'ending', and I will also say that there is hardly a shred of evidence or compelling presentation to make you really believe this is all true.It's not investigative journalism. It's not entirely schlock, but it certainly is not the compelling story as promised by the slipcover.The story is littered with all sorts of events, but not a shred of documentation; he even states that he avoids a lot of truth by changing names, places, times, events. Sadly, this also destroys what little credibility the story has. Even the name-dropping he does, doesn't carry much weight (and you'd think Robert De Niro's name would carry some weight, no?)It's not a waste of time... but it's not the gripping story that one hopes it would be."
1,*Ahem*,"""...so after quickly infiltrating the Russian mob, I flew back to London to take a call from my friend, the criminal, who gave me the number of an L.A. gang member he knew who kinda remembered being in a snuff film. I decided to take the bold approach -- posing as a buyer -- and told everyone 'you don't know who you're messing with.' and it worked! Everyone gave me names and numbers of people they knew who would be happy to sell me a snuff film!""So I flew back to New York to watch another snuff film.... blah blah blah""This book is a load of poo-poo."
4,Up to Snuff,"I did my senior research paper on the ""urban legend"" of snuff films, this book helped me immensly ! Easy reading cover-to-cover; I commend Yaron Svoray for the work he has done to help publicise the atrocities he witnessed while researching. Anyone interested in the workings of the underworld should read this book."
1,Not worth it!,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this ring. It is small, very light in weight, and looks dull, cheap and fragile. You cannot see the features clearly on the ring as is shown in the picture. If I had seen this ring in person, I definitely would not have bought it as it certainly was not worth $89.00!"
4,Great knife,"I have had one of these knives for years and absolutely loved it. I've used it multiple times for camping and also for barn tasks. The blade keeps a nice edge and the serrated section comes in handy. The only slight drawback is that the black rubber trim shows wears over time towards the hinge, which is where it is the thinnest. Overall a great knife."
2,ho speeder derails and costs too much to return,"Speeder was finickey on ho rails-derailed easily on turnouts. More trouble to try to run than its worth. Having to pay return shipping of almost $12.00 made it a very big disappointment and an expensive trial. Also, I have not yet heard of my request for credit on my return. I will not order from 'Best Buy' stores again thru Amazon unless they include free return shipping.You can regain my trust by crediting me the $12.00.plus all the expense I incurred to buy the thing in the first place."
3,Does not know anything about Gifted Kids,"I saw Hal on Matt Lauer.While he may be on topic on raising kids, he is appallingly ignorant when it comes to gifted kids.As a former gifted child and a parent of a gifted kid, I'd like to weigh in.Gifted kids are at great risk for psychological problems if their gifts are not recongnized and they are not accelerated. What Hal proposed is not the recommended approach for dealing with gifted kids and will very likely lead to the kids being stunted emotionally and mentally.Interested parents should look up Dr Ruf's book as a starting point on raising gifted kids, rather than listen to an ill-informed person who is out of their area of expertise.Losing Our Minds: Gifted Children Left Behind"
4,I wouldn't shout about this one from the rooftops.,"I'm trying to practice these methods on our dogs while we're waiting for a child, but it's not as easy as he makes it sound. Good concepts, and I think he's right, but he really didn't give much advice on how to implement his ideas."
1,Just opinions - save your $,"OK I have read a lot of parenting books and constantly struggle with the right thing to do. I do yell too much, as many parents do, and I was looking for a way to stop and DIRECTIONS on how to, and ""how to"" disciplinary techniques. Although I agree with most of what this author says, and he gives some examples he gives no clear cut how to ""put in action"" tools - just a reference to his next book, seminars, etc - a way for him to make more money. All of his thoughts and ideas are things I have heard before in many parenting books. None of it is revolutionary! And he is constantly repeating the same thing. Don't waste your money!!!!!"
3,"good, but needs more","After feeling like I was in over my head with my two toddler boys, I bought this book hoping it would help. I do like the two chapters, 8 and 9 discussing following through with consequences. Otherwise, I just wish that there were more examples throughout the book. He would tell a story and then kind of leave you hanging as to what would be a good way to handle it. I felt like I was always waiting for more..."
5,Great Advice!,I had reservations about some of the early ideas introduced in this book. But I stuck with it and ended up agreeing with the concepts once I understood the context. I would recommend this book to anyone with young to teenage kids.
5,A must for all parents,"The thing that seperates this book from all other parenting books is that it is principle-based rather than reaction-based. It is not, ""if your kid does this , you do this"" book. The best book I have ever read for parenting. It has changed the way my wife and I parent, and has changed our children for the better. We constantly get complimented on how ""good"" our children are, and I attribute much of that to this book."
4,Great Resource,"This book is a good, no nonsense approach to managing discipline in your house. Once you understand the key point, ""Take care of yourself so others don't have to."" it all makes sense."
1,Basic premise is to calm down & adopt a permissive stance.,"This book was repetitive and idealistic. Wouldn't we all jus love to ""calm down?"" Easier said than done when I think about being hen pecked by my three children (7 year old twins & 4 year old). The entire beginning of the book seemed to suggest adopting a flat & detached approach to even the most anxiety provoking situations. For example, the author talks about his 2 year old son climbing the outside of the staircase close to falling 6 feet onto a hardwood floor. The author proceeds to report that not only did he control his anxiety in responding...he actually closed his eyes before retrieving his son. I'm not sure how that scenario is humanly possible. Overall, the book was disappointing & focused mostly on adolescence. If I could, I would get my money back."
2,"Too much talking, Not enough action","I am in the process of listening to this book on CD. The first four chapters are so boring that I find my mind wandering off thinking of other things. By chapter 5 it gets a little better, but but not much. The 1 star reviews are right on in that there is no ""HOW"" in this book... just lots of blah, blah, blah. The author tells a long story about how he disciplined her daughter for walking on the outside of an indoor staircase in the living room. He took her down and calmly told her that was off limits. But did she ever do it again? Did she do it when her mother was home and her father was out? Then he explains that he found his two year old son at the stop of the steps on the outside of the railing, six feet above the living room floor. He calmly removed him. But that's it.... I'm waiting and wondering how he disciplined him. Did the 2 year old ever do it again."
4,Good Book,Interesting Approach to dealing with kids...I definitely took away some ideas/principles but it isn't the book of books on the subject.
1,wow a book with only 1 page of good info.,"I've never seen a self improvement book that does less to guide you to overcome your problem. The author must have ADD. He seemed to lose sight he was writing a book instead of just rambling for his own entertainment. He might be fine therapist in person but, his book just bounces around and doesn't seem to give any kind tips, or suggestion to help. It just make you feel bad for when you've lost you temper and have screamed.I feel like this author has screwed me over. He got my money and my time with a book that could be summed up in about 1 page of very to the point suggestion.Don't waste your money.I'll sum it up- Don't yell at your kids, give them personal space, try and let them made decision on there own and don't label them."
1,Not what I was hoping for!,"I bought this book for myself hoping that I could stop my yelling at my kids. While I did get some good stories I really didn't get much in the way of ""how to"" change. It mainly focuses on me and only me. I was also looking for other methods of discipline or how to remain calm when I am about to lose it. One of the best tips I ever got was from a forum. One member said when you are feeling like you are about to blow just walk away and go to your own space and calm down. Now why couldn't something like this be in the book!! It was more helpful than anything I read here. Definately a waste of money for me :("
1,Screamfree Parenting: The Revolutionary Approach to Raising Your Kids by Keep Your Cool,I was so disappointed by this book...The philosophy of giving your kids space so that they can make their own mistakes and experience natural consequences is great...but the book is really weak on practical applications...I wish there was there was a chapter with realistic scenarios and how to apply the principles of this book to those parenting challenges...back to the shopping cart for me....
5,The BEST Parenting book ever,"I have read my far share of parenting books and this is the BEST. I have bought this book for all my friends and family and they all love it too. I have 2 children under the age of 8yrs and one is a hand full at times. This book reminds you that you have the power to change you and your child will see and feel the changes in you, with this the cycle of behavior changes in your child and in your relationship. This is a MOST READ!!!!"
1,Feel like being talked down to?,"Then this is your book. I could not get past ""let me repeat myself"" and ""let me say that again."" I am not an idiot and don't need every significant point that the author thinks he's making repeated to me. I read maybe 20 pages of this and could not continue. The author's tone suggests that the reader of this book constantly looses their cool and yells at their child. Like most parents, I do loose my cool sometimes but I didn't appreciate the condecending tone from this author. I have an incredibly difficult 3 year old who fights everything all the time and was looking for some ideas for how to better handle her. I am now reading ""Parenting the Strong Willed Child"" and am finding the authors tone to be much more my style."
4,remarkable book,I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others for self help. I am going to give it to my daugter who is a screaming parent to raise her two kids!
5,Amazing insight!!!!!!,"My husband and I have listened to this to improve in our parenting of our five children. It has been life changing and a God sent! It gives insight and learning that we agree with but just didn't know how to implement. For example, We always tell our kids that you decide how to act, respond, and feel when it comes to yourself. It is great how the book/cds teach parents to do the same and set the example and stop being part of unsuccessful patterns."
2,"A little boring and dull, unrealistic","I thought this book was a little unrealistic. Kids need space, not not so much so to where they're going to be able to make thier own decisions for themselves. Some children are too young and need help of adults to make decisions. Not that you're going to make every waking decision for them like robots, but you have to pick your battles. The book was a little boring and hard to get through. I don't recommend this book."
3,ready .... aim .... aim .... aim ...,"I'll admit that I'm only half way through the book and I'm writing this review. If I get through the whole book, I'll edit this review. But I feel like there is so much time being spent talking about how we should want to be scream-free parents (I know ... I get it ... that's why I picked up the book.) Now give me the meat already. What are the techniques?? Should have been hitting those way earlier on. I hope I can hang on a little longer ..."
3,EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS,"INTERESTING. MAKES SENSE BUT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH. HOWEVER, IF YOU CAN STICK WITH IT IT JUST MIGHT CHANGE YOUR SITUATION DRAMATICALY!"
1,Keep Looking,"I knew within the first few pages that this book was not going to be a staple in my library. I wasn't looking for earth-shattering advice, merely a little guidance as a first-time parent. I didn't find this book of very much use, and think it would better serve as an opinionated ARTICLE, not a whole book.At times I found the author condescending, very frustrating. Some of the ideas he suggests are just plain ludicrous too. Suggesting that showing pride in our kids is telling them THEY own US. I wouldn't put too much weight on any parenting book, as each person needs to exhibit common sense and develop their own methods that work for them, but as I said - it's good to get a little guidance or some helpful hints to supplement along the way.This book had neither, keep looking!"
5,Scream Free Parenting,Fabulous book. I am going to a seminar to hear the author speak. I am almost finished with the book and it has helped a lot. I am a teacher and it is great for my classroom as well! Definitely a must read for parents - the sooner the better. They have a great website as well.
5,Challenging & insightful!,"I read a review that stated this book ws not 'action oriented'. I disagree. The 'action' is changing the parent's behavior BEFORE changing the child's. I have read ""7 Worst Mistakes (Good) Parents Make"" and ""The Well-Behaved Child"" and this is a different angle on the subject. Though an outline of predetermined consequences is not provided, it does clearly identify what a healthy child needs from a parent in 'tense times'. It reveals the immaturity in the 'reactive' parenting and calls the grown ups to lead by example. It was tough to hear, but stated in a way that got through the crap society teaches us. (i.e., ""our kids' struggles are caused by everyone else BUT the parents"")"
2,Better Books Out There,"This book recommends keeping your cool, but it doesn't give specific tips on how to control anger or how to discipline kids (other than using consequences/punishments). I strongly recommend reading Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles: Winning for a Lifetime by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka instead. Another good book is How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish."
5,Finally! ScreamFree has arrived!,I have been following the author and this book for a while. So glad to have read this book!Keep up the good work Hal!
1,bad.,"This book turned me off completely in the first chapter. As the author is describing his experience of screaming at his 2 year old in the parking lot of the waffle house for dropping his food on the floor (something that any parent knows every toddler does) I realized their was no way I could take parenting advice from someone who would do this to thier child--even as an example of what not to do. Also, very heavy on the whole ""god"" crap."
3,maybe for parents with kids a little older,"I think that this is a good book for people with children about 5 and up. I have a two year old and did not read much that will help us get passed the ""terrible two's"" but I did read a lot that might help us un the future. I would suggest holding out for a used copy or get it from the library."
5,Trainer / Coach,There is no better parenting book out there. Highly recommended. I've shared this book with many others.
5,Scream Free Parenting - Hal Runkel,"This is a great book. It teaches you how to deal with the littlest of kids to the extremely challenging teenager. We have implemented a lot of his suggestions, and life at home is getting much better!"
4,Great book!,"This is a fantastic, thoughtful book. I read it in one sitting and was amazed at how relevant it is to my own life. The only thing keeping me from rating it a 5 was that I found myself several times asking ""how"" and wanting more examples or strategies to use than were presented. When one has spent a lifetime being ""ScreamFilled"" it can be hard to imagine how to become ""ScreamFree."" Still, the ideas Runkel talks about are powerful and thought-provoking, and I look forward to putting them into practice."
2,I can't relate to this book.,"I returned it after reading 3 chapters. Yes, it had a FEW good (but obvious) points, but for the most part, I just couldn't relate, nor did I want to. It seemed a bit unrealistic. Maybe it gets better as you get further in to it, but I lost interest when the stories started annoying me."
2,"Too long winded...get to the point, please.","This book has some good advice. But it takes too long to read through the author's stories and rhetoric, to get to the point of his discussions. Then, there really isn't any solid advice. I wasn't impressed but I guess it is because I'm really looking for advice right now."
1,Amazon.com is terrible,"I am hugely dissapointed! I ordered this book for my birthday as a treat and discovered a week later that Amazon had canceled my order!! They gave absolutely no reason for it, (no it was not a problem with my credit card) so i assume it is because i got it for 68 dollars(cheap) as it is now 600 dollars!!!!!!!! 600! Totally insane, I imagine it would have been a nice book though."
5,Actually I didn't buy this so I don't know why it's here,"You can't go wrong with Harry Potter. However I didn't buy this book, I did buy the English one and it's fantastic as all of the books are."
2,"Bad, mostly unfunny, stupid and has a lot of filler.","While season 2 part 1 of ""Shin Chan"" has some funny moments, they are few and far between and most of the show consists of filler and stupid/unfunny jokes. Don't get me wrong ""Shin Chan"" is a good, funny anime but season 2 of it sucks ass. IF you wish to watch ""Shin Chan,"" watch season 1 of it instead. Skip this crap. 2.5/10"
3,"Not Great but not Bad, Disappointed","Shin Chan is a great show yet I feel like Season Two part one was not as great as the complete season one. If you want to collect all of them go ahead but if you want to try and get the best ones, try to make this one of the last ones you get.P.S. The Star Wars Parody was the WORST EPISODES they had in there. I dont know what the other user was talking about since I felt it was a complete waste of time watching it."
3,Blueprints is Basic,"Blueprints in Pediatrics is definitely a quick read. Good for preparing brief presentations and boning up on important topics. However, it is NOT a good prep for the boards. Much too basic. However, I recommend carrying it around for reading when you have breaks throughout the day while on your Pediatrics rotation."
2,Not recomendable for USMLE preparation,"I think this book is good for a quick review during the Pediatric rotation, but not advisable for USMLE preparation. While this book covers the important diseases, the points that it emphasizes does not reflect the content of the exam. Even if you have learned everything this book presents, you still cannot answer many exam questions in the area. On the other hand, it does give you the big picture, so it would be good for a quick general review."
3,Book title,The title of this book is what got my attention. It was not exactly what I expected. but interesting anyway.
5,Great Product !,The Cable Clamps are great to organizes cables and make them neat at the same time.Would def. recommend this item.
4,Yquatine's demise,"Fitz is stranded on a doomed planet, with about a month left before its mysterious demise. Now he has to fend for himself as he tries to escape that fate, unless he decides to team up with a girl named Arielle.Constance has gone off the deep end--literally--after the Doctor installed a randomizer into her systems, a brutal attack on her sense of self. The Doctor, having lost both of his companions, feels overwhelmed as he deals with the political fallout of Yquatine's destruction. And things are only going to get worse...Another great Who story."
4,The Rise of Nick Walters,All I want to say is that The Fall of Yquatine by Nick Walters is a very good book. It far surpasses his previous Dr. Who novel Dominion in every category. This book is a must have for all Doctor Who fans. May Mr. Walters continue to write great Doctor Who!
4,Nice little trolley car,"First I'll say that I was totally unimpressed by the description on this website so I awaited the arrival of this item with some apprehension. The description of how a cable car works in San Francisco means absolutely nothing to the actual use of this car on an HO scale model train layout. All that was necessary to say was that this is an excellent self propelled, stand-alone trolley car. It runs very well on an HO track. I am completely satisfied with this item and I will probably order the red version of this trolley without any further apprehension at all."
4,Neat looking clock,"Is it art or is it a clock? Well, it's both. The power cord is a little short, I wanted to hang this on the wall but unless the spot is directly above the plug forget it. Other than that this is a unique clock."
2,Disapointing,"I got this game 2 weeks ago and was very excited, because i have NFL 2K5 and hoped that this game would be just as good.The actual gameplay is not the greatest, I was very disapointed by how it turned out. I liked the legacy mode because it let me really get the feeling that i was the coach with all the recruiting.Another thing that i didnt like was the fact that you didnt get the actual names of the current players.Hopefully next year Sega will have more time to work on this game since EA Sports has exclusive rights to NFL Stuff.I look forward to next year as long as they improve it tremendously."
3,Why does this game have to make up name,Yes I like this game but well you probably heared Gerry Mcnamara well on this game sometimes they say his name is john smith or josh little or somthing like that you will find this out when you go to practice mode or to the roster. They also change the rating around a little bit. I mean one time 3pt rating is 90 the next it 86 or something.
2,fun game with setbacks,"This game has many positive aspects that you can chose from like legacy mode which lets you create a coach and coach a smaller team like Alcorn State. The main flaw that I found was the free-throw shooting. I shot close to 20 free throws in one game and I made 1. All you do is hold onto the A button and pray you make it. I was down by 1 with 5 seconds left in the NCAA tournament and I clanked both free throws off the iron to lose by 1. The game is very realistic. The fight songs, cheerleaders, and the crowd create a very life like atmosphere. Also the gameplay is very realistic. You cannot just throw up 3s and make them all the time, you must actually work for a good shot. Another drawback is the NCAA tournament. I simulated the games and I ended up with 3 of 4 of the number 2 seeded teams losing in the first round. The simulations are very unrealistic with too many unreal upsets. Overall, I would not suggest buying this game."
1,waste of money,"The Panic Mouse is such a let down.These wands don't really connect to the unit, so they just yank out with enough force. And my 10 month old cat had enough force to do it! What a bad design."
3,Wonderful toy. The first day.,"My cats went bonkers over the Panic Mouse when I first turned it on, but they quickly developed a tolerance to it. One cat now lies on the floor in front of it and passively whaps it when the mouse wand moves past him. Another cat sits still and allows the wand to ""pet"" him. A couple other cats quiver in the background and watch the wand spin around with eyes like pinwheels, but they do not interact with it, no matter how fast or slow I set the toy. Perhaps it is the loud whirring noise that puts them off.The Panic Mouse seems sturdy and relatively well made, so I don't plan to write it off just yet. I think younger or more active cats would enjoy this cat toy more than older, lazy cats who just want to be adored. From a safe distance.To date, the best cat toy that gets regular use (and maintains interest) isDa Bird Interactive Feather Cat Toy. That and crumpled up balls of aluminum foil and the string that was once attached to my kitchen timer."
5,Wish I could use it!,"The Panic Mouse Replacement Wand looks wonderful and I feel quite sure my cats would have loved it. Unfortunately, the Panic Mouse 360 that I bought did not work. So the replacement wand could not be used!"
4,Good file.,"Having purchased other Nicholason files from the local big box home stores I was looking for a file with an attached handle; this was it. I intend to use it on axe's, hatchets, etc. for sharpening. File came from Tool King in great condition. The only reason it's getting four stars is it's made in Mexico; this was a surprise to me. I buy Nicholson's because they're, usually, made in the US - all my other Nicholson's are. I'm going to contact Nicholson to see what's up, if they're transferring production to Mexico I'm going to get more of the US made files soon as I'd rather have a supply of good US products than sub-standard foreign products.Get one soon I guess before they're made in China like all the crappy files are."
4,tool hanger,"On the plus side, the tool hanger is sturdy and compact. It does a good job of providing hanging space for about five garden tools. On the minus side, the prongs are too shallow and two wide to hold more than one tool."
5,Simple Solution for hanging Rakes and Brooms,"Works great - Simple and effective, solid and functional for hanging rakes, brooms, etc., easy to install and very reasonably priced"
4,Great Price,"I was skeptical based on the price, but after hanging all my garden tools 10+ I am happy to say it worked out great. The spacing or number of slot could be better for larger rakes but I would buy another one at this price if needed."
4,Garden Tool Hanger,This is a basic plastic tool hanger but serves my needs quite well. I have been able to organize my garage quite well and not break the bank doing it.
2,Too Little - Not Very Strong - Cannot Support Heavier Tools,"I installed this Hanger 2 years ago, Nov 2009. There are 2 issues with this hanger. 1st - When I originally installed the hanger it seemed very sturdy and solid but it does not do well with things constantly hanging on it... The final result is the plastic mold itself will crack around the screws. I would say, this hanger is good for about 30lbs constant weight. I know it is probably rated to support a higher weight capacity but it just doesn't. The 2nd issue is the Prongs are too shallow. Heavier tools will very easily slip off and fall to the ground with or without touching them. I actually just threw out this hanger (in pieces) 11/21/11 and I am now on Amazon looking for a new hanger."
3,rip off,"this is a great product, but way over priced for my amazon expectations. cheaper at many other places."
3,"Good overview, no details",The book gives a good overview about the topic. It is easy to read and allows even readers with no or little computer background to understand the basic principles. On the other hand the text is not suited for people with a sound streaming media background. It stays on the top level and does not help very much if you want to implement something by yourselves.
1,misrepresentation,It does not present what the buyer expects. It is more a video transmission history. I have the equipment. I was looking for a guide to streaming.
2,WHAT?,"I recently purchased this book along with another zone book to get me started on the program. This book LOOKED like it would be helpful for me, but after paging through it I realized how wrong I was. I agree with the majority of the reviews listed here. The measurements are incredibly strange, and many general, everyday foods are missing. I would still like to try the zone, but I will be returning this book as soon as possible."
1,What a Waste of Money!,"I was delighted when I saw this book in the bookstore. Fortunately, I thumbed through it and thus avoided the mistake of buying it. I thought I must not be reading the measurements correctly because surely anyone could see that this method of measurement would render the information almost useless. I think somebody is in too much of a hurry to make money and is not thinking about the readers. Whoever is responsible for this book should be ashamed. At least they didn't get MY money."
1,Forget it!!,Desperate need of a good editor. I hope Dr. Sears finds someone who knows what they are doing next time he writes another book. This book was no help at all and very confusing. Returned mine for a refund.Liz
2,Informative,"This book is informative introductary wise , however to me it is to much of a hassel to follow, you'd have to be like a robot to keep up with this information; I say to just maintain a healthy lifestyle and there won't be a need for this book; It's a good this i didn't pay much for it."
1,Zone help line says book will be revised because of errors,After noting several mistakes I called the help line. They weren't real helpful. Said that book contains many errors (including the one I was asking about - Zone preferred items were suppose to be checked) and that a revision was in the works with no idea when it would be out. She suggested I return the book for a refund. GOOD ADVICE! If there are so many errors they should do a recall!!
5,sweet cd!,for all those lover's rock fans this is must to have cd by snachez very sweet cd so get it!
2,Not Sure,This product either doesn't work for me or my skin has developed a resistance to it.I'm still having the same problem after opening my second tube of the 3 purchased
4,"Not Really Based On ""Jokes""","The reviewer who gave this book only one star seems to have been anticipating a great number of punchlines in this book. There aren't that many. The book isn't based on ""jokes"" as such but on wry, pithy obsevations of the world at large, seen through the lens of Leyner's sense of the absurd. If you want ""jokes,"" there are plenty of books like that out there. This book is not for a general audience anyway -- it takes a special outlook to even appreciate this book -- but for those with the mind set to appreciate this kind of humor, while it may not be falling-down funny, it is enjoyable."
4,Dick-Lit has finally arrived,"IF you have ever wondered what life is like for the filthy rich pornographers of the world - this is a great guilty pleasure of a novel. It's a fun, quick read about a pornographer with a heart of gold. The descriptions of the main character's incredible wealth coupled with his scathing commentary on the others in his economic class makes this book a hilarious read."
5,Just what it feels like to be a single again man,"I would read Levien's shopping lists, that's how well written this book is. Even if the plot hadn't have been great, which it was and even if I hadn't have found myself in the book quite a few times, which I did, and even if I hadn't have thought that the charactors were so well written that I actually looked for Swagbelly the magazine on the rack, which I did; I'd still have loved the book.The writing was artistic and beautiful.The only problem that I had with the book was the ending. However, it's been several weeks since I finished and now I even like how Levien closed the book. Simply put, life goes on. You make the most of it and keep trodging along.Seperated, divorced, think you could be at some point? Read this book."
4,SWAGBELLY FOR READING,"Swagbelly is a magazine for men, pron really owned by Elliot Grubman and so the story goes. This is a peek into to mid life crisis(?) or his life, as good as money can by. Hard to feel sorry for him but you do. Worth the read. David Levien can right. RECOMMENDED"
2,waste of time and money,"It starts off well but then goes downhill very quickly. It is just constant praise from the authors (whom I think probably got a lifetime of free tickets for sucking up so much). It gets way too boring and repetitive to make for interesting reading. If you are interested in looking at a 330 page written informercial, then this is it. Although I love the airline, I couldn't recommend this book to anyone"
2,"Love the Company, Hate this Book",I am a big fan of SWA but this book is almost unreadable. It's like a Christmas card to a loved one that goes on and on and on and on to the point of being just stupid and embarassing.
3,"Some good observations, too much boosterism.","SWA is clearly a reamrkable company and the authors manage to communicate that and the reasons why in the first 50 pages. After that it's basically self-promoting, sentimental fluff. You may find yourself rapidly skimming more than 3/4 of this book."
5,nuts! about this book,"This product came in just fine when I got it, I was thankfull that I got It the day they said it would be shipped because I really need the book for my class. The book was not intact and it came in good condition just like it said it would. Hopefully this review helps, if it doesn't then sorry. =D"
5,Nuts About Nuts,"This is a great book, not only about the formation of Southwest Airlines, but about life in general. So many of the thoughts expressed are great for everyday living!"
4,A Southwest Employee writes Read this Book,"Well being with Southwest for several years, I must say the notion of a entire book being devoted to a airline does seem a little too much. But after reading I have recommended it to alot of people in the business world. There is alot that can be learned from job satisfaction. I as well as my co-workers feel like a family each and every day we go out of our way to make OUR customers feel welcome as well as making sure we get them to where they need to go. Everything you will read about is true. These two authors researched our Culture really well. Herb is like a Dad to all of us, If you fly Southwest thanks we luv your business. ---JB"
3,Good Management + Business book,This book should be made mandatory for every SWA employee or SWA fan but other than that I wouldn't recommend it to anybody else because they will grow bored after a few chapters.
2,It felt like I was reading a Book Report,"It just seemed like someone opened an encyclopedia and started copying from it. The book was also too ""one sided"", I think it is ok to talk about the not so positive aspects of a company without making the company out to be a villain. It felt like a 329 page ""feel good"" ad."
3,Too long and repetitive,The book is great but loses it by repeating itself.If they took out a third to a half it would be a racy wonderful read but it becomes cumbersome and you tend to leave out sections.The whole story is so uplifting and fantastic that it deserves a better shorter version.
2,Mediocre writing,"I bought the book on a recommendation from a management trainer. Very disappointing! Whereas Southwest airlines, their customer relations and their business model are certainly interesting, this book is not. The authors of Nuts! managed to bore after 20 pages. Nuts! could easily have been compressed into 50-80 pages by eliminating all repetition and fluff. What bothered me most was the uncritical Rah Rah cheerleader style of the authors, who used any example at hand to make the point they wanted, no matter how little the example supported that (on occasion the same example is used in different chapters of the book to make two logically opposed points).I am giving the book two points because I enjoyed reading customer letters and transcripts from Southwest Airlines. Those were much more instructive than the prose of the two authors.If the book had been the entertaining read it promised to be judging from the reviews, I wouldn't have minded the absence of content as much."
1,Didn't read much of this,"My airline career spanned nearly 20 years and I'm very familiar with Southwest. It's a great company, and my low opinion of this book has nothing to do with Southwest and everything to do with fluff being passed off as serious reading. Any legitimate study must examine the subject objectively and present the whys and wherefores of the company's positives and negatives. This reads as if it was authored on Southwest's company stationery, so if you want to know how and why Southwest is in the industry leading position it is, you'll need to look elsewhere. An excellent start would be Lamar Muse's hard-to-find-but-worth-looking-for ""Southwest Passage,"" an entertaining autobiography that really shines as a fascinating look behind the scenes during Southwest's early years. Muse played a critical but little-known leadership role that he describes in detail and documents extensively with excerpts from actual correspondence and reports."
2,"Cheap fabric, rips all the time","I must've gone through at least 3 or 4 of these changing pads in my daughter's first year. They wipe up easily but the fabric is super cheap and rips all the time. This is the only changing pad that fits perfectly with the DaVinci changing table, but I've switched to another brand of changing pad (even if the size is not 100% right). This just isn't worth the money."
2,Tears Easily,"The problem with the DaVinci Dresser is that only this pad seems to fit in it. This mat would be great except that the plastic tears very easily. I can't find a changing pad cover that fits it either! I have taken to keeping a roll of clear tape nearby to patch up rips and tears. My son is 18 mos old and we are on our 3rd pad already.If you can find an alternative pad or a cover for this to prevent tears, I suggest you buy it!"
1,It rips & breaks,"My son just turned 1 year old and I have purchased 4 of this silly, bad quality pad so far!This not a fabric material. Is only plastic and is super cheap and rips all the time. Worst is for DaVinci changing table nothing else is fit ( if someone knows any other brand pls, tell me ). So I bought $180 changing table and so far have paid around $80 for the pad and guess what my son is only 1 yr old!Please do yourself a favor and do not buy this garbage!"
3,Changing pad,"While I do my diaper changes on the floor, I prefer using a full size flat changing pad. The plastic cover on this one is thin and started coming apart within a couple weeks. This might work better with the DaVinci Changer, or with some sort of fabric cover. But I will need to replace mine with something else. I have also purchasedSummer Infant Changing Table Pad - 32"" X 16"" X 1""and that was a more durable flat changing pad."
3,Little Bag ...,I Ordered this Bag as a Tote for traveling or go to the Gym and i was dissapointed is little!!!! it is good quality and the leather feel nice and dont smell but the size is not what i was looking for my wife said looks like a Doctors bag... not good when u want to look cool ... but im keepin the bag cause is cheap and i guess i can use it later or get use to use it once it get a little old ... i wont size the bag cause im lazy ... but if u go to the gym and carry one of those regular bags tote bag i mean ... and then you seen one of the same style but little well thats the size of this bag ... not bad if u looking to carry less stuff
4,Nice product,"It's very good, I like it except the belt part.It's too small. That's why I rate it 4, not 5. But still the bag is very good."
1,STOP! This is not solid leather as shown but patchleather!,"I like this bag. It is a good overnight size with plenty of pockets. The smell issue does not exist, at least with this bag. BUT...this item is misrepresented. If you take the picture and blow it up the bag shown ""is not"" a patch leather bag. In the description is says ""leather"", not ""patch leather"". I ordered it because it was described and pictured as regular leather. Patch leather bags are cheaper and don't look as good as non-patch bags. Soooooo!, to me this bag has been misrepresented and I think this is perhaps one of the highest offenses a vendor can make. To make it worse, there is no vendor to contact because it comes directly from amazon. You either keep it or you return it. I haven't decided which course to take. Because of what I see as a misrepresentation of the material the bag is made from I am giving this item one star!"
2,Beautiful but deadly,"This bag arrived in a timely fashion and looks great.When I opened the package there was a very strong odor. It smelled like rotting potato peals. It smelled up my entire one bedroom apartment. I tried sprays, cleaners, and airing out the bag. Nothing worked. I even tried packing the bag for a couple of days in a plastic bag in which I poured a whole box of baking powder. This helped a little but even now, weeks later, the bag still has an odor.The price was good, but it doesn't seem like such a good deal now."
4,Maxam #18 Leather Tote,The bag was the perfect size and very reasonable for a patchwork leather duffle. I would recommend the bag to anyone looking for a size perfect for an overnight or weekend trip.
5,Great buy for the money,Bag met all expectations. Many compartments which allow me to separate certain articles. Makes a great overnight bag for traveling.
5,A very nice gym/travel bag!,"The bag I received arrived quickly, well packaged and without damage. Mine had no ""odor"" problem as reported in other reviews, just a faint, pleasant smell of leather. As expected, the bag was ""made in China"". However, it also appears to be surprisingly well-made, with soft, rich looking, jet-black leather and easy opening and closing zippers. Be advised for use purposes that the main compartment is somewhat small with interior dimenisons of 13"" X 7.5"". The end pockets are a good 2"" X 8"" and tall enough to zip completely over an eight inch hair spray/deodorant can. The front pocket easily expands out several inches. Assuming the stitching holds up (and there is a lot of it), it appears to be a very good buy for the money."
3,Decent Grooming Kit,"My favorite things in this kit are the comb and the nail clippers. My daughter actually sits contently while we use them to cut her fingernails. They are very sharp and the perfect size, and the bulb shape fits comfortably in our hands and helps us to stabilize the clippers. I use the comb every day to smooth out her bedhead, and she really enjoys getting her hair combed. She even tries to use it on herself. The bristle brush is worthless on fine baby hair though. It just glides over the top of her hair, so I never use it. And I've never used the toothbrush because it looks too big. I just use the nubby rubber brushes that slide over my finger. I've used the scissors a couple of times to trim my daughter's bangs, and I feel they are a little dull. But all in all, I am very glad we have this kit."
2,"Good clippers, rest not used","I use the clippers every other day - they work great although I need to lean them inwards in order to stay away from snipping the skin. I have a seven month old, and have never needed the other items. I would have been just fine with one pair of clippers and not the rest of the kit."
4,Long term satifaction,I recieved this as a gift. The few items within the kit are very useful. My daughter wasn't able to use the brush because it was to soft for her thick curly hair. but the comb works wonders in both our hair. The tooth brush is being used as a teething tool as well as cleaning her gums and tounge. The nail clippers has a great grip. Other nail clippers I have tried to use do not work as well as this one. The nail files are better used on the toe nails rather than the finger nails. They are to rough for finger nail. The scissors are being used for my sewing kit. I needed a new one...smiles...The medicine dropper is used daily. My daughter needs to take several oral meds for a reflux problem. It's has been very useful.
2,Broke as soon as I took it out of the package,We registered for this for our shower and we received it. I was really upset with it when the first time I opened it the zipper part broke. I was just simply looking at all the stuff in it and I was done looking at it and went to zip it up and the zipper broke. I don't know if I had a defected one or what but I was so excited about it and was let down. I am going to contact the company as I didn't have a receipt for it to take it back. So watch out for the zipper part!!!!!!!
4,Really compact and nice,"I love the nail clippers and emery boards, and the hair brush, as my son had a lot of hair when he was born! The only problem I've had is the zipper kept breaking and now I finally have given up on it. Otherwise, all of the items (except the toothbrush, which I haven't had to use yet) have been excellent, and it's nice to have it all in one case."
1,Returned before the baby even arrived...,"We opened this item and went to zipper the ""convenient"" carrying case and it wouldn't zip. It was already broken.Aside from that, there are a lot of items used to deal with fingernails. Are three options truly necessary?I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Beware of the scissors,"It may be tempting to try to trim your little person's hair with the ""Safety"" scissors from this kit but be extra careful. My son's ear got caught between the handles (not the blades) and it cut his ear badly enough that it bled for quite a while. Otherwise it is a fine kit."
5,love the scissors!,"I was terrified to cut my newborn's nails, but the scissors in this set are wonderful. My son is 8 months old now, and I've never cut his fingers with these scissors, he actually enjoys the process! I also like the hairbrush. We haven't used nail files (and probably won't), or any of the toothbrushing stuff yet."
2,Compact but cheaply made,"The carry case is cute, but the products are definitely nothing great. The brush is SO HARD. I can't imagine using it on a babies head! The other products are OK, but most people get a lot of them anyway."
2,"Good Idea, but Very Poor Quality","I had to return this kit because the quality was so poor-I definitely got what I paid for. Instead of buying a kit, purchasing individual pieces and a little makeup bag to hold them in makes more sense... it costs a little more, but I then get quality items and I don't have to pay for items that I won't use."
4,Great gift at a great price!,"I love this set! Easy to use carrying case...helps a forgetful, sleep deprived mom to keep track of things.Here are the things I liked:The priceThe carrying caseThe shape of the clippers (easy to hold when you have a squirmy baby!)Nice brush and comb...rubber grip so when your hands are wet from the bath you don't lose the brush.Here are things that I wasn't crazy about:Emery boards just didn't get the job done. My pediatrician said to use regular boards, which worked much better.Not sure what the small brush is....Could use a nasal aspirator with kit...(you'll get one at the hospital, but its great to have an extra one or two!)"
3,"Buy The ""Generic"" Brand","First of all, I think having the toothbrush as a part of this set is very unsanitary. By the time your baby is old enough to use it, the toothbrush will probably be full of bacteria and germs considering you've kept it in there along with the brush and comb that you use on a daily basis. If you insist on purchasing this set, buy the generic brand ""Especially For Baby."" It is cheaper and the colors are nicer. You might also want to reconsider if you are planning to buy the other matching set - Hospital's Choice Deluxe Care Kit. It already contains a nail clipper and scissors - do you really need 2 of those?"
4,"Great package, but not necessary....","I really liked that all these things were packed up together in a nice zipper bag. But I find that by 4 months, I have only used the fingernail clippers and the brush (until all baby's hair fell out!).I hope that it will become more useful as she gets older. If you are buying it solely for the first few months, just get clippers and a brush instead of buying the whole shebang.This would be a good gift item."
2,only used the clippers,"I thought I would get alot of use out of this handy little kit, but I've only used the clippers! I would purchase these things seperate when or if needed."
4,Great gift idea!,"It's a very nice, handy and cheap product. You keep everything in one place. We basically use the nail care products but I think every parent would be happy having this set.I'm sure you'll find it helpful."
3,a compact grooming kit,"i think its a good investment as all my baby,s grooming items are kept neatly in a compact kit otherwise it might be a hard job for me to keep all these tiny things organized where u have a lot more things with a baby to do.my baby is still too young for the tooth brush but i have used all the rest of the things.the price is good too but what actually impressed me was the case.i thought it would fit neatly into the daiper bag.but i don,t usually need it in a daiper bag when going out on short trips."
4,good little kit,"This kit was given to me when my son was born. He is now 2 yrs old and we are still using the comb and nail clippers. Everything in here worked as advertised, I never had any problems with anything. I would have liked to have a thermometer included, that would be my only drawback. I am expecting soon and will use everything in the same kit, except the toothbrush of course! I would recomend it."
3,"OK, but there are better kits out there","I got this as a gift, and it's great for the diaper bag. The problem I have is the brush is falling apart. It's nice having everything in one kit, but I haven't been pleased with the quaility of this one. I also got a similar kit made by the 1st Years. I recommend that one."
4,gift,"We gave this as a gift to friend of ours having a new baby. They had put it on their registry, and have told us they are very happy with the tools in the kit, and find the implements to be safe and effective for grooming their little one."
4,Good set,I love this set and it's a great price! My only problem is that I bought it for my 2 year old daughter who has long hair and the comb isn't strong enough for long thick hair. So I ended up getting her a new comb and giving this one to my baby.
1,Waste of Time,"Another piece of software that's long on promises but short on performance. Tried a variety of packages to try to recover files from a hard disk crash. Search and Recover 2 is just for deleted files, not lost or overwritten files. There are plenty of shareware programs to find files you flushed from your recycle bin. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Defective design,"I encountered 2 problems installing the kit. The first is that the 3/4"" Hose Swivel Connector leaks between the threaded connector and the compression adapter. The second is that the 3/4"" Hose to Pipe Thread Anti-Siphon Connector does not properly compress the water hose's threaded connector to the hose adapter. This causes a leak between the hose connector and adapter. I have the highest quality hose, and it does not leak when connected to an ordinary faucet. The kit is unusable."
4,in my opinion,"I really just wanted to get the song Meant to Be"" but they do a country version of the old Kinks"" hit ""You Really Got Me"" that is excellent and the whole CD is very good."
1,WARNING: SAVE YOURSELF TEN BUCKS !,"Well, somebody has got to be the first to review it, so here goes.Of all the country albums I've heard, this is definitely the worst ever! I bought it just for ""A cowboy's born with a broken heart"", expecting the rest to be in the same vein (at least the titles looked promissing). I don't know how the other albums by this band sound, but this is pathetic. You can hardly call this country music by any standard. The first couple of tracks sound more like ""praise songs"", the harmonies are almost gospel-like. The only tracks bearable are ""In another tear from now"", ""If her heart ain't in Memphis"" and the forementioned ""A cowboy's born ..."". Only the latter is really good, the other two being ruined somewhere down the line. ABSOLUTE LOW HOWEVER IS THE KINKS-COVER ""YOU REALLY GOT ME"".Verdict: one star for ""A cowboy's born ..."" and the effort. They should thank me for that one star."
5,Ozzy Unleashed !,"This is a truly amazing dvd with concert footages aplenty ranging from his days in Black Sabbath all the way to his kick-ass solo career. You can notice the ""bass"" change in the dvd when he removes himself from the Black Sabbath era as there is a lack of heavy bass in most of their songs. Turn it up real loud , and as the dvd shifts to the solo career "" I don't want to change the world "" just shifts into overdrive with amazing frantic concert footages guaranteed to put some goosebumps on you , forcing you to chant "" Ozzy ! Ozzy ! ""It basically starts off with Ozzy giving his views on his Black Sabbath days , and others sharing their thoughts.

2,Ozzy Osbourn - Don't Blame Me,"I purchased this item as a gift for a friend of mine. I ordered the New copy as opposed to a used copy in hopes that it wouldn't be defective. The copy I received had scratches on it and skipped. I have been unable to get an addresss, email address or phone number for the company that Amazon went through. It has been very frustrating. I will not purchase items of this nature through Amazon again. I will go through Movies Unlimited where I know their products are good, and they are trustworthy."
1,Historic Fiction,"John Schroeder, has concocted a fanciful story based on shoddy research and very weak arguments that have long ago been refuted by real history. The author's only credential seems to be his status as an ""ex-Catholic"" with a very big ax to grind. This may explain why Mr. Schroeder omits so much information. Thankfully we are able to read what the Church Fathers actually wrote and as is always the case the truth offers a much better picture. For those who believe in make-believe rather than factual truth Mr. Schroeder has written a masterpiece."
1,Drip Drip Drip Drip......,We loved the idea of the 4 in 1 bath station until we discovered that it leaks. So when washing our 2 month old son we have to be quick about things and have a towel under it the tub.. The tub quickly runs out of water and you have a huge mess afterward. My advice is to look at something different or use this in the tub....
5,"Worth the ""extra"" effort!","I wish that I would have had a tub like this when we had our twins 5 years ago! When we bought it for our new little one, I have to say I was a little leary about a tub that ""folds up""!! No worries now, though! It has only leaked on my counter one time and that was my own fault -- I didn't check it before putting the water in it and I should have! I found that it was EXTREMELY easy to assemble, etc. Also, the cover for the sling is completely removable and machine washable as well. I plan on purchasing this item for a couple friends who are expecting little ones as well -- I'll even show them how to set it up if necessary!! :-)"
1,WORST TUB EVER,This tub sucks. It leaks and its uncomfortable for the baby. There is a bump that digs into baby's butt. Very hard to keep baby stable on it. I had to buy another tub. This tub is a waste of money.
1,SLING IS GOOD BUT TUB LEAKS!!!,"I GOT THE 4 IN 1 BATH STATION FOR MY BABY SHOWER AND EVERYTIME I USED IT , THE WATER WOULD POUR OUT ALL OVER . I TRIED IT ON MY COUNTER ON MY KITCHEN TABLE AND MY BATHROOM FLOOR. IT SOAKED EVERYTHING EVERYTIME I USED IT I EVEN TRIED PUTTING A BIG BATH TOWEL UNDER IT AND THE WATER SATURATED THE TOWEL AS WELL.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BATH TUB TO ANYONE. I ALSO CALLED THE MANUFACTURER AND THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD ALOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS TUB AND YET THE STORES STILL SELL THEM ON THE SHELVES. IF YOU DO USE IT PUT IT IN YOUR BATHTUB WHEN USING BUT YOU MAY END UP REFILLING IT WITH WATER BEFORE YOUR CHILDS BATHTIME IS OVER."
4,Don't let those bad reviews scare you!,I absolutly loved this bathtub!!! It was a little hard to get the tub to lock for me but my husband did it in about 5 seconds! I have three kids and three different tubs for each and this is by far the best yet! It is very hard to bathe a newborn but with this tub it is soooo much easier! I highly recomend this tub!
1,Leaky Boat,"This bath is really frustrating because it leaks consistently.When I say ""leaks"", I don't mean drip drip. I mean it pours out!I've tried to adjust it's size and prevent leaking by closely following the directions, but to no avail.I should have known that the concept of an adjustable bathtub holding water was unrealistic.I'm forced to now purchase a simpler, one-piece tub.Avoid this tub at all costs!"
2,Sling doesn't stay in place!,"This is probably my least favorite item from my baby registry. I got this tub before my now 3 1/2 month old son was born. We used the sling alone when he was a newborn and it worked fine. Now that he's older, but not sitting up, we're using the sling in the tub part (Stage 2). The sling is supposed to snap in place, but it doesn't, and I wind up trying to slide the baby back in place with one hand while adjusting the sling with the other, all the while, hanging over the side of the big tub. It's great for backaches! Maybe it will be fine once our son is sitting up on his own, but until then, I'm getting frustrated with bathtime!"
1,The WORST,"I hate this tub. Flat out- I hate it!!! My daughter loved to kick and splash in bath time and she constantly kicked the blue bar, which had to hurt! It isn't very deep, so she froze. Ours leaked slowly, so Daddy invented ""speed bathing."" Not very much fun. By the time she was done, there was barely any water left. And once she was about 3 months old (and she was not a big baby!) we had to retire it because it was simply not a comfortable fit.We bought the Primo Eurobath, which was so much better. The sling on this bath tub was nice, that is the only star it gets. Other than that, forget it, it isn't worth it!"
1,buy another tub,"I did not like this tub at all because it would always leak through the middle and the suction cups did not work well. Also, the sling does not stay in place and the baby keeps slipping all over the place."
1,It leaks!,"No matter how hard I push to snap the two parts of this tub together, it still leaks. I think I am going to buy the Eurobath instead."
1,Waste of Money,"I had originally liked the idea of having a bath tub that could convert to change with my daughters growing needs. I also like the fact that it was adjustable for easy storage. The water leaked out the first time I tried to use it. You need to push down on the middle to ""snap it into place"". It was very hard to snap into place. It has suction cups on the bottom to hold it in place. After pushing down on the middle I could barely get it back out of my tub!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"Unless you want a big bulky tub that leaks all over, don't buy this tub! I thought it would be great when I received it at my baby shower. However, it makes me wish I was still giving my son sponge baths. No matter what you do, this tub is going to leak somehow, and once you get it snapped into place, it's extremely hard to get it to convert back to the smaller size so that it can be stored. I have absolutely nowhere for this tub to go. It's constantly being moved from the shower to the sink because I don't have a shelf big enough to store the stupid thing. I'm actually on the way out the door to buy one of the smaller, cheaper, one-piece tubs at Wal-Mart right now."
2,not very useful,"We had this on the registry, recommended by a family member. Turns out she gave us the wrong brand name, and I regret taking back the other tub we also got as a gift.-We never use the collapsible feature, and it leaks a lot on the seam.-The fabric seat for the tub doesn't really seem to fit in the tub; no matter how I try to place it, it's like it was made for a different tub.-It doesn't really fit over our kitchen sink, and you can't leave it on the counter since it leaks. That leaves placing it in the bath, which is a back-breaking exercise.-The suction cups make it impossible to move when it's full, which I suppose is a good thing for stability but makes it impossible to empty when the bath is done.All in all, I'm sure there must be a better solution out there."
4,Great bath tub,"Overall, I really liked this tub. The first time we used it, it leaked all over the floor, but then we realized that the bottom wasn't latched completely. As soon as we locked it into place it worked great! Love the sling for my newborn, and the length is great since she is a long baby!"
1,buy another tub,"I would advise choosing another tub. There are so many crevices which are difficult to clean and they attract mildew like crazy. I just started having my 6-month old sit-up in the tub, and while the bar keeps him nice and steady, it makes it very difficult to actually get at his body parts to clean him - and he is a tiny little guy. The tub is supposed to be easy to make more compact for storage, but it is a pain to slide in and out, so I've yet to actually use this feature. Lastly, the suction cups on the bottom make it a pain in the neck to move - impossible to move, in fact, when filled with water and child. Buy a simple, cheap tub - the ""features"" of this tub are just a hassle!"
1,Got Mildew,"I got mildew in the crevace of this tub where it expands. I always washed it afterwards, but ended up throwing it out and buying the one piece cheaper one."
2,Not so great,"I too have a problem with the sling...actually, I have 2 problems. The sling won't stay in place....it snaps in before we start the bath but starts sliding around. My second problem is that the sling is slippery. My son just slides down. One time he slid so quickly that his back hit the grooves that the toddler ring snap into and it left a bruise on his back! I have to place a washcloth over the area to keep him from getting bruised again. I still use this tub because I refuse to spend any more money on an item that is only used for a few months but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."
1,It leaks!,I bought the bathtub and the first time we used it it leaked water everywhere. By the time you realize what is happening you have a cold naked baby in your arms and water at your feet. My friend said that she loved her bathhtub so I exchanged mine figuring that it was a fluke. Well... it happened again. I gave up the bathtub all together and purchsed another brand. What sold me on this tub was the fact that it grew with your child so you wouldn't need to buy another one when your baby became a toddler. Not worth the mess and chaos!
2,not easy to use,"I thought this would be a great item to buy for my second baby. However, it's too much trouble with the adjustments, it doesn't have a smooth bottom surface, and there isn't enough room (even for my 3 week old!).I would buy a regular, plain baby bathtub and an infant support."
2,Don't really recommend it,"The bath station was incredibly hard to lock in. I had to actually stand the bath station on the floor, push my foot down on one end and pull up on the other. After struggling with the lock, it leaked. Not a flood but there was a good sized puddle on my kitchen counter. I tend to keep my bath time around 5 minutes because of this. As for the sling, it's not the greatest thing either. My daughter keeps sliding down it. Besides, after being wet for a few minutes it gets pretty cold and my daughter starts screaming. I don't necessarily hate this tub, but I really wouldn't recommend it."
1,Leaks!!! Beware!,"Looked like Niagra falls in my bathroom. I read the directions, but there is no way to avoid the suction breaking when you need to lift the tub after filling it with water. I went out and bought another tub the next day. Beware when purchasing product!"
3,"Not bad, not great, just so-so","I got this and returned it. Not because it was horrible, just because my daughter is already 5 months old and too big for the sling and too small for the seat. I ended getting the Eurobath instead. The sling was slippery for her and I couldn't get it right. The suction cups definitely do the job! ...that's great if you don't want it to move, but in the tub it makes it more difficult for me to fill, empty, etc. So, that turned out to be a negative for me. Yeah, you can pry it up, but it's frustrating. No leaking though!! I tested it a few times and it was leak-proof for me. So if you're only worried about that, then this is a good tub for you."
1,This Tub is awful,"This tub leaks like crazy. Too bad I did not save the reciept I would return it if I did. Even though I snapped the middle piece together I was very disappointed to find it still LEAKED. What a waste of money. The suction cups work almost too good, it's hard to get the darn thing out of the tub with those suction cups. I would fill the tub and then put my 4 month old in it, within 3 minutes majority of the water was gone. I hate this tub. Don't buy it unless you believe in taking 1 minute baths. That is the maximum time all the water will stay in this tub."
2,It's not a very good product,I think this product is too complicated to use. There are too many not so useful features. I had to return it after trying to use it.
1,Don't waste your money!,"We registered for this tub and were so excited at the prospect of using it for all her bathing ""stages."" No such luck. THIS TUB LEAKS LIKE CRAZY! The clips don't hold. One of the store clerks told me that it was because I wasn't clipping it on the bottom. My husband and my father (an engineer!) couldn't master this apparently ""easy"" clipping technique and the water always ran out - very frustrating!"
1,Leaks too much,"We thought this tub was great but, after owning it three months, it leaks terribly. Now we can only use it by placing it in the bathtub. This is not what we wanted."
1,This bathtub leaks!,"I was not very happy with the 4 in one bath station, because it leaks. It is made in a way where the water comes out from the bottom, since this tub is interchangeable to eventually be used for a toddler. It is not sealed properly. I donot recommend this item."
1,Don't bother,"I registered for this bath and you cannot get the thing to stay together unless your the Hulk, I am taking it back to the store."
1,looks too good to be true...,"I read all the other people having trouble with the leaking...we didn't even GET that far!!! It took both my husband and I pulling on the ends of the tub to try to get it open enough to lock it open, and couldn't even get it to lock!!! and when it's open, you can't fit it in the sink...the sling? great, but you can just buy it separate...I couldn't even use this once...returned and got the fold away tub, which is really inexpensive, fits in the sink, doesn't get moldy, and when it dries, I can just put in in a corner and it's hidden, it gets that small....DO NOT BUY THIS TUB, IT'S HORRIBLE!!!"
2,Not worth the money...,"I got this tub at one of my showers....it leakes like crazy! I have not been satisfied with this tuba at all. When I registered for it I saw nothing but good reviews, but it is not worth the money. The sling does not help at all! I get the bath ready for my 6 month old son and then go and undress him...by the time i get back in the bath room all the water is almost gone! I have had to refill the tub at least three times now. I wish i had registered for a different tub."
2,Not worth the hassle,"I bought this product because of the 4-in 1 purpose, but only got 2-in-1 out of it! The first time my husband and I used the tub, it leaked all over the kitchen floor. We finally figured out how to lock it properly, but after locking the bathtub it is very hard to unlock and to store. At this point it is setup in its tub form.As far as cleaning this bathtub, I have to fight with the locks every time. This tub also comes with a sling for your baby to lay on, it's too bad it does not stay in place! All in all I would not recommend this product to another parent."
1,1 and 1 to go,"This tub is not the product to buy. I received this as a gift for my shower and used it for my first child (now too big for it). It leaked every time we used it, and I mean REALLY leaked. We eventually had to use it in the large tub to keep from mopping the floor every night. The sling does not stay in place, and we found it very frustrating to use this product. Baby #2 is now on the way and we are definitely going to be buying a new tub. The old one is now a planter in the backyard..."
2,"OK Tub, Nothing Special","I thought the convertible tub idea was great, but I found it difficult to use and not very special. After leaking water all over my coutertops, I finally discovered the hiding suction cup that holds water in and bathed my twin girls for the first time. Neither baby fit very comfortably in the tub and both needed extra support. I deinately wished that I had tried out another tub."
1,We're taking it back,This tub is awful. The two times we attempted to use it it leaked terribly. We boxed it back up and plan to take it back.
4,"Great tub, stilling using it at 17 months","We've used this tub since we brought our daughter home from the hospital, and it's great. She's now 17 months old, and we still use it every night. Ours does not leak, but we set it up in the big bathtub anyway, so if it did leak the water would just go down the drain."
2,Not the best bath station,I would probably not recommend this product. I had the same issue with the leaking but my husband somehow corrected it. I agree with the mold...I turn my over to drip dry and it gets in the cracks really bad. My daughter on the other hand loves sitting in it splashing around when it comes to bath time. Not very easy to fill up in the bath tub also. I have to turn on our shower in order to fill it up. I am sure there are better ones out there.
2,Not designed for bigger babies,"The sling in the tub does not work well if you have a large baby. My son is only 4 months old (not sitting up yet) but is 28"" long. His feet hit the end of the tub and have for the last month. He kicks and pushes aginst the end and managed to break a toenail last week."
3,good tub...bad sling,I guess I'm one of the lucky ones whose bathtub didn't leak but my problem is with the sling. She's 4 months old...not quite ready to sit up on her own but trys. Where the sling bends its starting to rip on both bends and as a few of the other commenters said and I agree she keeps sliding down. I like the depth of this tub. It allows her to kick inbetween the times I'm not pulling her back up onto the sling.
1,leaks,i thought i was the only one that found this tub to leak like crazy but i see it leaks for everyone.
2,Seemed like a great tub....,"My husband and I thought that this tub looked great in the store, so we bought it thinking that we were going to be pleased, and our son would be able to use it for awhile. When we got home, I checked the reviews on it, and got a little discouraged, but we decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. It was great for about the 1st 1 1/2 months. It then started to leak, and I NEVER unlocked it making it smaller, we just kept it fully locked all the time. I would run the water for my sons bath, and by the time I was ready to put him in it, half the water was gone. Also I noticed that the infant bath sling was rusting where it connected to the tub. I immediatly retured it to the store, and got a different one."
1,The Sling DOES Snap Into Place,"You have to put one side of the sling into the groove and then push fairly hard toward the other side to get the sling into the right position. The instructions that come with the tub are faily misleading as to how to ""lock"" the sling into place. But it does lock in very well and secure you just have to go at it one side into the groove at a time. That is about the only positive remark I can make about this tub though. My baby was very uncomfortable in it and we bought another."
1,Leaky and Hazardess,"I loved this tub in the beginning, when my son was a newborn and didn't move much. But, around 3 1/2 months old, he started to play in the tub, and the sling just moves back away from the tub, causing him to slide down. Then when he could reach the other side of the tub, he would push himself, and because the sling doesn't lock in, it would just almost fly out of the tub. Then the tub just started leaking. We checked that it was assembled right, and it was. I suggest a one peice tub, this one looks great on the box, but is terrible in the tub."
1,An uncomfortable tub,"I first used this tub when my preemie son was just 2 months old. First off, the sling does not snap in place and the head rest is still very hard. Secondly, the sides of the sling are not even padded which may hurt his flailing extremities. He is now 4 months old, and have tried to use it time and again to see if I could eventually like it, and I still don't. I will try again when he's old enough to sit up on his own and see if he likes it."
2,LEAKS! BUT THE RAMP IS NICE.,"Leaky, leaky tub. The only way my husband and I could use it is by placing this tub in our own tub which is very uncomfortable as we have to bend down during the whole bath time. Put it on the counter and it will leak all over your bathroom floor.But now that our baby is older(since he was about 10 months old), he loves to play while sitting in it with the ramp in place. It is also easier to wash him now that he does not slip and slide all over the place. Without the ramp, this bath tub is worthless."
1,Mothers be careful this product is not all it says.,This product is hard to setup and most importantly it leaks. I have to use this in my tub and keep adding more water to the baby bath. I chose this tub because it sounds good and as a first time mother thought it would be helpful since I was not confident about bathing a baby. Boy was I wrong. I had to buy another one. The only good thing is the sling it actually keeps the baby up while you are giving it a bath. However I would not recommend this bath to anyone.
2,go with a cheaper tub,"I bought this tub because it cost a little more than the other ones, and seemed to have more features. I have learned that the more expensive option is not necessarily the better one. My main complaint is the tub ring. When I put my six-month son in it he slid right down, and I felt like it offered no added security compared to just setting him in a bath tub. Overall, I just think it's a poorly thought-out and crafted product."
1,Keep the receipt,"If you are getting ready to register for this tub I hope you get a gift receipt. Why should a bathtub FOLD? There is really no reason. No wonder it leaks. We couldn't figure out the infant sling for this either. We ended up returning the tub and going with a cheaper, simpler design that works better. When we opened the box we noticed someone had left a baby shower card in the box. We weren't the only people to return it!!"
1,"Leak, Leak, Leak",The sling would not hold my infant securely so I borrowed a tub for him to use the first six months. We did have a leaking incident the first time we used it but I thought it was from misuse. I have given my son a bath in the tub about 6 times since he could sit up. Every time it leaks and I end up with a cold unhappy baby who used to love baths! Don't buy this tub. It is a waste of money.
2,Not as expected,I am a new mom and we bought this tub because most of the First Years products are really good. This tub has been a bit disappointing so far. We read all the instructions but like another previous reviewer we are having a hard time getting the sling to snap into place. The tub also tends to leak a lot...we spend many a time cleaning up tons of water up off the table or floor when were trying to use it for our premie after her umbilical cord stump fell off and we wanted to advance from sponge baths. I think First Years could have done a much better job with this tub.
2,Don't waste your money!,"I have to agree with the majority of the reviewers here. The tub leaks! I've read the instructions and followed them and the thing still leaks. I had to resort to putting this bathtub inside our regular bathtub in order to accomodate the leaking. What an inconvenience! Instead of being able to bath baby in the tub on a kitchen counter like we originally tried, I had to hunch over the regular bathtub and into the baby bathtub to wash my baby. Shouldn't the first rule of thumb for whether or not a bathtub is satisfactory, be whether or not it leaks? There have to be better products out there. Don't waste your money on this!"
2,Pass for active babies,"My son (3.5 months) wiggles around so much I'm afraid the sling is going to shoot right out from under him. He pushes his heels into the bottom of the tub and pushes backwards. This tub might be alright for an older baby, but if you have a wild one like mine, then you might want to pass."
1,Very hard to set up,"This tub is very hard to set up and I had to try a few times. The instructions given were lousy, I almost clipped my own fingers in between the moveable part while trying to slide it open fullsize.The base of this tub is also uneven, I'm not sure if it's 'friendly' to newborns as it could scratch the baby's skin. The fabric slide is also flimsy when set up at the edge of the tub, it moves! This slide DOES NOT snap on as claimed, it simply just sits at the edge of the tub.. don't be fooled.Overall, I think if you have to use this tub, it may be better for a toddler since it has the bath ring.For newborns, this tub may not be suitable. I'm stuck with it and I don't even want to give it away as a gift because I don't think it's an ideal product. I am thinking of getting another tub when my new baby arrives.Although the tub itself is 'Made in US', the plastic quality is poor. The slide is 'Made in China' and the quality is acceptable.If you have a choice, don't buy this."
1,I read the intructions,"This tub sucks. I read the instructions and followed them and I still think it sucks. It's too big and heavy to deal with when you also have a baby to deal with at the same time. And don't say ""put the baby down"" - we all know you can't always do that. And to put it together you need two hands and it's still difficult to do. A bath tub just should not be that complicated!!"
4,Great tub!,"This is a great little tub. Although my son outgrew the sling very quickly, the swing around ring was very helpful until he could sit up on his own. Now at 10 months (and 24lbs), he just loves to sit and splash when it's bath time. You do have to fill the main tub around this one (or the water will leak out), but it's well worth it and we will get plenty of mileage out of this tub."
2,Not good for newborns,I thought this tub looked like it would work for my newborn. WRONG.. the support stinks... now that he is sitting up I like it. I would recommend one that would support a baby better for those baths in the begining. It is a new experience for your baby and you want it to be a good one..
4,Very Versitle,"Great product! I originally got this because my baby was always trying to stand in the bath. Used as a bathseat, this is one of probably the safest ones out there.( I couldn't use the one with the parent anchor arm do to shower doors on tub) It suctions down and since it is a tub also, you have much more control over the amount of water you use. Also, the front plastic bar can be moved out of the way to remove baby without bumping their legs.(which was a problem with another bath seat a had) As a toddler tub it has plenty of room for movement. I only gave it four stars because I didn't use it for an infant but it seems to have all you would need and I plan to use it with my next! **It only leaks if it is not snapped down correctly!**"
1,Piece of Junk,"I can not believe they still sell this piece of junk!!! I recieved this almost exact same thing at my shower over 3 years ago!!!! I doesn't hold water at all! I had to fill the entire tub in order to use it as a ""tub seat""on top of that, my son found it to be the most uncomfortable seat ever when he was 7 months old-all he did was cry in it!! Do yourself a favor, don't ever think of buying this-even for your worst enemy, it's that bad."
1,Good Idea - Poor Design,"I was lured into purchasing this item based on the 4 in 1 feature. It was a nightmare to assemble eventhough technically you're supposed to pull until it snaps in place. You basically have to play tug o war in order to get it to lock in place. And once you did get it locked it was another superhuman effort to get the tub to collapse. I likewise had the same problem with leaking. If it is not completely locked, watch out if you're bathing on the counter top like I was. The infant feature was horrible. I couldn't get mine to stay in place and even once it dried it smelled damp. I didn't even get as far as the ring feature I was so disappointed. I took mine back and exchanged it for a one piece tub from the first years brand."
1,Waste of money,Our tub has leaked since the VERY 1st time we used it. And it continues to leak. What is sad is that you can spend a lot less money on a cheaper one and it works better than this one. Very disappointed.
1,Leaks,I'm so glad that I am not stupid. I thought that I was the problem with this leaking nightmare. Problem #1: It is very difficult to resize and problem #2: it leaks. It went all over my kitchen floor and counter. I had to buy a new tub. I feel bad for the person who spent the $$ for my baby shower.
1,I don't recommend this tub,"I registered for this tub because I thought it is very cool and so multi-functional.After the baby was born and passed his stage of dry bath, I found this tub is not very easy to use. My husband and I coudln't solve the leaking issue. It also difficult for me to expand or close the tub.The sling is not very good, either.I tried to use this tub for 3 times and returned it. I got Sure Comfort Deluxe instead. I think Sure Comfort Deluxe is a much better choice for new born. It is very easy to put over my sink. The green net comes with the tub is easy to use."
1,Looking for a new tub,"I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this product. I am not happy with it all and in search of a new tub. The main thing I disliked about this product was the sling. I used it in the sink at first and my baby kept sliding down it. We have a big sink so I had to be aggressive in holding him, fearing I was hurting him. Then we moved the sling into the tub and are having the same problems. I would prefer one that is smaller so he rests tightly in it."
1,worst bath ever!,"NOt only did the baby slide off of the bath sling the whole time, the bath leaked and the tub pad for the head did not accomodate my baby's head- she kept slipping. This bath made bathtime a horrible experience and I am very sorry that i bought it!!!!!"
1,Beware!,I registered for this tub and I hate it! It leaks all over....by the time I finish filling it up half the water is all over the counter...Pretty much everything I have gotten from this company has not worked...I would suggest not buying this item!
1,Mold Collector,"I bought this tub and am not impressed at all. Here are my top 3 complaints:1) Permanant thumb nail damage in putting the &$*$ thing together.2) Despite draining the tub, hanging it upside down and letting it dry, it still stays moist in spots and is a mold trap.3) Suction cups work VERY good and make for a real you know what to get the tub up.Probably the best part is the slanted infant mesh angle seat. That I use by it's self in our big tub. Don't waste your money.And one more thing, if you haven't broken all of your fingernails, this tub will leak until your husband snaps it like Hulk Hogan."
1,It Leaks!!,"This tub leaked every time we used it. We read all of the instructions, and tried this tub for quite a few baths, but no matter what we did, it leaked. We returned it and got the Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn-to-Toddler Tub. It is all one piece, and does not leak at all."
2,leaky and uncomfortable,I baught this tub for my daughter. I was not very happy with this tub the middle where it snaps together leaks every time I use it. And the most aggravating thing about it is the tub is not comfortable even with the use of the sling. Every time I use it the section where you are supposed to snap it together leaves red marks on my 5 month olds bottom and it hurts her. That hard solid plastic sticking up there is not good for a baby's bottom.
2,Not the best thing for older infants!,"I hadn't heard much on this tub when i got it as a gift. My daughter loved laying down in the tub as a younger infant, but when she started sitting up in the tub she hated it. Her legs were scratched by the support rest. There is not enough room where she is sitting and too much room in front of her. I recommend this purchase for younger infants. I have found that it leaks too."
2,Not Super Sturdy,"Ours cracked in one spot. Also, the sling is not attached or secured at the bottom so it is wobbly when you put the baby on it... We didn't love it with our daughter and when our son was born bought another one from Target that we really love. It's great and has a sling that is attached at both ends. It is much more secure - I didn't see it online or I would suggest it."
1,"Mildew smelling, hard to snap together, bad bath!","I HATE this tub. The ""push down"" in the center to prevent leaking was not simple. I got so frustrated I put my foot on it and jumped on it. Finally I heard a snap and thought I broke it. No, it just finally snapped together to prevent the leaking. The sling is alright, it doesn't dry out correctly and smells like mildew so I washed it all the time, but who has time to keep putting it back together!? The suction cups are a pain to me because I use the same bathroom to shower in.I wish I would have just gotten the sling then the next tub that I got was great - a blow up tub - looks like a mini pool. I LOVE it and wish I used it earlier than 6 months. I had to buy another after a few months, but only because I don't like to clean and it would get a little slimy over time. He's still prefers it at 15 months!"
2,Not very happy with this one....,"I recieved this item as a shower gift and am not pleased with it. There is no skid mat on the bottom...our son's bottom kept slipping on the bottom of the tub. Second, the snap lock on the bottom inside the tub kept leaving marks on his bare [...]. The cross bar is not a good thing especially if you have a little boy. We have an inflatable duck tub I also recieved as a shower gift and he absolutely loves it!"
1,Tub leaks,I had read the reviews about this tub leaking but decided to try it for myself because I liked to size of it. At first it was okay. I kept it it the same position (never collapsed it for storage) and then about a week later it just started to leak. Also the sling dose not stay in place safely- I bought another on from The First Years that I love and am still using with my 8 months old
2,Not for me,"I received this as a shower gift and thought it was fabulous until I actually began to use it. For the first couple of months I used the sling however, when my son began to get active, he would kick at the water so much that the sling wouldn't stay clipped in. Once he was able to sit, I began to use the ring. I discontinued use of it soon after because the ring actually cut his stomach when he leaned over the ring to grab his rubber ducky. He is very chunky. A 20 lb, breastfed, 5 month old. So I think that his stomach got pinched between his legs and the ring, and when he turned his body, it gave him a scratch. I realized then that the underneath of the plastic ring is very rough and seems a bit sharp as well. It also leaked the entire time, but wasn't too big a deal for me being that I used it in the tub anyway. And I WAS locking it during each use. Now that he is able to hold his head up, I just use my bath tub. He seems to enjoy it more anyway."
1,Worst purchase!,"I registered for this tub for my baby shower due to a recommendation from a friend. This is probably the worst baby product that I have purchased yet! The reclining back attachment for the infant does not secure properly, I could never use it. I waited until my daughter was older and bought a cheapy tub for infants to use in the meantime. I tried the tub again now that she can sit up. It will not lock in position, and it leaks! I am so frustrated with this tub! I am going to buy a different tub AGAIN! Do not buy this piece of junk! I've spent twice the amount of it's value in replacements! AAAHHH!"
4,"Very good product, unnecessarily bashed!","A few words about these reviews:Don't let those ""aweful product"" or ""terrible"" reviews deter you. This is a great product--period. If you assemble it properly and if you take the time to read and follow the instructions, this bath tub will make itself worth.I've had similar experiences as of late where the reviews are dismal, yet once me and my wife get and use the product we are nothing but satisfied. Same happen with the crib, the stroller, etc. People will always complain for the pettiest things. If it's not because the instructions are too long, then it's because it spills if you jerk it--very easy to blame the product when it's obviously a matter of user error.About The Product:This is a very versatile bath tub. With its four configurations it will easily last a couple of years. If used properly and locked properly it WILL NOT leak. With the supplied attachments makes bathing a breeze and secure. For the price I think it's a very good value."
1,horrible tub,"I registered for this item w/o reading the reviews first. I sure wish I had. This tub is horrible. The mesh sling, which is supposed to help keep the baby in place, does nothing of the sort. My son just kept sliding down it, so I had to constantly keep picking him up and repositioning him. It is very large and bulky, hard to store. It is prone to getting mold in the areas where it is supposed to slide to get smaller for storing. The edges are not smooth and scratched my son more than once. Please take my advice and pick a different infant tub. I ended up throwing this one away and buying a less expensive one, which I am much happier with!!!"
1,THIS IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE,"This has been by far the worst baby item my husband and I managed to purchase. Not only is this the most bulky tub on the market but the thing leaks everywhere. If you have a infant that likes to kind of swish his/her feet in the water a little bit, or heaven forbid they sneeze FORGET IT. You will be mopping the floor more than you will be changing diapers. Effective for a lifeless sack of potatoes MAYBE, a good investment for an infant tub NOT LIKELY. I took that tub back to the store and demanded my money back even though it was used. I ended up buying a cheap store brand tub with a sling for my infant and it worked great. I would never recommend this thing to anyone."
1,What was I thinking,I really wish I could get my money back on this thing! It is not user friendly at all. The sling does not fit properly into the section where it's supposed to go. The part in the bottom where it is connected scrapes my babys' bottom. I just had a c-section and have to put the tub on the counter. No matter what I do to make sure the stopper is sealed and the bottom is pushed down it leaks water all over the place. This product is too over priced. I would not recommend it to anybody. I'm buying a new this week.
1,I wouldn't buy this if I were you,"This tub does not really take you through four stages. I received it as a shower gift, and started using it right away. The sling by itself was OK for stage one, but it doesn't fit comfortably or safely in the tub. Once you have the tub open, it leaks!!! Just don't waste your money; look elsewhere."
3,Leaky tub,"I like this tub except for the fact that it leaks. Because it extends and snaps locked, I find that halfway through my son's bath, half the water is gone. THis was terribly frustrating when we were bathing him on the kitchen table right after we brought him home from the hospital. I like that it grows with the baby, and that the fabric on the sling can be easily removed for washing. I also like that there are suction cups on the bottom. I don't know that I would buy this particular tub again."
4,Wonderful tub!!,"I am now using this tub with my second son. I love it! It is very convenient and easy to use. As long as you make sure that it is completely locked in place, it won't leak. We used this with my oldest son until he couldn't fit anymore, and are using it with my newborn now. The only problem that we had was that the fabric on the bath sling started to tear after two years. It has been replaced and we are good to go again. I highly recommend this tub."
1,"Major waste, major leaks, major pain!",It does not take a rocket scientist to put this together but it does take lots of muscles. After fighting with this thing for a half an hour I finally got it put together. It leaked then and it leaks every time I put it together. It does loosen up so it is easier to put together but by then it just leaks more! When my son was old enough to use the ring I put him in it. His butt kept sliding and he would rack his private parts on the crotch bar. I had to dump that and buy something that really worked!
1,Problem tub,"Not only did the bathtub leak, the sling was not appropriate for tiny babies. The thin material didn't adequately pad the metal support, so the baby's tailbone was resting on a solid metal bar! Even if the tub had not leaked, I would not have used it until the baby could sit up. Not a good tub for small babies."
1,leaky tub,"I hated this bath. I read the directions and could not get the tub to snap correctly. We ended up using this bath in our big tub so that when it leaked, it would just drain down the tub. The bath did not leak all the time, just when I had it on the counter or if I moved it. Do not recommend!"
2,"Leaks, Leaks, Leaks!!","I loved this tub when I first got it. I used a sponge in it when my daughter was first born, and then as she got about two months old, I used the net insert. I loved them both, until it started leaking. No matter what I do, it leaks. Now that I have gotten into the habbit of mopping the floor nightly, I have a clean child and a clean kitchen floor, but I am exhausted after every bath. I am on here now in search of another tub. I will definitly not get a tub that is not a one piece tub from here on out."
2,Not as Good as it Looks,"I registered for this tub when I was pregnant with my second child. I thought that it was a great idea to have a tub that you could use until your child was ready for the big tub. What a disapointment. I didn't really have alot of problems setting it up, but it does leak now after 6 mo. of use. If I bathe my child quickly, then there is still water left in it after the bath, but there is no need to unplug the drain! The underside of the infant seat is rough on little legs, and more care should've been taken in it's design. I think I am going to stick with a one piece tub from now on."
1,IT DOES LEAK,"I have read conflicting reviews on this product. I have to say I have locked the tabs and still had a leaking problem. Don't waste your money. The sling is great, but is sold separately."
3,leaky,"I bought this tub when my daughter was born in June 2000. I didn't like the fact that because you could close it up the space in the middle leaked which meant you had to bathe her quickly, that got aggravating. I didn't use it for very long."
1,not good,this item is not good at all. it looks good but its links alot.wheneve i pick it up from the floor to go and empty the water it links heavy. i recommend that you fix the problem or you stop selling it.because alot of people are complaining abort that particular item .snooner or later customers would stop buying that item because it does not worth buying.
1,question,"Thank all you moms for taking the time to write these reveiews. I know time is precious being a 2 week new mom myself. I was going to purchase this but now have changed my mind. First, to all those it didnt work for, dont throw them away, take them back and get your money or credit back. even if u dont have the box or receipt. The product doesnt do what it says. get your 20 dollars back. And, second has anyone found a good tub. if so let me know. please thanks, and remember to take a lil time for yourselves ;) Lisa @ nonamesleft34@aol.com"
1,This ruined my bed,"After trying to put this together I thought I had it and laid out plastic on the bed I put the tub down and put water in it. My daughter is premature so we keep her in the bedroom. All the water leaked out onto my bed, and ruined it. I had to get a whole new bed. Do not by this it is a bad purchase."
1,THIS TUB IS THE WORST!!,"Unfortunately I registered for and received this tub. Locking the tabs in was difficult. Now after just 1.5 months of use, the tabs no longer lock properly and the tubs leaks and is useless. I went out and just bought a [inexpensive] standard tub and am much happier with it. The 4-in-1 is a piece of junk!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TUB,Mix a tub that is two pieces and a very poor seal between the two pieces and what you get is a kitchen counter and floor with water everywhere and a screaming kid.
2,Find something else,I was excited by the idea that this tub could be used at different stages so I registered for it. The only good thing about the tub is the sling. It leaks. We have tried everything and it still leaks large amounts of water. My friend had the same tub and it leaked for her so she exchanged it for something else.
1,Worst Ever,"I wish that I could give this zero stars. I bought this when my daughter was born, and only ever used the insert. I hated the actual ""tub"". I had lots of trouble getting it to snap into place for use and had terrible problems with the water leaking out everywhere. I ended up putting it in the tub and tried to use it there, but finally gave up. It folds up for storage, but is still bulky and I had no where to put it. It ended up beside the bath tub with bath toys in it. I finally threw it in the trash after a year."
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT - DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!,"Of all the items I received from my baby registry, this was the WORST! The bathtub was very hard to snap together and it leaked from day one. Until I could get to Toys R' Us to purchase another one, I would have to fill the tub, lay my daughter in it and try to bathe her before all the water leaked out (which was a matter of two minutes). Also, since she is a newborn, I used the sling and she would slide all the way to the bottom (which has a metal bar) and her tailbone would get all red. Ouch!When I took the bathtub back (as it was defective) to exchange it for a different one, someone came in right after me and returned the same bathtub for the same reason!Don't not waste your time or money on this terrible product!!!!"
2,Going to take back,"I received this for a shower gift and the first opportunity I have, I will return it. My baby is 4 weeks old and it took both my husband and I to bathe him in about an hour. Nothing fits in our sinks, so we ended up putting it in the bathtub, you have to hold on strongly to him on the sling while the other bathes. It also leaked all over the bathroom floor while being plugged. Therefore, I am returning and going to plan B."
1,"Hate it, Hate it, Hate it!","This is the first review I've ever written, and that says a lot about the depth of my feelings for this bath tub. Where to begin? Let's see...the infant insert that baby lays on doesn't have a smooth transition, so baby's bottom is sitting on a hard metal bar, and baby constantly slides down while you are trying to bathe her. In addition, it's designed to slide together for more compact storage, but that's the biggest joke of all! It's difficult to get it to slide out again, and when you do get all the locks in place, and fill it with water, it leaks! You can't move it after you fill it, without it leaking all over the place, so you have to have a kitchen sink sprayer or fill it and bathe baby in the bath tub--hard on a body that has just gone through a long labor and is still recovering. We tried to make it work, but...it's now in the garbage."
1,Not my first choice,I received this tub as a shower gift. Like many other people we have had problems with the tub leaking with the tub opened correctly. The tub is great now that my daughter is able to sit up in it to splash around and we keep it inside our regular tub. I would not recommend this tub for small infants. I had much better luck with a cheaper tub that fits perfectly in the kitchen sink.
3,Ok - but not the greatest!,"I wouldn't say this tub is awful, but I do have a couple of complaints. I like the sling that comes with the tub but I think it is a little to steep, every few seconds I was moving my baby back up to the top. Once he was big enough to use the seat I found that the edges were rather sharp. Also, as I have read before, cleaning the tub is rather difficult because of all the lips and creases. All in all, great concept but needs some improvements."
2,"Never used it, but the sling itself is a better idea alone.","I registered for this 4-in-1 Bath Station by Safety 1st and received 2 of them at my baby shower, so I went to the store to return the extra. But after a little thought I realized how useless the tub itself was- how long do you actually use it?..."
1,Horrible product,"When I registered for this item, I thought it was a great product because it could be folded up and stored away easily. I opened the box and tried to put this thing together and I couldn't. I think it was defective. I struggled and practicly hurt my fingers trying to slide the tabs into place. I returned it to the store and bought another tub that doesn't fold up."
1,This tub is not safe!,"This tub is not a safe tub. The sling does not hold the baby in place; instead it is a slide for the baby to slip further into the water. My daughter is 5 months old and loves the tub, but I can't keep her in the tub for very long as she slides down within seconds of being placed on the sling. The sling is also supposed to snap into place, and it does, but not very strong. My daughter kicks her feet in the tub, and the sling comes unsnapped and starts to slide off the back making the sling shorter, and the water near her head deeper. I end up holding her the whole time which does not allow for bathtime fun. I would not recommend this tub at all."
3,"Only one problem, the sling","I really like it even tho my son is only two weeks old and we really haven't had a chance to use this tub to its full potential yet. My husband did want me to mention that the sling (as recommended for newborns) is WAY too big to fit into any sink. No problem we kept it in the tub and attached the tub to the counter next to the sink. Also my son keeps sliding down the sling. Not only is there nothing to hold him in place, the sling is almost too slippery itself and he can end up in a heap at the bottom if one doesn't hang on tight enough. Other than that, I really like it and have no complains as of yet."
2,Don't Buy This!,"My daughter constantly slides down the sling. Every minute or two, I am lifting her back up as she slides down into the water. Unless you have it opened and locked absolutely perfectly, it leaks all over the place"
2,Keep Looking,The suction cups DON'T LET GO!! It takes forever to get them off to move or empty the tub. My son just slides down the sling so I constantly have to slide him back up. It LEAKS!
1,Plese don't buy this bath station!,We bought it for our baby and after 3 months we hate it!! Even after reading the instructions it worked ok for about 1 month and then it started to LEAK. Please purchase a different one.
1,I DO NOT LIKE IT,"Oh my gosh, talk about a pain. I don't have the money to be buying things left and right if they don't work. I counted on this bath tub to be useful from the start- not to be bought and then not useable until our baby is 6 months. The sling doesn't hold my baby in place, the tub leaks all over everywhere if you barely move it- whats the point?All I wanted was to get my baby clean, in the shortest amount of time, no hassle. I read the directions..re read the directions, and then read them again. Things haven't changed. I don't feel this tub is worth the money if I have to buy something else to use for my baby until he is 6 months or more. I hope it works even then...who knows."
3,Not all that great,I chose this tub because it is supposed to slide together for easy storage. It is very hard to get it to slide together and then just as hard to pull it back out to full size and snap it into place. In fact one time I pinched my finger in it trying to snap it into place so I don't even bother. We had a problem with it leaking at first but that was because it wasn't together right. The sling that comes with it is nice for bathing small babies and the tub is a good size/depth for bigger infants who can sit up. I gave it a 3 because we use it daily but it is a pain because we have a small bathroom and not much room to store it.
1,Totally Agree - Leaking Nightmare,"I had this tub for about 5 months and attempted to wash my son at our brand new home on the counter - I had water run out everywhere - not just a little leak. I could never get it to lock in place correctly. I used it until he was older by placing it in the bathtub so if it leaked it did not matter. Another complaint was the design of the hard ring. When my son was just starting to sit up, he would slide in the tub and hit his privates on the hard ring. He did not cry, but I wish the ring was adjustable."
1,It leaks!,"I would give this tub a good review, IF it didn't leak. But, IT DOES LEAK. It is helpful in every other way, but you always have to wipe up the water afterwards. I believe it is leaking from where the thing slides together at. Anyway... try getting a tub that does NOT slide apart, one that is all in one piece."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!,"What a total waste of money. Not only does the bath tub leak but it is was also not comfortable for my daughter. When you are using this tub for an infant it tells you to use the sling...WELL, the sling does not fit correctly in the tub, plus it rests against the hard plastic so my daughters neck was against the hard tub. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,It leaks!!,"Terrible tub! We mistakenly used twice and it leaked both times...not from the center where it takes muscles to push it down to snap properly, but leaky on the sides...and then the suction cups stuck it to the counter and water went everywhere!!! I'm going to still try to return it ASAP!"
1,Leaks,"My son is ten weeks old and is to big for the sink. So I thought putting the bath tub on the counter and using it would be easy, convient and less stress on my back. The tub leaked all over my counter top and cabinets. I would not recommend this tub unless you were going to use it in a tub. And it will still leak."
1,Terrible tub,"I don't know but DH and I both tried to ""push hard"" on the middle of the tub where it says and it still leaks. My baby's 1st bath it leaked all over my counter. I had to put it in the big bath tub and put water in the bottom of that so it didn't leak when we bathed him. HUGE inconvienience. This tub will be returned to babysrus ASAP. We went out and bought the Ocean Wonders one instead and LOVE it."
1,It Leaks,I got this as a shower gift. I used it once and I am glad it was in the bath tub because it leaked like a garden hose that was turned on. I took it back as soon as I could.
1,ugh...,I got this tub for my baby shower for my daughter. I have to say its not at all a good tub for an newborn. Its a pain to empty and fill. The suction cups on the bottom are so hard to get off once they stick to something. Its a big big pain.I do love the sling that came with it and will be using that part for our new baby due in just a few weeks.but the tub its self went to the trash about 3 months after my daughter was born 17 mo ago.Buy something else.
1,Save your money-- use your sink!,"I registered for this bath tub for my shower and got it as a gift. We set it on our counter, started filling it up, and it leaked ALL OVER our brand new custom kitchen! and to make matters worse, the suction cups made it difficult to hurry-up-and-pick-it-up as the water was going all over the place!We do however, use the the baby positioner that gets placed inside it.... it's perfect for our sink. If we'd known that, we would've just bought one of those for $5 instead. If you need a tub, and can't use your sink, I'd recommend getting a ONE PIECE tub, as this one is not, and can make a big mess!"
1,"Difficult to Clean, Difficult to Use","At first I really enjoyed using this tub for my son, until I ran into problems converting it to use the different positions.I tried to set the tub up so my son could sit in the ring as displayed in the picture but ran into the following problems:1. the tub floor was too slippery when wet and my son would slip towards the pole between his legs so I held him so he wouldn't hurt himself,2. when sitting in the ring the pressure from my son's weight caused water to leak from the middle part of the tub that ""clicks"" shutThis was all just too much trouble and then on top of it all after months of using the tub, when I went to lift up the ring to flip it into the sitting position I found there was mold growing under the base of the ring (disgusting!!). Not only that but there are other crevices in the tub that are just too difficult to clean.If I were to do it over I'd just buy a simple plastic tub. This one is just intended to do too much."
1,"So many problems, we never even used it!!","I was really excited about this tub, thinking it would fullfil all of our needs- I was wrong! We tried using the tub sling in our sink when my son was about 4 weeks old. He would slide right off of it. It was more work having it in the sink than to just go without. Now as for the tub itself- I tried, my husband tried, as well as several other relatives, and if there is a way to use it without it leaking water....we couldn't figure it out!! Lastly, the amount of effort it took to pull the bath to full size, or to push it together for storage was more trouble than anyone would want to mess with. If you decide to give this tub a try, keep the box! We just ended up throwing ours away and buying a new tub."
2,Not the greatest investment,I don't like this tub because it is so very hard to open and close properly. Everytime i go to pinch the sides in to close it i always get hurt. Today my arm got pinched in it and i have a cut and bruise because of it now because i was tring so hard to get it closed. it's very hard to keep the plug closed as well. once it's opened it's an okay tub but when it's time to close it again you go through hell. i hate talking 15 minutes to open it and then another 15 minutes to try and get the thing closed. I would definetly tell someone to go and search for a better tub.
1,Terrible Bath,"I took this bath back after opening it and finding that nothing seemed to work right. The directions tell you to press down on the center ""button"" to ensure that it doesn't leak. Supposedly you're supposed to hear it ""snap"" into place. My husband (who is 6ft 3in tall and weighs 200 pounds couldn't make it go ""snap"". Also the baby sling didn't fit securely into the bath so I worried that it wasn't safe. I took it back and got a baby sling-type thing that fits in the kitchen sink, it was only $9.99 and made by Especally for Baby."
1,Terrible Tub!!!,"I received this tub as a gift at my baby shower. I looked at it and thought what a great idea for a tub. Wrong!! First of all, the tub leaks. You cannot let go of the baby for one second beacause they will slide. My son absolutely hated bath time until I bought the seat that sits in the bath tub and now he is happy. The sides of the ramp are hard and if they move there head to quickly they could hurt themselves. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
2,Nothing but a headache!,"I have been attempting to use this tub with my newborn daughter and its a hastle! the sling isnt sturdy AT ALL and the tub is so hard to fold up.. this tub might be easier to use with an older baby, ill have to wait and see.. but with a newborn its impossible!"
2,It leaked!,"We received the tub as a gift. It was wonderful until we tried to collapse it and then expand it again. We could not get it to stop leaking and had lots of messes! If it had a better seal, it would have been a great tub."
3,IT LEAKS!,We received this tub as a shower gift. I was very pleased with it until I realized that it was leaking! We wanted to return it purchase one of the many better made tubs out there but we threw away the box. I now give him baths in the kitchen sink. I would not recommend this product.
2,Watch out for LEAKS,"We have found that this tub tends to spring a leak around the seal. During the bath we have to be on the lookout for water gushing out of the middle of the tub. Also, the tub in ""storage"" mode is not that much smaller than the tub in the fully extended position. I would avoid this product and get a one piece bathtub."
2,WATER LEAKS!!!!,"DON`T WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!I GOT IT AS A GIFT ON MY BABY SHOWER, AND ONLY USE IT A COUPLETIMES BECAUSE IT LEAKS A LOT!!!"
3,Decent tub,"After reading the bad reviews, I was hesitant to buy this tub. However, I ended up getting it because others said it was one of a few that was long enough to fit their baby comfortably. Yes, I agree that the directions aren't great and the tabs are tough to snap down. Once you snap them down, there's only a little lip to keep them in place. BUT, it hasn't leaked yet. I like the sling -- it cradles my 2-month old daughter so I can use both hands to wash her. Suction cups are great for keeping the tub in place on the sink top. Drain hole is helpful -- it's not over the sink bowl, but I just I slide it over when I'm done and drain it. Folding the tub doesn't really save that much room, I wonder why the manufacturers even bothered doing that since it seems to be the cause of the problems people write about here. So far we like the tub -- so does our baby!"
1,LEAKY TUB,"I would NOT recommend this tub ... First of all, you must read the directions a few times to understand how to ""lock"" the tub in place so it does not leak ... the first time we filled the tub the water came pouring out all over the counter and floor .. once we thought we finally had it locked into place, it still was not locked and leaked again ... finally, when it was locked, it held the water for the length of bath time, but still slowly leaked so by the time baby is done and dressed and you go back to empty the tub, your counter top is soaking wet! Buyers beware ..."
1,I wouldn't recommend this product!,"I registered for this thinking I was getting a great deal. However, it is really not a user friendly tub. My husband had to 'lock' the tub for me because I couldn't get the tabs down. Once we got it in the locked position, I didn't ever collapse the tub because of the difficulty."
2,Sling is good but the tub leaks,"I bought this tub as one of my friend suggested it. For first six months it worked really great for me. My daughter loved to take a bath on the sling. Sling is convinient to use. But now as my daughter sits her own, I wanted to soak her in the tub filled with water and toys. But this tub could not hold water. It leaks from both sides. So if you want your baby to have fun after she starts sitting, then this product is total no no. Only useful for smaller babies to give bath on the sling."
2,Very Leaky!,"Initially I thought this would be great & last a long time. However, I quickly realized that this tub leaks very easily from the bottom. I followed the directions & it still leaks...my son can only take a 30 second bath in this thing. In the beginning, it was ok, probably because the baths were short and sweet and we didn't notice, but it is very annoying. Unless it is reworked to not leak so easily, I would not recommend this tub"
2,It does leak,For the few times that we actually used this it did leak so we had to use it in the tub. I think the kitchen sink works best!
1,Piece of TRASH!,"Well, for starters I never even used the sling b/c it takes away the use of one of your hands, so now that my daughter is sitting up, I figured I would try it out in the tub. She slides down so far, the cross that keeps them up splits her in half, the suctions do not work on the bottom if your tub is textured, and you will break a finger trying to condense and open it again. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,I was satisfied,"I liked this tub. My son also likes this tub. He likes to lay on his sling or sit on the tup and splash water around. He used to hate baths, but when we got this, he loved it. It never leaked, but we do leave it on the extended position because it was a hassle opening it and closing it. We give the baby a bath every night and clean it right after so we never had a problem with mold or anything. The only thing is, when I fill it up with water and I put it on the sink, it's pretty heavy and the suctions work a little too good, so it's kind of complicated lifting it and trying to get the suctions to not suck and making the water not spill at the same time."
1,More than meets the eye,"First problem we had was that yes, it leaked all over, I figured out that I had to turn it upside down and even though it looked locked, I had to put a lot of pressure on the bottom to lock it into place. Once it was open, there was no way we were gonna continuously colapse it and go through the hastle of re-opening it. So it stays open and in the extra bathroom. Two of the sucksion cups came off, screw and all after a few uses. It is difficult to clean due to multiple small openings. After a few months I took it completely appart into 3 pieces (the way it came in the box) and to my suprise mold and mildew had started to form hidden where the two halves come together. YUCK! Wish I would have just gotten a plain tub and a plain seat later."
1,horrible,This bath tub is not good. The baby slides down the blue holder and the babies head can emerg under the water. You have to hold the babies head while washing him/her. I would not recommend this product to anyone!
2,Not the Best,"This worked well when my daughter was smaller and had to lay on the sling. It did leak, I always had to place a towel under it.I changed it to the sitting position last night since she is now a good sitter. She ended up with bruises on her knees. The blue plastic piece is not soft so with her kicking scratched her and bruised her."
1,Piece 'o' crap!,"I thought I was getting a real deal and that we'd be able to use this tub from birth to toddler-hood. The sling sucks. My daughter slid down into the tub. We put the tub away and got it back out at 5 mos and she still slid down the sling. We tried having her sit and because there's nothing to keep her from sliding, she kept slipping there as well. Because of the uneven surfaces, I can't lay her flat in it and there's really not enough room to bathe her in it. My biggest gripe THE FRIGGIN' THING LEAKS EVERYWHERE. It doesn't matter what you do to try to stop it either. If you have it and like it, great. But don't insult the HUNDREDS of people who hate it."
1,horrible product,"i purchased this bath tub for my baby girl and only used it twice. it's a nightmare to put this product together and it leaks! i wouldn't recommend this to anyone. it's nervewracking enough to bathe a newborn without the added frustration of having to deal with a leaking, bulky and completely impractical bathtub."
1,To hard to use,"If all you want to do is get your baby clean, get an easier tub to use. This tub was hard to operate, and I don't think you should need to ""operate"" a baby bath. There is alot of preparation needed to make sure that everything is in the right place and it won't leak. Once I got everything fully opened and locked, I couldn't get it to close back down to storage size. I am returning this tub and getting something less complicated."
1,One Good Thing...,"The only good thing about this tub is the sling. The sling has helped me give my little girl her baths in the sink. Because babies are so slippery when they are getting their baths, the sling helps keep their tiny heads out of the water. The tub itself is pretty much a waste of time and money. I have tried numerous times to use the tub, but it keeps leaking on me, no matter what. The tub collapses, which sounds like a great idea, but when it is in use it leaks where there is a ""seal"". My husband and I have both got to the point where we have stood inside of the tub to try to make the seal tighter. The next tub I buy will be one that is all in one piece and that does not collapse."
4,Great product,"I registered for the tub and received it as a gift. I was a little skeptical because of the bad reviews (but we needed something that would grow with our daughter since we do not have a tub - only a shower).I would recommend this tub to anyone. It is easy to use and does NOT leak. We have a small bathroom and it fits perfectly on the counter next to the sink. The sling is at a perfect angle. Our daughter loves bathtime. We usually have to put a towel under the end of it because she splashes alot, but it has never leaked.It was relatively easy to put together - just make sure it clicks and you will have no problems."
1,DO NOT BUY IT!!!!,"THIS PRODUCT IS THE WORST. I AM A MOTHER OF THREE SO I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PUT THINGS TOGETHER PRETTY EASY, BUT THIS TUB IS THE WORST. I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE DETAIL AND STILL COULD NOT GET IT TO STOP LEAKING FROM THE BOTTOM. AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR TRYING TO GET THIS TUB TO STOP LEAKING, MY NEWBORN FELL ASLEEP AND I ENDED UP BATHING HER IN THE SINK WITH THE SLING IT PROVIDES.I AM GOING TO RETURN THIS PRODUCT AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE. GOOD LUCK!!"
4,A good thing to have,"I received this as a shower gift. It is great for those tiny little babies. My son was very small, and having this tub made giving him a bath much easier than just holding him in the sink or full size tub. The sling option is great for several months, then the safety ring is great for the next stages. My son loves bath time, and I feel safe using this bath station."
1,This tub is a nightmare !!!!,"1.It is very hard to assemble.2.It leaks water everywhere3.It is hard to disassembleI was so happy of the idea of having a 4 in 1 tub, but this tub is a nightmare!!!. It made my baby bath first experience a terrible one. Use your energy for something better than having to struggle with this tub. DO NOT BUY !!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This tub leaks everywhere. When I tried to move it to drain the water, it went everywhere. I do not recommend this tub as my son is only 7 weeks old, and we will be buying another one to replace this piece of junk."
2,Find something better...,We had so many problems with this tub when our baby was an infant - we ended up buying something else. The only good thing that I can say about it is that it comes apart and you can use the seat in a regular bathtub.
1,Bad Buy,"I really recommend another product - anything would be better.I couldn't get the bath to clip togther properly, my husband couldn't either - so we gave up. We just pushed it together and the water leaked out. My baby was small and he was very uncomfortable in it and slipped around alot.The only bit I finally used was the sling over my knees when we were both in the bath - and its use was limited. This is too gimicky - try a good old fashioned tub."
2,DO NOT BUY!,"Not too happy with this product. I wanted this because it had different stages, but I'm not able to use them because the darn thing leaks so bad. My son loves to take baths, but we have to keep refilling it to keep water in it. I've read the directions, pulled it, locked it, and it still leaks. If you do decide to buy this baby bath, please make sure you use it in your bath tub or you'll have a nice mess to clean up. I would not recommend buying this tub."
2,Leaky tub and smells,"We originally liked this tub. The idea is great, but once you begin using it you realize the problems right away. On a flat surface, our kitchen counter, the tub leaked a little. Once you went to move it to drain it, it leaked everywhere. It never seems like it locks the way the pictures on the box show, but there is no other way to lock it open. Also, the rubber pad on the bottom and the cloth ""sling"" smell very quickly. You have to wash the sling portion every day or so. We only used this for about a month and then went and bought the Primo Euro tub. We just got that so I can't really comment on it yet. I don't recommend the 4 in 1 bath station in it's current form. Needs to be reworked."
2,No leaks but sling issues....,I bought this tub because my very long son (27.5 inches at 4 months) outgrew the other tub I had received as a gift. I liked the fact that this tub was long enough for him to stretch out his legs and kick and splash as he wished. My biggest problem with the tub is that the sling never snapped into place for my son to lay on. It constantly slid around and I constantly had to readjust him and the sling. With a squirmy 4 - 5 month old it makes it very difficult to give him a bath. I did contact the manufacturer and they are going to refund me $12.37 which is not the full price. I am now going to be shopping for a new tub after owning this one for only 1.5 months. Otherwise it is a great tub and I haven't had leaks. If you can't try the sling in the store first then don't buy this - definitely don't buy online because you can't test it out!
1,Yuck!! Yuck!! Yuck!! What a waste of money!!,I wish I had never bought this tub. It was a waste of money. I went back and bought a less expensive tub that is all one piece. Not worth the money in my opinion.
1,Not as handy as I thought it would be,"I bought this thinking it would be the perfect grow-with-baby tub. I found that it was just a waste of money. The infant part did not keep my daughter from slipping at all! and it did not fit in the sink, not even close! I will be purchasing a different solution for my new baby that's for sure!"
2,'The Cutting Edge',"I put this tub on my registry before reading the reviews written about it. If I had known that so many were going to be bad, I would've chosen something else. It did do its job for several months, but the weirdest thing happen last night as I was bathing my son. He was sitting in the tub with his elbow resting on the ring. He arm slid down against the plastic ring and he started crying. When I looked down to see what happened, I noticed that the ""plastic"" ring took off some skin and he was bleeding. After that happened, I threw out the tub, and now am looking for one that is more efficiently designed. Possibly a Snug Tub."
2,Do not think you are collapsing this tub,"I returned this tub. It is nice if you do not plan to collapse it, otherwise be prepared to rip your cuticles off. It's very difficult and cheap the way it collapses."
1,get another tub,"I got this tub for my first and second child. I thought the first one maybe was defective because it leaked so much, I had to put it in my tub to use it, it was also difficult to clean and the head pad peeled off after just a few uses. I just received it again for my second child and it was leaking again all over my bathroom counter--needless to say it is in the garbage can outside!!"
3,"Loved it at first, but not so much later","Well, I loved it when we first had our daughter. She never cried during her baths. LOVED IT!Then she began to grow & by 5 months of age, she still couldn't sit up, but the tub was way too small. I wish it was somewhat larger."
1,don't buy this!,"I could not get this tub to not leak! It looked very cool in the store, but when I went to go and use it for the first time, it was terrible. I was holding a naked 2 month old and could not get the tub to stop leaking all over the floor, it was a disaster. How this tub is supposed to hold the water in without leaking is simply beyond me. My husband tried too, he could not figure it out either!"
1,"Tried everything,even reading directions, but it still leaks","Do not buy this tub!!! What a hassle when it leaks all over the kitchen counter and the floor. The leaking distracts you when you should be paying extra attention to the baby. I read the directions and also had my husband and my mother try to fix the leaks, with no success. Also the sling does not stay in the holes and pops out constantly."
4,Good Tub,"My son loved this tub! He probably would have loved any tub, but this one worked very well for us. The only time the seam leaked for us was when my husband tried to use it without fully expanding the tub. The sling in the sink worked very well for my son when he first got home (at 4 lbs! we had a preemie). And the sling worked well the entire time I used it, up till the time he could sit. I'm not sure what those people who say it doesn't support are talking about at all. If you don't want your baby to slide off the sling (in any tub) place a wet washcloth (adult size works best) flat on the tub floor beneath their bottom and the baby won't slide! As far as not having a hand on a small infant, well, it's probably a good idea to have a hand ready to give support at all times...they do new things all the time and boy do they surprise you with new tricks at the worst possible moments. Good luck to all!!"
1,The only good thing is the sling.,"I used this bath for the first 3 months and it was great when using the sling, but when my son got too big for the sling and was sitting up, we tried the sitting position. But my son would just slip down and would cry because it was uncomfortable for him. I would not recommend this bath tub. There are other tubs with slings that are much better."
1,No Good!,We registered for this tub because we thought it would save money by growing with our child. It turns out it was a waste of money! It leaks horribly and is not very comfortable for baby! The only thing we ended up using out of it was the sling and even that wasn't great. It started falling apart before our son was 4 months old! I wouldn't recommend this tub for anyone!
3,Leak Issue,I really liked this tub because it would change with my growing child. The first time we used it the water slowly leaked out the bottom. The section where the tub fits together does not form a perfect seal so the water leaks. I'm very disappointed because it causes a mess everytime. Would not advise you purchase this particular tub.
2,wish I researched,"When preparing for my daughter's arrival, I researched many items, but didn't think much about a bathtub. I figured there wasn't much to think about. I selected this one and have been very disappointed. It leaks every time I give my daughter a bath. The sling never locks in place and is unstable. I definately wouldn't reccommend it. I'm shopping for a new tub."
1,Don't buy this leaky piece of junk!,"We bought this tub when we were expecting our first child. For the first month or two, this tub worked fine. After that, it started to leak even with the clips on the underside properly secured. If I filled it to the top, it would still be empty within 2 minutes--not nearly long enough to bathe a baby! We wound up throwing it away and just taking ""momma and baby"" baths together until our son was old enough to stand up in the shower with me. Now that we are expecting baby #2, we plan on trying the Eurobather. It's a little more expensive, but doesn't have any negative reviews!"
1,They should stop making this tub,"I thought this would be a great tub as we really needed a space-saving tub. It fit perfectly on the kitchen counter and it was easy to drain the water right into the sink. Well after a couple months I thought I was just careless and not fully extending the tub out to locking position (which the locking tabs are also hard to lock and release- you need pretty strong thumbs!), as several times I had water all over the counter and dripping down the cabinets. The problem with this tub is the rubber stripping which is at the seam between the two halves of this tub. It was completely twisted and coming off. There is not enough room to get your fingers in to fix it or replace it. As time went on the tub was leaking so bad I had to put it into the real bathtub in the bathroom. It eventually stopped holding water altogether. When I see people with this tub in their shopping carts, I immediately tell them about this tub and they can't put it back fast enough."
1,Fed up,I purchased this tub because I really liked the concept of being able to expand it as necessary yet not have it so large for a newborn. It has been a disaster and leaks all the time. Definitely not worth the money.
1,Frustrated and Sore!,"Don't waste your money, I spent half the morning trying to get the tab in the bottom of the tub to ""lock"" in place. Also, releasing the tabs for ""easy"" storage was a nightmare. If you have weak hands this is not the product for you. My thumbs are killing me. I was afraid the locks would pinch my skin. Also, I agree on the slippage of the sling, one moment the baby up high, the next sinking into the water. Not a very user friendly product."
1,???,"I recieved this tub as a shower gift. My first thought was that the tub was way to big. The first time I used it I filled it up and then went to get my son. When I came back half of the water was gone out of it. I thought that I hadn't locked it right and had my husband lock it in place and refilled the bath. Still water kept leaking out. So, in order to give my son a bath I had to keep water running into it, not fun. Even though this was a gift I wouldn't recommend buying it."
2,Leaky!!!!,"I purchased this tub because of all the features it had. It seemed great, and would be if it held water. I have reset it up time and time again to no avail. I have to rush through bathtime with my four month old before the water is all gone."
1,LEAKS!!!,"I've had this tub for four months and it now leaks on the bottom. Ever since we started using it, our son constintly slides down the sling. Now at four months of age he is into kicking, the plastic is not rounded off on the corners and he hits his little feet on the top. Great ides, but doesn't work."
1,New Mommy,"I received this tub as a shower gift. The concept was a great idea--I assumed we'd love the product. It was a little tough to get the tabs locked in, but between hubby and myself, we got it secure. The sling doesn't have much ""give"" to it, baby didn't look comfortable, and her bum slipped right down to the end--not very user friendly. The tub started leaking after the second bath--water dripped everywhere. The tub is large and unweildy. It does not fit in the sink for infant bathing. Purchased a Three Stage Baby Bather by The First Years, and I gave that tub a 5 star rating."
1,terrible bath tub,"The tub can be used only in your regular tub. This isn't specified anywhere. If you need to move it, it leaks all over the place. Is too big for infants. It folds only for storage purposes. I wouldn't recommended to anybody!"
2,"Yep, it leaks.","I have also been frustrated with this tub because it leaks. I have to keep filling it up throughout bathtime so I can wash and rinse my son. And to the lady who thinks that those of us complaining of leaks are just not locking the tabs in...come on! We can follow directions, too! Even when it's ""locked in,"" it leaks! Even though it's a great idea, I can't recommend this product."
1,Flooded Bathroom Counter Twice,"I do not recommend this product. The tub is in two seperate pieces that snap together in order to hold the water. Both times when I snapped the tub together the water still leaked through the cracks. It never held enough water to give my baby a bath, it merely flooded the counter."
1,flawed design!!,"I would rate this a lump of coal rather than give it a star if I had the option. It is a physical impossibility to fully extend this tub without at least 3 arms. I broke 2 nails backwards trying to extend the tub fully, so as to ""prevent leaking"". The safety latches will not engage unless you have 2 large men pulling on each end while a third party clicks the safety tabs. Ultimately the ""safety tab"" broke. I only had it out of the box 15 minutes before I was not only in pain because of this product, but angry and physically exhausted. Spare yourself. Now I have to take it back!"
1,Piece of Junk!,"I saw this tub at the store and added it to my registry. I received it as a gift and sent it back the same day. I had not tried it out first at the store, only read about its features on the box. It is near impossible to close it up to make it storgae size. I had to get a screwdriver out to push the plastic tabs in to close it. The infant sling did not clamp into the slots. Just a headache! I prefer The First Years Sure Comfort Deluxe Tub. It fits perfetly to the sink if you want it to. Very user friendly."
2,Not the best for baby.,"I recently received this as a shower gift. For all you mother's with a newborn I wouldn't recommend this product. The swing isn't the safest for your baby. It doesn't snap into place like the instructions say that it is suppose to. Also, when I opened the box for the first time the sides were cracked and since I didn't have a receipt I couldn't return it. I had to go buy another bathtub for my infant to bathe in. I wouldn't advise anyone to purchase this product nor give it as a gift."
2,leaky and bulky,"We received this tub as a shower gift from our registry. Initially the tub sounded like a wonderful idea, but when set at the small size the tub leaks only adding more clean up for you. When we adjusted the tub to the larger size hoping to correct the leak, the tub leaked again. After trial and error, and a large wet mess, we realized that the tub must be completely level not to leak. What a pain, who has all the time to level the tub and pray it won't leak? We really like the bath cot and it supports the baby well in the tub, but you can buy these separately."
1,All Wet!,"This product would be great, if it worked. The sling was a good idea, but I used it only in my big bathtub, because the 4 in 1 bath station leaked so much water I couldn't keep it full."
2,Not worth the $,"I liked three things about this tub, but it didn't make up for the things I did not like. 1, the tub is roomy, which I look for. 2, the mesh support worked really well for my 5 month old. And 3, it holds lots of water, helping to keep baby from getting chilled.I did NOT like the fact that I could *not* move this tub, not even an inch. It leaked as well. The option to collapse and fold up for storage was not beneficial because it was very difficult to do. I bought this tub just a couple weeks ago and returned it after giving my son one bath in it."
3,Not the best tub,"I got this tub at a shower and I wish I would have taken it out of the box earlier so that I could investigate it and return it. The tub is very hard to extend and put away. It is so hard to take down that I just leave mine out all the time. The seams in the tub make it hard to keep clean. I also have a problem with the seams leaking, even though I have the tub completely together.The reclining part of the tub is good and comfortable for the small baby, however it is not very secure on the top. Now that my girl is older and sitting up, I tried the ring and she hates it. The plastic has some hard edges and she got two scratches on her the first time I put her in it. My girl is a very active baby and I just did not feel that she was secure enough in this position. I have recently taken out the reclining part and an using it in our bath. She likes this better and is able to splash and play around.I would not buy this tub for anyone because it is very hard to use."
1,Leaky Leaky,"I was so excited when I recieved this tub thinking it would last for years. Well, first you can NOT use it in your home bathtub, because the suction cups will not adhere to a non-slip surface. Most tubs are non-slip, that's what the little bumps are for in your tub. This was fine though, I planned to use it on our kitchen counter. No matter how hard I pressed on the middle ""locking"" device water always leaked out onto the counter and floor. This tub is more trouble than it's worth!"
2,Not baby friendly!!,"This tub was ok the first 3 months, then as my son got bigger and started kicking and waving his arms, he was constantly hitting the very hard plastic, the sling worked better in the regular tub, and when he sat up with the sitting stage, he kept squashing his little self on the hard platic. We've switched to an inflatable tub, and it's wonderful!!"
1,Good thing I checked it out before baby came!,"I am so glad I still have time to return this tub! I was totally frustrated trying to set up this thing. I finally got it to lock into place, but if you want it to condense down for storage, you have to go through a lot of extra effort that I thought was more trouble than it was worth.The thing I disliked most about it is if you have a double-sink, it will not fit. It does not have the space in the middle of the bottom to fit, so I would have to use it in the tub.I thought the design was disappointing as well. Most tubs have a foam cushion all the way down the wall of the tub for baby's comfort, but this one only has a sliver of foam for the head.I am taking this back and getting a ""normal"" tub!"
1,very displeased,I hated this tub. It drains out water as soon as it is put in. Water leaks from the base when the tub is extended to its fullest length. I found it to be more tiring to constantly have another basin of water available when bathing my infant.
1,This tub leaks!,I was VERY dissapointed with this tub.... it looked so cool in the pictures but what a disaster... it leaked so bad that we only used it couple of time before we threw it out. Don't waste your time or money!
5,Still in use for my 2 yr old,"I am amazed at all of the negative reviews because I have had none of the problems others have written about. I had 2 other tubs which my son quickly outgrew (he was over 9 pounds at birth) so I never did use the sling on this tub. I used the tub with and without the sitting ring and my son is still using this tub at 2 yrs old. I keep it in the bathtub, but have folded it up on occasion with no problem whatsoever with unfolding it. There have been no leaks either, although my son does a pretty good job of splashing water out of the baby tub into our regular tub (maybe a source of the mystery water loss others have experinced??).I am planning to use it with my next baby in a few months. I thought it was a good value for the money."
3,Good at the Beginning,I chose this product for my registry without reading any reviews. I immediately began using it with my newborn daughter and it worked great. I loved the idea of the plug because you can empty out all the water easily. The only bad part was that there were many cracks which were difficult to keep clean and dry which would cause to get moldy. I thought that was pretty disgusting. But I continued to keep using it until the bottom just all of a sudden cracked one day and I had to throw it out. Now I am pregnant again and am searching for a better tub for my baby.
1,Never did get to bathe the baby,Most disappointing this about this bath tub was that my 8 year old picked it out by himself for his new born baby brother as a surprise for me. I can't tell you how heart broken he was over the fact that the gift he bought for his brother was not useable.On to the tub...We never used it to bathe our little one (now 4 months) as we could not get it to snap together in order to hold water in. I tried. My husband tried. My mother tried. No luck. Back to the store it went.I can see how other's complaints on the sling and the lack of padding could be a concern. I'm sure I would be agreeing with them if we had ever gotten the chance to use it.
2,sling doesn't snap into place!,This tub looks like it would be wonderful for all stages of your babies growth however the sling does not SNAP securly into place making it very unsafe to lie your new infant in. I would not recommend buying this one for that reason!
1,I would not Recommend it!,"This tub leaks all the time. Even if it is assembled correctly it leaks with higher water level. All of our attempts to use it on a counter ended with having to mop the floor. The tub is too difficult to set up so changing it to storage mode after every bathing is not very convenient. The worst thing is that the tub is already too small for my son who is only 2 months old. The way I see it, only baby under 25 inches could comfortably feet in it. Sling is the only good future that I found helpful. One star is for the sling."
3,Great Concept,"We bought this bathtub with the thought in mind - it compacts down for easy storage. I love the size of the tub, the built in tub ring and the sling that came with it was very helpful. The price was very reasonable too. The only thing I didn't care for is that it was not very easy to snap together and fold it in. We finally just left it extended. Other than that, it is a great product."
2,"I like the sling, but not the tub.","I got this tub for my baby shower. I used the tub for a couple weeks, but I got aggravated with the suction cups and drain hole. It would take a long time for the ""dirty"" water to drain and my baby would be freezing by that time. I ended up tossing the tub in the basement and using only the sling in the tub. It works great. He's 4 months now, weighs 17 1/2 lbs. and I'm still using it. He's able to splash and kick and I can safely wash him with the support. It keeps him on an incline so he can stay warm in the water and I don't have to worry about his ears getting wet. I wish they made something like this for larger babies."
2,Several problems!,My husband and I both have problems getting this tub to latch!! We live in a small apartment and thought that it would be convenient. It takes up an entire shelf in our bathroom. Our son is now old enough to sit up with the bar. There's no tread on the bottom and our son continuously slides and can't sit up straight very well. We've started putting a handtowel underneath him to give him a little extra help. It's riduculous...I would NOT recommend this product to other parents. Spend the extra money and get something more useful!
1,Leaks,Because this tub expands there is a rubber strip to connect the two pieces once it is expanded. The problem is after a while that stip will begin to ware out and not hold the bath water. I do not recommend this one at all. I am now having my second child and this is definetly not on my registery list.
3,"A good product, but not perfect","I really like this 4 in one bath tub. We've used it as our son has grown. As a newborn he would lay on the included sling. We did find that he grew to be too tall for the sling to be used in the small tub, but we'd put the sling in the bathtub which worked great. Now that he can sit up we use the seating ring. We put a washcloth under him to help keep him from slipping. I like that it's small enough that our son isn't intimidated, but it's big enough that he can splash and have fun while he bathes. We can also fill it up deep enough to keep him from getting cold. I'd recommend the product, but there could be improvements made."
1,Waste of money,"I registered for this bath tub and received it as a shower gift. The first (and only) time I used it, it leaked all over my kitchen counter. We returned it. I wish I had read all the reviews on this website first--I would have not selected this product on my registry."
1,New baby-Hate it,"The sling that looks so good in pictures, does not support my baby well. I have been trying to put up with this for several months. My baby is almost 3 months and she still slides down the sling making bath time stressful at best. It may work better as she gets older but I have gotten to the point that I am looking to replace it."
2,NOT SO HAPPY,"I was so thrilled that this would be the last tub I would have to buy. My 11 month old loves sitting up in it, and now that I'm expecting another baby in a few months the sling would come in handy. The only problem is that all of a sudden it leaks tremendously. We also never really closed it up because it was too hard to do but that would have been fine to deal with if it hadn't started to leak. Now we have to rush her out of the tub before all the water leaks out. And with the new baby on the way it looks like we are going to have to invest in another tub. I don't reccommend buying this. Especially since it started to leak after we had it more than 90 days so we couldn't even return it and get something else."
2,"It sure is safe, but it LEAKS!!!","My husband and I really liked the design of this bathtub when we decided to ask for one in our shower list. After using it for only three months my daughter could not enjoy her bath anymore since this bathtub began leaking. We do not recommend this product to any parents. It sure is safe, but certainly cannot be used for too long when the water leaks away!"
2,Do not Recommend,"This tub leaked for me too! And the latched on the bottom of the tub never seem to stay in place for me and it was very difficult to get them into place as well. I do agree that the sling was great and in fact I used it without the tub. My 7 month old, who enjoys sitting while bathing, kept sliding around the tub even with the seat railing in place. I tried laying cloth diapers and towels under her so she wasn't sliding around on the plastic but, it didn't help.I used it up until a couple of weeks ago when I purchased one of those inflatable tubs which my daugther loves. Several of my friends have recently had children or are pregnant and I recommended they not buy this tub for their infants or toddlers."
4,A good tub to have,"I have to admit that this tub does leak, but once you set up on a level table etc.and follow the instructions it is fine. If you try to move or lift it with water in it, it will leak. The bath sling helps to make things easy for me and my wife and Jessica is happier when we use it. We also like the bath ring, it adds a bit of security when baby is sitting. We are happy."
2,Very leaky,"When we first started using this tub we thought it was great, but our son is now 5 months old and we hate it. When we started placing it in the bathtub for baths because our son was splashing all around we had so many problems. The suction cups would stick so hard to the tub that it was impossible to move it away from the faucet without spliing the whole thing or the bottem becoming unsnappped which caused leaks. We removed the suction cups, but the tub still has a steady leak. It's hard enough to bath a slippery baby - don't choose this tub that causes even more trouble."
2,Didn't like it.....,"I took this bathtub back. I registered for it b/c of the space saving feature, but found that it is actually big and bulky. It is hard to snap together... It just isn't a good buy. You are better off with the cheaper ones without the pinchable, snap together nonsense."
1,Can't believe it started to leak so fast!,I purchased this tub back in Febuary when I had my twins.It was recommended to us by the baby store.I could not believe how fast it started to leak.I would not recommend this product to anyone it is hard to bathe one baby but with two. It is very hard to keep clean. Anyway anyone who is thinking about buying it don't. Anyone who already has it don't through it away call the company. They will tell you what to do to get a replacement.
3,Great for newborn but [bad]for a 6 mo + baby,"This tub was great for my newborn because of the sling. Once he started to sit up and we removed the sling, it became dangerous. He slips very easily sideways, forwards and backwards in this tub. We're still using it but I have to keep my hand on him at all times because he easily slips around and can bang his head against the tile wall. The plastic seat that you're supposed to use for a baby this age is very inconvenient to take him in and out of. It also looks kind of sharp even though it's plastic. I'm probably going to buy a new tub soon. Can't take a chance on him banging his head!"
4,LOVED THE RAMP!!!,"Forget the tub...those things are the biggest pain in the neck, I don't care how they're made. But that ramp was SO nice for baths. In the little tub for the first month, and then we used the ramp in the regular bathtub there-after, until our baby was too big for it. It was such a nice cozy place for the baby to lay, no sliding like they do on a hard plastic tub. New babies have no neck control, and this cradles their heads very well. I also found that when he was laying on it, I could use more water. That way, there was warm water on his back and it kept him much warmer throughout his bath. You can take the cover off and wash it, unlike those sponge things you have to throw away after they've been pooped on. I think the plastic tubs are a huge waste of money and such a mess. If you can just buy the ramp part, fantastic, but if you still have to buy the whole thing so you can have the ramp, it will be worth every penny just to get one of those!"
2,Leaky Tub,"After receiving this tub at our baby shower, we were soon disappointed. We used this tub quite a few times after our baby was born and it worked great. Our baby is very long for her age and it works great in that aspect. However, it does leak! After bathing our newborn, we noticed that the tub had been leaking. We won't use this tub again due to the leaking issue. There was a lot of water on the floor (under the tub). The tub was a good idea, but the leaking problem caused us to throw it out."
1,It does leak,"I put this tub in my registry because I though it would be great, and assumed the leak other people reviewed was because improper settings (It does work well for other people), but it happened to me too. Closing it and opening was a hassle too. I did like the insert and I used it alone in the sink for a few days, but I can purchase that separately if I wanted and much cheaper, so I returned the tub. I purchase a bath recline seat for $... and that works way better for the time been (my son is 2 months old), later I will consider buying a tub again, but not that model."
1,NOT A GOOD TUB FOR INFANTS,"I registered for this tub based on the versatility it supposedly offers, however, I found that this tub and bath sling do not work well for infants. My baby kept slipping down on the sling and would have been lying down in the tub if I didn't keep my hand under her bottom the entire. Also, I followed the directions exactly and made sure that everything was snapped into place (which is not an easy thing to do!) and the tub still leaked. Not a huge amount, but who wants a tub that leaks? I ended up purchasing the Summer Infant fold-up bath seat at Babies-R-Us which I highly recommend. It made bath time less stressful for both me and my baby. I plan to try and use this tub again once my baby can sit up and use the bath ring portion. I'm hoping this tub isn't a total waste."
1,Choose a different bath!,"I never typically buy anything without reading reviews, but I thought a bath would be easy, not much to mess up, complain about, or go wrong. I was wrong! I thought this was the greatest, I regestired for it and was happy to get it. My husband gave her the first bath to calm her down when constipated, I was not home. He said it leaked but I thought he did something wrong. I tried the day after, he was right. I tried to problem shoot. No help. There is very quickly no water in it, only a cold, somewhat wet baby. The sling is great, but now I need a new tub. Big mistake, keep looking for another one."
1,4-in1 tub review,The 4-in 1 bath tub leaked on several occassions during set up and with baby inside it. We could only use it in the shower because it leaked when placed on counter tops or table. The bottom is sharp against babies back when laying inside it. The suction cups on the bottom were difficult to work with. I regret buying this product.
1,Horrible Product,"I bought this to replace our in sink tub as my son is growing bigger. Well I got it together and that was a feat in itself. cleaned it out and filled it up and placed in our tub. In went my son into the sitting ring, I began washing he began squirming and kicking his legs as he does normally and he managed to pop half the ring out of the side - now it took me quite an effort to snap this in and my son weighs only 16 lbs. This frightened my son who then began flailing and banged both his knees on the underpart of the ring until I could get him out - mind you his is soaking wet and slippery. He is crying and frantic and I too am upset as he had large red marks on both knees. This product is awful - the underside of the ring has hard sharp edges and there is no way a small baby should be able to snap it open ! Needless to say this product is flying back to the store after it took me > 20 mins to get it to fold back up ??? Waste and unsafe - buyer beware."
3,Great in the beginning,"This product was GREAT when we first brought our son home. We used the sling alone for a while and then put the sling in the infant tub. It was great. Now that he is sitting now so we decided to put the bar in to make sure he was secure. It is very close between his legs and with no resistance on the bottom he slides right into the bar. I am with him and assisting, but I cannot stop him from moving. I also don't like the fact the bar is in the shallow end of the tub...it really doesn't make sense to me. We have graduated to just the tub, minus the bar, its okay except for the hump in the middle.I loved the tub up until he started sitting (about 5 months old). I have had NO problems with leaking and find it very easy to collapse and remove. This is a great beginner tub, but not very useful once they start sitting up well."
3,"Not perfect, but still a good value.","It's not the perfect tub, but we've been using it for a year and it's impressive that it still works for us!For newborns: It didn't fit in our kitchen sink, but you can fill it in the kitchen sink and then set it on the counter, which worked fine for us. It collapses to a smaller size for infants--- and maybe people that complain about that don't realize that? Not sure. The sling was great.It works best in the tub, definitely. It does leak if you don't have it clicked in properly, which is sometimes a challenge.Taking it apart for storage is not something that you want to do on a daily basis. That is kind of a hard process. So we leave it hanging on a hook fully assembled when not in use.It was under $20--- and we are still using it a year later. The blue piece reverses easily and snaps in to create a bath ring. Pretty good value and product longevity for the price."
2,Not a very good design,"The tub is very roomy, but poorly constructed. The sling feature is a good idea, however when the tub is more than half full of water and my son turns his head to the side, water gets in his ears. Also, the bar that is used to help babies sit up crunched my son's little package. He was very uncomfortable sitting up and it was hard to clean his bottom. The tub also has a lot of crevices that make it hard to keep clean."
1,Too much of a hassle,I bought this tub because of the fact that it could grow with my son. Big mistake. First of all it leaks because it is very hard to snap the tub together so i just leave it as is when i store it which takes up space. Second of all my son continually slides off the ramp and because its made of metal it digs into his back every time he slides down. So for instance i am trying to wash his body and he starts to slide down i have to set aside his wash cloth and pull him back up or he'll have an indent in his back. I truly reccommend not purchasing this tub. Please consider these reviews before you purchase a tub.
2,Leaky Tub,"I received 2 tubs at my son's baby shower. I returned the other and kept this one because it seemed like it had more features. I wish I had kept the other because this one seems to leak every time I use it. However, the infant sling thing is nice, and the tub itself is a good size. I think I'd rather get a tub that doesn't leak so much."
3,You can do better,"I like the fact that it's a convertible tub, and I seem to have escaped any kind of leaking problem, but the sling is a pain in the rear. Baby gets playful, kicks his legs, and Mom spends half the time repositioning him on the sling (which operates more like a slide), so that he won't slip all the way into the water. I regret not getting the kind which sling stretches across and keeps baby buoyant. Oh well."
1,DON'T BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!,I was really excited about this tube but it was too hard to assemble. Then it leaked like crazy. The sling is not comfortable at all. It had build up underneath in a place too hard to reach. It was a total waste of money.
2,It leaks,"I pressed and clicked the correct spot like it said in the directions and yet it still leaks. This was a problem because i used it on the kitchen counters for the first week. I had to put towels under it to absorb all the water. So i moved it upstairs to the bathtub and this way i don't have to worry about all the leaks. Really, who wants a tub that leaks???? My daughter is not yet sitting up on her own and yet she is too long to be reclined comfortably in this tub....so we are in an awkward transition phase. a phase that this tub doesn't suitably deal with. I wouldn't buy this tub."
3,NOT a good investment!!,"My husband and I were very interested in this originally when we read how it converted into different combinations for different stages. Unfortunately, we were not able to use it very long before it started leaking - badly!!! Because of the suction cups on the bottom of the tub, you are not able to move it around very much at all. When you try to dump out the water, or move the tub to store it, you have to very carefully break the suction in the suction cups at the bottom of the tub - pretty difficult to do because they really stick to the bottom of the tub. After only a few times of ""fighting with the tub"" we noticed a definite lead in the tub. It quickly got so bad, that no sooner would we fill it with water and put our baby in it, then all the water would have leaked out the bottom! VERY frustrating! We finally just used one a relative gave us that their child outgrew. However, if you can get a lot of use out of it before it leaks, then the sling part is very nice to have."
2,Probably will not buy again,"I bought this tub without doing any research on it. I bought it because I liked the idea of it growing with my baby. Well, I got it together all right but it is WAY too big for the bathroom and/or kitchen sink so I had to put it in the big tub from the very beginning. Also, I have yet to get it to shrink, so I have this huge tub in the bathroom all the time. The sling seemed to work all right when my son was smaller, but now he is 4 months and he loves to kick. However, that causes him to slide down the sling and it's quite hard where the sling ends, so he ends up with this red mark on his lower back. Also, it just doesn't seem to hold water. I have read the directions and everything but the water just leaks out. All in all, I will give this tub another chance once my son gets older and can sit up but if it still leaks, I am getting another one."
2,It an OK product,I bought this thinking it would be great and last for years. Well when my daughter was 3 months old the tub started leaking just a trickle in the middle. I kept using it but it has began leaking worse. The sling puts a red mark on my baby's bottom and now she is sitting up but the slippry plastic causes her to slide all over the place. Several of my friends say they had the same leaking and slipping problems I've had.
1,Miserable tub!,"This tub leaks badly, truly defeating the purpose of a tub - to hold water. I put a towel down under it and it gets soaked. Also, the sling doesn't appear to hook or lock into place and slips around. Skip this one!"
2,"Not for the infant, only the child that can sit up","We purchased this for our infant daughter and I HATED IT!! If your child cannot sit up on his/her own, I would not purchase this. Reason being is that you cannot put too much water in the tub without your child wanting to float away. Plus my daughter's head sat right on the edge and cried the whole time. I used it once and put it away. I use it now that she can sit up on her own and it works great, but wouldn't use it on an infant."
1,Should be recalled,"I was not happy about water leaking under the tub, but got over it. But tonight while bathing my daughter the sling popped out of the holder and her bottom was pinched.....leaving a small welt. I would not recommed this tub now."
1,Terrible product,"This baby bathtub is terrible, it leaks all the time, for more way that we tried to make sure it was well sealed and all that, it still never stopped leaking."
2,Leaky tub,"I wish I had reed the reviews before I registered for this tub. I got it at one of my showers and was so excited with all the features. I was in for a real shock when the first time I went to use it it leaked all over my counter and the floor. I have several friends who recieved the same tub, and had the same problem. I ended up get the the Sure Comfort Deluxe and loved it. My daughter loved to sit in it and take her bath"
2,Great for Newborns and average Babies,"This tub came recommended by a friend so I added it to my registry. It's been great until now since my son is too big for it. He's just five months and not sitting on his own, but he's 27 1/2 inches long so it's difficult to bath him lying down in the sling. I've tried using the blue attachment so he can sit, but he slides. So I tried propping him up with towels for support, but it's very difficult and cumbersome. If your child is average size, it's a great tub. If, however, your child is an above average size, it's not the tub for you."
1,Spend your money else where!!!,"My son hated this tub and since it was his first time taking a ""real"" bath I was scared he would be fearful of baths from then on. Thank goodness we had received two tubs but the other was a lifesaver. Like the other reviews have said the tabs are a pain to mess with to expand the tub. And safety is a huge problem I cut myself when I first tried to get it together and was worried my son would somehow do the same. I would advice looking at other tubs....it may be 4-in-1 but it's not worth it, I'd rather buy four different tubs!!!!"
1,leaky!,"This bathtub started to leak almost immediately after we bought it for our daughter. We only got a month or so of use out of it. Very disappointing! We're expecting another baby now and will be buying a different bath tub this time around, the 4-in-1 bath station was a waste of money."
1,Keep the sling--throw out the tub,"This tub was useless (see other reviews). However, the sling insert worked nicely in our kitchen sink. That said, if you haven't already bought a baby tub, you're better off picking up a cheap sling (or alternative in-sink support) and a cheap kiddie tub (I found one for $5.) If you unfortunately received this as a shower gift, don't hold it against the giver. From the number of bad reviews this item has gotten, you can see that many people were deceived by this apparantly easy to use and practical tub. Sadly, this tub is anything but. Just use the sling and give the tub to someone you don't like."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"This is the most poorly made baby bath I have ever used. It is impossible to get folded and unfolded. When you do get that figured out then you get to deal with the stupid sling. My baby kept slipping down and her ears would get under water. She is now to big for the sling, but to small to sit up in the ring. I gave it a fair try, but I had to go out and buy another bath. It seems like a great concept, but it is really just a waste of [money]."
5,i forgot to mention....,"If slipping is a problem, you can insert one of those large flat oversize baby bath sponges (meant to cushion baby in the bottom of a sink) into the ring seat (curved) or in the deep end (flat) and it keeps baby from sliding in either space. then i wring out the sponge and place it atop the bath as it hangs via suction cups on the wall to dry. it's a snap. I use the sling separately in my oversize kitchen sink for quick clean ups at an alternative ""bath station"" in my house."
4,Like it a lot,"The leaking must be a defect, because I have never had it leak. We use it in our tub and it's great!"
2,"Water, Water Every Where!","I experienced the same leaking problem as most of the other parents. The tub doesn't lock, therefore allowing the water from the tub to leak all over. This forced me to only use the tub inside the big bath tub, which forced me to have to bend over in awkward positions so that I could keep my hands on my baby and wash him. It wreaked havoc on the back! Plus the sling did get very stinky very quickly, even if I squeezed the excess water out of it. Finally, although the ring is a great idea, it's nearly impossible to wash a baby who is sitting in one, and it was difficult for me to get him in and out of it.I would not recommend this tub to anyone unless you don't mind bending over the side of your tub to avoid water all over the place."
2,Poor design,Our baby always slides off of the net sling so during bath time we are constantly having to pull her back up. This to me makes it a pretty poor tub.
1,bad design,"I agree - this item drives me crazy! When you fill it using the ring (for older babies), there is a ridge, so the baby sits up higher on one end. Most of the water sits at the opposite end, so they end up sitting in shallow water. It makes no sense!! (also it leaked when I set it up as well - my husband had to use most of his weight to get it to ""snap"") Wish I had purchased another tub, but at least it is not expensive!"
1,Doesnt work!,"I didnt realize just how many problems this bath actually had before I bough it. The water wont stay in the bath. I dont care what method you use its impossible to keep the water from leaking, or actually pouring , out. As far as it fitting in the sink I dont know what kind of sink it would fit in , but definately not mine. So basically its useless...."
2,LA Mom of Twins,"I bought this tub after my 2 1/2 month twin boys outgrew our sink. I'm very disappointed with it since it really doesn't hold much water and it tends to leak from the bottom once the water has been in there for a short while. Also, since you can't fill it up all the way, my boys would always be getting cold and that would spoil the entire bath time experience. I got so fed up with this product that I decided to just take them into the shower with me! They love it and it's much more time effecient. All in all, I wouldn't waste the $20.00 on this. Spend a little more and maybe you can get something better."
1,It leaks!!!,"The only thing a tub is supposed to do is hold water in it. If it leaks, it's completely failing to do it's job and I read the instructions."
1,Don't waste your money,"We registered for this tub and took it back the first time we used it. Yes, it does leak even when assembled correctly. The sling didn't fit into the tub quite right either. I wouldn't put my baby in it."
4,It works,"We have this tub and it has been great. It has never leaked once. And although neither my husband nor myself are rocket scientists, we did manage to put the two pieces together with no problem. If you are having that much trouble with this tub, things are probably only going to get worse. My son did outgrow this tub by the time he was 7mos old, so we just put him in the regular bathtub and he is doing just fine."
3,Just buy the bath sling without the tub!,"I only used the tub a handful of times, but wore out the sling. When my daughter was old enough to sit on her own we bought a different tub seat. Plus, the tub doesn't fold up that much and still takes up much space."
5,I love this tub! I'm buying another one.,"After using this bathtub every night for the past 27 months, I am about to order another one for baby #2. I came across the online reviews and was very surprised to read about leaks. Ours has never leaked. I find it very easy to use, and I love its ability to adapt as your baby grows. I do recall that it required some strength to assemble the first time, but putting it together was not nearly as difficult as many other baby products. This tub is easy to fill up quickly so that you aren't spending excessive time drawing the bath rather than watching your child. Its rounded plastic is comfortable for baby. Plus, it doesn't lose water every time your child leans on it like the inflatable bath tubs do. It is just the right size for a toddler and their bath toys.If you don't think you like this tub, give it a second chance. It may work for you as a toddler tub stationed in your regular bathtub."
1,WHAT A DISASTER,"DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY ON THIS TUB. IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK.MY BABY WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THIS TUB, YOU ALSO ONLY HAVE ONE FREE HAND TO WASH THE BABY . IT ALSO LEAKS FROM THE BOTTOM"
1,Not worth buying,I bought this tub before reading the reviews...I wish I read it before because it leaked from day 1. The lock on the bottom is so hard to push down. It is even hard to slide it together for storage. My daughter pooped while taking a bath and the water leaked. I dont recommend this for purchase.
2,Does what it needs to,"This tub is mediocre - the suction cups on the bottom are terrible. They are very, very difficult to un-attach from whatever you set them on. There have been many occasions where water has gone EVERYWHERE from trying to yank the tub up.Also, if your baby tends to kick a lot, make sure you remove the blue plastic thing on the end. My daughter got quite a few scratches and bruises from it.All in all, it did what it needed to for the first 6 months. I doubt I will save this for my next baby, though!"
3,Mediocre tub,"At first I carried the tub into the nursery to bathe my son and it worked great for a while, but the first time I tried to carry it to the bathroom (rather than my husband) to empty it out it leaked all over and I had a mess to clean. Since then I have used it in the bathtub (with a bad back this is difficult). My son is only 3 months old and already he is getting almost too long to use it (of course he is a rather large 3-month old). For the time being he is doing OK in it, he likes to splash around. I think when he get old enough to just lay down in it I will have to invest in a new tub. The sitting position might be good, but it will definitely need a non-skid seat (which I'll have to add on)."
1,This product Sucks!1,I've used this product since my son was born. The first 4 months it worked alright. THe last few times I've used it it leaked all over my floor luckly my mom was here to take care of the baby while I dealt with all the water on the floor. I would not recommend this product at all if I could I would rate it a - 10.
1,DANGEROUS FOR BABY,"If you use this tub I URGE you to know the risk. While tub was half full of water our very young daughter was kicking and pushing her feet out. She somehow managed to push one leg UNDER the bottom moveable latch and her leg became stuck as she screamed and we tried to fight to get all the pressure off and her tiny leg out! (All the water was made it heavy to lift and remove her leg without tipping her over)My husband threw it in the garbage and I called the ""SAFTEY 1ST"" company to warn them of this serious risk. They seemed to stand by their bath and didn't care one bit! I was shocked...I think they should be pulled from the market."
1,not even worth one star,"I have to agree with the vast majority regarding this tub. IT LEAKS! I bought the 1st tub & it leaked, so I took it back thinking I got a defective one.So I exchanged the tub & used it that night on my 3-month old. I took it in his bedroom because I had it nice & warm for him & filled it up - maybe a mistake on my part, but when you buy something you have faith it will work the way it's supposed to.Well, it leaked all over his carpet. I told my husband about it & asked him to make sure it was clicked into place - I thought maybe I wasn't strong enough to get it where it needed to be. He put it in the bathtub & said it didn't leak for him.So, I used it this morning again on the kitchen counter & it leaked again! The tub is ok if you're just filling the 1st 1/2 of it where the plug is, but if it goes over to the 2nd 1/2 it leaks. (And who wouldn't fill both parts up? That would be very cold for your little tot.)DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
4,Safer than other tubs,"I bought this without reading the reviews. The tub definately leaks a little bit, I suppose because they try to make it adjustable. Because it leaked I bought a different tub. In the end I went back to this one because it has the bath ring. I feel much better knowing the baby isn't going to slip under the water. My daughter is 9 months now and she loves this tub. What I did to resolve the leak issue was put a boot tray under it. It fits perfectly and catches any water that gets by. Great $5 fix for an otherwise terrific tub. Hope this helps."
1,NIGHTMARE - STAY CLEAR!!!,Absolutely disasterously designed product. Am taking it back to buybuybaby today. We tried to use it for the first time with our newborn. Instructions could not be more vague.Then there is an area in the middle of the bath that you have to push forward to lock. I did this and all that happened is the bath length extended. I tried many many times and had no luck in hearing a 'snap' or seeing any evidence that it had locked. In the end we tried to fill it with water and it flooded our bathroom. I tried again to 'lock' it and could not get it to work.It is a poorly designed and thought through product. The manual couldn't be more vague and less helpful to new parents.Just don't buy it and save yourself the clean up mess that we just went through.I hope this helps
2,Leaks!!!!!!!,"It was great in the beginning and easy to store out of the way. After a while, with the collapsing and putting back up the seals don't hold the water as well and it began to leak. We finally gave up when we were cramming wash cloths in the grooves to slow down the water leakage."
1,It Leaks Like Crazy,"I was very disappointed in this tub. The sling worked great in the sink but considering my son is very tall, the sink didn't last long. The first time I filled it up (on the counter, not in the tub) it caused a flood and I was holding a naked 3 month old. Not a good thing.....I don't give up easily so my husband and I decided to try it in the tub. It leaked again and again and again."
1,Not worth it,"The first time I used it, it spilled all over the bathroom floor. The two pieces didn't fit together well. I just used the top piece in the sink with that yellow bathing foam thing. The 'spray' attatchment, was a waste also."
1,"It Leaks, Leaks, Leaks","I decided to ignore the comments on leak and get this tub anywas based on the few positive comments stating that is do use properly this tub would not leak. First couple of time we used we did not get any leaks, but after using it for 1 1/2 month, I would get a leak every time we used it - no matter what I did or how well we followed directions. Its going back this week and I plan to get just a simple tub with no fuss... I recomend NOT to buy this product!"
1,More of a pain than a help!!,We received this as a shower gift in January and after 4 months it began leaking out the bottom. Last night I got so frustrated because it leaked all over the bathroom floor(we use it on our bathroom counter) I decided today to call Safety 1st and I am finally getting a new one after I send in the drain plug and suction cups. Hopefully it won't be the same one. I recommend that if you are considering this tub look for another!!!!! It will save you a lot of frustration!!
1,an excuse to mold plastic,This tub is nothing but an excuse to mold plastic. It is not water tight and difficult to collapse when not in use. I returned it within a week after purchase and just bought a plain old tub without the 4 in 1 features.
2,Other tubs must be better than this one...,"Now that my 8 month old has outgrown the newborn stage, this tub is not helpful at all. She fusses when placed into the tub in the sitting position, and she slides around. I have since bought a small inflatable baby tub and a non-slip mat and it has been much better. I wish I just bought a simple bath tub instead of trying to get one I thought would last through the stages. And by the way, it's not really a four stage tub - it really only has two positions."
4,we like the tub!!!!!,"We never had any trouble with leaking. The instructions are very clear and understandable. My son loves this tub. We have been using it since he was a newborn, and he is now 5 months old. The sling is very easy to use in both of its positions and is comfortable to him. It keeps his head far out of the water. My husband and I both love this tub!!"
4,baby nurse and mom,"I was a little concernded when I read the reviews, but, I bought the tub BEFORE i read them and thank goodness I did! If I had read the reviews first I would not have bought the tub. I love the tub and have had no problems with leaking. Yes, the tabs are hard to push down. My newborn loves the tub! Sometimes we put the sling in the sink without the tub and other times we put the infant tub in the actual tub , sometimes even with me or my husband , and we use the sprayer from the hower head and he just loves it!!"
2,Hate this tub,"We got this tub and I hate it. The sling does not work well, you have to hold the baby constantly. This tub leaks when its not attached properly. It also leaks when the baby splashes around. My baby hates being held constantly and this tub makes her bath time a chore. I had ignored the reviews on this tub and I regret it."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,This tub does not live to its expectation. Water leaked everywhere everytime. I am purchasing another tub this weekend because I am tired of cleaning up the water that leaks from this tub. The bad idea about this tub is the tabs.
1,Doesn't hold water!,"I'm not certain why there are so many glowing reviews for this product. My wife registered for this item because the 4 stage tub looked good in theory. Unfortunately, because of the collapsible design this ""bath"" tub does not hold water, it just runs out of the seam where the two sides come together. There is a foam gasket around the seam that is intended to hold the water in, but it is useless.The sling is useful for bathing an infant, and the removable ring does it's job of keeping an infant upright while learning to sit. Unfortunately, by the time our infant was ready to sit we had already replaced this piece of junk. I guess they call it Safety 1st as your kid can't drown in a dry bath tub."
1,Leaky back-breaker,"We thought we'd be resourceful and get a product that lasted our son through several stages but we would not buy this again. If you use it in the tub, loosening the suction cups is back-breaking. Also, there are tons of gaps and crevices that hold water even after you drain the tub; we have had small pools--maybe one cup of water worth--accumulate on our old, only semi-waterproof bathroom floor."
2,box & contents,"The bath station box arrived dirty and areas of it were dented. The bathtub inside had some dirt marks on the edges. The condition of the box was a little embarrassing since we were giving this as a gift. And, we should not have had to clean the dirt marks off the tub itself since it was inside the box. Since it was close to the party date and not available at a local store, we had to give the gift with our apologies."
1,Dont bother.,I registered for this and got it home and put it together. It didnt seem to fit together right. I took it back and bought a basic tub and a foam bear pad to lay her on. Much better. less $$ and easy to use.
5,"C'mon Weaklings, Just yank it apart and it locks!!","This is the perfect tub, that's it, nothing to worry about here. The sling for the baby is the best thing that I have ever seen, my preemie daughter loves getting a shower in her own personal tub. She enjoys the shower massage that we have in our bathroom and she can lay in her sling while we wash her all over. After she is all clean, we fill up the tub to let her play and she is in heaven. Don't have to worry about opening and closing the tub because all you have to do is yank the ends apart and tada it's open."
5,Love it! But here's an idea NOT in the instructions...,"We love this tub and have used it (in our big tub with no problems) since my daughter was born. Now that she's 4 months, we've found a tricky situation - she's too long to lay on the slope in the tub because she kicks and bangs her head on the other end - BUT she's not yet sitting up. The great thing is that this tub has a great solution that they don't even advertise! We just take the slope out and use it in the big tub. She loves the freedom and we love the versatility! Plus, the slope (without the tub) is an easy pack-along for trips to Grandma's house!"
1,"leaking, even when locked",I really liked this product at first. I liked the sling and the fact that it was an actual tub not like others that don't give the baby room to splash (others usually have compartments to put the soap and washcloths which usually makes the tub smaller with less room for the babies legs...some of them the babies legs are not underwater). The first week I used it it didn't leak but ever since then it has been leaking really bad. Just the other night I filled it up and by the time I quickly undressed my son it was completely empty and the tabs were locked. I do not recommend this product it is just a waste of money.
2,LOTS OF LEAKS!,"THE FIRST FEW TIMES, THIS TUB WORKED GREAT. AFTER A FEW USES IT STARTED TO LEAK. I TRIED EVERYTHING TO FIX OR ADJUST IT. I ENDED UP TRASHING IT AND BUYING ONE THAT WAS ONE SOLID PIECE.TOO MANY FEATURES MADE IT A FLOP!"
2,Very Disappointed,"I had read very good reviews about this tub in April, when I had registered for it, and no one had any leaking problems. Well now that my daughter is 5 weeks old & we have used the tub a total of 6 times I have had it leak at least 3 times! The tub has to be perfectly balanced & locked into place otherwise it leaks from the middle seam. I have a double sink which makes it very difficult to balance the tub over part of it without it leaking. The first time I used it it was in her changing room & the tub wasn't locked & there was a huge flood! I had thrown out the directions to the tub not realizing that using it would be difficult to operate! Who knew that you would need directions for a bathtub! I thought that extending the tub was for when the baby got ""older"" hence the name of the this contraption "" the tub that grows with you"" The 2 stars is for the sling that is soft & really helps to support the baby while you wash it. The tub gets a Zero star!"
1,Awful...Don't buy!!!,"Well, the other reviews may say to ""read the directions"" and you'll have no problem, but this thing is awful!! I fill the tub up and begin bathing my child, about half way through it begins leaking and it goes from a quick drip to a fountain in about a minutes time (I have watched it). The two halves of the tub don not seal properly which causes water to make its way through. It also leaks when you move it...and No, not like a bowl a cereal spills when you move it...It leaks from the seal underneath with the slightest movement. I will take this back in a heartbeat as soon as the darned receipt shows up..."
1,Very Bad Tub,"I read all of the instructions and followed them and this tub still leaked. It is a slow leak, but a leak no less. The first couple of times I used it, I thought maybe I was spilling water. But, then my husband suggested it might be the tub. We watched the next time, and it was the tub. I also could not ""break down"" the tub once I got it pulled out. My husband had to do it the first 10 times before it was lose enough for me to do (and believe me, I am not a weakling). Before using the tub, I had given it to my friend who had a baby due after me. I recently went back to work and she asked me if my bath tub leaked, because her's did. After all the money you spend on a baby, you don't want to go out and spend more on a second bath tub. So, try some other tub before you consider this one."
2,"For newborns NO WAY, for babies sitting up, YES.","I first tried the sling in the sink, and that was useless. It just wouldn't stay in place and made the entire process way more difficult than it had to be. I then tried the sling attached to the tub. This time it stayed put, however my daughter didn't. It provided very little support and she was constantly sliding down, I would pull her back up and down she would slide down again. By the end of the bath her entire backside was red. I then purchased a new tub. But now that she is sitting up, I am back to this one, using it with the ring. I am much happier with it now, plenty of room for her to play without having to fill the big tub. I have no problems with it leaking. I take it in and out of the big tub everyday and have yet to have any problems."
2,it was returned to the store!,"I read the directions- it doesn't work it still leaked- defeats the purpose of not having to fill up the regular tub! Overall it's a good size and if it didn't leak would have been great. But that was not the case, so it is now back at the store. My opinion, not worth the purchase, unless you plan on never moving it from where you have it so you don't have to readjustit and keep it level."
1,DON'T BUY!,This tub is impossible to snap together and it leaks everywhere. I would try to bathe my daughter on the kitchen counter in it and water would just pour out of the bottom everywhere. Now I have to put it inside our bath tub to use it and by the time i'm done bathing her the tub has no more water. I wish I had read the reviews before I put it on my registry. WASTE OF MONEY!
2,The best thing is the insert!!,"I listed this tub on my registry because it sounded really good. Something that would grow with my baby. Well it wont be doing that. The tub itself is very long. We tried long and hard to get the ""locks"" on the bottom of the tub to lock so we can fill it with water. The closet we got was one side and the other side refused to cooperate. Since it was only off by a hair we decided to try to use it anyways. Well that didnt go to well, needless to say we had Niagra Falls right in our kitchen. The only thing I liked about this tub was the sling that comes with it. After that first try the tub landed in the garbage and the sling is the only thing I am still using. Aside from the locks, water dribbles out the sides from where the tub extends. I do not recommend this product at all."
3,"Difficult to keep clean, and leaks","I bought this tub as an exchange for a duplicate gift that I had received. I have used it since birth, first on the kitchen counter and later inside the bath-tub. The first time we opened it to use, it was confusing and very hard to push the secure tabs into place on the back to avoid leaking. I never close it for storage since it is such a pain to open and close. I liked the sling and never had a problem with it. My biggest complaint is that it has so many corners and crevices that are impossible to keep clean. I think a better design would be to have more smooth surfaces to make it easier to clean, and forget the storage feature."
2,Great Multi-tub idea...but leaks!,"The multi-use feature really appealed to me, so I bought this tub! And it worked great for the first month. After that, the tub began leaking during every use, so my wife and I had to place it in our large tub. A bit inconvenient. Furthermore, in order for you to drain the tub, you have to remove the baby, since the drain plug is located at the bottom of tub. If Safety 1st redesigns it so it won't leak and it's easy to drain, then I'm sure it will be a hit with parents!"
1,Great at first but leaks over time,I used the 4 in 1 bath and at first I loved it.. The tub had plenty of room for my baby to splash around and the idea of it growing with her over time really impressed me. The tub slids together to be convient and take up less space but over time the water in the tub begins leaking out the bottom of the tub. I also found that this tub needed to be scrubbed top to bottom every day or it would start to grow mold (yuck!). I would tip it over to let it dry and still it would get little black spots within the folds. The concept is great but I would stick to a one piece model were it won't leak over time or have as many areas to gather any build up.
2,bath tub leaks,"I received this bath tub as a gift thinking it would be versatile, since it can be expand as my baby grows. It wasn't more than a month that by husband and I had been using it to bathe and it started leaking. We exchanged it for another one, and the same problem happened again. The styrofoam strip which seals the space between where the tub expands, seems to lose it's sealing capacity in a short amount of time.This tub is also difficult to get out of the bath tub. The suction cups stick too well, that you have to really pull to get the tub out of the shower. We weren't happy with this product, so I'm buying a copletely different brand of tub. It needs improvement."
1,Maybe it'll be better,I hated this tub at first. The biggest problem I had was my baby kept slowly slipping down. I was constantly having to re adjust her for her whole bath. It also leaked as you all know and she was never in enough water. Burrrr. I finally got another tub when she started to wiggle and squirm.Now my daughter is growing out of her 2nd tub and Im thinking of using this one again for the sole purpost of the ring. Im scared to set her in the big tub yet since she is so busy. Of corse I have to use it in the tub anyway because it leaks. So maybe I'll get a total of 6 months of use out of it.
1,Don't buy this tub!,"This is the worst tub ever. Within the first couple of months 3 of the 4 suction cups ripped off, leaving big holes that my husband had to caulk. It also leaks at the joint in the middle. The leaking is so bad that I have to rush through the bath trying to beat the leak. It is always a chore trying to get my daughter bathed before the water is gone."
1,VERY disappointing,"When our 5 wk old is in the sling, he slides down and the middle snap-thing at the bottom of the tub digs into his bac, also leaving bruises. Very, very poor design. Also, it doesn't even COME CLOSE to fittingin our single kitchen sink. We refuse to use it anymore. We are gong out to ge the First Years Sure Comfort Deluxe Tub this weekend. It got 4.5 stars out of 5 on amazon and two couples we know swear b it. We should've talked to them before we put this on our registry!"
2,THIS PRODUCTS NEED IMPROVEMENT,WE THOUGHT THIS WAS A GREAT ONE WHEN OUR BABY WAS BORN. BABY AND US FELT COMFORTABLE TO GET BATHED AND BATH. BUT THE GLUE BETWEEN SECTION GOT LOOSE ONLY ONE MONTH AFTER. THEY REALLY NEED THINK ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE THE FOLDING CONNECTION.
2,Great Concept but HORRIBLE to use!!!,"Well I first tried to use this tub, and as soon as I got the water and put it on top of my counter to bathe my newborn. It just started pouring all over my floor from the bottom. Both my husband and I figured we had done something wrong or had to click something in place, but after going through the instructions and several attempts this tub still leaked. We made sure the middle had clicked in place and It didnt seem to leak in the tub and the moment we would put it on the counter it would just pour, needless to say my bathroom was flooded, newborn was naked waiting to be bathed water was cold. This tub was more of a hassle than a convience!"
1,4-in-1 Nightmare,"My husband and I thought this would be wonderful for our new baby and would last him for quite some time, so we put it on our registry. This is not the case with this bathtub, the suction works a little too well, making it difficult to maneuver the tub unless it is completely empty. The locking system is not strong enough, after only two months of use, it appeared that the sides of the plastic were tearing, not to mention the amount of strength that you had to exert to collapse the thing, by pushing down on those tabs. We discovered one morning after filling up the tub to give the baby a bath that it no longer holds water; apparently the locking system just stopped locking, when we flipped it over the tabs would appear to lock but they just weren't staying in place anymore. Needless to say this tub has been dumped in the trash, if I still had the box, I would have returned it.... This isn't the best product for baby AT ALL!"
2,don't buy this one!,"We registered for this tub after having it recommended by a salesclerk...we had a small apt at the time and needed to conserve space. This tub was a bomb - it was very difficult to get opened securely and then, what a PAIN to pry off the counter and drain. DON'T BUY IT!! The only saving grace was the sling, at least I got some good out of that by using it in our kitchen sink (well scrubbed) to give our baby a bath until we were able to get a new tub...a one piece, for $12.99 and was SO MUCH BETTER than this one. Please do yourself a favor and get a simple model."
1,Tub LEAKS!!,"We received this tub as a shower gift and started using it after our son's cord fell off. It worked GREAT for the first few months, but recently it has started to leak, and leak BAD! I fill it up with water, take my son's diaper off and get him to the bathroom, only to find that the tub is already almost empty. VERY disappointing.Also, the sling does NOT lock into place. It doesn't fit where it's supposed to. My son also slides down the sling all the time.My husband put the tub together and did it EXACTLY as it said to do, so the reviewer who said that it doesn't leak if you put it together right is wrong.We went out and bought a different tub today. Hopefully, we'll have better luck with the new one."
2,Waste of Money,"This tub is not worth your money. The tub is extremely hard to collapse for storage. Also, it is nearly impossible to keep water in it. (even with the locking tabs in place!) My daughter is six months old and uses the sitting ring, in this position it is very difficult to properly clean her. Also, she constantly slides down (normally she sits unassisted)and looks uncomfortable.The one item that is useful is the sling. It easily snaps in and out. Great for sink baths. However, you can purchase bath slings at a much cheaper price!"
1,Too many problems for a simple task!,"I recently bought this tub after my 7 month outgrew his smaller tub. It seemend like a good choice because of the compact feature-but-my husband and I struggled for hours with that thing not to make it leak! My hands were hurting by the end of the evening and it was still leaking. We followed the directions to a ""T"" and it still didn't work. Before I broke it into pieces, I returned it to Toys R Us. I've had easier times putting together desks, bookcases, etc. Everything else about the tub seemed good, but they need to improve their locking feature on this tub-it is HORRIBLE!"
2,Unwieldy,"I thought this bathtub would be the perfect solution for our small house. With only one bathroom and little storage space it looked like it would easily collapse and expand to fit in the cabinet. Even though I am a fairly strong woman I found the buttons difficult to depress and the tabs on the bottom nearly impossible. The tub will leak if the bottom tabs are not correctly pressed into place. Unless my husband is available to assemble and disassemble the bath I have to use it directly in the bathtub. Hunching over the edge of the tub is uncomfortable to say the least. When collapsed the bathtub is still a monster, taking up almost an entire cabinet in the bathroom. However, this tub is better than a non-collapsible tub for tight living areas as it is possible, if difficult, to put it away out of site."
1,I cant believe they can get away with selling this tub,"After trying for a half hour to figure out how to lock the tabs in place, we thought we had it figured out - the tub then literally gushed water all over the table. We tried to give it a chance 2 more times and it still leaked. Tried it inside the bathtub and all the water leaked out - poor baby. Do not buy this, it will only make you mad and be most unpleasant for your baby."
3,Ok tub but I will get a different one next time,The tub was a little difficult to assemble and I have just left it together.The sling was great for the first couple months but it stopped snapping into place and now it just slides around... I have to constantly move it back in place so my son doesn't slip down.I have always used the tub across my kitchen sink or in the big bath tub so I haven't had a mess but I do know that the tub will leak if the water level gets too high.My biggest complaint with the tub is because of all the parts there are many cracks that don't always dry out and can get moldy.I will never use the seat part of the tub... the underside of the plastic is a bit rough and that is the side that would be near my son's skin.The only reason I gave the tub 3 stars is because I have used it every night for 6 months and it has done the job. I will be throwing it out in another month or so when my son moves into the big tub and will get a less fussy tub for my next child.
1,Mom-To-Be Weary of this tub!,"I just received this 4-in-1 bathtub at my Baby Shower. My husband and I had not seen this tub when setting up our Registry-But we were impressed by all it said it offered...until we decided the next day to take it out of the box. The 'release buttons' were so hard to push down on to make the tub 'storage size' & I noticed they were cracked a little bit. The 'secure tabs' underneath the tub were confusing due to the diagram, but even when we did secure them, it takes a lot of tugging here and there. Finally, the sling, which seemed to be the selling point of this tub, will not SNAP into place. It sorta rests over the edge of the tub..not my idea of ""Safety 1st!"" I became frustrated with this tub after fiddling for 1/2 hour, put it back into the box and am thinking I will try to return it, even though I don't have a gift receipt :-("
2,Must read directions carefully,"First of all let me say the first time we used it, it leaked too.. HOWEVER... thats because it was not snapped togther properly. YOU MUST READ DIRECTIONS THOUGHLY before using. But on another note.. after it stopped leaking, I have found the tub to be okay for bathing (size, etc.) But tonight, I have found a major problem. The blue/green ring that can come out for older babies when put back for infant use (like the picture shows) hurt my baby tonight. He is 6 weeks and like all infants throws his hands around while laying on the sling. ( I use the sling the opposite direction so my babies head is not in the deep part of the tub) his fingers got caught under the edge of the ring... OUCH! We dont fold up for storage, because its too difficult to re-snap togther to prevent leaking. So, no, I would not recomed this product. Go simple and Soft."
2,Engineering nightmare,"70% of the time, the tub doesn't leak. The 30% that it does leak, however, is a fiasco. Here's how it happens: Once the tub is full expanded and the clips under the side are ""clicked"" into place (and yes, we did read the instructions) we fill the tub. Once we finish bathing her, we slide the entire unit forward just enough so that the drain hangs over the edge of the sink and let the water drain. It is at this point that by moving the tub, the suction cups stick to the counter and while moving the tub, it unhooks the clips and out come the waterworks....all over the hardwood floors. And let me tell you, it isn't easy to remedy this while holding a wet, squirmy baby. Mothers (and fathers) have far better things to do with their time than fiddle with the damn clips and mop up a huge mess. My husband, an MD and engineer says it is obviously incapable of maintaining a reliable seal. Look at it! Meanwhile, we're shopping for a different type of tub. We cuss too much using this one."
1,Please purchase something else,"We purchased this tub for our newborn (who is now 5 months) and from day one it was horrible. The sling is worthless. Our baby slides down the sling even at 5 months. I have not had the leaking problem, however the tub holds water between the snaps at the bottom. When you clean the tub you have to break it down completely, which is really a hassle. We have a one piece tub that is so much easier to use. I would highly recommend NOT purchasing this tub it is too much work."
2,Leaks all the time,"When starting to use this tub in earnest, we saw slow leaking because of the two-piece construction. It's not so bad if you put it in a bathtub, but on the countertop, it begins to drip water down into the cabinet drawers. Not good, but not too bad if the bath is done quickly. But leaks take their toll if the bath takes a long time or you don't clean up quickly.After pulling it apart to inspect the seal, I noticed that on one side, the seal was not aligned with the lower edge and probably this is the cause of the leak. So maybe it has to do with workmanship. I guess one piece tubs are still the way to go."
2,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!,"This tub was such a disappointment. First, it is VERY difficult to use with an infant. My daughter continued to slide down off of the sling because it did not support her. Second, it leaked after the second use. We tried placing a towel under the tub but the towel was completely soaked after about 5 minutes. By the third time the water was gushing out. Also, it is way too big to fit in your standard sinks. I think this is a waste of money and would not recommend this item to anyone. The only reason why I gave it one star is because it would not allow anything lower. I really do not feel that this tub deserves the one star. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!"
1,This bathtub sucks!,"I was very disappointed with this bath tub, I am sorry I put it on my registry... I should have picked out something better but the box made it look so wonderful-yeah right! First of all it leaks. I had a hard time figuring out how it works. The only way it wouldn't leak is if you slide it out so that the sides lock but even then some water leaks out if you don't position it right! Also like alot of other moms posted the baby slides down the sling all the time. The tub is not big enough for my 4 month old to splash around. Her feet and legs hit the sides and I am alway worried she will hurt herself. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this tub, if someones gets it for you take it back!"
2,It's just okay,"This tub is okay, but not the best there is. Our son is 3 months old and fairly long, 25 inches. He can't sit on is own yet, so has to lay on the sling. He loves to kick and splash and doesn't have the room he needs. He also slips down the sling frequently. There's got to be something better..."
1,500+ Parents HATE This Tub...,"... and I'm one of them. It's not water-tight, the plastic thing that helps them sit upright is just in the way when you're trying to put a bigger baby in it- just a total joke. We ended up putting it in a bathtub full of water so our son had someplace to sit but it's a huge waste of money, water and effort! Don't buy a product when over half the people reviewing it hated it!"
1,Leaky...,"I received this as a ""must have"" gift from my mom...Unfortunately, the first time we used it, water spilled all over my table then on to the floor. We moved the tub into my kitchen and it still leaks a little, even fully expanded...I don't notice as much leakage if there isn't a ton of water in there. However, if you have a foam support for your baby like I do, the tub requires more water for your baby to be comfortable..At which time the tub will leak a little..OK tub, but you MUST read the instruction before you fill for the first time, and I would actually buy something else."
1,Save your money!,"In theory, this is a great tub. The sling is pretty nice for infant through toddler stage. The bath ring should come in handy one day for my 8 month old. BUT, this tub leaks! I have tried and tried over again to lock it tight enough so it doesn't leak, but no amount of time spent on pulling this thing far enough will get the locks to snap into place. Now that my daughter is sitting up and getting bigger, I am going to look for a softer inflatable type tub for her to lounge in during bathtime."
1,It Leaks!,"This tub was great for the first 5 baths and then it began leaking. Since we use the tub on the kitchen counter rather than inside a bath tub, it was clear that we had a huge leak at the bottom where the parts connect."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Don't waste your money, even if you follow the directions, it still leaks. I ignored the reviews and registered for it anyway because I thought that it was cute and practical. In the beginning, we read the instructions and did not have any problems at all. My son is 5 months old now, and by the time that we finish with his bath, he's sitting in an empty tub. Take heed!!!! If not, you can't say that no one told you."
1,Leaks like crazy! Don't buy this bath,I got this at my baby shower. The only nice thing about this bath is the sling and even that is not great. My daughter still tends to slide down the sling and putting it in my sink was not an option. The bath never even held a small amount of water. Taking it out of my tub would be disasterous as it leaks like crazy. There must be a design flaw. I am going to purchase a new bath because this one IS TOTALLY AWFUL. Please take my advice and stay away from this product.
2,"Some good, some bad","Basically, once you get the back tabs to snap into place, the tub won't leak. BUT... it's getting those tabs to snap into place that's the problem. After trying and trying, I finally had to get my husband to do it, and even then, he had some gizmo to pry it together(!!!) So, since that time, two months ago, I have not taken that thing apart. So much for the convenience of folding it back together. We take a bath every night, and there's no way I want to mess with that thing daily.The concept behind the product was good, but the pulling and tugging to get it together will wear you out -- IF you ever get it assembled correctly."
1,Slippery Sling,"I registered for this tub, because I thought it would be useful for my babies for a long time. I tried using the sling while they were a few weeks old and my babies would slide down the sling and it was cold because air can circulate behind the sling. It is very difficult to snap together every time, so I did not benefit from the fact that it can be more compact. I would highly recommend buying an infant tub that has a built in support and then buying a bigger tub later. If I could return this tub I would."
2,This tub leaks all over,"This tub would be great if it didn't leak all over. I have been trying to use it on the countertop for my 10 week old, and half way through the bath, water is gushing everywhere. It is too difficult to put it in our bath tub while the baby is small, because you [hurt] your back and it is not very safe trying to lift the baby out of the bath."
1,Too Bad It Leaks,"My wife and I really liked the concept of this tub. We returned the first tub after it leaked thinking it was a fluke. Then, our second tub leaked and we returned it for a one-piece tub.I'm sorry the product did not live up to its advertising."
1,This is not a good tub,"I thought this tub would be great. My son is three months old and is already almost to long for his other tub. I saw the way this one pulled out and thought he would have more room. First of all this tub leaks from the gaps that are left when you pull it apart to use it. The little net was cool because it clipped on to the back and I thought it would keep him from slipping. Wrong again, he just slips down the net and his butt ends up off the net and in the bath tub. Then after all that it is a huge struggle to get the tub out of the bath because of the suction cups. You have to pull so hard you almost end up falling over. And to pull this tub apart and push it back together for storing is a huge deal and is not easy. And last, the plastic is so hard that when he kicks and splashes he ends up crying because he hurt himself."
1,Poor Design,"As soon as I took this out the box, I couldn't open it all the way. I had to have my husband open it and then we could close it. What is the good of having a tub that is supposed to store smaller, if you can't even close it. Very dissapointing...I returned it immediately."
1,Poor design,"Not very useful at all. It sounded cool with the ""grow with your child"" ad. But the tub itself did not seem comfortable for the baby, it leaked everywhere, and did not close and open easy. The mesh holder for a newborn was great, but you can purchase one by itself. Overall disappointment!!!"
2,LEAKS,This thing leaks on me all the time. Makes big messes all over me and the counter.. Now I just use the sling and throw the baby in the sink.. Don't even use this tub. I'll have to buy a new one..
2,Liked this tub at first.....,"I got this tub because of it's 4-in-1 features. It worked great at first but now I hate it!! It leaks, it doesn't suction to my tub and the inside edges are rough and hurt my son's skin when he rubs against them. I would not recommend this tub to anyone. Don't waste your money. I am now in search of a new tub because I can't stand using this one anymore."
1,horrible bathtub,"We had gone through three of these tubs before finally realizing that it wasn't us, it was the tub that was bad. All three times we did read the instructions carefully and tried several times to fix it with all of them. They all leaked. I would not recommend this bathtub at all."
1,Don't buy this,Our 4-in-1 bath will be picked up by the garbageman tomorrow after we had to clean up the small flood in our son's bathroom. The sling we will keep. This weekend we will buy a basic tub.
1,Leaking nightmare,"Please do not buy this bath tub! As the other reviews have said, it is a leaky mess! Even with the tabs closed it still leaks! I have to put a few towels under it so that the counter doesn't flood! I am online now to find a new one. If you have received this as a gift, as we did, return it! Hopefully Safety First will read these reviews and take this product off the shelf!"
1,Horrible Leaks,I am having the worst time with leaks. It doesnt stay latched and in the middle of the bath the whole counter becomes flooded. I am in the process of looking for a new one. But I would definetely not pick this tub!!
3,Nice but...,I have to agree with everything the other Reviers said except that we have been fortunate that we don't have leaks or had the flooding but I can see that this van happen. Our son is 16 months old and still baths in his. He got this sudden fear for the water. I have to admit that we only started to use that bath part at about 11 months. We used the insert where he can lie down from very small and never the sitting ring. I got this as a gift very early in my pregnancy so never investigated my options. Rather look at the other options as it does take up a lot of space too.
3,Great for 1st 4 months,"My husband and I thought this tub was great when we first started bathing our son in it. Once he was able to scoot around, I noticed red marks on his back. When he slides down alittle, the bar that goes around the sling diggs into his back. He can't sit up yet, so I can't put him in the seat. For the next month or so (if we don't buy a new tub before that), we'll have to keep pulling him up onto the sling. Next time around we'll be getting a different tub."
1,Pice of Junk!!!,"Like everyone else reviewing this product, I really thought this was going to be GREAT! WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! Because of the 2 seperate pices, the water just FLOODS out! We have to keep the water running into the tub while we are doing the bath, so that there is some water in there.Do NOT waste your money---I thought that because it was more expensive, it was going to be better, boy was I wrong! I am going to buy an evenflo one today!"
1,What a waist of money,I baught this tub since i did not receive one for my baby shower. It looked great in the pictures and loved the idea that it was useful for 4 stages. I have had it for a month and It has gone in the waist basket..My newborn kept slipping off the sling and I agree with everyone else with the directions on how to install the sling IT DOES NOT SNAP ON i dont know what they were talking about the sling snapping on it actually goes over the tub which makes it not safe especially for newborns. Another thing that made it a hassle was the fact that once in the tub the suction cups on it make it very hard to take the baby tub out of your own tub you have to wait untill its completly dry for you to take it out.. WHAT A WAIST OF MONEY!!!
1,Leaks!!!,"Despite proper setup (yes, I did read instructions!) this tub still slowly leaks! I have to keep adding water to it during bath. What a hassle. Definitely would not recommend."
2,this tub leaks!!!,"This tub is not that great! My friend and I both have it and the thing leaks water almost every time we use it. We have the locks set so there is no reason for it to leak. My poor 9 month old just took a bath and after 3 minutes, she was sitting in 1 inch of water! I also found the bottom of the tub to be confusing with the locking snaps. I would not recommend this tub!"
5,I love this tub -- no mildew problems for us!,"Despite the complaints of some other reviewers, I think this tub is the perfect solution for that stage where your baby is too big to be bathed in or next to the kitchen sink and too wobbly and little to use the regular tub. My daughter loves this tub. I sit it inside the regular tub when we use it, so leakage isn't an issue. I also store it in the regular tub (upside down, at a tilt) and have not experienced any mildew problems. We have a separate bathtub that is not generally used, except by my daughter, so it isn't a problem to keep her baby tub inside it. Otherwise, storage could be an issue for some."
1,"I wish I could enter ""O"" istead of 1 star...",Don't even think about buying this bath tub!!!! It leaks!!!Absolute junk!!!!
1,Very Disappointing,"We received this tub when our son was born. When we registered for it, it seemed perfect. We were very excited that it was advertised to be stored in limited space as we had a small apartment at the time. That was until we tried to assemble it.It is very difficult to put together. If it is not reassembled tightly, it leaks terribly. After my son was a couple of months old, I only used the mesh back rest in our regular bathtub and ended up bathing with him all the time.It was useless."
1,Holy Nightmare!,"I just dont know what to say about this tub. No matter how many times I read the instruction,the thing kept leaking!!! The only way to use it without making a mess was to use it in the tub. There goes my back,right after having my baby!"
4,Baby Shower Gift,I like this tub. I have a premature daughter and I used the sling at first in the sink and gave her baths on it. She is now 5 months and I have been using the tub and sling for a couple months when she got big enough for it. She stays supported fine in the tub. Her arms fall down where the sling isn't plush against the tub...that is the only problem I have with it. She hasn't hurt herself though. I think the tub is great.
1,very frustrated,"I received this tub as a gift off of my registry . For 3 1/2 months it worked great. Then it started to leak so fast all of the water poured out before I was half way through with her bath. So I tried to call the customer service line. I would get a busy signal constantly, then be on hold. Finally when I did get through they told me to disassemble the tub and mail in a few of the parts. I did this, and three weeks later no tub or follow up call. I call customer service again and get a busy signal. Again on hold for 5-10 minutes. Finally I talk to a representative and she reports the tub is on back order and I might not get it for 4 or more weeks. She offered me a credit which was less than what the tub was worth and I took it. I am going to buy another product. I would not have been so unhappy with the product, if it weren't for the poor customer service."
2,Tabs don't stay locked,"When filled, the tabs don't stay in place, but often pop out, making the tub leak all over. I bought this because I thought it would last us until our son was a toddler but now I am searching for a new and better tub."
1,It leaks...,"The tub is not hard to put together as previously stated in another review. The major problem with this product is that when you have it in the extended position, it leaks really bad. My husband and I followed the directions. Making sure that the tabs lock into place. But when you're about half way through the bath, the tabs come out of place and it leaks REALLY bad. Thank goodness we don't have carpeting in our bathroom. I have been trying to call the company to complain, but I can never get through. I don't have time to be on the phone on hold with my new little one. Word of advice, it is a great product, if it didn't leak. Once my baby gets old enough to use it in the regular tub, then it will be great. But until then, while she is still itty bitty, the product is USELESS!"
1,Don't waste your money,I bought it for my newborn and I hate it!! Even after reading the instructions it worked ok for about a week and then it started to leak. Do yourself a favor and purchase different one.
1,Don't bother with this one,Received as a shower gift. Used it without leaking 2 times... since then anytime I tried to give my son a bath the water would leak out. Bought a no name brand one for $12.99 @ Walmart and its much better and has the slide built in.Not like the mesh that with a active 3 month old will wobble.This is not a good tub. Opt for something else.Water leaks and mesh will not withstand a wiggley active baby.
2,Buy another tub,"This tub served its purpose but I will list all of my complaints with it:1. I put it together correctly and it still leaked. Not much, but enough to be a nuisance.2. The sling becomes smelly after repeated use. Also, my baby would slide down and the bar at the bottom of the sling would dig into his butt and lower back.3. The seat is slippery. When I put my son into it he slid forward and it would smoosh his baby parts.4. There are crevices in this tub that can become dirty and it is very hard to clean them.I threw the sling part out and I don't use the seat part. I just put a towel at the bottom of this tub for some traction and hold him up with my hand. I wish I would've gotten a better tub."
4,LOVE IT,"I do not normally write reviews, but after seeing all the negatives, I had to put in my pro product review:I have this bathtub and did have a problem with the base being not clicked in fully after it was empting water on my kitchen floor. But once latched in, no more problems. I used the sling with my 6lb infant and now the full tub with my 22lb 10 month old. She never had a problem with slipping on the sling, when she was learning to sit up the semi circle held her great and made her love the bath even more splish splashing around. Now we have always had this tub in our bathtub, so leaks may go undetected. But I have and would recomend this product to friends and family."
1,it leaks and i hate it,trust me i thought this looked greatit looked so convient for our small bath roomreally it leaks and is useless
4,Great station,"We received this as a gift before my son was born. Out of all the bath stations, this was the one I had placed on my register. It served use for so many stages my son would be in, and for the money, it didn't make sense to buy two or three bathing items. We have used this ever since his cord fell off. It holds enough water that my son can play and splash in it. He loves to play with his bath toys and he sits and plays in his tub for at least 20 minutes at a time.Cleaning it isn't that bad either. If it comes apart, I haven't accomplished how to do that, since the box was thrown away. I don't have anything negative to write about this item, it is easy to get in and out of the bath. It is very useful to use outside of the bathroom as well. We have even carried this with us to my parents and my in-laws for them to use to bathe him in.I would highly recommend this to anyone. GREAT product."
1,It Leaks!!,"I received this tub as a shower gift. The first time I used it, all the water leaked out of the tub. Even after checking to make sure I had clikced the latches on the underside of the tub in place, it still leaked. And every time I tried to move the tub, the side pieces the slide to make the tub larger or smaller would separate from the rest of the tub. Needless to say, I returned the tub as soon as I was able to put it back in the box. I would not recommend this tub at all."
1,Not at all what I expected!! Too much of a Hassle!!,"This is one item I didn't review before buying and now I wish I had. The tub seemed like a great deal since it could expand and grow with my son. However, it's such a hassle with the snaps on the bottom. The tub is in 2 pieces and if you don't get the seals tight enough, you will be mopping your floors afterwards! And after looking over the customer reviews since I've had so many problems with it--it appears I'm not alone with all the trouble I've experienced with this product. I suggest looking for another product! This tub follows the old saying--if it looks too good to be true--then it probably is!!"
1,Looking for a tub...,"Well I DO NOT recomend this one. This tub is awful. I agree with the lady that said LEAKS,LEAKS,LEAKS! The thrid time I used this tub I noticed it started to leak. By the time I got my baby all lathered up, there was no water left in the tub to rinse him off with. I would much rather have a one peice tub. Oh and that little net thing that you lay them on, never says locked in place, and it is already ripping on both sides. The only reason I gave this tub one star is because I didn't have a ""ZERO"" star choice."
1,Worst purchase,"This is the worst bath tub. The locking tabs do not work, so everytime I give my son a bath I am mopping up water. Do not purchase!"
3,new mom,"I got this tub as a baby shower gift, although I did have problems with the locking tabs, once my husband figured it out, it worked great. We took the suction cups off the bottom of the tub because they did make emptying it a nightmare, even though it has a drain, not all the water empties out. The tub works great for little babies but once my son reached 25 inches, we had to quit using it because he could kick the middle of it where the bath seat is and it would hurt his feet, but we just put the bath sling in the regular bath tub and it works fine, he loves to splash around in the water. I plan on using the tub again once he can sit up on his own since it has the bath ring in it."
1,Worst Tub Ever,"The tub is useless. Your child is laid so far back, they are uncomfortable. Plus, my daughter keeps sliding into the water so I have to keep moving her back up. The tub leaks all the time. The cups are so strong, after you fill it up and you want to move it to another location, good luck. It doesnt fold up well, really hard to make smaller to store. Save your money and buy another one."
1,"whatever you do, DONT BUY THIS TUB","I hated this tub right from the start. It gets mildewey and it was a pain in the neck to clean. Every time I cleaned it which was weekly, it was so hrd to clean because of its nooks and crannies and crevasses. It was also quite challening to take apart and put back together. I am getting a new one peice construction tub and i am throwing this in the trash. I called safety 1st to complain and it it blows my mind that they keep producing this awful product. have the seen the reviews?"
1,Too difficult to use,"I bought this and rushed home to see how well it worked although at the time I was still 9 mo pregnant with no baby yet to bathe. I'm so glad I didn't wait until I needed to use it because I found this tub really difficult to use. The squares you push to slide the tub bigger or smaller wouldn't budge. I tried until I was exhausted and pinched my finger in it pretty bad!Then my husband managed to get it to move (with some difficulty himself)and once we got it extened neither of us could get it back to it's smaller size. The directions weren't the problem, the tub was. I wasn't at all impressed with the newborn sling either. I ended up returning it the same day with it hanging out one end of the box since we couldn't slide it to the smaller size. Overall, I think it was clumpsy and later found one alot cheaper that my son loved and it wasn't complicated to use."
1,TERRIBLE TUB!,"This has got to be the worst tub ever. We've snapped the bottom like the instructions say, and it still leaks! Because of this, we have to keep it in the big tub. The sling isn't very good either, my son slides down it the entire time he's in the tub, so we have to keep sliding him back up. Now that he's longer, he gets red marks on his bottom from the bar of the sling. All I can say is I hope it works out better when he's able to sit on his own, because it sure doesn't work as an infant tub. I do NOT recommend this tub. Go with the ones that have the nice comfy seat in them."
2,Just awful!!!,"I recieved this 4-in-1 bath as a gift for my baby shower. I thought it was a great product, I started using it, only in the tub. It worked great only until she was able to sit up...when you turned it into the sitting part, it does not have a slip resitant, she slid all over the place, it made things so difficult!!! And cleaning, you have to take a toothbrush to it in order to clean it out well. It's hard to store away, and to dry! I would NOT recommend this product!!!"
1,It leaks all over the FLOOR!!,"I was hoping to get great use out of this tub, however I had to return it. It leaks through the seam, even when it was locked. The store I took it back to, said lots of people have this problem. Don't waste your money."
2,I don't like this tub at all,This tub stinks!!!! The sling doesn't snap in place so my daughter constantly slides down and it's very hard to clean because of the way it snaps into place. My daughter is almost four months old and I don't know why I kept it this long. I just went out and purchased another.
1,"Hard to put together, harsh plastic edges","This tub is the worst. I can not wait to return it. It is very difficult to put together, I finally had to stand on the thing to get it to snap together and now I really can not imagine how I am going to get it apart. the sling does not snap into place and the bath ring scratched up my poor son's knees. They should have some kind of foam around it! Terrible"
1,"horrible, unsafe not worth the money","This tub is terrible and it takes a lot for me to give a bad review to anything. I have literally hurt my hand trying to get the dumb thing to snap into place and it still has leaked all over my counter! I got it since it collapsed and I have limited space, but I haven't been able to collapse the thing since I set it up. My son slips down on the sling and the sling has popped out of place with him in it and even though I was right there with my hand on him, he almost fell. Also, whoever designed this thing must never have had a newborn. The sling is held together by two METAL rods. My son in just moving his head around has bonked his head on said rods resulting in him screaming in pain and my baby does not cry very often. I am very dissatisfied with this product and hope my review helps keep other parents of newborns from making the mistake I did. I am now going to get another tub.. one that doesn't leak!"
1,Ahhhh! Leaks!,"I read, reread and read again the instructions to see if I was doing anything wrong. I could get it to ""snap into place"" with minor difficulty but it STILL leaked...it is most certainly not ""cleverly designed"" as the Editorial Review suggests. Pass this one by, not worth a second thought."
2,Hard to use,I was never fond of this even with the first use. The baby sling never stayed in place and i was constantly adjusting the sling and baby. When i moved to the bath ring it's plastic edges are sharp and usually scratched him while he moved around. It doesn't colapse or open easily leaving a large tub. The only time i was happy with it was once he was old enough to sit in the full tub which is when this isn't needed.
1,Leaky,The first time we tried to use this tub it leaked all over the kitchen counter and floor. We then read the instructions again and tried again and again it leaked all over. The seal just doesn't seem strong enough where the two pieces fit together. I did like the strong suction cups though. It definitely kept the tub secure and were easy to remove using the little tabs.
1,leak and horrible,"me and my husband hated this tub. The first day we used it, i had to mop my entire floor and vaccum some part of the carpet because it leaked all over the place. I have tried my best to snap the center like they said on the mannual, but was angry since it cannot work. i always have to give my baby bath with the tub inside the bath tub. i always want to give my baby a bath over the sink since it is easier. but cant because of this stupid bath tub. In addition, when you place the ring in the center, the baby can sit without slipping but have a limited movement and cant really splash.I am in the process of calling the maker and demanding to get my money back or a new one. Will not recommend it to anyone. never!"
1,Leaky Mess,"While registering my husband and I thought that this tub would be very convenient for storage purposes. Unfortunately when opened up, it never locked into place and would leak water... everywhere. It was also not easy to disassemble. The fully formed molded tub was much much better for my son."
4,We Love This Tub!,"We love it! We started bathing our son in this tub around 2 months of age and the tub has grown with him. He is now 7 months old and loves to sit up with the middle bar in place. We think that the suction cups work great...yes, they are back breaking to release when draining the tub...but isn't it a good thing to know that your child can't slip all over the place? We also think it's great that the tub doesn't fill up all the way so that your child can't get hurt. This tub makes bath time more fun for our son and more relaxing for us knowing that he is safe!"
2,Leaky Tub,"I am a first time mom and tought this tub would do the job. The sling was very helpful in the first couple of months and it is easy to throw it in with the wash for cleaning. My complaint is that now my son is five months old and almost 20lbs and the tub leaks. It is not just a slow leak but a leak that lets all the water out by the time we are done with the bath. I am so disapointed with the tub and am going to throw it in the trash!!I am going to keep the sling, it is the only valuable part to the whole thing."
2,Leaked and a tad misleading,"This tub sounded like a good idea when I registered for it, but I realized soon after that it was not what it seemed to be. First of all, it leaked after a few months of use. We thought it was due to it not being locked properly, but we relocked it and it did no good. Secondly, it seems like you could use this tub for many stages of your baby's life, but you really can't use it for very long at all (at least not for us). The tub only works in ONE position, you can't make it smaller like it looks. And by the time your baby gets old enough to move around he doesn't want to be confined to a seat anymore. The one nice thing is the soft incline that you get with it, but the tub is so long, you have to really watch the baby and keep him/her from sliding forward and down under water. So, I really did not like this tub."
1,Can't clean dirt properly,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BATH. If you have bought the bath already look in the creases for bacteria that's growning. I didn't realize there was so much dirt and grim in my son's bath tub until I saw it floating one day and looked into all the cracks and was mortified.
1,Better off in the sink.,"This tub looks cute, but I want something that functions! The hammock type holder allows my baby to sink down too far, and it is a hassle to haul this thing around! Where are we putting this where we can use the ""convenient plug"" how come I'm just not using the sink? I want to use it on my counter top, but you know, I had better luck putting the kid in the sink with a towel. She cries her little eyes out in this thing, but laughs her head off in the sink! Don't bother just because it looks cute online."
4,"no problems, good buy","I received the bath station as a gift and have not had any problems with it. It was easy to put together and use. The first time I used it I did not pull it to the maxium extension until it clicked and I did not look at the side indicators to see if they were correctly positioned. Water went all over my kitchen counter, but it was my bad for not checking! There is plenty of room for the baby to splash and have fun."
2,Quick baths,"We purchased this bath tub, because we liked the fact that it was a four in one. The bath sling worked great for us. However after a couple of months it started leaking. Leading us to ruch through bat time before all of the water ran out. I called the manufacturer and they offered to send out a replacment right away, however two weeks later we were still without a tub. I called and they said they were on back order and they would send me a refund."
2,Not so great!,I loved this tub for a while and thought that everyone that had experienced leakage had put it together wrong. Then we started having leakage every now and then. It seems random when it leaks and we can't figure out what makes it worse at times than at others. I would rather have a tub that is all one piece.
1,Hated this!,"I DO NOT LIKE THIS TUB! The instructions are impossible to understand. It doesn't fit in a double sink. It leaks. It's too bulky and too complicated. I ended up buying a [inexpensive one] at [local store] and liked it much better. I did end up taking the bath sling as a travel bath tool for my little guy, but would not recommend registering for this tub."
3,Don't buy this product,"We followed the assembly instructions but since the first use, the water was leaking and the bath time was a hard time for me.There are so many bath tubs in the stores that are so much easy to handle than this."
2,Don't like it,"when it's not expanded, to fit in the sink, it leaks so much you can't keep water in the tub. So I expanded it and use it on top of the ocunter...if you're not careful and even one of the tabs is not in place, beware...you'll get leaks all over the counter.When we're done with the bath we slide it over the counter and let the water leak into the sink. It doesn't slide off easily so again, if you're not very careful, you'll wind up with leaks everywhere. The sling tends to get a little mildewy, even when I wash it out after a bath and let it dry. I always have to wash it again before giving him a bath and I've used up a lot of baby wash doing this. I would've selected another one."
1,tub is a wash out,"This tub started to leak the 3rd time I used it and it WAS put together properly. The mesh sling is a nice feature, although it tends to smell musty even when thoroughly rinsed after each use. The round bar is rough on the bottom and would be better if it had some sort of padding to protect baby's tender skin. The tub should also have a removable foot stop so baby doesn't just slip down the sling. Holding baby from slipping down the sling makes for a difficult bathtime."
2,Not so safe after all,"This tub was great in the beginning. It worked well when our daughter was first born. When she got around 3-4 months she started splashing and moving around and the sling would not stay in place. It is impossible to get the sling to slide/stay into place. We tried using the sitting ring but she kept sliding down and wouldn't hold a baby who can't sit on her own. This was a great tub when she couldn't move, but it is not so great once baby starts growing. I am throwing this tub away and going to buy a new one."
1,"Cleverly designed product, NOT!","We registered for this bathtub because the sales person raved about it. Well after using it, I am almost positive the sales person NEVER used it. I liked the sling but once she was old enough to be put in the tub I would need my husband there to hold her while I tired to bath her. She would constantly slide down and just seemed so uncomfortable in the tub. Also, there is a grove on the floor of the tub that she hurt her feet on. This is a bulky tub therefore not easy to store. I would recommend another product but I have not found one."
1,I HATE THIS TUB!,DO NOT BUY THIS TUB!!!! It leaks all of the water out in a matter of seconds. I am going today to buy a new one. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!
1,too much work,"I wrote a review a few months ago but I have to edit it. I followed all the directions, I was very careful and patient with this tub, I washed it and dried it after each use and still I find things growing in the crevices and between the top and bottom. The design idea was good but it just isn't practical for a baby tub that will need to be used regularly. The sling slips out of place all the time and the bath ring isn't worth the extra work it takes to clean it and the little ridges that hold it into the tub. No matter how hard I work it's impossible to keep this tub clean."
1,VERY bad purchase,"This was a really bad purchase. The sling would not ""lock"" into place on the tub as pictured and it leaked all over! I will be returning it to find a simpler tub..."
2,It does leak,"I experienced the same problem with the leaking. The very first time I used the tub I put it on my table and started to fill it. Well, it leaked all over the floor. Now I put that tub in the big tub and use it there. I do like the sling. I will purchase another tub soon."
4,Worked perfect for my premie twins!!!,"I would say that I LOVED this tub. The first time I used it, it did leak on the counter but I didn't have it fully locked in place. My girls were just at 5lbs when I brought them home and the sling it GREAT! By the time I got done using it we pretty much wore it out. The suction cups do work at little TOO good so you have to be careful when removing from tub. But over all I would give this tub 4 stars."
2,"GREAT SLING, BUT it does LEAK","I received this tub as a baby shower gift and fortunately I do use it inside of the big tub, because it does leak. I believe it has to do with the collapsable feature. It is tough to snap it together, and the plug sits under the sling so you have to remove baby and sling to get to it. Instead of fussing with all that, after bath time I unstick the suction cups and just dump it into the big tub to drain. (of course, without the baby in it) The snap together parts loosened (I assume) from using it and draining it in this manner and it's difficult and time consuming to try to get them re-snapped every bath time. It still works (half-snapped so to speak) but does leak. (The top snaps are still in place, but the underside ones aren't) I love the sling, it's removeable from the frame so it's washable. It makes hair washing easier, as the baby is reclining. In general, it's not bad, but could be better."
3,Safest tub I've found!,I have been through 3 baby tubs in 6 months. The 4 in one bath station has been the best yet. It meets the needs of an infant and a baby that is in the pre walking stages. The tub is easy to store and fits nicely in your bath tub. The only thing that I found I did not like was lack of cushioning in sitting any laying positions. My sons lower back sometimes slides down and gets a bit red. The sitting position could use some cushioning as well. His chest gets a bit red when he bends over to splash. But he has never been seriously hurt. Therefore I give the product 3 stars.
1,No good!,This tub was the worst. Every single time I went to bathe my daughter it leaked. I feel bad for the person who spent their money and bought it for me. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TUB TO KNOW ONE. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
1,Not good for 2-6 mos. olds...,"I thought this tub sounded like a great idea, but so far, I'm not too happy with it. I guess it was ok when my baby was a newborn and didn't move around much, but once she started that kicking frenzy age, she was always kicking the hard sides and bottom and sliding off the sling. The worst part is the fact that the bar on the sling is right under her bottom and leaves a red mark so I end up putting a folded towel there to protect her. I agree with the other comments about the deeper end should be where the legs go. I tried switching the side where the sling goes, but then it kept slipping and was even worse.I imagine this tub would be good once the baby can use the ring and sit up, but my baby's only 4 mos. so I haven't made it that far yet.I'm gonna go by one of those inflatable seats that float I just saw. The reviews sound great!"
1,Absolutely Terrible,"This tub is a huge mess. It leaks from both sides, and by the time you're finished giving your baby a bath, your whole bathroom gets one too. I thought it was a defect in the tub so I exchanged it for the same one. What a mistake, it leaked worst than the first. Dont waist a penny on this tub...I'm looking for another one immediately"
2,"Great concept, terrible design!","After using this tub for almost 4 months, I found that it leaks from the bottom after I pull the plug to drain it. Water was all over my counter! Also, it is not very comfortable, when I lean my baby back to rinse her hair out. Time to find another tub! Oh well."
4,not a bad product,"This item was bought for me and my husband as a baby gift from my mom. I don't use it that often because I find it easier for me to bath with my child (he is 2 mos old). I don't see how it could leak, mine doesn't. And besides, if used in a regular bathtub, you shouldn't have problem. Except if you one with sliding glass doors, that can be a pain."
1,Parent to Parent,The 4-in- one bath station is not all its put out to be! Because of the way its designed it has a problem with leaking. My baby is barely 4 months old and I already have to start shopping for a new bath tub. I hope that you read this before you go out and buy a bath tup for your baby and hopefully you won't have to go shopping again in a couple of months!!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BATH TUB!,"I recieve this tub at my shower and thought it was great.I was very scared to bathe my newborn and the sling was very helpful! But now my daughter is 4 months old and the tub DOES NOT HOLD WATER! She is just at the age that she enjoys playing in the tub and I have to refill it 4-5 times every night. I fill the tub, get her undressed, and by the time we get back to the tub it is empty.I check the tabs every night, they are in place and it still leaks. I have bought hundreds of items for my new baby and this is by far the worst purchase!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM!,"I have many complaints with this product:1. Hard to get the bottom tabs to snap into place.2. Doesn't matter if you get the tabs into place, because it still leaks and causes a flood.3. My son couldn't even play in the tub because the water leaks out too fast (5 min tops)4. Too many small crevices, you can't clean it well even with a toothbrush.5. Try calling the customer service number to complain. I did and I couldn't even get through to anyone on more than one occassion.I could go on and on. What a waste!"
1,Leaky tub,"Well, like many other people here I too have been cheated by safety 1st.Though the idea seems like a good one,it doesn't work.It worked fine for 2 months.Then it started leaking.I did assemble it properly but there is a fundamental flaw in the design.There is a layer of sponge/foam between the two layers of the tub.This layer of foam is not all that good.Since I used to collapse the tub everyday for storage purpose,it wore out and hence started leaking.new moms-don't buy this tub.It's a loser."
1,WORST TUB EVER!!!,The most annoying tub to use. The locking tabs are a nightmare to put into place and supposed to stop leaking...not always true. The tabs come undone once you move the tub resulting in a deluge of water all over the place. I would NEVER recommend this tub to anyone.
1,Hard to use,"I bought this tub as my baby was outgrowing her other one. This is very difficult to put together, nearly impossible. I could not get it together. Also, it says only to use the drain to empty it, and not to lift the tub while filled with water. This would mean you could only use it in a big bathtub. If I wanted to use the big bathtub, I would have just bought a bath ring. The instructions also say to not return to the store, to call their customer service line. When I tried to call Safety 1st, I find out that their phone has been disconnected. I am returning this tub to the store immediately, and will find one that works better."
1,This tub left my daughter with friction burn!!!,"not only did this tub leak after several times of trying to lock it, it hurt my daughter. she would slide down the net, leaving her back with a friction burn.I bought the space saving simple tub and she loves it and it doesn't hurt her.I DO NOT RECOMMEND this tub"
1,Not Happy,"I registered for this tub and regret it. The mesh sling never fit properly into the tub locks and slid around all over. This being my first baby, I was already nervous enough bathing her without the mesh sliding all over. Then there is the discomfort issue. The plastic parts and creases that stick up inside the tub seemed to leave red marks on my daughter, I can't think it was too cozy for her. I ended up using just the sling in the tub until I found a new tub. I finally found a blow up duckie tub that is the best infant tub design ever! It's all cushion and cheap. No more red marks. Although, I wouldn't recommend the blow up tub designs for newborns. If I knew what I know now, I would have just bought a mesh sling (available) and a blow up tub for later."
1,Waste of Money!!! (Would rate it 0 stars if I could),"Unfortunately, I bought this tub before I read all of the bad reviews on it. The metal frame that holds the sling rusted before my baby outgrew the newborn stage, it's very difficult to clean because of all the groves on the tub, and something somewhere on it smells like mold, but I have yet to figure out where it is coming from? I'm going out tomorrow to buy the Safe Bather by Leachco. At least that one have good reviews."
1,seriously look into a different tub!!!,I bought this tub for my son before he was born and when i started using it i realized that it doesnt hold water. I hoave to leave the tap on just to keep the tub filled. Im glad that when I bathe my son I put this leaky tub into the bath tub. I found that if you stuff a wash cloth in the bottom where the two pieces meet it hold in the water for the most part. I wish I would have researched it more. My husband and I thought it would be great so we could have our son grow into it. Boy were we wrong!!!
1,Don't waste your time or money,"The first time I attempted to use this tub my son was about 3 weeks old. The sling did not snap into place, it started floating around in the tub and he began to slip into the water. It scared me enough that I immediately took him out of the tub and gave him a sponge bath instead. Needless to say I promptly returned this tub and bought a different brand."
2,Leaks,"I could never use this outside of the bathtub as advertised because it always leaked. The only pro's were 1. the sling for the baby. I used that when my daughter was an infant in the sink and then when I would put the tub in the bathtub before she was able to sit up on her own. 2. the bar was useful when my daughter was able to sit up because she would brace her arms on it.Overall, I'm pregnant with #2 and I will not put this item on my registry."
2,Needs better support for infant,"I would not recommend using this tub until your baby has head control. When I put my newborn baby in the tub against the mesh incline he would often slide down, which caused me to try to hold him and wash him at the same time. His little face ended up too close to the water! Luckily he wasn't too squirmy, or he would have ended up right in the water. Now that he is a little older it is much easier to use. I'm anxious to try the pull out section with the seat once he can sit up by himself."
1,"worked well for a month, now it leaks","My 4 month old daughter loves this tub. She loves to splash around in it, little does she know that mom has to fill the bathroom tub up as well. If I don't her water slowly drains out the sides and bottom of the tub. The only adantage to that is I have clean water to rinse her in after soaping her up.The buttons to push for storage are impossible to use, my husband even had trouble The only reason I still use it is because my daughter likes all of the water it holds. Thik twice before buying this tub."
1,Not Worth Your Money,"I received this as a shower gift and was excited as my first child loved his bath. However, this product is disappointing. The mesh support is soft but does not help to keep your baby from sliding. The absolute worse part was that I could not use this outside of my bathtub. It leaked EVERY time. I do not recommend this to anyone."
3,Hmmmm,I found this tub to be too ... convertable? The insert for infants was Vary uncomfortable for my little one and so now he just gets in the tub with Daddy. He might have liked it later on but its not so great for infants!
1,Not worth the money,"Trust me! This tub is not worth your time and money. I will have to agree with all the reviewers, the leaking issue is a huge problem. Moreover, we have to install cushions to avoid all the discomfort to our son from the raised part in the tub. We bought this tub but would pay safety 1st to take it away."
2,useless,I received this bath tub as a shower gift. Okay so I can't look a gift horse in the mouth. Our son seemed to slip off the bath sling and never stayed comfortably positioned. It also leaked too. I tried the toddler ring when he was able to sit up unassisted but he would lean backwards. So my husband and I wound up going out and buying a bath ring.
2,Doesn't work like we thought it would,We purchased this tub for our newborn and it worked great for awhile. Then as he got older it started to leak. We would have it on the counter and the water would go all over the place. So we moved it to the bathtub and now the water runs out before my son is even done taking a bath so we keep the bath water running into it during the entire bath. I would reccommend buying one that is all one piece and doesn't snap in to place. We're disappointed because now we are going to buy another one for baby number 2 and we thought we would be using this one for all our children.
1,bad product,I don't recommend. It gave us a hard time. It is to difficult to use it and often leaks. Try to buy something better..
1,Did not work for my baby,"I register for this bath and got it as shower gift. When my daughter was 1 month old the bath was too big for her and she was not comfortable in it, noe she is 3 month and it is too small for her.NH"
2,not what i expected,"I picked this item for my registry and actually received it. at first iliked it, but then after a while all of the water would leak, A LOT! this tub seems to only be good to put inside a bath tub. and that is not what i was looking for. i don't think this was a very good tub at all. look for something better."
3,Not so great,"Well this bath was given to me as a shower gift and I thought I was going to really like it. We started using it on our kitchen counter, by the sink. BIG MISTAKE It leaked all over our counter. So I moved the tub to the bath tub so when it leaked it wouldn't get all over the place. The best part of this whole thing so far is the sling. I really like it alot. I have not used the other parts yet, since my baby is only 6 weeks old. I would not recommend this tub to anyone."
1,Another bad product from Safety 1st,"I too had a really tough time expanding this tub and would not want to collapse & extend this thing for every bath so it stays open. When open, it is too big to put in the sink and I don;t have much counter space. When carrying a full tub across the kitchen to the table, it leaks all over the floor. I have to pull the table over near the sink and use the sprayer to fill the tub. Terrible. Stick to the regular tubs that have been doing the job for years!"
1,No Zero Stars? Worst Product Ever,"If a million idiots tried their hardest for a million years to design the worst tub ever, they wouldn't even come close to designing a bigger piece of crap than this. It leaks, the infant attachment doesn't stay secure, and today it completely fell apart. It would be safer to bathe my son unattended in a raging river full of electric eels than this tub. I honestly think a five gallon bucket would be safer for your baby. Don't buy this piece of crap."
1,Not as easy as it looks,"We registered for this bath station because of its ability to ""fold up"" for storage. It is the hardest thing to do - I pinched myself so many times because it takes all of your strength to push the tabs and then it goes flying shut on your fingers.It also leaks everywhere!"
2,"Like others said, IT LEAKS!","It leaks a little but to me, that's a big thing. Who wants water on their counter and possibly (if bathing for a while) dripping onto the floor as well! I tried putting a towel under but the towel eventually gets soaked and it's a waste of a towel and a hassle. I still use mine but I put in our big tub because I do like the pad that holds baby up. That is nice. However, it's a pain to reach down inside the big tub to get to baby. It's awkward and it's a pain because I have to keep taking it in and out of the tub which isn't that bad but it's sort of a pain. Also, baby grows out very quickly of infant stage. My baby can't sit up yet but yet she's too big to lie on the pad now. Her feet are crammed, too. Need to go to next stage but simply can't. I would NOT purchase this same tub for second baby. Please don't buy. It's nothing but a hassle."
2,Baby keeps slipping down...,"I found it easy to use and it sticks to the bathtub great, BUT my two month old is constantly slipping down and I have to keep pulling him back up onto the hammock. I would buy one that is built with a slanted back and a short basin so baby doesn't have far to slide down. Maybe it will be more helpful as he is older and we don't need the hammock."
2,Started out fine but ended up leaking,"When I used our gift card for this tub I thought it was a great idea. We live in an apartment so anything that would be compact to store would be great. For awhile the tub was wonderful. But if you do not have the tub level,you bump it, or the weight of the baby (who is only 14 pounds), you end up with water leaking out. We have had several nights of taking our daughter out of the tub and starting over, besides having to clean up a mess. I am in search of a new tub and will have one by weeks end. To me having water in the tub is a BIG benefit to giving a bath."
5,Great for sitting babies!!!,"I love this tub. I think it was a great idea. This works as a wonderful transition from a baby tub to the adult tub. I bought it when my son was starting to sit, I didn't have to worry about a bath seats suctions not working and my son tipping over. Also I know it is hard to get older babies in and out of a regular bath seat without scraping knees. This bath seats clips on so I put him in the bathtub first, then just clip the seat on around him. He can sit in the tub and play with his toys keeping everything within arms reach of him. Its much better than filling an entire tub for such a little person. It does leak a little, but I just put it in our tub so it doesn't matter. This is a good idea anyway to get them used to the adult tub for when they do eventually have to use it. I am not sure I would want it for a small infant. I never used the sling/hammock thing."
3,Not for newborns,"My wife got this for our now 2 month old baby, and we had to go out and get another tub. This tub is simply not right for use with newborns because:- You cannot fit it over the sink. Newborns can't sit up on their own so it's a lot easier to bathe them in a sink so you don't have to bend over too much. With this tub you have to bathe in the tub and your back will hurt.- It has to be used in the tub because it leaks. This tub is actually made of two pieces, and no matter how good the foam is at the joint, it's bound to leak.- It doesn't have a seat for newborns, but it does come with a ""sling"" that you can put the baby on. The problem is that it's hard for baby to stay on the slide, especially they are wet and soapy. You can use the sling in the sink, but baby still slides off.I think this tub can be good for babies who are older and can sit up on their own, but I recommend investing on something else when the baby is small."
1,The worst bath tub ever!!,I got this bathtub as a baby shower gift and it looked like a good one. I did read the instructions begining to end. The tub worked fine for about a month. But then it started leaking bad all over the place. Like a new mom doesn't have enough to do with out cleaning up a flood. Anyways it just doesn't seal properly. For awhile it would only leak when you picked up the baby and it didn't have that extra weight on it. But now it leaks constiently. So now I have to go buy one of the few things I didn't have to pay for in the first place. This tub is the tub of my nightmares! Don't waste your money and time buying this worthless piece of junk.
1,Bath time is NOT fun time here!,Waste of money! This tub leaks!! I have to rush to give her a bath before the water runs out. Don't waste your money!
1,The never ending leaking bathtub,I received this item as a gift for my baby shower and just started to use it a week ago. When I filled the tub up it leaked water all over my kitchen floor. My husband finally pushed the lock thing down but it still leaked. This product is not something I urge people to purchase.
2,Impossible to keep clean,"I have used this tub for two years, but that is only because I've been too busy to figure out another solution. This tub is meant to sit within the ""real"" bathtub, so be aware of that before you buy it. Yes, it's likely to leak if you try to move it full of water, so it doesn't work well on a countertop or on the floor. The sling-type thing for use with newborns I found to work well. Likewise, the blue part for use with older babies that can sit up also worked well. But my major issue with this tub is all the cracks and crevices that are impossible to clean. Mildew thrives in them, and if you manage to take the tub apart once in awhile (a huge project), you will see disgusting gunk in the areas that don't get air. I do still like the idea of bathing my now toddler in a smaller tub within the main tub (uses less water and easier to clean, in theory), so I will be looking for a seamless very plain tub to replace this one."
2,What a waste.,"This tub is a waste of your money. The first several times we used it, we flooded our bathroom. It does not hold water in the shorter positions. The thing is supposed to grow with your child, but you have to use it fully expanded. Even then, it is a little hard to push down the center lock to hold water. The hammock thing is okay, I guess. Unfortunately, the price was right on this one, but another $10 is worth something better."
3,"Bath sling great, tub not so great","I was given this tub as a gift and the tub does indeed leak like others have written, but the SLING is great! We have been just using the bath sling in our tub since our baby was able to tub bathe and now our 4 month old still loves it! It reclines just enough to keep his head out of the water and it doesn't take a lot of water to fill the tub. It made bath time easy. The bath sling needs to be sold seperately for that purpose. No baby bathtub needed if you have this. I didn't like other baby bathtubs because it seemed to be a hassle filling the tub and emptying it everytime you give a bath. With this you can just fill the tub and drain it at the end of the bath. Simple and easy. Worth buying the tub to get the sling!"
3,It leaks!!,"My daughter is 7 1/2 months old and I have been using this tub since she was 3 weeks old. It has been fine up until recently, but I have found several problems with it:1)it leaks!! I fill the water, put my daughter in, and then the water leaks out so she is sitting in it with nothing.2)I tried to put her in the sitting section of it and it does not have any grip, so her bottom slides all around.3)When she was using the sling, I would have to put a hand cloth behind her head as the bar that holds the sling is very hard and is right under her head.I don't want to say that this tub is terrible because it has lasted this long, but the leaking is annoying."
1,Leaks!,Leaks really badly. Tried multiple times to get this thing locked but created floods each time we used it. I will be buying a different tub.
1,This Tub Sucks,This tub is ridiculous! My son is barely 4 months old and he can't even fit in it lengthwise! We can't adjust it to the sitting position though because he's not that great at balancing his upper torso. So what gives? We bought a tub that he's already outgrown (even though he's still a newborn) but can't use any of the other positions yet? What a piece of crap.
1,Junk,I had to buy a replacment the next day. It leeks! It is so much easier to use a solid tub for $10 at any store. The picture and box look great but the product is a failure.
1,Return Immediately,"As a new Mom to Be, I usually read all reviews before I buy a product. I made a big mistake buying this one before I read the reviews. I got it home and read all that was said about leaking and to make sure you read the direction...blah, blah, blah...I decided that I better try it out...what a piece of junk this thing is. The concept of the collapsing tub is great but it didn't matter how thoroughly I read the instructions, this tub still leaked like crazy! Also, trying to collapse the thing was nearly impossible. I almost gave up. Needless to say, it's being returned tomorrow to BrU. Don't waste your money!!!"
3,READ THE INSTRUCTIONS/ VIEW THE DIAGRAM,At my son's baby shower I was given a simple tub you the type sold at Walt-Mart along with a foam=like cushion... I must confess I had registered for the Safety 1st bathtub hoping to get. Well my son is now three and half months and has grown the simpler tub so I purchased the Safety 1st bathtub.... I must say that the beging I had a hard time getting to seal correctly so that the water wouldn't leak it is simply a matter of extending it completly and pressing down with your palm in the middle it even has picture in tub itself so that you don't forget.... I do agree with the sling problem byt was simply solved by hugging my son with one while bathing.... I suggest reading the instructions throughly.
2,Leaks/don't buy,"When I first got this tub I was going to return it because of the reviews. I decided to keep it and I found that most of the time it does not leak, but the few times it did I didn't realize right away and the water was all over. So now I have to bath her in this tub in the regular tub because she's still to small for the big tub!..."
1,Don't Bother!,"The tub leaks. I had read reviewers who liked the tub when I registered for it. I followed the directions and the tub still leaked. When I returned the tub to the store, the manager told me that half of them get returned. She helped me pick out another tub that we really like."
3,beware of using this out of the bathroom,"I received this bathtub at my baby shower. Its great to use and has good support for a newborn. Although if your not using it in a bathroom, it makes a mess. I used the bathtub on a table, but when you go to spill out the water, it spills all over the floor from the bottom. Its too much of a hassle, so I going to purchase a new one. You will be better off buying a tub that is one piece not two that expands and closes to get smaller and larger."
2,Just ok.,"I purchase this for my neice and she said it was just ok. This product makes alot of noise so you might want to mute it. Also, the links are design as if it is a space control panel. I would say this is a tool for childre who are beginners and non-english speakers."
1,Bad,"Just a really, really boring software. Couldn't make my daughter to spend even 10 minutes dealing with it. It' s based on MS-DOS, probably."
3,About what you expect for the price.,I bought this for my daughter and she said it was junk. We started using it together and her frustration went down but it is not great. Everytime you do something it makes noise which gets annoying. I agree with the other post that this is for non-english speakers. There are better products out there.
5,Cat poster,"Love the colors! The picture did not do it justice! It's gorgeous ! If you like color and unusual posters, this one is for you"
2,"Nice poster, but not as pictured","Nice poster, good quality for the price. The only complain is that it is different from what's advertised. The cat is the same, but all the lettering is different and the background is much brighter yellow than expected. A little bit disappointed, because I like the advertised poster better."
5,le chat qui tournee,"first saw this as part of the decor for a cafe which we use regularly when in Portugal.Wife adored it,and the poster we ordered is absolutely ideal for us.Pity that postage takes so long (and costs more than poster itself) but it was excellently packed and arrived in perfect order"
1,Not as advertised!,"First, I bought this poster from a seller called Pyramid America. They had the cheapest price on amazon and I thought I was getting a great deal. I was wrong. The poster they sent me was a completely different picture of a similar but different cat with different colors and different wording on it! -Not the same picture as advertised at all! I was shocked that they found it similar enough to substitute in place of what is pictured online. But seeing as I only paid about $3 for it I won't try to send it back for a refund, instead I'll just have to buy another one from a seller that sells what they advertise. Beware of that seller!"
2,Not what was pictured...,"When I received mine, it does not have the red border and the 'gold' color is actually yellow. But for the price, thats what I get."
2,Didn't look like the poster at all,"The product didn't look like what the poster showed at all. The actual poster I received looked much cheaper, to the point that I got another poster from a store..."
3,Nice but...,"The poster I received is not the poster in the pic. It's close, but not the same so a bit of false advertisement there."
1,This review refers to the Powered Desktop version,"A fabulous idea, and usually i adore my Belkin products, but at soon as i got it up and going, my Dell DJ 20 (gen 1) got really full of invisible files and finally completely screwed up the DJ. I got the proper driver from Musicmatch, but i made the fatal mistake of trying the docking station one more time and now i can neither open Musicmatch or access the DJ on my desktop. It took several days of different approaches to clear up the problem, including the impending wait time to get support, be it email or live chat. Again, love the concept, but although this appliance is recommended, or at least linked, by Dell, it sucks big time."
5,You might be surprised...,"...at how balanced this work is. Twiss does an admirable job of presenting a coherent and sensitive biblical viewpoint on the cultural influences on both Scripture - which he obviously holds in high regard - and our theologizing. This allows the reader to have a greater understanding of how cultural blind spots exist in our theological and religious thinking. At the same time, the author explores both the possibility and desireability of cultural awareness, sensitivity and incorporation into our theology and church's (or messianic synagogue's) life."
4,A cosy mystery set in a retirement home.,"To me, this is a new venue for mysteries and I really enjoy the fresh location. I also appreciate that the author knows that elders still can be sharp, wise and daring."
3,Predictable,"How many times have a read a book about a ""Miss Marple"" character without the fleshing out of the people? This is just another example. I got what I paid for."
3,Quick read,This is a good beach read. It's quick and does not go into all the details but has a moving plot.
4,Very fun read!,"It took me a little while to get into it, but then could hardly put it down! I proceeded to immediately purchase another of his books, which I can't wait to read!"
5,Classic Lloyd,"Anyone really interested in the great silent movie films and stars of the 20's must have this video of material finally made available. Llyod was right up there with the best (Chaplin and Keaton, among others). Included in this DVD is arguably his best full length film, ""Girl Shy."" The cinematic quality of the DVD itself is great."
4,Coaching Points From a Master,"Fritz Shurmur provides valuable coaching points on many aspects of football defense, such as personnel requirements, run and pass defense, pass coverage, nickel defenses, practice organization, and scouting information. Rather than present a specific defense, as he does with The Eagle Five-Linebacker Defense, Coach Shurmur delivers something closer to a coaching clinic featuring diagrams, player responsibilities, and coaching tips that any coach would find helpful and which can be adapted to work in any system."
5,Greatest Defensive book ever written.........,"So few things in life can ever be truly certain, but this book by the defensive coodinator of the 1996 World Champion Green Bay Packers is the #1 book ever written on defensive football......It covers EVERYTHING. Scouting the opponent, techniques, different packages, overall philosophy...It has it all. Bill Arnsparger's book WAS #1 until I read Shurmur's CLASSIC!!!!!!!! He died of cancer in 2000, but Shurmur's book on defense will be very relevent and helpful FOREVER."
4,Deep Blues,Great personal anecdotes and good overview of the development of Blues from the Delta to Chicago.
2,Dull,"I'm a big fan of the blues. I even play a little country blues on the guitar. That being said, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I have found this to be a really dull read. The book just seems to ramble along, trying to romanitize the blues instead of just giving the facts. I already understand the magic of the blues. I didn't need a book convincing me of that magic. It was also difficult to keep track of the chronology of the development of the music.The author talks a lot about African rhythm when, in fact, African rhythms have little to do with the blues. Discussions of rhythm would be more appropriate in a book about jazz. I found myself skipping ahead in hopes of finding something interesting. Alas, I did something I don't often do once I start a book--I stopped reading it."
5,Reads like a novel. Parker is a wonderful writer.,"As a student of music history for 30 years, I can say I have never read a more enlightening book, with wonderful insight and a true sense of style in every sense of the word. For the reader who wrote to Palmer c/o Rolling Stone and did not receive an answer, you should know that Robert Palmer died in 1997 at the age of 53 awaiting a liver transplant. He never got an organ. When the reader wrote to him, he was already terribly ill, hospitalized down south, and most likely could not respond. I work at the hospital in NY where he died, and I can tell you, if he could have responded, he was the kind of man who would have. We'll all miss him. Makes the plight of organ donation in this country all the more real. Consider all those who could be helped if we all took organ donation more seriously."
4,An insight into the real Delta Blues,"Robert Palmer concentrates on the Delta blues as played by the likes of Robert Johnson, Sonny Boy Williamson, Muddy Waters and many others. A good idea. Blues is such a vast thing, you could easily loose both focus and perspective if you try to put them all into the same bag.Palmer writes with a high degree of respect for the men (Bessie Smith is not an issue in this book) behind the blues, which is good. Not so good that the vicious discrimination and all that doesn't really play a part in Palmers book."
5,IN DEPTH AND WELL RESEARCHED,"I was impressed with the amount of research done to compile such a definitive list of early blues artists. I have learned about some I had previously not heard of, and was delighted to read about those I was familiar with. The author has definitely done his homework in researching the many artists included. I also enjoyed the discography included, whetting my appetite for more of this wonderful art form. An outstanding job for such a compact volume."
5,This is a training manual - excellently done.,"I have bought several of these books -- one for myself and many for family and friends. This along with the journal make a great set, in case you are interested in that as well. Everyone I have given this book too has said it was the best collection of teaching on the subject they had ever read, brought them to a clearer understanding of the scriptural background for the prophetic and the seer gift in particular, and broadened their own ability to discern the gift in others. I hope you will buy the book, it has a wealth of information and James Goll is marvelous at expounding the truth of scripture as well as very interesting to read. His experiences make for wonderful reading, and I hope you find that true when you buy and read this book. I give it a thumbs up and then some!"
5,Excellent Reference on Prophecy,This is a very powerful book on the gift of prophecy. Goll's writing has been cross-referenced with scripture throughout the book which gives creditabilty to this study. This book particularly helps those who have received the gift of prophecy giving a deeper understanding about the power of God and the purpose of visions in ministry.
5,A MUST READ!!!!,"This is the best book that I have read yet on The Prophetic or Seer Ministry and I have read many! If you want to know more about the Prophetic,Dreams,Visions,Open Heavens this book is for you. I seen almost all of the ministers that he mentions in this book and they are Powerfully Anointed men and women of God. I also seen James (Jim) Goll several times and he is definitely a seasoned prophet of God. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a more intimate relationship in ""The Secret Place"" with the Lord and desires to be used by God. This book will teach you how to live in the manifest presence of God. Be Blessed!"
2,Not ready to give my full endorsement for this book,"As and experiential Calvinist who was taught from the time I was born again in 1968 that Christianity is experiential, I am glad to see this writing discussing the spirit realm. What I don't like about this book is what I always rant on .... spiritual discernment. It isn't the author I am taking issue with at this point (I've only read a few segments of the book). What I'm taking issue with is the people he quotes. One thing is clear, the church today seems to be divided between those who throw the baby out with the bath water and won't allow any experiences and those who have experiences but no Biblical discernment to interpret their experience as from the Holy Spirit or the Counterfeit Holy Spirit, The people he quotes lie in the latter category of those who lack Biblical discernment.""lastlivingcalvinist."""
5,YOU WILL KNOW...,"This book brings a lot of insight and knowledge... It's like once you know who you are... you don't have to try to be something that you're not.And once you know what your weaknesses are... you can utilize your strengths. This book helped me understand my unique gifting and brought clarity to a lot of things I needed Insight on. If you are drawn to this book I mean something goes off in your spirit when you come across this book. Get it read it, it will bless you!"
5,"The Seer: The prophetic power of visions, dreams, and open heavens.",This is an excellent book and worthy of using as a teaching tool. Jim Goll does an excellent study on the prophetic gifts. Loved it.
4,Worked great.,These grinding wheels last much longer than the cheaper non brand name ones I have used in the past.
4,CORRECTION!,"I made an error in the review found (hopefully) above. Caballe does not hit an e-flat in the selections from ""Mefistofele"" as mentioned above. Oops!"
4,GREAT COLLECTION,"This Box Set is a great Highlight Collection of Roy Jones Career...However... Box is made from thin cardboard which rips easily, plus the cases are also low quality (one case broke in half wheni tried to open it!) so you may want to replace these..Also Bonus CD is located in one of the DVD cases with the track listing on the CD so when you put it in the Hi Fi you dont have a track listing listed any where else...apart from that, at this price you cant go wrong..."
2,Not worth it,Baught these with hopes of fixing the sag in my 88 4runner. I took them to the spring shop and they advised me not to use them due to the fact they damage the rest of your springs. This is because they are so short and put too much stress on the rest of them. I just got it done right.
1,Dick and Jane,"Spoiler Alert: This book could have been written in 20 sentences or less, but dragged on for 200+ pages. The prose isn't much better than my synopsis below. The author does not offer a new or captivating way of framing this age-old tale. It was repetitive and empty. Don't waste your time. Summary: Jane and Dick are happy. Jane is a happy daughter, wife and mother. Jane's family is perfect. Dick likes Jane. Jane likes herself. Dick works too much. Jane is unhappy. Jane meets John. Jane likes John, and John likes Jane. Jane's perfect life is on the rocks... at least in Jane's very limited own head. Jane doesn't like Jane. Jane makes friends. John goes away for a while. Jane talks to Dick. Dick likes Jane. John comes back. Jane likes Dick and John. Jane likes Jane. The end."
1,I got suckered by the reviews,"I wish I hadn't wasted my time with this book. It offered nothing new to a subject that's been written to death. Yes, extramarital affairs cause pain and have no happy resolution. No surprise there for anyone who has ever read Dear Abby or watched soap operas. At least Dear Abby used to make me laugh once in a while--this book was repetitive and depressing. The editor should have cut it by half. Some of the characters were intended to be annoying, but the most annoying was the heroine. The author's detached point of view made it impossible to have empathy for Polly, who is a holdover from the 1950s searching for a backbone. She was apparently asleep through the 1960s and 70s. Anne Tyler does this subject so much better."
4,"Oh, so this is the group that sings ""Glory Defined""","that is what I first said when I heard of this group. I had heard Glory Defined on the radio, and I became interested, and now I have found another really good band! My two favorites on this are ""Glory Defined"" and the title track, ""Space In Between Us"". This CD is also ""enhanced"" so it comes with extras. It comes with chord charts so you can play ""Glory Defined"" on your guitar and also a video of it. This CD is worth the money- I suggest buying it."
5,Brillant simplification,"I read a book on a recent flight for recreation called, A Briefer History of Time by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow. It is about quantum physics. I have huge respect for Stephen Hawking. He suffers from a terrible disease and is confined to a wheelchair and is basically a quadrapelegic yet he has a brilliant mind and a way of simplifying things that makes it easy to understand. Stephen Hawking is a physicist and an astronomer and the book deals with both physics and astronomy and the interaction of materials, planets, etc. It is a totally fascinating book and I would highly recommend it.The only thing that I did not like about the book is that it burst my bubble on Isaac Newton who he claims was not a pleasant man and his relationships with other people were very strained.It is also interesting to read about the relationship between religion and science and how tough it was on people like Galileo."
3,Underwhelmed,"While this book is shorter and more entertaining than its not-as-brief predecessor, I found it still unable to make the very esoteric subjects of space-time curvature, quantum mechanics and the behavior of sub-atomic particles understandable to me (MS Computer Science). Hawking clearly has a great sense of humor, and his effort to explain some of the results of his life's work to the general public is laudable, but this book failed to do that, at least for this reader."
4,How should we handle time?,"Reading 'A Briefer History of Time' made me reset my mind about perceiving time as we know it, or as we think we know it. This maybe sounds a little bit cryptic, but I can't put it in other words. Stephen Hawking has the ability to write extremely technical and scientific material in a manner that novel-readers can grasp and could even follow as a thriller. I can highly recommend this book to people who don't want to waste time reading!"
4,"Great book, but it's just a reprise","This book is excellent, easily read, and breaks down advanced concepts in a way that is easily digestible. But it really is the same book as ""A Brief History of Time"". If you haven't already read Brief, then get this book, but if you have, then it's a pass."
4,Modern Physics for Dummies,"Briefer isn't always better. While this treatment is much more accessible than the merely Brief version, it is disappointing by not exploring the more paradoxical and complex issues of quantum uncertainty and paired-particles.If you haven't read Hawkings before, read this book first. If you are still curious, then read the denser, ""merely brief"" version for a fuller treatment."
4,Interesting yet comprehensive for laymen ...,"I understand some of the concepts presented but was disappointed that the time wasn't taken to explain the minor details of some of the theories. What is a blackbody? The term wasn't in the glossary or fully explained in the body of the text. The example of interference was, on the other hand, too simple and explained a two-slit experiment that a 4th grader would understand. Einsten's theory of relativity is only cursorily explained."
4,Earlier version is better.,"Although I have enjoyed this updated version of his earlier book, I must say I liked the original version, A Brief History of Time, much better. I do recommend this book though to those who might not want to read the original title thinking it too complex. Stephen Hawking explains his and other theories and helps those interested in understanding the complexities of the big bang theory. I also recommend Universe in a Nutshell."
3,A good book. but the Kindle version is rife with spelling and grammatical errors,I would have enjoyed this on my Kindle if it had received a decent QA check! The errors became very distracting.
2,Very poorly edited (Kindle Ed.),"The Kindle Edition of this book has been very poorly edited, it is filled with typos and poorly formatted image captions (the captions split across pages). I wouldn't recommend the Kindle Edition of the book at its current price ($12.60 at the time of this review)."
5,Easier Version for the Non-Scientist,"Here's a new version of ""Stephen Hawking's worldwide bestseller classic, A Brief History of Time. This new version was written with Leonard Mlodinow and is titled A Briefer History of Time (Bantam Dell, 2005), and it was written to make the content of the original work more accessible to nonscientists and to bring it up-to-date with the latest scientific observations and findings. Although this book is somewhat ""briefer"" than the original, it actually expands on the great subjects of the original while leaving out some advanced technical matter (the mathematics of chaotic boundary conditions, for example!)."" (South TX Library System summary)"
2,short and basic,"this book is short and basic, not in depth, not even that good. its like the abridged version you would give to a small child so they could understand physics in laymens terms. i gave it away :("
3,Good but not great,In general the book covers big ideas to vague. For a person with a science background it leaves much to be desired with the details it discusses. A brief history of time is a much better read.
2,A dumbed-down version of A Brief History of Time,"I really liked ""A Brief History of Time"", but I was disappointed with this rehash. It is essentially the same anecdotes without the meat. I felt as though I were reading a review for children. If you have read the original, skip this one."
4,Great Read! Especially for non-physics majors.,I read this book as an extra credit option in my physics class. I was not expecting much but was well pleased. The book is written very well and is extremely intriguing and interesting. Difficult concepts are explained clearly and the visuals are great. I recommend this book to everyone. Awesome!
3,Filled the gaps of science with God,"I found that this book was easy to read and came to the subject from a different perceptive. I choose to read this book because I was hoping for a different perceptive of relativity, which I did find. If you are looking for a book to explain Relativity I would suggest ""Relativity Simply Explained"" by Martin Gardner. I did find that the last portions of the book to be harder to understand. But I would not find blame in the author, because they were new and tough subjects for me.The only problem I found in the book was that every frontier of science or unexplained scientific results, the author choose to fill the gaps with God. Throughout the whole book every topic that was explained had scientific references, but then when one thing was not fully explained with science the author would take it upon himself to explain with the use of God. I did not think that the use of God in this book was appropriate."
5,"Finally, I Almost Get It!","Amazingly Hawking and Mlodinaw discuss the concepts of energy, time, relativity, space, time travel, black holes, quantum gravity, wormholes and string theory using almost no equations, excepting Einstein's famous E=mc2. They use common sense and mundane examples to explain some of the most complex ideas ever pondered by humankind. Mlodinaw's famous humor rears its head at appropriate times, while the writing style is straightforward and easily comprehended. However, there are several sentences for which one has to go back and reread and think about before proceeding. But overall it's a fun book and leaves the layman with a rudimentary understanding of a very complex subject."
5,Facinating for a non-science oriented reader,"Since picking up Briefer History of Time, I have found myself wishing that I had a physics teacher in high school who was just a fraction of the teacher Stephen Hawking must be. As someone who has in the past had no interest in the sciences, this book has aroused my curiosity in a way I never thought would be possible. I'm already planning to read Hawking's Grand Design and Brian Green's Elegant Universe immediately after this. I now fully regret not taking more science courses in college!"
3,Only one,"For some reason I thought I would receive a set of glasses or at least a pair, but I only received one. Its pretty, but I wish I would have known bc I would have ordered at least two."
4,Know Your Spiritual Gifts,"The book is written in a very formal manner and reflects the author's beliefs concerning the ""charismatic movement"". There are some differences in delivery between American and English writers as well. The content is well organized into subject areas. I found the prayers at the end of the chapters a succinct commentary on the chapter's topic."
5,great case without the expense,"This guitar case fit my sons acoustic guitar perfectly without breaking my wallet. The inside lining was red velvet-like material and the latches, one with a lock, weren't the most expensive variety but do what there intended for. theres also a nice small compartment for picks, strings, etc. located in the neck. I measured my sons guitar to the dimensions supplied in the ad and wondered and second guessed myself alot before it arrived but I was pleasantly surprised and pleased when it came...and so was my son."
4,I like it,I plan to use it in my college curriculum.The price is good that this is a lucrative deal.It looks fine although it is a used book.
2,The CS Department dropped this one quickly,"The last 2 Intro to Programming through Java textbooks have been horrible, and this is one of them. The typos alone have caused many headaches during study and while trying to finish the work book exercises. This is a good ""flip through"" book at a bookstore, but not really worth buying to keep on your bookshelf."
3,my opinion,"this book have a simple introduction on software design by using java programming language. The content in this book is not too much for a biginner, but not really good enough for advanced study. I suggest readers to review this book in one bookstore and then decide if you wanna buy it. Maybe you would have known most of the content of the book while in the store."
4,Excellent author,"A very good overview of typography in everyday situations, as a how-to and as shown by example. Many of the examples are in a style I don't personally like (I'm a traditionalist by nature and modern typography often borders on the chaotic in my opinion) but as a designer seeing what's being done out there is a necessity. This book is more than just a typographic showcase of current thought and work - it presents sound principles that underscore what's presented."
2,Not a workbook,"I made the mistake of assumption. In light of trying to be helpful to those who are assuming the same, I should point out that:The definition of a ""workbook"" (freedictionary.com):workbook (wrkbk)n.1. A booklet containing problems and exercises that a student may work directly on the pages.2. A manual containing operating instructions, as for an appliance or machine.3. A book in which a record is kept of work proposed or accomplished.This was my assumption. This is not a workbook, nor is it a guide about how to accomplish anything. The book is a comprehensive and concise reference book inappropriate as a class text. I will say it is very interesting; and the examples are wonderful and entertaining for those who are interested in typography but not instructors....an unfortunate title for this book was chosen."
3,bring a magnifying glass,"Lots of information and examples. Unfortunately, the book is set in minute type- I'm guessing 10pt at best. You would think a book on typography would be a little more attentive to the ""readability"" of the book."
1,terrible book,"This book sucks, absolutely nothing valuable in reading this it's basically a sad attempt for a graphic designer book showing different examples of typography but the funny part is all the examples are terrible and would never be looked at in the professional world; nor do they provide any motivation for inspiration. Just another college textbook with no use."
5,Another great Pitt adventure,More action adventure with the quipster duo of Pitt and Giordino which includes a healthy supporting cast presenting yet another grand thriller. I looked forward to this one specifically as I am a fan of the Khans and enjoy reading about their exploits. Well written and enjoyable.
5,Exciting and fun!,"This is actually my first ever Cussler book and I loved it. It was fast paced, fun, upbeat, and different than anything I have previously read. His writing is smooth and the storyline is engaging and compelling. I've already started another Cussler after having finished this one."
1,Regrettable,"Clive Cussler really can write an interesting book, so this is a particularly disappointing effort. Its principal virtue is that it reads with merciful brevity, hardly surprising since the plot is twisted and improbable, the characters are shallow and familiar, and the dialogue is hackneyed and unimaginative."
5,A father and Son success,"How proud Clive must be. Having a Son that has followed in Dads footsteps and doing it properly. I always have enjoyed the Dirk Pitt novels and hope that they will continue, it seems they will for sure now. I love the way we always start back many years and build a sub plot that follows throughout the story. All and all I cannot speak more highly of the books and suggest to read them all. I have and am sincerly glad I did."
3,"Good, bad and ugly","Good: Pitt and Giordino are back. After seemingly turning over the adventures to the twins, Pitt gets back in the fray. He also seems to have lost some of the cyncical hardness he got in the middle of the series. I also like that Dirk Jr. has changed to a slightly more youthful character (he seemed to have come into the series with a hardness and coldness it took his father years of adventures to attain). The younger Pitts also seem to stay more in their realm of experience (earlier books had them doing special forces type stuff which made sense for Pitt, Sr given his military background but not for the kids). Of course there are the prologues which play into the current day dilemmasBad: Very formulaic. Pitt seems bored with marriage already.Ugly: Pitt and Giordino are getting old.Maybe the author should do some prequel type books with more adventures of the younger Pitt and Giordino."
1,Worse As An Audiobook,"I listened to this title. It was excruciating. Not because of the narrator, that's not a fair basis for a review here, but because of the pathetic, disjointed, improbable story. A story that is populated with cartoonesque characters, performing Marvel Comic feats of daring-do Captain America would blush at. The predictable bravado laced banter between Pitt and Giordano is good for a few laughs, but this sophomoric silliness has run its course."
1,The Cusslers Go Overboard,"I think you would call me a fan of Clive Cussler. After all, I think I read about everything he's written. That's why I was surprised that I had to force myself to finish this book. I think it was too much of a good thing.The Cusslers start with the usual historical setting. Ok, fine. We're all used to this. Then, shift to the '40's. Hey, what's this? Then, shift to Siberia and Dirk and friends in the present. Toss in the usual Washington D.C. crew, Julian Perlmutter, VP Sandecker (formerly Adm Sandecker), and hey, why not Dirk's kids, too, so they don't feel left out...Sorry, way over the top. I'm used to the usual formula. It works, and it's entertaining. I kept wanting to put it down, say ""I've had enough,"" but kept reading in order to see the plot resolved. Let this one alone, especially if you are new to Dirk Pitt novels."
2,Ghengis Khan was like ligtening,"This story is not like lightening, but lacks behind. Dirk Pit and Giordiono face a hoard of Mongols without weapons, without being shot to pieces. Thent they fac the Gobi Desert without proviant and tell to live about it, they are acting stupid on every turn of the story, like total imbasols, and when Dirk does not tell you about the vehicle you don't know whether is it adiside down or forward or backwards,"
2,Ho Hum...,"Having become real fanatic Cussler fan with the early books, I keep hoping that he'll regain some of the mastery. Instead, this book book, like the last few, is high on athletic action and low on plot. I kept skipping many pages of ""...and then Dirk leaps onto the Fezzomorte-386b vintage go-kart and..."". Dropped the book with 40 unread pages at the end.Darn! But hope spring eternal - maybe the next one?"
5,Another gem of a Dirk Pitt novel!,"Dirk Pitt took a slight vacation in the last book in the series, 'Black Wind,' making only what, to me, was a cameo role in an otherwise very good novel featuring mainly his long, lost children: Dirk and Summer.This time Dirk and his pal Al Giordino are back, and as good as ever, showing no signs of their older age. They're tracking a cadre of baddies this time across Mongolia, and the Gobi Desert in search of the people who they know caused a sieche wave on Lake Bakail.Reminiscent of Sahara in parts, Treasure of Khan tells another great Dirk Pitt story leading to a Clive Cussler solvation of one of history's greatest surviving mysteries: where are Ghengis Khan, and the vast fortune that he accumulated during his conquests located?A resounding winner!"
5,Loved it !!,"I chose 5 stars because I love Clive Cussler. I have read all his books over the years, except the Oregon series. He always keeps you on the edge of your seat !!!! Never lacking for action."
5,Gripping story,"Clive Cussler and son do it again. This book follows wit the same heart wrenching adrinaline pumping action involving Dirk Pitt. Although while happy that Dirk is at it again, I thought through the last few books with the revilation that dirk has two children and they seemed to be taking over the main focus and Dirk became director and they the adventurers.This is not the case with the book the Children have little more then cameo appearences in this installment. If your a hardcore Dirk Fan and was sad at seeing his role diminish as I was in the last few books you'll be excited to know Dirk and sidekick (Al) are back in full force in this book. A must read."
1,Horrible,"Don't waste your time!! The storyline of this novel was such a jumbled mess it was hard to keep track of what was going on to whom...and for what reason! Without a doubt, this was the worst Cussler novel I've read."
4,Khan Dirk continue his adventures?,"I have been reading Dirk Pitt series since the beginning. I have watched Dirk grow younger, taller, thinner, more muscular and now older, yet not wiser is his quests for adventure. A monstrous wave is created by an earthquake in the Upper Mongolian Lake Bikal, which threatens Dirk's explorations as well as destroying a petroleum research vessel (old rotted fishing boat...) Three researchers go missing, more earthquakes rock the world's petroleum ports of call, and Dirk decide's to take matters into his own hands. Soundwaves, fault lines, Genghis Khan's buriel site, more earthquakes, and an Oil company of dubious reputation all combine for this newest of Dirk Pitt installments. Goofy, yes, but I still love every bit of it."
4,its great cussler material,the book is typical cussler material with an exciting adventure and fast paced reading to never let you put down the bookthought not the best till date it definitely ranks as one of the best by cussler
2,Treasure of Khan,Not up to his usual talent. Pitt and Giordino always came out on top because the bad guys lost their ability to think when close.
5,Treasure of Khan,reading the book right now--it is SO GOOD. I enjoy all of Clive Cussler books. I wondered why if a movie has ever been made from Clive Cussler's books?
1,A disappointment,"I'm a Clive Cussler fan, so it pains me to say that this one was an awful disappointment. There was way too much description & not enough dialogue. I wound up skimming a lot of it & then lost interest in the characters & the plot. I finally gave up about halfway through. This one just didn't engage me at all."
3,Not up to expectations,"This latest Dirk Pitt adventure just isn't up to earlier works. The story could be a good one if pared down a bit, but the action just limps along and doesn't hold the reader's interest like other Cussler stories. I was disappointed in Treasure of Khan."
4,"Typical Cussler novel - exciting, yet ""far out"" on reality.",A fast moving story line that is typically Cussler. Story line background and characters well described and integrated into the story.
1,Cussler's 'Khan' corny,"My parents read a lot of Cussler & Wilbur Smith & they suggested 'Khan'. I'm finding the writing horrible & uninspired, & the dialogue hackneyed & shallow. However, I am enjoying the travel, adventure & science in the book though."
1,Find other work-Dirk,"I am a huge Clive Cussler fan- always eagerly anticipate the new novels. I even like the non-Dirk novels. This one has obviously has been written by Clive's son Dirk Cussler. Clive- you should be ashamed. You are dumping on all of us loyal readers. This is a huge disservice to all of the patrons who have made you rich. A rip off of all those fans who have financed your treasure hunts and classic auto restorations. One more of these and your fan base will vanish. Please, please- give your son a job waxing your classic cars... leave everything to him in your will... but do not subject us to anymore of his writing. If you want to quit - quit! - We will re-read your old stuff. After a few years the old stuff seems new anyway. Amazon buyers-please send Clive a message and DO NOT buy this book."
3,The Osmonds......Take Two!,"Alan Osmond's sons form The Osmonds Second Generation (or 2ndG). They are as talented and electric as thier father and uncles! Best tracks include the rockin' title track Second Generation, Can't Get Through, Lovesick,and Show Me The Way. This was released six years ago, and unfortunately doesn't showcase how much more even now these young men have matured and grown in thier talents. Since then, they have performed at the family's theater in Branson and toured with a production of Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Hopefully very soon there will be new music coming from the second wave of Osmond Brothers!"
2,No linked table of contents,"Joseph is a valuable work to have in electronic format. However, without a linked table of contents it is quite difficult to use."
5,This is added to my Kindle library as a reference book,I am pleased by how well the Kindle works with books that are kept in memory as references.
2,Disappointed!,I love watching Andre Rieu on PBS. I purchased this CD based on previous reviews. Unfortunately I didn't like any of the songs. I didn't want to spend anymore money to return it so I donated it to charity.
5,really blazing,This cd should be in the collection of any real reagee roots lover and Rasta. I love everything about this cd. I would recommend it to anyone!
4,"Another unique, offbeat Paxton movie.","Ever since ONE FALSE MOVE (which was excellent) Paxton has come up with some very interesting roles. He's the type of actor who can slip by you on how deep his talent runs. Paxton's movies always lead to such gut-wrenching violence. This one has the nail-biting climax at the end. It was a little slow in the beginning but it progressed nicely. The best line was ""you look people in the eye and lie to them but make sure you believe the lie yourself before you tell it."" Juliana Margulies did a good job in this as well. Overall it was enjoyable."
4,Well Done Flick,"I picked up this title, solely based on the cast. And they do not disappoint you. Very strong acting, and a tidy little story line, keeps this movie well paced. A great little sleeper. Bill Paxton is amazing. If you him enjoyed 'One False Move', this film takes his acting back to those days. So pick it up, and enjoy."
2,Good for little kids....,"I got this book thinking that it would help me with my front & back handspring, but the most advanced it got was teaching a cartwheel. It would be an excellent book though for some one younger and less experienced that is jsut starting with tumbling although, but not me."
2,"Well, it had ""star"" in its title!","I picked this board book as a gift mainly because it was age appropriate for the child I was giving it to and also because it had ""star"" in its title. (I like star stuff.) I think shopping online and using ""searchable"" words probably fosters that kind of behavior. Anyway, there are some really bright, colorful and charming board books out there, but this is not one of them. The artwork is plain and the colors are limited and not vibrant. We usually buy each of the nieces and nephews a book for Christmas, but I ended up going to Sam's Club and buying another board book (at a price even lower than this one, I might add!) to supplement this gift."
2,For the completists only,"This book and ""Play Hide and Seek"" have the best artwork of the Teletubbies (real art, not screen grabs from TV like so many other books).That's all it's got going for it. At only 12 pages (not 24 as stated above) and less than 50 words total, it's just inadequate for any but the tiniest tots just getting interested in books, and for those I'd recommend the smaller (cheaper) board books."
2,Not worth the money - get other ones instead,"Very few pages, and not enough variety on the ones that are present. BORING.. even to my baby- who loves the other Teletubby books."
2,Losers Inc.,"This book is about a losers inc. club that Eathen and Julios made up. he had made this club because he was a loser. When a new teacher shows up, eathen had began to win his games he play to impress her. But eathen just broken one of his rules.The three reasons why I like this book was One, eathen made a club of his own.Two,eathen almost had a girlfriend. Three,eathen broke one of his rules.The other three reasons of why did I hate this book was one,he sucked at basketball. Two,an ugly girl liked him. Three,he wears the same cloths everyday.I liked the part when hw started to win his basketball games just by trying to impres his teacher. The part of what I hated was that the girls teased him alot just because he was a loser.I would recommend the book to my cousin because he loses every game he plays."
1,A real but a boring book,"Looser made me want to never read agian.I mean it never bulid up into a story. A new teacher comes to recive hours in reading .Ethan and Julies have a stupied crush on her. They are loosers .Thats what they think .You are what you belive that you are. So Ethan and Julies form LOOSERS INC,but some events get Ethan wondering.''Am I a looser.At the end the boys find out that they are not loosers."
1,waste of time,"i relly didn't care for the book at all! I don't think it was long enough and didn't have an interesting topic. It didn't have any challange to it. To me, this book was meant for a younger age group, 11 or 12. the words weren't sophisticated enough and had a low reading level. This book talked about two charecters Ethan and Julius, and about thier science fair projects and how Ethan has a crush on his substitute teacher. To ME, this book was very stupid. And I gave it 1 out of 5 stars"
5,"Bedtime, here we come!","Going to Sleep on the Farm is an absolutely wonderful book from cover to cover. The illustrations are breathtaking and the words rhyme with simplistic beauty. It is just the thing to lure your little ones to sleep...works with my 2 year and 4 year old! Plus, the illustrations will lead you to notice subtle changes in perspective as the sun goes down... it's fun for my kids to notice those changes on each page. I happened on this book by chance, at a garage sale, but would pay top dollar for it. It would make a great gift, too!"
4,"Gritty, energetic punk rock","Don't judge a book by its cover. Despite the pathetic artwork on the outside, the Pink Lincolns put together a fine punk album on the inside. The first track, ""Lower Yourself,"" reels you in, and the rest of the songs don't disappoint. If you like crazy, high energy punk bands like AFI, Jon Cougar Consentration Camp, and Swindle, pick this album up. Now if only these Florida punk vetrans would tour to the West Coast..."
3,Candid Camera from South Africa,"I had no idea what this film was about. All I knew was that it was from Jamie Uys and I liked his other works. I ordered it.I won't say it was awful but it wasn't great either. It turned out to be a compendium of scenes from a South African show called FUNNY PEOPLE. It seems that is the South African analog of CANDID CAMERA. The gags are similar in style and the results are as well. If you liked CANDID CAMERA, you might well like this. If you aren't a fan, then you had best steer clear.There are a few funny bits but you have to sit through a lot to get to them. Its hardly worth the effort.Something else that should be noted is that this dates back to the 70's. The styles are from that era and the quality of the videography is evocative of that time as well."
2,This is FUNNY PEOPLE II,"I remembered I watch FUNNY PEOPLE on TV in the 80's, which at that time considered quite funny! Of course, with programs like American Funniest Home Video, Just For Laugh, and of the course, the Candidate Camera, this movie is considered quite lame by today standard, though some of the jokes still work!But this version released by Televista is not FUNNY PEOPLE, but the 1983 FUNNY PEOPLE II (listed at the end credit!). I realized that when Director Jamie Uys mentioned about the last movie in the opening speech. Video quality is poor with dirt and spots all over the place and color is wash off! Shimmering line could be seen at the bottom of the screen suggest that it probably source from VHS material. It is presented in full screen and super flat mono soundtrack. No Region coding.Well, still hope they will release the original 1977 FUNNY PEOPLE on DVD someday!"
2,So so...,"Not the original screened in South Africa in the 1970s-80s. This one has been dubbed with fake voice-overs to make it understandable to international audiences. Not the original (funnier) local South African accents. Some of the original footage from the first movie missing (e.g. guys struggling to get furniture through altered controls on automatic bank doors). Sound quality is rather poor, possibly due to transition from screen (film) to video/ DVD."
5,Fantastic!!,"This is perfect for anyone who is interested in cupping (these are plastic cups, not the traditional glass ones). They work great, and it comes with instructions in English for those not experienced in cupping. A definite must-have for anyone into homeopathic medicine!"
1,Lousy book,"The book is lousy. Not very helpful and too complicated for a beginner. Since I am a beginner, I don't know how good the harmonica is."
5,"A warm, enjoyable, and often funny reflection on the Bard","Jess Winfield may profess that he is not an authority on Shakespeare's works, but he sure knows them better than most people. This book is a gently thoughtful and often amusing read for anyone fond of Shakespeare or indeed, of life in general. And since the author's interpretations of Shakespeare's writings (as a guide in addressing modern problems) are by his own admission subjective, there is plenty of room for spirited discussion with friends and co-workers. A light, quick, and thought-provoking read."
2,Not quite,The book just doesn't do it for the Navy and Marine Corps Aviation Battery. Not enough examples and the Spatial Apperception section was pretty haggard.
2,Harder Than It Seems,"I used this book to study for the Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB) for the Navy OCS program. I took the test twice and I found that the math and verbal, and the mechanical reasoning parts of the test were a lot harder than the book made it seem. The spacial apperception part was pretty much right on, and the naval and aviation terms were on one test easier, and on the other a lot more difficult. I would reccommend a different book and also picking up a pilot's manual to just get an idea about aviation, because thats what the ASTB is largely geared towards."
4,The real rhythms of Carnaval,"A nice collection of recent Carnaval themes, including some by stars such as Martinho da Vila, who helped shape the modern sound of the escolas. These are all themes of recent vintage, from 1980-99, but that's hardly a liability. The sound quality is great, the melodies are rich... Sure, the rhythm gets a bit repetitive if you listen to the whole album all at once, but taken in small doses, this is pretty fab. A recommended record from a neglected style."
1,Hit Doctors is NOT karaoke,anything that is here by the name hit doctors is NOT karaoke. It is a knock off band from sound choice & in my experience not a very good one.
2,A disappointing addition to the series,"Joan Hess is always a great read, but this Claire Malloy adventure wasn't up to her normal standard. Luanne and Caron were the actual stars this time, which was lots of fun, but Claire's lackadaisical parenting and business skills were just too prominently featured for me to enjoy the plot (would China Bayles give her the time of day? A smidge of personal growth wouldn't be too out of place in this series!) -- and the ending didn't make any sense, not because of the ""who dunnit,"" but because the logistics were very questionable. Finally, not a single character mentioned the the baby to the police, even in passing? I guess I'll have to wait for the next installment to have a better ""Joan Hess fix""."
3,Just so-so,Potboiler; passes the time when there was nothing more interesting at the library. The cop boyfriend is a really cardboard character. A bunch of weird excentics. Won't check out any more. Try Ann Cranger or Deborah Crombie for a GOOD read.
1,a disappointment...,"If you're expecting photographs of ""Kauai as it was in the 1940s and '50s, this is not your book. All it contains are tiny personal photographs of a mainland haole and his family and friends, accompanied by an immature writing style. The only book I have ever returned to Amazon...Instead, check out ""Aloha, Kaua'i: A Childhood"" by Waimea Williams - no pictures but a wonderful, well-written account of a local girl growing up in the 1950s."
5,A mind-expanding read,"I was drawn to read this book by Professor Fischer's recent appearance on C-Span, and was not disappointed. It may be true as other reviewers have noted that he sometimes seems to stretch the facts to fit his theory, but I was amazed at how often as I read I said to myself, ""Yes, I knew that, but now I understand why."" Fischer's thesis can explain why the Democrats could elect a Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton but not a John Kerry, and how the red and blue states got that way. There is always a danger in stereotyping, of course, but it helps if you know where the stereotypes come from and how much of them are valid--Fischer's book is a great help in knowing ourselves."
5,Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America,"This book is a must for genealogy buffs. I found it enthralling to find out some cultural history from a different perspective. The author did a magnificent job of tracing folk ways, accents and more to let us know the ancestors from which we come."
5,Most interesting book of U.S.A. cultural origins,"A most interesting and fascinating book about the beginnings of the English colonies in America - with the impacts still being felt today. Covers everything from wealth, religion, and food to power and politics"
3,This one will take you some time to read,The insights are helping me to understand just a little bit better the reasons behind American culture and thinking processes.
5,top notch and well researched,"Albion's Seed is possibly the most influential book I have ever read. The author's assertions concerning these immigrants' impact on our culture, language, government and laws are very well supported in his footnotes and references. Although it is a long read, it is well worth the time and effort for anyone with ancestors who came to this country in one of these four waves of immigrants. It is also very worthwhile for anyone interested in the key geographic areas of early America and how they were settled."
5,"Terrific, if tedious","So as not to echo other reviewers' summaries of the content of this work, I'll just add two points: first, the Kindle version of this is a steal. Seriously. I don't believe I've seen such a favorable price differential on any other Kindle books. Second, while it is a terrific text, I don't think it is always a terrific read. It is LONG (yes, I knew this to start with, but this feels particularly long) and somewhat formulaic - e.g., look at what this segment of the American population did! How innovative! Surprise, those were traditions carried over from that region in Britain! Regardless, don't let that put you off - it takes a while to slog through, but contains a wealth of valuable information and I feel much better-versed in the history of colonial America for having read it."
1,"Overated and simplistic, relying mostly on secondary works.","Albion's Seed has met with much critical acclaim. It is, however, a simplistic book which draws outrageous conclusions based on mostly secondary evidence. The section on Quakers is particularly weak and continues the same tired and worn out ideas of Frederick Tolles' about the Quaker transatlantic community from the 1950s. Albion's Seed offers simple answers for complex questions concerning the Enlgish transatlantic community and assumes that English culture, wherever it came from, was so powerful that it overcame all barriers of time and space. Things are just not that cut and dry. Mr. Fisher's love affair with England is evident all throughout the bok but in this case it clouded his judgment severely."
1,What happened?,"Worked once... now, it doesn't do anything. Does not recharge any of the three batteries I have tried, does not even turn on it's own recharging light."
3,"Works smoothly, but smells a bit gross.","The charger is effective and a sweet product for such a good deal, but the plastic smells horrible! Especially when you are charging the battery and the plastic heats up. The charger also comes in a really cheap package, as if it came from a dollar store warehouse. Overall, as I mentioned, a steal for the price offered. Would I buy something again from the company I chose this charger from? Probably not, unless I was desperate."
1,Unusable!,"I purchased this product after hearing great reviews of pass versions. Unfortunately they decided to do a complete rewrite in ACT! 2005 and they used .NET to write the program. That has lead to a slow, bloated, piece of junk that is unusable.I installed ACT! on a Pentium 4, 1.5GHZ with 512MB of RAM and it takes close to a minute to start, that is, if it starts at all. Just opening a contact takes forever.Contact managers must be fast to be usable. If not, the customer has to wait and that is bad!"
1,Slow Slow Slow,Act! 2005 looks great but takes forever to load and is sluggish. What ever happen to writting fast software. I can open Microsoft Word and Excel at the same time and they both will open before Act! 2005 finishes getting past the spash screen. I will not use it just because I feel like I'm on a 10 year old computer using it. Terrible programming. They must have a bunch of HTML or Java programmers who never heard of compiled C. It may have great functionality but who cares if you have to wait for it to refresh a screen when I click on a menu.
1,The worst release I've experienced,"After 10 years of using ACT! and being mostly happy with one release after another from the original ACT up to and including 6.0, this was the brick wall I finally hit.My notebook is a Dell Latitude 512K RAM, 40Gig Hard drive, Pentium III processor and it couldn't handle the program. Slow, ponderous, complicated, wouldn't sychronize with my Palm T5, unresponsive service techs, what more could they do to alienate the ACT community of users?After 2 months of using ACT 7.0 (2005) I uninstalled it and reinstalled ACT 6.0..My hair is growing back in!Stay away !!"
1,Beyond Words. No Service. No Product. NO STARS!,"The overwhelming influx of profane expressions that fill my mind to describe ""BEST Software"" and the ACT! product line- still fail to even remotely convey the poor quality of this program!Absolutely mind blowing to think anyone, let alone millions, successfully manage ANYTHING with the ACT! software. Save your time, energy, & money and go elsewhere!! The opportunity cost of ACT software is running in the red."
3,Needs Work,"That first review above has got to be from Best Software. This release is far from excellent. Opening is slow, very slow. I haven't confirmed the exact memory usage, but it is a hog.The Groups are a serious disappointment. More difficult to manage as stated in a previous review. Phone formatting has a bug. Your forced to view the Expanded Menu on left side of screen.There is probably no other way, but it is time consuming to create Companies and Divisions (biggest change in this Rev.). The criteria setup to create these Companies and Division works well.It will take a few patches and revisions to get this more right. I'm going to hold onto it if the memory issues don't get any worse (I have 1 Gig of Ram)."
1,DO NOT DO IT....,"I have been using ACT2000 for so many years, and we decided to try the new version out. We run 3Ghz P4s at our shop, with HT no less, with 1gig of ram. These are very powerful machines.This program has been terrible from the beginning!We had a hard time installing, it crashes our system constantly (please understand that we use lots of software, including lots of graphic design software, using multiple programs at a time all day long, and I have never crashed any of our machines UNTIL we installed ACT2005!).It takes 3x as long to do everything it seems in ACT2005.The sync feature is very unreliable.It just stinks! This is terrible. I am moving to something else...I can't afford to lose anymore time on this product.I contacted ACT! 6 weeks after purchase...they wouldn't help me unless I purchased a $200 service plan...it's a slap in the face.Well, Sage, you are getting what you deserve: you are losing this customer...I vote with my feet and my checkbook."
1,No two way synchronization to Palm or Pocket PC yet. Beware!,"I have been a user for 10 yrs. and just upgraded. It's very slow, and the killer for me was to learn that there is no two way synchronization to your Palm or Pocket PC. That means any changes you make on the road on your PDA are NOT snyched back to your desktop. That really SUCKS! Nowadays, who carries a laptop? It will take a while for them to sort out the kinks in this version so DO NOT UPGRADE YET."
1,ACT Alternatives?,It seems to me ACT is to be avoided at all cost. I'm looking into Goldmine but don't really like it. Anyone has tried Prophet 2004 at [...] I heard it's much better than ACT.
1,good idea - bad implementation,"Act!2005 would be the best program for contact management in the world, BUT...It is extremely unstable (especially in combination with Outlook and international MS Office versions). I have to report at least 3 crashes a day, because of problems with the Outlook integration.In additions there are all sorts of little problems with editing phone fields, with the dialer (which does not understand other than US phone numbers ...), with printing calendars (which are completely wrong if you happen to use a non-standard screen resolution), etc. etc. This software is not yet ready for distribution."
1,Riddled with Bugs!,This software shouldn't be on the market yet. It should be BETA 1. Expect to visit their knoledgebase many times to get it working. The software is an extreme resource hog also. This version was a total rewrite of their previous versions - so even if you have previous experience -- STAY AWAY!
2,Why so slow?,"I have a fairly new computer and this upgrade was slow as a DOG! Tech support was hardly able to help, so even though i've been using ACT for a long time, I'm forced to dump it. Can't keep my own customers waiting for that long while I look up their records. I'd recommend looking at Maximizer or Goldmine - much better than this one!"
5,"Finally, a CM that can hold tons of info--like the big boys!","This new version is completely different than previous versions of ACT! in action and in the looks department--very cool. Before, ACT! started sputtering after 10,000-15,000 records. Now with 2005, it's a walk in the park (we have > 50,000). Like all new releases, we've had some issues with it, but our reasons to upgrade outweighed the wait for Best Software's next update. Highly recommend."
2,ACT! Mistakes,"ACT! 2005 is supposed to be a better product than the previous versions. I reviewed a copy and was disappointed by the slow speed, removal of previous features, noncompability with act-on products, and more pointing and clicking to get to the same place. Out of pain, I decided to give Outlook 2003 a try. It's much better except that it doesn't come close to ACT in terms of sales management. After doing some search on the Internet, I found an Outlook plugin (Prophet2004.biz) that works great. I hope ACT! will realize their mistakes and get it to work as well as Outlook (in terms of speed and ease of use) while keeping the sales management power intact."
1,Version cannot be used.,"I got the complete software and books, but the software cannot be activated since it was already registered once. Don't waste your money."
1,Software to stay away from,"I too upgraded from ACT 6 to ACT 2005. After installing the software and waiting for the conversion to finalize on my database I too had slow boot-up times as well as extremely sub-par performance from the program. After contacting Tech Support and waiting 1 hour to talk to someone I was told that they are seeing this sub-par performance on all installs of ACT 2005 and that the reason is because of the new SQL MSDE database that they are using. I asked about a patch and was told that they are working on a patch but they did not have any timeline for the patch to be delivered. I am sorry but a program that needs a patch to increase system performance right out of the box never should have left the Beta test version. Hope that no-one else makes this same mistake. Stay with ACT 6.0 or go with another vendor, I am returning ACT 2005 today."
1,ZERO stars,"Zero stars isn't an option but it should be.After hours getting the *%%^#@@*& program to install, I went to convert my old data bases. Only to discover that only the most basic fields would convert without major consternation. Since I had completely customized my previous ACT I went looking for help - which by the way was no where to be found in ACT's new user guide which I spent extra $$ for. When I read all of the challenges here I have decided to go back to my 6.0 ACT version.Thanks for saving me days of time trying to get this program to function even as well as my old one does."
1,slowest software ever written,"Don't buy this. The performance is treacle like. Even on a brand-new machine, it is hopeless. A great time and money-waster."
1,What a mistake!,"I am a long time Act user and after enjoying last version (6.0) I was extremely dissapointed with the bad performance of the new version.I spent two weeks on the phone with the technicians and if you are patient, Best Software has great employees that take ownership and do the best they can. Unfortunately, the technicians can't overcome products limitations:1. RAM HUNGRY. I had 512 MB and upgrated to 1 GB and still is slow.2. Does not link with Palm OS. I was promissed several times that ""it's comming"". Not delivered. They have a new ""link"" that performs extremely poorly.3. If you use Earthlink and have Total Access installed on your computer (for your safety), Act will not be able to send emails through Outlook.I am so upset that I will delete this software from my computer and go back to Act 6.0 which was great. Unfortunately Best Software will not pay me for the expense of the software and my time."
2,Wish I had read these reviews before buying....,"Although I have not had as many of the nightmare like problems that many of the reviewers have had, this software has definitely HURT rather than improved my productivity.Also, if your are using Franklin Covey's PlanPlus for Outlook, ACT will not talk properly to MS Outlook (at least I haven't been able to get it to do it after untold hours of beating my head against it and repeated calls to ACT techsupport.)I deeply regret not coming here first and reading these reviews before wasting my time (far more valuable than the money I wasted) with this sad excuse for software.As someone who has extensively studied user interface, software and web usability, I find it very difficult to believe that they invested any time or money into usability testing or even simply surveying current and potential users to determine their needs and requirements for an effective contact management tool."
3,ACT 2005,"The basic concept of the program deserves a 5 star rating, however, tech service is so poor and unresponsive that anyone purchasing this product is virtually on their own. They want you to purchase additional support services, but their initial response during the first 30 days is the worst I have ever experienced in the industry."
1,Pure junk..do not buy,"We were using Act 5.0.4 before ""upgrading"" to this piece of c$%p. After trying for 5 days to import 5.0.4 data into Act 2005, we just gave up and went back. Problem 1: The import process dropped fields (date fields for instance). Problem 2: you can't just delete the database using Windows explorer to start fresh. ACT still says that the database exists in that location under the deleted database's name. Problem 3: You can't just copy the folder that contains your ACT data to a removable or fixed drive for backup because the SQL server does not allow it. The only way to back it up is to first use a third party program such as CloseApp to shut down the ""sqlservr"" process and then run a backup. Problem 5 (and the biggest): Why can't it correctly import ALL fields from a previous version of the same program created by the same company?"
1,POOR SUPPORT & PROBLEMS Be very carefull,"The new version of Act can only effectively be used as an ""on-screen"" follow-up program. It's merge with MS Word is limited unlike previous versions, it cannot print labels in landscape, it does not communicate correctly with the printer printing envelopes on the left side when the blank envelope feeds on the right side. It crashes from the contact when choosing the relative Group selection. Just to name a few uncorrectable problems. It is far better to stick with Act 6.0 that worked as advertised. This program stinks, and I say that after using previous versions for over 10 years!.....BE CAREFULL the support staff ignore you and you can loose your contacts by using 7.0"
1,Slooow and Not Recommended,"I've been an on and off user of ACT! since the DOS days. Prior to purchasing ACT! 2005, I had been using ACT! 2000 (V5.0.3.423). Yes, I had my complaints with ACT! 2000, but ACT! 2005 is almost impossible to use. First of all, it is extremely slow to load, and this is on a P4 with 1GB RAM. Thank goodness for Acronis TrueImage and XP Pro's System Restore . . . I uninstalled this software within an hour of installing it! I would ""strongly"" suggest anyone contemplating the purchase of this software to reconsider. Stick with ACT! 2000, or even Version 6."
1,Goes back 4 generations!,"I've only written one other review of ANY product in my life. This ACT 2005 is horrific. I actually couldn't believe a new release could be so much worse than the previous version. Dilbert really lives! Can't sync from PDA to ACT. It's hog on memory. Customized layout from previous version doesn't carry-over.Yes, it really is THAT bad."
1,"Slow, sloppy & ??slippery??","Another reviewer speaks of taking a minute & a half to load on an old machine. My 2+Gig with 500Mb RAM is also sloooow to load. I was upgrading (?) from v5, which is no great shakes, either, but I stuck with it because the Goldmine reviews were underwhelming. Some of the features that didn't work at all in V5 now work, but not properly (such as field names and sub-groups). On the other hand, importing from DB5 required that I use V5 then V7. V7 simply refused to import the data. That is as far as I have had time to push to now. Hope not too many more traps await me. Especially hope the crashings do not come.Absent a major change of heart by management, I cannot imagine ever buying another edition of ACT! It is pretty good software for 1989. Trouble is, this isn't 1989. I recommend you pass on this ?upgrade? It is slow, remains sloppy to use, and the customizing screens tend to slip away before you are done making the feeble changes that are allowed. Sigh!"
1,"Redefines ""clueless""","I've used ACT 2000 with good results, and assumed (foolish me) that the 2005 version would be, oh I don't know, 5 years better. I installed it on my new Dell Dimension 4600 and waited for it to wow me. And waited. And waited. Slow is an understatement. I was sure it was something I'd done wrong, because no one could possibly ship a such a poorly designed program. ""Tech support"" is nonexistent--absurd wait times, no call backs as promised and no email response, sheer lunacy when introducing a significantly new product. Bottom line, this is a B-school textbook case of a company trying their darndest to commit product suicide. Scary."
1,Don't waste your money on this product.,"I had been a long time user of ACT since '99. Back when it was a Symantic product. I Bought Act! 2000 and had used it up until a few weeks ago. It did everything I needed it to, so I never needed to upgrade. That is until we upgraded to MS Office 2003 and the word processor stopped working with the mail merge.I wish I had read these reviews before I bought ACT! 8. It took a month for them to ship it to me. It took 3 days & numerous tries to install it, and it still doesn't run right.It's so slow It's barely usable.Want to find a contact? please wait 30 secondsWant to write a letter? another 30 seconds.Oh and I'm running a brand new Dell laptop, with lots of power.No, this program is garbage. Complete waste of money."
1,"Slow, SLow, SLOW!!!","This software essentially disabled my laptop with how slow it was. I did all the things that ACT said to do on their website (since I was on hold to customer service and decided to hang up after 1 hour on hold) to ""optimize"" my machine for Act 2005. No change. No Dialer, one way Palm sync. I am sending back to Amazon..."
1,Disaster,"A train wreck. This program is awful. I have been an ACT user for over 13 years. How could they do this? The product as sold in stores has major flaws, and when you go to update, the upgrade installation freezes. But wait, that's not all. When you call their customer support line you get connected to a salesman who insists that the only solution is for you to pay them---yes pay them $200 more to get technical advice on how to cope with this terrible product. Shame on you Best Software. This is a travesty. If you don't believe this reviewer, read the 95% of other users who agree."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"If the other reviews below aren't convincing enough, here is another. All of the issues below are real. They promised patches to deal with the speed issues and full compatability with Act for Palm by the end of February. Still nothing. Apparently the patches are eready, but they are releasing them on a ""limited basis"". They have no intention of giving another potential public release date either.If you are looking for a product to improve your productivity, this one will NOT help you. In fact, it will make you non-productive. I actually believed that they could fix this mess and stuck with it. I converted all my data and have updated hundreds of records (which if you didn't know are not reverse-compatible with older versions). So, I have now been forced to go back to pad and paper to keep up with my records. Writing notes by hand and sifting through paper is far faster than this software.Disgruntled? Yes! Will I ever buy another ACT version? Not a chance!"
2,ACT!2005 Disappoints in some areas.,"My prior version Act synched nicely with my Palm Pilot, but the newn Act!2005 won't at all with my Palm. My IT officer at my office who is very good said he can't make it work and he has tried 3-4 times now as have I. He calls it a ""major time-waster"" and he found the Help line virtually impossible to get through (""this isn't the only thing I have to do, Act!2005 is a huge time drain, not time saver."") That's a huge negative for anyone wanting to take Act on the road. Also a VERY useful feature is missing. There use to be a drop down box where you ""record history"" which would store there and you could drop it down for use with other contacts. VERY helpful if you making a chain of similar calls and want to repeat the same ""history."" That feature is now gone. Major problem in my humble opinion. Disappointing.Tim Bueneman bueny@mwrinc.com 206-664-8880 Seattle"
1,Dreadful - serious waste of money and time,"If you are a user of previous versions of Act!, I reccommend you avoid this software. It will cost you far more than you pay. The new owners of Act! are difficult and unhelpful and the many many problems of the software are almost impossible to resolve. I've gone back to a previous version and written off the cost of buying Act 2005 as experience not to deal with this company again."
1,Extremely difficult to learn. I despise ACT!,Do yourself a favor and stay away from ACT! software. They should be embarrassed to sell this piece of trash.
1,Long Time ACT User,"I've been with ACT since the DOS days. It worked well for me until Version 7.I would suggest that anyone considering this product look at the number of positive posts vs. negative posts here. There is a chance you might get lucky and not have any problems, but the odds may be against you.I run a very plain Jane, single user system and have had difficulties in several areas. The last was that it arbitrarly changed the date on thousands of my history items to 11/18/2004. There are days I think Stephen King must be writing some of the code for this program."
1,"0/10 Macros, Outlook Integration, Exell Export Disaster","HiJust using ACT!7 Workgroups premium, un-installable it just refuse to install the software hu;-( ;-(!, on a workstationsOutlook integration, please forget it it killed my .PST files 3 times and disable the ACT! Macro, forget outlook integration,Export your opportunities in Excel in 1 click, just does not work.waste of time, do not buy !"
2,"Best Software is an oxymoron, in my opinion...","I downloaded the trial version of ACT! 2005 and tested it for a couple of hours. It has a very nice interface and some nice features, but boy is it slow! The program also locked up on me a number of times. It is definitely not ready for prime time. I think Best Software runs the risk of driving away many of the program's longtime users by releasing what I would characterize as ""bloatware"". I'm not going to upgrade my hardware just to be able to run the new version - and I bet a lot of ACT! users feel the same way.I'd love to find a comparable web-based contact manager that integrates with Outlook and say goodbye to Best Software for good. I just can't go along with a company that takes a good product like ACT! and totally gums it up."
1,"Best Software, Punishing Users Daily","I've been wrestling with this software for over 3 months. The much touted syncronization service is extrodinarily unreliable and finicky. Outlook integration is absolutely appalling, it consistantly crashes Outlook. Best Software has released 4 revisions since the September launch; this product is NOT a stable enterprise level product, under the best scenario it should be considered beta."
1,Rubbish- Wow I really do agree,"I downloaded the trial just becuase I couldn't believe a product could be as bad as all the reviews I've seen here.They are correct, this software is SLOWER than slow and crashed froze my system continuously since install.WOW! Did they not test this software? What the heck?AVOID this software."
1,"""Bad"" Act 2005",If you are an individual user who doesn't need the working group feature or multiple users...forget Act 2005. This is NOT an upgrade!! You can not 2-way sync from your handheld back to Act. You also loose the dialer feature and SideAct. I sent mine back. I was very mislead that this was an upgrade.
1,"If ZERO stars were an option, ACT! 2005 would get it!","I've been an ACT! user since 2.0 and have found it to be a great Customer Relations Management tool. Of course that was when Symantec owned and developed the software.This new ""upgrade"" is a giant step backward and I'm a single user. I'll be pursuing a refund. It's only taken me five days (and over 30 hours of my time) to determine this software is a waste of hard earned money. Oh, and don't even think of calling tech support unless you have a hour or more to burn on hold.Had I not been an existing customer, I would have researched the purchase before hand. Unfortunately, I fell for the advertising hype instead of doing my own research. Even a middle aged guy can learn something new (the hard way). I'll never buy a software upgrade again without researching it first. ""BEST Software"" is a joke! ACT! 6.0 is a better product."
1,What a DOG!,"I've used ACT! since before 1993 and have consistently upgraded as new releases have become available. ACT! 2005 is full of bugs and is so darn slow that it is UNUSABLE. I made a key mistake in transitioning to it immediately, losing several days of data as I made my way back to ACT! 6.Thank goodness for the 30 day return policy. I want my money back. If I'm looking to upgrade I'll either go to Goldmine or wait until ACT! is sold back to Symantec or the previous owners and they release ACT! 2007. One star is too high a rating."
1,ACT! 2005 Not worth the hassle.,"First, I love ACT.... that is ACT 2000, the version released by Symantec almost five years ago. I've been dying to switch to a decent upgrade, but ACT!'s new owners don't quite have a concept of QA. It seems that the upgrades from version 6 to the recent 2005 release never got out of beta stage. Stay away from this unless you like poor support and a buggy product. Come on Best, you've had five years to get it right...."
4,ACT! 2005,"In response to the previous reviews,I am aware that there have been certain issues with the software on first release but please do remember that alot of the initial issues have been addressed within the free update patch 7.01 available from Best Software.It is true at first the software seems to lag behind previous versions of act however it storms past them in spectacular style with what it now does for the user, the overall functionality in the program is great and it give you a more rewarding experience.I have emailed the developers of the software and they assure me that the software is under constant development and that all update patches and fixes will be available for free."

4,Wrong picture posted by a customer.,"The picture of the mics in a hard case with shockmounts and cables is not what is being sold here. The picture is of the ""Pro Pac Plus"", not the ""Microphone Pac Plus"". The shockmounts, windscreens, hard case and cables are not in the ""Microphone Pac Plus"".

3,It's OK - not great,Fabric is not as soft as I like and it is big - not easily tightened to make smaller..
5,Was a gift for a friend,"We bought two of these for a family friend at Christmas. He requested these for use on the job as a UPS driver and for working in the back yard at home. We bought him one in camo and another in black. He says he puts them in water for about five minutes and then wears them. It keeps him cool for hours! He loves these. So, I love that we gave him a useful gift that made him happy."
1,Didn't work for me :(,"I spend a lot of time outside in the heat (record-breaking heat records being set in area of Colorado). I purchased this, thinking it would keep my head cool, helping me better deal with the heat. In short, the cap doesn't stay cold, doing nothing to help keep me cool."
2,Kindle Version Only,"This book suffers from terrible layout issues. Many of the poems are actually images, not text, so they are not searchable nor can you bookmark passages. Poems are often interrupted with stanzas in the other language. It was a lazy job by the publisher and is hardly readable."
4,Movies,Ever since man began drawing and looking at pictures it must have occurred to him that they lacked the ability to reproduce realistically the most important element of human experience -- movement.
3,A Little Slow,"I watched the DVD but it did not hold my interest as much as I thought it would. The writings of Vincent were read throughout and that was fascinating but the cinematography seemed to be fragmented and although it attempted to show the countryside where Vincent lived and how this inspired him (colors, form, locals), the cut to his paintings was quick and didn't give me enough opportunity to contemplate the beauty of his pieces. I still would recommend this DVD if you just want a look inside of Vincent's mind as he unravels to a tragic end."
1,Forgettable,"I am an Art History teacher and an avid admirer of Vincent Van Gogh.This pseudo-documentary is visually uninteresting and seems more home-made than professional. The actor reading the Van Gogh letters has an irritating voice and a monotonal delivery. The score is un-musical and aimless. I am sorry, but I do not recommend this video to anyone for any reason."
4,tribute to the spirit of a great man,"Not many movies out there about Manic-Depression, or as be called it today - BiPolar Disorder. The video Mr. Jones is one, Vincent is another. Video was put together in such manner as to gain much empathy for van Gogh, struggling with a mental handicap and struggling to capture the world on canvas. The film uniquely reveals the soul of the artist. Yet another title - Vincent and Theo - worth viewing also."
5,Fine book about the death of Kennedy,"This book came my way by accident, as I thought it was a book about JFK Jr. Imagine my suprise when I end up keeping it and really end up liking it! Two very enthusiastic thumbs up from me."
5,THE SECRET SERVICE DID IT!,"I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE WORK OF VINCENT PALAMARA IN PROF. FETZER'S WORK ""MURDER IN DEALEY PLAZA""! I THINK THE BOOK AS A WHOLE IS A GREAT READ BUT ALOT OF THE OTHER WORK PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE FINE CHAPTERS BY PALAMARA. I NEVER CONSIDERED THE SECRET SERVICE A SUSPECT UNTIL NOW. IN FACT, I BELEIVE THEY KILLED JFK! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. SECOND TO VINCENT'S WORK WOULD BE THE CHAPTERS BY AGUILAR AND MANTIC."
1,Can anybody edit???,"Interesting subject matter, but horribly...horribly edited! I found it difficult to read this book because I had to stop every paragraph or so and correct a misspelling or some other error. Wait for the movie!"
1,Attempted science,"Poor, even compared to other rediculous attempts at ""science"". Organization is lacking, theory is stated as fact, and the book contains hundreds of exclamation points, enough of an indictment in itself. Save your money."
1,This Book is a Joke,"A prime example of junk science if there ever was one. For one example, just look to the ""too-tall"" woman as proof that the Zapruder film was tampered with. A woman who is clearly standing far behind a 16-foot post (according to the authors, anyway) appears to be half that height. Therefore, she must be eight feet tall, which is proof the film was altered. Did these ""researchers"" graduate from high school?"
5,Great book. Couldnt put it down or stop laughing,"One of the absolutely funniest books I have read in years. The writers have true comedic genius. Kept me laughing the whole time I read it and I'm still laughing right now. And I hear Fetzer has a new one out that is supposed to be just as hilarious.As a caveat, I have to admit some readers might not like the idea of a serious subject such as a presidential assassination being treated with levity, but for those like myself who appreciate black and/or gallows humor, this book is a must."
1,short on verifiable facts,"Poorly written, fragmented and unverifiable. Full of wild speculation. Such a conspiracy would have had to involve hundreds, if not thousands of people--none of whom have come forward to claim the big prize of fortune and fame. Put it down, take a step back and really think hard about this. It could not have happened like this."
1,Basically a Rip-Off and an Hilarious One at That,"I can't believe I got suckered into buying this book! I enjoy speculation about the assassination as much as the next guy and admit I stopped reading it after reading Posner's excellent Case Closed. Then I started reading so much criticism about his book that I thought I should reopen my mind. Well I closed it again, and this book was the cause. If you read this book, you're expected to believe the Zapruder film was faked (an especially hilarious chapter), there are brains being stolen and substituted left and right, xrays being doctored, etcetera ad nauseum. The government is incompetent at best but we're expected to believe that a conspiracy that would have to have involved dozens if not hundreds of people has been successfully kept quiet for 40 years! Yeah right! Maybe there is more to this story than Oswald being a lone nut gunman but wild card books like these don't help."
2,Murder in a Very Small Piece of Real Estate,"Another book of ""revealing insights."" Give me a break. Once again, for all you ""conspiracy buffs;"" just go to Dealey Plaza and stand in front of the stockade fence and you'll see what a small area of land it is in which you seem to find so many hidden gunmen. If I was standing fifteen feet from you and fired a high-powered rifle, wouldn't you hear the blast? See me? See me frantically running away to avoid being captured for committing the greatest murder of the century? Phantoms and ghosts, except for poor old Lee Harvey, the only gunman."
3,He missed it!!!,"If you want to know who fired the fatal shot in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963 get a copy of the Zapruder video and look at the driver of the limo as he turns and fires the fatal shot! Get other books on the Kennedy assasination that have the kill shot photo (frame 313) and look at the driver. The Secret Service was in on the plan! But they had help. There were two other gunmen in Dealey Plaza and a total of 4 shots fired at Kennedy. One was fired from the grassy knoll that wounded him in the throat and 2 of them were fired from behind the limousine, not the school book depository building, hitting Texas Governor John Connally. The 4th and fatal shot was fired by the Limousine driver. Check it out for yourself! Don't just believe me! Investigate it!"
4,Great place to start,"I was in eighth grade when we were told JFK was shot - in the temple. It wasn't until I read the Warren Commission Report five years later that I realized THEY changed history, and said he was shot in the back of the head. While I've read a bookcase full of plots and theories this one is a great basic text. The only negative is it gets bogged in the medical.New evidence has brought to light some strange connections between the Paines (who housed Marina and Lee Harvey Oswald)and some others like CIA Cord Meyer. (whose ex wife was murdered just after the JFK assassination."
5,I am amazed at this book!,"I cannot believe just how incredibly good this book truly is. ""Murder in Dealey Plaza"" has convinced me that al those years of reading and believing paid off-there was indeed a massive conspiracy and cover-up, no doubt by the Secret Service and the government. The medical evidence was always a jigsw puzzle to me until now-no longer. Horn, Palamara, Aguilar, Mantik, White, Wood, and Fetzer all deserve congressional medals of honor for this book. I'm truly a believer!"
2,Trying too hard...,"I was very excited to delve into this book. However, once opened, I was very disappointed. With the exception of the very interesting timeline provided in the second chapter, the rest of the book is scattered, inconclusive and even confusing. Am I the only one who had trouble understanding the direction? It rambles on without getting to the point until the very end, at which point you're too exhausted to care."
2,Save your money,"Oh what a disappointment this book was for me. Please save your money for something that is better than this one. This book is very poorly written and badly in need of an editor, numerous typos, etc. throughout the book. Very bias one-sided 'reporting' includes a so-called chronology of events that is laughable for its selective use of material."
2,critical anaylis,"very detailed and complex to follow.as a college grad,i had to stuggle to digest the writing."
1,warmed over leftovers,"O.K so let's see what XTC has released in the course of the last 4 releases, 2 c.d's worth of demos of the c.d's they had just released (Apple Venus Vol. 1 and Wasp Star), the so-so Wasp Star and now this. I am thier biggest fan but my support is wavering. I don't mind the previously unavailable demos of songs that were not included on any releases (Find the Fox, Terrorism, Let's make a den) but rejected single releases and demos of thier classics or live versions of some early b-sides just don't do much for me. I guess I was looking for the original versions of early songs (Dance Band, Hang Onto the Night, Heatwave) not this. I guess the vault has pretty much been emptied now though. I expected so much more than this. Hopefully when thier old c.d.'s are re-released (White Music in particular) I can get some of the original early classics, not live version medleys or demos. This is truly for only the most maniacal fans."
4,Continued Lime success,Once again Lime delivered a great CD. I already owned some of the music contained on this production but it is great to hear various versions and the music together on one CD. I have loved Lime's music since my college days in the 80's and wish they were together making music today. Their music brings back a lot of happiness and good times and of course with a beat all their own!
2,From Venus,It is a class C movie that actually should be a class D. I was an EXTRA in the movie so I bought it to see myself. The movie is real wierd and hard to follow.
2,Dont let the cover photo fool you... NO NUDITY,Some lingerie throughout the movie but no sex or nudity. Waste of money. The other reviews that are connected are for a multi-movie pack.
1,such a waste,this movie is such an unworthy purchase. The acting and the concept were elementary school fantasy type with poor follow through.
2,not bad enough,"some movies can be kistch or soo bad that they're funny, sadly this one is neither. if this is a movie excercise i had to give them a D-, and Im being really soft. not worth renting...sorry"
1,Very poor to look at,"This DVD collection is probably the worst of them all, picture quality is way too poor for DVD format, it was very grainy and dark in viewing. I wouldn't have to comment on the content."
5,Fascinating Premise,"This may be my all time favorite book. This book starts out with two men meeting that instictively hate one another, and goes on in the exploration of why from there. 4 characters cross each other lifetime after lifetime in multiple forms. From past lives to a soul catching machine to the future, this book is creative and very well written."
5,An excellent book for beginners,"I read the first edition of this book many years ago, when I had first began learning of Thelema, ceremonial magick, and the OTO. I had not studied a lot of Western occult tradition before this, and was in need of a beginners book that could get me up to the point where I could share and learn from the people I was associating with at the time. This book fulfilled that need admirably. If you're an advanced student who's been practicing ceremonial magick for years, this is probably not what you're looking for, nor will it be useful if all you want to do is stoke your own ego with the thought that you are one of the chosen few who has the capacity to truly understand Thelema. However, if you're looking for an introductory book to discover some of the possibilities of ceremonial magick and Thelema, or just to find out what all this stuff is about, then I've never found a better text for that purpose."
3,Good place to start,"I am a big fan of the author in his capacity as practitioner of Thelema and magick, and as a scholar of many things. I wish he had employed those skills in producing this work.New Aeon Magick purports to be a beginner's guide. Del Campo specifically stated in his Introduction that it started life as something to pass on to his children as their guide to Thelema and magick. In this regard, it is a decent overview of some very complex matters.The treatments of some of the subjects are occasionally superficial, unfortunately. The reader looking to get an indepth discussion of these issues will need to suppliment his or her reading. To aid this, a bibliography would be worth having. Also some sourcing of his quotes and statements about the teachings of Thelema and of other magical schools would be helpful.This book would serve well as a ""table of contents"" to other, more detailed treatments of Thelema and ceremonial magick, but has trouble standing on its own."
3,Not a bad primer,"As described in the introduction, this book is intended as a primer in the philosophy of Thelema and its use of ceremonial magick and it succeeds beautifully in both these aspects. The language used is simple and easily accessible for the novice magickian. If Crowley seems at first too obscure, this may serve as a good starting point.Various aspects of Thelemic philosophy and religious belief (quabalah, gemantria, the Will, etc.) as well as various physical and spiritual practices (asanas, pranayama, etc.) are explained in brief chapters, without going into a lot of depth, but enough to get a basic grounding from which to study more serious works as suggested in a few chapters. Various rituals are described as well, such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (in Hebrew and Latin), the Star Ruby, and the Liber Resh.Not a bad primer for the curious novice or neo-pagan who'd like to learn a bit more about Thelema without going directly through Crowley."
2,OK but I still did not buy it!,I came across this book in a used bookstore and was initially going to buy it...but as I looked over it in more detail I found it to be too simplistic and not very comprehensive. The author talks about each of us finding our own way which I am all for but then he provides you with small ceremonies.
1,What the ****,"For the life of me, I dont know why people glorify actors such as Bloom. I say with conviction that he isn't a good actor and only has his looks to show (although Ive heard of his charitable works which is nice to know but it isnt enough to survive in Hollywood). It is sad that people milk Bloom for all his worth until someone comes along to snag him and his fans from the top."
3,"better production, but not as good as TBF","this mcd has a better production than the black flower full lenght cd, but they have dilute their sound at a point you couldn't say is metal anymore... and that's a bad thing for me."
2,Misleading photo,I was a little disappointed when i received my purchase. The photo shows the mitts and booties. I thought that was what i was purchasing. There isn't a drop down to choose mitts or booties or both. so i assumed i was getting what the photo showed. The product name says paraffin bath accessories- mitts parabath. So if I had really thought about it I would have questioned it. I'm not sure if it is posted like this out of laziness. Someone didn't want to take the tine to take another photo... or deception. (the mitts are nice quality... so why not just tell people in advance what they are getting. Then they would be happy with the purchase.)
5,softer hands,"I have ""trigger fingers"" and the P/T suggested that I purchase this bath to ease the pain. It works well. As for the mitts - a towel would be just as good."
5,Patterns for Needlepoint,I bought this to adapt any pattern that I could for needlepoint. So far... I have seen at least 3 patterns that can be adapted. Well worth the price of the book.
3,Gonna Have Love One More Time,"A bit schmaltzier than VOL 1, ALL-TIME GREATEST HITS VOLUME 2 continues the tracking of one of Country's true masters.""Tall Dark Stranger"" is horrible, just the kind of sugary-sweet molassas Owens fans think he is above. Luckily, that is one of the few misteps here; tunes like ""Love's Gonna Live Here,"" ""Above & Beyond,"" and ""Gonna Have Love"" are true classics."
5,SUPER DOLPHIN BOOK!!,"this book was amazing!! AMAZING I TELL YOU!! atleast thats what samar thinks..really cool samar..really cool! well if you're looking for a book about dolphins you should try this, i mean it says that you'll learn a thing or two about them..trust me i'd buy it!!! but my mom only lets me borrow books from the library.. super good, GET IT!!!"
2,CD scratched,I bought this season new and I would never to think there would be scratches on the cd. Its a scratch that kept skipping throughout the whole disc and it was disc 6. Very Disappointed.
2,Arrived a week early,"I was able to complete my collection sooner then i expected...but when it did arrive it was missing the book that comes with it and the bottom was badly bent and damaged also the plastic that holds the discs was broken, leaving me with a mess of plastic shards and no way to hold the discs..fast shipping but crappy delivery."
2,Dragonball Z Season Eight,I love the season but my 5th disc turned out to be from season 7 and not the season that I ordered. I am very up set with this. I'm trying to enjoy the movies just to find out that I'm missing several episodes. I would like yall to send me the disc that I am missing. I have plans to buy more movies as well as books for school from Amazon but now I'm considering to buying them from somewhere else. I really like Amazon because they have everything that i need at a good price but I just can't accept anything less that what you have promised.
3,Ok i guess,Ok im watching dbz everything is going good then the player is unable to read the disc it cant read the half the 2nd and third
4,This was good! Buy it!,This was really good! See DBZ at anime was like a magic time of my live!The last bad point it's not really cool to read it on a PS3! PS2 have a real difficulty with this serie! But this is all of the bad point!Good day!
5,Excellent Season 8!,"Dragon Ball Z picks up the pace yet again with season 8. This season has some of the best fighting in the entire DBZ series. Some of which I've never seen before, but only heard about when I was growing up trying to wacth this show. I have all 8 seasons and waiting for the 9th and final season to end an excellent series. I kinda get to relive some of my child hood wacthing DBZ all over again and I will keep this collection and someday share them w/my kids if there into this type of show LOL! I would mos def say this is a buy if your into DBZ"
5,dbz rewiews,it is so good that my family and I watch it together often when we are not busy . great job
3,Dragon Ball Z: Season Eight (Babidi & Majin Buu Sagas),Funimation has really impressed me with all of the of Dragon Ball Z box sets they have made. I am not impressed with the condition the discs are in from this box set. I have so far returned this box set 2 times because of defective episode discs that have scratches. I have bought all 9 box sets and this is the first season I have had trouble with.
2,Nice looking but cheaply made,"This changing table is nice looking, but VERY cheaply made. The drawers are flimsy and come off the tracks almost every time the drawer is opened. The wood is very soft and easily scratched and dented. I would not recommend this changing table."
2,Very Disappointing,"This changer looks great albeit it's not durable at all. The drawers are already falling apart! I guess you get what you pay for. I find that I don't have a place for the changing accessories like diaper caddy. When the baby is small enough, you could sneak that at the end of the changing pad but when they turn about 3 months, you run out of space.Comes in really heavy big packaging and it doesn't fit in car trunks. So probably best to have it delivered to your home instead of the office."
4,Nice,Very easy to put together and seems to be good quality. Nice piece of furniture and the cherry wood is rich looking.
3,Not as good as imagine,"This product outer quality is good, but the drawers material are very cheap one. So it's not as good as being described in the product description."
3,It's OK,"It's an OK changer. Not hard to assemble. But it's not very sturdy, and it's easy to make a scratch on the surface."
1,Not good,This table came with so many parts and it wd have helped if d parts were labeled for easy identification. Assembly took over 2 hrs and the back cover is made of heavy and poor bread board which fell apart during assembly. My husband had to cut a better and lighter board at home depot to cover the back. I really have doubts bout how long this item will last us.
4,Beautiful!,My husband and I put this together and had a fairly easy time. One of the drawers didn't line up exactly as we would have liked but it is still way worth it. I love the color and style of this changing table/dresser...it looks great in my nursery!
2,Not very strong and parts missing,This product is not strong at all and we had parts missing as well as hardware. I wouldn't recommend it! It's not worth buying this item.
2,"Beautiful, but falls apart","This piece was relatively easy to put together, and it looked great in my son's nursery. However, after a year or so of diaper changing and every day use, It started to fall apart. THe drawers were flimsy and they wouldn't stay attached. I ended up throwing it away after a year and a half."
2,not very strong,"i like to start of by saying cherry colour is not really cherry:(sad but true, it did not match my other davinci stuff that was also cherry.i am a little worried that the changing top will not be strong enough to hold a baby for long. its made out of partical board about 1/4 inch think. what if your little one happens to make a mess, that board is going to turn to mush.the construction is very poor and it not really worth the money, but to late now for me :("
4,Easy to asssemble (and unassemble),"This changing table was very easy to assemble and looks really nice. I was able to put it together by my self while I was pregnant. The problem is that the screws tend to come loose, so every time I move the table (by scooting it on the carpet) I have to tighten the screws or it wobbles. The changing table is comfortable for my little one, and she likes to grab onto the rails when I am changing her (although, that could be an issues for an older child)."
1,CHEAP CRAP !!!!!,"The dowel pins broke off on the top drawer after 2 months. now the drawer can not be put in or used. Only thing in the drawer was new born baby clothing. This furnature looks good, but BUYER BEWARE!!! It is CHEAP CRAP nad not made to last"
4,"French, but sounds like NY music","If you like Naked Music, Blue Six...etc, you should get this one! It is French, but it sounds like NY music in the late 90's. Unfortunately, it is getting hard to find this kind of music in the US now, and I was happy to find this CD in 2007!"
5,Canadian life on the prairie,"It's hard to describe what this is about, except that the writing and acting hold one's attention, and we are drawn into the world of life in an extremely small town on the prairie as it might be in a pleasant dream, with people we really like, who amuse us with their everyday frustrations, intrigues, and kindnesses."
4,Good performance and at a convenient price.,"This video card is not for super-gamers, but if you use your PC mainly for browsing or for ""not-too-heavy"" games it will do the job in an outstanding way. The Nvidia GPU processor is good for Linux users too, and is fairly superior than built-in video chips on some cheap Mobos. Recommended."
2,this book is out of date,"The book is 17 years out of date.Donald writes, """"Broca's region"" and ""Wernicke's region"" are convenient fictions, the truth being that aphasia can be caused by wide variety of legions that spare these areas, while occasionally the complete loss of these areas will spare language function altogether, provided the adjacent white matter and basal ganglia are not damaged. The implication is that higher-level integration appears to be fluid and plastic in its underlying anatomy, and the anatomy looks modular through out.""The current consensus refutes this position."
1,Nothing Yet,"This order was to arrive by 9/9/11. A week later, I still have not seen the order. Now, I got to follow up with customer service. What a pain."
2,Pieces Do Not Fit,"Unfortunately the largest of the dolls is very, very difficult to open and close. This gift is for my 7 year old and I can already foresee much frustration with her, especially since I have such a difficult time with it."
4,Good Product but confusion with shipping.,"The dolls are pretty and shiny. I am very satisfied with the product. However as mentioned, my doll was not send from Russia but from a local address in Illinois,USA. They also charged me $21.99 for international shipping, besides the price of the doll. When I wrote to the seller enquiring about it, they said that the dolls were originally shipped from Russia and that they send it from a local address to scrap time. That is why they are still charging an international shipment rate.The seller was swift in answering all my emails and very professional. When I asked them about the coin inside the doll which was missing, they promised me to send one separately in a 'simple envelope' in a day or two. I think its a very sweet gesture on their part and proves the personal attention they give to their customer.I would recommend it to everyone. The dolls are beautiful & adorable and the seller is good & efficient."
4,Good but not for water,"This product is the best sunscreen I've found, but it's not the best for water."
1,Not for surfers,"It may be a good sunscreen for landlubbers, but it ran into my eyes and stung like crazy the first time I used it. Not the best sunscreen when you're duck diving."
4,Very easy to apply,"I have always used California baby sunscreen, this is the first time I got this. I like the fact that it is easy to apply, chemical free, and that it is much cheaper than California baby. Why is the california baby so outrageously expensive?! Hey, if this is chemical free, i rather use the lizard brand."
3,I'm Not a Mormon!? :-),It's funny how most of the commentary to this book comes from non-Mormons with an excellent handle on Mormon apologetics. There's something fishy about that. :-)
1,Misleading to say the least,"I suppose if one would like to take an odyssey into one woman's disfunctional world, this is the book for you. However, the commentary on the book--from the jacket to the prevailing reviews--seem to suggest it gives an ""insiders"" view into the Mormon Church. This could not be further from the truth. This woman's experience is so atypical of the Mormon experience that it is laughable the two are connected."
5,DEBORAH - WONDERFUL PERSON - WONDERFUL BOOK,"I knew Deborah Laake quite well and she was an honest, intelligent, compassionate, broad-minded and lovely young woman whose work can be trusted. This book is a must-read for women of any religious heritage to make themselves aware of the power of the religious leaders on the lives of a woman. Thank you, Deborah."
3,Somewhat true!,"Although the basic information in this book is true, I found it a little bit too negative. While I agree that Mormonism does contain many cult like attributes (like blindly following a prophet --also like in Waco, Tx) it isn't however usually as negative as the author sees it. For a better unbiased look into Mormonism try ""No Man Knows My History"" by Fawn M. Brodie. It contains facts about Joseph Smith which are backed by historical documents. Ahhh what the ""morons"" here in SLC don't care to read...."
2,"Interesting, but not representative","I found this book to be an interesting story of one woman's life. However it is just that...one woman's life and I do not think that her story is representative of LDS women by any means. Her marriage problems probably had more to do with other problems rather than just her religion. If you're looking for a deep dark expose and don't care about what really goes on, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a more balanced account of LDS life, keep looking."
1,Very Sad,"Deborah Laake's story is a very sad one. As a roughcontemporary of hers, I was in many of the same places and situationsthat she talks about -- and her portrayal of them rings false to me at every point. I don't doubt that she sincerely felt the way she says she did, but I do very much doubt that the fault was altogether where she placed it. Her recent suicide suggests, unfortunately, that her unhappiness was internal, not caused by external factors. I'm saddened, too, by the eagerness with which some readers (as evidenced by several of the reviews below) seized upon this unfortunate woman as a focus for their own anger against Mormons and Mormonism. But I'm not surprised. There are people out there, some of them in print, who even hate Mother Teresa of Calcutta, for heaven's sake. END"
1,You've got to be kidding me,"(I'm quoting from the review, because I don't have the book in front of me) I'm not sure where to begin, except to say that the kind of ""Mormonism"" the author describes is nothing like the ""Mormonism"" I've observed and experienced. In the ""Mormonism"" I'm familiar with (and thousands of others like me), nobody is ""sent"" to BYU, although although some women go just to find a husband -- people with priorities like that, male or female are a waste of space at any university. There's no ""one true wedding partner destined by God"". Not just Americans, but even Mormons would consider a life ""that included the recycling of condoms through vigorous washing"" to be a ""bizarre life"" indeed.It was a mistake for the author to blame her problems on a religion she so thoroughly misunderstood, and it's a mistake for anyone to judge the Mormon church one way or the other based on the version of Mormonism presented in this book."
