1,great movie and features but....,First let me set this clear this a great movie but i ordered this new off of amazon and when i first got it i thought it was new but once i took off the plastic wrapping and stickers the case looked smudged and used. when i opened it and took disk 1 out i saw there was huges scratches all over the bottom of it and when i put it in too see if it works it skiped a lot wich made it unwatchable. so this sucks because i paid money for a new dvd and got what a quess a used dvd which is broken. not happy
5,Sweet movie!,This movie was awesome I give it two thumbs up. The director acting skills and everything else about this movie was absoloutley amazing!
4,Reservoir Dogs,"Four Perfect Killers. One easy Heist. One Rat.Listen, RD is a great movie. It has flaws, but thats ok. It has ultracool dialogue, hong-kong style violence, and references to the hong-kong and american crime movies that writer-director Tarantino grew up with. The film opens with Tarantino himself showing just how cool his writing can be as he explains his interpretation of madodnna's Like a virgin to the rest of the team.Then it cuts to the aftermath of the heist, where the four remaining criminals try to work out who set them up.With a cast that does the dialogue justice, at the end we are surprrised to find that some of these ultra cool killers affect us more than we expected.I didnt love this as much as i did the later Pulp Fiction, but its still a great movie by a guy who obviously loves great movies."
5,A clean masterpiece,"This breakout film by Quentin Tarantino never gets predictable, never gets boring, and never gets old. The ultimate vicarious thriller invites the audience to get its kicks by sympathizing with a group of violent thieves who plan and nearly pull off a bank robbery, only to sustain heavy casualties in the face of police gunfire, internal dissension, and a possible rat in their midst. Madsen's torture of a young cop, culminating in the slicing of said cop's ear, is a classic movie scene. Awesome effort by all involved."
3,Reservoir Dogs 15 th Anniversary Edition,i wrong buy it. I think this edition gas can ... because I see picture insert it. But is okey because i don't have it. Nice story but average transfer maybe next someday i will buy blu-ray edition.
3,Good movie,"Tarantino is a fake, from beginning to end. But putting this fact aside and judging only the movie, not the man behind the cameras, you'll see this is a good movie, although violent and exaggerated. The acting is very good, the budget is low (and this is a merit for Tarantino). Anyway, we soon saw how limited this director is when not dealing with violence and ideas he steals from older movies, comic books and songs."
5,DVD transfer well done but short on extras,"A very good and clever film by the great Tarantino. DVD transfer provides average sound and picture. Widescreen picture is an added bonus. The only negative is the DVD has no special features. Sooner or later, a re-release of the DVD will take care of that. A Tarantino-Bender track would be interesting for the future. However, the DVD on the market now, is well worth buying for your collection. This movie holds up to repeated veiwings and it gets better each time."
5,It doesn't get much better than this.,"With an impressive cast of characters, Tarantino creates a dark, yet unsuspectingly humorous look at organized crime and deception. Buscemi's performance is immaculate!"
4,Do you like K billys,"The deleted scenes on this DVD is class, I love Tarantinos work, Buy this, its a collectors item with a special K bIlly radio station on the DVD so you can listen to your favourite songs, my words ""Brilliant, buy it, if not for me but for youself, you owe yourself this much at least"""
2,"Great Movie, Poor 10th Ann. DVD","I was so happy to finally get the 10th Ann. version home and into my DVD, because frankly it is a movie that I can watch multiple times and still find new things in it. And also there was a commentary track on it, oh and there is one, but it is a ""Interview"" style commentary track, using past interviews with cast and crew. Not what I was expecting, would have loved to have had the Director commenting on the film as it played out in front of him, like in other DVD's. So again I am let down by a great movie that has been moved to DVD with not much more than archived material."
2,What can I say?,"This movie get's worse everytime I watch it. Nobody in real life swears like these guys, I don't care if you're in the Mafia, you don't say walk around every 2 seconds going F--k This, F--k That!The only performances I like in this film is Steve Buscemi as the humerous Mr.Pink and Tim Roth's character, who ends up the rat.I thought the scene where Mr.Pink is running from the police is one of the greatest in the film.Bottom line: Some good acting, but lacks what I liked in Pulp Fiction."
1,No case?,I don't usually buy used DVD blue rays online but I expected a case since that is what is shown.
4,"Great transfer, terrible extras.","This is sort of a trap, you know, you have to own both the 10th and the 15th anniversary eds. because the extras in this version are terrible, but the transfer is sweet."
1,Bad Dog!,"I rented this movie because I heard that it was such a gangster classic. Man, whoever gave this movie a rating of classic couldn't be more wrong. Don't get me wrong this movie was full of talent, but the movie itself was just horrible. We jump from the events prior to the diamond heist to the chaos that followed after. We didn't get to see the actual heist or the crews shootout with the cops just them talk about it. I don't know about you, but I personally would rather see the action for myself.Another reason why i disliked this film was beacuse it left to many questions unanswered, like what how and when did Mr. Blue get killed. And Mr. Brown's deaf was so unbelievable. One minute his driving the getaway car and the next he's dead? HORRIBLE FILM!"
1,"Bad Script,, Useless Violence","I found the movie rather pointless....the script was definitely canned, it felt like I was watching a play. It never drew me into it, and most of it is set in an empty warehouse, which left nothing but the script to carry it. I also felt they were having blood just for blood's sake....the point of the movie? The cops are [jerks], gangsters are [jerks]---the whole world is full of [jerks]? That's great, Sherlock, how long did it take you to figure that one out?"
1,Wrong Item Received!!,I ordered Reservoir Dogs (15th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray] and what I received is Of Gods and Men (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) (2011). I hope Amazon will do something about this.
1,Worst Movie Ever,[...] Perfect example of a movie with a great cast and garbage for plot and production. I think the film I turned in for my 7th grade English project was better than this. If I could go back in time I would go back to when I was about to rent this movie and then punch myself in the stomach and steal my wallet. At least it wasn't as bad as Inkheart. That movie was horrible. But I would rather watch Hannah Montana season 1 than waste my time on Reservoir Dogs.
1,Dated,"It's amazing what ten years can do to a film. What was fresh and unique in 1992 is now overdone cliche in 2002. The true test to any film is how well it stands the test of time, and this film cannot stand well at all. The scenes are cumbersome and contrived. The acting is forced, and the violence is comically overdone, but not to the film's benefit."
5,THIS FILM ROCKS.,"This film is as good as they come, it is one of the best films I have ever only 2 can rivel it, FACE/OFF and The Shawshank Redemption. In short you MUST see this film it is sick, funny and amazingly compelling"
5,The best movie I've ever seen.,This movie is one of the greatest pieces of film ever made. Its dialoge is the most realistic I have ever heard on film and the acting is way above what you see in any film in the past decade. The actors are all superb on their own and the combination defines on-screen chemistry. Its subtle plot twists and timing can only be truely understood upon seeing the movie several times. It gets better every time you watch it.
2,Wait for the 8-27-2002 reissue,"If it's not in your DVD collection at this point, you might as well wait it out until the 10th Anniversary edition. This initial release is subpar at best due to the non-anamorphic widescreen and tinny dolby digital track. Only the movie itself makes me bump the DVD up to 2 stars."
5,MOVIE,BOUGHT THIS MOVIE FOR MY SON. HE JUST LOVES QUENTIN TARENTINO MOVIES ALL OF THEM AND HE ESPECAILLY LIKES THIS ONE THE BEST
4,Wild,"I dont see why the directing is so amazing, I just loved the story. Its one of those movies that keeps you guessing the whole way through, and your still suprised when you get to the end. It was boring at parts, but a little while in, it gets real good...and come the end, its pure suspense. This movie was amazing."
1,What?,"I want to know who made these shot glasses. For Mr. Brown, they have a picture of Vic Vega. Therefore, for Mr. Blonde they have Nice Guy Eddie? How did this happen? I never understood why they put Chris Penn in a suit for promos in the first place. I mean have they even seen the movie?Anyway, if you have one of the other million editions of this movie, stay away from this one."
5,Tarantino's Explosive Debut,"What can't be said about Reservoir Dogs. Great direction by Quentin Tarantino, great acting by Steve Busemi and Harvey Kietel, and unrelentless violence make this film a masterpiece to many and hated by some.The film is about five criminals whose codenames are colors so that they don't know who each other really are. When the team is trying to perform a heist, something goes seriously wrong and the team is trying to figure out who ratted them out.With a chaotic film structure that is like nothing else in film, and a reality that is both shocking and frightening, Reservoir Dogs did what most people in Mainstream Hollywood are afraid to do. It's a classic and is definately some of the best work Tarantino has ever done. SEE IT!"
2,I don't get the hype,"So I finally decided to watch this after everyone telling me that I 'simply had to because it's so awesome'. Well, its not. I almost fell asleep. I knew what was going to happen in the end and throughout the whole movie, I just couldnt understand why people love this movie so much. It was pretty useless. When I hear people call it a 'cult classic', I laugh, its just too absurd. I will not be listening to hyped up nonsense anymore."
2,Narcissism at it's best,"Another ""witty"", implausible Tarantino romp, whereby all the characters seem to be representations of Tarantino himself. This movie is beyond ridiculous, I really do not think it will stand the test of time. Highly derivative, do you really think that after a botched robbery, the thieves would head back to the warehouse!!??? And would the Boss go to that said warehouse??? Never!!Also, missing ""interior of the jewelry exchange during the robbery"" scenes from an earlier 90's VHS release, not that they made the film that much better, but they added insight to the maniacal behavior of Madsen."
2,Reservoir dogs,Its kinda boring show. The only interesting part of the movie is constant arguing.... which the whole movie is only showing them quarreling in a warehouse. The whole movie is in the warehouse and nothing more. So its kinda boring i guess.
3,Great movie - Shame about the DVD,"I love RD. I own a previous version of this DVD, but I could not resisit the special edition of my favourite movie, so I bought it.I was shocked to find the the DVD video and audio quality is inferior to the previously released regular edition. These are the technical problems that I found with the DVD:Washed out colors. Colors are terrible on the movie. Interior scenes are a bit better, but external scenes are just terrible.Inferior DTS track. It just sounds terrible and mudy. I had problems understanding conversations in the movie using DTS. In a dialogue driven movie, this is terrible. The Dolby track is a bit better, but not much better than the regular version Dolby track.No English Subtitles. This I find very wierd. The original version contained English subtitles.I recommend that you leave this one. Pick up the original version, it is bound to be chaper."
2,Not Sold As Advertised :-(,"The film is advertised on Amazon as a special edition coming in unique ""special edition"" packaging. When I got my copy it was in a regular DVD box. I was disappointed even though the film is great."
2,Not like the picture,Unfortunatly when i ordered the movie there was a picture of how the packing looked like but when i recieved it i found that it dosn't look like what was in the picture. I was disappointed. I hav't seen the movie though.
1,Shameless,"Don't get me wrong, Reservoir Dogs as a movie is fully deserving of 4 or 5 stars (I say 4 OR 5 because it's starting to show it's age). It's a modern classic that any real film addict must have seen by now. This reveiw is of the Special Edition DVD box set release of the film.Listen to me carefully when I say this: THIS BOX SET COLLECTS FOUR IDENTICAL 2-DISC DVD RELEASES OF RESERVOIR DOGS. The ONLY DIFFRENCE between these 4 copies are their BOX COVERS. Content wise the discs are the same.It was a blatant enough move to release diffrent covers for the same movie, that's an obvious grab at your wallet from ARTISAN ENTERTAINMENT. But to then release a oh-so-holy box set collecting the covers is taking it a step too far. It's best to avoid collections like this at all costs, let's not make it into a trend. Thank you Artisan, your losing any respectable reputation you may have had by the minute. Quit wasting our time."
3,Bluray should sound better,"I was disappointed with the sound quality of this Blu-ray release. The opening dialog is fun but I had to really crank the volume to hear it. Then when the music came on it was an order of magnitude louder so I was dialing up and down the volume throughout the movie which isn't something that should be necessary in this day and age.I'd be interested to hear if other reviewers noted this. Perhaps the original sound quality was poor? The music sounds outstanding but in comparison, the dialog is mixed too low in my opinion. The video is very good. I have no other format of RDogs to compare this release to."
5,Reservoir Dogs,"A brilliant, brutal heist film focusing on the before and after rather than the act itself, Tarantino's darkly funny ""Reservoir Dogs"" was the most auspicious debut of the 1990s, brought to life through the efforts of Keitel, who was impressed with the unconventional script. Tarantino peppers his film with pop-culture references, salty dialogue, and flashbacks that not only heighten suspense but fill in the back stories of his key characters. Keitel, Roth, Buscemi, Chris Penn, and Michael Madsen really run with their roles as bickering psychopaths. Great use of `70's period music as well- anyone remember ""Stuck In The Middle With You?"" At once graphically violent and darkly funny, ""Reservoir Dogs"" has one hell of a bite."
2,Not what I expected,"All my friends hyped this movie up. So, I gave it a chance and bought it. It was NOT that good. I've seen a lot of organized crime movies and this one was one of the worst. I don't know.. I didn't like it."
3,"Good debut for Tarantino, but...","First of all, I agree with some of the other reviewers with regards to the casting and the editing of the movie. Superb performances by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Chris Penn and Steve Buscemi. Number two, a nice preparation for what lay ahead with Pulp Fiction, in terms of the editing and playing with the timeline, going back and forth, to tell the story in little pieces, almost ending with the middle of the story.As for the downside: I didn't find the story as compelling as Pulp Fiction's. Sometimes it can be funny, but the violence and the blood in the movie are pointless more than once and they don't contribute quite enough a brilliant storyline. Overall, I found it to be an good debut by Tarantino. As far as I'm concerned, ""Pulp Fiction"" was his first big break, and the best thing he did until the Kill Bill series."
2,Once Again! Cencorship Ruins A Great Song.,"The Video Is Clean Just Like The One On Greatest Videoz! The Only Song That Isn't Clean Is My Generation. I Don't Hate This, I'm A Big LB Fan So This Is Still Kinda Nice."
3,Poor keyboard compatibility but very reliable.,I have one at work and one at home and I have to say this thing is picky about what keyboard you can use with it. It was not a faulty unit (because tested 3 different units). It would not work with 4 other keyboards. One logitech and 2 Memorex ones (which i liked) and a microsoft wireless.So I have to use a HP KU-0316 keyboard which works great with it which is also the ones they issued in my job.Other than that its really the only good dual monitor KVM that otherwise very reliable and a solid piece of hardware.
5,If allowed I would give 10 stars,"This album was so refreshing when it came out amidst music that was more rehashing what had been done as opposed to pushing boundaries-as this album clearly did. These songs are great and are all unique to themselves. Members of this band went on to form Count-Zero. This another band worth lending your ear to. Check them out at count-zero.com, and get this CD if its available"
3,Just okay,I have read two other P D James books and couldn't put them down. This one didnt satisfy me and I didnt like the ending.
4,Intriguing,"P.D. James is great as always. I really enjoyed reading this book, however it is not quite as good as some others such as The Private Patient, Death in Holy Orders. I just felt that introduction to the mystery took awhile, and then there were loose ends."
3,Good...but not for the younger girls,"This book is fun and very tongue-in-cheek and makes you feel good about those cute chunky thighs. The book is promoted for women ""11-111"", but it is NOT appropriate for girls in their early teen years. I bought the book for my 12 year old daughter, but I'm glad I read it first. I will not be giving it to her. Some of the drawings are a bit too graphic, and sexuality is mentioned as though the reader is sexually active. This book is OK for grown women, but not for young girls as it will only further bewilder them."
3,A dose of confidence for pre-teens.,"This book is cute in spots. It seems designed to placate adolescent fears about the developing female body. It is obviously not directed toward an American audience. The factual content is a few years behind.As a 40 something woman struggling with body image issues, I was disappointed. I give it a lower rating because the description didn't match the content very well.It is well-suited for an eleven year old girl."
2,a disapointment,"Back in the day, Ninja Turtles were my life. I had the lunchbox, the figures, and the VHS'. When i saw that the new tv series and toy line was coming out, i was extactic. Then i watched the show and bought the figures, only to learn they were [bad]. At first, the figures are amazing; they have great detail and an awesome look. Then, when you actually try to play with one, you realize how the arms only move at the shoulder and the legs can only move at the hip (there's no joint at the elbow or knee so it's really hard to have them fight each other realistically). Okay, a setback, but I keep playing. As Leo's sword hits Shredder as the first blow, i noticed his weapon was some sort of flimsy, soft plastic that would bend with the touch of a finger. This, along with all the other complaints i have about the figures, caused me to never really use them again."
2,duck charm,"I ordered it for my daughter who is a duck lover, but unfortunately had to return it due to being way overpriced due to its tiny size. It would be a good buy for $25."
1,BAD!!!,The jet flame packs got jammed the 1st time I pushed it in!!! I pressed the button just they wouldn't shoot back out!!! I don't know if its just mine or its on all of them but I'm very dissapointed because I like displaying all my ninja turtles and 1 is brokin!!And another thing the thing u attach at the bottomwont stay in it keeps coming out!!!!!! Useless piece of junk!!!!If some 1 else writes a review tell me if it happend 2 yours.Buy at your own risk. C U later.
3,"Good stick, but poor hanging design","I like the stick itself for the quality of the wood and the simple design, however the ball-and-socket assembly design did not work for us. It did not align correctly to line up flat on the wall nor for the 2 pieces (upper and lower stick) to line up just right vertically. I also didn't like the 3/4-inch or so gap between the upper and lower pieces of the stick. But since we didn't have a better option, I modified this one by cutting a piece of similar wood to fill the gap and epoxy it into one solid stick, and then attached it to the wall using a hinge-like bracket (L-bracket would work too) at the top and bottom so it would hold securely to the wall instead of moving around."
3,OK for play meat,I had high hopes after receiving the biofino bread. This just wasn't up to the same standard. The bread is very realistic and textured and this is just printed felt. It is thick felt though. Overall my son was very pleased and it's just the right size for the bread. I was just expecting it to be as life like. Not bad for the price.
5,The Best Books I've Ever Read!,"If you are feeling deep and slightly dark at heart, or if you have a problem reaching and knowing your dark side, read this book. I'm not saying that this book show cases humainity as killers, but it does make you think, hard. Well, I read this book last year and I'm planning on reading it again, and I don't do that often. It's that good... I'd compare it to A Separate Peace, or Lord of the Flies. I couldn't put the book down, and it has totally changed my life. I cried, I was enraged, but I don't believe that I laughed. This is not a candy coated book. I suggest it being read in a small group from 8th graders to about 100+. I don't recommend it to anyone under 7th grade, its just not that kind of book. I get shudders from the thought of it, and I mean it when I say that I have never read another book with the same level of craftsmenship or insight. One word to conclude with: Amazing! ~Lyra~"
4,Winston Weyn Grows up,"I first read this book in 1974 and was very engrossed in it. The characters and the situation were very believable then- I wonder how much so in the early 60s when it was written.It shows what can happen when we repress people and fail to consider their needs, wants, and aspirations. The revolution never would have happened if the counselors would have made age appropriate activities for all the kids. It never would have gone as far as it did if it had a definite ending.From my perspective as a teacher and watching Columbine and other similar situations, I'm sorry to say that the nightmare is now here, and what will happen later depends on what we choose to do."
4,Read the book in class.,"I am in the eigth grade. My class and I read this book together. We finished the book 11/5/98. I thought the book was very interesting. The way the author made the book a diary was a unique idea. This book was somewhat like the book ""Katheren Called Birdy"". Both books are about teenagers going through a hard time in their lives. In ""Butterfly Revolution"" Winston Weyn goes to a summer camp as a birthday gift from his parents. Interesting things happen at the camp. Read the book and find out what they are yourself."
4,I liked this book.,"I had to read this book almost at the end of the year and I thought this was going to be another boring book. At first i started reading it maybe fifteen pages a day, but then I got into it halfway through then I was hooked. I liked this book because it has teenagers like us in the story and they go crazy and start a revolution. The Buttterfly Revolution is sad, funny, and very entertaining."
4,Good book but draws from lord of the flies,"This book is a little slow at the begining, but it really picks up the pace about 50 pages into the book. Things start happening so fast and it all fits together. You won't know what happens till the end of the book. But this book does not deserve all prases. It is alot like ""Lord of the flies"", which is the origanal kids on their own book. It takes alot from that book and credit is due their. But it is a great book on it's own and introduces alot of it's own ideas, in it's own aspect."
4,High Pines,"With all the hoopla around ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""Animal Farm"" that is presented to children, why not get them started with this younger generation book. A younger rendeition of the aforementioned classics, this is a riveting, fast-packed read.At the camp of High Pines, a revolution starts by the 'leader' of campers, in hopes of forever change. However, General Frank, the benevolent, fearless leader turns into something far from a utilitarian dictator. The characters are real and will relate well with the younger crowd.A quick read that is wroth many reads and that will be enjoyed by young and old a like. I think that if you like Harry Potter and his adventures, you will also enjoy Frank and his camping adventure."
5,Wonderful book,"I read this one as a child. A lot of people mention the parallels between this and Lord of the Flies, but I think they have slightly different themes. Lord of the Flies was about the thin veneer of civilization, especially thin among children. The Butterfly Revolution is about the naivete of youthful politics. The Butterfly Revolution is reminiscent of idealistic communist revolutions that turned into dictatorships. LOTF is about children descending into savagery. TBR is about the childishness of revolutionaries."
5,The best book I've EVER read!,"I read the Butterfly revolution for Summer reading. I figured that it would be somewhat of a snooze and that I'd have to force myself to read it. Boy was I wrong! It was suspenful, funny, sad and thrilling all at once! But The Butterfly Revolution Grabbed me up and wouldn't let me put it down until the last page. I highly recomend this book for Teenagers and Adults alike!"
5,The one complete book for Spiner fans,"Mimi Braverman's book ""The Spin on Spiner"" lists every film Brent has made, names his character, describes the scenes and his comments about the role. The same is done for all his live stage productions prior to ""1776,"" and all TV appearances (except StarTrek series which can be found in other sources). ""Spin"" includes pages of biography and personal background. Everything is documented--no gossip, no guesswork, just very good reading."
1,Broken mouse after 6 months,"I got this lap top for my 2 year old son during the summer when we were taking a train trip. He didn't love it then of course, but after we got home he started to really enjoy it. He lost interest for a while and when he rediscovered it I discovered the mouse had broken during the time no one was playing with it. It can click, but won't move the ""cursor"" on the screen up, down, left or right making most of the activities useless. And of course when I called vtech it's now a discontinued product and we can't get it fixed for replace. They are sending a new toy at the same value (24.99) but well, my son likes THIS one, not a different toy. I'm very disappointed and probably won't be buying another vtech toy if this is how durable they all are."
4,17 month old daughter loves it,"I bought this for my daughter because she is always trying to hit the keys and move the mouse on my desk top. This is close enough to the real thing and the price is good too. She carries it around everywhere. The screen is pretty small but for her age it's great, adults don't need to play with it. However I wouldn't recommend for a child over 3. Not enough learning activities and the black and grey picture would not keep their attention as much as a younger child (too plain and boring for them)."
3,hmmm. Son got bored so did I,"The fact that the keys are in colored and the screen is not I think made my son bored. Kind of a hassle to set up and get my son interested. Too small of a screen, and it is black and white. Sorry I would not buy it again. It is at the bottom of the toy box."
4,Big fun for my 2 year old,This was a Chirstmas present for my little boy and has become ones of his faves. He enjoys the music and the sounds from the Thomas the Train show and has already started to recognize some letters and numbers. I love that he has started to become acquainted with the mouse and basic computer operations. This toy has quite a few different activities and games-my son loves them! The only downfall is that in order to do the activities- you have to either push the Activities button and enter the number of the activity or push the numbers at the top. My son is not able to do this without assistance so if he plays by himself he gets a little frustrated and turns it off. It would be nice if the keys did more when not in activity mode. Overall I would recommend for 2-4 year olds especially if they love Thomas!
5,great learning toy for children with asd,"Bought this toy for my 2 year old son whom is on the specs for autism he is non-verbel and this toy has been a great learning tool for him as he will answer the questions by pushing the correct button. We do flash cards and I haven't gotten him to say anything. I can't say that it has tought him his abc and 123 but it helps me know what he knows and doesn't when it comes to this area of learning. I'm sure it has helped him to so point of learning. It does have many activities abc,123,shapes,music,and much more. Yes the screen is black but it doesn't bother him much. I would purches this laptop again for my child its a great gift for that special little one that loves thomas the train!"
5,Must have tool for chevy hinge pin replacement.,"This tool made it mutch easier to remove and replace the hinge pin bushings on my chevy truck. Highly recommended to make the job easier.If you are going to do this job, I also recommend purchasing the spring compressor. I tried the zip tie method to compress the spring, and it did not work well for me; the zip ties kept failing and it was difficult.I used a 1/4"" ratchet extension to hammer out the pins (fits well on the end of the pin without slipping off), but in afterthought would recommend the steck tool for pin removal if you can spare the extra money. It is not necessary, but would probably make the job easier."
2,Minimilist production pales in comparison with others.,"Sets and costumes are minimal, little more than limbo sets enhanced with lighting. Andrew Davis's conducting is slow paced, dry, lacking in nuance or excitement. Technical quality of picture and sound, however, are excellent. If you must have a DVD version of this opera, go ahead and purchase. Otherwise, better to wait for the filmed version, with the Wiener Philharmoniker, James Levine conducting, directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle. So much more exciting visually and musically, with principals Tatiana Troyanos, Carol Neblett, Catherine Malfitano, Anne Howels, Eric Tappy and Kurt Rydl. Hopefully this version will be released on DVD soon, and worth waiting for. Otherwise, try and get a used copy on LD or simply order on VHS!Update: I see that the Ponnelle filmed version is in fact now available so I recommend that as the better option!"
1,Awful,"Recording quality is poor, singing almost as poor, with double tracks used to disguise the weak voice. Very disppointing"
1,Pure trash,"I don't know why I even bothered wasting my money on this book; it was so bad. There was one thing that really bothered me with this book and the one prior. Why is it that Rain is always sleeping with someone? Corbette, Roy, and later that red-headed doofus in the third book. She comes off as quite a slut; kinda like a cheap, stupid, nasty version of Cathy. I didn't like Rain and I don't know why this book was ever published..."
4,Rain in London,"I'll make this short:I like this book better then Rain. I also like how the writer put her in London. I don't think any other of the characters have traveled outside of the USA and it was a nice change of pace, like going on vacation without moving an inch. Rain's reunion with the father she never met was kind of sad but as they form a tenative bond it becomes happier."
1,THE USUAL,"Any VC Andrews/Ghostwriter reader knows the scenario: one talented young female, shadowy mansions, a change in economic status and of course, incest. I really didn't like the way Roy put on that stupid phony act (p. 321) of not knowing who Rain was. I agree that it does insult the readers' intelligence. That part really turned me off. You knew right off the bat Rain and Roy would become lovers. How much do you want to bet by the next installment Rain has Roy's love child? One can bet she has a Roy, Jr. or a girl with a nature themed name. The Rain series would have been good if Rain and Roy had kept their relationship fraternal as they were raised like siblings. With VC Andrews/GW, these kinds of incestuous and quasi-incestuous unions are standard fare. Skip this one."
4,Getting back to basics...,"This book is one of the few recent releases under the V.C. Andrews name that wasn't completely predictable. While the themes are generally the same, the path the author was going down wasn't always obvious. It kept you interested in what was going to happen to Rain next.Hopefully the next novel continues down these lines."
2,"Okay, but not great","I just expected more. None of the minor characters are really very developed, and there's no clear indication of who Rain's ""true love"" will be. Rain doesn't spend very much time at the theater school at all. And the ""secret"" that will be revealed in the next book is already so obvious. There is one unexpected twist, though. I would recommend it for VC die-hards and anyone who really liked the first book, RAIN, but if you're just starting to read VC books, try something else."
3,not as good as i thought....,Rain is very confused and boring in this book. She doesn't have the same personality as in the first novel in the series. The first book was great the second not as good as i thought. But there was a very exciting twist towards the end which made the book not so boring.Looking forward to the next book!
2,Cliche,"This book follows the formulaic Andrews/ghostwriter pattern. I did hope Rain would have more sense than to sleep with Randy and Roy. I was hoping this series would take a different turn from the usual. Rain was a much more appealing character, so I had hoped for her to make more informed decisions instead of becoming just another cliche Andrews/Ghostwritten character."
4,"Pretty good, GW redeems himself...somewhat","Like one reviewer said, as of late I too have just simply wished that the new books would hurry up and end for they seem to drag on and on. But this novel was a surprise and moved at a rather fast pace and one scene in the book, while disturbing is a word best to describe it, brought back VCA's old style of writing, thus the GW actually taking a cue from VCA instead of repeating her words. Aside from seeing similarites to Dawn and Secrets of the Morning in this novel and in Rain, I can already sense what Eye of the Storm will be about and perhaps you will too. But all in all, this is a novel not to be missed, if you are only getting it to keep current or to read."
1,Not Good,"I agree with all the negative reviews. I'm tired of brother-sister or half-brother/half-sister unions. I'm also tired of people raised as siblings ending up in the sack. The thing I found most distateful about this book was Roy's stupid phony act of not knowing who Rain was when they finally (and you knew they would) slept together. It was so stupid, phony, contrived and such an insult to all readers' intelligence. Get an umbrella for the RAIN!"
3,"Something borrowed, Something new","Well, this series is just like the Cutler series. Despite it being so predictable I did like the fact that there was some new diversity. Although I didn't like how the darker sister (Benny or Benji) was villianized in the first book, but that's just my pet peeve and I really don't expect anything different when it's written from an outsider's perspective. Anyway, I resent the fact that the ghostwriter(s) can't seem to let these girls be anything except dancers, painters or singers. It's like saying that the only thing that a desirable innocent girl can do is something in the cultural arts. Why can't these women be fiercly intellectual? The only ones who are smart, are the unattractive and evil ones.I don't want to say only negative things, because I do feel that the series had improved... a little. Hopefully, somebody is paying attention to the posts, so the readers can get something more substantial."
2,A disappointment,"Well, I know I'm in the minority here. But a real history of the connection between music and race in America is something that it desperately needed. One might expect an academic historian to have provided that. But this book is NOT a good history - it's highly impressionistic and rather anecdotal and full of ideas that aren't exactly explained. It jumps around from chapter to chapter making much of the impressions that the author has about the 'hidden' messages within songs, but I'm afraid that he states rather than argues or proves his case. I hope someone out there DOES write the book that's needed. In the meantime this one is interesting if the style doesn't bother you too much."
4,Overall a good buying experience,"book was cheap, but brand new and in perfect condition. received it within the estimated time span, but of course would have liked it sooner/on the earlier side of the time span ;)"
3,so so,"This is my first baby, thus my first diaper bag so I have nothing to compare it too, but I rarely use it. If I'm taking my baby out I just carry one of those portable changing pads that store diapers and wet wipes. If it's near her feeding time I throw a bottle in an Avent insulated cooler. As far as toys, I just hook them to the stroller (the one that matches this bag). For the money, I wish I wouldn't have bought it. Not only that, the zipper broke within the first week. It's quite expensive and I feel that it's really an unnecessary purchase."
5,I love this Diaper Bag!!!,"I love all the compartments and now use it as a purse as well because they give you a slot to put all your own personal items in it. Having all the little slots for diapers, etc is a nice way to organize everything. I love that it also matches my stroller travel system."
3,looking for a smaller one....,"I do like this diaper bag, however its really big... and i want a smaller one that matches everything else we have(stroller, carseat, pack & play, etc..) i want something i can take with us when we go out to eat, to the grocery store, etc... instead of lugging this big ol thing around. However, its REALLY nice when we are gone all day and i can put everything in it i will need and more! does anybody know where to find a smaller one or if they even make it?"
2,Graco-Diaper Bag,"I have mixed feelings about this bag. First, I like that it has alot of room. It matches my stroller and is easy to organize items. I like the credit card organizer.However, as my son has gotten bigger and we are carrying even more stuff around, this bag does not expand at all. The bag also does not fit under the stroller (Graco brand also) very well. It usually ends up sticking out the back because once the bag is full, it won't easily get into the bottom of the stroller. In addition, the bag is difficult to clean."
3,"Love the look, hated the bulk!","It's just entirely too big, unless of course you want to carry your baby in it, too. (teasing) When you're a tired Mom (especially at first), the last thing you need is to carry something around that gets too heavy when you load it up, not to mention it's entirely too bulky to carry and store.Love Graco, but was disappointed by this!"
3,dolled up but not a timeless classic,"This movie was kind of a chore to get through. It had a lot of elements that have been successful in the past: Jane Russell, cruising, Paris, songs (but neither catchy nor memorable) and pretty Dior-type dresses i.e. shortened ballgowns. It just didn't have the charm and talent of movies like Gentlemen Prefer Blondes."
2,Disc Errors,"Just a warning, a UK buyer of this MOD disc has said there are multiple disc errors making the film unplayable as it skips and freezes. Maybe just a one-off problem, but could this be the same as NIGHT THE BRIDGE FELL DOWN which also had problems from Warner Archive."
5,Superb Voice,I dn know what some guys are looking. This system is man just incredible. What you want is quality sound and save space. This is what this system has. I know this much that this system scares my neighbours with terible sound effects. It has both high quality sound and high sound. Price is bit high. Well you need to scracth your pocket a bit to hear it. :)
3,Ok sound. Big price tag,"The cubes sound decent but the overall package is lacking because of the subwoofer. The first thing I did is replace the subwoofer with an $800 12"" JBL which requires running your speakers directly into the receiver. So then more speaker wire is required. When it was all said and done, not including the receiver, I paid over $2000. A bit pricey for something that only sounds decent but that is how to get the best out of a bose system. I bought my mom the Definitive Technology 60.6 for $400 and it outperforms my acoustimass 15 in an obvious way. I hope I can save someone out there some money. Don't buy into the hype that bose is the best."
1,Overpriced Junk with Shiny Marketing,"I bought a set of these for my sister-in-law because she was convinced Bose was the best. For comparison, I had installed a $300 multimedia computer speaker system for her son a few months prior. the $300 system put these things to shame. if you do a little research, you learn that bose is basically radio shack quality speakers with nike level marketing. i suggest you do your research before paying for a fancy ad campaign."
5,Works good,Has worked more than a couple times for me. Even if it breaks the next time it would be worth getting another. Cant beat the price.
5,A must have if you live in the Pocono Mts. of Pa.,"Went to a local mechanic and was told my car had 2 bad catalytic converters, The car was then taken to a Mazda dealer who said only one converter was bad. Both mechanics said they looked at the converters no one did a back pressure test, want it done right do it yourself. Tester is well made and worked fine."
1,NOT WORKING AT ALL,THIS ITEM I BOUGHT IS NOT WORKING AT ALL. I AM PLANNING TO RETURN IT BY NEXT WEEKLAMINE TOURE
2,"I think they meant to say ""Manhattan Baby""","If you live in Manhattan and are considering enrolling your two-year-old in French classes, this is the ideal book for you. If you, too, think that Central Park is the biggest park in NYC, you've found two authors with your point of view. But if you live outside of Manhattan, there's much less here for you.Still, if you're going to be giving birth in Manhattan this book has a large amount of useful information, including the phone numbers and Cesarean rates for many hospitals, where to take childbirth classes, and how to hire a midwife. This edition has a chapter on Brooklyn (well, Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights) -- a step in the right direction."
4,Good resource,"I found this book very helpful when searching for hospitals and prenatal classes, and continue to find it a good resource when shopping for baby gear and looking for fun activities. It has a great chapter on Brooklyn as well as a thorough listing of Manhattan resources. Most of the information has been right on the money and when we trekked all the way down to avenue U to MB Discount Furniture in Brooklyn because the book said it was just about the best place to buy quality furniture, we were not disappointed. Some of the resources they include do seem a little silly (music classes for three month olds?) but the fact such oddities exist here is the reason New York is the most colorful place to raise kids! Worth buying if you live close to the city."
1,A patsy,"Oswald was not the assassin.Jack Ruby worked for Richard Nixon since congressional elections in 1947.JFK received the fatal shot from the FRONT, line anyone can see from the Zapruder movie.12 doctors at Parkland and press secretary stated : ""An EXIT wound in the back of the head.""On the WH tapes (cited by the Watergate commission and by Haldeman in his memoirs), Nixon is famously heardsaying : ""The Warren Commission is the biggest hoax that was ever perpetuated."""
4,Great Stuff,"I'm glad the turtles are back. These figures look great. Could do with more articulation though, hence the 4 stars."
2,No table of contents makes this collection unreadable,"This ebook needs an active table of contents. Without it, reading the stories out of order is impossible. I had to resort to starting at the end of the book to read his later stories."
5,DUCK,"it's a duck :3 perfect size, perfect simple duck. i mainly bought it because i wanted an SCP-1356, but it was difficult to find a plain duck!"
2,Does not squeek,"Not sure why I thought all yellow, rubber duckies would squeek. He is weighted to be stable and not tip over in water but I was a little disappointed that he didn't squeek. Good quality. Exactly as pictured."
2,Not Sure if it's worth it,I can't tell if these pills are doing what they are supposed to do. I probably won't buy again.Nothing wrong with the vendor
4,Nice Book for Gift Giving,"I have always admired the works of M.C. Escher, and this anniversary book is an excellent purchase. It contains most of the amazing illustrations the artist created during his lifetime, along with an excellent biography about the artist. For the price, I would also consider purchasing for gift giving for the upcoming holidays."
3,Atlas pepper mill after thrree months,"Pepper Mill Imports Atlas Pepper Mill, Copper, 9""I have had this pepper mill about three months now, and I have only one complaint. It will only grind fine. No matter what you do. you only have one choice. FINE. The construction and the quality of the product is great...too bad they don't fix that one complaint a lot of other people also seem to encounter in their review."
5,We Own Two,"We were given our first brass pepper mill (the 8"" open bottom version) as a wedding present twenty years ago - they were a bit more exotic back then and harder to find. It has been in continuous service on our dinner table since them. It is indestructible. The oils from the peppercorns keep it lubricated. It is adjustable.My only complaint is that it is slightly (only slightly) awkward grinding pepper into a small bowl for cooking. The rotation of the handle rotates the bottom slightly so you have to hold it tightly in place if you are grinding several tablespoons of pepper into a small bowl.Our solution was to pick up the larger (11"") version with the bottom cup to catch the pepper. The second one stays in the kitchen.We have been giving these pepper grinders as wedding presents ourselves - it is I gift I'm certain they'll use for many, many years!"
3,Brass peppercorn grinder,"Works alright. Grinds the pepper too fine. We would prefer fine to coarse.Has an adjustment screw, but fine and fine is all it adjusts to.Thought it would be a little taller (restaurant style). Overall nice appearance,but would prfer to adjust to coarse."
5,Best peppermill ever,"This 8-inch grinder is great. You can fit an entire bottle of peppercorns in it (at least the Whole Foods Organic-365 I tried). You have to heap some at the end, but the dome top goes over and it fits just fine.The pepper is ground fine and even - I know some other reviews found this an issue, but I think it gives a better distribution of the pepper flavor without grit. Operation is smooth and easy.I plan to buy another in a different finish to use with different pepper.If you need a pepper-mill, you won't be sorry if you get this one."
4,Lots of ground pepper,"Just got this mill after years of just getting by with a tiny pepper ball. This thing is powerful and puts out pepper like a champ. Pretty expensive, for a pepper mill, but I know people who've had a similar one for over 10 years, so its a long term investment. Also of note: metal shavings with your first TBSP of pepper you run through, so be sure not to use it right away! Looks like it should work pretty good."
5,"Gonna leave my wife and run away with ""Atlas"".","Just thought it necessary for those on the fence about this $60 pepper mill; buy it. If you are looking at this I think I know what type of person your are. I.e. a person who wants fresh pepper but is frustrated with inferior mills that break, don't put out enough pepper, or make a grind that varies from large to minuscule. Think of the money dropped $5-15 a pop on hot garbage mills and just suck it up and buy this one. You will not be sorry. FOR LIFE!!!"
3,"If you like course ground pepper, this is not for you.","It seems that I am the only person that likes very course ground pepper these days. I have a Turkish Coffee grinder that I purchased 30 years ago that has a range of fine to very course. I wish I could find another like it, but so far not."
1,Registration Problems,"We tried to install this expansion pack several times. I e-mailed EA Games and they did not return my e-mail. I did call them (NO toll-free telephone number available) and spoke with a very nice man who offered a couple solutions. One solution involved going to the EAGames website and getting a patch ""EA - 1.41 Full Patch"". This did not work. Another solution involved UNinstalling the original Battlefield 2 (with Special Forces), but we were uncertain whether my account would be lost. So we are now returning this expansion pack. Amazon was easy to work with in handling this return. We will probably go to the EAGames website and download the product rather than deal with a CD. It shouldn't be this difficult."
5,Really Great Game,"This is a really great Booster Pack!The additions that come in Armored Fury, including the scout helicopters and the A-10 Warthog, add a lot of fun to the game. The maps in Armored Fury are some of the best I have ever played.In Euro Force there are more really fun maps. Operation Smoke Screen is really fun. If you like to play online, Euro Force helps because the European Union has some weapons that you can unlock online.In all, this Booster Pack adds another dimension to an already fun game. A really Great Buy!!"
3,I hate ea games,"you can't play the single player games until you register this game online, that's a lot of bull poop."
3,Its ok,this took sometime to get working cause EA is a bit odd with registration for this product. it took over a week of talking to costumer service for them to even begin to fix my registration.but afterward it was done and its a decent addon to BF2.
1,EA's Shameful Registration Process,"The Battlefield 2 Booster Pack Collection has a ridiculously complicated registration process. I regret having made the purchase. Potential purchasers should just say ""NO"" to Electronic Arts for treating software customers like this!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I will never buy another product from EA. This ""booster pack"" is nothing more than a few mediocre maps with recycled guns to go along with it. If that was not bad enough, no one actually plays the new maps anyway. You'll be hard pressed to find a game with more than 25 people in it.and to top it off, you need to log onto EA's website to register the packs to ONE ALIAS you have from BF2. So if you and your siblings play, or you have more than one Alias, you can only play any of the bonus content on one of them.Not to mention, EA's website has some serious problems, and out of all of the games I've registered, this one has been by far, hands down, the WORST. It took several tries attempting to get EA to recognize the CD-Key I entered.EA is the devil and gamers should boycott their games."
3,Lack of Content,"There really just wasn't enough added to this to make either of these booster packs worth anyones while, sure there is a new army and you get to fight on American turf but really what does this add to the series? The answer is ""Nothing."""
1,Save your money...,"To call the registration process a nightmare is an act of extreme kindness. I am an IT professional, yet have spent several hours just trying to get the expansion pack to work, without success. Unless you just have nothing to do all day, find a different game."
1,Registration is a bummer,Bought the expansion pack with the hopes of playing some new maps with new weapons and vehicles... but instead I'm been doing the run around trying to register my product. Customer service is trying to be helpful but I still haven't it gotten to work which is crazy. I'd say skip this expansion. You only get a few more weapons and some small maps. I don't see that it's worth the hassel of registering the product.
4,Cute,Got this shirt for my little Chihuahua and it's pretty cute. He seems to like it and he sleeps in it so I'm guessing it's pretty comfortable. The reason it's not 4 stars for me is because its a tad bigger than I thought it would be. But other than that it's great :)
2,Cute but the seller not to good,"I ordered this in small, i received large. I contact the seller, he promise to send me the correct one that almost 6 month ago. So you decide, me i am done with this seller."
4,A valuable resource for KJV students,"Allen and Jacobs' meticulous and thorough transcription of the KJV Translators' annotations to Bishops' Bible sheets is both commendable and serviceable. But disappointing is the omission of matching reproductions of the original sheets, allowing readers a first-hand glimpse of the process."
4,Leaves You Feeling Young And Happy,"I am not often moved by the death of a public figure, but losing Charles Schulz was like losing a member of the family. His Peanuts charactes and the music of Vince Guaraldi were fixtures of my growing up. Remembering George Winston's album ""Linus & Lucy,"" I went out, bought it, and have been enjoying it since. Guaraldi's music brings the antics of the Peanuts gang alive and evokes many fond and happy memories of more simple times. Though not related to Peanuts, the tract entitled ""Monterey"" is equally exceptional. If you're a Peanuts fan -- and who isn't -- turn on this CD, curl up with the Sunday comics and enjoy!"
4,Incredible jazzy tunes take you away.,"George Winston makes over Vince's original works in an incredible fashion in this album. Vince's original works were more smooth, but George has a particular zesty flair of fun that's not quite present in Vince's arrangements. If you enjoyed the Peanuts as a child, this album will bring a myriad of childhood memories (At least for many Gen Xers). The album gets 4 out of 5 mainly because a number of the songs aren't truly as enjoyable to listen to as the ""Masked Baron"" and ""Linus and Lucy"" among other good songs. (email comments welcome)"
5,Great music,I love this stuff. Helps me get through those stressful times when I need a little mental break in a busy day....
5,George Winston captures the spirit of Vince Guaraldi.,"It must be daunting to interpret the music of a jazz legend. However, George Winston's performance resonates with a passion and appreciation for Mr. Guaraldi's songs."
3,Pleasant. Good jazz and blues piano,"Forget the title. The only track on this CD that will remind you of Peanuts is #3, and it's well done and fun to listen to. I've never heard Guaraldi before, but I heard track #7 in a restaurant, and had to have the CD. Not all the tracks are as enjoyable as 7 & 3, but they're all nice. This CD will get light rotation in my collection, and will come out for dinner music next time I have a dinner party."
3,the original is best,Vince Guaraldi...How can anything really compare with the original?Get Vince's recording for the fullest Jazz and multi-instrument effect....Winston's efforts are for the piano listener
2,It was a nice try...,"I had the privilege of attending recitals of many of the 50's and 60's Jazz Legends - before they became household names. It was truly an honor and a blessing to be part of an era that will never come around again. I heard brief notes from this CD and I must agree that Mr. Winston did attempt to captureMr. Guaraldi's timeless expressions, but the this production did not have the same ""golden flow"" as the original."
3,Stick with Vince Guaraldi's Originals,"George Winston should be applauded for paying tribute to one of jazz's most underrated artists. However, his particular piano style is not well suited to interpreting Guaraldi. Perhaps many think so because both men have been unfairly labelled ""easy listening."" However, Winston's chiming piano (classically European with a straight rhythm) simply sounds mechanical when wrapped around Guaraldi's swinging compositions. A good effort, but only a mere shadow of Guaraldi's genius."
5,"Great product, excuse the previously left comment","Excuse the other guy's comments, he's obviously a Pokemon or yugi-oh lover. lol he said he was only lying, but it was kind of funny, how much history he knew about the TMNT.This product is great, always been a TMNT fan sinces the 80's, and this figurine just brings it back. what more can you ask, then a ft size model of my fav turtle raphael. brings back memories. Love the detail on this figure, not so much into the new turtles, but brings a good mix."
4,Experiencing Architecture,"Experiencing Architecture, 2nd EditionIn spite of it's age the book is still like a bible for people interested in architecture and used a lot in education. The language is not too complicated, its not too technical and there are a lot of simple but good illustrations."
2,Not the best book,This book has some info you might find helpful but overall I would not tell a friend to purchase this book.
3,"It's OK, but lacks an access password","When I told Star Tech I couldn't use the NETRS232E1 model because it didn't have an access password, they recommended this one instead. So this one has a 'user' password that allows users to configure the serial port but not the whole box. But it DOESN'T have an access password.I purchased this one used from simparts, and the unit is basically in new condition. It didn't come with the driver CD, but I was able to download it from the Star Tech web site."
3,Decent toy,"Right now, I have Leo, Raph, Shredder, and this foot soldier. I love all of them except for this one. Yes, he has some cool swords and his outfit does impress me, but the fact that I can't even get him to stand on his own is a little distressing. Also, none of these figures can really move all too well, which is acceptable, but the foot soldier is probably the worst of all in this department too. His forearms are always bent 90 degree towards his chest, and all you can do to move them is rotate them. If you look at the enlarged picture of him, you'll see what i mean. Overall, if you're getting some turtles and the shredder, you might as well get this foot soldier, because one bad guy isn't enough for the TMNT, but just don't expect the highest quality of play time with this guy."
5,Take a load off.,"My wife was pregnant with twins and between gravity and the kids, the strain on her belly was getting unbearable. We picked up the cradle and upon first use, she could notice a difference. It helped support the kiddos and eased the stretch of the belly near her upper torso. We did at times have to get creative in hiding the cross straps on her shoulders for wardrobe, but for the most part the cradle was pretty discreet."
5,the best support,"i've tried many different supports, however this is by far the best one. I'm on my feet all day and after my 1st trimester, my back started to hurt. this support is the only one that actually relieves my back pain. I'm able to stand on my feet all day without a problem. highly recomend it!!!!"
3,"good for comfort, bad for fashion","This is a good support garment, but I have to wear something under it so it doesn't dig into my skin. Also, the shoulder straps show with almost any shirt except crew neck. Basically I can't wear it to work with nice shirts, but I can put on a tank top, then the cradle, and then a T-shirt over it and it's great for running around on the weekends."
5,A must have for moms having twins,"I have two sets of twins and used this with my second pregnancy. It looks complicated, but it isn't. The straps on the shoulders did show if I wore a shirt with a really wide neck, but I didn't care. It did make my back hurt a little at first, but I think it was because I have crappy posture and this helped me with that. After those first couple days, it helped my back instead of hurting it. I wish I would have had this the first time around too."
1,Not sized correctly,"When I purchased this I was not even in the weight range. I am now 5lbs into the weight range and it is too tight. The other issue is that I am petite and the straps on the side are too long. While it relieves some pressure off my lower back I feel more pain in my upper back. I don't like it and could not recommend it, especially if you are a petite person. Also you have to safety pin it to your bra so that it is not exposed out of your top. Besides wearing a regular round neck t-shirt there are no other tops/sweaters/blouses you can wear with the cradle unless you pin down the straps."
5,Super tool for twin pregnancy,"After reading the reviews saying it runs on the small side, I bought a size large. I am (gasp) 223 lbs now at 25 weeks pregnant with twins. It fits OK, I would even say a bit loose. I am still using the middle set of hooks at the bottom - there is definitely room to grow for me, so it should work for me all the way through the end.I wear the cradle every time I know I will be on my feet a lot (when I go for a walk to exercise, for example). It does help a lot as it alleviates the strain on the round ligaments.The top straps do show from under every V-neck and even under some crew necks but I am OK with it if it means there is no pain for me.Great item overall!"
3,Never could get too comfy.,"I ordered this during my twin pregnancy but found it too tight in places and never wore it much. Plus I was embarrassed by how it would show under my clothing. Maybe if I'd had to be on my feet more, I'd have liked it better."
4,A wonderful product,"This is an excellent product. I had been feeling very heavy in my second pregnancy and my doctor suggested this product. Even with all the positive reviews, I wasn't really a believer. Once I figured out all the straps and placed it on, it really worked wonders. I feel like I can go about my very busy and active day now and rarely do I feel discomfort or heaviness anymore. The only reason why I'm giving it four stars is because the cross body straps really do show themselves, making it virtually impossible to wear anything. I have been wearing the same sweatshirt to cover the straps for months now but I guess that's the trade off for comfort. I am a very small woman but do please listen to the reviews and buy a MEDIUM or one size larger than your average size. I'm usually a size 2/4 so the medium works perfectly. A really great thing to have. One less thing to worry about as you progress in your pregnancy. This is truly wonderful!"
1,Waste of money!,"Most uncomfortable thing I put on during pregnancy. Did not help my back while I was carrying twins, but instead caused pain in other places. Not recommended at all."
2,"I don't get it (also, not for big boobs!)","perhaps I'm not big enough in the belly yet, but it doesn't exclude me from needing some support. I found that my 5'2"" 36HH short and curvy frame (size 14 during pregnancy) didn't get any support from this. the straps around the chest were tight and cut into my chest. the belt itself was too big under my belly even on the tightest settings. Bummer, I was looking forward to a belt with support that also let me sit easily. Also, it pinched my bump in a weird way making it look like a saggy beer belly rather than a kid. :( Luckily Amazon makes returns easy."
2,Didn't fit,"The straps that go along your ribs and between your breasts were REALLY tight! The part that fits under your belly didn't fit me until I was 6 months pregnant and I'm carrying twins. The fit of this thing was really strange to me since I weighed 120 lbs before pregnancy and my upper body is pretty small. The only part of me that seems really big is my belly and that is the part of the prenatal cradle that was loose. My midwife recommended this and I've heard from other woman that they loved theirs, so maybe it just wasn't for me:)"
2,Helpful for back support but not wearable as white fabric shows,I got it and was really excited to use for my back support as I reached 8 months pregnancy. But it's really annoying to wear it and try to cover it with turtle necked sweater all the time. Otherwise the white belt will show up around my neckline. Not sure if other people have the same issue. Can you imagine If you use it during the summer? Don't know how you can hide it!!! Had to take a loss to return it because it's unbearable!
4,Prenatal Cradle,This belt was difficult to take on and off (or at least more than I wanted to deal with). Once I had it on it was comfortable and lifted my belly to relieve pressure from my pelvic area/hips/legs. I did end up returning it because of the straps in front that criss cross. I was not able to wear any shirts that didn't go up to my neck without showing off the straps.
1,hot and itchy,I am a waitress and 8 months pregnant. My Dr. recommended this product to relieve back pain and discomfort due to my expanding waistline(haha) It looked promising but upon arrival I tried it on and instantly it was itchy and uncomfortable. The next day I tried to wear it to work with a tank top underneath to help with the itchiness. I took it off within the first 10 minutes of work.My two year old now wears it around the house. I do not recommend this product.
5,Great support!,I am pregnant with twins so there is a lot of pressure on my back. This cradle helps to support my tummy and takes weight off the back.
3,sizing was all wrong,"I am 29 weeks and I work on stand on my feet for work at least five shifts a week. By hour 3 or 4, my back is killing me. At the end of the day, I get some intense contractions, so I sought this out after reading about it in Baby Bargains. I want to love it, but it's way too big. Pre-pregnancy I was at least a 16/18 or XL/XXL. I wear a medium or large at Motherhood/Pea in the Pod in pants and large or XL in tops (baby is all hips and up - have lost weight). On the tightest/smallest setting, the large is WAY TOO LARGE. TOO LARGE as in feels the same as my pants panel's. I'm not even sure a medium would be small enough? I may have ordered the wrong size prenatal cradle, but I followed their guidelines; I was worried the large would be too small. Disappointed that I need to return it, and that I had to buy one from Motherhood out of desperation."
2,Prenatal Cradle,It's a little uncomfortable. I guess because I am carrying so low. AND I wish it had more than three adjustable places. I CAN tell a difference after I have worn it. I bought it on my OB/GYN's recommendation. See what your Dr says before you spend the money.
2,The failure of the general approach,"In surveying the overall history of the Jewish people one should have some sense of its overall direction and meaning. One should too give the reader a real sense of the transformations through various periods. One should also have a sense of the centrality of Israel, and the significance of the Jewish return to sovereignty.This collection is lacking all these elements. While it contains many fine individual essays as an overall work it just does not hang together. Previous collections of essays on Jewish history as a whole, one thinks of the great Ben- Sassoon anthology are far superior to this one."
4,comb brush,purchased the mebro pocket brush and have been very happy with comb.combs hair easily without pulling. it was a good purchase.
4,Tiny Bradshaw,"These sides are all King recordings from 1950-52. Not all are essential tracks, but one, ""T-99,"" makes the CD worth acquiring. It's a terrific song, and I find this recording one of the very best in the post-war R&B era. For that track alone, the CD's a keeper."
2,Not Original Artists,"The selection of songs is fine, but they are not performed by the original artists. It might be okay if any of the renditions were better, or at least innovating upon the originals. No such luck."
3,Wonderful Book!,"I love to read stories about people in the Holocoust. I've read stories about Corrie Ten Boom, but I like this one the best. Read this book!!!!"
4,Do not take the bolt ALL the way out!!,"I stripped the bolt trying to fit it around my battery terminal, completely my fault, but do NOT take the bolt out. Otherwise, 3 connect points for my positive power, amplifier, and my BIG 3 connection. Great product!!"
4,Great battery terminal,"I know that Monster is often thought of as medium quality stuff that tries to pass itself off as premium quality stuff at a premium price. But this battery terminal really is premium quality. At least if you are looking for a ring-terminal type of terminal. If you want a direct wire attachment, then you'll need to look elsewhere. But for a ring terminal type unit, this can't be beat.I have just one quibble, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5: it is advertised as ""slimline"", which it is -- or would be, if the cover was shorter. The cover is way too tall for a ""slimline"" product, with 1/4"" to 3/8"" spare space. This isn't a problem for my installation. But, if it is going to call itself slimline, then, it needs to have a slimline cover.I did, however, buy the product on sale locally for $20, which is less than Amazon's price."
4,"A little ""louder"" in person","They don't look as bright in this picture as they are in real person. I'm not usually one of the guys who wear really stand out colors and these were a little on the flashy side. They feel good and i can move smoothly in them. A good shoe for the money, I'd still recommend them to someone who does'nt mind standing out a little bit."
3,Wait Your Turn,"I purchased this movie because my son is in it. I had followed the production and wanted to see the final show pulled together. It was and ok 1st attempt, but the story-line, acting and directing need much improvement.bw"
2,Low Budget,"This movie is great if you really love the message and are no movie critic at all.I'm personally ok with low budget movies as long as the message is right and there are not too many errors (I like to watch the store regardless of the acting).With that being said, this movie had too many errors for me to enjoy. It had a good message of waiting until marriage to have sex butThe lead actors were ok but I wasn't expecting the poor sound quality in outdoor scenes, poor scripting/acting in some scenes and I don't even know what happened with the dubbing.Watch the movie for the message but even Flywheel with their low-budget was much better put together."
3,NOT THE BEST MAGNET,"I purchased this because of all of the praise on the review page, and now I wish I hadn't. It lacks the clear hard hitting sound that drew me to the later stuff( like Dopes.. and Power Trip). Most of the tracks could pass for the same long song if all the spaces in between were removed. If you want something that truly rocks and is hard to remove from your stereo, go with anything from Superjudge on up. I love Monster Magnet, but I was not impressed with their first effort. I thought maybe it would grow on me with extended listening, but its not happening. So if you like MM's later stuff, think twice before you buy this one."
5,Great rendition of the classic,"First, this is not the strings version made famous by Samuel Barber in the film Platoon. This is a combo strings and choral version that I find to be even more emotional, this version I believe was actually more well known for being the title song for the 1999 pc game Homeworld, where it is used to show the horror and sadness as your home planet is bombarded and wiped out.No complaints about sound quality, not to much base (the song lacks low notes, mostly mids to highs, though I think I hear a cello as well)Im not a music expert by far, but I love this."
4,Growing up and Growing Pains,"This is a continuation of the character Alice from the author Phyllis Naylor. In this book Alice is about to go off to Camp Overlook to be a counselor. She has just finished her freshman year of high school. The book chronicles her time at the campwith her friends Gwenn, Elizabeth and Pamela and the little girls who they are responsible for. Alice has to deal with her brother Lester moving out and her father's fiancee Sylvia cancel their wedding because her sister got sick. In this book you really feel like not only do you know Alice in person but you can feel when she is disappointed or hurt. A great read an another hit for the Alice series."
3,Okay....not the best,"I am a HUGE fan of the Alice books, but I guess I was a little disappointed with this one. It seemed like the author was just randomly throwing in problems to make the book interesting...but the problems were all fixed by the end of the book. It really bugged me how the wedding was postponed (problem #500) and all of a sudden it was like, ""Oh, okay, we'll just hold the wedding in October...problem solved :)."" I was hoping that some of the problems would continue into the next book so that everyone would just be hanging until the book was in stores. All in all, this Alice book was good, but not up to the usual standards. Wait 'till it comes out in paperback."
5,What more could you want?!!,"This novel has the best (and worst) of the human experience. Hugo has taken the basest emotions and displayed them in Medieval Paris. It is complex and so unlike the Disney version that it is a shame they share the same name. I recommend this book to anyone interested in a wonderful, sad, exciting, tear-jerking story that will never leave you. You'll find yourself pushing other people to read this classic and you'll never discover your copy shoved in the back of the bookcase behind the gardening books!"
4,"Depressing, yet necessary","I love Hugo and had just come off reading Les Miserables. Then I picked this one up and when I finished it I was depressed for a week. It is so incredibly tragic. If you're depressed or can't take hard reality don't read this book. It is beautiful, but so so depressing!"
4,"Except for a few digressions, a good read","This book reads like an opera - big themes, unrequited love, a disfigured protagonist, and unrealistic situations. In the end, I have to say it is a really good book. Be warned, however, that there are a couple of chapters that could literally be thrown away without anyone ever noticing. Hugo has a nasty habit of digressing for about 30 or 40 pages at a time. You've got to just grit your teeth and plow through those sections, the rest of the book is worth it."
3,A rather grusome story that shows the reader medieval life.,"This book, I must say, is nothing like I expected it to be. I thought it would focus on the life of the Hunchback, Quasimodo, but instead it looked at the lives of many unfortunate people along the way. Most of the characters are rather sad people; A gypsy girl taken advantage of by a crude soldier; a lustful deacon gone mad; a lonely bell ringer persecuted by the mobs of Paris; a poet/philosopher broke and homeless. I had expected, well, brighter, different characters and storylines. One this I found amazing about this story, however, was the shading of the characters. I expected the villain, Claude Frollo, to be black-hearted. Instead, at parts he was almost a shade of gray. Note of caution: I would not recommend this book to children. Yes, Disney made a movie out of it, but the true tale is not one for youngsters. The entire story, especially the end, is too sand and dark for young readers to enjoy"
3,read Les Miserables,"I did like this book, when I eventually persuaded myself I had to read it, but some parts were unnecessarily and tediously descriptive. I really didn't want to know about every stone in Notre Dame de Paris. A shorter description would still create the right atmosphere. I haven't seen the Disney version, but I have the idea it's a happy ending film, and I don't think that suits the book."
4,Hugo's commentary on the death penalty,"This novel was written as an argument against the death penalty. The victim was a young, naive innocent girl caught at the wrong place at the wrong time. She was falsely charged by an overzealous prosecutor, then condemned to death for a crime that didn't even take place!After being rescued by Quasimoto and hiding from the crowds, the King, thinking the mob wanted her hanged, ordered her death, with no knowledge or even any interest in her situation. Thus, she was murdered.I never previously paid much attention to the debates charging that the death penalty should be abolished, nor did I understand the reasons. I must say, however, that as hard as it was for me to read this book, (I'm not experienced at reading the classics) it changed my mind and made me see the problems with the death penalty."
2,Best reason in the world for Editors,"This is a rambling and boring work about fifteenth century Paris, and the story of the Hunchback, the cabalistic Abbot, Esmeralda and Captain Phoebus forms only a small component of this excess of verbage. There was never a better reason for abridged versions than the full text of this book. Read a shortened version, see the movie anything, but don't put yourself through the torture of reading this. I did, and as a result I have developed a hunch on my own back from cringing at the sheer volume of absolutely pointless prose."
2,not for young children,"This is not a book you should have a young reader read on their own. Though the writing is at their level (2nd-4th grade) the content is not. I can appreciate that it is a classic tale that shows the life and characters of the age in which the story is set, it is not something you want your child reading on their own. It shows the cruelty of people, the evil darkness of others and then ends in a hopeless tragedy. Though an adult can understand the complexity of the tragedy and find a sad beauty in it, not a child of this age range, on their own. I would only recommend this book as a read aloud. My daughter was very upset by the ending and I regret giving her the book to read. She is 8."
5,Everything Has Its Meaning,Hugo's connection of inner beauty between the Cathedral and Quasimodo's captures the main theme in one small box. This is a great novel for anyone who loves to see symbolism used throughout a novel.
5,Descend into a heart of darkness,"This is a brilliant, brilliant book. It is as damning an indictment of Christianity in the late Middle Ages as I have ever read. The book is really about Claude Frollo, the priest tormented by lust for a ""low"" gypsy girl. What might have been a love story turns to madness, obsession, betrayal and death as Frollo is destroyed by the morality he has accepted. Of course, he does not die alone."
4,Hunchback book,"The book itself is ine ""like-new"" condition and shipping was fast. My slight disappointment is that I did not see that it was unabridged. When I realized that - after receiving it - I was not quite as happy, but I suppose I did not research that enough. however, I do wish that sellers would make that information VERY NOTICABLE!"
3,Classic checked off my list,"Okay, so I read it. It was long and pretty much depressing. Maybe it just went right over my head. The character Quasimodo was fascinating. I definitely enjoyed that aspect of the book."
3,"Good, but not great.","Good quality workmanship, durable as the very first Eccos were not. Very comfortable except as follows. I previously bought a pair of the old style walkathons an issue with non-breathable shoes. This first pair were unrivaled as far as breathability-I have never owned a more comfortable shoe. Even the lining was comfortable. By comparison, the new Walkathons feel like plastic bags on your feet. There not bad shoes by any means, and I may represent a small percentage of potential customers. But I gotta call'em the way I see 'em."
5,Wow! This is LOUD!!!,This color is so awesome for summer and a day at the beach! I wear this on my toe nails when I just want to liven my feet up. Such a cool and electric color! I like this one!
5,"not so ""orange""","I want to buy a bright orange for my coming spring break. I saw the picture and I bought it immediately. It arrived on time but the color is kind of ""orange-red"". Anyway, it is a bright color."
4,confusing catalog entry: Caveat emptor,"Caveat Emptor. The image supplied is that of the fine and handsomely produced Harry Abrams edition, but the details of the description are for a much cheaper low quality knockoff of this fine book. The early issues of this book have very high quality tipped in color plates. The original book lacks a date and has no ISBN (it has an SBN, but if you prepend the 0 as normally suggested, you will find it refers to a completely different title.) The short of it is that if you order from this data, you may or may not get what you want. If you want a specific edition, I suggest that you contact the seller before you order."
1,puhleezzzeee,"Christopher Makos is proof that you don't need talent to bang out a career in photography. Besides being reviled in much of the fashion world and completely dismissed by the art world, Makos's photos are tired, old-fashioned pin-ups of handsome men. Don't confuse the beauty of the subjects for any sort of vision from the ""artist."" Calvin Klein's contribution does not save this mediocre effort. save your money."
1,Leaks water all over the place! &*%#$!!!!!!,"I have been anxious for such a device for a long time. I want hot strong espresso made in my office and not a bulky countertop model. The first time ever I used this, I used 'untamped' Illy espresso. Once hot the pressure started shooting hot water out the base of the bottom pot. (It was not the joining gasket area.)Now that the pressure had broke whatever was holding it together in the first place the water leaks out just by gravity.I will have to return this one and hope for a better made one but I suspect it is poor design and others will also fail.In the meantime I am back to drinking the office swill.#$&$#^$% the people that made this item!"
4,2 years later & I'm still using it everyday!,"I have been using this for over 2 years and it is fantastic. I used to drink a pot of coffee in the morning and needless to say, I had some predictable side effects. I was constantly running to the bathroom, my stomach was queasy, I got frequent headaches and was jittery, not to mention the time it takes to drink that much coffee. Now I drink a pot of this a day (equivalent to an ample cup of coffee) and experience none of the above. Just for the record, mine has a 10 shot capacity. It simply improved my quality of life. A lot to say about a small pot! Espresso experts will scoff at calling it ""espresso"" since it won't meet their brewing standards, but for those of us out there that are NOT experts and want to ""get up and go"" in the morning, then this is the one for you! Just one tip - pack the grounds loosely and don't overfill it with espresso grounds or it will spurt, spew and sputter."
3,"Great Coffee Maker, but . . .","I usually make my espresso with a stove-top espresso maker, which makes excellent espresso. I got this for when I wanted to make more espresso, take it on trips, etc. The only problem is, it doesn't make very good espresso. That's why I call it a ""coffee maker."" I think it turns out a few good cups of coffee, but the taste cannot be compared with my little stove-top espresso maker - it just doesn't taste like espresso, and the texture is a little thick. I use it, and enjoy it, but not every day. I will say though, for those who like it, it works well in making iced coffee."
3,Good while it lasted,"I was very happy with this machine for the year I had it. The machine was easy to operate and clean, and I thought the espresso was quite good considering the price of the machine. My major gripe is that the machine only lasted a little more than one year before the electrical system gave out."
4,Great diaper for newborns,"I have used cloth diapers on my son since he came home from the hospital (now 13 mos) and these were great when he was a newborn. They fit in the newborn size diaper covers better than prefolds when folded in half lengthwise, then in half widthwise, then in thirds. We used them with Bumkins covers. We had to put them away for the next baby when my son was about three months old, but despite their short shelf life they were very valuable those first few months because the trimmer fit allowed the poly diaper covers to do the important job of containing messy newborn poo! I am considering getting them back out to use as doublers in the pocket diapers we now use for overnight...if I can only find them...Highly recommended for preemies and infants 0 - 3 months. I suggest buying two dozen if you plan to cloth diaper exclusively."
3,Not as good as Nina Simone Remix . . .,"We got this because we were so happy with the Nina Simone remix. We felt it was a great light manipulation of Nina's music, but Nina Simone's music remained the focus of the disk, whereas the Billy Holiday remix seems to be more about the DJ or the remix, or the something, but a lot of the soul of the BIlly Holiday music is lost. It is still a good CD, 6 or 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, but it isn't as nice as the Nina Simone of the same name."
2,"Adds nothing, detracts mostly","This album is just a cut and paste job. There is a lot of extra production which adds nothing to the original recording and obscures the talent of Ms Holiday. A couple of tracks work because they enhance the mood of the original without totally deconstructing it, but mostly this is a travesty best forgotten."
1,Deserves a minus scale rating,"Unfortunately, I have ordered this CD after some favorable review.I cannot believe this horrid concoction could be rated appealing. You better listen to the original recordings (I certainly will) instead of volunteering for a nauseating treatment from the mindless machine jamming that dominates each (!!!) number.What a loss.I wish I could claim damages."
4,Inspiring.,"Beautifully reinterpreted Billie Holiday classics. The DJ Logic, Jazzeem and Organica remixes are particularly good. My only complaint is that the vinyl does not include a code to download a digital version of the songs - something that should be pretty much standard for vinyl records nowadays. Otherwise, five stars."
1,I hate what Sony has done to Billie's work,"It wasn't what I thought it would be like! I now know that tampering with, Billie Holiday's work, is a sin!!If Billie could hear this mess she would turn over in her grave. Billie Holiday remixed&reimagined;, sorry to say is, REGRETFUL!!! I wish I could return it for double refund for spencing my time listening to it!!"
1,Dismal,I'm not ashamed to admit that I like some of Verve's jazz remixes. Granted I have to swallow hard since I'm a roots sort of guy. But this is just horrible from beginning to end. Everything that is Billie is simply buried. An abomination.
2,Buggy and Broken,"The one I got has a poor-quality DVD player; it keeps skipping and hanging on brand new out-of-the-box DVDs. Plus after a year the remote control sensor in the TV itself broke and had to be replaced - out of warranty, of course.Other than that the picture is sharp and clear, the sound is excellent, the on-screen controls are excellent, and the remote control is well-laid out and easy to use. I'm just knocking it down 3 stars because of the remote control sensor problem and the mediocre integral DVD player."
3,can't run cable/DSS box w/remote,"Having a TV combo with a remote that can run my DSS box is very important to me. A previous review states that ""you can run TV/DVD/VCR and most cable/DSS with the Panasonic remote"".This appears to not be true. Although I didn't buy this TV, I did download the owner's manual, and there is nothing there that indicates that the Panasonic remote will work with a cable or DSS box. So if needing only one remote control to operate everything is important to you, you might want to keep looking."
2,Painful to use,"We got this as a replacement for the fax we had in our office. We do get a lot of faxes, and I will say the quality of print is good. Also the printing is quick.HOWEVER, the tray is somewhat difficult to load. It takes forever to start the fax, and if you walk away thinking the fax has gone through, you will probably come back to find out it did not!It cannot run more than 2 fax jobs at a time. Tonight I had 3 pieces of paper to send to 3 different places. It took me 10 minutes.The buttons are not intuitive. There are 46 buttons on this machine and you could be staring at them for hours if you are not familiar with it.The next time I get a machine, I am getting just the fax and leaving all the fancy stuff like copying and scanning for machines that are built for it."
2,Does not works on mac,"The bundle software does not install in Leopard. I need to make a ""customizable"" install...In package, open ""install"" folder, ctrl+click in HP Installer and select show packagego to Contents\Sub Installers folder, and make a manual install of all packages."
1,Poor network printer,"If you want a printer that stays online, don't bother with this one. Everytime I need to print something, I need to shut the printer down, as well as my computer, to get a print-out. I've had it. I can't understand why technology that has been around for so long can't be made to work by a company with so much experience."
1,Not compatible with Windows Vista,"This printer worked great when I bought it and was running Windows XP. I upgraded to Windows Vista and the printer will no longer scan documents and frequently only prints the top half of pages. HP support is useless - many of their troubleshooting solutions refer only to Windows XP and earlier versions. The available Vista drivers have no effect on the funtion. A review of on-line forums indicates many users have this same problem. If you have Vista, stay away from this printer."
1,Junk--Buy something else,"Purchased about 9 months ago, and one of my print heads just failed. A replacement is $80 so I'm going to look elsewhere--this printer has taken years off my life it is such a failed engineering design experiment! I've had problems with the scanner (both getting it to connect and physically the scanner mechanism falling apart). Consistently scans ""crooked"" when fed in the document feeder; occasionally misses pages. THIS PRINTER IS A PROBLEM. PLEASE BUY SOMETHING ELSE AND SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE."
2,Duplex attachment constantly jams...,The duplex feature on this printer worked exactly once. It jams at the same spot every time now. HP online help is a joke. Finding a phone number to call was very difficult. It's also noisy. A definite step backwards from my previous model which has been discontinued. Oh well.
2,Don't believe the ink usage stats from HP,"Like several other reviewers, I have found that the ink costs are several times higher than what is claimed in the HP literature. If you print more than a couple of hundred pages a month, this thing will hurt you. GO WITH A COLOR LASER.Pros--print qualityCons--ink cost, mediocre paper handling, inefficient automatic software update downloads, tech support seems to come with a different nationality every time I call, and I get very diverse opinions reflecting diverse tech support sources."
2,Avoid if you can,"Worked fine, until I needed to feed from the ADF-Jammed every time, could not get to work. Then 35 days after I bought it, and put in a new black ink, said all 3 colors were missing or bad. After three online chats with mostly incompetent HP techs, I have to return it, pay 79.99 for a 3 year warranty, so I can avoid an overnight charge.. Not that any technology item works perfectly, but you would think a product work work perfectly out of the box for at least awhile. And the cost of the #88 ink, well we won't go there....Update: After getting replacement printer-Discovered that the only problem was-the printer was out of ink-yes, just out of ink. Strange that three tech support people could not detect that, along with the warning not saying it was out of ink, but missing ink..."
1,Ink cartridge cost outragous,"I consider this product a pure consumer fraud, they should warn us this high upkeep cost and develop reasonable priced replacement for the ink."
1,"As ""Taps"" plays softly in the background...?","Reading these reviews, I can't help but think of them as HP's online funeral.I didn't buy this same model, but another HP Officejet around the same time as the rest of these folks, and had basically their same experience. Like many of them, I had been purchasing HP printers without a second thought, researching only enough to decide which model met my needs this time, for decades. The last one was indeed the last one. HP will never redeem itself in my eyes.Once the mighty have fallen, it's a long hard climb back..."
1,Don't waste your money,"Put simply I have two major issuesd:1. Ink is dated and it will not let you use it past the date without a lot of cancels, retries, etc. I've read where it also will measure your usage by time rather than use so sometimes when it says you are out of ink, you are not.2. Never could get the scanner feeder to work. Many complaints about this on the web and despite updating drivers, etc several times, still no go.I'm going to buy a cannon or other after reading more reviews. I have HP computers and like them but their printers have gone down the tubes."
1,Buy with caution,"I have had this printer less than six months and it has been replaced twice. I received the last one last week and it still isn't working correctly. I would recommend finding another printer, this one is terrible with lots of problem that can't seem to be corrected when you call hp"
1,Leaks Ink,"I had a problem with the printer leaking ink. I have never used the printer, having bought the unit for the scanner and fax. After a couple of days the printer reported that the black cartridge was empty and had to be replaced. A week later it was reporting that the yellow cartridge was in the same state."
5,Great product for the price,"I have gone through a few printers. For work, I do a lot of printing. This printer has lasted longer than most so far, and it's still going. It prints fast, and good quality prints. The display screen is nice. Setup is fairly simple. It's very user friendly. I love the USB slots. Only complaint - I have to set my margins smaller than I have in the past. For some reason it doesn't print to the far left side of the page. I've messed around to figure out why and can't find a reason, or solution. Not a huge problem, I only have to adjust to about 1/4 inch of the page. I think this printer is the best deal for it's price range."
1,"Recurring ""paper jam"" without paper!","I bought this to replace another HP all in one product that served me well. First printer showed up with ink cartridges in place - I should have been suspicious. During setup, before any paper was inserted, I kept getting a ""paper jam"" error instructing me to remove the rear duplexer. After dozens of tries and a call to HP, it was determined that the printer indeed had a ""hardware problem"". Printer was swapped out the next day. I have now spent another hour trying to set up the darn(!) thing & I am receiving the same error. Really, can it be me? Now I see that other reviewers had the same exact problem. Even if I can resolve it, it's going back. I don't need a high-maintenance office product that is going to fail when I need it most. So disappointing!"
4,Nice little machine,"Does all it claims. Prints quickly. Inkjet cartridges go fast. Quality of prints, even photos is excellent."
1,The Worst Printer Ever Built!!!!,I purchased this printer believeing it was a reliable commercial grade printer. Boy was I wrong. It loves to jam up whenever a paper with even the slightest bend goes through it. After owning it for 2 weeks it malfunctioned and began spitting out junk. I spent over 6 hours with tech support and they were completely unhelpfull. I emailed amazon and they were happy to send me a new one. I accepted their kind offer.After another month I'm saddend to say this one is spitting out junk as well. I found out this problem is becoming common with these models. I'm returning this one and I will buy something else. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it.
1,Poor Scanning Software,"So disappointing. I had the earlier HP 3020 and it worked great. Then I got Leopard on my Mac, and discovered that it wouldn't work. So I got this machine based on its great reviews. The scans are basic. 1) You cannot rotate the document, page by page. 2) You cannot add to the scanned document by adding pages after the initial scan, or using the feeder for some pages and the flatbed for others."
1,Another example of overly-complicated Chinese-made garbage....,"Bought this printer one month ago, and I am completely disgusted. I use an IMAC, and the printer is networked with Airport Extreme, which was a trial. It prints photos on slick photo paper with dark lines left beween sweeps of the printer heads. Have already tried realigning print heads repeatedly. I have been on the phone with HP support, and they want to charge me for help. Continually misfeeds paper, which requires opening the cover to correct. Once you clear the jam and close the cover, you must wait for the printer to complete and run through a maddeningly lengthy (45+ seconds!!) rumination of self-tests and gyrations -- we joked that it brings to mind an obnoxious dog slurping away at its you-know-what.I have owned several HP printers, and they have been durable and trouble free. This however, will be the last HP product I buy."
1,HP is now GARBAGE,"I have been a HP supporter for many years, and finally replaced an old VERY reliable printer because I couldn't get the ink cartridges anymore. The new Office Jet Pro has been NOTHING BUT a headache!!! I have to date spent over 14 hours on the phone/on line with customer service. It has 2 issues. First it wont communicate with my plain-old normal W XP. After multiple software patches it will do everything BUT fax from my computer.Issue #2, it keeps telling me that the ink cartridges are empty, they have been replaced 5 TIMES!!!!Won't buy HP again."
2,"Digital filing NG, media slots NG. Do not be tempted by the specs.","Impressive specs but they are only specs.Digital filing does not work properly. It will save corrupt pdf files. No error messages.Media slots will read OK for printing pictures, but again, digital scanning to he media is not reliable.Contacting HP support is something out of the twilight zone. A waste of time.It seems the ""firmware"" shipped with this AiO is not fully tested. This is a ""beta"" printer from HP. You will pay $300+ for the privilege to be a product tester for HP :-)"
1,OCR stops working after OS upgrade,"The printer performed adequately up until the point I upgraded the MAC OS to 10.6. The OCR stopped working, and after useless attempts at communicating via e-mail, an hour waiting on the help line, they informed me that OCR software is not theirs, and I can buy it elsewhere for a $100. Nowhere on their web site does it state that the software will stop working if you upgrade the OS, the information that is there is incorrect. DO NOT buy the printer - the support makes it unusable."
2,Bad printer,"It jams too often and you cannot get to the jammed paper easily, it tells you its out of ink when it isn't, it won't print in black & white when yellow ink is low, ink is very expensive, the document feeder is unreliable, but the print quality is good. Now if only the rest of it was, but I wonder if there are any good, reliable printers out there at all?"
2,Avoid HP printers with Vivera Ink,Unfortunately this uses the vivera ink from HP. If it gets damp (eg. you are sweaty any you pick up the printout) it runs.
1,Ink not waterproof and fades quickly,"The Vivera inks (#88) for the OfficeJet L7680 multifunction are highly touted by HP. What is NOT mentioned is that they are not water resistent (nevermind waterproof) and smudge easily with even damp hands. Further, rather that being ""archival"" the colors fade quickly, in mere months exposed to flourescent lighting. The unit itself works fine but do not even think about it for photo printing and think twice about using it for normal color business printing if you plan on handing it out to customers. It's way past the 30 days I can return now, but I would send it back if I could."
1,What a horrible experience,"Got our 7680 in June. First impression was that the printing and copying (which we use 95% of the time) were good quality. The machine makes all kinds of clicking and clacking noises at startup, and the startup time is long. Three months in, and we got a paper jam we couldn't fix. Technical Support in India was difficult to understand, and after 1.75 hours, gave up and sent us another machine. Machine #2 had a fax hardware failure during installation. Again, Tech support spent another 1.5 hours, gave up and sent machine #3. Machine #3 had the same fax hardware failure. Our ""Case Manager"" sent us a ""sister"" model (#7780), and guess what? - Same fax failure. We can't be the only customers who've reported this fax issue, but HP swears we're the only ones...We're so fed up, we don't know whether to send all four machines back for a refund, or just be lazy, keep the machine and buy a separate fax machine somewhere else. HP has lost me as a customer."
1,printer jams,"If I try to print a single page with two-sided checked (my default printer setting), it always jams. I can't return this quick enough."
1,Don't buy this printer,"I bought this printer about 2 years ago and it's been nothing but problems. Right out of the box there was a problem with the power supply. After spending a few hours on the phone with different gentlemen from India, they finally agreed to send me a new power supply.It worked good for a few months but then started getting a constant error that the back door was open. Apparently this is a common problem with no solution. I cleaned the connectors many times and it would print 10 pages and then say the door was open.Also the drivers are poorly written. I go to print 50 pages and it will print them out of order - or print 1/2 page on one piece of paper and then the other 1/2 on another piece of paper.I paid a premium for this printer because i thought I was buying a quality product. That was definitely not the case!!!"
1,lousy reliability,"I've had to replace this printer 3 times so far (on warranty). It wil not print if any of teh cartridges are out of ink (it would be nice if it woudl still print something). Currently, it is telling me ""the ink cartrige is not intended for use in this computer"" with an HP almost-full cartridge I've ben printing off of for 3 months. Hmmmmmm. It also goes through a lot of ink unless you set it to use black ink only, a bit of a pain to turn on and off every time you need to print in color. In general I have very little positive to say about teh printer--oh, I like the scanning feature."
1,Junk I hate HP,"I am amazed at what a jamming, noisey, cheaply made, piece of junk this is.Any satisfied reviewer is delusional."
1,I'd show zero stars,"...If I had the choice. I have had trouble with jams and failures to feed straight, and multiple feeds nearly since the day I got it. It is a bad design. It also does not come anywhere near the cost per page that they show in their ads. I do mainly 50 page booklets, grey scale, two sided. Anything that interrupts the print order tends to make the whole booklet unusable. Waste of paper significant.Crowning blow: it fell apart in my hands as I tried to clear yet another jam. Sent info to HP. Asked for drawing so I could at least put it back together properly. Their answer was for me to buy a new 8500 from them. BUT, the prices offered by them were above even the prices THEY are advertising on their own website, let alone the prices here and other places.I think I need to go to another manufacturer.Rick in Olympia"
1,ADF defective,"bought this to replace 2-year old hp 7310. was hesitant at first because i noticed the ADF mechanism looks the same as hp 7310. 7310 ADF skips pages when faxing muliple pages. the occurance is random at first, then it's all the time -- cleaning didn't help.anyways, after setting up the L7680, the same issue arise on the second fax. returned it within the first week. going to try brother mfc-9440 -- watch for my review on it."
4,It works for me!,"This is the only product I found that allows you to dump a scanned image directly to a network folder with just pressing 2 buttons (i.e., after setting the network connection up). And it does this pretty fast - in less than a minute. Even true when I scanned 4 photos at a time at its 600dpi max resolution setting and I am pleased with the images. I would have given this 5 star had not the first box arrived with a defective network port, which Amazon promptly replaced. Hopefully, this printer would last long."
1,Don't buy anything HP,If you buy an HP expect nothing in customer support. I would never buy this product or any other HP product again. I gave it one star because it was required.
2,Casio Illuminator sports watch (ladies'),"Just what I wanted for size, strap, and light (the picture shows these accurately) - but it takes several graduate degrees to figure out how to use the time and alarm set functions."
5,Great travel bag,I bought this for my 9 year old nephew and he loved it. Sturdy enough for a boy his age. He's going to use as a carryon when they go to florida soon.
4,Ut bag,Awesome bag for a UT fan! Thought it would be a little bigger but still very nice. Perfect for a gym bag or an overnight bag.
4,Great bag!,This bag is great. The only negative thing I would say is the gold can sometimes appear to be a greenish color.
4,Longhorn Carryall,"Sturdy, good color, easily recognizable for the logo. I really like the the shoe space being seperate and large enough to hold my size 14."
1,didnt get what i ordered,I ordered the arkansas razorbacks gym bag and it WASNT what i ordered! I got the bag and it is completely differnt then the picture. It only had the razorback logo on it and all red. Razorbacks was not above the logo its not anywhere on the bag and it do not have the black on the sides. It just a big red bag with a red pig on the front. It sucks. If i wanted something like that then i would have gotten it cheaper at kmart or walmart.
3,A good solid purchase overall,"This product was a good deal overall. The only problem I had with this was a couple of the zippers would stick or the teeth would come apart after zipping, however I use this bag ALOT so this may have something to do with that! I think it is a good purchase and the bag itself has held together nicely."
5,Awesome gym bag,This is a great gym bag. Has extra pockets for your cell phone and wallet and plenty of space inside to keep your change of clothes. Great quality at a great price!!
5,Excellent bag - a great gift,"I bought this sight unseen, save for the picture above, as a father's day present. It shipped very fast, and arrived in new condition. The bag is much bigger than the picture can coney, and it's quality is amazing. Can't recommend this enough for fans of Notre Dame, especially those who need a gym bag!"
1,Cheap bag that won't hold up,"Within 2 months of using this as a gym bag, it tore at the seams in 2 different places, and 2 of the rubber zipper handles broke. Good looking bag, but low quality."
4,Works Great If You Have The Time,"I got this about two weeks ago and use it every day. It takes longer than a hair dryer would, but it makes my hair super straight and my hair stays that way all day long. It takes me about 20-25 minutes for me to dry and straighten my hair with this product. I use it on damp hair and my hair is fine and medium length. I usually go over each hair section twice. First time slowly to dry it and a second time quickly to make sure it's straight. I haven't used it on wet hair so I don't know how long it would take then. This product works great, but it is not a miracle time saver. Your hair won't be done in 5 minutes, but you will be able to do your hair with one styling tool."
1,Waste of money,"First the good: the carpet that the mats are made of are high quality.The bad: despite the images that are currently on Amazon, the floor mats I received did not have the holes for the floorboard retainer hooks that prevent the mats from sliding around. To make matters worse, the bottom of the mats are too slick, allowing the mats to slide around freely. The result was almost dangerous, as the driver side mat would often partially slide over the gas pedal. For me, this was a deal-breaker. I drove with these mats for a month, and ultimately threw them away in favor of a new set of OEM floor mats from the dealership. Very disappointing experience overall.One other minor criticism: the shade of grey that these mats came in did NOT match the OEM shade of grey, and as a result contrasted with the OEM carpet in an unattractive manner."
1,Not what it seems,"The floor mats don't have the holes in them to hook onto - misleading man, misleading... go somewhere else to buy your mats."
5,A book that all adults and children should read.,"This simple little book makes a profound impact on an adult reader. When reading it for the first time, I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. Wise, witty and warm-hearted, it does a great deal to make you appreciate the ones you love and how little the material world means. I can't give this book enough praise."
1,A Nothing Book About Nothing,"I was totally disappointed, when I opened this book. I can't imagine there were so many people who wrote glowing reviews. So many positive reviews convinced me that it must be a winner.Well, I was woefully disappointed, when I opened it. I felt it was absolutely a book about a lot of nothing, and a waste of print and paper........and my money!!!!"
5,"Review of ""The Gift of Nothing""","This book was serendipitous find. My husband and I both love it. ""The Gift of Nothing"" is about appreciating what we have and the people we have to share with. great book, I would highly recommend it for anyone."
3,"I LOVE THE BOOK! No need for the ""Special Edition""","I ordered this as a gift, so I thought the special addition would be nice. It's the same thing as the regular hard cover book but it has ANOTHER cover (shown) that slides over the hardcover book that also has a paper cover. This was a gift to a young child. Anyone with kids would know that this ""special edition"" slide over cover will be in the garbage or hopefully recycling WAY before you are done with the book. I love this book/story. Its very simple, heart warming and great lessons for children! I'd give this as a gift over and over (new books and different people of course) but I would not waist any extra money on this ""special edition""."
5,My all-time favorite children's book!,This is my favorite story to read to my kids. It's understated but smart!
5,"simple, sweet message",Good message about real values in a world of too much stuff. My 4 yr old grandson loves this book.
3,Did not realize it was for a child,"Ok, might be my fault...but I did not realize this was really a child's book. Fortunately the person this was for thought it was cute."
2,Snakes in the Cockpit,"I was somewhat disappointed by the book. Having been around airplanes a good part of my life, I've seen countless photos of crashes and mishaps. Many of the photographs selected were rather mundane and some of the captions questionable. As an example, a B-52 sequence is described as being the aftermath of a ""crash."" A close look at the photo shows ground equipment still hooked up to the ""Buff"" and it parked next to a hanger. Obviously this was some sort of a ground/maintenance mishap. Another shot shows an F4F Wildcat-not F6F Hellcat--against a carrier's island. I can never understand why books are published with detracting errors like this in them.I would have liked more descriptive text attached to the photos. What happened to the crew? What were the circumstances of the crash/mishap? Was the accident due to mechanical failure or human error?"
3,"Good, but buy used.","I need to state up front that I'm an airplane fanatic. If they put a picture of an airplane on rat poison I'd buy it. Ok, so I've thought about buying this book for a while, and have. Here's what I think: the book is solid, good, and well printed. The content, though, is a little ""fluffy."" What the author has done is blown up old grainy pictures, and included brief descriptions of what he supposes happened (which as other reviewers have mentioned is sometimes just DEAD WRONG!). IMHO, Googling airplane military crash would get you about the same results. I'm a little disappointed with the deliberate sepia toning that's been done here too.On the plus side, the book is well bound, printing is crisp (despite lousy image quality in some cases) & the sheer variety of subject matter is mildly impressive.Summing up, this is an odd book, worth a quick look at the library, but not essential to the military aviation buff."
2,..where's the text..?,"landscape format, fascinating if rather dark images but next to no information on what is going on in the pictures...this could have been so much better..the pictures of the Cutless missing the carrier deck and ramming into the ship's beam in a ball of fire with ant-like figures silhouetted against the flames scurrying for some non-existant cover are horribly fascinating...as are the pictures of the Russian Tu -16 Badger that plunged into the sea near a US ship after flying a series of low level passes alongside it...why, where, what and how ..? surely the complier could have attempted more than the rather feeble answers here..."
3,Not enough Snakes!!!,Warning! There are no pictures in this book of snakes on a plane. There are lots of pictures of airplane wrecks that are caused by the snakes... but no pictures of the snakes themselves.
2,slap-dash plot development,"Even an undiscriminating booklover could not forgive the nearly incoherent plot, the sophomoric writing, and the non-existent character development of this book. Even the main characters were downright unlikable. The only reason to read this book through is to discover the laughable plot twist that brings the story to an end. This book is the equivalent of a terminally ill patient, and its time to call Dr. Kevorkian."
1,Possibly the most horrid book I've ever read!,"I can't take it anymore. This book is going in the garbage right now. The reviews from the readers in Michigan and Washington say it all with the exception of ""it stinks"". If you already bought the book, trust me, don't waste your time reading it. If you haven't bought it yet, save your money and consider yourself lucky. If you buy and read it anyway.....I warned you!"
1,I absolutely HAVE to write this.,"I know it's an old book by now, but if I found it, some other poor unsuspecting consumer might stumble onto one and waste her money. Trial By Fire is without doubt the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of purchasing. I got the audio version and from the first sentence I was cringing at the pitiful plot and the psycho characters - no, not the villian, the heroine! Crazy looney-toon, cussing and screaming and yelling and scratching and flying off into tantrums over everything.To top it off, the narrator is also the worst, so the combination was mind numbing. Educated prosecutors and judges, even in Texas, don't say ""fahr"" for fire. And, unfortunately, that was a word often spoken in this miserable excuse for a book. All her character voices were angry and spiteful, even in neutral situations, and it got very, very annoying.Breath-takingly bad book in any format."
1,Total waste of time and trees,"I am an avid reader and rarely start a book without finishing it, but I had to really struggle to finish this one.The author uses stale dialog, old cliche's and obvious plot turns. Her characters are so sterotyped and one-dimensional it's pathetic.On top of that, the supposed crime at the heart of this legal ""thriller"" is ho-hum boring at best with an obvious resolution (after going through the equally obvious twists and turns along the way).Save your money."
1,Trial By Tedium,"The author should retitle this book. I gave it a one-star rating because there is no 0-star rating.The problem? The author can't write.What a sorry state the publishing industry is in when this sophomoric gibberish ends up on the New York Times best-seller list, and when its covers and intro pages are filled with praise by people who should and do know better.Writing a bad book is one thing, and most folks are capable of it.Reviewing a laughably bad book and showering praise on it for whatever reason is another, and to all those who did so in print -- shame on you!"
1,Worse than I expected,"I read one other book by Nancy Taylor Rosenberg several years ago and swore I wouldn't read another. Well, I checked this out (a book on tape..unabridged) from the library and listened to it while driving...that's probably the only reason I finished it.The characters are laughable, the writing is amateurish....I won't make this mistake again."
3,"GOOD, COOL, BUT MUCH HEARD BEFORE","Considering these guys are Teutonic, they pretty much sound like their brethren RUNNING WILD & GRAVE DIGGER - speedy power metal, GERMAN style.Good METAL music, good production and real sweet rendition of SAXON's ""TO HELL AND BACK AGAIN"". If you don't buy these guys, don't worry about it, you are not really missing much but if you don't mind listening to bands who are rehashing it, then enjoy yourself."
1,DON'T BE FOOLED! This is **NOT** an Urban Rebounder!,"This item is listed as a ""Rebounder"" by Urban Trampoline. Note it is *NOT* from Urban Rebounder - the true manufacturer of the fitness club quality exercise tramp."
5,The Redhead and the Rancher,"Just what the rancher needed. Rancher Matthew Clay was as solid as an oak, unmovable as granit. Until temporary housekeeper Jaimie Greene came to the Double C. She was the queen of calanity, riskier than a Wyoming winter. And feisty redhead's tempting innocence and sassy rebukes drove Matthew to distraction. But experience had taught him that a tenderhearted city gal didn't belong on a remote cattle ranch and she woildn't stay. Still he'd never met a woman so determined to prove herself. Or one who loved the land the way he did. Was this confirmed bachlor suddenly ready to face his biggest challenge of his life, love?"
5,Meg's Opinion,This is a Double C Ranch novel. It is a very cute novel and very entertaining. I bought this book as a used book. It was in good condition and arrived is a timely manner.
1,Stonewalled,"Product showed up damaged, but the company was impossible to get a hold of to set up a return. Phone call and email fell on deaf ears."
1,Not worth it,Toys are not attached well at all. They either fell off or the cat pulled them off in a few days. Also was tipped over very easily.
2,That front side bus is too slow for Aero,"None of these has 800MHz. If you check the Vista homepage, you will find that to get the full visual and performance effect of Aero Technology (what Vista is good for) you need a video (graphics) card with at least 128mg discrete memory and a procesor with 800MHz FSB. Toshiba does offer those, just not on any I have read the tech for at Amazon.com"
2,Monitor broke down 1 year after buy,The LCD monitor and the DVD writer broke down just a year after I bought the notebook.Now I have to use it as a desk top ot otherwise throw it away.
1,Customer Support for Classic,"Just to help the poor soul who is looking for contact info...go to www.emiglobal.com. They import the Classic-branded elctronics which are made in China and Hong Kong. I have an older Classic home theater system that stinks as badly as this one. The company that handles their service requests is FDM, Inc. in Livonia, MI. They will replace your broken system for a fee. Both companies have questionable customer service levels and are generally difficult to get in touch with, but with persistance I've found that you can get some resolution to your problems."
3,Interested in getting more details,"Im giving 3 starts cos i do not intend to rate the product here.I like to learn from the buyers of this product how can i contact the manufacture site.I need to download(view) product manual.If anyone knows where i can get detailed information about this product, or manufacturer site greatly appreciated.Should get to know any details please post here.(i do not know anywhere to convey this request)Thanks"
5,Laugh out loud funny!,Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. It was laugh out loud funny. I suggest anyone over the age of 40 read this book and realize that aging is what it is......... a journey that can be full of laughs. I highly recommend it.
3,AMUSING,"Bought this for a short business trip. It is somewhat amusing and I identified with most of it. Especially, the purses and moisturizers. My purse barely passes the security inspection, so that part was very funny to me. Being a professional, I have to carry a laptop with my files and my 'handbag' for an overnight.Most of the book is dedicated to growing older gracefully. Nothing too earthshattering. Just an amusing little book to wile away a flight to Atlanta. I have enjoyed most of her movies which made me smile a little. No little task in my profession of abuse evaluation. Sometimes, you need to focus on the silly things in life to get a balance. This helped to a degree."
5,A wonderful guide to aging with laughter,"I received this book as a gift for my 61st birthday and immediately ordered books for gifts. This is the funniest book I've read in a long time, all the while helping us with aging. I have practiced professional skin care and am a licensed cosmetologist and this book says it all regarding the field of beauty. I thought one really needed to be at least 60 years young to fully enjoy but not so...a friend received this book for her 40th birthday and loved it just as much as me."
3,enjoyable,"I would have preferred a bare it all to the world brutally honest bio... but I doubt if that is going to happen. Ephron's vignettes are charming, entertaining, revealing, and often very funny."
4,hilariously depressing!,"Ah, here is a collection of essays by Ephron that are hilariously depressing. If you want to fear the future of aging and death this is for you!To be fair, ""I Feel Bad About My Neck"" does include essays that are entirely relatable to the younger crowd. Her anecdotes on her burgeoning affinity for cooking, interning in the White House, and falling in love with her first apartment are so riddled with her no B.S. humor that it's quite a feat to tear the book from your hands.Like in her essay entitled ""Rapture"" in which she discusses the magical powers of getting lost in a book, if you're like me, you too can be submerged in the spellbinding anecdotes of Ephron's life."
3,Fun to read,It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. There were cute parts. It is worth reading for a laugh- but not #1 with me.
2,Disappointing,"Save your money and check this one out of the library if you are curious. Unless you are from NYC, you won't get most of the essays - they are shallow and NYC-centric. The best by far is the title essay. I expected a lot more from this author than this book. I immeidately donated it to the local book sale -- look for it soon on the sale table at your bookstore."
2,2 stars for a couple chapters that were amusing,"A few chapters were amusing. It started out promising. But, I would recommend borrowing this from a library. There's only a few funny parts in the book. The rest of it was boring and I didn't identify with her life in NYC/High Maintenance Beauty thing/Gourmet Cooking ramblings. Like others have said, it is a fast read, but not always an interesting one."
1,Comedy book,Not a thing we all don't know as we get older. A little humor but it didn't hold my interest.
1,Title misnomer,"I was ready for some light reading and selected this title because of its allusion to how tiresome it is to put up with the ""one down"" role women carry in society. It turned out to be a self-centered litany of unfunny situations."
3,Just okay,"If you are looking for a book that helps you to laugh in the face of aging, you might like this book. I very much enjoyed the first chapter and found myself laughing out loud several times. Unfortunately, subsequent chapters are not nearly as entertaining. A book that would be better served as a magazine article, for me, ""I Feel Bad About My Neck"" was just okay."
2,"Whine, whine, whine ...","Laugh out loud? Are you kidding me? I had high hopes that this book would give a funny spin to the unfunny prospect of aging. Instead, I find myself disappointed and annoyed by the constant ""Poor me, I'm rich and famous and it takes more time and money to be perfect"" attitude. I don't know about the rest of you, but it's hard for me to identify with someone who leads a life of such privileged consumption. As a real woman who has reached the age of aging, I find it all rather insulting."
2,I feel back about my neck,slow moving with too much emphasis on same topic. needed to keep moving. Realistic and has experiences women can relate to.
5,The Truth,"This book is great. Nora Ephron addresses the REAL issues we women face as we get older. No fluff. She just gets to the point. This book is great for women of all ages, because all women get older! I looked at myself differently, and at life around me differently, after reading this book. Thanks, Nora, for sharing your honest insights!"
2,I Feel Bad Abput My Neck,I didn't care for the attitude of book. It was a quick read and I did laugh at some of Ephron's stories but overall it wasn't I book I liked much.
3,"Out of Touch, but Somewhat Witty","Somewhat witty and insightful on the downside of aging; however, it is hard to connect with someone as privileged as Nora. Plastic surgery, personal ""high maintenance"" (hair, nails, skin) expenditures of time and money, at least two divorces, apartment rent that escalates from $1,500/month to about $10,000, and musing about not being a short-term target for JFK while a White House intern are not experiences that most Americans relate to. ""I Feel Bad About My Neck"" ends on a somber note, mulling over the meaning of life, concluding the aim is to live life to the fullest - perhaps, but growing increasing difficult for the majority of Americans without solid financial and healthcare security."
1,Very Disappointing,"I'm in my 30's and I had hoped to find some insightful advice about aging in this book, but there wasn't any. This book is only a cliche collection of a rich woman's thoughts about things that don't really matter at all (nails, the bottom of your purse, hair color, ""don't buy a couch that isn't beige, "" etc. ); it's not worth the money."
2,I agree with So-So (see 6/12/07),My thoughts exactly 'SO-S0'! To say this book was lightweight is putting it mildly. I expected more from Ms Ephron. I'm glad it was short. I found it boring & kept waiting for something profound.
4,"Humorous essays, leavened by a sense of mortality","Nora Ephron does consistently what Woody Allen does only intermittently: She provides a good laugh about the human condition, tinged by a sense of mortality. Her subjects, like the subjects of many essayists, include life, death, aging, and the passage of time. Yes, on occasion she reflects an elitist Upper East Side (or Upper West Side) perspective, but many of these essays do speak to the universal. This is the kind of book that one can easily read in one sitting, but some of Ephron's thoughts stick with you for a long time."
3,Not what I expected,"I thought it was about women as we age and our issues, but a lot of it was about the authors life, which was fine, just not what I expected. A light read and interesting."
1,Read the book instead,"Oh (pause) My (longer pause) Goodness (sigh). Nora Ephron is a wonderful writer who should never be permitted to read aloud, let alone be recorded doing so. She has horrible reading voice - it's very dull which, I am guessing, is why she chooses to Over Emphasize Every Single Word In The Book as though each word was followed by and exclamation mark! My usual enjoyment of her writing forced me to listen to this through chapter three and then I just found myself teetering between wanting to fall asleep or simply scream at her Exclamation! Point! Style! Of! Reading! That accompanied by her dull, yes Du u uu uu ull!!!! tone made this audio book impossible to finish. Sorry Nora, next time you make an audio book, ask Meg Ryan to record it for you."
4,Women's Glib,This book provides good recreational reading and a hearty chuckle or two for those of us in Ms. Ephron's age group. What it doesn't provide is any insight into Ms. Ephron's thoughts or feelings -- obviously considerable resources that have given her the inner strength to meet the (very public) challenges and embarrassments she has faced. Perhaps this would have made the read less attractive to her supposed market.I also couldn't help wondering if she knows what a terribly privileged life she has led.
3,Geared toward the over 50 crowd...,"Mildly funny - but geared toward the over 50 crowd... as a 40 year old I found it difficult to connect to many of her issues. I think my crows feet are sexy & I feel better than I ever have. I'd recommend the Sweet Potato Queen's books for a lighter take on women & aging, at least they know how to have fun!"
3,funny in parts but borrow from the library - don't buy it,"Ephron's book has age-defining chapters like how you keep a purse, what is up with the whole bad hair day issue, parenting, etc. There were comical parts in this non-fiction read but nothing really spectacular."
1,Whiner,Most people would love to have such trivial issues. She's a great writer but I don't see the point of this book.
2,wow that wasn't funny,"I had never read Nora Ephron or heard of her. She wrote the screenplay for When Harry Met Sally...which I never saw. But I'm pretty sure she was on The Colbert Report when this book came out and somehow the title stuck.Unfortunately, the title is so good the rest of the book falls short in comparison.A collection of humorist essays on being a woman is not new. Nor does Ephron review the subject in new light. Her writing is brief and extremely simple. Each essay begins and ends without substance. I didn't laugh, but I blame Erma Bombeck for this. Some female humorists are just too classic to compete with."
2,I feel bad about the time I wasted reading this book,"OK, sure, here and there a funny line or two. But basically, this is pseudo-intellectual kvetching, just like her movies. Oy! The poor rich Manhattanite who spends too much on face creams and dental care. We should all be so stressed. And she got paid for this, too!"
1,worthless,"This book was a complete disappointment. The author is extremely shallow, even stooping to get a laugh over one of her parent's death. Not once did I even smile."
3,"Cute, simple read","Nora Ephron is an excellent writer and her sense of humor, as conveyed in her film scripts, is well-conveyed in this book as well. She truly has a great sense of humor and a great outlook on her life and life in general. In reading this book, you can't help but feel a camaradarie with her in the aging process and commiserate!I enjoyed reading the book and read it leisurely in a few sittings. I was amused and interested however there was nothing new here. It wasn't as funny as I hoped it would be but it was a nice, cute read."
2,A Review of the Reviews of This Book,"I have this book on hold at the library and it is there for me to pick up. After reading these reviews I will call tomorrow and tell them to put the book back into circulation. I am older than Nora, not as wealthy by far as Nora, do not live in NYC, and do not think that I would find anything funny, uplifting or profound in her book. Glad I read these reviews before running to the library to pick up the book. I think perhaps the funniest thing about this book is the title. I do love that!"
2,Poor Quality Writing,"This was the first thing I'd ever read by Ephron. It will be the last. I am shocked that someone with such a great reputation could produce such mediocrity. It's not clever, it's not intelligent, it's not original. I only read a few essays and couldn't take it anymore. The one positive is that I borrowed it from the library, so it didn't cost me anything."
2,Sold as NEW.,"I ordered this book, advertised as NEW, and, unfortunately, did not open or check it until yesterday. There are two spots on opening pages and in the upper right hand corner is printed, in pencil, Jane J. There is also faint spotting on the last two pages. I need to give this book as a gift tomorrow and I am greatly disturbed at my findings. It was a serendipitous happening that this request for report arrived when it did. Too bad I didn't check the book upon receipt. Now I have to decide whether to give a damaged gift on time, or wait for a replacemment and be late with my gift.I am unhappy about this.Diana Parham"
4,I FEEL BAD ABOUT MY NECK,"MY WIFE WAS THE READER,AND SHE LOVED IT.SHE ALREADY PASSED THE BOOK ON TO A GOOD FRIEND,WHO ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT."
1,What Happened Nora?,I am sorry I wasted my money on this book. I looked forward to reading this book and bought it the first day it was available. I am fifty and thought I could use a light read and a little laughter. What I ended up with were the boring ramblings of Nora's life. I felt like she threw together a few days of journaling and published it. I didn't laugh out loud once. Let's be real we have all heard funny stories about hair in wrong places and mid life short term memory. I kept waiting for something funny and it just went on and on and on.......
1,I Feel Bad about My Neck,"What started out to be a funny, light read turned out to be bitterness about aging. Yes, aging can be hell if you haven't developed your spiritual self and realized that everything material is temporary. I am reminded of the line from the song THE ROSE, ""it's the soul afraid of dying that never learned to live."" I scanned much of this book because I found it pretty shallow. Nora, don't try to apply your thoughts to everyone. I am 71 and I value the wisdom of old age much more than a flawless neck. In spite of your age, you still have a lot to learn. It can be the most fun you've ever had in your 60+ years."
1,Total ripoff,I have never felt compelled to write a review until I finished this book! This book was so random and thoughtless it was irritating! It was an insult to read it!
2,I feel sorry for MY neck,"After seeing Ms. Ephron on the Oprah show, I was led to believe this book would make me laugh and get over my own worry about aging...Instead, it made me sad and I felt melancholy for days after reading it..It was an ok book, about how much money she had and divorce and death, not at all what I thought it was...Definitely not the typical American women that I am familiar with."
2,Not compelled to finish,"I was looking for some light humor to keep me entertained over a rainy weekend. I read the reviews on this book and it sounded like just what I was looking for. As others have said, the first chapter had some laugh out loud lines. After that, I just could not force myself to read much more. Life is too short to waste on boring books."
1,Disappointing,"Let me say first...I love Nora Ephron! However, I was so hopeful that I would greatly enjoy this book and felt so disappointed when I read it. In fact, I didn't finish the book because it did not hold my interest beyond about 35 pages. I kept reading only because I thought it might get better. I wish I would have enjoyed it more."
1,This book was disappointing,"I did not find this book amusing. The title led me to believe that I would relate to this author and what she had to say. Ms. Sphron focuses on being disorganized, which I'm not, so it's just a difference in our ersonalities, I guess, that caused me to be disappointed with this read."
1,BORING,"I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY FUNNY and it was in a very few instances.Overall, I was disappointed and glad it was a short read."
2,Nora should stick to novels and screenplays,"I feel bad about the money I spent on this book. Nora Ephron is a genious when it comes to observing and writing about other people in modern society, but this collection of essays falls completely flat if one is to believe it is about thoughts on being a middle-aged woman. She makes a couple of good observational hits, but the majority of it is too personalized and elitist. How many of her readership can truly understand and relate to living in New York and being a successful journalist, author, and producer? I wanted to read and laugh about the inevitable things that happen to women as we age and be able to relate to my sisterhood around the world and throughout time. Ms. Ephron includes too much fluff from her own unique life circumstances here to accomplish this. This book just demonstrates that even the most talented writers cannot be successful in every genre they attempt."
5,Hilarious and poignant in one book!!!,This is an absolutely wonderful book and a must read for all women from 20 to 80. Nora ephron talks about all the things you think about. What an insightful person. She tackles issues with humour. I was pleasantly surprised that her book dealt with indepth personal issues as well as the superficial ones.Very very entertaining
4,MY REVIEW,I FOUND THIS BOOK ENJOYABLE. THERE WERE SOME VERY FUNY MOMENTS. I DID FIND SOME SPOTS TO BE A BIT BORING. OVERALL I WOULD GIVE A GOOD READ TO THIS BOOK.
4,My New Best Friend,After reading this book I knew I had found a kindred spirit. Great timely observations and good for a LOL experience.
5,Necks And Falling Faces,"Ephron's book reminded me of the Golden Girls, still seen on many late night channels and still funny. When Blanche learned about falling faces when you look down into a mirror, it was a classic moment for many women. Nora's dry humor has almost always been funny, and this short book of essays tickles aging bones. I read it while driving a few hundred miles to New Orleans with 5 women in the car. We were going to a book signing by Rayna Gangi and had Nora Ephron's humor as a sidekick. Between the two of them, I feel much better about who I am, and can look in the mirror and smile."
2,"Could have been great; instead, falls short","Ephron has some good and funny stuff in there, but I felt like I was always waiting for the climax. It's a collection of stories about her life (which are supposed to ultimately show her thoughts on getting older), but there's no cohesion amongst them and I finished most of the stories thinking ""Um, okay, that was random... Why do I care?"" She never seemed to take the stories as far as she should have. They could have been really great, hilarious anecdotes, but because of the way they were told, I was left less than amused."
3,Not her best,"There are definitely some funny bits to this book. But overall, it feels like her publisher was trying too hard to get the page count over 100. Some of the essay's just don't fit."
3,So-So,"I've enjoyed her movies but the book is a bit of a disappointment. The long chapter on the New York apartment building is a bit dull to any but the New Yorker in my opinion and amounts to a big whine because this deservedly talented and wealthy lady couldn't get a steal of a rent on an 8-room apt. in a classy old building. And like every Liberal writer of today, even the humorists, she inserts her Liberal anti-war opinions in here and has a short chapter on her lost love for Bill Clinton (yawn). But some of the stuff more common to the rest of us ... made me laugh out loud a couple of times. So not all was lost."
4,Good but a little disappointing...,"Nora Ephron's books have always been clever, thoughtful and worthwhile. This book is good too, but not great. I was hoping to laugh more and gripe less. At the end of it I felt disappointed. Her last chapter was a downer. I didn't get the impression that she was lovin' life."
4,I feel bad about my neck too.....,This hilarious book really addressed some of the issues we all face in mid life.
3,Nora's a lot of fun,"This is not a book but a collection of thoughts, information about being a woman, a New Yorker, her history, and very down, sad thoughts about death.Nora writes wonderfully except for frequently jarring sentence ending prepositions.I will buy and read other works by this author."
4,Amusing,I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a light and comical viewpoint on aging. There are many books on the market that tell us how wonderful the aging process is but none that give the inevitable downsides that we all must face in such a delightful format. Nora Ephron has a very sardonic sense of humor and knows how to present it. This book was so amusing that I sent it to my four sisters!
3,Book not what I expected,"I thought the book was funny, entertaining and a quick read. She is an excellent writer. That said, I felt the first half was better than the second. The book became too much her self indulgence and not enough an expression of experiences that EVERYWOMAN could identify with. I could not relate to her frustrations about her huge apartment in New York. She spent too much time reminiscing about her personal experiences and not enough time using her wit and wisdom to analyze and comment on more topics specific to women as they age. I would have liked the book to be longer. I was left wanting more at the end."
5,Better than I expected !,"I loved this book! I have never read anything by this author...she seemed a little too New York and maybe ""new age"" for me...whatever. But I read a wonderful review of the book, sent away for it, and now I am ordering extra copies for friends. Yeah, okay, it started out TEN stars and ended up barely five, but it is SO me and what is happening to me and my friends right now...I couldn't believe, and was happy to know, that these things are happening to other people besides me. Hurray! It's a fun, fast read, but take your time and enjoy it, too!"
1,A waste of $8.59,"a very quick read indeed, a couple of chapters at the start are cute but you'll be speed reading and skipping paragraphs as you get into it. NOT worth the price."
2,Not for me,"Let me start off by saying that I mostly read fiction (I read to escape) and even though I've read nonfiction books that I've loved, a lot of nonfiction just doesn't appeal to me. I didn't enjoy this book much at all. I did like the essay about reading called On Rapture, but the rest just fell flat for me. I didn't find her funny at all. I also didn't find her insightful or interesting in the least. I feel like this book's only redeeming quality was that it was short and I was able to read it in just a few hours."
3,Strong beginning - then it lost ground.,I was shocked at the size of the book when I rec'd it. It is really a quick read. The beginning was entertaining and then it went in a totally different direction. It felt like random pages from a journal that did not really tie together at all. Maybe okay for a quick read on a plane trip. Buy it in paperback - hard cover was not worth the money spent.
4,Fun Reading,"This book is a one day read, entertaining and funny, until she brings in the political debate for a bit in one chapter. I feel she could have left that out, it created a bump in the road for me and I didn't want to know her political views. I bought this for my mom to read, she's the same age and has said and done the same things, like pulling her face back and thinking she looks better, etc... We enjoyed it and I recommended it to others too, with the warning about the short digression into the political debate."
4,"Funny ""thoughts on being a woman""","Nora Ephron nails the travails of aging with this humourous, bittersweet collection of essays. The author leads off with I Feel Bad About My Neck, and then follows up with even funnier stories of moving, parenting, food, and trivial everyday things that affect a woman's life. Which brings us to my favorite essay I Hate My Purse. Her description of a purse that contains, ""a morass of loose Tic Tacs, solitary Advils, lipsticks without tops, ChapSticks of unknown vintage ... Kleenexes that either have or have not been used but there's no way to be sure one way or another, scratched eyeglasses, an old tea bag..."" She's obviously been digging around in my own bag. Sure, Nora's New York upper crust life doesn't mirror those of us, the masses, but facial hair, kids, jobs, houses, and aging bodies cross all economic lines. This book is easy to read, entertaining, and provides a feeling of universality that makes one realize, ""I am not alone!"" Read it and laugh."
2,1st time reviewer - Very Dissappointed,"I always hate when I read negative reviews on a book I am planning to buy. However, I feel it is my duty to save you the $$$. When I saw this author on Oprah, I thought she was hysterically funny. I bought not one but two copies of this book. One for me and sent one as a gift. I was so dissappointed. First, if you saw the Oprah episode, don't buy the book, all of the highlights were seen on the show. Other chapters were just ramblings about her life and were not funny. $30 bucks down the drain."
2,i feel bad about my neck,This book started out very funny and then crashed. I finished reading it because it was the selection for my book club.
2,not what expected,Not what I expected after hearing her interview on the tube. Could only relate to a few of her stories and found the others quite shallow.
1,Book,"I can't recommend this book. It just didn't seem to have anything I could benefit from. It may be a best seller, but it's one book I didn't keep."
2,Not so funny,"This book was not nearly as entertaining or funny as I thought it would be. I like most of Nora Ephron's movies, and she was really funny when I saw her on Oprah, but I was disappointed in this book. It's a decent book if your expectations aren't too high."
2,"2 stars, maybe 2 1/2...","I remember when Nora Ephron's ""Heartburn"" came out and loved the book...thought she couldn't go wrong, but maybe it's the nonfiction thing...Just read another review here that stated it most accurately -- ""...just a lot of fluff to fill up the pages...""And I get tired of her cynicism...Life really ain't that bad, and you are as young as you feel, even if you happen to feel bad about your neck."
2,I feel bad about this book,"One of the things that makes Nora Ephron such a talent is her ability to encapsulate the BIG things in life with small telling examples. Alas, this compilation is too much Nora and not enough Everywoman. Her essay about her neck and her ruminations about her handbag have hilarious and insightful moments, offering universal truths we all can identify with. Alas, there are too many specifics about Nora's life that we can't identify with: her endless & dull apartment saga, and those endless & dull cooking references. Plus, her not-so-subtle hints that she's made bales of money get awfully tiring. You obviously want to tell us, just come out with it: How rich are you? Overall, her essays have a sad tone, and many feel like she just banged them out. Her ""Crazy Salad,"" now decades old, showed such crisp wit and compelling promise. This is not a fitting tombstone piece from such a talent."
4,This Will Cheer You Up,"A friend gave it to my wife when she was ill and it was great medicine. I didn't need cheering up but couldn't put it down. It's a fun and fast (2 hours?) read, worth the price and worth passing on."
4,Bad Neck Too,Loved the depiction of her life in NYC. I felt I was there. The book was too short - a delightful surprise. She should write another.
1,I love the Sally Army...,"...because you can pick up a book like this for free and read the whole depressing thing while sitting in someone's old rocker ($15 bucks as is) waiting for your adored partner to scan the back, front and sides of every vintage phonograph album in every box in the store. Damn. To think some people spent twenty dollars for this colossal waste of time. It wasn't funny. It wasn't insightful. It wasn't honest. And it short changed her fans (I know she has fans, how else would something like Sleepless in Seattle get considered a ""classic"" romantic comedy?) something fierce. Next time I find myself rocking away in the used book corner, I'll do myself a favor and read something like the Celestine Prophesy. Could it be worse? I can't see how."
2,disappointed,"Usually I love Nora's books because I think she has a wicked sense of humor and I can relate to what she says, but this book was boring and depressive. I never could finish it"
5,The absolute funniest book ever,"OK, it's not often that I write reviews, like hardly ever, but I feel I must write one for this book. I listened to the book-on-cd narrated by Nora herself. Oh my God, this is the funniest thing I have EVER read or listened to. I was laughing so hard at one point in the car I almost had to pull over. With the exception of one very sad part near the end - during which I cried and I dare to say you will too - I laughed my way thru it. Also, I found it extremely interesting (and funny) about her life in NY. I recommend this book to any woman over, say 50. I am also going to purchase 2 copies for friends for their birthdays. If at all possible, listen to it instead of reading because her voice is priceless - what a wit!!!! You will not be disappointed in this book."
2,I Feel Bad About My Neck,"If this is a review about the object (the book), it arrived in wonderful condition and was everything as advertised. However, if this is a book review, I would not recommend spending the money to read this book. I was very disappointed - it did not live up to the author's reputation. I'd suggest going to the library for this one - it's certainly not a great addition to your own personal library."
2,I Feel Bad About My Neck - Book Review,"Well.... I paid the 9.99 to read I Hate My Neck on my Kindle. This book was our book clubs next read. I've read about 40 pages and so far I haven't gotten into it. I don't feel like it is going to go anywhere. I'm not a person who would ever think about getting cosmetic surgery. I am what God meant for me to be and yes the sags are coming. I am almost 60. My secret is do what I can do (hair, make-up) for going out. After that, don't look in the mirror. LOL"
3,I Feel Bad About My Neck,The book had areas of humor in it but found it very slow to read....mostly an account of her life but no outstanding moments for me really.
3,"A few laughs, but meh...","Ephron writes well, and some of the observations are interesting/funny/wry. She is obviously writing from the perspective of the financially well-off. I just couldn't relate to the obsession with appearance. Pedicures? Facial threading? A face cream that is too expensive to use? Not quite what I was hoping for..."
2,She's a Ramblin Woman,"Nora Ephron should have titled this book, ""Ramblings And Other Thoughts on Being Me."" It feels as though she sat at her computer and wrote this in one sitting, picking whatever topic just popped into her head. Half of it could apply to anyone not just women. The other half is autobiographical - mostly a rehash of what is already known about her.One pro: On page 41, she admits that the recipe for Lima Beans and Pears from her book, ""Heartburn,"" was missing brown sugar."
4,Cried It Was So Funny,"OMG! I was choking with laugher. Can't remember when that happened last. N.E. has a wonderful style,I felt as if she was writing to me. I'm buying copies for my girlfriends!"
3,I feel bad about my neck: and other thoughts on being a woman,Very light weight. Got a couple of laughs but not enough in it to make this book worth recommending.
3,A book with many moods,"This book started out much the way I expected, with two amusing chapters entitled ""I Feel Bad About My Neck"" and ""I Hate My Purse"", both of them full of fun and descriptions I could really relate to. As the book progresses, however, author Ephron jumps from current problems which come as a result of aging, to a look at her past romances, marriages, and mistakes. By the end of this short book, she is declaring her dissatisfaction with growing older, despite having a good marriage, apparent good health and the money to live a comfortable life. The chapter called ""What I Wish I'd Known"" is full of cute and witty short sayings, but the mood changes dramatically in her last chapter, ""Considering the Alternative"". Ephron doesn't discuss life after death and doesn't seem to be looking forward to much in the next few years, which is a sad way to end a book which had been a lot of fun up to then."
3,This book is a real lightweight.,"I love Nora Ephron, and there were times when I laughed out loud at her observations, but for the most part I was disappointed in this facile book. This novel is pretty superficial and reading it felt like eating cotton candy. It made me hungry for a real book."
3,I Feel Bad About My Neck,The book was not as funny as I thought it would be. I saw the author on TV and she was so funny that I could not wait to read the book. I was slightly disappointed.
3,Why feel bad?,I don't understand the hype. Nora is a great screenwriter. I was disappointed. Maybe I was looking for a little more substance.
2,Do you want a little cheese with that whine?,"Nora Ephron is getting older. So are we all. Getting older is generally viewed as better than the alternative. Yet Nora complains that she is just too wonderful to even bother to comb her own hair - but it's just soooo far down the block to her stylist - and what if it rains? Cry WAH-Wah-Wah all the way home.Manhattan matrons with little else to do but Lunch with the Ladies may be amused, but Ephron's purportedly funny stuff is so out-of-touch an affront to the majority of American women of this-certain-age as to be callous and nauseating. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
5,Ms. Ephron knows us all!,Reading this book is like a slumber party with all your best girlfriends. Pass the chocolate chip cookies and enjoy some girl time!
4,"Ahhhh, To Be Young Again.","A funny, quick read. The book will resonate more with the ever-wrinkling Baby Boomers than the Generation X, Y, Z or whatever the heck the younger age groups are being labeled nowadays. I doubt very much if my twenty-year-old self would have found most of Ms. Ephron observations to be amusing or worth my attention. However, speaking as a slowly-decaying, forty-seven-year-old male, the author's book was a wonderfully sarcastic and hilarious reproach about ""the Golden Years."" Well worth reading if you are old enough to remember when gas was 32 cents per gallon."
3,Its ok,"Some very funny moments. Sometimes hard to identify with author although I, too, feel bad about my neck. I guess not the type of book I need to read now."
3,Easy reading,"Looked forward to this book but found it a bit slow , although did have a laugh would recommend this book"
3,Not to Bad!,"This was a funny book about a woman living in NYC. It details her life through various time periods. She talks skin, fashion, delicious food, love, marriage, children, work and self realization. I Feel Bad About My Neck is a good book to read when trying to find out ""who you are"""
2,"Witty writer, not her best","I liked the first chapter and had great expectations, but as the other chapters started to unfold, they became tiresome and no longer interesting. Not enough substance to hold my interest. She has done some wonderful work."
1,Skipped several pages,I am sorry to hear that she died and it makes me feel bad for writing a negative review but i just couldn't get into this book. i didn't get the point of it. i skipped tons of pages just to get through it.
5,Integrity,Fortuna mailed me a check for the 53 cents postage due-- a pleasant surprise! They are a business with integrity.
4,Grow old along with me The worst is yet to be,"Nora Ephron is a sane realist, and provides a witty and occasionally funny reply to the Gail Sheehy 'everything becomes more exciting after the age of seventy school'. She is honest about the difficulties and cost of 'maintenance' in the later years. And in fact she confirms a piece of wisdom once transmitted me to by Rabbi Eliezer( Lou) Jacob who when asked at the age of eighty- eight , how he feels today , said ""Better than I will tomorrow.""At the same time her feisty spirit does give a strong sense that there is no need to raise one's hands in surrender at the passing of sixty. She informs us of how she works hard at keeping body and mind in reasonable shape.This is a small book and often a note of sadness creeps into it, but it can be read, by and large, with pleasure and delight."
5,As funny as all of Nora's other epistles,It brightened an evening after a trying day. Laughed and smiled a lot. Lent the book to a colleague who felt the same. (Our necks have serious problems!)
1,Now I feel bad too.,"I wish I had read some of the reviews before wasting valuable summer reading time and money on this. It seemed like endless pages (amazingly only 139) of complaining about things that are well within someone of her means control. If it is such a burden to keep your hair dyed, stop dying it and learn to love it gray. Hey, you know what, if you're over 60 we all know that its not your real hair color anyway. No one cares if you hate the time it takes to get a manicure, most of us don't care or will never see your manicure, please don't bore us any further with your petty whining. This book depressed me. Thankfully the next book on my reading list was Jen Lancaster-now she was funny, same topics, appartment hunting in the big city, hair dying, but way, way funnier."
2,The title must have made it a Nationwide Best Seller,"As said, it must have been the title, and the first couple of chapters that made it a best seller. I kept having to urge myself on to keep reading, because, somehow, I simply couldn't relate to much of what she wrote. My expectation was that as a woman, I'll relate to anything she said. But this book talks about living in NY experiences (which I appreciate very much as I love NY), but can't relate to it. Also, it's a priveledged life, again, someting I can't relate to. The last few chapters I forced myself to read, the last two I simply skipped as I was too bored.42-year old in MD"
1,Waste of Time,"I really feel cheated out of several hours of time and the cost of the book. Instead of funny and insightful, it was whiny and shallow. I should have read the reviews at Amazon instead of seeing her on Oprah and thinking the bookI Feel Bad About My Neck: And Other Thoughts on Being a Womanwould be worth my time and money."
1,Boring,"This was given to me by a friend who selected it as part of her years's book club basket. What a dissappointment! As I am over 50, I have read it all before, elsewhere. I also read it after Bill Bryson, there is no comparison."
2,She should feel bad,"This book was a reading group choice, and I borrowed it from one of the other members who had purchased it. She delivered it to my door, saying, ""I can't believe I wasted money on this book. It's just a rehash, it stinks and the author should be sued.""Unfortunately, I have to agree with my friend. After giving it a chance, I ended up being bored and sick to death of Nora Ephron's superficiality. She obviously lives in a world of shallow, self-obsessed women and believes that we are all interested in that."
2,Not Nora Ephron's best effort,"I bought this book because I've read some of Nora Ephron's other work, and, you have to agree, the title is great. Parts of it are funny, but its overall tone is pretty cynical, especially if you compare it to, say, ""Sleeping in Seattle."" It lacks balance. Ultimately, it just ends up being a harangue about aging, which does have its drawbacks (I know, I'm 63), but which also brings some great stuff (wisdom, humor, self acceptance, etc.), which is lacking in this book. It's a quick read, but I recommend you borrow it from a friend."
2,A disappointment,"I ran to get a copy of Nora Ephron's newest book, as I always liked her work. I'm glad I didn't spend the money, and instead got it from the library. I expected a very funny book that would be filled with wisdom and wit. Instead I found a slightly funny book that lacked originality and really had nothing to say. It would be too harsh to call it self-indulgent, but in a way it was. So she had a rent-controlled apartment that she loved, so parenting has changed, and so she has to dye her hair (often). Yawn yawn.As someone who is just a few years younger than Nora (ok 10), I am her ""target"" audience and was primed for a good read. Instead, after a few disappointing essays, I leafed through the rest of the book just in case one of the essays was the old Nora. None was."
2,I FEEL BAD ABOUT MY NECK: AND OTHER THOUGHTS ON BEING A WOMAN,"I ASKED FOR & REC'D THIS BOOK FOR CHRISTMAS. THERE WERE A FEW FUNNY THOUGHTS BUT ON THE WHOLE A VERY BORING BOOK. AFTER A WHILE I FELT LIKE ALL SHE WAS DOING WAS COMPLAINING. I DONATED MY COPY TO THE LOCAL LIBRARY, MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WILL ENJOY IT."
1,"I Feel Bad About My Neck, etc.",This was a very light read. I can't imagine why it has been on the best-seller list for weeks. It was a definite disappointment. I thought it was terribly shallow and not worth the short time it took to read it.
1,Lifestyles of the Rich and Vapid,Nora Ephron is rich and tries to hold old age at bay by throwing money at it. It doesn't work.
1,Whiny and a depressing last chapter,"This book was whiny and condescending - I stll don't know if she's still married or not because she only talks about herself and her silly cooking problems (get a life!). She can't blow dry her own hair? How absurd is that? Alright already with New York - we get it - you love it. The last chapter of this book depressed me so much - I just turned 60 and it made me feel like there's no reason to go on. I wonder why the mood of the book changed so much in that last chapter. The book was all fluff and no meaningful in the least. it's hard to feel sorry for someone who can pay $10,000 for an apartment if she wanted to. I felt like she was trying to sound like someone out of the bohemian '60's, naming specialty stores around her and dropping names of people constantly. I wish I could get my money back. I didn't even like her silly movies. And what does ""don't marry anyone you wouldn't want to be divorced from"" mean anyway?"
3,CD on book.,"Not that thrilled with this book. I guess to each his own opinion. If I could really relate to this person's financial situation, then I would have found it funny maybe. However since I don't have a tree out back with money on it, I guess I found it nauseating to hear how she doesn't think twice about money and how she spit it away."
3,Nora Ephron was a Good Writer.,Same as I Remember Nothing. Both books were gifts.I thought it too wordy; my friend said she laughed a couple of times.
3,Nora Ephron never fails to amuse,"I liked the book, but expected more. It's not quite as funny as some of her previous books, and I felt that she possibly has run out of things to say."
3,Should have purchased it for my mom.,"I bought this book based on the title and picture alone. Having said that, it is a very funny book - collection of random thoughts on aging. The only problem is that it was geared more toward my mother than me. So, I passed it along and she enjoyed it."
3,Nora's Neck is Everywoman's,"Knowing Nora Ephron's humor, this book was not far off the mark. There were a few laugh out loud passages. It's a great ""gift book"" for any woman friends 'of a certain age' who have a sense of humor about aging and its travails. The read is easy ... a put down and pick it up at any moment in time. However....which is why it only got three stars .... it is mostly a semi-autobiography of her marriages and life in NYC. Yes, most of us can relate to the generalities that we all face, but if you are a Manhatannite ( which I am not ) then the entire travesty of rent-control and NYC restaurants will certainly bond you to her forever!"
4,I feel bad about my Neck,"The author has captured the feelings of becoming a ""woman of a certain age"" with humor and insight."
5,I Feel Bad About My Neck: and other thoughts on being a woman,"Excellent book! I got the book and the audio. I started to read the book and it seemed a little slow in capturing my interest... but I was going to read it any way. Then I had to travel so I took the audio... And let me tell you... it was wondrful. You just have to hear her talking. You have to hear her as she expresses herself on each of the issues she talks about. These are issues I and perhaps other women have forgotten about in years but today laugh or cry about. This book has a mixture of humor, aging, comedy; women's health blended in a memoir about Nora Ephron. You can read the book but you don't really know where she would place the pitch, pace and power of her words until you can hear her. Its like having her talk to you herself. Both book and audio are great. I recommend it... especially if you were born from 1950 on and if you have had a chance to either live in New York or just visit it from time to time... you will enjoy it!"
3,Articles that women can relate to,I thought some of the articles were fun and interesting. I thought that the book would be more entertaining and funnier than it was. I was disappointed for the most part.
5,Women (and men) Will Love This Book,"I was one of the 5 women in Azzarella's car going to Rayna Gangi's book signing(another great book, by the way) and all of us are at least over 50. Nora, the Golden Girls, even Oprah, will love these stories."
2,I feel bad about my neck; and other thought on being a woman.,Did nopt order but did read it a long time ago and really liked it. Do9 you think I ordered it? Am I paying for it? NOOOOOO
4,Excellent Introduction to Barth,"Karl Barth's Church Dogmatics is one of the most important theological treatises of all-time, which set the agenda for religious thinking in the first half of the 20th Century. However, its sheer size and depth (reminiscent of Aquinas' Summa Theologiae) frequently discourage average readers from delving into its treasury of insights. Professor Gollwitzer's short selection of the Dogmatics provides a useful introduction to Barth's most important themes, especially his understanding of revelation, Christology, and salvation. Great reading for any serious college or seminary student who wants to wrestle with the mind of this great Christian thinker!"
4,"Win some, lose some","The new, 31-volume student edition of the Church Dogmatics has many benefits. The translations are useful, but the editors have retained the original languages in the text. This is a benefit for students who don't have all the languages under their fingers, and for those of us who still have them. Moreover, the way the set is broken down, useful pieces become more accessible rather than being buried in the backs of large volumes.However, and I noticed it especially in III/4, the scanning that they did for this new work has led to a variety of embarrassing typographical errors. ""bis"" for ""his"", ""hun"" for ""him"", punctuation missing or wrong, small things on the grand scale, understandable in a work of this magnitude, but irritating. Mis-training of the OCR, and poor proof-reading for mistakes a spell-checker ought to catch.Still, the benefits do outweigh the small irritation. If only I could assign pieces out of this set ...."
3,Preparing for Marriage: Counselors Pack,"The pack includes a leader's guide and three copies of The Rainey's book Preparing for Marriage. The books themself are chalked full of exercises. There are exercises for the couple, as well as individual projects. I think that the books are a good tool and combined with several other pre-marital material are good for therapy."
2,Not as I expected,"DD received this as a gift a few weeks ago. The product has not really lived up to it's cuteness.PROS:- Very cute/ soft outfit- Cute face- Care Bears Theme- Comes with adorable hard plastice rattle doll- Very soft when filled with water, seems more lifelike than cloth/ plastic dolls- Has not leaked yet ?!?!?!CONS:- VERY hard to fill, the funnel doesn't fit well into the hole- Directions don't gift good suggestion on how to fill with water, other than to ""use"" the funnel to fill.- Doll becomes VERY heavy when filled with water, it's definitely not for younger children- Directions state change water 1 time per week. With as dificult as it was to add it the 1st time, I'm doubting that I will take the time to do this. If the doll starts to smell, it'll be gone.ALL IN ALL I DON'T THINK I'D WASTE THE MONEY ON THIS ONE. THERE ARE BETTER DOLLS OUT THERE THAT DON'T REQUIRE SO MUCH MAINTENANCE (RE-FILLING ONCE PER WEEK) AND ARE LIGHT ENOUGH FOR ALL HANDS TO CARRY."
4,Cute and Cuddley,"All three of my daughters age 8,5, & 2 have one of these babies. My youngest will not go anywhere without hers. I actually think hers is the fullest so it seems to be the heaviest but that doesn't bother her. She drags it around everywhere we go. I have worried about it getting a punture so I considered buying an extra doll just to have on hand because she has become quite attached to this one. I think they are great and would recommend one to anyone. It was kind of tricky to fill the first time but it's not like it took a rocket scientist to figure it out."
2,Sort of weird,This was one of those low budget movies.The interaction of the characters was so the same as you see in other films. No original content.The police detective in the movie was so weird.I could have saved my money and watched a free Amazon Prime movie that would have provided greater movie time.
3,Didn't Contain Significant Market Statistics,"I needed to know the percentage return of the Dow Industrial Index, the S&P 500 index and a few other indices for the last 10 years. Fortunately, I thought, I had just received the Wall Street Journal Almanac for Christmas. Unbelievably, this information is not in the WSJ Almanac! The value of the Dow and other indices are listed, but to get the yearly percentage gains, you have to do the math an figure it out for yourself. And, the information to calculate the effect of reinvested dividends for these indexes is also not given. This was quite a disappointment for me. I can't imagine what the editors had in mind when they chose to omit this commonly used information."
5,every minute useful,"Susan Polgar is a genius of chess. This DVD is nothing but practical, with each chapter giving a powerful tool. The tactics may be well-known, but they are demonstrated and explained in such a way that all but the most experienced should get something out of it to improve their game. One to watch again and again."
2,"Et tu, Mary Ann?","I know I've said that I like the more serious books in the series better than the really lighthearted ones, but this was a bit much.What I always loved about the Tales series was the strong feeling of chosen family among the residents and friends of 28 Barbary Lane. This book betrays that feeling. It was painful to read. Mary Ann was obviously the worst example, but none of the characters seem to quite have their old warmth and interest, with the possible exception of Brian.Very disappointing end to one of my favorite series."
5,Mary Ann Singleton - the heroine who betrayed Barbery Lane,"Mary Ann Singleton first saw San Francisco at 25, everyone fell in love with the midwest transplant, but then when fame and ambition made her betray those closest to her ... she ran to New York and away from it all. It was characteristic of the ultimate lesson of the 80's. While the Tales of the City characters galavanted around in adventure during the 1970's ... the 80's greed and ambition transformed TV star Mary Ann into a cruel yuppie. Ending the saga ... culiminating in the 1989 San Francisco earthquake and Mary Ann abandoning all those who supported her throughout the years. Tales began and ended with Mary Ann ... and it was all just bittersweet."
3,Letdown after the others,"I loved the other ""Tales of City"" books. They are funny, sweet, and addictive. This rating is not meant to discourage any readers who have begun the series, since I know you could not stop even if you wanted to. It is just a warning that there is more heartbreak than laughter ahead. It has to be expected in the transition from the care-free seventies to are more responsible decade."
5,How Dorothy became the wicked witch of the West,"I really hated to read this book because I never expected to hate Mary Ann, I liked her, I identified with her, hoped to go to the big city one day and see all the wonders. After reading this book I read the whole series again , there is no break, it was all possible from the first page, but I never expected this, how could Maupin do this to me. I cried over some books but over this I cried in anger. Only a truly great author can do that to you, but I'm going to kick him for that where it hurts, if I ever meet him."
3,SMALL FOOTBALL,"IT IS A NICE LOOKING AND FEELING FOOTBALL BUT IT SEEMS TO BE SMALLER THAN IT SHOULD BE. OFFICIAL SIZE, I DON'T THINK SO. SPEND A LITTLE MORE FOR A WILSON BALL."
3,Happy endings aren't always necessary.,"I was enchanted with the first half of Scofield's book, and felt privileged to be ""present"" in the life of a Mexican village. The people and settings were vivid and believable. But things began to get trite and smarmy in the last chapters. It seemed as though the author put most of her energies into developing happy (and not too believable) endings for everyone. The last chapters were saccharine and disappointing."
4,Japanese Jazz funkyness!,"Vol. 6 is an unusual entry into the Classic Jazz-Funk Mastercuts series because it strongly features Japanese artists and musicians. The result is a pleasing mix of Jazz cheese and sonic experimentation which will seldom urge you to reach for the skip button.Particular standouts include the opening track, a light and bouncy re-interpretation of the classic 'Friends and Strangers' and the highly sought after club classic 'Trinkets and Things' which, as a 12"" changed hands for a great deal of money.The music is always tightly arranged, melodious and well orchestrated, but those who prefer the more soulful freeforming, or rowdy, shouty Acid Jazz will probably find this album lacking.Vol.6 is not at all what you would call cool, but I absolutely love it!"
4,A gentle story about family,"An elderly couple are excited to make the long trip to visit their grown children in Tokyo; once there, however, they find the children are too busy to spend time with them.This is a lovely and touching movie from the acclaimed director Yasujiro Ozu. His specialty was observing familial relationships and the ordinary day-to-day life of post-war Japan. In ""Tokyo Story,"" we see a couple who love their children and patiently and philosophically forgive them for their rudeness. The circle of life and the real personalities of all the characters make for a poignant story.It moves slowly and may be too long, but the result is an unforgettable glimpse into another time and place. In Japanese with English subtitles. Recommended."
5,What is a masterpiece?,"Yes, Kane has all the bells and whistles, Last Tango is high art, Ben-Hur is the ultimate studio colloboration - none have the simple power of Ozu's finest film. This is the least cinematic of films, the media is truely transparent, Ozu restricts and restricts himself to simple stylistic rules until there is really very little ""film"" and all story. Film has the power to grossly manipulate the emotions - wisely Ozu avoids all these devices. We meditate rather than stare, empathize rather than live vicariously, anti-addiction, anti-trauma, we have real intimacy rather than intensity and release. This is spiritual nourishment, not carnal satisfaction. Frankly, the most mature film from the true master."
1,allen wished to be bergman,"Obviously I am not an Allen fan. His comedies are shallowand boring at best but of course he holds his court and I will notjudge that but this little film which is certainly one attemptto be serious and to look like/feel/sound like a Bergman filmis nothing more that a sad, boring and shallow piece of nothingalthough he had the great Gerry Page in it + Sven Nykvist to photographit.Big ZERO."
5,Stunning,"Not much music in the soundtrack, which contributes to the somber feel of this film. Despite some of the critical rejection of it, and despite the Bergman influence, this is one of his finest. I remember seeing this reviewed by Gene Shalit who was nearly speechless (not much of a change, since he was doing those 30 second reviews for Today back then) and in awe. The performances were natural and believable, and the cast were well chosen. Allen's ""Stardust Memories"" was in part a kiss-off to critics of ""Interiors"". This film may appear derivative, but I found it to be unique, particularly among American films, and couldn't take my eyes off it, despite the deliberate drabness."
5,A serious drama by Woody Allen. Insightful and very well acted.,"Geraldine Page is wonderful in this story of a family facing the crisis of divorce. The emotions of each member; father, daughters, mother, new wife, are laid bare and explored with sensitivity and insight. An unforgettable story."
2,Anachronistic,Did they really have to put modern wind turbines ona product like this? SHAME! I bought this to keepmy wife's collection going... not sure if she will actuallydisplay it.
4,A user friendly source book,good photographs and information for fast identification of the familiar plants we see so often---and others not so familiar. The author includes interesting information about the specimens making it more interesting than the usual botanical guides. Very useful to an out-of-state traveler
5,The best flex 3/8 inch ratchet for the money,"My father purchased one of these ratchets when I was 5. 30+ years later, I found it on amazon. It is the most comfortable ratchet that I have come across. I have Craftsman sockets but their ratchets are horrible. This ratchet is smooth and fluid. With its bent handle and flex head, you'll be able to get into tight places where you never thought possible. It's ratcheting mechanism has many teeth and so you'll find that even in tough to reach areas, you'll be able to use the ratchet. OK, I love this tool so much that I basically have stopped using all my other ratchets--it's that good. Thanks SK for continuing to make this fine ratchet."
4,Great Game!!!,"This is a terriffic game for kids 8-12, but may be a bit too easy for older kids, or kids who mastered tony hawk's pro skater, but everyone should at least rent it. From here, Ill break this up into sections----storyline: preety weird for a x-treme sport game, but still has a point.graphics: not too bad for playstation, tricks are well defined while they are being preformed. (characters later in the game are really cool.)sound: good mix of ""generic punk,"" This is one game that you will just want to listen to the music all the way through. It doesn't match the music from tony hawk, but its still cool.stuff that could be better: well....there could be more regular levels, but the bonus levels kinda make up for that. It would also be a better game if you could upgrade your scooter gear with points or something.All in all...this game gets an 80% Buy this if you're into x-treme sport video games!"
1,more like no star!,"This game stinks, the fact that it was ever created or even thought of bafels, perplexes, and flumixes me beyond all utter belief. I, being a superb master of all that is video games have astronomically, and not to mention cosmically come to the rock solid conclusion that this game bothers me and won't allow me to sleep. You wanna talk content, lets talk about graphics, they stink, there might as well not even be graphics. The music is guterally foul and sickining. I mean come on, who in the world has ever heard of the sloppy meat eaters. Maybe I'm retarted but I sure haven't heard of them. If you've ever considered replacing you roll of toilet paper in the bathroom with something else, Razor Scooter would make a fine replacement. Hey it's as cheap as toilet paper, right? I recommend the VHS edition of RODENTZ over this garbage. You know, that movie about the pack of rats that eats people and somehow manages to throw sexuality into it."
5,The Ultimate Bug Book - With Full-Color Pop-Ups,"This is an incredibly informative book. My 5 year old son loves it so much that we are ordering it again. Our first one is very dog-eared. The illustrations are superb and the pop-ups really bring the world of insects up close and make it easy to understand. We have spent many wonderful hours reading this book together and, as a result, my son now knows a great deal about bugs and their habits. It is a very hands on book and shows children amazing facts. The cricket noise, scratch and sniff stink bug page, and the huge pop-up moth are our favorites. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a child who is interested in learning about bugs. It is sure to bring them many happy memories."
2,Not what I expected,I thought this would have more pictures of the National Parks not just a information and history on them. The information is quite detailed and informative but I would have liked pictures to go along with the information.
5,Definetely a Holiday Hit.,"As far as action games go, Minority Report is unparalleled. It simply is so innovative and neat, and is most definetely worth a purchase. Minority Report follows the movie's plot, but it streches it a little. All the gadgets are successfully transported over, and they are what makes this game shine. There are a handful of jetpack levels, which are very addictive. When you use it jetpack, it actually FEELS like you are getting propelled off the ground. My other favorite additions are the taser and the sick stick, which never gets old. The camera is good for the most part, and so is the difficulty. Overall, Minoity Report is one of the best games available."
1,Fun........for the first 20 minutes,"I bought this game expecting to play a good style of fighting game (the first Die Hard arcade game). But of course, I was completely wrong. The game is pretty fun, but only for the first 20 minutes or 5 missions. After that, it's the most repetitive and boring game I've played. After about 20 missions the only thing that kept me going is the cutscenes in between to see how much is differed from the movie. If you want to waste some time, and money, buy this game, or rent it. But don't expect anything good."
2,Must use a capo,He has an interesting and unique style however everything he plays is capoed... so if you get his video be sure to have a dobro capo so you play along with the songs.
4,The First 10 Years - Live Schooner Fare,"A great summary of the group's terrific stage presence, composed mostly of nautical-themed ballads and some traditional folk songs. These guys are great in concert, and best experienced live. If you want to have a reminder of a great concert experience, or perhaps a preview thereof, this is a good choice."
2,Not What You Think,"As with a previous viewer, this is not the album you may think it is. I bought it to replace my worn out LP and found as the user of the cassette tape, it just ain't all there. Shame."
3,Poor illustration of good material,"This book contains a very good description of the battle, both its cause, and results. It also amply describes the various personalities that participated on both sides. The reason I only give this 3 stars is because of the artwork and maps. Yes the book provides vital maps and some beautiful paintings, but they are printed on 2 page spreads. Given the binding of the book, you can't really see what's in the middle of say Nagashino Castle or the main battlefield without ripping the book in half the process. Beautiful paintings of Samurai in action are marred for the same reason. If the maps had been turned into pull out or fold out pages, it would have made things much clearer and more useful for wargaming etc. A different format would have made this a 4.5 star easily."
1,This is truly black exploitation,"I just wish I could give this...0 stars. As a fan of the 1970s era of filmmaking commonly referred to as Blaxploitation, I am always bothered by the fact that so many misinformed people refer to all of these films as exploitation films... This film is loaded with ridiculous stereotypes and negative images. 3 Strikes is NOT funny, it is buffoonery at its best (or worse, depending on how you see a thing)... 3 Strikes is simply awful!!"
1,3 Strikes = An OUT and OUT BOMB That should never have been made.,"A lame thredbare tired uninspired story of a two time loser picked up from jail by his low life friends. In the car a gentleman shoots at law enforcement officers. Now the two time loser is a wanted man with a third strike looming large in his life when he was a victim of circumstance. YET ANOTHER Insulting racist stupid trite base humorED DVD movie with absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever. If you liked this ghetto comedy flick which I did not you will likely enjoy another DVD of this same ilk called HOW HIGH! another DVD ghetto movie that is just as bad as 3 strikes just the same basic garbage with a different name. Nothing new here.Oh and for those who say I did not see this mess because, I do not detail how horrible it is. I saw 3 Strikes on a satalite TV channel during my vacation. I am just so happy I did not actually rent or buy this ripe stinker 3 Strikes DVD Movie."
1,Worst...Movie...Ever,"I rented this movie almost 10 years ago and have actually taken the time to look it up on Amazon solely so I could slag it for being the worst movie I ever saw. While trying to ride the coattails of ""Friday,"" the producers of this movie have given us a grossly juvenile ""film"" that probably set black film making back 10 years. Some awful stereotypes and much, much more offensively lame, lame, lame, lame humor ensues. This movie was so painfully unfunny that it actually was depressing. Long conversations followed on just how awful it was. Truly, this movie is just too awful to waste more words on, but please distance yourself from this stinker. DO NOT BUY!!!"
2,YOUR AVERAGE GHETTO COMEDY MOVIE,"A CONVICT [BRIAN HOOKS] IS RELEASED FROM PRISON. HOWEVER, HE'S BEEN PLACED UNDER THE THREE STRIKES RULE AND HE'S ALREADY WENT TO JAIL TWICE! WHEN HE'S PICKED UP BY HIS HOMEBOY, HIS HOMEBOY GETS INTO A SHOOTOUT WITH THE COPS AND NOW THE COPS ARE ALSO AFTER HIM AGAIN! UNFORTUNATELY FOR THIS MOVIE, THE FUNNY MOMENTS TEND TO BE SCARCE. BRIAN HOOKS IS OK, BUT THIS MOVIE COULD'VE USED FUNNIER CHARACTERS AS WELL AS A BETTER SCRIPT. LOOK AT ''FRIDAY'' INSTEAD."
1,3 Strikes Indeed!!!,"1 Strike for uneven direction.2 Strikes for stupid acting.3 Strikes for a horrible screenplay.This (VERY UNFUNNY) movie is a complete waste of time, money and energy. Avoid!! Avoid!! Avoid!!0 Star"
1,Tiny messanger bag,"This bag is durable as promised (or at least seems fairly durable), but is only ~9""x12""x3"", and some of the zippers were broken when I received it. Would not recommend."
3,Was hoping for better,"I have owned this cookware for 3 years. I am disappointed as nearly all the pans have warped on the bottom, therefore not having full contact with my glass cooktop. I have to prop something under the handle to raise it enough for proper cooking. I am in search to find the warranty information to see if they can do something about this."
4,Great conductors of heat but handles heat up too,"My take after three years of use:These pots and pans are sturdy and great conductors of heat. However, the handles heat up too. The squared off ends of the handles are also annoying and can dig into your hand when turning a pot or pan sideways. This set is also difficult to clean. I use my non-stick calphalon omelette pan and jumbo fryer pan far more often than the GR pans. The pots are very nice. 3.5 out of 5.0."
3,Where's the suspense ?,I found myself becoming bored and restless as the book progressed because it spent too much time on the love story of the main characters and the hero was a little too perfect. I love Ms. Sala's books but would have liked more suspense.
3,It was okay,"This was a book that was easy to read and I enjoyed reading it, but I had to get by the unbelievable story line.I would only recommend this book to someone who wanted an entertaining read with not much depth."
2,"SLOW, SLOW, SLOW!","I believe that Sharon Sala's novels would appeal more to the romantic reader other than the suspense reader. It is so hard to distinguish if the majority of the novel is going to be suspense or romance, when they say Romantic Suspense. The suspense parts of ""Butterfly"" were very slow. The book was good in the beginning, but then it got worse. Boring! Trust me, save your money on this book!"
3,SPLINTER REVEIW,I'd say it's really a neat toy. But I think the turtle figures are better because they have more action in them.
3,too expensive,"I bought this for my nephew who wanted the entire collection. it cost me 50 and i think its overated, its very small, its only like 4 inches tall."
4,Lawson's work is decent,Lawson's work published by Kregel offers good insight into the biblical book of Proverbs. While from a different era its perspectives will give diverse thought which may be very helpful. Cody Jones has written a terrible book on Proverbs yet seems to be bashing other decent works here utilizing the Amazon reviews as a advertising means. This is despicable. Buy Lawson's work instead.
4,Fonda Rae Touch Me,"Fonda Rae Touch Me is not so easy to find on cd (and on vinyl) so this is your chance to get the 9+ minute version here. I don't play this cd all that much, but I have a vinyl copy or two of Fonda's Touch Me. The CD was compiled by Lindsay Wesker.Hutch, Willie - In and out (Disco Mix) (7.17)O'Jays, The - Put your hands together (Original 12"" Version) (7.01) Aleem - Get loose (Original 12"" Version) (6.58)Royce, Rose - Magic touch (Extenden Version) (5.59)Loose Ends - Gonna make you mine (West Side Mix) (5.43)Fonda Rae - Touch me (Original 12"" Version) (9.32)New Jersey Connection, The - Love don't com easy (Original Version) (6.29)Funk Deluxe - This time (Original Version) (5.12)Booker Newbury III - Love town (Original Version) (5.15)Sims, Joyce - All and all (Take Twelve Version) (6.10)One Way - Mr. Groove (Original 12"" Version) (4.43)Cashflow - Mine all mine (Extended Version) (5.05)jahsonic.com"
3,so-so,"Recently I've gotten into reading Chekhov's short stories. Usually when you do something like this, your enthusiasm is somewhat deflated by finding so many duds among the good ones, but I haven't had this experience with Chekhov. Most of the stories are good and there are only a few duds among them.One thing I did not understand when I started this was that Chekhov wrote volumes and volumes of short stories. It's not like Hemingway, where you could read them all if you somehow got hold of a thick volume. No, the complete stories of Chekhov would span several volumes.So there's nothing sacred about this Signet paperback. Actually, there's no many stories here on account of the last three or four really being novellas. As far as picking out what I would say are the most mind-blowing stories of Chekhov, this book is nothing special. But it is a handsome edition."
3,Hard to use,The clip is very hard to open. I have to use two hands. A child or older person probably couldn't use it.The light isn't strong enough to illuminate a whole page of a book.I found it only useable if I held it. If I clipped it to the book I had to keep swivelling the beam to be able to read the book.I'd suggest holding out for something better.
1,The worst of JSBX,"I'm sorry, but this is horrible. I'm a big JSBX fan, but this CD has bad rhythm and completely unintelligible lyrics. They must have been on... Don't buy it. If you like music that's really weird on purpose, buy Pink Floyd instead of this. You can get all their other CD's, but please not this one! I can't believe other people gave this a 5 star rating. They must see the world a lot different."
2,Did not last long.,"First one lasted two weeks and the second one lasted around 9 months. I just expected to get more time out of my power adapters. I know the price was very low, but other adapters with a low price have lasted longer."
4,Smashing Goodness,"One of the main things about the game's shipping I wish had been done was that it was shipped in the package without a jewel case. However, the game's smashing and crashing robots more than make up for whatever complaints I have against shipping.The voice acting stinks but that's not why I like it; who wouldn't like to be a giant sized robot, destroying a city: among those cities would be Tokyo itself.All in all, this was a good game to play."
4,slow start,"popped in the game, nausiating text at first, but the story progressed and got interesting, which in turn didnt just make this a beat-em-up colossal robot game. you get to run around as one of the 3 main characters you choose and use grenades too. and being careful as you fight huge monsters with your huge robot was a plus too, since the city you fight away the monsters in will grant you money. despite the looong texts, and how each city was a complete ghost town even when the monsters werent present, its a good game. worth playing, you have to get through the slow start, it gets pretty good. id play the sequel."
1,Stunk,"Don't get this game it is so boring I tried it and hated it. The controls are so annyoying, you have to press r2 and L2 just to step and you have to hold R1 to turn and ..., I mean its terrible and another bad thing is the view. If your lookin for a game like robotech or mech warriors this is not for you. I mean who needs a game where if you get to close to the robot it steps on u and if you are too far away you can lose it behind a building and could be going backwards and you don't notice. It is so stupid. Please do yourself a favor, don't ever get this game."
3,Fun with a couple of tweaks,I've always been a huge fan of mecha and giant robot games and movies. This game is just another splash in that big genre. While the gameplay is engaging players will often find themselves mired down by REALLY BAD Anime cutscenes that you cannot skip no matter what. Square Enix has broke through with the amazing scale on which this new game was made. THE ROBOTS ARE literally STORIES tall and your character is often in danger of getting romped by his own machine. The only frustrating thing about the game play is the Character/Robot interaction. The View is centered through the eyes of your little character. This can get really annoying if the building your standing on is knocked down or if the fight falls behind some buildings out of view. Its also impossible to orient your character with his enemy so that he can deliver hits. I advise renting this game and playing it for the vs playing value that it can bring on a friday night.
4,A nice game,"I thought this game was one of the best extreme sports games i've ever played. In this game you have to have skill, and not just press buttons and expect to get a good trick. They have easy to follow instuctions and you can see them again and again to remind you how to do a trick.The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the graphics are good but not the best, and 5 stars means a perfect game, and no game is perfect."
4,Got him reading,"My son loves these books, he wasn't much of a reader till I got him a few of these. Now all he wants is more ;-)"
4,My favorite for baby!,"I have a baby with some reflux issues, so I do a lot of laundry. This does a good job of getting things clean even without pre-treating, more than I can say for most laundry detergents. Occasionally I have a stain that doesn't come out in the first wash so I throw it the in dirty laundry pile again. Even after drying, the stains come out after the second wash. And the clean baby scent lingers even after drying."
4,Nice Scent!,"Has a nice, clean scent. I have been buying this for about 2 years, the price has gone up dramatically, and it seems the last order is not as concentrated and doesn't quite get the clothes as clean as I would like. I won't be ordering again, it's too expensive now."
4,"A Bizarre, But Intriguing Tale","This book, although somewhat disturbing, is a good read for anyone who desires a look at how humans continually put material objects before their own fellow human beings. Layered in ""sick"" comedy, The Visit brings the ultimate desire for retribution to life, as well as depicting how even normal people can become vicious with revenge, even when they are not the victim. Furthermore, this book depicts how one person can change the lives of other's lives drastically, because of power and money. When read in the context of seeking the reality of life, the desire for riches, the greed of the desperate, and the need to be ""someone"" and be defined by worldy possessions, this book truly gives insight, with a bizarre but intriguing tale."
5,An all too realistic look at humanity,"The Visit is a moralistic play with humorous elements. It has an old ""Everyman"" sort of flavor, added to the circumstantial humor of modern day. The play is hard to put down because you find yourself wondering the fate of Ill. The play is a wake up call without the extreme pessimism. It is an easy read that will be very beneficial."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased 4 of these fixtures and had them installed by a licensed electrician in August of 2010. Since it was part of a large project, the work was inspected by our village. Less than 2 years later, 2 of the fixtures are shorting out and no longer light. Trans Globe says the warrany is for one year and I am out of the luck. I am certainly not going to purchase 2 more of these pieces of junk to match the ones that still function, so I guess I'll have to start over and purchase 4 brand new fixtures from another company! Nice customer service, huh? The sad part is that I love the fixtures, but they are no good to me if they don't work. Buyer beware!!!"
5,Spectacular.,"Out of all the albums, this is clearly the most raw, Live Through This should be about a balance between this and Celebrity Skin. Courtney has a great voice, a truly unique voice that not many can copy. This cd is full of rage, really it's a good cd to listen to if you've had not so good of a day. It's also an extremely addictive cd...I don't know how I lived without it. It's too bad Hole usually doesn't get the credit they deserve."
4,This is a Hole cd,"Overall their best cd. More hardcore than Live Through This. The guitars on this cd are just incredible. It's sort of a creepy, gloomy, I can't think of another descriptive word, but its a great cd. Except for ""sassy"" i really didn't like that song at all.Oh well, the rest of it is gold."
4,I know... unradio friendly,"Wether you like this album or not is the way you know hole. If you know them from Celebrity Skin and like those top 40 countdown, you'll hate it. If you know hole from Live Thru this theres a 50/50 chance you'll like it/hate it. I suggest you download their first single and listen to it once a day for a week. I dunno... Garbage man or Teenage Whore. Listen to it again and again. If youre addicted, buy the album. If you hate them, repeat. You have to remember rock is not easy listening, the album is incredibly catchy if you listen to it again and again. One way to start liking the album isby playing it on guitar coz those are fast entertaining songs to play. When i heard it for the first time, i swore i said: ""Im gonna stay away from this cd"". I started listening to Garbage Man, god is it catchy. You'll either love it or hate it. Good Luck."
2,2(3) stars for the two songs that I actually like,"Im with Snakefist2? on the review of this album.... I love Garbadge Man, like Babydoll, and semi like Star Belly?*the one with a clip from Rhiannon thrown in there) I like a few more songs.. But this is a metal album, and Im not a big fan of Metal. The cd is just boring, I didnt expect it to be wonderful, what? after hearing Live through this, that one blew me away. I merely purchased this album to round out my collection of Hole albums.Garbadge Man, is a great song though."
2,I can't believe it's gotten so high a rating,"This is just complete garbage for the most part, clearly representative of the early stages of a band that would go on to much better things. Take it for what it is, an early, very raw release. It's not that good, and frankly, some of the songs are just garbage, particularly Sassy, which is basically just Courtney screaming lyrics in front of really distorted guitars that just strains the ears to listen to all the way through. This has got to be my least favorite phase of rock music, when musicians felt they had to scream into the microphone in order to be original. Unfortunately, with probably 50 percent of the bands doing it at the time, it's neither original nor endearing; it's just noise, plain and simple. For a period piece in a band's history, it's a gem, but for listening to music for enjoyment, it's hard to do."
2,Pretty disappointing,"""Pretty On The Inside"" was Hole's debut album released in 1991. They later went on to release two of the best female fronted albums of all time (Live Through This & Celebrity Skin). Unfortunately, this album isn't nearly as good as the other two, and is a real let down.The songs are either too short or too long and in general are pretty tuneless. A lot of people have posted messages saying it sounds really heavy, but it's more dull than loud. Despite the songs sounding rather bad, the lyrical content is as good as ever. The lyrics cannot be faulted and neither can the vocals. If there's anything that stands out in this album, it's the amazing growls provided by Courtney.The only songs which stand out slightly to me are ""Teenage Whore"" and ""Good Sister/Bad Sister"", but even these are quite poor. I recommend you buy Hole's other albums and stay away from ""Pretty On The Inside"" unless you're a devoted fan."
2,Re-produce please!,"Don't get me wrong...I love Hole. But the song-writing is primitive, and I've heard demos with a better production! A good record to have, but merely to measure the lenghths this band has come since '91. Overall sound, in a word...Wleht!"
2,By far the worst Hole CD I've heard,"the other hole cd's are a lot better than this-to me, the music sounds ugly, and the lyrics arent written well. i really cant see how peole think this is such a breakthrough-that title belongs to Live Through This and Celebrity Skin"
3,Pure Courtney...,"Oh boy! This is really strange. Not that bad at all really, but strange. I can say this: It's a far cry from 'Celebrity Skin'! Mmmm-hmmmm!"
5,Hole's Rawest Moments,"This was the first Hole album that I ever listened to. After hearing the opening track ""Teenage Whore,"" I knew that I was in for an interesting experience. The guitars are distorted, the lyrics are honest and even scary at times. I'd like to say that this is an album that may take some getting used to. Especially tracks like ""Teenage Whore,"" ""Mrs. Jones,"" and ""Berry"" - All of those might be too rough for the average listener...I say give it a chance! If you don't like it, listen to it again. Try to appreciate the honesty and rawness of Hole's first album.Highlights: Garbage Man, Babydoll, Teenage Whore, The title track, and Good Sister/Bad Sister."
4,"Yes, You Are Pretty, Love","The raw grind and power of late 80's music is here, and here alone. Not glossy pop and pretty. Not Pantera screaming. Right in between with the perfect lyrics and rage to carry these songs along.Produced by Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon, this is a wonderful hard rock album. Much different in respects to the later attempts by this same band. No pop, just pure punk. With lyrics of poision laced with girls, fairies, clouds, glitter, rot, wings, and other things that you'd never expect to hear on an album so hard.If you were to review these lyrics, you would see how her own husband used some of her early work for insperation on his later, post-Nevermind, effort ""In Utero.""A great album for anybody who loves rock music"
4,Hole's first album.....,You can definitely hear the difference between this album and Hole's other albums. It's not as good as Live Through This but I think it's better than Celebrity Skin. Courtney does alot more yelling and screaming on Pretty on the Inside than she does on the other albums. I think she sounds better doing than that than when she actually tries to sing (like she did on her solo).
4,Pretty on the Inside,"Pretty on the Inside being Hole's 1991 release and their debute album is an album that is seething with rage. Courtney Love sings with so much anger that you can verily feel that rage that was in her at the time. Songs that standout on this debute album are ""Teenage Whore"" and ""Garbage man"". The booklet is a strange on with lyrics that one can not read and a bunch of random pictures. 4/5."
4,Hole is pretty on the inside,"Loves lyrical talents carry this alubm as Holes mucial talents leave a little to be desired at this point, especially compared to their later album LIve Through This. FOr an early effort this is a very good album none the less and worth the $20 bucks."
3,so mad,"more underground, cd is heavy in a way. filled to the top with rage and pure hate. its cool because she will say Anything"
5,hole's best album,This album is probably hole's best album yet because it's so raw and unrefined compared to 'live through this' and 'celebrity skin'. All the songs on this album are great but my favourite ones are probably 'teenage whore' and 'garbage man' because they are so full of emotion. If you are a true hole fan you should definitely have this album
5,An ambient classic,"The Orb's Aubrey Mixes - Ultraworld Excursions are (in my opinion) the best they have produced, and is better than the original TOABTU that they come from. It does need some listening to."
5,A true mythic masterpiece,"The master of Comparative Mythology delves into the themes, that underlie the art, beliefs and literature of the Western Soul. The third volume explains why the Western culture is so much different from the Eastern Way.It enables the reader to step back and review his/her own culture from a more objective point of view. In the West, it is about the monotheistic belief, about God and Man as a seperate being. Therefore occidental myths establishes a means of relationship between God to Man and vice versa. He also shows up, why Christianism, Judaism and Islam are so similar and the fight over the ""true God"" is so ridiculous.If you haven't read the first two volumes ""Primitive Mythology"" and ""Oriental Mythology"", go for them first!"
5,ancient and universal,"Primitive Mythology is the first book in Campbell's great and sweeping study of myth in the world, starting from his neo-romantic viewpoint of myth as a necessary (and currently missing) factor in life. He embarks on a globally comparative and ultimately reconciliatory survey of kinds of myth and their relative societal roles. Please note that there is a fair amount of debate as to both the accuracy and ethics of trying to mine the universal from global myth in this fashion, but however you come down in that particular debate, The Masks of God is, on its own terms, a monumental achievement."
5,Worthwhile reading,"I found this book very enjoyable. It was a good combination of history, intrigue and romance. I recommend it to all my friends."
2,Tedious,"I purchased this book for a class and was disappointed by how tedious it was to read. I didn't feel like the author gave any real insight, but rather explained minor details and never really helped me understand what I was reading better. This book contains mostly word by word or phrase by phrase explanations of the passages. There is hardly a sentence that is not interrupted by a reference to a passage that you need to look up in order to understand the sentence.I wont say that I didn't get anything out of it, but it's not one that I would recommend."
4,The Art of Christian Listening,This book is a helpful outline of steps to take in being a spiritual companion.
5,Sweet without smelling too powdery or too flowery,"You are never fully dressed until you have on some perfume. Indeed, even when wearing nothing at all (or perhaps, especially when you are wearing nothing at all) you need some perfume - sweet, alluring and sexy. For me, my most favorite scent of all is Elizabeth Taylor's White Diamonds. White Diamonds is sweet without smelling too powdery or too flowery. It has an excellent scent that lasts on my skin and smells excellent.For me and the man of my life, it's got to be White Diamonds. We highly recommend this wonderful perfume to you, or perhaps for that special lady in you life!(Review of WHITE DIAMONDS Perfume for Women by Elizabeth Taylor - EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY 0.5 oz)"
4,Fun for Game Night,"This is a fun little game to start out an adult gathering. The content is sexual, but not inappropriate- we played it at a family gathering, with 3 generations present and it was only a tiny bit uncomfortable for a couple of the middle-aged sons listening to their parents' answers- which made it more fun for everyone else of course! It is actually meant to be played by a couple- most likely alone. But it turned out to be a fun group game too"
2,Crap with some bright spots,"There are really only 4 reasons to watch this film.1. The scenes of Richard Hell & the Voidoids performing at CBGB.2. The beautiful cinematography capturing the Lower East Side of New York in the wintertime in 1978.3. Elliot Goldenthal's wonderfully atmospheric soundtrack.4. Hell's bluntly honest interview about the film.Otherwise it's pretty dire - badly acted (as Hell admits), directionless, nonsensical. Ulli Lommel (who would go on to a thriving career in straight-to-video horror flicks) clearly had no idea where he was going with this movie or even what ""blank generation"" meant. Worth your time only for any combination of the bullet points above."
3,see it just to see,"blank generation is a little quirky but quite good. There are a resonable amount of performance scenes which makes the film worthwhile. If you like punk music you should see this movie. There's some great footage and great sound quality. Andy Warhol's brief apperance is interesting and its just a good movie to see. Not outstanding, but good enough."
3,Richard Hell and The Voidoids.,"Great scenes from Richard Hell and The Voidoids Live at CBGB's in the late 70's, the movie is not that good, but having the chance of watching one of the greatest american punk bands of all times is worth the time."
2,"Voidoids footage ok, movie sucks","It's nice to see some authentic, good quality footage from CBGBs, but the movie itself really sucks. And the Warhol appereance only lasts for a couple of minutes.Five stars for the music, one star for the movie."
2,Boring stuff,Now this is really a bad movie. Ok I Like Richard Hell...and he does appear in this movie...Carole Bouquet is beautiful but this is one unnecessary pretentious movie. It is worth it for the live segments but otherwise...
1,"This One's For Crow, Tom Servo & Joel","When Carole Bouquet was an aspiring young French actress she accepted the starring role in this film about an egotistical, abusive rock star creep (played by Richard Hell, who previously played an egotistical, abusive rock star creep in ""Smithereens"").The only way this film should be viewed is with the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 gang seated front row center. I'm sure Crow, Tom Servo, Joel and Gypsy would have some prime zingers to shoot at this depressing, pretentious piece of New York trash."
3,mildly interesting,"I basically bought/watched this video for 2 main reasons.1) the cameo of Andy Warhol2) I am a guitar playerMy reaction was ""eeh""---the movie is so-so. I'm not a huge fan of Punk Rock anyway...interesting to see a group where the Bass player is out front as lead singer. I guess I was expecting something with a little more edge...I didn't dislike the movie,but it never really ""grabbed me"" either. Warhol got his own proverbial 15 minutes (ironic!) and that was that. The NY Jewish chick/filmmaker was cute--when she dropped the silly wig.The French girlfriend, ah well...she was just as indecisive as the lead character. Like the other reviewer here, I would have liked to have seen more footage of the band and more music."
2,good writing unfortunately plagued with misogyny,"As someone who generally appreciates good writing, I looked forward to reading this collection. It only left me infuriated. Updike is an amazing writer. He truly knows the art and beauty of the craft. But all of his stories belie his misogyny. Men resent their wives, women are portrayed in one or two negative ways--it ruined the whole book for me. So I switched to Flannery O'Connor instead. Good writing, no misogyny."
4,Another fine Updike collection,"""Baby's First Step"", ""The Man Who Became A Soprano"", and the title story all deserve five stars. The others, almost as good, lower the average just a bit. For me, these and most of the stories in his other collections are a pleasure to read. The writing, faceted, gem-like, unlike anyone else's, is at the heart of the enjoyment."
3,I wanted to like John Updike...,"I know that John Updike is one of the more outstanding writers of the 20th century, but I just can't get into his style of writing. What I enjoyed most about the short stories in The Afterlife were the conversations between characters. The conversations Updike weaves creates his characters and the plot, in my opinion. I'm not against rambling thoughts and scenery descriptions, but I'll tell you, there were times when I was reading, and I had to go back and re-read sections because I just began to think of other things.I did like the progression of the story plots. It seems to go from early marriages to older marriages with a mix of divorces and cheating. Family structure and dynamics are the theme in The Afterlife, so if you find that a bit mundane, I would stay away from this book."
4,No Title,"Slanted & Enchanted is essential to Pavement fans. Even if you love the later stuff, you must own this. To address the opinion of the CD being ""unlistenable"", i say some parts are annoying, but not unlistenable. In Slow Century, Thurston Moore says someone telling him S&E; was ""unlistenable"" was what initially piqued his interest in the band.S&E; is just not a great ALBUM. It's a great collection of songs with little cohesion.I will say this: there are some bands we love that will only release their best stuff and sit on the rest of their songs like bastard runts. Pavement seemed to just throw all they had on to CDs with little regard to structure (example: this and especially Westing). Makes you wonder why they even named anything (or remembered what they were called)."
5,S&E is Pavement at their best!!,"For those of you who have just gotten into them or anyone looking to get into them, S&E is the album. Unbelievable writing, drumming, singing; you name it!! One of the best albums of the 80s/90s and the ONE record I come back to again and again."
5,Essential must have!,"Slanted & Enchanted is a beautiful album for a person curious in purchasing a Pavement album. This album is the epitome of koool! I strongly suggest it! My favorite songs on the album are Trigger cut, In the mouth a desert, and Two states! The lyrics are witty and humorous. Stephan Malkmus is an indie GOD! If you love Sonic Youth, you'll fall in love with Pavement! This pavement album is a gem. Trust me, you will not be disappointed."
3,Forming formula,"Highly overpraised debut, still in the process of refining a scuzzy seduction, captures all the lo-fi-lazy energy but is still missing much of Malkmus's melodic math which would infuse future output with a far more informed grace- then only disguised as slacker muck."
5,"there's no culture, there's no spies [apparently]","""most important album of the 90s"" is thrown around a lot for this, which is maybe why I didn't end up getting it until early this year. I had heard a live version of Zurich Is Stained on the internet & loved it, all yelled out & distrorted & then I hear the lp version & it's sort of country-ish, laidback & I was a little bit disappointed. But there's certainly enough screaming & feedback throughout the album, 1 of the tracks Chesley's Little Wrists appears to be just that & probably if it was a single would not be considered too influential or whatever. I'd heard Brighten & Crooked Rain before this. After a few listens I could see why people liked it so much. It's not as lo-fi as people would have you believe, I know what lo-fi stuff sounds like & this isn't really it, [+ CR,CR is nowhere near it]. I like 2 States, In The Mouth a desert, ZIS, Trigger Cut, Our Singer, Fame Throwa & probably a few others the best. I love the sound."
3,"Don't like it, don't know why.","I scoured these reviews for what people chose as the best songs on this album, and then I listened to those songs. I didn't like them, and I can't pinpoint the reason why. The instruments were a bit out of tune and not played especially well, but I never complain about that when I listen to the Ramones or the Clash. I couldn't comprehend half the lyrics, but that's true of most bands. The singer's voice annoyed me, but so does Billy Corgan's and Thom Yorke's and I love both Smashing Pumpkins and Radiohead.So, even though I can't fully explain why, I won't be listening to any of these songs again if I can help it. I gave them 3 stars for being original, but that's about it."
1,c-r-a-p,"that's all i can say about this cd. what the heck is this, do people somewhere in the world actually listen to this rubbish. well anyway if you are looking for MUSIC you have obviously ventured down the wrong path. i suggest turning around before it is too late, this is horrible.the whole cd sounds like it was recorded in a five gallon bucket right after the lead singer and everyone else in the band (and apparently the producer for that matter) just got done downing a bottle of Jim Bean. furthermore, does the guitarist know of any other effect than fuzz. fuzz can be cool but it is really overdone here. well there are my complaints as they stand right now. hopefully I've saved some poor soul from this hippy emo wanna-be junk."
5,Stephen Malkmus is a genius! A rare perfect album!,"Pavement has been one of my favorite bands for a long time now and ""Slanted and Enchanted"" is easily their very best. It is a collection of pop ditties surronded in banging drums, pure guitar madness and cotton candy-like vocals. Every song is bracing songs like ""Summer Babe (Winter Version)"", ""Trigger Cut"" and ""No Life Has Singed Her"" are modern classics. If you like this also try ""Brighten The Corners"" and ""Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain"" and albums by Phish, Guided By Voices, The Sea and Cake, Elliot Smith, Tortoise, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion (kinda harder rock) and Sleater-Kinney. Pavement is a true rock band, of which their are very few left."
5,Slanted owns,"If you actually think this album is less than brilliant....please go live in a corner and listen to nirvana. besides, what did nirvana ever do?! they made punk...that was popular.....and stupid. pavement had all the brilliance of a great band, good hooks, witty lyrics that would make your english teacher proud and a fu*k you attitude to match. they clearly have some brillaint songs here. perhaps summer babe was the greatest non-pop song ever, well that and cut your hair. any idiot who doesnt get this album is really too busy listening to stinkin park to know true music. im sorry this is not full of discernable riffs all the time....thats not what its about anyway....but go on liking that force fed garbage, your life will mean nothing after you hear it..."
2,Sorely Overrated,"Hailed by many as the album of the 90s, S&E is really just a dissonant hodgepodge of subpar musicianship and angsty, overrraught lyrics. It's easy to crown an album and ride a bandwagon, but as the domino effect of fans undulate into a bedlam of uninformed fans, the musical merit is obtusely recognized, and for the most part, unjustified. Regarded as a paternal album in the indie world, S&E is merely a slanted effort at a disenchanted work, rendering a beloved album that garnered immense praise for nothing. Steve Malkmus' drawling lyrics are the first exhumation of Lou Reed's lyrically potent delivery in the 90s. But Lou Reed invented his own style, and his sui generis recordings are still readily available. Try The Velvet Underground or The Pixies for real musical forerunners."
2,Excellent Bielagus,"I bought this album for ""Chesley's Little Wrists"" but then was sorely disappointed. My butt hurts, I blame it on Bielagus. COMMA SPLICE! I also recommend Blues Traveler and Coltrane's experimental period, exemplified in ""Blue Train."" Also, Dave Brubeck. Word is bond, know what I'm sayin'?"
2,Wow!,"Usually the essential recordings are exactly that, but this album just sucks. Forget about clever lyrics and sonic guitar sounds, this is simply hard to listen to. Buy it if you're curious about how bad it is. I give this album 2 stars only because they managed to get signed. I'll be fair though, this is the first album I've heard from them. Maybe the others aren't so bad, but this one really sucks."
2,Overrated for the sake of being an american band,"Don't take me wrong. Pavement is such a good band. They've got plenty of good stuff but most of it happens not to be in this album. Except for a couple of songs (Here, Zurich is Stained) S&E; is mediocre and misguided.Now, I imagine that some critics of some very well-known american magazines needed a band from their own country to hail as an all-time-best, so they could feel better when confronted to the fact that, during most of the 90s and early 00s, american music scene has been way poorer than the vibrant music scene in Europe, particularly in the UK.So these few critics blinded themselves of any real criteria when reviewing Pavement music and, carried away by the ideal of The American Band Of Their Youth that proved they were part of something important, ramdomly chose the band's first and worst album as their holy grial of american indie music. As so many times before, good band, lame critics."
2,"Slanted, Yes, Enchanted, NO","The critics love this band, I can't say why. Perhaps they were the godfathers of the Indie movement, but is that a good thing? They are nothing if not difficult to listen to. Maybe that's what makes them `cool'."
2,"Bad for diapering, good for burp cloths","This diaper becomes fully saturated very quickly. I bought one pack of them and a couple dozen of the more expensive chinese prefold diapers. I used them with the Bummis Super Whisper Wrap cover, which are great. These diapers were retired after my daughter fully saturated the diaper during a nap when she was one month old. I have never had that problem with the chinese prefold diaper and think they are absolutely worth the extra money. The gerber diapers are only good for burp cloths."
1,Not worth your money,"These diapers are terrible! Most of my cloth diapers were hand me downs- they are thick and soft. These Gerber ones are NOT! I bought these at Wal-Mart and when my 9 month old wears them, he has to be changed every 30 minutes. If I don't change him quickly, the diaper can become so soggy that it will literally drip. It's not worth it. Spend your money on thicker diapers."
1,Misinformation on page 13,"On page 13 of this book, the author states that sperm whales are beleen whales. This is not true. Sperm whales are in fact the largest toothed whales. Species-genus: Physeter macrocephalus. Their lower teeth fit into sockets in the upper jaw."
2,Factually incorrect,"My whale-loving 7 year old daughter pointed out serious factual errors in this book. If anything, it's a terrific resource to show kids that just because something is in a book written by a PhD, it's not necessarily true. The book is well put together and has terrific resources in the back for further study. If not for the glaring errors of fact, I'd have given it more than two stars."
5,the best hair styler ever!!,i'm ordering two this time so i never have to be without it... and my girls (18 and 24) love it too. I always use it with the brush on and a round curling brush in my other hand.
5,NEED THE PARTS,I HAVE HAD THIS PRODUCT FOR 3 YEARS AND LOVE IT. BUT THEY DON'T PUT THE REPLACEMENT PARTS IN THE STORES. I CAN'T USE IT UNTIL I FIND A COMB.
2,Styler Dryer comb cuts scalp,"Dryer arrived on time, in good condition at about the right price. I only use the comb attachment. I used this product as I always do and the comb punctured my scalp and my head bled profusely. I must use this product cautiously as I have punctured my scalp whenever I seem to get in a hurry. I contacted the manufacturer and was my complaint was the only complaint they had received. They did not offer to replace the comb, the unit, or even act as if they cared. I threw the item away and bought a different brand."
4,The Conair dryer is fast,"I was attracted to this dryer because of the attached brush. It's so easy to dry my long hair smoothly without having to try to hold a brush in my other hand. It turns out that I really like the comb attachment better. The best part is that the dryer is really fast, mainly because you can direct the air to the wet parts of your hair and not just keep blowing air all around your head like standard dryers. My only complaint is that the unit is very large. A petite person might have a problem handling it. I still think it's a wonderful product."
5,teacher's response,"I have used this at the high school level for students who have low reading levels. I also have used this in connection with explaining the story line. I have also used it at the elementary level where the younger students become fascinated by the story so that when it is introduced in high school, they already feel connected to the story and are not as intimidated by the language. I have used all of her books in these same ways."
3,"Good Leash, Hurt Hand","This leash is good to stay high on the neck (as recommended by Cesar Milan, Dog Whisperer), but it did hurt my hand when my dog pulled."
5,it lives!!!,"my ipod nano was ran over by a car after i fell off my skate board ""hard"" it was unscrached!! isent that unbelievable? this is a must buy for any ipod nano owner,the only thing i dont like is there is no way to charge or download songs without taking it out of the case."
5,Impressive,"I bought it for my new ipod and its esencial for it. It has protection for screen and as many reviewers said, the only bad thing about it is that you have to take out your ipod to charge it."
2,Redundant and Whiny,"This is the second book I didn't like written by the GW, the first being Melody (which got better the second time I read it.) This one didn't. Unfortunately I think that the GW ran out of ideas and decided that he had to crush poor Rain. I mean come on. SPOILERS!! First he kills off her brother and then there is her accident. Then all that stuff that Victoria put her through? It was redundant for one thing. He kept going over what Victoria was doing to her even though he had just said it a few pages before! This was definitely a poor one on Neiderman's side. But oh well, my VCA site can't have all good reveiws lol. If you have to read it, I recomment waiting for it to be at the library or the used bookstore."
4,GREAT BOOK!,"This was such a good book! First off, I think the writer from ""KNOXVILLE"" (see down below-Dec 21st) needs to keep her opinions to herself if she's going to give away the whole story! Yes, dear, you DID spoil it for many people who haven't read it yet. I was included in this as well. I first read the customer reviews before buying the book and ""knoxville's"" comments really did ruin it for me! Anyhow, even though I knew what was going to happen ahead of time, I still think this was a great book. No, it's not one of the ""best,"" but I don't think it's as bad as others think."
3,Not as good as her past books,"I didn't find the Rain Seriers as good as some of her others. But it was not as bad as some like to say it was. There were not as many twist, turns and suprises as in other books. I also don't like the way they kill some many people off. Yes, family members die, but not that many in so short of a time. For once, I would like to see someone actually follow thier dream and see it not end of tragically for them. I do agree with some of the others, they are really getting to predicatable and repatative. I only hope that they get better!"
5,A Good Read,The third novel in this series takes you on journey on how life sometimes gives exactly what we need when we need it. Can't wait for the next one.
2,Not Too Great,"Yes, the book was the best in the series. But that isn't saying much. The plot was somewhat entertaining, but it had nothing to do with the first books in the series. The second book should have been left out entirely because it added nothing to the plot and, if her name was changed, could have been part of a seperate series. This whole series was just a copy of other series, nothing new. Once again the ghostwriter's plot is the same, poor girl loses a parent and goes to live with rich relatives and falls in love. Yawn! I'm not saying that all V.C. Andrews books are bad, that isn't true. She is my favorite writer and I'm sorry to see the ghostwriter print trash like this.The best books r the Flowers in the Attic books. The first books in the Logan series are very good, but in the last couple of books they go back to the same poor girl to rich girl plot. V.C. Andrews has written many good books, this just isn't one of them."
3,just another storm,"although this book was better than the first two book in the hudson series, it still wasn't great. when grandmother hudson dies, rain is to inherit millions. aunt victoria, on the other hand, has other plans for rain. rain thought her aunt was crazy before, but she never realized just how crazy she was until rain is forced to live her after a devastating accident. rain is just about to give up on life, until she meets austin clarke, a physical therapist. it was love at first site. aunt vicortia doens't like rain hanging out with austin, and she takes drastic measures to keep them apart. just when rain thinks that her life couldn't get any worse, rain finds herself in a situation where she has to fight for her own life."
3,Same Ole Same Ole,"Some may say that Rain was better than most of the gostwriter series, but seriously ...The only good series the gostwriter ever wrote were the Logan, Cutler, and Orphans.The rest ... well lets just say thats a waste of eight bucks ... if you want a book to compare to the sensational My Sweet Audrina, or Heaven go out and buy Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden or Rebecca by Daphne Dumaurier."
1,Very Loud,"This is by far the loudest aquarium air pump I have ever owned. It has a lot of vibration and transmits the pump sound through the air tube into the tank, where it is magnified. I would not recommend this pump to anyone, and would suggest a Rena or PenPlax instead, in that order."
4,Good product,"Been a week since I got a set of 8. So far it looks good. Solid sturdy build, installs easily and looks great.Only con is that you have to very careful during installation because the inner glass bulb that covers the real bulb breaks easily."
4,"Good theme, but All in Black & White","I bought both C. Zinn's books ""Javelin Photo Archive..."" and ""AMX Photo Archive..."", as well as Patrick Fosters's ""AMC Performance Cars..Photo Archive"". Although it's good to see more books on AMC cars, I was dissapointed, and not expecting these books to all be in Black & White only. Not a trace of color! Although I do feal that the two books by C. Zinn, have more of a purpose in the ""concept to Reality"" theme, rather than just being picture books. Given the price of these paperback books, and because it was not obvious from the Amazon description, I thought it was a good idea to at least let others know of this fact. If you like color, this book is not gong to have any. Try Larry Mitchell's ""AMC Muscle Cars"", or, ""AMX &Javelin; Gold Portfolio"".Bottom line: Appreciate the effort put in the concept to reality theme, but a little disappointing for me. It would have been a great book if it was in color for a little more money."
4,"""Ostrouski"" misspelling of Norbert Ostrowski","I was researching automotive stylist Norbert C. Ostrowski and discoved that some of his sketches are featured in this book under the misspelling ""Ostrouski."" His sketches are shown on pages 10 and 96. Many of the photographs were taken at the Plymouth Road studios of American Motors Corporation. There is no index nor table of contents in the book which would have improved the book's value as a reference for those researching automobile styling. The author, Zinn, also wrote ""Javelin Photo Archive: From Concept to Reality"" which also shows the work of Ostrowski / Ostrouski.Javelin Photo Archive From Concept to RealityFor American Motors fans, another book that was done for the school market is ""What Happens in a Car Factory"" by Arthur Shay.What Happens in a Car Factory."
2,Bones cards were helpful; muscle cards were not,"I am just finishing up a semester of undergraduate nursing/pre-OT anatomy and for my purposes would rate the bones cards 3 stars and the muscle cards 2 stars. The bones cards were helpful, although I later purchased the Barron's Anatomy Cards and found them to be more helpful (in color and include all body systems). The muscle cards were useless to me because they have each muscle isolated on its own card. Useless for a lab practical in which you have to identify muscles on a model - lying next to or underneath other muscles. It's too bad the author couldn't have included cards with all the muscles of a particular area together - muscles of the deep anterior forearm, for example."
3,It's Ok!,"When I received the flashcards, I was rather disappointed by the boring outline in the back of the flashcard and by the monotonous coloring of the parts of the sketetal and muscle systems. It doesn't make things fun to learn by adding mnemonics devices or even some creative flair to it! It is a flashcard by all means. It has one side blank with a diagram and the other side with info such as origins, insertions, and the definition itself. Additionally, it has a table of contents. Some of the diagrams are really unclear though. Well, you will learn something from these cards, but to a snoozing point!Good luck!"
3,Okay...needs more than one muscle,"These are okay, but it would be nice to have a few other muscles pictured (but just grayed out or something) to show its orientation with other muscles in the area."
1,-Not Real Pictures,"Well i was anticipating better pictures, along the lines of computer generated, kind of like what you see in a text book. Instead these look like crappy hand drawn pictures, granted that all the info in the card are accurate its hard to distinguish the bones and muscles."
3,Great but very advanced!,These are great but very in depth. So much more than I needed for anatomy and physiology class. But great non the less.
3,Muscle Bone combe flash cards,This has been a very frustrating purchase ... the cards are fine and a good study guide but I was under the impression that I was purchasing a NEW PRODUCT and there are several cards missing that are criticle to my studies
5,Quick shipping,I was vcry happy as I received my purchase within a week! Thanks so much....I know that I will be ordering again in the future.
5,"write protection, stays closed","This is my 6th flash driveand the first with captured USB connector coverwhich actually stays closed.I hang my thumb drive on a lanyard,and this is only the second physically sturdy enoughto not break off.I occasionally need to plug drives into others' Windoze PCs,too many of which are infected and/or configured to write thumbnailsor otherwise screw up directories, so write protection is a must.Write protection is impossible for me to switch by fingernail,requiring a toothpick or other probe;that is the most prominent downside encountered.Since the included encryption is software-only,I suggest instead using TrueCrypthttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt... which supports Mac and Linux as well as M$"
3,Difficulty applying to face.,"This mask is very DIFFICULT to apply to your face. It's made of natural products which is great, but this product was not effective as I wished. The people at Earthwise are very helpful and understanding and will refund my money. So really, try this mask out. You have nothing to lose"
5,"PERSON DEFENSE TV 2006 DVD , 4 SET.","[...]1 of PERSONAL DEFENSE TV 2006 Season DVD 4 Disc Set [ASIN: B001CY5KRGDVD's are professional produced, Very good, easy to understand techniques of handguns are taught.

4,"Interesting, but not what I had expected it to be","The show was interesting from looking at the DVD's. I didn't get the show where I live. I thought from all the reviews I had heard about it, it would be something that I would learn from and enjoy. I was not that impressed. It did have a lot of different things they talked about, so you have a choice to watch the whole thing or take a break and then come back and watch more. However it was worth what I paid for it."
3,Interesting twist on the Casino biz,"Interesting twist on the Casino biz.Sharon Stone MMMMM LOL!!Fun movie, with a fun no limit ending!!"
5,Humorous look at life for the 1st child after the 2nd one,This is a wonderful look at the forgetfulness and distractions of a new mother of 2.
2,Museum Piece Only,"I wanted desperately to like this one, but an old man singing unaccompanied--and not very well--is not easy to take. Nobody likes the old croakers more than I do, but this one was mainly amusing himself. Many of these songs have been sung by others and their versions are almost always vastly superior to those found here. What this set is valuable for is learning some old songs. Unfortunately, that is not enough to keep it in my collection."
2,First world mentalities,Telling about the third world countries based on their experiences for me some of it are true. But stating the conditions of the country that bad is sometimes quite far fetch. Most probably it is just to spice up the book for sales. Not all third world countries that bad for example getting away from problems with the law by bribing them. You may get in more trouble if you try to bribe the men in the uniform. That is the mentality of the first world countries. First world countries looking down at the third world countries. It is as if the people there aren't civilized yet.
2,Adventure Travel in the Third World Hype,"The newest entry into self-pretentious bombastic absorption is the collaboration of promoters Mr. Randall, and Mr. Perrin. These two people seem to have come out of nowhere and presented themselves as the grandiloquence of third world travel. The book ""Adventure Travel In The Third World"" is a good read but can be put together using cut and paste on your computer much cheaper. Scale of one to five I give it two stars for effort."
4,Nice tub file,"Arrived undamaged. Sturdy, good quality metal rolling tub file. The only assembly was attaching the rollers to the legs. Light taps with a hammer did the trick on those. The lock mechanism seems strong. The lid caught a bit when sliding it back until I laid a bead of light oil on the inside of the guide-tracks."
3,Received with a cracked caster.,"I managed to stuff the caster high up enough inside the bottom tube so the cracked part is not an issue. Other than cheap plastic on the casters, it's a good little rolling file cabinet."
2,Featherweight File,"The file arrived in a box that fell apart when we began opening it. There is a lower shelf. It arrived severely bent. This is a very thin-walled item. That's good if you have to move it around, because it is light, but not so good that it bends and distorts so easily. The lid works fine."
3,Braun Travel Alarm,I had a similar Braun alarm clock for many years and was very fond of it. It finally failed and I was pleased that they are again in production. I made a mistake and ordered the small travel version instead of the slightly larger model but the little one works just fine.
3,This is not the 3rd book,"Ok so everyone understand that this is the european version of the first book it is not the thrid book the thrid book will be coming at some point in the future, first it will be printed in Europe because that is where huntington lives then in 6 monthes to a year it should come to the USA if you can not wait that long order it from a european book store online"
3,Not the third book... probably,"I found Mr. Huntington's site, where it mentions book 3, titled Blood Moon, is ""coming soon."" My guess would be that Hellhole is the English title of one of the first two books but I can't be sure without buying it."
3,Decent foreshadowing book,This is a book about a mom and a girl that magically switch bodies. This book has alot of foreshadowing I cant say why becasue it gives away the end. I gave this 3 stars because itis a girl book. And I am a boy.
3,"Okay, so how many times have I seen this storyline?","Two people changing bodies. This has been the storyline for many books and tv shows for years. I think I am in need of something more unique. Although I have to admit,this book is not all that bad considering it used the ""done before"" plot. Mary Rodgers did a pretty good job at making this book more interesting than it would have been had it been written by an author of less skill. It won't hurt to read it anyway."
3,The Switched Bodys,"In the book called ""Freaky Friday"" there were a few funny things that occured. One funny thing was when Annabelle went to a French restaurant that she knew of and got a nice soup for lunch called ""tripe a la mode de Caen"" and I am still not sure how to pronounce it! Another funny thing was when Annabelle's mother went to the conference and she was already forty-five minutes late, but she still went. On the way there she met some of Annabelles's friends but didn't pay much attention to them. This book was an enjoyable and a very funny book!"
4,interesting story,"When Annabel Andrews woke up one day, she found out that she was in her mom's body. She has to do all the things her mom does like go to work and drive even though she does not know how. Her mom has to go to school as if she were Annabel. Her mom knows how to drive but she is not allowed because she is only 13, supposedly. . . . You will have to read the book to find out how this happens and how they solve the problem.I give this book 4 stars because it was boring on the first five pages. After the first five pages, the book got better because it had more adventure. It has an interesting story behind it."
2,Risque topics discussed,"I got this book on CD for my 9-year-old 4th grader to listen to in the car, and luckily, I was with her to review the content. I was surprised to hear of discussions about having a lover, strange diatribe on the word ""black"" to denote color vs. African-Americans, drinking, etc.Call me a prude, but I stopped the CD and got rid of it. There didn't seem to be enough edifying material to finish.I know that this book is listed at 10-years-old on up, so technically, my daughter is a tad young for the content of this book; nevertheless, I thought this book would be a bit more tween-friendly."
5,Fabulously Freaky By:AC,"This book, Freaky Friday, is about a mom (Tess) and a daughter (Anna) that fight constantly. The reason why they fight all the time is because Anna thinks her mom has the perfect life. Anna always says,""Mom you're ruining my life!"" Thats starting to get Tess really mad!They went to a chinese restaurant. They started to fight right in the restaurant!The waiter ask them if they would like a fortan cookie. They both took one. A sudden earthquak started to happen. Or maybe that just happened to Tess and Anna. In the morning they weren't eachother! They switched bodies! Will they ever switch back?"
1,Too Old Fashion,I think that this book is bad. It is WAY to old. Its kinda wierd that they are pretending to each(mom or Annabell) other that they were the other. I hated it. Also it was soooooo borring. The movie was way better.
4,A Very good Book,"Freaky Friday is a delightful book. Children maybe 9 years of age and up would like it. I reccomend you read the book before you see the movie. They are both very different from the other, and the book is better than the movie. It is both exciting and funny. You should read it soon!"
4,It was a cool book,Freaky Friday is a book about a girl that wakes up one morning and realizes she is in her mother's body.I really do recommened this book to people who like reading easy and funny book.
4,This book was great.,"I am not a very quick reader, so it usually takes me about a week to read a book. This book, I finished in a day. No kidding. I loved this book and would definatley recommend it."
3,WANT A CHEAP THRILLER!? READ THIS BOOK,"Freaky Friday is a great book about a little girl and a mother who hate each other and suddenly they wake up one morning and they are each other! They have to go about their entire day acting and being different people an on the way, they run into all sorts of odd situations.This was a great book that kept me entertained for hours and always kept me on my toes. It is kind of a suspenseful book and I would recommend it to people of most ages. Actually, I would recommend it to young children and teenagers.I enjoyed this book because it was more laid back than most books that I have read. It was somewhat of a children's book yet still is entertaining for most anyone."
5,A mother and her 14-year old daughter change places.,"The book Freaky Friday is a very funny and adventurous book. It is about a mother and a daughter who think their life is harder than the other one's is. So they somehow switch each other's bodies but not minds. The mother is the daughter for a day and the daughter is the mother for a day. After going on a wild and crazy adventure throughout the day, they realize that each other's lives and more difficult than they thought. I think this would be a great book to read if you are in the 4th, 5th, or 6th grade and you have a wild imagination. I really enjoyed this book."
1,Let this Roadrunner pass on by....,"Bought this case for transporting my keyboard from my house to church and back. Within 3 months, the fabric where the handle and strap are sewn started pulling away from seam along zipper. Took it to an automotive upholstery shop and a luggage repair shop. Both said it could not be repaired b/c it would continue to rip at the same points due to pressure. It's a bad design. Pass on this bag and invest a bit more in higher quality. Be sure to look for the pressure points and stitching around them."
2,Below Tamron standards,"Two for the price of one is not a good deal here. These are very cheaply made, substandard glass even for bargin glass. I could not wait to repackage and return them. Actually the very next day they went back."
4,Asafoetida,"There is a reason that this spice was known as ""Devil's Dung"". It has a very strong, fetid aroma before you cook it. However, once you fry it in oil, that smell changes into a wonderful, garlic-like taste with complex undertones. Use it sparingly until you are used to it. I have found it to be good with fried eggs, meats, and in marinades for beef and lamb. Just remember that it tastes very different once it is cooked."
4,Very necessary for the prepration of Ayervedic cooking,"This is a very important component of the recipe that I was making to change my health. The smell of the product is quite surprising, but it does waht it's supposed to do. It is a big change in spices for an American palate."
3,Good information but over-the-top,"Good information here, but it is over-the-top and the tone could be more reasonable. For instance, it says ""Some cities, like Portland, Oregon, have designated pesticide-free parks that are worth the trip."" Worth the trip?It also says that you basically need to get rid of all of your beauty products, because they are all toxic. Sorry to be the bearer of good news, but there are women who have worn makeup, had healthy babies, and then lived to be 100. Makeup will not kill you or your baby.I agree with David Ethan Zoller's review that the book promotes a bit of fear culture. Before reading this book, I was already an organic/vitamins/whole foods/acupuncture/chiropractic type of person, and yet this book has me terrified that everything in my house will kill my baby.Inhale. Exhale. Remind self that women have been having babies for years, in houses just like mine, and their babies are fine."
4,Incredibly useful resources and info on non-toxic & green baby items,"This book was filled with wonderful resources to environmentally friendly and non-toxic necessities for pregnant women and baby products. Out of over 12 books on pregnancy, this one was the only one which covered this very important topic."
3,A bit extreme,"I want to be as safe as possible but after reading this book, I feel as if I should live in a bubble! Everything is toxic and unsafe, I think you should use this book and pick and choose what you consider reasonable precausions. If you followed everything you wouldnt be able to function in society."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"This book has been a great resource in organic pregnancy. They even give websites and advice on where to shop for certain things. They don't speak over your head either, which I like. It is an easy read. Most def recommend!"
2,No surprises,"This book really did not have any new ideas. It seems it was a book put together without a lot of deep investigating into new ideas in the organic world. If you don't know anything about the organic ""world"" or are new to organic eating, maybe it would be ok for you. I think, and this is just one opinion, the word ""complete"" in the title is misleading."
3,It's good if you are clueless when it comes to Organic eating.,"If you feel like you need some help eating organic, even if you aren't pregnant this is a decent book. It gives some good online resources, and lays it out pretty well. I felt like there was a lot of fluff in it, I would have prefered a nice blueprint/outline that just gave me a checklist of what to do. I do better when you make it simple and this book doesn't really make it simple. It's ok. Would I buy it for full price? Never."
4,Can be scary,"This book may scare you a little if you are a worry wort! I think it is wonderful if someone could follow all these steps, but in my world it is nearly impossible! I do like knowing all that I should try to avoid, and going into my second pregnancy now I am being even more careful. There is tons of helpful information, and they help you distinguish all those tricky food labels. I really like the info on cosmetic products, it goes through ingredients and that is really hard to find! Overall, get it, but don't obsess over it!"
1,Too Vague,"I thought this book was too vague. I bought it in search of solid advice but was disappointed. For example, regarding whether or not to get the flu shot. Or for a specific brand for prenatal vitamins. No straight forward answer.I was behind shocked on pg 228 where they stated that schools do not allow kids that are not vaccinated, nor ""most pediatrician."" WTF!!!! And that not vaccinating our kids is a public health concern.And, oh yeah, those personal stories ... not everyone can just put in new floors on a whim t/o their home! Just and idea of the budget one would have to do some of the things mentioned in this book.If you are already buying mostly/all organics in food and cleaning products, then you will not find much new here. For someone transitioning to this lifestyle, they may get more use out of this book.I am returning this one!"
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this book hoping that it would provide realistic advice. Instead, the statements made in this book are unsubstantiated (the authors do not point to any scientific studies to back up their claims), and often directly contradict advice held by the mainstream medical community. My immediate reaction after reading this book 3 months into my pregnancy? The feeling that as a pregnant women living in a city, I am screwed no matter what I decide to do. If I decide to swim indoors for exercise to avoid exposure to air pollution which could result from running outside, well, that's a bad idea. If I decide to continue to work full time in an office environment, resulting in exposure to computers, printers, and copiers, that's a bad idea too.My advice is to steer clear of this book."
3,Surprisingly wonderful!,"I bought this CD on the basis of one tune 'Over the Bar,' which quite frankly is one of the most moving pieces I have heard in a very long time! That said, the other tunes are quite good too, though nothing like as powerful, and if they were, I would have no choice but to give this five stars. A good effort though!"
2,An exception to Tamron's quality lenses,"I was disappointed with this lens and eventually decided to return it. As the title of this brief review states - I hope this lens is the only exception to Tamron's quality lenses.The cons: 1. Zooming ring is very stiff, so much so that it becomes a real problem; 2. Lack of sharpness, regardless of focusing mode. I shot a few hundred images with this lens and all looked too soft; 3. Most images came out darker or lighter than what you would've expected, regardless of WB or exposure settings. 4. Grainy pictures even in perfect shooting conditions. And lastly there was 0 pop to the images - even a picturesque scene would look dull and flat.This lens needs to be redesigned from the ground up IMHO."
4,Very good,"The book arrived very soon, within 3-4 working days and was in good condition as described with highlighting in yellow. Can deal with this seller for books."
5,First Time Charm!,"Christopher Awdry's first book is great! Thomas helps the police find the Stationmaster's stolen gardening tropheys, Percy helps a Postman get his van back, Duck sorta helps Henry up a hill, and they have to pull the express while Gordon is ill. Great book! Hope you enjoy it!"
3,sshhh...there's something out there...,"this is a ""candlelight romance"" book but,it READS like a gothic.christina's fiance(howard) has returned from vietnam a changed man. one day he vanishes and christina sets out to find him. she has tracked him to skye manor-a place the locals are somewhat afraid of because strange things are afoot there.christina braves her fears to reach out to howard and in the process involves herself with a new man and a mystery from the past. what will happen to christinaand howard? who/what is the mysterious thing that attacked christina's dog and killed a local girl? read it and see. this was a pleasant diversion."
2,Kinda predictable,"The preview of the movie was better than the movie. Kinda predicable, with sets of parents being gay. Sorry watched once and will not watch again."
3,Tru Loved,Ordered this DVD because of Jasmine Guy. It was really a very good film. Glad that I saw it.
1,Not up to the quality of Natural History of the Senses,"One of my favorite books is Natural History of the Senses by Ackerman. I was looking forward to reading this book and am struggling to get through it. I can not put my finger on what it is that puts me off. It is well researched and has lots of historical information, but it is dry and somewhat repetitive."
3,A Love Supreme??,"While I found this book to be very informative, I think that the title can be misleading.I'll explain. When I saw ""Natural History of Love"" I expected a treatise on all the forms of loving known to us: We have brotherly love, love towards the parents and love towards the sons and daughters, the love of God, the love of oneself, the love for an ideal and, of course, love between men and women which is the motor of our permanence as a species in this world.The thing is, this study made by Diane Ackerman is complete in terms of exploring the romantic/erotic phase of love (generally heterosexual) but it fails to expose the other types that I already mentioned. So my advise is: get this book if you want to deepen into the historical and psychological nature of that Saint Valentine's sort of feeling. But if you want to go deeper into the topic, please read ERICH FROMM's ""THE ART OF LOVING"". You won't be disappointed."
4,Consistently reliable fishing line.,"I have been using Berkley Trilene big game fishing line for over 15 years. It has always performed exceptionally well. I like its enduring strength and flexibility. I use mainly 40lbs test line in exclusively salt water for Striped Bass and Blue fish and have never felt that I should have been using some other line. The only negative about this line is that it retains more memory then I would like. But that being said allot of other lines that I've tried in the past had similar problems without offering the other positive characteristics of this line. So until something better comes along, I will continue to use Berkley Trilene Big Game line."
1,Curled forever.,"When we "" tried"" to put the line on our trolling rods/reels penn 301s. I use this term loosely, it did nothing but curl, bind and create birds nest. Usually this brand is one of the best. I feel that it wasn't the brand, but was old line. Maybe sitting on the shelf for too long causing the irreversible twist that could not be forgotten"
3,good for ideas,"Bought so I could get some ideas on things to do with the body bar, and thats about all I can use it for. The workouts are difficult and fast. If you are in great shape already then it is fine, otherwise I would not recommend except for exercise ideas."
2,Microsoft 5000 laser mouse,"I just purchased this mouse. It has a good feel. It does not scroll as smoothly as I would like. Contrary to what Microsoft says, the buttons are not programmable -- you have to select from a predefined list. I chose to use the small silver buttons on the side as ""copy"" and ""paste"". Neither one works.Another irritation, I am already getting a popup that says the ""signal"" is weak -- about 18"" away, yet the menu says it is fine I got a great buy on it at OfficeDepot (half price), otherwise I would return it."
5,Works Great,"If i were to buy another however, I would go with a mouse that just needs a usb drive instead of a whole separate unit that must sit on my desk. oh well!"
1,mediocre mouse,the scroll button does not work consistently for scrolling and as a middle button. the right silver button is awkward since you have to move your entire hand to look for the button in order to press it. there is very poor precision with use to control the onscreen pointer.conclusion: look elsewhere and find a much better mouse.
3,WEAK SIGNAL,"mouse works fine except signal strength routinely comes in low and generates a ""low signal strength"". r2 batteries, relocate rcvr, reposition rcvr, invert rcvr ect take care of the problem, till the next day..."
2,A waste of money,"When compared to the several prior Microsoft 'mice' I've had, this one is pretty sad as far as performance goes. It is not responsive and it is not accurate no matter how you change the settings for it. The 'invisible laser' feature of it, makes it necessary to use a mouse pad, where prior ones with regular lasers, worked excellent on any surface. This mouse will quickly be replaced."
3,Get physical,"My Laser 1000 broke so I bought this as a replacement. Then I bought the Laser 7000. Then I bought the Laser 6000... Someday I will learn not to buy a physically-used device w/o physically trying it first, lol! (You can always buy it online when you get home.) At least now I know I have working spares."
1,Avoid this mouse!,"This mouse worked well for a couple of months but I began experiencing low battery signal messages, low signal quality messages (even though the receiver is less than a foot away and I replaced the batteries many times). The software on my computer is the latest Microsoft offers. Then, I began seeing huge delays in response to scroll wheel movements and clicks, although mouse movements were normal.Something is wrong with this mouse or the software it relies on.I am running Windows 7-64bit.I'd look elsewhere."
2,"Not really ""wireless""","I've used the Microsoft Wireless Optical mouse in the past, and decided to go in for a similar Wireless Laser Mouse. Although the pictures show the mouse without wires, they miss out on the fact that the USB transmitter required for the mouse is WIRED! There goes my dream of de-cluttering my laptop bag. Having used the Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse in the past, I expected a similar setup where the USB transmitter fits into the bottom of the mouse and saves space. No such luck. I now wish I had researched for a truly wireless mouse, 'coz this one just doesn't help. Also, I find myself accidentally clicking the magnifier buttons on the side when moving the mouse, which is annoying. Overall - as a product from Microsoft that is a supposedly wireless - a disappointment."
2,low power,"I don't like it because it is always saying ""low power"" and I do every thing it said to trouble shoot the problem with out and luck fixing the problem!"
1,DEAD SOLDIER,I RECEIVED THIS MICROSOFT PRODUCT D.O.A. ! THE LIGHT NEVER LIT AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE FAULT OF THE BATTERIES OR THE MOUSE. I WILL BE RETURNING IT AS I HAVE ORDERED ONE FROM BEST BUY THAT WAS ON SALE. IT DOES NOT USE STANDARD AA OR AAA BATTERIES. SO GETTING BATTERIES FOR THIS MOUSE WILL NOT BE EASY. AGAIN - I WILL BE RETURNING THIS MOUSE. A.S.A.P.
1,Terrible for gaming,"CONS:- A few weeks after buying this mouse it loses a lot of precision and sensitivity.- Cursor doesn't respond well to mouse movement. Even with brand new batteries, the cursor movement doesn't sync well with mouse movement.- It gets lots of low signal warnings, even with new batteries.- The mouse feels uncomfortable and clumsy, I have to give my wrist a break every 20 minutes.- Feels like the mouse was designed and made by amateur engineers.- There is a huge wired receiver you plug into USB. So you actually have 2 mouses on your desk. But even with such a large receiver the signal sucks.- The generic mouse I've used at work for 3 years works better than this.- I am replacing this mouse 6 months after buying a new one, even though I wanted to replace it within the first month.- The middle mouse button doesn't respond well when I push it during gaming, so I can't use it and the button is wasted.PROS:- NONE, I hate this mouse and am angry I wasted money on it."
1,Heavy mouse losses signal pritty often,"I have been using this mouse for the past one week and i hate it already, the grip of the mouse is good but for moving the mouse you feel it is heavy becoz may be using 2 batteries but still it losses the signal and it won't work on any surface means on a cloth or on a sofa cloth i mean my prevoius optical mouse use to work on almost any surface this is kind of crazy with this mouse..... and most importantly i don't like the left side button the extra button will get clicked if you try to lift the mouse and when you are browsing something it goes to the back page...iam annoyed with this mouse and iam trying to get a new one..... if you want a lighter mouse which doesn't loss signal and which can be worked on any surface i do not do not suggest you this mouse ......... well the final decision is on you guys."
3,Does not work with Windows 7,Would not install on computer with Windows 7. Directed to Microsoft site and no fixes were available.
4,Almost perfect,"I love that this mouse has the buttons on either side to go back and zoom. However when I ordered this mouse I anticipated that the left side button would go back, which it does and the right side would go forwards, which it does not. I'm not sure if this could be a software thing or what. It would be 5 stars if both buttons worked as stated above."
1,Returning It - This thing is garbage,"Well, if you ever wondered what it would be like to click four or five times whenever you wanted to do something on a computer, this is your mouse. It just ""feels"" awful. I was thinking something was wrong with my PC so I hooked up another mouse. So I began doing a lot of troubleshooting. The problem was this piece of crap. It rarely responds to a click in one try, so you end up hammering away at the button with your finger like a woodpecker. Sometimes it moves the cursor when you move the mouse, sometimes it doesn't. Basically it makes everything you do more difficult.Buy ANYTHING else. It certainly couldn't be any worse. Even as I'm selecting the number of stars to give for the attributes this hunk of trash is making me hit the link over and over again."
2,Definately a Microsoft product,"There is no doubt this is a Microsoft product. It stops working for no apparent reason, and works again after you reboot the computer, which of course, has to be a hard shutdown as the mouse doesn't work. Somehow it also screws up any other mouse as it doesn't help to change mice or unplug and try to use my mouse touch pad as nothing works once it shuts down. I have needlessly replaced the batteries four times to make sure it wasn't them. Since it has an invisible laser, you can't tell if it simply shut down, died or what. The only cure has been to keep rebooting the computer which is, as we all know, very frustrating, especially since I can't save anything. I have been reading about 'sleep' problems and although I don't have the same symptoms, it does seem like it quits working when I leave and come back, giving it time to try to sleep."
2,mouse,The mouse seems to lose connection very easily. I bought the Micrsoft wireless laser mouse because I thought that it would work better with microsoft xp. I tried a different USB port and have change the batteries. It keeps losing connection.
2,It needs an overhaul,"I've had this mouse for 6 weeks now. I've had to disable the small buttons on the side because they get clicked accidentally very easily. This can be terribly annoying, not to mention it kills most games, especially if it is left as the default ""activate magnifier"" setting.I've also had the ""weak signal"" error mentioned previously, and many a false alarm on the low battery detection. Neither one should activate since my sensor base for the mouse is only 18 inches away from it.The most annoying fault is that it only seems to catch about 75% of the button clicks. You never know if you've activated a slow process or if the mouse just went deaf again.I use Vista on my computer, I don't know if any other O/S'es have the same problems.Other than that it's a comfortable mouse to use ergonomics-wise."
1,Not worth,"the item shown on the web like a wireless mouse , that is the reason i purchaged by putting lot of money ($19). for this prce wired mouse is very cost.i wont prefer to buy."
2,Large Reciever,"I bought this wireless mouse to use with my laptop for college, I didnt know when I purchased it, but it has a HUGE reciever that is attached to the USB that is about the size of the actual mouse making it very difficult to transport with my laptop, wish the site would have mentioned this..."
2,Flaw: No way to custom program the tilt-scroll wheel.,"The Microsoft Wireless Mouse has all the good features going for it except one: MS does not allow custom programming of the tilt-scroll wheel for different applications. This was the one important feature my husband required for his new mouse. We ended up returning the one we got.For a 5-button tilt/scroll wheel optical mouse (not wireless though they are available) that allows custom programming of ALL its buttons, including the tilt/scroll, consider this:Logitech MX 400 Performance Laser Mouse"
5,Great Wireless Mouse,"I had a logitech wireless mouse and it worked great, but battery life was poor. This mouse works great and battery lasts much longer."
5,MS 5000 Mouse,"I love this mouse; this is my second of these. I ruined my first one, so I just had to get another."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!,"I just love my new cordless mouse!! It feels so comfortable in my hand, and is definitely ""ergonomically correct."" I would definitely recommend it to anyone who works at their computer all day long as I do! I especially appreciate the ""magnifier"" button for small print. I love Amazon -- they always have the best quality products and excellent customer service."
4,"To all who have ""low signal"" problems","I replaced two Intellimouse Explorer mice with a pair of these and over all I'm fairly pleased considering the fact that I only paid $20 ea. The biggest issue was the ""low signal"" messages. I shut them off but the whole thing still annoyed me. A download of the latest Intellipoint software solved the problem. Signal strength is now ""5 bars"". So....Pros-Longer battery life, smooth scrolling, good for both righties and lefties.Cons-third and forth buttons are poorly placed and awkward. Microsoft obviously knew about the erronious low signal warnings but chose not to inform customers via website, email or any other means. Microsoft's customer support for both hardware and software is abysmal. Basically it's ""You bought it, you own it you're on your own"". Unless of course you're willing to shell out even more $ for the crapshoot of so called ""customer support""."
2,Microsoft wireless laser mouse 5000,"This is a nice hefty stabile handfull of a mouse. A five button mouse it ain't!The two side buttons need to operated by pushing them sideways. That requires holding the mouse on the opposite side to hold the mouse still. The result is that both side buttons get activated at the same time. The same holds true for the sideways scrolling. When scrolling sideway you need to stabilize the mouse from moving sideways and you wind up hitting one of the side buttons at the same time. As a five button mouse it is really badly designed.However, if functions very well as a two button mouse with a scroll wheel.I have set the right side button to do nothing so that I can use the left side button to perform tne back function."
3,"Decent Mouse, Nothing Fancy","This is a decent mouse for the price. I paid $19.99, no tax no shipping. I bought this mouse to replace the Laser 6000 mouse I had. I have the Laser 6000 mouse/keyboard combo. After 4 years the mouse has been defeated but the keyboard is still great. I bought the Laser 5000 and was able to sync it to the Laser 6000 base. The Laser 5000 Mouse and the Laser 6000 Keyboard work perfectly together."
2,One Bad Feature,"I work in AutoCAD and use the scroll button to pan frequently. The push action on the scroll button is terrible. You have to push it just the right way to get it to work. Seems like something that could definitely be improved upon. Other than that, it works great."
3,"Average battery life and signal but,","The main thing that is wrong with this mouse, or at least mine, was that it cannot work on white or bright surfaces. It is really picky about the surface texture that its on, a slightly lumpy or dirty desk will eliminate nearly all usability. Also, the scroll wheel became stuck and unusable after six months. Bad luck perhaps.The battery life on this is its best trait, along with a good feel and weight. It doesn't feel like it's a cotton ball or a brick. The side buttons are convenient; good for shortcuts.It serves as a decent mouse with good battery life and okay signal reception. However it does not last and is too sensitive with surfaces so I don't recommend this mouse."
5,Love it,"I love this mouse and for the price, in my opinion, is a great value. I've had two of these mice for several years and have used them extensively. Just lately I've had to push a little harder to get the right click to work. Still use them every day."
1,Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 5000,I am a small person and this mouse is too big for my hand. Everything else about this mouse is great but I wanted to share my opinion for all of you with small hands.Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 5000 - Metallic Black (63A-00001)
1,Scroll Wheel doesn't work right,"Get what you pay for. It's $11 for a reason. The wheel was flawed in the one I used. Oh, you could scroll through documents, if you spun the wheel with your free hand. It didn't matter what the settings in software were, same result. So far MS has made the best mouse I've ever used, the wired Laser Mouse 6000, and the worst, this mouse. Don't buy this mouse."
2,Performance is unreliable,"I bought this mouse at a brick and mortar store, at first it seemed to work ""okay"", but I noticed that the mouse would not respond right away and it ""slows"" down when you are moving the mouse. I've update the software, etc etc but I still have problems. Apparently, many thing can interfere with the signal between mouse and PC. Fluorescent light and baby monitors interfere with them. I bought another mouse (that I will not name) and it works much better. Save your hard earned money and buy a mouse ONCE!"
5,I am very pleased with this mouse.,I have been using this mouse for around a week now and so far I love it. I have found the precision is very good which makes it easy to navigate with. The design is very comfortable and I can actually move the mouse easily without constantly hitting the 3rd and 4th buttons. Overall I highly recommend this mouse.
1,Very Bad Mouse,"I bought this mouse one month ago from local Staples. But I should say this mouse is one of the worst mouse I've ever used.It can only work awkwardly in the table with a mouse pad. It can not be used in my bed at all (whereas my Logiteck V450 works perfect).As for the mouse itself, it has a strong plastic feeling that will let you feel like holding a toy.I will not recommend this mouse to anybody. I am going to see if I still can return this mouse to MS."
2,Good while it lasts,"The scroll wheel failed on not one, but two units - locked up so severely that it became useless. If you don't use the scroll wheel, this mouse *might* work ok for you... that was the only problem I encountered, but a dealbreaker for me."
1,Piece of junk mouse,"I've had two of these creatures and they are rodents, not mice. Frequent signal failure. Cursor jumps. Sudden speed up. Worst thing is the scroll wheel. On both mice it got increasingly harder to turn, resulting in inadvertent clicks, data loss, and other problems. I thought the wheel was dirty, and discovered there is no way to actually open the mouse. Eventually the thing became completely unusable, and I pried the top and bottom apart, thus destroying it, but I didn't care about that anymore. To my surprise, the wheel was not dirty at all. However, what I discovered is the thin layer of lubricant that goes between the scroll wheel and its hub was viscous and sticky, and that was what made the wheel hard to turn. The lubricant, in other words, was some form of glue. So, big congratulations to the Microsoft engineers (and you know what else they make) for their thoughtful design. I'm out $100 on both rodents, and MS gets no more $$ from me."
1,Possibly good mouse.... poorly designed receiver.,"Bought this to replace my ailing Logitech wireless laser mouse. Got the MS 5000 back to work, opened the box, IMMEDIATELY closed the box and took it back to the store I bought it from.The receiver is not one of the small usb designs that looks like a flash drive. It is a large receiver that is about as big as the mouse. It then has a long cord that goes to the usb connector.This may be good for desktop computer use but if you're going to use with a laptop, buy something else."
4,A mouse with good and bad points.,"I like the feel of the mouse and the multiple configurations from the software. I originally thought the smooth wheel would be a good feature. I don't know if I like it as well as the wheel with detents. It takes some time to get used to it. I had to disable the right side button. For me it's too easy to accidentally click. The sending unit is as big as a normal mouse. I tried to mount it under my wood desk about 24"" away. The mouse would require multiple clicks to respond. I moved it on top of the desk under the monitor. Now it's very responsive at 16"". I haven't used the tilt wheel much because I forget it's available. Old habits die hard."
2,Not reliable,The buttons are intermittent especially in game play. You can not set the middle mouse button similar to a regular mouse and it is not recognized in some games at all. I'm using Vista 64 and frustated as hell with the mouse. The default magnification came on and I could not turn it off...again intermittent buttons....or could it be wireless reponse time?
3,Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 5000- Metallic Black,As good as most of the other cordless optical mouses and the price was right. You would have to spend a lot more for one with a greater range.
4,*crosses fingers*,"With the bad reviews of them tearing easily, I hope these will atleast last one night for this costume party I'm attending. I got size D which is the biggest size they have. I'm a 16 and curvy. They fit fine which is what I was most concerned about"
3,They're fine,"I bought these for a costume and they were rather comfortable to wear all day. They are shimmery, which is great. They were comfortable but they seemed to run a little small, and the color of my skirt bled on to them and I had to throw them away after one use."
3,"Decent, but tend to tear quickly","These are pretty nice, but they tear in the crotch area very fast. If you have a big butt, even if you have slim thighs, then you might have some issues with durability. Very nice color/tone though."
3,Long legged ladies beware...,"If you've got an inseam over 30"", you'll struggle to keep these up. Otherwise, they're pretty comfortable, and the shimmer finish is pretty cool."
2,Poor quality,Croch got holes in it first time. Poor quality I have a pair that is 3 years old that still have no holes.
3,Just OK,"Even though I am within the height and weight guideline for these tights, as always, if you have full legs like I do, you will struggle to get these to fit in the crotch, although after you have worn them once or twice it gets a little easier. I truly wish they would make hose and tights for women like me that have full legs, even when I was 130 pounds I had the same problem with all panty hose and tights."
1,Danskin tights,"I used Danskin tights for 20 years & couldnt believe when they went out of business in Las Vegas, NV! I purchased a few pair online for my GF & I...both of ours(different sizes) were ripped out of the box! I still have a pair that I havent opened bcuz I believe they will be the same way...very disappointing from such a reputable company!!!"
4,Breathable,"I purchased this product a while ago for my work, and daily wear.things i liked about this product are breathable, durable.interesting fact is i am still using this pantyhose after months. great product"
2,Too dark,Too dark for light toast. I was looking for a color just a bit darker than nude. I will keep looking. Capezio seems to be a better choice.
4,Awesome tights for costumes,"I was looking for tights to wear with my costume. I live in NY and wanted them to be thick enough that would be keep me warm but not old lady like looking. They looked great, very shimmery and made my costume look amazing. Recommend!"
3,Too heavy,"It is a good idea, but it is actually heavy, a lighter material should be used instead of wood for the handle.The price unbeatable."
5,useful,"I like it for the outdoor windows, because i can carry it up ladders without getting tangled up on a long pole and it has both the spngey side and the squeegee in one tool. Just have to do some reaching!"
1,I want 80 minutes of my life back,"Supposedly based on the Bell Witch Haunting of the early 18th Century, this starts off well but quickly goes off the beam so far that the term 'based on a true story"" should almost be viewed as false advertising.The plot goes off on a tangent that it is all caused by the father molesting his daughters and the ghosts of another girl is forcing the issue into the open.This may be ok for a horror movie but it's not that scarey and there was never even a hint of this in the real tales about the Bell Witch. what might have saved this is more done with the contemporary horror tale that book ends the 'real' haunting. in all, it wasn't scarey, wasn't worth the effort."
2,A Textbook Lesson In How To Ruin A Sure-Fire Great Horror Story,"This movie was mostly just a waste of a viewer's time. It had little to do with what is known concerning the actual Bell Witch events, it employed clichéd horror film elements to insultingly poor effect, and worst of all, it might well have slandered members of the Bell family, who though long dead, of course, don't deserve to have such harsh accusations made about their conduct and character by makers of a movie that touts itself ""based on true facts."" This film's one saving grace was its use of its sets and setting. It looked much like Tennessee of that period surely did, even if the unmistakably modern actors often did not. An American Haunting could have been a classic but as presented it is a waste of time."
1,BORING!!!,"This movie was sooo boring, I couldn't even finish it. It was as if they filmed ONE scene of this girl being assaulted by the invisible ""witch"" and then replayed it 20 times over without actually moving the story forward. This movie made 83 minutes feel more like three hours. I got two loads of laundry done while fidgeting through it, I tried to hang in there but I quit long before what I'm sure was a huge (according to previous reports.) revelation."
2,The Movie Exagerrated,"An American Haunting is based on the Bell Witch, of the Bell Farm in Tenessee. The witch is said to haunt the place and ""torture"" the bell family, mostly John and Elizabeth, known as 'Bestsy', by slapping her, etc. In the movie, it is said that the 'ghost' was just Betsy's ""innocence"" that haunted the family after John Bell raped her. That is not true, the witch was there for a very long time, back when the indians/Native Americans roamed there. The movie had exagerrated way, way too much, but it was still ok."
4,Gothic flavor,"It's been a while since I've seen Sissy Spacek in a horror film and I must admit I got a nostalgic 'Carrie' twinge with her performance as a mother of a young girl who seems possessed by an entity. This movie has a gothic, dreamy flow reminiscent of 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' type of tale. Starting out in modern times, we are soon taken back into the 1800's with the discovery of an old journal. The mystery of the early haunting of the Bell family may explain the the night terrors experienced by the modern teen and unravel the cause. Being based on the true story of the Bell Witch of Tennessee makes the movie even creepier.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,DVD Special Feature Abuse Alert,"I couldn't believe the poor decision making skills of this director, most of which have been well detailed already, though I was particularly stunned at his choice to include numerous, over-long, nearly identical ""alternate"" scenes and endings, and then his inability to stop himself admitting to planting good reviews on message boards, then indulging in a neurotic yet boring tirade on movie critics in place of a director's commentary. (I guess even HE didn't have much interesting to say about the movie.) Oh, but that random girl sitting next to him in the back of the car (where he performs his short oration with the explanation that, what with technology and all, you don't have to sit in a boring old office anymore! it's so much better to be out doing stuff!) looking out the window and not saying anything? She was really pretty.I couldn't stop watching it all though, as one would a train wreck."
2,Oh so bad compared to the book & Spoiler!!,"I was extremely diassapointed. The Bell Witch had a distinct character, voices, and was very loud. This movie made her out to be some whispery thing. I think they over focused on the rape in the movie, and I had no clue of it until the very end in the book. They made the entire movie about it.As someone who was from that area in TN and heard stories about the witch all through my childhood and read An American Haunting I thought it was a bad representation of the whole thing and really silly."
2,Never finished,"I was really excited about this film, but when I finally got to see this movie, I was deeply disappointed.Its an incredibly short film considering its subject matter, but that is definately a blessing for those of you whom do make it through. Why you may ask? Because those 83 minutes are the longest 83 you will ever sit through. I nearly fell asleep watching this film in the middle of the day, I turned it off halfway through and felt no need to turn it back on.I may try to finish it sometime later, I generally do. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, except those with considerable patience."
2,"Same ole ,Same ole","Yet another psychological thriller bare of logic. This film comprises of loud noises, loud computer generated screams that are really getting to me and the ever present little girl in a white dress with long black hair over her face efect wich seems to be in every movie nowadays.But it will say that Betsy Bell was tormented by the spirit to such a degre that i felt for her.I wont go into a synopsis of the film because Amazon does it qute well.If you are a fan of psychological thrillers you've probably see this film 100 times before under a different name with different actors if you get what i mean.seriously not recommended."
2,borin' 'n' ain't scary at alllllllllllll.............,the whole movie is all 'bout a girl who got assaulted by that witch who swore 2 get her revenge on the girl's father so spirits started slappin' the girl 'n' kickin' her back 'n' forth 'n' pullin' her 'n' pushin' her i feel that was the whole movie all 'bout i was waitin' 4 some other scenes cuz what the spirits did 2 the girl wasn't scary at allllllllll......think 'bout it twice or more be4 buyin' it.................
5,This is the movie for you if...,"...you enjoy every nuance not being handed to you on a silver platter. It's not The Ring or The Exorcist. There is no gore or creepy little girl. This movie makes you think and gives another possible excuse used to condemn another for witchcraft. If you don't get the modern day events seen only at the beginning and end of the movie, ask yourself what the journal (or something/one else)is trying to tell a divorced mother who has just kissed her troubled daughter goodbye and watched her ex drive away with her. I'm not implying all the strange happenings are easily explained, just that all is not what they may appear to be and there could be many things working (known and unknown) to make the story presented."
4,"""A Lesson of Understanding""","The movie gave me a sense of understanding what ""Haunting"" is all about. I began knowing things around me and when I go places. This a true movie."
2,An American Haunting,"A good movie, but not what I expected. Not one for children under 13 in my opinion because of how the story actually turned out. Involves incest which was unexpected."
4,A Frightfully Well-Told Tale,"There is nothing I can add to the Amazon snyopsis of the story. They did a great job there.This film is wonderfully and believably acted by all involved although both Sutherland and Spacek seem a bit too old for their parts. The photography is perfectly dark and moody for the time period and genre and the sound effects are very chilling and noteworthy. However, the special effects all have that been there, done that feel to them, but they are convincingly done. This isn'tThe Exorcistkind of scary, but it is an effectively eerie and creepy film."
2,Two stars is being generous,"This was a horrible movie. Not scary and yet still disturbing. Very little plot and no conclusion. Frustrating and confusing. Irritating. Oh, and if you find rape and incest disturbing, there's an added disgust factor (though thankfully no graphic images). There is no good reason to waste your time on this movie."
2,Okkkaayyy,"Not bad for a creepy movie but, if your looking for a film based off the Bell Witch this is not it. It just uses the outline of the story to add it's own story to it. Not so good."
5,FUN MOVIE TO WATCH ON A RAINY NIGHT!!,"I can't wait for it to be released on DVD. Ok, so it wasn't factual, but it was nonetheless entertaining. And it is CLEAN!! No profanity or obscene sex scenes!!!! That merits five stars alone these days. This is NOT a ""scary"" flick so to speak but more about the understanding of the real presence of evil that still exists in our midst. I found the whole movie quite fun to watch. It is packed with suspense and moves at a brisk pace. Let's not forget the distinguished cast led by Academy Award Winner and six time nominee Sissy Spacek. She is incomparable as Lucy Bell, the mother in the story. Spacek alone makes the film worth watching. No less superb is Donald Sutherland as her poor, bewitched husband. The girl who plays the daughter (I'm sorry I forgot her name) is also incredible. I don't understand why this movie is getting such a bad rap. I found it extremely entertaining and best of all I didn't hear the ""F"" word once! Bravo!!"
2,Unlike The Documented Accounts,"A lot of artistic license was taken here. I grew up in Tennessee with the ""red book"" account of the Bell Witch, and have been fascinated by it my whole life. I felt the handling of this movie was ridiculously Hollywood. Sissy Spacek was great. Everything else, dumb and focused on the less iimportant facts of this much-witnessed true story."
2,"Leave it on the shelf, not worth seeing","I must say, the only thing that attracted me to this was it was suposedly based on the bell witch story. this was not what I expected. Not a Horror, not even really intreaging, just plain slow, predictable, and I wish they had not had such big name stars like sissy spacek and donald sutherland, because it sucked me in to renting it. Who would have thought two legends would appear in this film. Then you realize, the directors were smart and knew what a bad film they had, so they had to attract people with smoke and mirrors. I say stay away from this one. Only redeaming quality in this is some nice camera work, and a few effects, but otherwise, a nap would be more productive and stimulating."
1,One word...crap,What I disliked about this film was the fact that it was turned from a movie about a haunting into a movie about child abuse. Not what I was expecting and not what I wanted to see.
3,"Pretty well done, slightly better than average.","""Hauntings"" are pure poppy-cock, so probably the only thing ""true"" about this is some old fart molesting his child. But as far as a hollywood haunting movie goes, this is pretty good.Video and audio are excellent and the pace of the movie is very good, but it's just the run of the mill scare tactics. Slamming doors, possession, fire blowing out... The most amazing part is that Betsy still looks so good despite night after night of being thrashed around!! Not a bag under an eye!"
3,not so bad but not so good,I wasn't very scary but it was very intersting I have never heard the story of the Bell witch so Iwanted to see the movie. Everyone is saying that this is nothing like the story but I still thougt it was ok. But I would wait for it to come out on video and save some money.
2,Not a horror movie,"This was packaged and advertised as a horror movie, but it really isn't. A modern day family is given a warning by a ghost from the past through a long and tedious flashback of bad events that happened centuries ago."
3,Scary as H###!,"Let me start off by saying, this was NOT my ideal film. Scary, yes, and I believe it was in fact based on a true story (which made it more scary!). Of course in order to properly document it's truth, the film makers had to go back to the time period in which it took place. I think that's where it did not sit well with me. I wasn't too interested in the old old time frame, ""way back when"" in other words. It was somewhat interesting, the acting was decent, and the movie itself had me sort of scared for awhile. If you're anything like me and don't like movies from the 1800's or whatever, don't waste your time with it. It was a halloween hit, and that's it."
4,its like really scary,"Whoa is all i can say. Its like really scary. it was so scary i had to run out of the theater to use the bathroom like twice. Thats how scary it is you know. Its all about this old dude whos family gets cursed becuase he charged to much interest on this land he sold to a witch--you really shouldn't mess with witches. Its like this one time on halloween when this little girl cam e to my house cuz im like a homeowner and she was dressed like a witch--no fooling!--and she asked for candy and was like ""no!"" i dont think kids should dress up like witches cuz im like a christian you know. Well anyway i said ""no!"" and she was all ""then you're gonna die!"" I got really scared and said ""OkaY! Take the candy take all of it!"" and gave it all to her. Long story short, she turned off the curse.i needed a beer after that.So anyway, this movies cool. Check it out."
1,Warning : An American Ripoff!!!!!!,"Where do I start? This film could've been so so so much better!! The costumes are great and the beginning is interesting as it starts in the present day and then goes back in time but the movie becomes boring very quickly and with the film being ONLY 91 minutes long you know you're gonna be bored very soon. If you're looking to be truly scared don't bother even wasting your $10 for this. Let's face it when you go to the movies to see a horror film you---well--- expect to be scared, -----not gonna happen with this film. I've seen the Bell witch story on the travel channel many times and that scared me 10 times more than this sorry excuse of a film to rip people off!!!! Hollywood has got to stop MISLEADING us to waste our money on films that are not what we expect to see. This film is about a girl who gets raped by her dad and because of this trauma she is the one who causes all the ""supernatural"" stuff. OOps i'v said to much. oh well at least I saved you some money."
3,Departs from the legend,"The movie will scare the heck out of you if you turn down the lights and you watch it at night, but it does depart from the original story in several parts. The ""witch"" in the original legend makes predictions about several major world events (which came true), hates the African America slaves and makes slurs against them, if you read the original books from the time, you will see all the differences. The movie also makes John Bell look like an incestuous child molester. I've been to Adams, Tennesse, the site of the ""Bell Witch"" and you do not want to make such inferences there, even two hundred years later! Most folks there believe the Bells to have been good folks. The molestation 'theories' have only surfaced in the last 10-20 years. But for sheer scariness the movie gets a three from me."
2,tedious and confusing,"This movie really made no sense. First off, there is no haunting. Second, there's no witch. Third, if the incidents were caused by a poltergeist, (i.e., the girl herself) why in the world was she torturing herself at first and not the person she really wanted revenge on. And why would it take a year after the first ""incident"" for the poltergeist attacks to occur. The opening, with the modern girl running in the woods from something was way too long and set the tone of the film: a lot of cheesy quasi terror scenes that don't make much sense and end up being boring. I love haunted house stories, but this was not one of those. There are far better haunting stories on Discovery's ""A Haunting"" series. Why is it that big budget films always seem to have lousy lame scripts which the directors try to compensate for by overproduction?"
1,"Ugh, this movie is terrible","I'm sorry to tell you that this movie was completely disappointing and I walked away feeling stupider than when I started. It was nothing more than an excuse to make a ""possessed person being exorcised"" movie that isn't effective at all, nor is the resolution in any way anything but a repulsive 'shocker' that was completely unnecessary. Don't bother."
2,Pretty forgettable...,"I liked the 1818 setting, but this movie just isn't worth watching multiple times. ""An American Haunting"" gives off that witchy-feel to it. It has a certain element of creepiness, except the thing is, it's not really scary. At all. It seems like some of the scenes where the invisible entity attacks the girl are trying to be as outrageous as the 1973 horror classic ""The Exorcist"". I didn't like how it shows the modern-day sequences, either. That was pretty cheesy and poorly acted. There are a few pros, but there are more cons. It was a poorly directed film. That's what I have to say about it."
3,An American Haunting,"In 1818, when a land deal between John Bell (Sutherland) and his neighbor Kate Batts (Brown) goes bad, she blames John for her problems. She then curses John and his family. When things start happening, especially to John and his daughter Betsy (Hurd-Wood), religious leader James Johnson (Marsh), and schoolteacher Richard Powell decide to help the family.""An American Haunting"" is based on a true story, but how ""true"" it is has been called into question. As a movie, it works fairly well, with a twist ending that is only somewhat satisfying. The wraparound story that feels tacked on serves no real purpose and should have been left out. Despite some good actors, the acting is nothing exceptional. Sutherland and Hurd-Wood have to carry the most weight as the haunted, but neither gives stand-out performances. ""An American Haunting"" is a slightly above average ghost story that is better off waiting for on DVD."
4,An American Haunting,"I liked the movie a lot. The book of the accounts, however doesn't have much in common with this movie though. For instance the witch did pull the covers off Betsy, and slap her and pull her hair at first, same with John, but slowly she calmed down, and at times was friendly to them. Years and years of this supposedly. Also no where that I read ever mentioned the sexual abuse, although I suppose it tidied up the ending explanation wise neatly for the movie."
2,Not worth buying,"The ending of this movie spoiled the movie beacuse it started of fairly well with some scary effects. Unfortunately, the movie exploits the Bell witch legend ONLY to make the claim that it was based on a true story. Whenever, Hollywood bases anything on a true story it ALWAYS means ""We'll butcher the true story/legend to make a quick buck!""In the end of the movie the Bell witch says that she never cursed John Bell. The filmakers opted for a more ridiculous ending which did not even involve a real ghost. After all, how can an entity be a ghost if the person is still alive?To summarize, there's a witch that doesn't even cast a stone, much less a spell, a useless present-day story addon, and a schitzophrenic pseudo-ghost. The real legend of the Bell witch is scarier and more satisfying."
2,A Sad Story,"The Bell Witch is a legend throughout the Southeastern part of the United States. It is rumored that Pres. Andrew Jackson confronted the entity. Of all the potential stories and variations possible for this legend, this movie obliterated the lore.Many people enjoy the folklore of the Bell Witch and the only known death attributed to a supernatural entity. The movie starts great with good characters, realistic performances, and great effects. About mid-way through, all that changes. Suddenly, the characters fall into aged stereotypes. You will probably already know what those are.The conclusion of the story is utterly predictable. This is a prime situation where they start with good intentions, but fall woefully short of the mark. It's feminism gone painfully awry and you wonder why on earth you wasted 90 minutes when the best part is the first 45."
2,A sleeper,"I wasn't too impressed with this movie, Im from TN so I've heard the tales of the Bell witch and the stories that I have heard. I thought it was going to be a more up to date account of the bell witch and not just glimpses of the presence. It had its moments but overall it was rather boring."
1,An Ok Scare,This movie has a twist to it that you won't believe butit is like out there and not really that scary.A ok movie but I don't care to watch it again.
1,New formula ineffective,"Method changed the formula of the Daily Shower. They called it: ""upgrade the daily shower formula to include powergreen technology, which is made of plant-based solvents."" It is most definitely NOT an upgrade. The product no longer works. The previous product (I found an old bottle during a move) kept my glass shower and tile clean and clear...the new formula however makes the shower glass streaky, there is now a white residue buildup on the tile that is not all soap, I think it is partially cleaner. I have been using the new formula for one week and am on the search for a new product that works. I would love for them to return to their original formula."
3,effective but not the most pleasant aroma,"I agree with most of what I have read here... the spray works well but I will not be drawn to other ylang-ylang products if this is what they smell like. It's not a bad smell, just an odd one. I like Method products in general, but most of them smell a whole lot better!"
2,"I'm in the ""smells sickening"" group","I bought this product a few years ago from Target, and I am so glad I don't have 8 bottles around! The smell is gross to me, and really lingers (all that hot steam), and after a while started to give me a headache. So I used it less and less, but then my shower was harder to clean. Yes, even spraying it every 3 days, and sparsely, helped with soap scum. But, my dog! that smell :-( For some reason I thought Method was specific to Target, and that this product was the only - not so! Duh. I found an Arm & Hammer version at Safeway - much better smell (kinda sweet and candy-like, and not great) and also works. I think there was another brand on the shelf which I will smell/try when I run out of my A&H. I DO like other Method products!"
3,This product confused me,I thought the purpose of a daily shower spray was to eliminate or minimize the physical maintenance of the shower. I found that after a thorough cleaning and then using this product liberally at the end of the week there was still a good amount of buildup on the glass and tile which required manual cleaning. What this product will do is make the shower smell great all day long but what this product will not do is eliminate the need for weekly manual cleaning. You make the call but I would pass on this item until the formula is modified to be more effective in reducing the need on manual cleaning further than the current formula.
2,"Other scent options, please!","Love how it works. But can't use it because the smell is just tooooo sweet. Would love to have the daily shower option in the Eucalyptus Mint Scent. (Or unscented, or grapefruit...something less cloying.)"
5,Love this little spray!,"I absolutely love this product. I've been using it for several years now and it has stood against the worst things I could throw at it. When I had roommates who absolutely refused to clean anything, they were willing to use this after their showers. Scrubbing the shower every two weeks after 3 adults used it daily was so much easier with this spray. I personally do not mind the smell, though ylang-ylang did take some getting used to with other products."
3,"Works well, but...","First off, this stuff does work. And it appears to be packed with less strange ingredients than my Scrubbing Bubbles or Tilex options.However, the smell is admittedly a little odd - like, mahogany and licorice, almost. And the spray handle broke in a week (which, judging from other Method products I've used, is probably a fluke, but something to note)."
2,Smell is overwhelming,"I generally love Method products, but the smell of this spray is just sickening. The only way I can stand to use it is if I spray the shower area, immediately leave the bathroom and shut the door (and make sure I've used the bathroom beforehand so I don't have to go in it for another couple of hours). The spray appears to *work* just fine, but the smell of it shouldn't be so noxious that I can't casually spray it on and do things in the bathroom at the same time."
1,love the brand. hate this product.,"Let me start off by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Method products. I use the detergents, all purpose cleaners, wood cleaner, tub and shower cleaner. When my dish soap and dish washer tablets finishes I'll buy the Method brands. The reason I gave this cleaner a 1 star is the smell. I don't mind the smell but its WAY too strong. I'm not a sensitive person but I almost choked spraying half the tub. I sprayed the whole tub, turned on the vent and went about my business for 1 hour. When I peeked my head into the bathroom an hour later I almost passed out! The smell was like I had just sprayed it! So this time I left the door wide open with the vent still on. Less than 10 minutes later my whole apartment smelled like the ylang ylang. I'm never spraying this again. I highly recommend other Method products though!"
1,PeeeUuuuuu! The new formula stinks,"We've been using this product for a couple of years now and really learned to love it. The ylang-ylang scent took us a while to get used to, but once we did we really liked it. (It's a strong scent and it reminded me of a spa we used to go to that used a lot of evergreen scents all around - a nice smell once you get used to it.) Anyway, we got our last shipment of 8 bottles a week or so ago and this new formula stinks - literally. I think it smells like old fish, my husband thinks it smells more industrial, but whatever it is, it's not good. I have to agree with the other reviewers that it also doesn't work as well. We cancelled our automatic shipments and will now look for something else. Bummer. We love method products in general, but the remaining 7 bottles will just go in the recycle bin."
1,Did not work for me,I could not get this product to work for me. This product had not impact on soap build up in the shower.
4,"Seems to work, smells strong","I just got the case of this stuff a week ago. I love that Amazon shipped it to me UPS for free to Hawaii! Anyways, we have used it for a week already. The smell is quite strong and personally I don't care for it. We use it on our cultured marble tub surround, curtain, and the tub which I think is plastic. So far it seems to be okay. I haven't noticed it getting cleaner, but that's probably because it was already clean to begin with. I'm hoping it helps cut down the soap scum and hard water that builds up.Since it smells strong and perfumey, kind of like what you'd imagine someone's grandma to smell like, we have to close the bathroom door so that we can sleep. There is a window in the bathroom, but I like to leave the door open so that there is a cross-breeze.I bought it because we are trying to be more eco-friendly and healthly too. I have a toddler too so I like to keep toxic things out of my house."
4,I like it!,I helps keeps the shower stall cleaner during the week when I don't have time to clean. Additional benefit is it smells good.
3,$2.99/bottle at Target,"I just bought this to try on my bathtub because we always get ""pink mold"" even though I clean our tub every 2 weeks. I heard this should be very effective against that. Will update on its effectively but in the mean time just want to let those who are interested that this can be found cheaper at Target"
4,This product is great!,"After not receiving the first shipment, we finally got our product. The 2nd time it arrived fine. We love it."
3,Shrug,"The ""authors"" seemed more interested in proving/preserving their street cred than presenting real information. They publish excerpts from a bunch of interviews and don't add any history, timeline, or additional material that would be useful to a person who wasn't there. Very few photographs. The gossipy scene stories are fun in a juicy way, but I bought this book wanting to know more about the actual musicians, how and why they wrote and played their music. I adore X in particular and really wanted to know more about bands I've only heard the names of before. This book is mostly about groupies, parties, the dives where people lived, and creepy managers--which isn't horrible, but isn't fabulous either."
3,Interesting....,I had mixed feelings about this book. On one hand it was interesting and I learned something about the LA Punk scene in the 1970's on the other hand I wanted more. It seemed to just skim the surface and some of the subjects in the book really were/are interesting enough to devote an entire book to. I wish it was more in depth.
2,Highly Overrated By Some...,"One thing that really comes through is that the people who put this ""book"" together are clearly jealous of the NYC punk scene, and the resultant book ""Please Kill Me"". They have reason to be: ""Please Kill Me"" is better edited and much more thorough...There are some great bands in here including X, the Runaways, Black Flag and Social Distortion, but their stories are glossed over, and told haphazardly--with a lot of the facts left out...That might've been (sort of) okay, but the book just isn't very entertaining. And, frankly, I felt ripped off....If the L.A. scene was indeed the equal of the NYC scene, this isn't the book that proves it."
3,A good read for anyone interested in early LA punk,"Well put-together exploration of the often overlooked early LA punk scene. My main critique of this book is it seems to gloss over, if not dismiss, many of the LA ""hardcore"" punk bands (Black Flag, FEAR, and the Circle Jerks for example) who, along with X, are really responsible for putting LA punk on the map.The earlier bands seemed to be following the lead of the early UK bands to a certain extent while the later bands are the guys (and gals) who created a sound, scene, and attitude markedly different from what came before.While it was great to see the Weirdos, the Germs, and the Runaways(!) finally get their due in print (it is the UNTOLD story of LA punk after all) the book dwells a bit too much for my tastes on the dreary, artsy-fart aspects of this early scene.But what the hell do I know? It's not like I was there."
2,Art and Homosexuals is not what I remember about Punk,"I had high hopes for this book. The History of Punk in LA! Man that sounded great. What I found was half the book was dedicated to the Glitz scene of the 70's. This book talked as much about disco and glitz as it did punk. I remember punk being hardcore, in your face agression coming from bands like TSOL, Black Flag, Fear, etc. These bands were covered as an afterthought. Instead I read all about how punk evolved from homosexuals and gay art. Gay art? Lots of coverage about Darby Crash but most focused on him being a closet homosexual. I was hoping for more info on the hardcore movement and reading about concerts at the Olympic Auditorium. Like I said, I was disappointed to say the least."
3,How Sad!,"I really like Brian Keith Jackson's writing, in ""The Queen of Harlem"" he has definitely demonstrated that he is growing as a writer. The storyline is easy to read and the characters (who all have major flaws) flows with the story as he builds Carmen up as ""The Queen of New York"" and you really like her style, I really liked that character, then in the end when Mason/Malik who is not an honest person with his friends or family, get caught up in his own lies and things don't go his way (spoiled rich kid), Mr. Jackson began to tear down the one redeeming character in the book. I liked the story and the characters, but you lost me on the ending, I was really disappointed. The whole book was a lie. Not my type of a read. Is this female bashing?"
3,What you see is NOT what you get!,"This is the first book by this Author that I have ever read. It is very well written. The author keeps the characters crisp and in sequence. The book flows very well. I esp. like the way the authors paints such graphic pictures about the scenes,places and charaters.It did however take me a while to complete this book. Approx 1 month. It is not what I would call a pageturner. I absolutley loved Mason. I would love to see his chracter in another book. If you are looking for something to read on a trip this would be a great read. The best part of the book was the ending. It was a total surprise ending."
5,Definite Pageturner,"I just finished reading this book by Brian Keith Jackson. I most definitely without a doubt will give it five stars. The story takes place in Harlem and is about a young black man trying to find himself. He meets a lady named Carmen and stays in her house with her under another name. Matter of fact, he lives a totally different life than the one he was raised up to have. It really starts to crumble when he meets a young lady named Kyra. An at the end there is a twist that you would have never guessed. I could really believe something like this happening in real life. Keep up the good work, Mr. Jackson. I will definitely check out his other titles."
4,Interesting,"This was a book that was assigned by my book club, a book I probably never would have picked up otherwise. The plot sounded good enough...and it didn't disappoint.The story was a short & sweet read, which worked. The only thing I would have added was a bit more description and experiences from the Harlem side of life. It would have been funny to have him move there & have to learn the lingo, the way of life. Instead, the person that he chose to live with had a background similar to his. I don't think the character really experienced what he set out to do.It was a good book though. I'd recommend it. Ending was a good as well!"
3,Interesting read,"This book was interesting for the most part. It was a real easy read. I did think however that the suspense could've been built up a little bit better, but it did keep my interest so I suppose that that was enough."
4,All Hail the Queen,"First, the great news. This is NOT another tired sistergirl book or all men are playas book. This is a really fine piece of fiction about a young man who heads to Harlem for the ""real"" black experience. Of course since there is no one real black experience you know that he's on a goose chase that will quickly get out of hand. Our foolish young hero changes his name and pretends to be a roun'tha way boy.He finds himself between two intriguing women. His landlady, whom he affectionately calls the ""Queen of Harlem"" and Kyra a young lady whose background is a lot like his real one. I loved everything about this book except for the whack ending. Oh well, it's still a four star book."
1,should be taken off the shelf,this missal is out of date and should not be sold anymore. there are more comprehensive and newer versions (and the vatican is publishing a whole new missal.
5,Great Reference Book,"This book is a very well written, easy to understand book. I live in NH and found this book to be quite handy in finding the out of the way locations that might not be found otherwise. This book is clearly written and very easy to understand. The directions are easy to follow and pretty accurate. All around great book to have if you want to see very nice areas of NH."
1,Doesn't cut it,"Ordered five of these to bore some holes in some rocks. I wanted the holes to be just about the size of the diamond tip on these bits, but they just couldn't cut the stone. Might work better on other materials, but on rock I had two of them break off in the hole while I was drill, and the little pieces of bit got so wedged into the rock I had to grind them out too. At least they were only a buck each. I've found the 1/8 inch ace brand hammer masonry drill bits to be more effective, but not fun to use."
2,No good for hard metals,If supposely it is carbide should work on hard metals. It broke while tapping the metal. Had to pay extra for a professional to do the job because of the poor quality of this product
5,great book for young boys,"Reading this as a kid is the reason I'm shopping for yet another bike at 54. A good book sticks with you, and this one has Nortons and Triumphs in it, and how do you beat that?"
2,NOT Grandma's Featherbed!,"I had hoped this would be the ""cloud-soft"" solution to waking with aching bones in the morning. It is NOT soft and billowy as it appears in the picture and it did not provide the comfort I was needing. (For the record, my aches and pains were greatly diminished by placing a memory foam topper on my mattress. It was 130 dollars at Costco, but turned out to be worth every dollar. Highly recommend as an alternative to this product.)Another family member tried this topper and woke up with scratches and irritation on his back. The sharp feather ends were working themselves through the topper cover and his fitted sheet. There seems to be a minimal amount of real down in this thing and a whole lot of broken feathers.The cheap price is tempting, but this product is an example of the wisdom of the cliche' ""you get what you pay for."" Stick to quality and pass on this bargain stuff. Sleep is too precious to lose."
3,"nice, but not ""just right"" Goldilocks says","As children, we had the heavy ticking feather mattresses. We would fluff them up at night and then jump into them. You stayed toasty warm - not too hot, but just right - and it was some of the best rest you had. You were cradled in the comfort and I would love to find that quality feather mattress again.This is nice, but not anywhere that heavy ticking. Okay, it has a few points that Grannie's lacked. There are sewed channels to keep the feathers from moving about, but hey, there is not foot high fluffing up and jumping into it either. The elastic corners to keep it in place is nice, but it's so lightweight. Why can they not make them with the ugly grey and white striped ticking?This is nice and it does help you rest, but not want I think most people are looking for in a feather mattress."
1,Pincushion Mattress Topper,"I want to second the review from ""Not Grandma's Featherbed"". At first I thought it was nice, but not great. But after 3 months use I too experienced the quills poking through the liner and my flannel sheets to stab me in various sensitve parts of my body. Certainly not what I would consider a ""good nights sleep"" and a most unpleasant way to awaken in the middle of the night. I plan on writing the manufacurer and giving them my opinion. This was the biggest waste of $90 I can remember."
1,Can not review something a have not received,"I still have not received my product, how can I review it? Already ask where is it, and did not get an answer"
4,liquid sounds and cheeky cover,"this is truly one of the most unique american shoe-gazer releases from the early '90's. one listen and your ear is glued to each melody. for myself, the nail in the coffin came in the form of their take on madonna's ""angel"", which immediately grabs your ear and hangs on tight. some bunghole i used to know borrowed my copy and never returned it, and i would pay dearly to be able to get my hands on another one (even a taped copy would do)."
1,Safety issue,We purchased the Little tikes Easy Store slide because it appeared to be a nice easy to use slide in the house. However when we proceeded to assemble the slide the rod and caps were not fitting properly. These are critical pieces to the assembly and without proper fit they could cause the slide to collapse. The rod is made from a molded plastic and bends when you try to fit the caps. The caps require considerable force to install and we could not get them to fit even after multiple attempts. Very poor design and a potential safety issue for small children!! Based on other reviews I will check out the Step 2 slide. We have had much better luck with their products in the past. I would not recommend you purchase this slide based on the above issue.
4,VERY hard to assemble,"It took three adults an hour to almost assemble the slide. We still haven't figured out how to get the base connected, and hammering the red caps onto the pole proved impossible. We ended up filing down the ends of the pole and smashing the caps on. They are barely on though, so I am using duct tape over them. Putting the bar through the holes was also quite a challenge. Very frustrating. UPDATE: It is now Oct '05, and we STILL haven't figured out how to get the base on!!!"
3,Too hard to assemble!,"The problem starts with inserting the stairs into the base. Unless you weigh 200 pounds, you can't get it to pop in. The next problem is with inserting the black tube. It's next to impossible. The end caps were also very difficult to put on. I actually took it back to the store to have the help me get it together. This product is no fun for the parents.........."
4,my son loved it,"i thought that it wouldn't be alot of fun because all it was was a slide however,my son thought otherwise.he is 18 months old and his favorite part of the park or anyones jungle gym or play area is the slide.so my husband brought home a little of the park to him!!he absolutely loves it.he shrieks with delight everytime he slides down or even slides his hotwheels down it!!!"
1,Badly manufactured,"I bought this slide because it looked easy to assemble. There was no quality in the way the molded plastic fittings were manufactured. The base and ladder couldn't be assembled because the locking portions didn't match. The plastic rod used in assembly bent and couldn't be made to fit it's connections. It will be returned-shame on Little Tykes, they need quality control!"
5,Wonderful Slide!!,"Just picked up this slide for $59.99 at Toys'r'us. What a great investment. My children will probably get at least 10 years of use out of it!! This slide will be used for a long time because of its durability and size. The first thing I thought of was ""a mammoth"" when I saw the size of this thing fully assembled! The size would definitely be a problem if it was like the older Little Tikes slide that didn't fold up for storage. My children absolutely love it! They can use it in the playroom in the winter and take it outside in the summer."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"Finally, I found it. I've been searching for actual Winter Solstice music to play during the holidays. Not one with Christmas songs, but rather, actual songs about the Winter Solstice: the dark season, the return of the light, and the winter season. This is it! It is perfect! The songs have a wonderful earthy feel to them; they really get you in the mood for enjoying the winter season. The album has lots of songs on it, so you really get your money's worth and the songs have lots of variation and interest to them. There are some spoken words throughout that really help set an overall tone of reverence and enjoyment of the season. I love this CD and it will become an auditory staple in this Humanist/Pagan household every time the wheel turns to the dark time of the year! Thank you so much to the artists for creating such a wonderful work of musical art!"
2,Audio Samples PLease.,I'd be nice if this album had audio samples to listen to before buying.If someone would put them on the page it be appreciated.Thank You.
4,Entertaining Elizabethan Romance,"I ordered this book because of my interest in all things Elizabeth Tudor. She only ended up playing a minor role, but the author does a good job writing an interesting story; I finished it in less than two hours, so it certainly held my attention. The heroine was an admirable one-- strong and interesting-- but I'd say the hero was a bit weak. I was fine with the Cinderella-esque mould, with a likeable heroine trapped with a vindictive stepsister and stepmother. I'd say once Sybil made her big gesture of vengeance, however, the book took a downward turn. I was not so inclined to buy Curran's change of heart."
3,Technosoul sandwich,"This is an oddly arranged album, and I'm confused as to whether it is indeed entirely System 7. It begins and ends with true techno, aged surprisingly well, and in between lies White Room-ish KLF territory. It's something like the pseudosoul pop one might hear on a mild bus route--not that it's altogether unpleasant--just a rather unwelcome contamination of instrumental purity. ""Sunburst"" is the obvious standout here, on a decent album with unusual continuity."
3,A foundation but not the end of research,"This dictionary is a good resource to begin the study of 19th century / Victorian-era England and America. It covers a wide range of historical events, places, material culture and biography, but, despite its mammoth size, it really goes into little detail. Plus, because of the spread of sparse entries, one gets little ""feel"" for the times. Recommended as the start of research and ideas but not the final volume read on the matter."
2,non-practical,"in retro-spect, the knife kit sounds like a great deal, and as a start out chef i thought it would be great, when i revived the case, i immaturely realized that it weighed a ton. the knifes themselves are good quality, but they are oversized and not very practical for full production kitchen use."
1,"""made in china for Slitzer""","knives were dull and flimsy, case was dented & handle was broken. Very poor quality and reminds me of something you would find in a flea market. Slitzer name prominently displayed however the flip side in small print on the knives states ""made in china for Slitzer"""
5,Knives,These knives are just awsome way more then what i expected for 112$ these knives are very well crafted handles are great. Me being a cheff would recommend these for any students and cheffs looking for a good set of knives. Ive bought a 300$ set of knives and these are way better in many ways and i got way more in this set then in my 300$ set. Dont listen to any bad reviews on these knives fast shipping awsome quality. The ones that complain must be use to there cheap walmart brand knives and not a real true knive set. Yes there assembled in china but great german steal all around.
4,"Great hardware and price, AWFUL software","As long as you're able to install it, this is an excellent product. After setting it up, I have an excellent signal eventhough it has to go through two walls.However, I only gave 4 stars (tempted to give it 3, but the price is just too good), because the software installation is a real pain. After trying for 2 hours to set it up via the provided cd's I gave up. Instead I just installed the client driver and set up the router through the browser, this didn't take more than 15 min.Great hardware, but the software installation is impossible (doesn't help that the manual is not printed)"
4,I like them,"Ok, so i am a sucker for cute packaging. I think these look so good in my cleaning collection. For what i use them, they work. I also really like the scent. Yes, they are pricier than other brands but when you buy them in packs like i do (i hate going grocery shopping so i stock up) the price is actually really decent. Considering that they are environmentally friendly, i don't mind paying a little more. I will just keep the cleaning to a minimum... :)"
3,Recognizes the humour of our daily lives...,"There are no jokes or riddles in this ""comedy"" series; only a down to earth recounting of the humorous events that make up the human experience. Younger audiences will not understand or appreciate the grins that the adult listeners find contagious. (ie, finding the heater in an original VW bug; a truly funny tale!) A wholesome and inexpensive stocking stuffer for the over-30 crowd."
5,love citric acid,This works so good when canning and can not beat the price compared to in the stores. I love getting stuff from barry farms can not beat there prices either
1,"citric acid, 4 oz.","Did not come in a sealed package, but in a small ziploc bag. Will not use it...Also, shipping was way expensive in comparison with the value of the product."
3,"Citric Acid, 4 oz didn't pass the taste test.","I bought this item as a replacement for the more.expensive ""Fruit Fresh"" which I use in emulcified juices I make myself.With s/h it wasn't cheaper and didn't do a better job of preserving the juices for storage in the frig. And it had a much more bitter after taste than ""Fruit Fresh"" I still have most of the bottle leftSo I don't think I'll buy this again."
4,"5 stars from my daughter, 3 from me","My 20 month old little girl loves this DVD. It holds her attention & doesn't have anything that makes me worry about her seeing it.To me it falls short of the best Sesame Street DVDs for early watchers. The song writing isn't quite as strong. Too many have Big Bird as their subject matter. The audio on 3-4 songs is sub-par -- distorted from the level being too high or poorly mixed for depth. A surround sound system has to be set to ""music"" instead of ""movie"" or the sound is really flat. The vocals on the country style Wheels on my Feet sound like city-folk playing ya-hoo country. (the great Wavin' Goodbye To You With My Heart on Sing Yourself Silly shows how well the Sesame Street crew can do this style). This reads like harsh treatment, but I think the DVD is a notch below the best or even what they could have done with the chosen songs.[review edited from first version]"
5,I read,"this book thirty years ago when Kung was world wide news for being silenced by the Catholic Church. Tubingen University continued his professorship and Kung continued to write. His book on comparative religions isn't a fast read but it is really thorough. I just finished rereading ""Christian"" and remembered all over why the church would kick his work out. The Catholic Church doesn't want Kung's version of Christianity that does not depend on power and control. Kung provides a humanist view that is hopeful and builds on the work of the second Vatican Council. Pope John the XXIIIrd haunts this book and makes me wistful for what could have been. Kung is a contemporary of the current pope and both worked together at Tubingen and both had doctoral students together. This is revealed in Kung's second autobiography, Disputed Truths...very aptly named."
5,On being a Christian,My second reading of this classic! I never realized how much more I learned from it this time around. A man who could have been pope had he compromised his beliefs.
5,On Being a Christian,"Hans Kung is one of the greatest theogians of the 20th century - always out in front calling the Christian community forward while being deeply rooted in the Christian tradition. Although at times he tends to be ""wordy"", he has the ability to make one excited about being a disciple of Jesus and to belong to the Christian community."
1,The most boring book I have ever read,"I want a T-shirt, ""I survived ON BEING A CHRISTIAN"". This book was so highly rated, I assumed that it was bound to get better, even though it started off as dull as can be. But apart from a few insightful paragraphs on the nature of the Kingdom of God, I was utterly disappointed. I'm not saying the man is a fool, but I am saying this book is not for everybody. If you don't enjoy the first few pages, be warned, it does not get better. And some of the assumptions made will not be appreciated by fundamentalists, conservatives, evangelicals or even moderates (for example, the impossibility of miracles).This book is heavy reading, for those who enjoy liberal academic theology."
5,"Kung above, beyond, and further than Lewis","Where Lewis is obviously easier to read, Kung is obviously better informed, more aware, in closer contact with the world religions, ideaologies, and faiths of the planet. Where Lewis is simple and clear, Kung is complex and multiform like the two thousand year old topic he dissects and explores is. Where Lewis is thoroughly right in his little picture of god and jesus and the church, Kung is deeply commited to dialogue, to learning, to challenging and confronting the orthodox and all the so called ""pious"" theologians and apologetes who are always so ""right""."
5,A challenging book for an atheist such as myself,"Kung writes very well and made me think a great deal. He opened my mind to seeing christianity in ways I hadn't thought of before. I liked this book a great deal-the author comes across as a deeply caring man of great humanity. While I am still an atheist, this book made me stop and think very respectfully about what was written. Convincing? Not quite. Moving? Yes."
4,Christianity on the trial by a Christian,"Kung defends the principles of Christianity throughly andeloquently.Always mindful of the need for comrades in a defenceof faith, he presents the last 100 pages of this book as endnotesfrom noted theologians from Lewis to Luther. Though a catholic, Kung presentsa defense that will challenge believers of all denominations.A note of caution, this is not representive of the more approachablewritings of CS Lewis, it is a difficult read and often Kung'sgreatest insights come in the midst of pages of hard and impersonaltheology."
1,DOESN'T GLOW IN THE DARK BUBBLE BATH,"THIS PRODUCT ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT GLOW IN THE DARK WHEN ADDED TO WATER,DOESNT CREAT ANY BUBBLES OR FOAM ONLY THE BOTTLE GLOWS BUT THAT'S IT. IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY DON'T BUY IT"
2,Do your research on the author,"Surprised to see this fiction author still of interest to someone. Do some research on the author and you'll see this is all fiction. I read The Third Eye when I was in my 20s and thoroughly enjoyed it. Only problem was that I didn't realize it was all fiction, as is this title."
1,Total crap!,"I guess if you're inclined to believe this hogwash you'll buy this book and think it's great stuff. But it isn't. It's just bunk, from a man who's been exposed repeatedly as a charlatan. Save your money and buy something else!"
2,novel idea,what i thought was a novel idea turned out to be pretty cheesy and never got used. just write your own little notes and save yourself the wasted money.
2,It had no plot - a waste of time,I had to read this book for 8th grade summer reading. I couldn't believe what a dumb story it was. It made no sense but was quite funny. Maybe I just don't get it.
4,Great singer!,"My favorite album of her is her fairy one, me and my daughter listen to it all the time. I am just a little dissappointed that some songs on this CD are not child approriate so I cant really play it with my little one like i can with the fairy cd. But we LOVE HER!"
2,not good for fine teas,I just tried to use it for a first time and i ended up just throwing it awaythe item is not closing completely - there is a little gap between the half a lot of tea is getting into my cap.i tried to adjust it and make it closer and was amazed on how cheap metal quality is it - its easily bends but it is not closing this gap. so i can't use it.would not recommend.
2,The one from MV Trading Co is junk,"I'm not sure if all the buying options on this page are actually for the same product or not. I bought the one from the MV Trading Co, and it does not seal well at all. You can see a gap where the edges meet, and my tea leaves are constantly floating around in the water. I have another one that I bought in Germany, looks identical, but actually seals in the tea. This one doesn't. I'm tempted to buy one from the other vendors to see if there is a difference, but I don't really need 3 of these..."
3,Good Deal,"This was a gift to myself for someone who really loves tea. However, if used with smaller chopped tea, it isn't great as the tea can fall out between the lips where it closes. If using larger leaf tea, it was fantastic. Shipped fast and product was in perfect shape. No complaints."
3,Works well at the moment,"Works well at the moment, but the spoon portions that form the ball seem like they will not last for any length of time. They have a flimsy feel with too much wiggle."
5,Neat gadget,"I bought this item to make a single serving of loose leaf (in cup). It works great. The handle is long enough to stir with as well. It's well made, very sturdy. A quality product."
5,does the job,very simple product and it does the job really well. no complaints; i am happy with my purchase.
2,"This is a sturdy infuser, but the ball is just too small","This tea infuser is well made and works as it should, however, the ball is simply too small to make a decent size cup of tea.I recommend the tea infuser by BigKitchen. It's sturdy and the ball is plenty big for a large cup of tea."
5,Very effective alternative to sachets and tea bags,"I bought this tea infuser because my wife and I love Harneys tea and like to use the loose tea because it is more cost effective. We had been using an infuser that is ""spoon"" shaped. The spoon shaped infuser worked very poorly because the water could not effectively get to the tea. This infuser works excellent. The mesh is about the size of a golf ball and is very effective at allowing the water to freely travel to the tea. It also seals very tight which prevents any tea from falling into the water. The only drawback is that the infuser needs to be rinsed out right after it is used because if the tea is allowed to dry in the ball then the mesh is harder to clean. This is not a problem as long as you remember to rinse out the infuser before the tea has dried."
1,Waste of money,"I ordered two of these and one of them broke with the first use. I contacted the seller through Amazon and they never contacted me. Bad, flimsy product and no customer support. Don't waste your money."
1,Broke after a week,"After using it for about a week, it broke and one of the pieces fell off. I had been concerned when I ordered it, based upon other reviews, and saw that it was indeed kind of flimsy feeling when I received it. Still, I figured for three bucks I'd take a chance. #fail"
1,Bad seal,"It does not seal well at all. You can see a gap where the edges meet, and my tea leaves are constantly floating around in the water. Only large leaf loose tea works well with it."
1,poorly made !!,"This tea infuser is very poorly constructed-not only is it extremely difficult to open, but it does not close completely, allowing small tea leaves to escape into the water for the tea."
2,"Cheap, loses tea leaves","This is a nice concept, but not executed very well. It does not seal properly, and allows tea leaves to escape virtually every time. Spend an extra dollar and get this model:Norpro Grip-EZ Tea Infuser with Cup"
3,"Works, but has drawbacks","This is an alright product that does what it is supposed to do, however I find it to be hard to clean since it doesn't open all the way (it opens like an alligator mouth). The bigger thing that I don't like is that the rims of the baskets don't align perfectly, so quite a bit of tea leaks out into the water around it. (I usually use mine with Matte, so perhaps this isn't as much of an issue with other teas.)"
3,Not bad... tends to leak tea leaves.,"All things considered, i'd buy this again.Pro: Inexpensive..Seems durable enough.Easy cleanup.Con: tends to leak tea leaves."
1,trash pop,"This is one of two albums from Stephanie, Princess of Monaco. She had a hit with ""Irresistible"" in the 80s in Europe, but also had plenty press simply for being a Princess. Her voice is rather weak and you can hear it is doubled several times. The production seems weak and trashy too. It's for lovers of trash pop and famous people starting to sing only."
2,Cake very dry.,"We ordered the Chocolate Lover's Cake for a special occasion. It looked good, the frosting was good, but the cake was very dry. All the frosting in the world can't cover up a dry cake. Very disappointed especially when promised a moist cake."
1,Not pleased with the chocolate cake,"Sorry I have to say that although I've enjoyed many foods from Omaha Steaks, this chocolate lovers cake was not one of them. The cake was extremely dry and the frosting was very bitter. A friend and I were disappointed upon trying to eat it and threw most of it away."
1,Much cheaper from other sellers..,"Shin ramen is delicious, but this is sooo expensive for a 20 pack. Guys there are much cheaper sellers right here on amazon (<1.00 ea). Look around!"
4,Hot Red Water and Fried Noodles,"I'm eating healthier so I don't keep these in the house at all. Stocking this as an emergency ration is useless because if it is on the premises, then it is not going to last more than a month. It's instant so it's deep fried. It contains palm oil so it is bad for you. It is Korean calibre spicey and to many people all over the world, it is the bomb. Hoo, boy. Raise your children with strong eating standards and deep noodle eating experiences otherwise it is easy to fall down the rabbit hole of a Nong Shim diet and never come out again."
2,The Leap,I enjoy Jonathan Stroud books for the most part but this one was very disappointing. Losing a friend is very hard but the way this one was written didn't do anything except confuse the reader.It was like he couldn't decide which way to go with this one. It just ended without any real explanation of what really happened to Charlie.It had some strange characters in it and nothing was ever explained to the reader. A child would have a difficult time following the storyline and it is a young adult novel.I will continue to read Jonathan stroud's novels but this one really wasn't that good.
3,"Not Bart, but still a good read","This is another fine book by Johnathan Stroud. If you're a fan of Bartimaeus, don't expect to find that kind of wit and humor here. This is a much darker story, and in many ways I found it very sad. The themes revolved around death, and loss, and loneliness, all with a nice supernatural twist. As a fan of Bartimaeus myself, I was a little sad not to see more of something like him, but I suppose it can't always be Bartimaeus all of the time, and in the end it is a good story.I did enjoy The Leap more than Heroes of the Valley, but that may just be personal taste."
2,Rough Start,"In the first part of this book I did not really like it as it seemed rather boring. Although it gets off to a slow start it is a pretty decent book. I enjoyed the ending, but this book is probably not one of my favorites. I wouldn't reccomend it unless you have nothing better to read."
2,Great Movies Second Rate Sales Gimmick,"Both of these movies are great, fun and classics. I have no problem with either. They still hold up as good movies. I agree with the other reviewer who made comments about the packaging and the 'double feature' sales gimmick. It is a good idea. Two great old movies back to back for a modest price. When I saw the Turner Classic opening for Dirty Dozen I thought, ""what did they do? Just copy this off of TV?""The movies rock? The double feature concept is cool. Just wish they would have put a little more into it and gave us something extra like a 'making of' or maybe some new interviews."
3,Misleading product details.,"Don't be mislead. This is a one-disc, side a, side b, double feature. The product details are wrong. I love the movies. They are both full of action and have their own brand of humor. I will keep the disc despite expecting one thing (a two disc set) and getting another."
5,Kelly's Heroes/The Dirty Dozen,Both movies take place during WW II. The story lines are as completely different as are the stars of the movies. Clint Eastwood (Kelly) is looking for German gold in Kelly's Heroes. Lee Marvin is looking to stay alive while training a dozen condemned prisoners. Both films are well done and worth the watch. Neither are for children.
3,Richard's thoughts,I liked these movies when I saw them on TV. I still enjoy them. Thank you for your prompt delivery.
3,Entertaining,Both films are just entertaining -- not classics.It's good to see the old actors in their primes (and still alive).
3,Wish I could rate by story...,"Ok, the first two stories are horrible..., but this is worth getting just for Kresley Cole's first introduction to her Immortals After Dark series. That story and the whole series is addictive! I'm already freaking out waiting for the next book!Anyway, the first two stories are just bad. I even tried to read more Kenyon (Dark-Hunter Series) and I just can't get into her writing. I just could care less about her characters. As for the Viking story...I don't even know where to begin. Suffice it to say, I'm not interested in even trying out more Jaid Black writing.At any rate, Kresley Cole's story is so good, it's worth it to buy this whole book."
3,Feel Ripped Off,I was disappointed in the price of this book for what was given. The first two books barely had enough to be called a short story. Did enjoy the third book by Kresley Cole.
3,A Teaser,"I don't know what I was expecting. Overall,it was an okay read. Nothing that I would read twice, but enough for me to want to see what other books these authors have to offer. For me, I felt like the stories were teasers. I would recommend reading if you've never read anything by the authors."
4,Loved it.,"I only read The Warlord Wants Forever by Kresley Cole. I will go back and read the others after I am done with her series. I really liked this book. The story of Myst and Wroth was very engaging. This series wasn't as detailed as others in detailing the different immortals, but I liked that. I also appreciated how both sides, male and female were told. I'm not ever sure what the main immortal is, if there is one? I look forward into a full book and really getting into this series."
3,Playing Easy To Get,"I enjoyed Kresley Cole's story in this book, it was a story I wanted to read. The other two authors are fine but I didn't feel compelled to read those since their other work was more interesting to me. It was worth it for Cole's story."
3,overall not worth it,"I bought this book for the Kresley Cole novella, and that one novella doesn't disappoint as it sets up the beginning of the Immortals after Dark series. But, the other two stories were just not as polished or interesting as the Cole offering and the price is high for only one good story. The Sherilyn Kenyon offering was disjointed with cardboard characters who change their tune midstream. The Jaid offering could have been fun, but needed more space to tell the story or to involve the reader.This is not a book you ""must have"" in your personal library - there's really no reason to pick it up and re-read it later on."
4,playing easy to get,"I bought this book for the story of Kresley Cole's ""The Warlord wants Forever"". This is from her ""Immortals after dark series"" and tells the story of Nikolai Wroth and Myst the Coveted. As with all of the books in this series I absolutely loved this story. I highly recommend reading all of the Immortals after Dark books."
4,Must like SEX!!!,"If you like your books, and characters, hot, erotic and sexy - then this is the book for you! You will find that you actually become involved with, and develop feelings for, the characters in this book of three separate stories. Each character has problems seemingly impossible to resolve until they meet someone who rocks their world! The sex is very explicit. But the people are endearing, sometimes maddening and sometimes comical. It's a fun book but not one that really stays with you long after you've read it. The characters and stories, while likeable, are easily forgotten once you've finished. But, like I said, very sexy!"
3,OK intro to Usually Great Authors,"Kenyon: BAD series is good, this is OK intro to it.Black: OK intro to series.Cole: Fans of the series always wanted to get the Wroth and Myst story since it is referred to so mush in other books. Good Story."
5,Kresley Cole Book,"The book I got is in great condition and although I just started reading it, it is hilarious and makes you never want to put it down. I've read most of Kresley Cole's books and this one is a perfect start to the rest of the series that I love so much. It is hilarious and intriguing and she really has a way of bringing her characters to life."
1,Pass This One Over and Move On!,If you're thinking about trying this book out...think again!! I would not recommend this book as it has no plot and the story and the romance are weak. None of the stories kept my attention or interest.This is one that I would walk on by and not look back. Keep looking as there are better ones to spend your money on.
1,Not Free SF Reader,"Well, this is pretty much porn, and not very good at that. The almost complete absence of plot, etc. The Warlord story has valkyries who are supposed to kill vampires, etc.So, the first thing the captured valkyrie does for him is a striptease. All parties are quite braindead here it seems, hormones overactive, even for immortals where that is not supposed to be a factor."
3,1 out of 3 isn't too bad,"I didn't get into the first story at all. Too short, no depth to the characters. The second story was ok, but also too short and could have been a full novel itself if they really wanted to explain this ""world"" that was created for it. I loved the last story, but I have been reading Kresley Cole's immortals after dark series, when I found out this was where her first story in this world began. So i had some background on this story and could go into it as kind-of a prequel to the others. So it didn't require all the details that were missing from the other two stories. All in all glad I got it."
4,Great for the Kresley Cole story only!!,"Sharilynn Kenyon gets top billing in this but her story was lame!! Not at all sexy and not at all believable.The Jaid Black story is unusual (a modern woman kidnapped and sold to the hot Viking leader of some underworld civilization) but it is sexy and well done. I liked the characters so it was easy to get into the fantasy part.The Kresley Cole story is about Myst the Valkyrie and the vampire Wroth. If you have read Cole's Immortals After Dark series of books, you are familiar with them. I loved reading about how they meet and get together. It's very good, very sexy and truly the best reason to buy this book."
5,Kenyon Never Disappoints,Any book written by Sherrilyn Kenyon is worth the read. She has a style of writing that grabs your attention from the beginning and weaves needed details in as the story line develops.
3,Good Patches,"For cleaning, these are a little small, but I use them in several different ways and go through a bunch. I am not sorry I bought these and will buy them again."
3,Too big for 9mm,"These patches seem to be good quality but I wouldn't call them ""All Caliber Cleaning Patches"". They are too big for a 9mm without cutting them down. I cut them into squares and they work fine. But it's kind of inconvenient to do so. As far as quality goes I would give them five stars but I can only give three stars because I have to cut them down."
3,ooppss! Should have read a little more about the product,"I thought I was just buying some gun barrel cleaning patches. Didn't realize it was a component of an entire cleaning system, so I can't use the product as intended. But, I can use them for wiping down small parts, etc. As I re-read the product description, I see it vaguely indicates this is a component for use with other tools. Disapointed, but not totally unhappy."
3,Otis Spare Patches,Purchased for Otis Cleaning system as extrasHave not used the patches yetI would recommend this item for consumers
4,"I like the idea, but...","I like the idea of these patches, but I find that they are a bit too small for my 45, even using the largest diameter fold. They are great for my 9mm and the Otis system, in general, can't be beat for doing a quick swab while the barrel is still warm. I find it makes the cleaning process much easier, even without the tightest fit on larger calibers. So I continue to use them, but a 3 inch patch would be perfect."
3,Bit misleading,"I bought these because they claim to be ""All Caliber"" but that is a bit misleading on the part of Otis as the canister they come in clearly say .25-.50 caliber. Thankfully I have a 30-06 that these work on as well and will hold up to the 6 uses claim if used with it.My .22 savage 64fxp though will not take these without cutting them up and after cutting will not hold up to the 6 uses claim without almost destroying the patch, you might be able to get away with using the patch 3 times on 1 side but that might be stretching it. I'd recommend buying these in conjunction with their small caliber patches as well."
2,Overpriced standard patches with holes poked in them,After receiving these I see that they are nothing more than regular old cleaning patches (that can be purchased for much less) with small holes cut in them. Save your money and poke your own holes.
5,Otis all caliber cleaning patches,Seem expensive until you realize they can be used 6 times per patch and will clean from 22 cal to 45 cal.
5,"These work really well, not 6X but 4X","Otis advertises these as good for 6 passes. I've never gotten that but I do get 4 good passes with one of the Otis flexible rods. The complete system is great for cleaning from breech to muzzle, the preferred way to clean your firearm. These also allow you to clean a variety of different caliber firearms so you don't need to buy several sizes of cleaning patches."
3,Not what I expected,"If you are looking for a clipper that cuts really close, this is not the one for you"
3,Nice puzzle but not for the youngest,"This puzzle is the normal (well made) Lauri construction. Most of the puzzles are great for young children, but some (this being one of them) have pieces that appear to be symmetrical - but are not. It's difficult for the youngest of the age groups to put such pieces into the puzzle.If the non-symmetrical pieces have few projections (like petals) that are non-symmetrical, the puzzles are fine. However, for circular objects (like flowers) with many petals, it's tough for very young children to put those pieces into the puzzle. Other than artistic license, there was no need for the designer to create such pieces."
5,Blueair 501,"Eliminates odors from cooking, smoking, even painting!For smokers, do use special Smoke Stop filters and keep it on high setting."
5,"Great, as expected",Every book I have read by Raymond Brown is great. Brown was an excellent scholar who wrote high quality explanations on many Christian topics. This book is in line with his other accomplishments.
1,Beware of defects,"I ordered this lens for my wife to use with her Sony Alpha. It arrived as promised, packaged well, but upon inspection there was a visible defect on the interior of the lens glass. No amount of cleaning could get rid of it. No problem - I sent for a replacement. Because of Amazon's return process it was easy to send the first one back and order another (the only reason I gave it one star). The second one was on our doorstep within four days. Again, package intact, but a very similiar situation with the second one except this ""smudge"" on the inside was longer - almost all the way across the lens. I also returned the second lens and got a full refund with no problems. I bought the Tamron based on the reviews, but there are obviously some quality control issues. I'm looking at the Sony or Sigma badged lenses now."
3,Good for the price,"This is a good lens, great value for the money. The zooming is not as smooth as my old lens for the Nikon film camera..."
3,worked as expected,"for the price I paid, i am happy for the shots I took and its operation.my only complaint is that the aperture got stuck after 5 years of use. don't know if it's ITS TIME but I wished it lives on given my low usage."
4,"Great for price, but ...","This is a great lens, and is worth what I paid, which is remarkably not a lot for a lens. But there are signs that tell you why its quite inexpensive:-The Autofocus is incredibly slow-Its hard to fumble around with all of the switches for the auto focus/manual focus and normal/macro-hood only goes in one direction (nikon's hoods can be pointed out or in for storage)A few tips for using this lens:-Don't skimp on a filter, when you use a cheap one, its a lot easier to tell.-Be careful when trying to use the switches fast, and always make sure you are out of the macro range of focus when you are trying to zoom out to lower than 180, and you want to quick click it down.But overall its a nice lens, and if you need a big zoom for a low cost, this is a fine choice."
3,Tamron 70-300,I purchased this lens as a macro zoom I would not sugest using it for microstock purposes it does have a tendency to leave an aura around the shot when viewed at 100% Otherwise it is a great lens for the money. If you are looking for a lens to add to your kit for everyday purposes it's a great deal.
5,Oldie but goodie . . .,"I'd forgotten I had this lens until a couple of weeks ago. It was in a bottom compartment of my camera bag. I pulled it out one night having forgotten what it was, realized I hadn't shot with it in several years, slapped it on my 40D and haven't had it off since (three weeks, now)!I love this lens. I've had none of the problems mentioned in the negative reviews, except occasional slight CA in some shots. Consistently sharp -- even at 300mm. Even hand-held! Terrific depth of field control and bokeh. Solid color rendering. Beautiful ""macro"" (actually, near-macro) effects.Sure, I've got ""better"" more expensive lenses. But for one piece of general all-purpose daily walk-around glass that's ready for virtually ANY situation from insect to human portrait to telephoto action and wildlife and landscape shots -- at this remarkable price point -- this lens can't be beat without paying twice (or far more) as much."
4,Great Lens,"I've only had this lens for a few weeks now, but Wow. Definitely worth it if you are on a tight budget."
2,Not a great lens..at least the one I got.,"This lens will not focus at any range beyond about 100mm. Try to focus...and it wont, either manually or autofocus. Built cheaply as well. Should have known better. First time I have ever bought a cheap lens. As they say...you get what you pay for. Well, this one I really did get what I paid for. I cannot recommend this to anyone. And yes...I have used Canon EOS cameras and lenses for 25 years or so. I had one of their first EOS-1 film cameras. And more since. So I do have plenty of experience with cameras and lenses of this type."
5,Great Lens,"Now I'm an amateur photographer, so I don't know much about lenses and everything, but I can tell what a good picture looks like, and this, for us, has taken many great pictures. Even fully zoomed in, pictures come out wonderful. Compared to the price for the Canon lens, this is quite a bit cheaper, but not cheap at all. We were actually surprised how heavy this lens is, especially compared to the kit lens that came with the Canon Rebel XT we purchased. I'd highly recommend this for those wanting longer distance, but also wanting to save some money."
5,Great telephoto lens for the money,"I have used this telephoto lens with filters, with teleconverters and it works seamlessly with my Sony SLR. No problems noted. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to supplement their kit lens. It also definitely makes a difference that the stabilization for the Sony is on the body of the camera and not dependent on the lens like Canon or Nikon."
3,Great for the price.,"For the price, this a pretty good lens. You have to have steady hands in order to catch fast moving objects (like motorcycles). At full zoom, I think the pictures aren't extremely sharp but still passable.The picture of the green motorcycle racer is one of the pics I submitted.I use this lens when I need more reach than the kit lens but don't necessarily want to pull out the big 500mm Sigma."
5,affordable accessory lens,"Granted, you get what you pay for - I think this lens does it's job. For folks on a budget who want to shoot like the pros, this lens is great. I shoot macro shots in my own yard. Good for wildlife too. You might still need a tripod for some of those tricky shots though.And as always - read the instructions!"
4,The price gives it the 4th star!,"I own an Alpha-200 and have 2 other lens for it (Sony/Sigma) and this is just as reliable as the others... The only complaint I have is the zoom is a little stiff. I recently went to the Great Wall and the 300mm really got to shine! Overall it's a sturdy 3, but the price makes it a 4, as it was very inexpensive."
5,Can't beat it for the price and quality,I was reluctant at first to buy this lens. I read several reviews first and felt comfortable investing in it. The first pictue i took was a confirmation that I made the right decision. I do suggest reading the instructions before using and they are easily understood. Plus! This lens comes with a 6 year warranty. now that in itself got my vote.You won't regret butying this lens.
3,Save Up. Buy Better.,"I bought this lens at the same time as my first DSLR, Canon XSi, before I really knew what I was looking at. For the price, the image quality is decent. Other than that, I would look elsewhere - and in fact I am at the moment.Pros:- Inexpensive- Cheap way to get into macro- Decent quality pics, more so on the macro side- Loooong zoom rangeCons:- Cheap-feeling construction- Awkward controls for switching to/from macro mode- Noisy and SLOW- Not good in low light because of max aperatures- AI is not great, but usually manually focus when shooting macroBottom Line:- If you only have $175 to spend on a zoom tele/macro, it's not a bad deal. If you're hoping to get great action shots or nice bokeh, you're probably gonna have to triple your budget and look at Sigma or Canon.For me, I'm selling it and getting the Sigma 70-200mm and a tele converter."
1,JUNK,"So this lens after having it for about a week i noticed dust in my photos, so i cleaned the lens and still dust in my photos. AS is turns out there was dust between the front two elements of the lens. now i do not go into any harsh enviornments to take photos and always take care of my equipment, this should not happen, I emailed the Tamron service center and they told me that it was not covered under warranty, B.S. I say. But any way the photos are soft at all focal lengths. Bottom line spend a little more and do not buy this piece of crap"
1,fail,i buy this lens but stop focusing after light use i was shooting at one my girls high school event so after a pause taking photos this lens just stop working for not reason
2,Tamron AF 70-300mm F/4-5.6 Zoom,I returned this lens. I was not happy with the quality of the photos thatI took using this lens.
2,Not worth the trouble,"I purchased this lens based on a few reviews. Generally I don't listen to what everyone has to say... I should have. This lens is not even close to Nikon quality...Duh! Still for $200 I thought it would fit my budget and photography skill. It is noisy and it takes longer to adjust with the auto focus on. I think I should have practiced more on some ""not so important"" shots first before relying on it for a special event. The lens adapter shown on the advertisement was junk. Very misleading. Now I'm stuck with a lens that's noisy and generally stays out of focus for even slow moving shots. I suppose that is why lens cost $500+ for quality and a piece of mind. I already have a 200mm but thought this might get me a little closer to the action. It only got me closer to an empty wallet."
2,Sticky and Soft,Bought this for my son as a backup to his Sony 75-300 that has become difficult to zoom because of a dirty environment. He uses it for rodeo photography with his old Alpha 100. Has been a good business for 5 years but dirt is a problem and most shops don't want to clean a Sony lens. The Sony is still working fine but is harder to zoom because of built up dust.Thought we would take a chance on this lens and just replace it every couple of years because of the dust. Reviews looked OK but the Tamron lens doesn't work for us.Compared even to the (used gummy) Sony lens it was sticky and especially hard to zoom near the 300mm range. This may be OK for still nature shots but it kills fast moving sports action shots when you have to make the camera twitch to zoom in. Also compared to the modest Sony 70-300 the Tamron 70-300 was noticeably softer in the same shooting conditions. I would gauge it at about 30% softer.We returned it. Wish it would have been more serviceable.
3,Best lens in cheaper price,I used this lens since last year with my Nikon. Image result is really aswsome. Auto Focus is bit slow...but OK. As its a non VC lens...bit difficult to take snaps in low light without Tripod or Remote...Overall 7/10
5,"Excellent, especially if on a budget","If your on somewhat of a budget but want a telephoto then get this lens. AF is sometimes a little slow but that's OK. Actual quality of my shots - excellent. You will be happy when you get this, slap it on and realize you only paid $160. Telephoto is really good and macro is great!"
4,First dedicated macro lens,"I purchased this lens in Used-like new condition. It arrived on time and in excellent condition. It is the first time I have had a dedicated macro lens. My Tamron 28-300mm lens was listed as a Macro and I liked it very much, but this lens has a setting that changes it from ""Normal"" to ""Macro"" with the flip of the switch. I muct say that the background bokeh is excellent in Macro. I have shot mostly flowers in Macro and I am impressed with the color, clarity and DOF I'm seeing. It has taken some getting used to to get the lens to revert from Macro back to Normal for storage purposes. The Macro setting has to be lowered to 180mm and the zoom has to be retracted, but then the switch operates quite nicely. Just takes some getting used to. So far I really like this lens for the Macro settings I purchased it to provide. I have shot it primarily hand-held and I'm sure this summer when my roses bloom I'll shoot it from the tripod as well. So far so good!"
4,Good lens for the price:),Lens is well constructed and very pleasing to the eye.shoots relatively good photos and is easy to use..auto focus motor is rather noisy but tolerable..a bit heavy but not too over weight..for the money this is a great lens..Especially for entry level photographers ..
4,nice lens for the price,"a nice lens for the price. however, image is not very sharp at zoom. This is expected I guess for the price range. Focusing is pretty fast too."
3,Not too bad,I rec'd this lens by mistake (ordered the newer 70-300mm version and they sent me this one). Seemed to work ok. But when you zoom in to 300mm the stability of the image is not great. Also not great under darker conditions. Probably would have kept it but just didn't feel right about getting the wrong product.
3,Tamron AF 70-300,For a cheap lens the quality of pictures is not bad. This is a great startr lens for the price.
2,cheap zoom lens,"This was my first zoom lens for my canon 20d. It's alright for shooting still shots, but certainly not any moving ones. The lens focuses VERY slowly and often has trouble detecting contrast. It gets totally lost and then the only way to recover it is by fixing it on manual focus. I have used the canon equivalent and had a much better experience with that one. I would not buy this lens if you are planning to be a professional photographer. It isn't reliable enough."
3,Good for the bucks,"For the money this is a nice lens. It takes good pictures. However, I was a little dissappointed in the movement of the lens. When rotating for focas or to zoom adjustments, the action is slow, tight, and deliberate. Also, I need to take some more pictures. Because what I am seeing in the lens finder does not seem to be as clear and focused on the final picture itself. It is nice to have the six year warranty. I am probably going to keep the lens, but I have to amit, I was hoping for something a bit better. Maybe I should have stuck with a Canon lens."
2,Awful chromatic abberation,"As they say, you get what you pay for. This is true for lenses. The chromatic abberation on this lens is very bad, to the point where it ruins the shot, as it is very difficult to remove even with Photoshop/Lightroom. There is chromatic abberation throughout the range and view, even in the very middle. I know it is a cheap lens, but this one aspect of it makes it not worth it for me at least. The sharpness is about average. Focus is loud and slow. The construction quality is very cheap. Even though there is very little, if any, barrel creep (lens extending under its own weight), as it is very light, the barrel is very choppy - it does not rotate smoothly. The switches have a very tacky and cheap feeling. I would recommend pitching in more and avoiding this lens, or getting a legacy Minolta on eBay."
3,Good on the go,"I got this lens from a friend who called me telling there's a store having a clearance sale and he told me this lens had 90% discount so without any hesitation I asked him to buy it for me (cost 7KD = $23.5 USD). As soon as I tried it on my Sony A100 (Now A700) I knew this lens is not as good as the other lenses but it could handle its job nicely. It lacks quality, its Macro switch always getting on the way of the zoom rotation, has the tendency to slightly go out of focus even with spot focus and also a very slow focus. Picture quality is not as good either but it's good if you're not going big scale. High chromatic aberration on low apertures and hard/sharp DOF which makes the pictures less appealing and need more editing. You don't need to bother if you're going to scale down pictures, you'll be on the safe side."
5,"Great bargin, great lens.","Couldn't resist the price. I have no regrets about buying this. That being said, it is a great lens for someone with a steady hand. I think that the next lens I buy, I will opt for the VC and USM. Just a personal preference. But I still love this lens."
5,Quality lens at a great price,"I bought this to accompany my Pentax K 100D digital camera. While driving throught Kentucky and Ohio, my wife used it to take litterally hundreds of photos of distant trees, barns, horses... I've enjoyed the macro mode as well as the ability to frame sharp images at a distance.The one minor quible is that the infinte focal length setting seems to actually be a little loose - I usually have to back it off a hair when manually focussing. It comes with a hood not shown in the product image which is great for low angle lighting.The overall quality of the lens combined with the price makes this a terrific purchase for amature and hobbyist photographers looking for some fun with a longer angle lens."
1,Cheap for a REASON,"I bought this lens as a hobby piece for when I am at football games or just casually shooting (I have a Canon 40d). After less than a month, the auto focus began grinding, and eventually stopped working completely. I returned it and got another..... BAD DECISION! Same problem in only a couple of weeks. In my opinion, if you want a casual telephoto photography, or just want to break away from your 18-55, go with the canon 55-250 IS. I have it now and it is a much Sharper, and better built lens. I hope this helps you."
2,Keep looking,"The lens has absolutely terrible purple fringing, the worst I've ever seen. Fairly soft focus as well. For the price it isn't bad I suppose, but I'd look at other offerings such as the Sigma...I have no experience with the Sigma but am tempted to order it and sell this one. This lens is usable, it does focus with a D40 and is very inexpensive, but not sharp enough for me nor can I accept the purple fringing."
4,Good lens for the price,I found this to be a very good lens for the amount of money I paid. I love taking pictures at the air shows where I live and wanted a zoom lens for my Canon xti. I didn't have any trouble at all with the auto focus being too slow. (like the other reviewer stated he had) It was easy to use and I got some great images!!! Lots and lots of aviation pics!
2,Less than O.K.,"This is a well built lens with less than ideal performance. From time to time it will surprise you with an acceptible picture (close to very good) but never great. With bright light, a tripod and a frozen bird you may get a great picture. I will continue to use and study this lens but it will not be my primary 300mm telephoto. The Canon IS 300mm will be in my bag. It's o.k. to use this lens to learn camera and lens technique and develope good photography habits. But if you can afford the Canon 70mm-300mm with IS get that instead.Update: After using this lens for several months now, I would like adjust my previous rating of this lens. Perhaps I have developed better lens and camera habits and techniques..... you think. My pictures quality has drasticly improved with this lens. If this lens had IS or VC I would rate a 5 star. As it, I'll go with 4 stars."
2,cheap starter lens,This is a fairly cheap but usable lens. Autofocus is slow but price is explaining everything. For digital SLR I would recommend Tamron's AF 28-300 f/3.5-6.3 XR Di VC. Twice as expensive but a very nice lens. To date I snapped around 1K pictures and I am very satisfied with it. VC stands for vibration compensation and it truly works.
2,Inadequate quality,Very cheap lens and it shows. Feels cheap in hand. The picture quality was abysmal even to my newbie eyes. The images were washed out and very lacking in sharpness. I bought this lens based on some general reviews but my experience was not good. I returned the lens after trying it for a week.
3,Slow to Focus,"Although this lens has nice zoom features, it is slow to focus on a subject in either AF or Manual modes. Hard to get pictures off quickly. For the money, it is a relatively good value."
1,Not good:(,"I read all the other reviews on here and jumped to buy this lens. It seemed perfect for the price and since I am only an amateur I didn't need anything fancy. Well, the lens is no good! The focus in low light is non existent. Even in the shade I couldn't get a photo. It's incredibly noisy and I couldn't even switch into Macro mode. It was stuck! So, don't bother spending your money on this lens if you plan on taking good photos!!"
1,doesn't adapt to sony nex 3,I bought this to adapt onto my sony nex 3 said it would but the camera sony nex 3 doesn't recognize the lense so I can't use it so I need to send it back. Very dissapointing.
1,"Amazon- Mistake, mistake","I bought the Tamaron AF 70-300mm Macro Zoom Lens for Pentax. My item arrived from Amazon after 8 days (too long in my opinion). Finally, I opened it and thought the lens attachment looked rather large. While trying to insert it into my Pentax camera, I saw the mount was WAY too large. I checked the box and a sticker (that Amazon put on) was for the item I needed, but the lens cap (installed by the manufacturer) says ""for Cannon"". I'm sure that all the boxes look similar, but can't they get the right sticker on the right box???? I called and they said I would receive a replacement the next day. It's the end of the next day and the website says ""Shipping Soon"". Save yourself some time and buy locally!!!!!!"
3,Good...but not great,These things would have been nice but even without I'm still fairly happy with this lens and you'll have a hard time beating the price.Likes:+ Includes hood+ 2:1 macro mode+ 70-300mm is a lotta zoom+ Makes your camera look pretty cool+ $150Dislikes:- No VR (Vibration Reduction) as advertised in description- No USM. The focus is sorta slow and loud.- Blue/purple fringe (when viewing @ 100%)- Not so sharp below f7.0- Not constant aperture- Front rotates when focusing and zooming
4,Excellent lens for the price!,"I've owned this lens for a few months now, and love it. While the macro setting is not a true 1:1, it still provides excellent macro detail at a very nice price. Not the best lens for high speed, action shots given it's slow auto focus motor and small aperture. For other applications - still life, portraits, macro, etc. - it's a good choice for those on a budget (like me)."
5,Tamron AF 70-300mm f/4.0-5.6 Di LD Macro Zoom Lens,"Although I have only had a chance to use this lens a couple of times due to the cold weather moving in early in my neck 'o the woods, I can say I am glad I did buy the lens. It is just what I was looking for, the images were great, and it was fun to use. I can recommend it to anyone who wants to save money on a lens with this capability."
2,Not impressed - sent it back,"I was excited to purchase this lens because of the decent reviews and a great price. However, the motor is slow and noisy. I couldn't even get the lens to focus on my subject many times. The lens does not do macro shots as claimed. I was very dissatisfied and I have sent the lens back. I will stick to Canon brand lenses from now on."
4,Good lens for the price,So far I've liked it. Been highly useful at sporting events. Taking wildlife with the macro has been great. My only complaint is it's a little stiff when rotating to zoom or zoom out. Overall I'm satisfied for the price I got it for.
4,Not too bad,"I got this lens for my Nikon D40 and it takes some good shots and some not so good shots, but that is true for a lot of lenses if you don't have a steady hand. But, if you keep a steady hand, you will get good results with this lens. I do have some nice shots of birds and landscapes.It all depends on the settings used and the lighting. I've noticed, latley, the lens is acting slow on focusing. I thought mayabe the battery on my D40 was low, but it was indicating full. But, I like the lens enough to use it for my wildlife shots and landscapes. It is great for a budget, like mine. If you are thinking of ordering one, make sure the place you buy from will return it with no problems first incase you don't like it."
3,not bad for the money,"Had read some good things in dpreview (and at least one other digital camera forum) about this lens. It gives my K100D a nice ""reach"" (up to about 450mm equivalent focal length) and adds a decent macro magnification above 180 mm (270 mm equivalent)... however, it's affordable for a reason: not very sharp at any focal length, adds some color cast to images, has a rotating front lens element and requires some manipulation to get it into and out of macro shooting. Haven't noticed much of a CA problem yet and the contrast is generally good. I've taken a few nice bird photos and people (unposed portraits) shots with this lens; but ususally needs some post-processing (Photoshop Elements) to sharpen up and remove color cast. [But that's true of most of my digital photography, regardless of lens used.] On balance, not a bad compromise for shooters on a budget. I'd like to save up for the Sigma 50-500mm (aka ""Bigma"") lens. Happy shooting!"
4,Pretty good for the price,"I've ad my lens for a week now, you can easily pay twice as much for an equivalent lens. Having said that, I'll just add that is takes pretty decent pictures, combines seamlessly with my Pentax SLR autofocus, the only slight problem I encountered is that the zoom is kind of hard to move, with use I feel it getting more maneuverable."
4,Decent lens,"Works best in abundant light, otherwise it hunts in auto-focus mode. For the price, can't complain too much about that. Images are good."
5,very nice,this lens is more than i expected. the pictures come out very clear and its easy to handle without a tripod.
5,Great lense...,"My Pentax did not have an AF motor, so it was a blessing to find this lense. Works great and does everything that I wanted."
4,Wonderful light-weight zoom & great value,"I picked up this lens a few years ago when I went digital and switched from Minolta SLRs to Canon. For the price, and for a nice outdoor/daylight lens, it's hard to beat. If you expect to take low-light photos with this hand-held, you will be disappointed. But I needed a lightweight lens to be carried around outdoors, and I don't really have to worry all that much about dinging it up. It's tack sharp, holding up to some of my more expensive Canon glass. I can even hand-hold it at 300mm at 1/100 sec without much worry (better at 1/250), and my upper-body strength is probably average for a female photographer.As I said, if you're looking for a low-light lens, this is not it. It is slowish, but especially in low-light. The macro option is nice, but the switch can be hard to turn on and off without taking it off my camera."
5,Good value,"Although it doesn't have VR or VC, it still produces pretty good imagine and functions well. For the price, it's a pretty good deal."
4,"For the price, not a bad lens","This lens is not all bad when you think about the cost. Not an indoor use kind of lens, but outdoors works well. My drawbacks on this lens are mainly the lack of VR (vibration reduction), which would be very helpful when using this on the long end and with macro shots. When using this outdoors at fast shutter speeds and good lighting, it creates some very sharp images, with really nice creamy bokeh, although a bit brightly exposed. Most of my shots with this particular lens end up needing some exposure and color tweaking post production (I always shoot in RAW, though, so it's never a huge issue).I will add that I have used this indoors, in macro mode, using a speedlite and those shots end up very nice, but it makes for some very heavy gear.Overall for the cost, getting a nice macro lens and a nice outdoor portrait lens with nice bokeh, it's a very nice lens for the beginning photographer."
5,"For the price, this is a 5-star lens!!!","From 70-200mm, my sample of the Tamron 70-300mm Di zoom lens is markedly sharper than a Nikon 55-200mm VR lens that I owned and then sold, based on comparisons done with a 10 MP Nikon D60 DSLR camera. Indeed, from 70-200mm, the Tamron lens is quite sharp, period. It's clearly softer at 300mm, based on images viewed at 100% magnification on a 24"" computer monitor, but when viewed at 50% magnification (closer to relative default print size), 300mm images look fantastic. More importantly, at 300mm it produces images that print with excellent resolution at 11x16"".CAs are the one clear weak point for the Tamron lens but they are easily corrected via basic post-processing of RAW images (maybe JPEGs too?). AF speed is similar to the Nikon 55-200 VR AF-S lens and VERY accurate in good lighting.At around $140, this lens is a remarkable value and worthy of a 5-star Amazon rating, though I'd give it 4.5 stars if that option were available."
2,"Got this for D40x , too much CA","I waited a whole week with anticipation for this lens. Now after trying for 2 days I'm very disappointed.I have a Sigma 70-300 for my D70 (which works great) but can't work with my D40x so I ordered the Tamron because I heard it was pretty good. It shoots far and is about the same softness as the Sigma and would be a great lens but the CA (color fringing) is terrible. I live near the ocean and take lots of photos of ocean activities, surfing, canoe races etc. Purple color fringing was a big problem. Had to use photoshop to remove it, too much work.I have owned Tamron lenses in the past with film SLRs and they were wonderful, but not this one.Would I recommend this to anyone? Only if they can't or don't want to spend the money for the Nikon 70-300mm. I wish that I would have gotten the Nikon or Sigma with HSM. Which I am now looking into.So if you want just a basic 70-300mm lens then this will probably work for you."
3,Buy if price is a big concern,"I bought this lens because of the price and though it is a fair lens, you get what you pay for. The lens is relatively show and sometimes takes a while to lock onto the subject. It has good range though, being a 70-300 lens. Also, because of a lack of image stability, I'd advise shooting on continuous or simply taking multiple snaps of the subject, especially at the higher focal lengths. How useful the macro feature is debatable seeing as how you must be three feet from the subject and the Nikkor 70-300 I tries out seems to focus from close to that same distance without having macro.All in all, I'd recommend it solely for someone who just need a basic 70-300 lens and doesn't have much money to spend. Just know that because of the softness of the photos that you may have to tinker with your camera's sharpness settings or just sharpen in Photoshop. That being said, I have some really nice shots I did with the lens still."
1,Tamron Tamron AF70-300 F/4-5.6 Di,"I purchased this lense in a package deal, the first lense I got would not auto focus and it shuddered when trying to do so and was noisey when opperating, I took it back to the dealer, and he replaced it with another, this one focused ok but again it was not smooth, or for that matter quiet when doing so, I found I could not use this lense when opperating my DSLR in video mode as the noise of the auto focus motor fed over the audio track of the video, to be quite truthfull I feel that this lense is not worth the money people pay for it, as this was part of the camera package I purchased, I still feel short changed on what I got, if this is the quality of Tamron lenses, I will not be buying anymore any time soon, and I would advise anyone to put the extra cash towards what you want and get a decnt lense and certainly not Tamron"
2,You Get what you pay for,"Any pictures taken with this lens over 200mm will be pretty much useless, the lens also takes too long to autofocus, which means you will miss shots, for the price of this lens (cheap), it is what it is, I would spend more for a better lens next time."
3,Not the lens for me,"I thought for the price the pictures were OK. The lens could be sturdier. I'm not sure what happened, my lens took some bumps while I was traveling, but it wound up with a small plastic piece broken and wouldn't come off my Canon 7D. I was panicked. Thankfully, I have it off with no damage to the camera. The lens is shot, but insured. I'm replacing it with a used L-series 70-200. After this experience, I will think more about durable build. If you are gentle on your equipment, like in a studio not running around outdoors, and don't need top notch glass for crisp results, this lens might be fine for you."
1,Not compatible with the Sony NEX5 and LA-EA2,"The Amazon information for the Sony LA-EA2 states that A-mount lens will autofocus ""AF motor allows A-mount lenses to be used with E-mount camera bodies"".This lens is a Sony A-mount, BUT it is not compatible with the Sony LA-EA2. Auto focus does not work and after discussions with Sony they confirmed that there was a compatibility issue with this lens.It's a good lens as long as you are using the above configuration."
4,Very pleased for the price.,"I ordered this lens to pair with my wifes XSI and my T3I,I wanted something other then the kit lenses, that would provide the ability to reach out and shoot photos from a distance, I'm very pleased with it. The reaction time is acceptable, and it takes nice shots. I will definitely look at Tamron for more lenses in the future."
1,Power loss and picture blurry!,I connect it to hook up one of our CCTV camera over 100ft long and the picture is ok; but I when I hook up other cameras over 200ft long and the pictures are so blurry and power loss often. The price was cheaper than everywhere but its quality is poor.Do not purchase this cheap quality wire which power loss and video picture blurry.
5,Excellent CD if you like the old ones.,"This CD has some great old ones. Features the bass singer on several of the twelve songs. If you wish your 8-track hadn't worn out in the 70's, then this CD is for you."
5,Very Informational,This is very helpful and instrumental in many situations you will encounter as a professional.
5,David Gray - Stll the man,"David Gray was the 'next big thing' when this debut was released in 1993, and at the time was given glowing reviews by all who listened.The album 'A Century Ends' is quite simply a masterpiece, and more impressive since its a debut. Theres not a dud on the album, and you'll be hard pressed to take it out of your CD player once you put it in.3 albums have followed, each impressive in its own right, but only 'White Ladder' equals 'A Century Ends' in brilliance.ESSENTIAL LISTENING"
5,Buy it!,Sublime and haunting are the melodies and lyrics of David Gray. I have listened endlessly to this album for the past four years and been moved every time.
5,Spirit awakening music,"If you have not heard this CD, please go out and purchase it now. It is an amazing compilation of chilling lyrics. His soul and spirit are so alive and so vibrant. I continue to listen to it over and over again."
4,A VERY AUSPICIOUS BEGINNING!,"Recently I watched a televised interview with world famous actor, Michael Caine praising Feng Shui methods of colors, and furniture arrangements, for the success of a restaurant he owns. Feng what? I thought. After reading this book, I now have a basic understanding of what it means. It is an ancient chinese systematic approach to creating harmony in your environment which somehow supports your health, career, and spiritual growth. I like the step by step explanations and directions. A very basic and auspicious beginning for those interested in exploring ways to transform their living space. Making the complex simple, is not so easy. The author has presented a fine guidebook."
3,"A lot better than other westernized books, but lacking","This book is a good start for people, but the astrological charts are too simplified, since the Chinese New Year changes yearly. This book is easy to read, but if you really want to learn about traditional feng shui in depth, this is not the book."
1,Not the one:(,"I am brand new to Feng Shui and recently picked up two books. Unfortunately, this was one of them! (The other being ""101 Feng Shui Tips for Your Home"". Thank goodness I read that one first -in one evening, and got a grasp on the concept. I found this book misleading because the cover makes it seem like a beginners guide (""step-by-step"" blah blah), furniture placement, etc., when in actuality, this book was highly technical and confusing. It demands way too much time, concentration and adaptation for it's principles to click! -perhaps after a few simple less structured books, this highly technical one will make more sense. But for now, this is the first book I will ever be returning to Amazon! -no wonder in the preface he says 'don't jump around, read each page'. He knows what he's talking about. You just want to skip it and cut to the chase. -which never happens."
4,Sweet story!,"I thought this was a great depiction of what happens to a number of women that live a traditional life. When that doesn't work, like their husband, they end up seeking what they lack in their marriage. This was a well written story and I enjoyed the positive portrayal of women in love. Its good to see a movie without the usual lesbian drama. The husband did not make me happy but I don't want to include any spoilers."
1,Pathetic Film a true waste of time,This is one of the worst films I have ever watched. We actually saw this in a theatre in Boston while on vacation many years ago. We were excited to see a lesbian film. In those days they were rare. Even more so to be played in a mainstream cinema. I wish I had asked for a refund for our tickets. The film Clare de moon is on the top of the worst lesbian films ever made. Back then I guess it was considered acceptable and on the edge as people were still very much in the closet. Low budget and cheesey all the way. Save your money.
3,Putting in my 2 cents,"I recently began to collect lesbian films and the truth is that it's not easy to find good ones. I ordered this film because the reviews that I read on it seemed very good, but honestly I was a little dissapointed (again). I felt that the characters in this film had very little chemistry between them. The kissing was terrible, and the sex scene was definately not very hot...a little believable chemistry would have been good. The films was made in the 80's which is another negative. The bar scene was terrible, I thought it would never end. Any way I'm no expert on films put I do know when a film moves me and this one certainly did not. Please be your own judge."
4,GOOD REVIEW BOOK,"GOOD REVIEW, WITH WELL WRITTEN CLINICAL CASES WITH EXPLANATIONS, AND VERY GOOD FOR THE PRICE LISTED. HIGHLY RECOMEMMENDED BOOK FOR INTERNS AND RESIDENTS, OR FOR THE DAILY PRACTICE."
4,Time travel is thrilling!,"The story was good--intriguing, imaginative with clarity of description that even I could visualize it! In addition to the writing of it, I can't imagine what must have been involved in producing a tape!--Characters, music, and everything!"
4,Muy buena,Excelente trama. No imagine jamas q las andanzas irian al Oriente tan lejano y distante en el s. XI. Pude rastrear el viaje teniendo un mapa al lado. Ahora a seguir con la trilogia
4,Un médico de hace 1000 años,"En esta novela Noah Gordon muestra una trayectoria de vida con detalles de diversas culturas y el nivel de la medicina a comienzos del año 1,000.Es apasionante por la intensidad de sus protagonistas ,aunque el final es más bien calmo."
4,El medico del siglo XI,"Extraordinaria novela, muy ilustrativa de los usos y costumbres de la epoca; se aprecia un estudio y conocimiento detallado de parte del autor sobre las sociedades que nos muestra en la obra. Logra describir no solo el ambiente sino se adentra en el alma de los personajes, en muchos pasajes es conmovedora. No solo entretiene sino tambien educa. La vision que nos da de la Inglaterra de inicios del siglo XI y del Medio y Lejano Oriente, nos lleva a visualizar un mundo donde el verdadero conocimiento y cultura superior se encontraban en aquellas tierras lejanas a los actuales centros de poder mundial."
3,Constantly replacing,"We seem to replace our Braun gold coffee filter about every 6-8 months. Inevitably, small holes/tears begin to appear on the bottom or sides of the filter. We've tried washing by hand instead of putting the filters in the dishwasher, but it makes no difference."
3,Doesn't fit all cone style coffee makers,"We bought this filter today because the package said it would fit every #4 cone style coffee maker on the market. Well, it doesn't. We own a Kitchenaid, and it didn't fit ours. I'm sure this would be a great filter if we had the right kind of machine."
5,A sure way to advance an intermediate knowledge of French.,"This dicitionary is most useful as a single source to intermediate or advanced users of French as a second language. Fluent users of the language may find this useful as a portable adjunct to other, more specific dictionaries. Beyond the English-French/French-English dictionaries is the single-language dictionary, and the LaRousse de Poche is a hefty, but still portable, reliable, and respected source. It is up-to-date, and older usages have been deleted. Standard to most dictionary style, the tome presents all nuances of words, in numbered groups. Most words include idomatic usages that are then explained in French. The only true lack: any etymologies, though one could presume most entries would read ""L > FA"" (Latin to ancient French)."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen.,"Saw this on SyFy one weekend. The effects, acting, and the whole thing is HORRIBLE. Totally looks like a college film project. I can't believe this made it to TV then DVD. Good having friends in high place, apparently. Don't waste your time! Move along."
1,F&%k U SYFY Channel !!!,"SyFy Channel, I love you, but this was a cheap, cheap money steal of your program's audience.This is NOT ""Battle: Los Angeles"" but your timing and story tries to be to divert our attention and money.And it's a horrible rag, boiler plate, clone, whatever!"
1,why are there no neg.stars?,"This POS should be a -5 star rate.I have loved sci fi for 40 years,from a to z flicks,and can mostly find something to like.first there is not a level on which this turkey does not suck.second it is poorly done,I mead bad.It is one of the most race bateing movies ever.The title should be Kill Whitey,but they kill some black men when they run out of white ones.your heros are some taco bell chick,and an Chinese chick."
1,This is NOT Battle:Los Angeles.....it is a FAKE,"This item is the first result when you search ""Battle Los Angeles"", so please be aware that this is not the fantastic Sony Pictures movie being advertised on TV and playing in theaters ""3.11.11"" This is a ""mockbuster"" product from Asylum Studios.Do not waste your time with this trash!!!!!!!"
1,Cheap Knock-off,"I can't believe they haven't been sued over this. It's a straight-to-SyFy movie, so you can pretty much guaruntee that it won't be any good. I understand that they want to cash in on the fever surrounding new theater releases, but this and last week's Almighty Thor have hit a new low--bad movies, not for their own sake, but made to directly mimic good ones for the purpose of confusing consumers into buying their product by mistake.This, coupled with the 90-minute prime time WWE matches, makes me wonder if SyFy is perhaps losing money and in danger of being scrapped."
1,Awful,"Sorry if you rented this thinking it was the bigger budget movie. Me too. Just awful. Not even campy enough for a MST3000 home-snark night. Just awful, and I like cheesy sci-fi. Unfortunately, the Tivo interface doesn't show customer reviews so I bought it before I knew."
3,We likes this SyFy Sci-Fi opus !,"Nia Peeples, Kel Mitchell,Tim Abell and Dylan Vox.Could not beleive how many tributes to classic science fiction movies.Has everything going for it,Serious acting,Apocalypse sets, Uber machines,Tough female leads and developed males in support.lets discuss the computer animation aka CGI, Its good and Bad...Mostly good and creative looks owing to a budget that must be shocking,Yet enough for the needed scenes.The lighting is even a strong point pulls you into beleif of situation of the moment.Good job Asylum & SyFy and Mark Atkins who wrote and directed."
1,blaugh!!,"The Scyfy network makes excellent TV shows but awful movies. This was by far awful. It was cheaply done from beginning to end. Can't say much more then ""Don't buy""."
1,Suckered,"Damn, am I Pi#@^d off or what? I got suckered real good, I thought this DVD was the biggie recently screened in our movie thearters here in OZ. Reading these reviews I wonder if I am going to 'invest' 90mins of my life watching this movie when it is presented and sold as if it is the big budget movie staring Aaron Eckhart that I would class in my top 5 movies EVER and the best Sci Fi movie EVER I have seen. Well DVD and movie people, what do you think? Should I or should'ent I watch this peice of .........."
1,Oops. Wrong Planet,"Cheaply done, poorly written, bad FX. Not even in the So Bad It's Good category. The movie has no set up, little explanation and characters so clumsy that cartoon dialog balloons should be appearing above their heads. Really, it is that awful. I expect the SyFy channel will repeatedly air this till you somehow see it, but do your best to avoid it. Unless you want to know the answer to the question: What Ever happened to the Kel half of Keenan and Kel."
1,Complete Rip-Off,"The SyFy Channel made this film.... should be the first warning.. This is not the movie you expect to buy, it is not the blockbuster ""Battle: Los Angeles"" The SyFy Channel thought it would be cute to put out a movie with a similar title and sell it.... This movie is TRASH! Do not buy!!!!"
1,B-Movie,"Worst movie I have ever seen! I thought it would be a movie with good quality, but I ended up tossing the dvd in the trash, after the first viewing."
1,"ASYLUM did this - It's not ""Battle: Los Angeles"".","Another in their low-rent ripoffs of popular titles, avoid this if you're looking for ""Battle: Los Angeles"" currently in the theaters."
5,GREAT MOVIE,"I think this is a great movie enjoyed watching it the whole family hard fun, and for the people that got this movie confused with the one at the movie theaters and are mad about it, dont be mad at the movie be mad at your self for being dumb, but anyways its a great movie well worth the money"
3,"Beware - This Is Not The ""Battle: Los Angeles"" In Theaters ""3.11.11""","This pre-order item is the first result when you search ""Battle Los Angeles"", so please be aware that this is not the Sony Pictures movie being advertised on TV and playing in theaters ""3.11.11"" This is a ""mockbuster"" product from Asylum Studios.Battle: Los Angeles (Sony Pictures) is here:Battle: Los Angeles (Blu-ray)|Battle: Los Angeles (DVD)It is not available for pre-order yet, but you can sign up to be notified of when it is."
1,Don't Waste Your Time Or Money,"This movie will be shown on the SyFy channel March 12th, 2011. Most of those made for TV movies on the SyFy channel are not very good. Some producers and directors these days don't know how to make a good SciFi movie. Hopefully this movie will be an exception.Update: I just finished watching it. I'd give it no stars if possible. This ranks as one of the worst scfi movies I've ever seen."
1,NOT INDEPENDENCE DAY,"The movie runs along the same theme as Independence Day, except it takes place in a studio city called ""Los Angeles. We don't have much character building before the aliens invade. These aliens appear to be based on early sketches of Star Wars contraptions. The real downside is that these super aliens use conventional weapons; no lasers or special bombs. The movie is mostly gun play. It would have made for a great video game, but as movie it was not worth the view."
3,Great action flick,"The ""War of the Worlds"" thing has been done and done again. It still offers plenty of creative scope, as this fast action flick goes to show. Seeing L.A. in ruins is pleasant enough, cool alien hardware, heroic heros, and lots of combat really make this movie. And, by the way, the cute, battle-hardened Latina makes her appearance, too. When did she turn into such a common figure in action movies? Not that I'm complaining.I would have expected this to be a summer movie. Summer movies have been getting better, though, with bette plots, characters, and all the other things that make a movie memorable, so the competition might have swamped this one. Still, it's enjoyable commodity entertainment: fun, but completely forgettable.-- wiredweird"
3,No review,"Sorry. It's certainly anything but simple to review so soon a textbook on computer science, which comprises 1605 pages nd which I've bought in order to learn to deal with software and hardware problems single-handed. Maybe in a year, or so, not now."
1,"Minutia, minutia, minutia","Seeing as my computer blew up(the power supply), quite literally, I was in need of a definitive book for repairing my computer and replacing such fried parts as my motherboard, power supply, processor, etc. I went to Scott Mueller for help. To say this book was kind of unhelpful would be like saying a PI is kind of slow - if you catch my drift. When it comes to going into mind-numbing detail over useless minutia, I've got to hand it to Scott Mueller. When it comes to providing relevant information, pictures, illustrations, and tips that might actually be of use, however, he does not quite fit the bill, so to speak. He's downright Terrible(caps intended). Try Michael Meyers and his A+ book instead - much better."
2,Be aware & Experieince,I'm sure that this is probably a good product. However there are two things to consider when ordering: 1) this product has aspartame in it so anyone on a restrictive regiment or has a sensitivity to this sweetener should be-aware. 2) I ordered this product twice and twice they sent the wrong flavor. How chocolate looks like banana is a mystery. Had to return twice!
5,Excellent!,"Great product. this is the second time i order from this company and once again, speedy shipping AND free samples!"
5,Ultramet powder,"This is, for me, a great meal replacement product to be used both pre-workout in a blended fruit and yogurt drink and post workout by itself. The best price I have found is here on Amazon and will purchase again as I have in the past."
1,Garbage,This product will not mix in my shaker. Two minutes of vigorous mixing in my Blender Bottle and still large clumps and dry powder stuck to the inside. The taste is OK but not good. This is the worst meal replacement shake I have used.
2,Melissa and Dough anything but a piano,"Okay, so my 1 year old son was facinated with this piano. But it sounds horrible. I mean Awful. In fact, we were afraid that the sound, which is very and very and VERY off tune, will ruin his musical inclination. I dont mind the chime - but its too off tune. So we packed it up and back it goes."
2,Very disappointed Mom,"I was so excited when my son received this as a birthday gift and he loves to sit and bang on it for a few minutes at a time. But when I tried to play some of the songs for him from the Songbook, I couldn't even recognize the songs half the time because the piano is so off key. Particularly the E. I was further disappointed with the songbook because it doesn't feature notes, just large color circles with the letter of the key in the middle that don't quite fit over the staff, so if you are interested in your child learning to read music, this will not be very useful. We are not planning to keep the piano, I'm just looking for a replacement (perhaps a keyboard) so that I can make the switch."
3,"Cute, but come on","The piano is cute as is the picture with the little girl playing it. So cute I was duped into buying it last Christmas. As another reviewer said, the sound is horrible and one of the keys didn't work correctly on my daughter's piano. I can't bear to get rid of it because of it's cuteness, but it has only amused my now four-year-old for a few minutes at a time. I was hoping for something that would last until she matured a little further. Or maybe I should have bout this when she was two. My overall rating of three is because of (you guessed it) its cuteness."
1,Should be recalled,"My 2-year old daughter wanted this for Christmas so we got it from a local store -in the box, never saw it out on the floor. What a mistake! It sounds terrible! It is so off-tune one wonders if the makers had ever heard a piano before. ALSO, the construction is crap. Screw-in legs for a top-heavy thing like this... they NEVER stay tightened. I'm always expecting it to come crashing down when she's playing it - which is rarely. Her $10 xylophone is more musical."
3,Terrible customer service,"I purchased two Melissa and Doug pianos for my two grandchildren for Christmas presents. I received my shipment on Dec 15. On December 23 I opened the box which was to contain 2 pianos and found only one. I called UPS to see if I was missing a box--no. I called FatBrains Toys and receive a message that ""the elves have gone home to be with their families for Christmas"" Me with no Christmas present for my grandchildren. I called and emailed Melissa and Doug put their mailbox was full. There was no backorder of the item and I was billed for two.Finally, after much complaining and being without a Christmas present for one of my grandchildren, I received the second piano on December 31. The only way I received the second piano was because they sent me someone else piano. Perhaps that were my original went."
4,Purchased this piano for daughter's 2nd b-day.,"My daughter is a couple inches short of being 3' tall. This piano is the PERFECT size for her. I believe the piano is recommended for 4 yr olds and up, but I think it will be too small for them. She loves it. It was a great buy and a great price. One of the keys doesn't work properly, but she doesn't mind. A+ Buy."
1,company refuses to replace or give any info to where parts that have been broken can be replaced,"Trying to fix broken leg and lost screws and round silver disk that tops them. tried to call 3 times to their service center, 1st time was told they would call me back with info...they did not. Sent email, they said to call again & they could help me. I called again and was told they were the manufacturer but did not supple any parts. Told them I would be happy to buy them..They said NO they didnt do that & they never give any info about the company or their people in China????? Why? they have about 30 employees here in the states..over 1000 in China. I have brought many of their products....I will no longer...what are they trying to hide??? Could there be lead or other band materials they are using for thier toys?"
2,Sounds Awful!,"We bought this toy for our son's 3rd birthday. We were very excited since our son loves music and has other musical instruments that he likes to play with. We have purchased various other Melissa & Doug toys that we are VERY pleased with. This piano is very cute, but we cannot get pass the AWFUL sound. The sound resembles that of a piano, but thats as close as it gets. If we had to do it again, we would not purchase this item. The sound is unaccepable even for a toy. In the future, we will be very careful about making on-line purchases of musical instruments by Melissa & Doug. They missed the mark on this one!"
5,Bellagio perfume purchased at Amazon,This was a tremendous value. I bought it as a gift and the recipient was delighted to get it. It's going on my own wish list as well.
4,Very good transaction,Shipped the next day and received in one day. Very good transaction. Will buy again and recommend to friends.
5,Excellent Sheets for a fantastic price!,I didn't expect such great quality and softness for a fantastic price. They even fit my deep pillow top mattress without a problem! I also bought a twin set for my son - he loves them too!
5,Warmth and Comfort,"I love thes sheets! They fit nicely on the bed, have a great feeling against the skin and provide a little extra warmth on those cold winter nights! They're the best!"
5,Too cute!,"These sheets are adorable, and they were a wonderful price! We have had them for over a year now, and they have held up great."
5,This stuff really helps!,"I am helping with a family where the mother died unexpectedly. The children are young and more than a handful for their grief-ridden father. Having no kids yet myself, I feel I lack patience and understanding not only for the sorrow they may be experiencing, but for the sheer fact that they are still CHILDREN! Thanks for your help, it was a real God-send."
1,Not what I expected,"It's about obedience, not about cooperation. It gives tips how to make kids obey your rules. The author is against spanking and yelling, but it's OK for she to use your authority over kids to force them to obey you She mostly recommends technics of punishments and rewards, although she mentioned such things like Natural Consequences, Anger Management, Active Listening, and such. The book is full of general words and phrases. It was not what I was searching for."
1,Lecturing author!,"I did not find this book helpful at all. The author tends to lecture while putting parents who unknowingly make mistakes into ""cutesy"" little categories like ""Nagging Nellie, Whining Wilma, Betty Briber, Counting Casey and Bret Threat"".I don't know about you, but I don't want to be labeled and then lectured. I want good, sound advice from someone who knows that no kid or parent is ALWAYS perfect.The first turn-off for me in this book was a ""quiz"" that's supposed to tell you what kind of parenting style you have. All this did was put the ""good"" parents and the ""bad"" parents in two separate piles with praise going to the ""good"" or Balanced Parents -- ""oh you perfect little parents, you've done your homework and shouldn't even be reading this book!""I think this author needs a few more parenting classes herself!Do yourself a favor. Read 1-2-3 Magic instead!"
5,Kid Cooperation,"Love this book. Let my daughter use it and may have to buy another one. We realize and know many of these teachings, but need reinforcement and constant reminder. This book is the one. There is so much I have/are learning, I wish I found this book or one like it when my kids were youngsters. I recommend this to all people struggling to raise children or even grown adult offspring, and in controlling ones anger and frustrations, making the road a little smoother in life, for everyone."
5,Wish I read this before I had children,I can not say enough about this book. I wish I read it before I had children - check that- before my first hit 18 months. Furthermore this will be a gift to any first time Moms I know. The book starts out with a parenting style evalutation. Then turns into clear and easy to read chapters on successful parenting tools; and demonstrating the examples of typical parenting situations - juxtaposed to a better solution of that situation. Every chapter also ends in a review page which you could copy and post on your fridge. Don't pass this one up!
4,Air Bags 2003 GMC Yukon XL,"Product works good, just don't over-inflate. Max. pressure 35-40 psi unlike the other airbags they sell. Helps level out SUV when pulling Toyhauler camper. Definitely worth the money to me."
4,Money well spent,It takes longer then 1 hour to install it but over all it's not to bad. I am glad i install them in my 2007 suburben. The ride is like night and day.
1,Bad experiences with this changer,"I'd be wary of this changer. The first one I bought failed mechanically (disk door wouldn't open) after 14 months of fairly frequent use. I rather foolishly (in retrospect) bought an identical model to replace it. This one failed after only 5 months. It plays one disk, but then hangs up and requires restarting to play another. I don't know whether this is a poor product or just chance, but I thought I ought to let people know about it."
1,Poor product,"We ordered one of these CD players as a Christmas gift to ourselves. The first one arrived and did not work. The CD tray would not spin. We returned it and just received our second one. It does not work either! The tray spins, but there are places where it gets stuck. If you put a CD in spots 1-3, it will find them and play them. But if you put a CD in slot 4 or 5, it doesn't find them. Also, when you hit the disc skip button to proceed to the next disc, sometimes it moves one disc over, sometimes it moves a few discs over, sometimes it starts spinning and spinning and doesn't stop. So, we give up. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt with one faulty player, but not with two in a row. There are obviously serious quality control issues with this product."
4,adequate,"The purchase was made with the knowledge that the product was a dinosaur of technology. However, it fit my needs. It is a good product for seniors who cling to their old systems."
3,"Could be a 5 star, but...","For the most part this CD player is a good value for it's price. Functions correctly & has good musical quality. The draw back is that the unit produces a very audible humm when turned on. Luckily I have my stereo equipment in one room & the speakers in another, so the humm doesn't interfere with the music."
1,TEST IMMEDIATELY,"This product did not work. Period. Unfortunately I did not test it within the ridiculously small return window so I will get almost nothing back on my return. If you still buy this, which I strongly recommend against, test the product immediately and don't wait."
2,Disappointing carousel function,"Sound is great with no background hiss are machinery noise, but the carousel malfunctions in that it is almost impossible to play the disc in slot no. 1."
3,Average,"I am debating on this item as the issue might be attributed to the discs that are inserted. However, those same discs are working just fine in a different changer or player.For the price, I guess it is okay but not convinced that this carousel does the job as expected."
1,Bad purchase,"This product arived with no remote control or owners manual. The power cord has so many twisted curves it must have been hanging in the wind for weeks. There is someting very strange with this purchase. I don't believe it's new, but I paid the new price."
2,Unreliable,"I have had this player since Feb., and am very disappointed with it. It is extremely slow in reading the cd's.It also has a problem reading cd's that are not factory. I've always been told that Teac is a superior productand that's why I bought it, but never again."
5,Excellent CD player,"Had carousel cd player for 5 months. Great sound, quiet operation. Seems to able to read all discs (no disc err)."
4,good retro mp3 playback,it works great though it's a little slow opening and closing and it takes acouple of second loading but aside from that its a great device and it was for a good price. The styling is alittle retro compared to something like harmon kardon but I had used products from them in the past and they make quality devices and I also purchased it because it plays mp3 disk.
1,disgusted,I ordered this TEAC product from Amazon after looking at several different optional ones. I have(had) other TEAC products and have been happy with those. This one would not read a CD. Obviously the quality control did not exist or there was damage(not noticeable) during shipping. I probably will not order another electronic component on line and have to experience the hassle of this order.
1,Worst piece of junk money could buy,"I actually bought this product as a return item and knew it was used. I know I should have gone with my gut feeling, but instead, bought it hoping that I wouldn't receive a ""lemon."" I read reviews and was conflicted because some said, ""great"" and others, ""ungreat."" (I know ungreat is not a word but you get my point.) Anyhow, the changer would simply turn on and off, open and close, and nothing else! so today I returned it and hope to do a little more research before I decide to buy a cd player/changer."
4,does what i want it to do,"I needed something to play my collection of mp3s which i had burned to disk.more difficult to find than i thought. No home theater for me, just want to play my music through my receiver. Well, this does the job, but reminds my of a cd changer i bough about 15 years ago, plus the ability to play mp3s. not really a complaint, it goes well with my old Kenwood receiver and plays stuff just like i want, it just looks kind of old fashioned. Would give an extra star if it had some kind of ultra modern styling, but then it would make the old equipment it is hooked up to look obsolete."
5,Great basic player,We were interested in a unit that plays audio CDs and MP3 data disks and this unit exactly fits the bill. Sound is good and the features are exactly as advertised.
2,Returned .,Did not like the Teac. Decided to Purchase Sony. I had good results in the Sony CD player from paence/st experi
1,Short Lived Equipment,This equipment did not work very long and had to be replaced with another unit. I do not feel it was a good value for the money.
4,"Works good, with one issue.","Satisfied with product and shipping. The only issue when we set up this unit was that the remote funcntionality would not work with the Logitech Harmony remote. The remote that came with the unit is just fine, but we were trying to reduce the number of remotes :-(. They could state that this product is not compatible with many universal remotes. I would have paid more for this functionality."
3,I should have read the reviews.,"I should have read the reviews on the Teac player before I purchased it. I sent it back to your company. It did not shuffle all songs on all discs.--Its quality was ok,"
3,look at dvd player instead,ok so far but not having a power button on the remote is an absolute annoyance. sounds good but that's dependent on the type of connection to your amplifier and the quality of your speakers . cd players have a 1-bit d/a converter as opposed to a dvd player with a 10-bit converter. i'll go dvd player next round.
2,Russian Roulette,"After struggling with a friend for an hour trying everything in the world to make this player work, I had to give up and put it back in the box. It would sometimes play the CD in tray 3, but ignored all the other trays and would just sit there doing nothing. Save yourself the heartache--DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER!!!!!!ADDENDUM--8/14/12Because I couldn't find another changer that was 15"" or less deep to fit in my entertainment center, I took a chance and re-ordered this changer. The second one works perfectly and sounds great...today. I'll keep you posted about how long it lasts."
3,"turntable is weak, gets totally confused",This MP3 CD changer held up for about 14 months. My Mother listens to books on it about 8 hours a day. We never used the programming functions but the turntable mechanism had to be repaired once under it's warranty and now I have just put it down in the basement to be recycled.
2,Jumped in price,I was about to make a purchase when it was $105. I had it added to my shopping cart. Then the price jumped to $127. So the lost my purchase. Sorry! Change back the price and I'll buy.
2,Teac sucks,"I've owned several multi CD players, all Sony, but when I needed to replace one of them, I bought this Teac. Unfortunately, the ""shuffle"" mode only shuffles within one CD, not among all 5, as do all the Sony's. In addition, you can't turn the damn thing on or off with the remote. Had I known, I definitely would not have bought it, but it isn't worth the trouble to return it. However, my advice--never buy TEAC. (I have a very old Teac open reel machine that I haven't used in decades but which seemed fine, but I guess the company went downhill since.)TEAC PD-D2610 5-CD Carousel Changer with MP3 CD Playback"
2,if you want shuffle features,"if you want to shuffle discs this is not good ,, there is no shuffle button on the unit , you have to use the remote , also it will not shuffle discs ,, only one disc at a time , then goes to the next disc"
5,TEAC PD-D2610 CD Player,I'll keep this short and sweet.I had to replace an old Sony carousel cd player on my musicsystem which was tied into my Logitech 880 universal remotewhich I got from Amazon and my Denon AVR receiver.Installation of the new cd player was a breeze.Deleting the old player and reinstalling the new player on theuniversal remote was also a breeze.Within 20 minutes of delivery I was up and playing music again.The hardest part was watching the UPS driver slip and slide up my steep icy driveway.
1,DOA,"It was Dead On Arrival. The 5-CD turntable would not turn to load CDs. No CD would play :-(However, I just love the Amazon return policy. The item was confirmed as DOA and back in the box with return shipping label within an hour."
1,Doesn't work,"Out of the box this unit did not work. Tried old & brand new cd's but this unit would not get past reading the disk & sitting there on track one & not playing. Jumped through a number of hoops to try to get it going, but nada. Tks mucho to Amazon for a relatively painless return."
1,Breaks Easily,"Bought mine new here at Amazon. It worked initially but within a few months it stopped working. It simply wouldn't play. I had to throw it out. It's easy to fall for the MP3 versatility compared to one without it, but I strongly recommend buying one without MP3 if you want to mainly listen to CD's - or just find another brand."
2,Quality below standard,Tray was sluggish to open and close and when loading the CD's it would not always stop at the next slot. Sound quality was good and it played properly once loaded.
4,Good Value for the price,"After correcting some connection problems, we are very pleased with the performance. The music is clear and it plays both the CD's and MP-3's without any problems. We previously had a high-end CD (CD's only)player and there is no loss in sound quality and this one also plays the MP3's we are adding to our CD collection. To date, we are completely satisfied with our purchase"
1,quite after 2 hours,"The player worked for about 3 hours, then the remote stopped working. I put in new batteries and still no luck. I did not know whether it was a defective remote or if the sensor on the unit was defective, so I returned the unit. I later ordered a Yamaha CD player and am pleased with it.I have used TEAC products before and had no problems, but I didn't want to take a chance on another one of these."
1,Didn't work,"Didn't work at all. Returned it and ordered the Sony. Too bad, my previous Teac lasted 18 years. I don't know if it's poor QC or hidden shipping damage, but it's the first device I've ever received that didn't work at all. The lights would come on but that was it."
4,"Great sound, but a little tough to get 100% function","This component provides great sound to my system. I give it 4 stars rather than 5 because it took 2 shipments to get a fully functional player. The front display panel of the first player did not work, though the remote worked and the component played CDs. Kudos to Amazon for a no-charge replacement."
5,cd player,needed a replacement player to play christmas music. we had a teac b/4. easy hook up and go.
5,OMIGOD IT'S GREAT!,"Sacrebleu had its moments; Playboy Mansion made me a fan; After the Playboy Mansion was equally great. From track 1 of the first disc, ""In the House"" amazes. Dimitri's ear for music is without peer. There is a retro flair to his choices, but with impeccable taste. This will be getting unending play at many a hip joint over the next several years. Awesome."
3,Dimitri in the Disco,"House is DEFINITELY a stretch here. I think a couple of songs would fit this description, but for the most part, it's good ol' disco. Let's just call it what it is, I think everyone would be happier. I love Joey Negro, and how he puts disco INTO house music, and I know Dimitri is fully capable of this... but not this time. For the money, I would have preferred something much much different. Look to the other sets in this series for pure house, look to this set for disco."
1,Total waste of money ... and time,"As a fan of classic house, you can only be disappointed by this performance from Dimitri. It's slow and totally lacks this ""je ne sais quoi"" that makes you get up and move. It's not deep and sounds like it got stuck in a bad TV series from the 70s. Using old school beats as a base is great...as long as it's just a base! Dimitri has done nothing here that takes it to the next level, it just doesn't do it. It's quite far off what I was expecting in terms of excitement..."
3,"Not his best, but still good","I didn't think this was his best CD at all. However, I do recommend for one track called ""Mon Amour"" by Louie Vega. That is the cut! Very spacey and worth checking out. Everything else was just kinda boring. I think his Salsoul remix CD or even ""A Night at the Playboy Mansion"" is alot better."
4,Disc One Will Rock You - Disc Two - Not So Much,The title says it all. It is pure straight up house music/house funk. The first CD is crazy while the second CD leaves something to be desired. Not as great as the first. The third cd has the full length extended versions of 5 previous mixed songs.
3,Good Start,"""The Golden Globe"" is a good beginning for the series. It introduces the characters involved in that first book, before beginning the story, with minor events such as how Anakin Solo is doing in this ""Jedi Academy."" The climax to the story is very exciting--if you are from ages 6-9. I felt it was a good beginning for this new series."
4,A perfect book for young Star Wars Fans,"I think that this book is middling in complex wording, probly created for kids around the ages 8-12. Even though it was a bit slow, and I prefer more complex wording, it was a fairly good book as far as the plot goes. For older readers seeking Star Wars Books, try the Young Jedi Knights series, but this book is a perfect book for a younger reader."
2,Not worth the effort,"I've worn dozens of holsters over the years. This is a generic, may or may not fit the gun it says it will. The suede is stiff as hell. The pivots on the harness are nice but I'd rather have bought a Jackass or Miami Vice harness and added a holster. The offside magazine pouch is bulky and useless as a practical carry item. I wish I'd have spent the money on a Ken Null...Live and learn"
2,Don't throw away your receipt!,"Product looks as if it would work well. HOWEVER, I ran into problems during installation and needed replacement parts. They were quite helpful initially with email but when I had to phone customer service they would not help unless I had the original sales receipt. So I now have a partially installed shield on the front of my iPod, with one corner sticking up,and a back without installation fluid with which to instal it. I can be treated badly for free; why should I pay for the priveledge? I'd probably give the product 5 stars if I could install it but feel generous with the 2 stars considering their customer service policy."
5,Parents should read this book!,"As a parent of two children (now grown and successful), I look back to when they were in school and remember the concerns I had about their progress in learning to read and write. It goes without saying that most parents want their children to do well in school. Being a good reader is certainly a critical factor in how well a child learns any subject. Ms. Hurford's book, ""To Read or Not to Read"", provides invaluable and interesting information for parents about the process of learning to read. It is not just a good reference on dyslexia but also it contains background on testing children to help identify possible reading problems. Parents who have the slightest concern about their children's reading will gain insight from this book. As an added bonus, the portions of the book with short episodes about famous dyslexics are fascinating."
4,Overlooked but excellent,"I thought I had read -- or studied, even -- all the books on dyslexia written for lay audiences. I was wrong. I found Hurford's book at the library.I gave this only four starts because of chapter 8 ""Technology and dyslexia"". This book was published in 1998 -- two lifetimes ago in terms of assistive technology!I would highly recommend this book for any parent who is concerned about his or her child's reading development. I'd also recommend it for any adult who is concerned that he or she may be dyslexic.I found the chapter on ""Detecting and diagnosing dyslexia"" particularly helpful. It demystifies both the process of diagosis and some of the commonly-used tests."
5,"At last, A reproduction you can actually read.",I think the title says it all. I have ordered other reproductions in the past and had to return them because they were absolutely unusable. This one is readable. It is like a good copy machine edition. No strange letters or empty pages. Would definitely buy from again. It also arrived very quickly and was well packed.
4,item lost in delivery,"it lost during the delivery.However, they replied me soon and delivered me soon.It is good."
2,Very Disappointed,"Not as good as I remembered it. This smells like some rancid, watered down version of the real ""Cool Water""."
5,Great golf book!,Bought this golfing book a few days ago. Haven't put it down yet. Each time I pick it up I find something new. Excellent.
4,Good start for Traveller/Space creation,"I bought this book mainly for the world creation tools. Lots of cool stuff on star and world creation, though it's spread out a bit. Would be nice if there were some pages in the back with all the tables you use for rolling up stuff in one place. The main information on the scout corp. is great! Already gave me a couple of scenario ideas. My only beef with the book is the lack of forms. I'm trying to put together a relational database of Traveller based space/planetary info and it's slow going, having to go through every page to find the type of info that needs to be stored. Working from a paper form with all the fields already defined is much easier. Oh well, I find futzing around with stuff like this more fun than actually playing the game. Go figure."
3,"Easily read, but not particularly memorable","A bit above cookie-cutter type romances, the ones where you feel the writer simply followed a how-to book on romances - but just above that level. Maybe the problem was that I was looking for so more more than a romance story with a mystery thrown in. Plus I found it totally unbelievable that a chance meeting would result in a writing assigment for thousands of dollars (as a former freelance writer, I KNOW how hard those assignments are to come by). But those are really minor quibbles. There are some things going for this book - a heroine who is far from perfect, some details that are unique and interesting and above the trite plots of many romances. Still, I could have put this one down at any point. I didn't feel compelled to keep reading it."
2,"Entertaining, if not my favorite Van Wormer","LVW is always good at making believable heroines, and Sally is no exception. Maybe that's why I felt uneasy at the romance between her and Spencer. As Sally states, they both have to 'grow up', and their explosive passion is causing them to rush into an intense relationship. On the other hand, that LVW can have me worry about a ficitonal character says a lot for her writing ability. On the lighter side, I always enjoy reading about the DBS crowd. Although Cassy is a bit too perfect , Alexandra has shaped up well as news diva with nerves of steel. Favorite remains ""Jury Duty""."
4,at last!!!,The reservoir that hold the water is too small----I was constantly filling it up because the steam is so forceful and powerful as it curls the hair easily. I love the fact that it's cordless and the handle is ergomonical. I was trying to get this for 3 or 4 years and finanlly brought it this year and at a great price. The energy cell are expensive (usually two in a package for about $10.00) and they are not easy to find. Walgreens stop carrying them and they're almost only available online. But I prefer curling with steam heat because I don't have to worry about dry brittle and breakable hair which comes from dry curling.
5,Just what Mom needed,"We received a Cuisinart Food Processor, but it came without this attachment. Once we bought the attachment, everything worked great."
3,Horrifying but incomplete,Although this book gives an in- depth account of her it really fails to give a full account of him. I was left wondering what his version was and although there is no doubt they are both monsters reading just this one book on this crime left me feeling there was so much left unsaid. The one shocking and unbelieveable fact is that she could con so many people when it came to saving her skin. Or did she ? I believe the inspector had his own agenda and the best interests of the people didn't enter into it. And now he's bee promoted ? That's as much of a traversty as the whole trial.
5,Disturbing couple.,For those interested in forensic psychology and just basic evil. Homolka got away with murder.
3,not my favourite but OK,"I had seen some of the story on Homolka and Bernardo on discovery channel here in The Netherlands. I was shocked to watch the documentary ,but reading the book was even worse .I agree with the other poster Rebecca that mister Williams is not one of the best writers. On only 2 pages he mentioned the rapes and that was all he wrote on that.I am talking about the period where Bernardo hangs out on the streets raping womenIt wasn't the writing that kept me reading but the amazing story + that it really happened.But when I was nearly finished and came to understand that Karla was going to get away with it, that they fell for her battered women line, I stopped reading. It was a big shock to me. That another accomplish can testify in court and get a plea bargain.some months I picked it up again, after reading many more true crime books, this was one of my first :-), I realised that not all murderers get the punishment they deserve."
4,"good book, sick people","This is a very chilling book, hard to believe there are people this sick out there! It is a quick read."
5,Gripping,"Great novel and a lot of details, definitely not for the faint of heart. Keep in mind this novel reads more like an evidence list more than a story either way I liked it but was deeply disturbed by the content"
3,Difficult to read,"Invisible Darkness : The Strange Case of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka by Stephen Williams Bantam Books, 1997I was interested in reading this book to try and understand who Paul and Karla were and how they ended up like they did. The book is truly horrifying and I don't think I understand any better who these brutal murders really are. If I had been able to read the whole book maybe I would have but after struggling through the killing of Karla's sister and the beginning of the story of the next victim, I was not able to continue.The part I read was well written and certainly graphic. I would not recommend this book to the weak stomached."
3,GOOD BUT COULD BE BETTER,"The merits of this book include excellent background on Karla and unique access to confidential information on her. She is truly a vile, sorry excuse for a human being - worse in many ways than Paul Bernardo himself. But this book has a couple of faults: the writing is sometimes sarcastic and tabloid-like. And the pictues are of very poor quality. This is a worthwhile read, but ""Deadly Innocence"" is the book of choice about this case."
1,This book is very poorly written.,"I've given this book a 1-star because I couldn't give it a 0-star. This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. Although the subject matter is compelling, the writing is putrid. The author -- if one can call him that -- doesn't use transitions. That he doesn't use them to connect paragraphs is bad enough, but he doesn't even use them to connect images, scenes, actions, and ideas within paragraphs. Consequently, the narrative is extremely jarring. On nearly every page, I found myself wondering, ""What the heck is he talking about now?""After awhile it got so frustrating that I threw the book out and purchased one on the same topic by a different author. Any other author has to be better! Don't editors read books before they publish them? I read 7th grade English papers when I was a teacher with better organized thoughts than this book."
1,A book about a couple of sick bastards,A book about a couple of sick bastards and a major screw up on the part of everyone from the cops to the Canadian court system. God help us all.
2,Slanted Misogyny,"Having read the prior two books on this subject, I found this book to be a sad commentary on the author's misogyny. The book clearly is slanted to place the blame for these crimes squarely on Karla Holmolka. The author does not take into account and often omits details which lead Holmolka to be part of these crimes. The blame for the deaths of the two young women belongs squarely on Paul Bernardo. Before Stephen Williams writes a book he needs to get educated on the reality of violence against women, domestic violence and misogyny."
1,Still waiting,"I am still waiting to receive this product, since 3/9/07!!! Very hard to rate something you are still waiting on."
4,Compelling,Few murder cases in Canada have sparked so much outrage and interest as the cases surrounding Paul Bernardo and Karla Hamolka. Stephen Williams gives an in-depth look at their childhood and how they met and how they killed. It also makes light of the justice system (well lack of) we have in Canada. The fact that Ms. Homolka could be out in a few years is sickening and disturbing. She is not a victim and Stephen Williams points that out very well. This book is compelling though not for the weak stomach.
5,A Genuine Modern Female Demon,"Stephen Williams has done an incredible job with his research. Kudos! I must admit that there were times I was tempted to abandon reading because of the uncomfortable reality that Women are indeed capable of being evil, sexual, predators. If you are interested in getting the facts........this is the book to read."
2,not all are facts in this book,I found this to be lacking in true facts. So many points in this book as wrong. For example the couple never bought the house they rented it. Would think that they would have stated that the city had the house destroyed because of it's bad history
4,horrifying that a young girl could be like this,"I found this book to be truly horrifying and hard to comprehend that someone(karla) could be so desperate for a man's love (paul), if that is what you call love. To kill your own sister for the thrill of the sexual ""high"" was just utterly disgusting. I read a lot of true crime and this one rates up there with one of the most horrifying stories I have ever read."
2,To many details,I have read to many true crime books to count them but this is a disgusting book. A lot of needless details. I can't even began to think about how this book hurt the victims families. Enough said.
1,This book is a waste of time. Don't buy it.,The author should focus more on what makes Linux a good OS rather than his rantings about Microsoft. This book was a waste of time. I took it back for a refund.
5,My uncle is the coolest!!,"Being of latin ethnicity, hearing true south american music is awesome, i guess i am prejudice too because my uncle roberto is in the band!! I love you guys and what you stand for!!"
3,Looking into the past,"This book give a look into near past, written in the 50's and published in 1962, give a glimes into a time that is no more, in many ways that is a very good thing. Still interesting to read and see that things have changed. For all of us."
2,May not be what you think....,"The carts in this book are mostly conduit (tube steel) frame carts with bicycle tires,with plywood boxes and seats. They have garden carts, bicycle-drawn carts, a wheelchair cart, a tea cart, a dog/goat cart, and one 2-wheel pony or horse cart. The designs are simple and basic, and the step by step instructions appear to be easy to follow. These are basic, usable carts, not fancy or sophisticated.I was actually looking for a book about how to build nice horse carts and wagons, so this was not really what I was looking for. I will keep the book for now, however, because the one horse cart they do have may be a good first project."
3,book and contents,book was recieved in a timely manner and in great shape. Instructions are difficult to follow if you are a novice carpenter. I had to get some help from someone who knew something about carpentry to help me with my project.
1,misrepresentation,"This is an example of an author using almost identical titles for what would seem to be companion books, but turn out to be unrelated. It seems a sneaky effort to sell a book that would not otherwise be of interest to the people that purchased the first book. The first book is historical . The suggestion in the presentation of the second book is that it is poetry from those about whom the first book was written. However fine the poetry of the second book may be ,it isn't what it seemed to be"
2,This isn't a game - it's a headset.,"Bought it for my son to use with his PS3. I've used Motorola before and liked them, although I have to say PLantronics makes a clearer unit.Well, my son used it for a day, then stopped. When I asked him why, he said it ""doesn't stay connected"" to his PS3. I watched what he did and indeed it drops the bluetooth connection.Motorola has been zero help."
2,its just Okay...,"ProsSetting up this device with my PS3 was easy.Its fun to chat with friends and in game.ConsThe mic is almost satisfactory, the audio is muffled a bit.The fit is terrible. I feel as though I have to sit still in order to keep this thing clipped to my ear.Overall, I think I might check out a USB mic to see if I can get better audio quality and a better fit."
5,Ogio Scores Again,"Like every other Ogio bag I have purchased, this one is a champ. I have filled it to the point of barely being able to life it with no tears, no zipper issues, nothing. Though I will warn that its large size means its easy to make it really heavy and it will get to be a bit annoying. The only downside if the lack of any type of outside water bottle pocket or anything. A small downside. Great bag though."
1,There is no substance.,"I believe the 440 page book can be reduce to an 80 page one without altering contents. Most of the ""ideas"" or ""tactics"" appear to be borrowed from other books or sources, rather than to be gained from the author's own trading experience.Moreover, no issues or ideas in the book are adequately addressed. There is no substance in it.Don't waste your time reading this book."
2,"A spaghetti mess of ""good information""...","I have to agree with the some of the other reviews I've seen on this book. There isa lot of good content and ideas presented, but I found it very difficult to extract anythinguseful. The book has a poorly written almost ""stream of consciousness"" writing style. After a fewchapters, I was so mentally exhausted trying to absorb the concepts as presented, I hadto just put it down and go do something else for a while. The rythm of the writing goes somethinglike this. ""OK do this, but don't do that, but now be careful about this unless you do that first,etc. etc. It is clear that the writer has a lot of knowledge, but in my view the average reader willnot be able to access what he is trying to convey. There is a huge barrier created by this odd-ballwriting style and I doubt most people will have the patience to unravel this spaghetti messof ""good information""..."
