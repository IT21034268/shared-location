1,not worth much,"I am an assistant editor for a publishing house, and I must say that this book is weak. It is the backrunner of an already saturated market. It won't help much in your job search."
3,"Not great, but not horrible","Arrived quickly enough from the seller. The pictures of the horses are not very clear. They are obviously horses, but I wish I could've looked at a bigger photo of them before purchasing. The material they're made of feels kind of like polyester, not cotton. I'm not thrilled with them, but I'm sure my little girl will be."
5,one of my favorites,"This is one of my favorite power metal/ folk metal, and just metal in general albums of all time. seriously i dont know what else to say other than that you should get this. its seriously awesome. White Willow."
5,Knows What He's Talking About,"The erudite Richard Armour strikes again in this witty, true and telling take on colleges and universities -- from campus to roommates, expesnes, faculty advisors and commencement speakers.""Nothing escapes Armour's pen in this jewl of matchless humor."" -- Higher Education Book Review""Fine reading."" -- The New York Times."
3,Good book for people interested in Elections,This is a very informative book about the election of 2000 and many other elections. The book goes through many interesting details of multiple elections and looks at the election of 2000 with a microscope. You need to be very interested in the history of elections to thoroughly enjoy the book though. Not a book that kept me interested the whole way.
3,Everything Dating book is stating nothing new,"It gives some interesting tips about how to join singles activity classes, but I did not feel the book presented any new conceprts. It was all be natural; send pictures in online dating. I was not really impressed, but people with minimal dating experience would benefit from it as a beginner's guide. It is a good place to start, bad place finish though."
3,Better offerings on the topic,"There are better offerings on the market to cover the subject of transits, perhaps the best being Robert Hand's highly-acclaimed Planets in Transit. This book refers to wide orbs as ""trigger points"" and deals very little with angular timing, which many professionals feel is key to predictive astrology."
4,Green Bay Packer Authentic Pro Football Helmet,"The helmet is just as described - an authentic pro football helmet. I do, however, question the ""full size"" description. It is very small and my son is not able to fit it on his head."
4,Only product I could find for smaller dimensions,"The best part of this product is that it actually fits underneath an old wooden desk from my family. I wanted to keep the desk and this made it more ergonomic. It's a great product for the price. It doesn't glide smoothly like the higher end keyboard trays, but I didn't expect it to. The only problem I had is that the mounting brackets meant the required space for installation was actually 1/2 inch wider than the dimensions advertised for the product listing. We bent the bracket to face the other direction and then it worked for my desk."
1,worst effort yet,"Ive always been a big Dregs fan, This album seemed like a quick release with no thought to production quality, and I felt the perfomances also were sub-standard. Buy Bring Em'Back Alive, There is an up to par Dregs Album."
3,Not the Best Dregs,"I agree with the reviewer who says this is substandard work for the Dregs. Inasmuch as everything Steve Morse and the Dixie Dregs do is so much better than almost anything done by anyone else, it's a fine album for the hard-core Steve Morse fan (yes, this includes me) to own. But the sound quality of this effort is not great and the intensity of the music is somehow lacking compared to the band's usual work.My recommendation - if you aren't familiar with Steve Morse and the Dixie Dregs, buy the far superior ""Bring 'Em Back Alive"" as the best possible introduction to the band. You'll also enjoy possibly the finest, heartstopping guitar solo ever recorded."
4,"True Story, Sad for both humans and the bears","I read this book several years ago. I bought the book. I remember when it happened. Such a horrible way for anyone to die. But also sad for the animals, as well, as no doubt many bears were killed before the rangers got to the right ones.Even at that, these bears were just protecting their way of life. I don't believe bears (or any other animal, for that matter), set out todeliberately maim or kill a human. Their scared, I believe. heartbreaking that these very young girlsdied so young and so horrifically."
3,Don't pay top dollar,Don't bother to order a new copy for the prices they are charging on Amazon. The Glacier Association has NEW copies for less than $20.00 and they will ship it to you. Google Glacier Association.
5,"Shocking factual account, bonechilling","I first read this book at 10 years old, then reread it twice as an adult. It is a factual thriller and nobody that has read it will sleep well in Grizzly country in a tent again. I was just searching to see if it was still in print and it is. I am purchasing it for my new wife as we are both avid about the outdoors and love fishing, hiking etc. Bear country is no place to be careless and this book illustrates just how dangerous and unpredictable the great Grizzly can be. While I have a high respect for the animal, I believe you can't be to cautious. This is an unbelievable must read. Buy it, but you might read it with the lights on as this is non-fiction!"
3,Night of the Grizzlies,A well researched account of that night's tragic events. Many suppositions and quasi-facts presented regarding the ecology and behavior of these bears are inaccurate and scientifically unsound. The book reeks of environmentalism run-amuck. Still...this is a worth while read as long as you are able to form your own opinions regarding the bear / man relationship and the under-reported danger these apex predators represent to anyone entering their domain.
5,Page turner - educates while it thrills,"I read this book a two weeks after returning from hiking the Granite Park Chalet area of Glacier National Park (where one of the victims was killed) and so this book was even more chilling for me. The story is extremely well written and very engaging - I couldn't put it down. Olsen laces criticism of the National Park's policies (at the time of the killings) throughout, and effectively builds a sense in the reader of all the mistakes that had been made. As entertainment, this book will keep you on the edge of your seat. As education, hopefully it will remind us that grizzlies are to be respected and managed carefully, and not treated like public amusements or zoo exhibits.By the way, if you like this book, also try ""Mark of the Grizzly"", an excellent collection of bear attack stories which probes beyond the attacks and into the causes. It's up-to-date and really inspires a sense of respect for the great bears."
4,Page turner,"This book was definitely a page turner! Anyone who hikes or camps should read this book! Also, it should be an eye opener for people around dump sites or man-made dump sites which would lead to a bear attractive area. Bears and people don't mix and people need to start respecting wildlife more. With the increase of population, where do bears, cougars and other wildlife go? Even though this occurred years ago, this book really makes you think."
5,Medieval toy sword,Purchased this Medieval toy sword for our grandson after we attended a Medieval Festival and were not able to purchase one there. He is very pleased with it and we have had several mock battles with it already.
4,Worth reading if you're dreaming of writing anything,Starts with a narrative of each screenwriters bio and how they got into screenwriting. Then the book is broken down by topic with each writers response to each topic. This is a good way to analysis successful habits and get a cross-section of personal habits. Cuts through the gloss and gives you a naked view of the grueling hard work that creates success. But something clicked inside me and I started writing.
3,Fine if you like quotes,"I didn't hang onto this book for long because it's a series of quotes...I'm not impressed by these. And if they were really trying to impress me, I'd have liked some nice photography to illustrate the quote or something quality feeling. This book just didn't feel right."
5,"If you read only one book on screen writing, read this one","In real estate they discuss the three ""L's"" Location, location, location. This is the three ""W's"" Write, Write and Write more. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to write a screen play."
3,A lot of information,"This is a book to read and re-read. It is not a book that tells you how to write a screenplay in the way to format one. What you learn is writing tips from those who know. It's part don't give up, part dont do it for the money. They tell you to get on a writing routine even if you have a day/night job. I personally would not recommend this book until you've learned how to format a screenplay. Even then, only if you are truely vested in writing screenplays and couldn't see yourself doing anything else."
5,Fun book to read on Screenwriting -- Inspirational!,"I always love to read about how people work, and this is a great example of that type of book. It gives a number of a screenwriters who have written screenplays you will recognize, and they comment on how they work, what inspires them, how they think up new ideas, how they keep their creativity flowing, etc. It also tells you how discouraging screenwriting can be -- which is good to know up front, in case you may think you don't have the stomach for this endeavor.This would be a fun book to read even if you WEREN'T interested in becoming a screenwriter! I think much of what is in this book would be beneficial to novelists or playwrights as well."
5,"Motivating, Inspiring, Informative","This book was very helpful. As someone who currently has no ""mentor"" so to speak in the film industry, this book has acted as my temporary guide. It addresses many problems screenwriters go through, as well as warning people of the pitfalls that many aspiring screenwriters fall into. Highly recommended."
5,Masterful Performance,"BeethovenBernard HaitinkPiano Concerto No. 5 for Piano & Orchestra ""Emperor""Murray Perahia - Piano / KlavierThe Concertgebouw Orchestra(CBS Masterworks - DDD - 1987)While their performances of the 3rd and 4th were good, in this CD of the 5th piano concerto their performance is magnificent. This CD stands as one of the best.This is a Five Star CD"
5,"Unique, the most beautiful ""Emperor"" available","Sir Georg Solti chose this version for the film ""Immortal Beloved"". That's the best proof of its character.The timing (not too slow, not too fast) and the perfect synchronization with the orchestra make this version the most beautiful and perfect available."
2,Disappointed,"I love the watch. It looks like the picture. Unfortunately, the stem was broken although it was properly packaged."
3,Not Fresh,"I purchase Zen Puppy Peace Treats a few times a year. The last 2 times I purchased them, they were as hard as rocks. The experation date was good on the last 2 orders, and the experation date was also the same on the last 2 orders. Previously the treats were nice and soft. The seller has always been very speedy, and nicely priced. They just got a hold of a bad lot of treats."
2,Windfalls,"This company sent me a library copy of the book: Windfalls, from the Jacksonville Florida library. Nowhere on it was it marked ""discard"" which made me feel very creepy, like I had purchased a stolen library book! I plan to mail it to the library on the chance that it is indeed from there active collection. Condition was good."
1,Dynasty-style Christmas for everyone!,"Oh my goodness, what a dinosaur of a book. I kept checking the publication date because I just can't believe that this outdated, gaudy, overdone, and tacky book was truly published in 2004. It looks like something from 1984, when shoulderpads were wider than doors and glitz and glitter were in high demand.There is nothing remotely good about this book other than the fun it is to mock every page. If you're having a Dynasty-themed Christmas Day potluck, then this is the book for you, because the decorations would totally go as backdrops of those good old catfights on TV.If you think style is sold on QVC and the Home Shopping Network and the highlight of your life is calling in one of those shows so they put your call on TV, this is the book for you.What a piece of crap!"
4,fun stuff,"The first half of the book is pictures of the author's work. Each tree has a theme. Some are beautiful, others like the Southern Tree and the Wetern Tree are hideous. If you walk into a home and see a copy of their Cher tree, put your coat back on and run for your life.The second half is worth the price of the book. It tells you and shows you how to buy the best possible artificial tree, how to create a snow effect on the tree, how to actually make those gorgeous bows and how to arrange the garland. All the decorating tricks that you've admired on other people's trees are here."
1,Useless,"This is the most useless book that I have ever received as a gift. Completely agree with the reviewers that find this book scary and outdated. Most tree and ornament pictures are either plain weird (a pink fake tree with wolf masks on it?!) or pointless - most people already know how to put lights on a tree, or what kind of pet and child safety precautions are necessary.You could keep this book on your coffee table for Halloween, I suppose.The few pages that have pictures of decent normal ornaments will be used for a scrapbook, the rest will be donated to the fireplace."
5,charming stories of everyday grace,"These charming stories of everyday grace will warm your heart, stretch your mind, and nourish your soul. With admirable honesty and prayerful awareness, Mike Lyle draws from his experiences as a young minister to lead the reader deeper and deeper into the wonder and mystery of life with God. His eye for detail and his gift for storytelling enable the reader to travel with him as he ministers to his flock and shares his personal journey in a way that exposes the many and various ways life with God is intricately woven into the fabric of daily life--if only we have eyes to see. This inspiring collection is not only the perfect gift for seminarians and ministers, but also an excellent gift for those times when our doubts disturb us and we need a faithful voice whose lived experience can gently remind us of both the awesome and mundane reality of life with God."
3,Just okay,"I purchased this blender to make protein drinks, but it did okay, not the best for blending. It didn't crush the ice very well either. I guess for the price it was okay."
4,Teach Yourself Panjabi,"I like the book...However, when I opened it and started to read the information...I found out that there is a cassette tape that is supposed to be used with it.Unfortunately...Amazon does not sell the corresponding cassette tape. McGraw Hill only sells it as a complete set (Book & Tape)So, if I want the tape, I will have to buy another book."
3,Need to cover a blade?,"These leather knife blade covers work good as the leather provides great protection for the carver. Some carvers use wine corks but the blade edge isn't covered. With these covers, the blade is inserted into paper that is inside the sleeve,thus the tip and blade edge is protected. However the paper separates after a few insertions and slips off the blade easily while in your tool box/kit."
5,Thrilling performance,"I've loved classical music as since I was a child, but never listened to chamber music until this year. I have no expertise when it comes to analysis of this recording, but I've listened to it several times a day since downloading it and have been as thrilled by this performance of the Brahms G minor Quartet for Piano and Strings as I have ever been by any performance of a symphony, concerto, or opera."
2,The sister secret also called heartless pursuit,"I didn't like this book, because Belvia had to prove she was a virgin by having sex with Latham Tavenner.Latham was told a lie about Belvia and she added to the lie by saying she is going to meet her married lover.Belia's father wanted Latham to help his business with money, why he felt it necessery to tell Latham his daughter is having an affair with a married man, I am still puzzeled about.Latham was attracted to Belvia, so he make a play for Josy, Belvia's twin sister. Now that makes since.I like mostly all of Ms Steele's books, and I buy her books just because she is the writer.I also like Susan Fox, Rebecca Winters, Helen Brooks, Eva Rutland, the late Essie Summers, and the late Betty Neels."
5,I Loved It!,"I didn't think I was going to like it because I read the sequel first and even though I loved A Wife In Waiting I don't like series of books. Anway, I read it and I have never read anything better! That is my all time favorite book and read it over and over!"
2,Inacurate product description,"Purchased to share with the church I pastor, great material, but only 17 minutes worth of content. The rest of the DVD is advertising for ""That the World May Know"" with Ray Vander Laan. That is a great series, but this DVD is just a ""teaser"" and then promotional material. Save your money and buy one (or all) of the updated Vander Laan series now titled ""Faith Lessons"""
5,Sheer perfection,"As a lover of Tchaikovsky's symphonies, I would recommend this boxed (3 CD's) set of the 4th, 5th and 6th compositions to anyone who also loves this great composer. It is a fine recording by a great orchestra."
1,Tuff Drums,The Drums was better that I can find in any parts store for the same price after 6 months one Drum went bad with bad rust and make the car make little jump to stop. I hope that the vender will exchange it.
2,Walk a mile in these SHOES!,There very very very painful and uncomfortable! A solider couldn't wear these in combat...and I've been told that I'm a solider...I beg to differ after wearing these shoes!!!
5,Captivating,"This book is based on real crime in Blairsville, GA. Super well written and so good that I couldn't put it down till I was finished."
5,"Men, do not fear the Jicky","Guys,Jicky wasn't originally sold as a women's fragrance.That's right - it's a unisex. And frankly, it's great as a fresh alternative to the bland acquatic-citrus-woody sports fragrances we're sold by the ton. Lavender, vanilla, a touch of citrus and spice and musk/civet, smell great on both men and women, in slightly different ways.So hey, manly men, pay no attention to the marketing. Give Jicky a try, and your lady may well want to share. Or, sneak a little of hers for a day in the office."
3,Jicky edT!,"Remember, this is Not edp, it's edT! This is Very glaring & overwhelming, unlike the edp. Love the edp, do not care for the edt at all!"
5,Great Network Cable,"Its a good network cable for the price, I went to a few local stores before I bought this cable and most didn't have 30ft cat5e cables they had either 25ft or 50ft and they wanted about five times more than this particular cable cost. I payed around $8 for this cable you would have to look hard to find a quality cable for a better price."
5,30ft Ethernet cable,"Bought this cable to place between two rooms for connecting a tv to a computer .The cable is suppose to be non-snag, but i covered the ends with tape to make it easier to go through the walls.There were no problems with installation and it's purpose."
1,Not my cup of tea.,"If homosexuality is your cup of tea then you might not mind this story. I was hoping it wasn't going in that direction, but I was afraid it was and it did. I'm always on the lookout for clean Agatha Christie type mystery stories, unfortunately this wasn't one."
4,Rampal . the man of the golden flute!,"Nobody (in their right mind) can not deny that these recordings are splendid. And formidably executed. However, one feels that the team Rose Stern and Schneider gives a candor, lyrical flow and specific gravity absolutely inimitable.For those who do not know this other set, they may be somewhat exaggerated this statement. However, the magnificent virtuoso Jean Pierre Rampal dwarfs other available versions in the market.So my advice would be to buy both sets and you dear reader, set for himself the differences in design and performance.Be sure to acquire this historic set."
2,"Nice, but...","...the Rampal/Stern/Schneider/Rose recording is much better. Look for it and purchase it instead. It's an analog recording, but that's fine."
2,Don't you know how to add?,"This is one of the first books i read about hanson... the pictures are ok but what really made me mad was the author kept saying that Taylor Hanson was 13 the time the album was released but states that his birthday was march 14, 1983(which is true)but he can't possibly be 13 if the album was released in may of 1997... I mean how can you write a book and publish it, without checking and making sure that your doing you math correctly? I mean that is just careless.That is something you as a hanson fan do not need some one being careless about a band you love.michelle"
3,prompt delievery,"I was expecting six 100 count boxes. But I was delivered twelve boxes. I had storage for six boxes, not twelve. That was not what they sold. It would be nice to get what you bought. I can use them, but it is not what I bought."
5,(just about) Everything you need to know about Easter Island,"This guide is absolutely fabulous, whether you want to plan a trip to Easter Island (in the South Pacific, about 7 to 8 hours flight from Santiago, Chile) or just want to read about this exotic and remote island. I found the Guide fascinating and extremely helpful about all aspects regarding Easter Island, including where to stay, what historic sites to visit, and the eclectic history regarding Rapa Nui (as it's Polynesian name is known). A lot of thought and detail has been put into this hearty book. If Easter Island is on your mind, I recommend this book whole heartily."
5,Marvelous guide on Easter island,"Together with Lonely Planets(LP) guide on Chile/Easter Island, this guide basically tells what you need to know about the island. (Reading Thor Heyerdahl books will of course be usefull supplements to these 2 books).Very good description on the historical facts (not very up-dated on Thor Heyerdahls writings: the birdman and the DNA issue) and an extensive guide to the different sites on the island.The coverage (about 20 pages) of the different hotels, car rentals etc. under ""practical matters"" is a bit useless. The book does not tell anything about how good/bad the different hotels, car rentals are. The LP guide is much better on this.Have a very enjoyable reading."
1,Not recommended,I can not understand why anyone could be helped by this book. Most of the texts are an expression about how the author have problems with the results of the Heyerdahl expedition and researches . While not being an archaeologist himself Laughlin make statements what is the right thing of history and about all archaeological remains - absolutely questionable why anyone should read this. The counting of archaeological sites is without concern to the areas of the island - one have to investigate these on a map with tremendous work.One big part of the book is due to the Island's language. What kind of traveller is learning Rapa nui? That is my question to the author.Forget this book.
4,"great light, but recomend Delux Kit","I got this light in a Delux Kit that came with the light (duh!), 2 replacement bulbs, and an AC adapter for only seventeen bucks and change, less than buying it all separately. This really is a great little light. It's not too bright and is super light weight so it can be easily used on mass market paperbacks or even magazines. It takes 4 AA batteries or you can use the adapter which I do all the time. I found that you get the best lighting angle when you clip it onto the upper right-hand corner at an angle pointing toward the lower left-hand corner. Compared to other book lights, I think this one is much more economical. I only gave it 4 stars because I would recomend getting it from your local book store in the kit instead of paying the extra bucks for shipping."
2,Odorless?!,"Excuse me,...but this product is so far from being odorless. At first, it was (maybe a little less than a month), odorless then after that,...there was nothing to get rid of the scent. I even bought some odor discs but they didn't work either. The only convenient thing about this is that you can put whatever garbage bag you want in it and even then, the bag can hold many diapers."
1,"""Waste"" of money","The only quality this pail lives up to is it does hold the diaper. As far as containing the smell, you might as well throw it on the floor. The ""odor Trap"" door's tension is too great for newborn diapers and you have to push them thru manually. PLEASE do not waste your money on this one. You will end up spending more money to replace it with a better one."
1,NOT ODOR-LESS!,"Yet another awful Safety First product.I quit using it after 2-3 months. I tried using fabric softner sheets in it, spraying it with Lysol... everything and it stunk to high heaven.Save your money and avoid this pail.Now I simple put poopy diapers in a plastic shopping bag, tie it up and take it outside to the big trash can. Much easier and much cleaner!"
2,something stinks!!,"We were very disappointed in our ""Odorless"" diaper pail. After a few weeks we noticed that it didn't contain the odor as much as we thought it would. Inside the lid there is a little disc that is supposed to help by emitting a more pleasant odor. It worked for a short time, but I quickly realized that we would need more than the 1 that was supplied in our original purchase. I tried several times to contact the 1-800 number included in the instruction sheet, but was unable to reach a customer service rep. So, I went on-line. I found Saftety 1st's website and sent them a letter asking where I could purchase more. After more than 6 weeks and countless emails back and forth, I have yet to receive my discs. Considering that I placed an official order 4 1/2 weeks ago, I am very upset. I have decided to get rid of this diaper pail and buy something new. I suggest spending a little more and buying something from a company who's customer service department actually services customers."
1,very diappointed,The top will not stay shut I have only had it 4 weeks. And it isnot orderless either. I am really disappointed. I see way it is discontinued.Karen
3,A good product for the money,"I purchased this pail because I wanted a pail that used trash bags. I figured that it would not be 100% odor free, so I was not disappointed when it turned out to not be. I like that it uses trash bags so I don't have to buy special liners. The pail is priced right for what you get. The one thing I was disappointed about was that it does not seem to hold very many diapers so you have to change it often, but that is probably a good thing. Overall I don't think this is a bad product to buy as long as you change the bag a few times a week."
1,Lid does NOT shut!,"I was NOT satisfied with this product at all. I was originally drawn to it because you did not have to buy special refill bags, however. Once I got it home I realized that the lid does not even latch shut. You can close it, but the only way to open it is to hit the top and it pops open. Sometimes if you just walk by it will pop open. NOT childproof and NOT odor free since the lid will not stay shut!"
2,HELP I NEED A NEW PAIL,"I REGESTERED FOR THIS DAIPER PAIL. I LIKED IT AT FIRST THEN THE SPRINGS ON THE INSIDE BROKE SO WE FIXED THEM, EVERYTIME WE CHANGED THE BAG. THEN THE INSIDES FELL APART, SO WE FIXED THE INSIDE THE BEST WE COULD. THEN WE PUT STICK-UPS INSIDE TO HELP THE ODOR. FINALLY THE ODOR INSERT BROKE THE THE PAIL IS GONE. I AM ONLINE LOOKING AT NEW PAILS BEFORE I DRIVE TO THE STORE FOR OUR NEWEST BABY EXPENSE.... HOPEFULLY IT IS NOT A WATSE OF MONEY....."
2,Let me know when they fix the springs,"We liked the idea of using standard trash bags. However the spring loaded plastic ramps used to seal the bags came loose too often to bother fixing. Also, the latch that keeps the lid close has broke... letting our 18 month old put toys in the diaper pail. It's no longer kept it in her room."
2,Not worth buying,"I originally registered for this diaper pail because it only requires regular trash bags and I thought it would be both easier and less costly than the ones which require special bags. However, I found that the round ball that is supposed to block in odors kept falling off. It actually fell off into the bag with the diapers and was thrown out one day before we knew it was missing. After that, the pail was useless as it no longer blocked odors. I also found that the lid always closed on my hands whenever I was changing the bag. Needless to say, I now have a different diaper pail."
5,great for cloth diapers,this bin is great for cloth diapers. we love ours. keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two's worth of diapers-- which is all i need because we wash every other day. Our local Babies R Us sells replacement deodisks (or you can buy them online from cloth diaper vendors) when the one that comes with it loses it's smell so that you can maintain freshness. It's easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive.
4,Working great but it's only been 2 months,We have this product in our bedroom not too far from the bed ( as this is where most of the diapers are changed.) I have not had any problems with odor at all when the lid is closed but it is starting to stink a little when changing the bag. So now I am interested in finding a replacement odor absorbing chip but have not had any luck. I am still very pleased with this product and would definately recommend it so far - with our first daughter we used another pail ( hint it needed special replacement bags )and it smelled from day one. By the way our second daughter is bottle fed and her soiled diapers could clear a room...
1,Not the best choice,"My husband and I picked out this diaper pail when I was pregnant with my son because friends told us to get one that uses regular garbage bags. That turned out to be the only perk of this diaper pail. The springs have been popping off since about the first month. My son is now 10 months old and recently one of the springs broke, which completely gets rid of the supposed ""odor-free"" feature (which I found wasn't exactly true either). Now that we are expecting baby #2 I am going to have to buy another diaper pail to replace this one. My advice: Don't waste your money. It's just as efficient to throw your diapers in a regular trash can."
2,I hate this Diaper Pail,"I thought it would work great, I hated the Daiper Genie and with 2 kids in diapers I need something to stop orders. This just dosent work. I have to change the bag daily to keep smells out. I wil defently be getting rid of this one and getting a diffrent one."
4,We use it with cloth diapers,"I have been using this pail with cloth diapers for some time now, I also use a cloth liner and that works well with this pail. I did however remove the plastic flaps from the inside of the pail as they were just in the way and with out them there is more room for diapers. It never really stinks unless the diapers need to be washed any how. The only complaint I have is that it should be bigger."
1,Too Stinky,"We had this diaper pail for our first child. We loved the idea of using regular garbage bags to save money. Unfortunately, there was nothing odor-less about this diaper pail. With our new baby, we will spend the extra money to get a better quality, truly odorless pail, even if it means we have to buy special bags."
3,A couple of frustrations and a refill idea.,"After using the Diaper Genie for two years I was excited to find a new product that didn't require the pricey refills. I decided to try the Safety 1st Diaper Pail, which uses standard 13 gallon trash bags. It holds about the same amount of dirty diapers as the Genie, but has a couple of downfalls in my mind. The opening that you push the diapers through eventually does not close all the way, so the next time you open the pail, the odor is so strong. On our pail, the button you push to open the lid is very hard to depress and takes a few pushes before it will finally open. The fragrance refills are hard to find, but I have found that some of the inexpensive stick-on or disk air fresheners you can purchase at the grocery store, fit inside the cup just fine. I feel that this is a decent product for the low price."
4,A good bargain,"My husband and I find this diaper pail to be very convenient. It holds about a weeks worth of diapers and really minimizes the smell. The kitty litter box has more odor than this pail. I decided on this pail rather than the diaper genie since it uses standard trash bags - much easier and cheaper to get a box of those than a refill for the genie. Only issue I have had with this pail is the lid sometimes pops open, but it is easily closed."
1,Odor-Less Diaper Pail-Safety First,"My husband and I bought this because, as new parents, we wanted to save money on baby equipment. As many of the other reviews have stated, the low price and the fact that you can use regular trash bags in this is a big draw. Please, do not get sucked into getting this pail. In fact, if you really want to save money, don't get a diaper pail at all. Manufacturers of baby products make you think you need diaper pails, just as they make you think you need changing tables and diaper wipe warmers! Use a plain plastic grocery bag, hang it on the door knob to your baby's room, and put diapers in it. When it gets full(or too stinky!), simply take it to the big garbage can outside. This diaper pail made my son's room smell horrible. As soon as I went to go upstairs, I could smell the stink coming from his room. I sprayed the pail with Lysol almost every day and washed it in hot, soapy water weekly, and it still didn't help. Save your money!!"
1,Only good for the first year,"I've had the same problems with this diaper pail. The springs constantly pop off, the lid opens too easily, and once my daughter started solid foods the smell was unbearable. The whole upstairs smelled like diapers. It seems like such a savings because it's less expensive than other diaper pails and you can use regular trash bags, but when you consider that you will have to buy a whole new system it's a waste of money!"
1,WHEW!!!!!!!! BEWARE..........,"Within a month of using this pail, the lid kept popping open. The reason that I purchased this pail was that I liked the idea of not having to buy refills and could use regular kitchen bags. Now that my son is eating solids the stinch coming from this diaper pail is terrible! I decided yesterday that I was tossing this pail and going with the 'Diaper Genie', which I have heard mixed reviews on but anything beats this pail. I realize that all diaper pails are going to smell a little--look what goes in them! However, this pail should be taken off the market."

2,not sturdy or odorless,"My husband and I wanted something cheap and uncomplicated, so we registered for this product. Within the first month, one of the springs on the diaper drop broke and, subsequently, became not odorless."
1,Sucks! Doesnt Work,"I got this hopeing it would work, it worked for 2 days and then it would not keep the stink in. Its not worth it at all. I say the diaper Genie works better then this one."
2,Great if you like the stink,"At first I really liked this pail. It was alot cheaper than all the other ones out there and I didn't have to buy the expensive refills for it I could just use regular trash bags. I was loving it until... after about 8 months of using it and the stinky diapers getting bigger, the smell in my son's room was unbearable. We had to constantly replace the little odor eater in the top with little effect on the odor control. I am pregnant now with my second child and will be purchasing something different, maybe the Diaper Dekor. It's gotten good revues."
2,"ok for cloth, but forget about &quot;odor-less&quot;","I was given this pail when my third child came along. I had used a diaper genie with my first 2 but had desided to cloth diaper my third, that ment no more diaper genie. (thats ok, it was too much hassle any way, but thats another review)To make this pail work for me, I first pulled out the flaps under the lid, the ones ment to hold in odor, those are useless. Then I got an industrial strength deo disk to keep the odors away. If I am not careful when I empty the pail I end up dumping the disk and the dome cover into the washing machine(fishing them out of that laundry is not pretty). This is not a toddler proof pail by any means! It is better than the trash can, but only by a little.Some good parts are: a place to put a deo disk, the easy pop up lid and a fair amount of room for a few days worth of diapers.Good Luck!"
5,Excellent Product!,I have had this diaper pail since my daughter was first born (she is now 3 yrs old) and I love it! I have used this diaper pail from the time she was born and just stopped using it recently. My daughter was a late potty trainer and being that she is 3 she had some really stinky diapers. This diaper pail kept our home smelling fresh even with a 3 year old's dirty diaper in there. I would definitely recommend it and I rate it 5 stars!
1,Yes inexpensive but does not work!,If you want a diaper pail that does not stink spend the extra money and buy a diaper Genie. I bought this one when my first was born because it was cheaper I tried all kinds of bags and no matter what it still stinks I threw this one out( I felt bad trying to sell it to someone at a yard sale) and bought a diaper genie which I still have and have had for four years now. Trust me spend the extra money.
1,"If the top stayed shut, maybe it would be oderless",The top does not stay shut on the daiper pail so any and all oders do come out. Since we're still on breast milk this is not too bad yet but I'm told that once we start on solids the oders get worse. The only good thing about this diaper pail is that you can use tall kitchen garbage bags instead of expensive daiper pail bags.
1,Odorless - don't think so. . .,"This diaper pail remained odorless for approximately two months. After nine weeks of use, the smell is so overwhelming that I am in the process of purchasing a new pail. I do not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Stinky Pail!,"Well, after reading all the reviews on this pail I just had to pick it for my registry because I had heard horror stories about the diaper genie. To my disappointment it was nothing it was made out to be. While it is very convienent because it uses regular kitchen trash bags, it just doesn't hold in the oder! When you open the top to put a diaper in you get a not so nice wiff of dirty diapers! There is nothing to hold the oder in, there are openings on the side of the flaps that you are supposed to push the diaper through so I'm kinda missing the point. I've also found that I can get smells from it when it's closed if you have a couple stinky diapers in it. I usually end up having to empty it before it's full because of the smell. I definetly DON'T recommend this diaper pail."
2,Stinky!,"This pail stinks up the whole room! Do not buy it. The only thing good about it is that it holds a lot of diapers. The old saying, &quot;You get what you pay for&quot; is definitely true for this one. You would be MUCH better off with the Diaper Champ, which costs about $30. My sister has this one. It seals the smell in really good. You just set the diaper in a hole, grab a handle and move it front or back. The odor does not even have a chance to seep out. You can use garbage bags with it and don't have to pay for the costly refill bags like you do with the Diaper Genie. I'm going to switch over to this one!"
4,Works for me,"My child is now 20 months and we have two. I'm pleased with them both, one downstairs and one up. When your child is younger you need to empty it regularly. When you child is older it's best to empty what you can in the toliet. When you put the stinky stuff in the toliet and the diaper in the pail, it will not smell. Anything too messy for the toliet goes in a plastic bag and outside."
3,The Not So Odor-Less Diaper Pail,I have been using this diaper pail for 6 months now. At first I loved it. Not any more. The slot where you put the diaper through now stays open which allows all of the odor to come get out. Even though I empty it twice a week an use scented garbage bags it still doesn't help much with the odor. It is easy to open with one hand which is a big plus.
2,This is NOT Odorless!,"After about 2 months, the scented disc wore off. I haven't replaced it, but have a feeling it won't help much. Don't put poop diapers in this because it will stink! It is convenient and lightweight, plus it takes regular garbage bags, which is a plus. It's ok for pee diapers, but I don't use it for poop diapers anymore!!!"
2,Been there - done that - not worth it!,"I'm a mother of 4 boys who were and are reluctant potty trainers, so trust me when I tell you I have changed more than my share of diapers. This was our third diaper pail and I am disgusted with it. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that it does do an ok job of containing the odors - but as for durability, it is not worth the plastic it is made from. I loved the design at first - it has spring hinges that hold the inner barrier closed, that is until they start popping out of their respective locations. Every time I changed the bag (which is usually twice a week) I have to snap the springs and the barriers back into place and now after several months, they are no longer snapping into place. Unfortunately when I replaced our last two pails (one of which was a diaper genie - another waste of time and money), I bought two of these pails - A BIG MISTAKE on my part. Please learn from my mistake and don't buy this diaper pail."
3,"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em!","Yes, my spring broke as well... but looking on the brighter side: when my son is old enough to walk he won't be able to accidently press the spring button to release the pail cover... it's kind of an unexpected safety feature! And yes, you can still open it with one hand... your fingers are not glued to one another. Really, diapers will stink no matter what pail you use.... The covered pail is cheap and doesn't require buying refill bags (especially since we use cloth diapers)."
1,Not good for cloth diapers,"I have 2 sons in cloth diapers. I went to Meijer to find a diaper pail and only had 3 choices. This was the only one that used regular bags. I used it for 2 days and the lid wouldn't stay shut. Also, it doesn't push cloth diapers through to the bottom. I had to use my hand to push them down. Yuck! It is also small and won't hold very many diapers. I generally wash diapers every 2-3 days and this pail won't hold that many diapers. What happened to the good old fashion tall diaper pails without all of the contraptions?"
1,Odor-Less only if it's empty,"This diaper pail is awful! The only way it would stay odor-less is if you never put any diapers in it. Yes, it takes regular trash bags, but it doesn't seem to hold as much as the Fisher Price diaper pail (which is apparently no longer available anywhere). Don't waste your money."
1,Terrible! Would Never Recomend!,"This diaper pail should be pulled off the shelves! I have to contend with ""2"" of these stink trappers! I was so dissapointed at how they do not cover the odor. Sure they take trash bags, but it's a real task to change because the lid never stays open.I'm on the hunt for a better diaper pail, anyone have any suggestions???Until then I'll keep the ""clothespins"" nearby :-)"
3,You get what you pay for,"This pail is serving us well, but it does not live up to its name. ODORLESS IT IS NOT!! Also, one of the inside pieces on ours broke off, but luckily it did not interfere with the pail being useful. I like the fact that we don't have to purchase special bags (major plus), but since ours does not compact the diaper at all, we are constantly having to change the bag. It's certainly not the best diaper pal on the market, but it can serve your purpose. I guess you get what you pay for. Good luck."
1,Day-Care No-No,"I work at a daycare and we use the ""oderless"" diaper pail. First of all, we empty the pail every night and it still smells awful. And when you're holding a baby in one arm and a diaper in the other hand, it's hard to press the ""childsafe"" button which lifts the lid. Also, the older toddlers are easily able to open the pail...it's not so child-safe. I would not recommend this for anyone!! I'm pregnant and due in December...we're going with the Diaper Dekor."
4,Convenient and user friendly,"This pail is an extremely good bargain for its price and requires minimal future expense as it uses regular garbage bags instead of custom bags like the ""Diaper Genie""."
3,Not bad for the price,I decided to get this over the Diaper Genie because it takes regular trash bags and not the expensive liners. My breastfed baby really didn't start to get stinky diapers until solids were introduced. The pail could start to smell but I started buying the absolutely cheapest sealable sandwich baggies and would put a poopie diaper in that before putting it in the pail. Works great at keeping odors away and is still cheap. It does have a few drawbacks but I'm not complaining. Works fine for me.
4,Works great if you change it once in a while,"I love this diaper pail. Some of the reviews I've read complain of odor or broken springs....well, you have to change it once in a while. I imagine if it's overstuffed the springs will break; and if a dirty diaper sits in there for a few days it's bound to stink. I have had no problems with this pail. I change it about twice a week, which is as easy as changing the kitchen wastebasket; and all I need is a 99-cent box of regular garbage bags, not some special overpriced cartridge."
1,GROSS--WHATS THAT SMELL,"OK, ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, THE PALE IS COVERED AND BABY CAN NOT GET INTO IT. IT TAKES REGULAR TRASH BAGS AND THAT IS NICE TOO. I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHO DID THE ORIGINAL TESTING FOR THIS PRODUCT BEFORE HITTING THE MARKET. I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE WOULD CALL THIS THING ODOR FREE. WE HAD TO DUMP IT 1 OR 2 TIMES A DAY TO KEEP THE ODOR DOWN. BY THAT POINT I DON'T EVEN SEE THE SENSE IN HAVING IT, WHY NOT JUST TAKE ALL THE DIAPERS OUTSIDE? WE HAD TO WASH IT DOWN WITH THE WATER HOSE AND DISH SOAP, THEN LEAVE IT OUTSIDE FOR 2 DAYS TO GET THE SMELL OUT. DURING THAT TIME WE SAVED OUR PLASTIC GROCERY BAGS, WRAPPED THE DIRTY AND SOILED DIAPERS IN THE PLASTIC BAG AND TOOK THEM OUTSIDE TO THE TRASH. THAT WAS THE BEST WAY TO KEEP THE SMELL OUT. MAYBE MY SONS POOP SMELLS WORST THAN OTHER BABIES, I DON'T KNOW. WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT IF YOU WANT THIS PRODUCT SAVE YOUR MONEY....YOU CAN HAVE MINE."
1,pop up pail,I have had this diaper pail for 3 months since i had my daughter and i have found that i dont't really like it because the lid always pops up and stays open so i have to lay something on it to keep it shut. Also when it pops up it always wakes the baby and us if were asleep. It also doesnt hold the smell and gets full faster than other pails.
2,Not good!,We registered for this before the birth of our now 20 month old child....it is awful. We have had to change the bags sometimes twice a day to keep the odor out of the house. We even have dumped dirty diaper contents in the toilet and then threw out the diaper still to have the odor escape. ...
4,What were you thinking?,"I agree with the reviewer who stated quite simply that this is just a diaper pail not magic. We first used a Diaper Genie and hated it. The refills are exorbitant, the twisting ring is a joke and began to tear the expensive odor locking bags. So, we ventured out and bought this pail without reading any reviews or anything. We love it. It takes regular garbage bags, cutting the expense. We do have to change the bag out one or two times a week but have not experienced the odor problem so others have. Stinky poop is stinky no matter what you do with it. The Diaper Genie did not handle it any better than this pail does."
2,I agree with the other reviews,"I agree with the other reviews that this works well in the begninning when diapers arent that stinky and the odor chip still works. I purchased it mainly because it used regular garbage bags(which it defintely one of it's best features.) It lasted us probably a year but slowly the springs started popping off and it was less and less effective. By the time my son was two, and potty trained it was VERY stinky! I am trying the diaper geanie with my next child."
2,Works fine.... for a little while,"My husband and I bought this diaper pail after receiving a Diaper Genie that was broken. We didnt want to buy another one, because at the time we were VERY tight on money... so we downsized. This pail worked fine at first. The first 3 months it was great (my husband liked it more than I did however). I could never figure out how to get the spin lid to work right, and the springs kept popping out of the hinges. SO AGGREVATING when you have an infant screaming to be picked up! So, after 7 1/2 months we gave in and gave up on this diaper pail. You get what you payfor, and I would spend the extra dollars if I had known then what I know now... DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOU LIKE SPENDING TWICE AS MUCH FINDING OUT FOR YOURSELF..."
2,"Flimsy, ineffective - buy the Diaper Genie","Bought this hoping to save $ on refills. Twisting mechanism doesn't really work, spring that keeps mouth closed keeps popping off. And once our baby started solid food, the gig was up - doesn't contain the odor of truly stinky diapers. Just upgraded to the Diaper Genie (which now has extra-thick bags for babies on solid food)."
4,works better if you use larger bags,"This diaper pail worked pretty well for me while i was living in an apartment. took a few mins to figure out how to put the bags in, but after that the only problem was with the inner claw not closing when it got close to full. I started using larger sized bags which made it to where the diapers would sit at the bottom rather than putting pressure on the opening and this helped.. i put stinky diapers in this and wet ones in a regular trash can so i wouldn't have to change the bag as often. now that we're living in a house again, and i rarely have to change a diaper in the middle of the night(not to mention her diapers are a LOT stinkier now), i just take the dirty diapers straight outside to the big garbage can once or twice a day."
2,Broken Spring,"I didn't give this pail 1 star because it does keep the stink out, and it does take standard garbage bags.After a few months of use, the spring assembly on the blue cover popped off. I assembled it back together, and within a few days, the spring broke in half. I tried to get another spring by calling Safety First. They only had the blue top without the spring. The guy said I'd just have to buy another pail if I wanted a working pop top."
2,Unhappy Customer,"This diaper pail is certainly the worst I have used. It works ok for about a week and by the end of that first week I was ready to get a new diaper pail. It does not keep oders in much at all, and I don't even put poopy diapers in it. After about a week the springs started constantly falling off of the thing inside that supposedly keeps the bag closed and the oder out so it doesn't do any good. Yes, a plus is the using regular bags, but so does the Diaper Champ and it also keeps oders in much better than this. I'm definitely going back to the Diaper Champ; I only bought this one because it was the only one at my store, now I know it was worth the wait for the Diaper Champ in the mail."
2,Not exactly ODORLESS!,"My husband and I bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills. Well, it did not control odor. The plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week. The odor escaped even when the pail was closed. You do save money on refills at first. But when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows, you have to change the bag more often. I used A LOT of baking soda and Lysol spray to help control the stink.Also, the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily, and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things.I would not recommend this product."
4,Works well with adult briefs too,"Purchased this unit to hold adult size large briefs and have been pleasantly surprised. Holds approximately 8 soiled briefs with virtually no smell emitted (except when adding more to pail). I wish it held more but I'm so happy to have something that helps with this ""unmentionable"" problem that I really am not concerned by the small-ish volume. I'm having trouble finding replacement deodorizer disks though and may have to use a stick-on unit or something when a new one is required."
2,OKAY diaper pail,"This is an OKAY diaper pail for the money. It doesn't TOTALLY eliminate the smell and the bags are hard to change. I don't even try any more to 'twist' the bag, I just take the lid off. It is very easy to open and I wonder about my son getting in it as he gets older. If this is all you can afford, it's not that bad."
3,it's ok,"I've been using this pail for 2 months with my breastfed baby. It contains all of the odor from his moderatly stinky diapers. It doesn't work exactly like it's supposed to, the blue dome is supposed to push the diaper into the pail but the diaper usually gets stuck and I have to push it through but that's no big deal. When I'm changing the garbage bag the lid won't stay open and it falls hitting my hands, it's really annoying."
2,Poor quality!,"I too originally registered for this brand diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags instead of special, costly bags. Also it claimed to be odor-free. The first pail I got I had to return to the store before I even used it since the ""latch"" would not stay locked, or even closed. The next one I got just broke--after four months of use. First, one of the inside springs came off and then half of the inside ""bag closer"" flaps has completely fallen off.....meaning the bag is not held closed any longer. The deodorizing disk did not last long either, and the Sassy refills I bought at a baby store did not work at all......Likewise, I too noticed that you can only get use of half the garbage bag as the pail itself is not tall enough....I am trying to track down cost and location for another pail called Diaper Wizard which claims to also accept regular garbage bags....and opens and closes by itself with some kind of motion detector........"
2,IS THERE ANY REFILLS FOR THE DEODERIZER?!?,"FROM THE TIME WE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT IT HAS BEEN A PAIN? THE LID DOES NOT STAY SHUT. IT IS DEFINITELY NOT CHILD PROOF, MY SON HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET INTO IT SINCE HE WAS 6 MOS OLD. IT STINKS, IT NEEDS TO BE TALLER BECAUSE YOU WASTE HALF A GARBAGE BAG. IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO GET A REFILL ON THE DEODERIZER PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!!!!! IF THERE ISN'T ONE THERE SHOULD BE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Broke on the first trial run!,"I read online reviews of this diaper pail and decided to take a chance. I do home daycare and was getting overwhelmed by the odor from my rubbermaid!! I was very disappointed when I brought this home, opened the box, and got it ready to go only to find that the lid would not stay shut. My husband looked at it when he came home and the lid WOULD stay shut. The next time we'd try it, no luck. What a waste of time and energy. I would recommend that you try a different product."
1,Utterly Worthless,"It doesn't keep in odors at all. The spring in the lid broke and fell off within the first month. It is difficult to twist and remove the bag, especially when very full. The lid pops open by itself sometimes. It makes a godawful racket every time you pop open the lid because the ineffectual deodorant chip inside rattles around.Really, how much worse could this product be? It just stinks, in every sense of the word. Buy anything else -- a plain old kitchen garbage pail would be sturdier, cheaper, quieter, easier to use, and no more smelly than this."
1,Odor-more diaper pail,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS ""ODOR-LESS DIAPER PAIL!"" (. . .) The pail worked for about a month. Then the slot where the diapers are thrown wouldnt close all the way so the smell kept escaping. And it was indeed a struggle to get the trash bags to fit (. . .)."
2,not odor less,"At first this pail worked just fine for us.We didn't have a problem with her room smelling bad till now. My daughter is 10 months old, and eating solids and table food which makes the diaper smell real bad. So I will go out and get a new kind of pail(Diaper Champ).It was nice using your trash bags, But I wouldn't buy this one, because you will just have to replace when your child gets older and the diapers get worst."
2,Oops! I bought it 3 months ago,"We chose this one against the Diaper Genie to avoid the recurring costs of the Genie refills.But we are not at all pleased!.Though it takes good number of diapers, and till now I do not have the problem of odors too, the spring breaks over and over again.And my biggest problem is the struggle to replace the cover(trash bag) into it.The lid keeps on falling back and since the pail is tall and narrow at the bottom it too keeps on falling a dozen times.Wish I had known this babies'r'us site before and read all your reviews before purchasing it."
1,Waste of money!,"This has got to be one of the worst cases of false advertising I've ever encountered. To call this pail ""oder-less"" is a joke. The only way that I have found to keep it from not stinking as much is to put everyone of my daughter's diapers in a scented diaper bag,tie it up, and then put it in the pail. And don't even think about putting a really poopy diaper in it. I've learned to to take those straight to the garbage outside. Aside from all that, the garbage bags are almost impossible to put in and the flip top lid likes to flip open by it's self. More trouble than it's worth when you have a newborn to take care of. Save your money and buy a diaper genie."
4,Easy..pretty odor-less,"I was using the diaper genie and I wasn't at all impressed. I was at a shop needing to pick up Genie refills and saw this pail on sale for $14. I bought it. From day one I loved it I threw out the genie and I won't go back.It only got 4 stars because you do need to buy fresh disks every so often. They are nice because when you open the pail you smell a fresh clean sent. Also I feel the pail could be taller, when I change the kitchen bag (which is the only time you really smell the foul diapers) my bag was only about 3/4 the way full.But other than that its a great investment, no smelly nursery and no dang refills to buy!"
1,Not a good diaper pail...you get what you pay for,"At first, I bought this diaper pail thinking it was an innovative contraption with the ease of using regular trash bags and the easy pop-open top and all you have to do is twist the top and the bag closes up to hide the stink of the nasty diapers inside. Well, we lost springs and the plastic part inside the pail came apart very soon after we bought it. Too bad it was too late to take it back. It really doesn't hide the smells that emminate from it. This is a [poorly made] diaper pail and I do not recommend it at all.I ended up getting a ""Diaper Champ"" pail at my 2nd baby's shower and I like it a lot more. There's nothing that falls apart at all, and you can use regular trash bags for it too. You can smell it after about a week, and by then it's time to change the bag anyway."
1,Not worth the money,"We received this diaper pail as a shower gift and have been using it for 5 months now. I had originally considered exchanging it for a diaper genie, but decided to give it a try since I could use my own garbage bags instead of having the expense of those refills. I really wish I had made the exchange. For the first couple of months it worked great. However, it has really begun to smell even when it barely has any diapers in it. My daughter's whole room smells and our entire upstairs is beginning to smell. Yuck! It also began to fall apart after the first couple of months. The springs on the inside continue to pop out and the flaps that close the diapers off keep falling out. I would not suggest buying this diaper pail."
1,Odor-FULL Diaper Pail,"This diaper pail definitely does not live up to its' name! This pail will smell with even one dirty diaper in it. We have been throwing our soiled diapers in our regular trash instead... it smells less there. The deodorant tablet is held in place by a cup that kept falling into the pail until we finally just took it out completely. Our 1 year old son has no problem opening the ""child resistant"" closure. The lid doesn't always stay closed... it often pops open a few seconds after you close the lid. All in all... we are definitely getting a new pail before our second child is born and we have even more diapers."
2,Stinky,"We bought this pail for wet diapers while we used our diaper genie for messy diapers (we were trying to cut down on buying diaper genie refills). Well, this pail has not done very well in odor control and is only slighly better that a trashcan with a lid. I was very disappointed and am considering using the diaper genie for everything."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This diaper pail stank worse than the diapers it was holding! In less than a month, the blue dome on the inside of the lid that held the odor disk had fallen off (into a bag of dirty diapers. Needless to say, we didn't retrieve it!) The lid was very hard to open at first, we had to pound on the button to get it to release. And the springs kept popping off the insert. We finally got so tired of using the stupid thing that we tossed it after less than six weeks!"
1,useless diaper pail,"Very dissapointed. It is great that you can use standard garbage bags, but you can only get 10 or so diapers in it. The ""odor-less"" part of it is a joke. Newborn diapers wont even go down into the bag, you end up pushing them down(gross!!). THe ""twist and seal"" part dosent work either, it just pulls the bag down. Spend the money and get a better one."
4,You need this pail,"I bought this diaper pail after trying the diaper genie- and I love this pail. It does not take up much room(the diaper champ looked huge), it is relatively odorless (except when the pail is very full or when you are changing the bag) and was the cheapest pail I found. Because it uses kitchen trash bags, you don't have to keep buying refills that get expensive and can be tricky to buy the right one(like the diaper genie). It is a little tricky putting the bags in at first, but you get the hang of it pretty quickly. I use the drawstring trashbags, and it is so easy to remove the bag, tie it up and haul it out. The deodorizer compartment appears big enough to accomodate most deodorizers, but I like the ones from Sassy. My favorite thing is that you can use it with one hand- great in the middle of the night."
1,Not odor-less! Get your money back.,"I originally registered for this then read reviews and changed to the diaper champ. However, when I did not receive a diaper pail I purchased this one b/c it was cheaper. Big mistake. It is not odor-less! I saw a friend's Diaper Champ and was convinced and purchased it instead. It works great and also uses kitchen bags. It is worth the extra money. You can get your money back from this diaper pail by calling the customer service number on the instruction manual and sending a portion of it back. I received my refund within a few weeks! I'm not sure about Safety 1st products now, all the reviews of their products seem to be bad & we had a salesperson tell us not to buy a Cosco brand car seat and Safety 1st is a Cosco brand."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this diaper pail, like many others, because it was cheaper and used standard trash bags instead of costly liners. That is the only good thing this pail has going for it. My son is 8 months old, and the springs keep popping off of it. This diaper pail does not keep the smell out, either. The opening that the diapers go into will no longer close, so each time you lift the lid you get a whiff of what is inside. You are supposed to be able to ""twist and seal"" the trash bags when changing, which doesn't work. Each time you change the bag, you have to pull it out, and when you replace it you have to thread the bag through the top. This diaper pail is smaller than ""standard trash can liners"", which means when the pail gets full, you pull out the trash can liner only to find it is only half full of diapers. I'm ready to throw this diaper pail into the garbage, which is where I've been putting most of the dirty diapers directly, anyhow."
2,replacement scented chip,"We are having...problem[s]...The scented chip worked, but only for a few months. Any one have any luck replacing it? I've looked in the stores but had no luck."
1,I hate it!!!,"This is by no means ""odorless"". It smells with even 1 dirty diaper. My now 15 month old can just ""pop"" open the top and reach in and pull out the dirty diapers- yuck! Her room constantly smells like diapers so we throw out the dirty ones in the garage and just use the diaper pail for wet ones. I would NOT recommend it. I am expecting #2 and will have to buy another diaper pail."
2,Odorless?,This diaper pail is far from odorless. The poop diapers smelled so much that we moved it into the garage but the flies were so bad that we moved it back in the house and put it in a closet. Now every poop diaper I put in a ziplock first. The only good thing is that it takes regular diaper bags and it's a place to put messy diapers.
4,Easy and convenient to use,"This diaper is easy and very convenient to use. The only complaint I have is that the lid sometimes pops open on its own and I can't figure out why. Otherwise, it does contain odor and is much easier to use than a diaper genie. It's also much less expensive because you don't need to purchase special bags for the bucket."
1,What a deceptive description...,"I've found that the Odor-Less Diaper Pail is nowhere near odorless!! It was okay when our baby was still making the non-smelly diapers, but FORGET IT once your kid is on solids. My husband empties that pail every few days (then sprays the inside with Lysol) when it's only filled with pee pee diapers. And it is ready to be emptied by then, because it reeks of urine. Don't even think about keeping poopy diapers in there!! We have to dump poop, from a soiled diaper, in the toilet and just throw away the diaper because the Odor-Less Diaper Pail DOES NOT contain the smell. Buyer BEWARE! (This product doesn't deserve 1 star!)"
2,Go for a more expensive pail...it'll be worth it.,"I thought I would like this one...seemed easy to use, and didn't require special refills. I got it home and the push button on the top of the pail to open it was already broken. I didnt get a good vibe that this was gonna last if I returned it for another one. Im definately going with the Diaper Champ. Its a little more money, but the idea behind it makes a lot of sense, and it seems that it will live up to its name."
1,DON'T BUY!,"With 3 girls, 2 in diapers, this pail is full all the time. It doesn't keep out odors because it stunk up the whole house and isn't sturdy either. One time it tipped over....nuff said!"
1,Do Not Buy This,"This is the worst excuse for a diaper pail that I have ever seen. After a very short time, even with just pee diapers, this pail STUNK. I cleaned it out daily, but the plastic of this pail just seemed to absorb the odor. The scented disc that is included does NOT neutralize odors... it doesn't even cover them up. I scrubbed, soaked, and sanitized this thing trying to keep it as clean as possible, and it is just not worth the time or effort. For this baby I have purchased the Diaper Champ - we'll see how it holds up. NOTHING could be worse than this useless thing!!!"
2,Definately NOT odor-less,"I got this diaper pail thinking of the cost savings being able to use regular kitchen garbage bags. Well it's not a cost savings and definately no help on the smell. I have tried scented kitchen bags and it seems to make the smell worse with the 2 different scents. My son's room always smells like dirty diapers. I have tried airfreshers, baking soda, soaking in Pine-sol for a day and even with no diapers it smells. I regret buying this one and now will get a different one and pay the extra cost for the bags. Another thing is the chamber you open to put the diapers in pops open unexpectedly. Not a very good locking system."
1,Not worth it...,"I got this as a shower gift and thought it was an excellent gift. I changed my mind very quickly. My son is only 3 1/2 months old and it is already smelling up my son's room. The little deodarizer thing doesn't do anything! Also the first time I changed the bag, the springs broke under the top. I still use it because it's the only thing I have, but I would not reccommend this to anyone. One day, I'll spend the money and get a better one."
1,STINKY!!,"What a waste of money! I had this in my baby's room for about a week before it started smelling up the entire room! I tried putting it in the garage, but it even smelled up the garage. Don't bother!"
1,odor-less diaper pail,"With my 1st baby i had received a diaper genie and really liked it, but this time i wanted to save money at least i thought i did by buying a cheaper diaper pail. But its not worth it i'm not very happy with this product. It uses regular size 13 gal trash bags but it fills up so fast i am changing it every couple of days i do not recommend this product. I recommend spending a little more money you will be happy in the end."
1,Not what it seems,"This pail caught my eye with its promise to eliminate smell and what looked like ease of use. It is difficult to get the bag in, you must push the diaper past the &quot;diaphragm&quot;, often the springs come undone, and the plastic soaked in the diaper odor so it is consistently smelly. Also, you have to use a full size garbage bag and waste most of the bag space. Try it if you wish, but I'll be shopping for a new one for my next baby!!"
4,"So far, so good!",I am the mother of a breastfed 3 month old and have had this pail for about a month now. My baby sleeps in our room and so I needed a trashcan for those middle of the night diapers. This diaperpail is sitting right next to my HEAD beside the bed and it contains all of the odors quite well and I ususally put 2-3 poopies in there per day.I gave this 4 stars because the flaps on the inside do not close all the way together when there are several diapers inside. The result is that when I open it to change the bag (usually twice a week) the odors do come out! My only other problem with it is that it is hard to push the button to open the top with a squirmy baby there.
4,No Problems Here,"We have this diaper pail, and it seems to work fine for us. Our son is one year old now, and the pail is working fine. The springs have never popped off and odors are very low. Yes, the capacity fills up rather quickly, but that really isn't a problem. It is easy to use and can be filled with household bags. I registered for another one for baby #2."
3,Good Diaper Pail!,I think this diaper pail does a decent job of controlling odor as long as you open and close the lid quickly when disposing of a diaper. I love the fact that it takes regular trash bags. You can use scented ones to help control the odor more. It is easy and convienent to use. Only problem that I have found is that after a period of time the scented disc in the lid loses the scent and I can't find replacement discs.
3,Ok for the money,"The pail is OK. It's nice to use regular trash bags. The twist and seal feature does not work. Sometimes the lid does not pop up unless you push the button a certain way which is frustrating in the middle of the night and my daughter is crying. I'm pretty laid back, but that really irritates me for some reason. The smell is only noticeable when opened unless there is a really poopy diaper in there. We change the bag every two days or so. Since we've heard the more expensive, fancy diaper systems are no better, we think this one works pretty well and we do not believe there can ever be such a thing as an &quot;odorless&quot; diaper pail. I like another reviewer's idea of wrapping diapers in a plastic shopping bag before placing them in the bin."
1,Not So Oder-less Diaper Pail,"I had asked for a Diaper Genie for my first child and got this instead. I tried to return it but was unable to( they were out of the Genie). My husband suggested that we give it a try because we had to put the diapers somewhere. I think it lasted a few months when the spring on the inside of the lid popped out and we could not keep it closed properly anymore. Besides that, it never was truely oder-less and it was not easy to keep the bags in place without the mechanism tearing them. I am due in Sept. & have purchased a Diper Genie this time just like I had wanted. For the price difference it is not worth it."
1,"Ooooh, STINKY!!","This diaper pail not only stinks, but it stinks up the whole room!!! We have an eight-month old and have to get another diaper pail now because we would love to be able to actually use my son's room! We avoid it at all costs now due to this stinky pail! Save your money!! Don't get it and choose something else. Odor-less my ...!"
2,One problem after another,"I purchased this diaper pail for my son and let me tell you it was more work keeping up this pail then it was caring for a newborn. We purchased this product because there were no special bags to buy and it had an area to place deoderizer tablets. Well the spring popped off every time we put a diaper in it which left a space for the smell to come out. It was nasty. We had to constantly fix the springs just so it was close up each time. The pail stunk so bad even with the tablets and an air freshener in the bottom of the bucket. It was so bad, we soaked it and washed it and it still stunk. We ended up throwing it in the dumpster. It was just horrible. Not a good product and poorly made."
1,Not So Odorless diaper pail,"I bought this diaper pail because the store had run out of the Fisher Price pail I had originally intended to buy. Boy was I sorry!! Aside from the fact that the diaper pail fell apart into many little pieces every time I went to change the bag, It did not contain the quite pungent odor that accompanies dirty diapers.While this diaper pail was cheaper than the Diaper Genie, I found it to be a complete waste of my hard earned money, as it doesn't even serve well as a basic trash can."
1,Hated It,This pail is not orderless and it is very inconvient. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I have a daycare and the pail stays smelly all the time!!
1,there is a reason....,"well i do high mountain climbing quite often and never seen an eureka there, the reasons?too heavy (compared to similar tents like the hillebergs or the ev25 from north face) and under very heavy conditions simply not tested enough, i had seen one of these rip under extreme weather on mt ranier, had to take the guys into our tent, they were not happy.My tent? a hilleberg saiva. But this is the review of the eureka and my experience is that for cold climate is not suited I slept in one this winter and it was -22 celsius, it was like sleeping outside, with all the mesh, no heat was trapped inside and we had ice forming on the inside of the outer layer.All in all not a tent i would recommend if you are going to use it in extreme conditions (aka I won't bet my life on it for sure).for all other uses it might be fine but the weight is just a lot, on the other hand the price is interesting."
5,Lifetime Picnic Table,Received the package very quick but the box was torn to hell and back. The table had a couple of dings but overall was ok. It was easy to assemble and set up.
2,Rough shipping and thin plastic,"UPS left this table at my front door with both ends of the box open and contents coming out. I'm an environmentalist at heart so the idea of swapping this out for a new one didn't appeal to me. The legs and top had minor scratches, but not enough to justify the bother and waste of a product return. Assembly is easy with a screw driver only - takes about a half hour. What I didn't like is that the plastic on the frame is so thin in spots that most of the mounting screws don't tighten down. In other words, they strip. The screws are not critical for structural support but over time the seats could loosen up. With a molded product like this, it would be easy to simply mold in thicker plastic where the screws go. Disappointing. Otherwise, table is level and attractive as advertised."
4,a great table,The picnic table is great. Easy to put together and folds for easy storage. The only downside was the packaging that it came in. The box was pretty much destroyed when I received it and the frail packaging seemed to have caused the small dent on the bench. Aside from that it is a great table.
3,not quiet as indicated,"The shipping box was torn in a couple places when it arrived at our residence, looked like the shipper was not very careful with it. Then as we unpacked the product we noticed that it is ""made in China"" and not as promised in the descriptions ""manufactured in the U.S.A,"" I cringed at this fact as I am trying to buy more products made here in the U.S. Had I known I may have not bought this particular item although over all it is a nice table, fairly easy to assemble, yet it takes two people, and it seems sturdy and low maintenance, I guess ""only time will tell."" It did have a scratch on the tabletop, we assume that it was caused by the shipper but yet we decided to keep the product as the packaging material, including styrofoam, was too beat up to return. I am a little disappointed not so much in the product but more so how it arrived and the misinformation given on where it was produced, that was very misleading!"
2,NOT THAT IMPRESSED!,"We ordered this table instead of a regular picnic table, because it is ""lifetime."" Yea right!! It's has a lifetime guarantee for TWO YEARS! What a joke. All the directions are in pictures - no words, and pretty vague. It's pretty flimsy. Also, had some dents and scratches on it from shipping. Pretty much a rip off for $236.00. Made in China, of course!! May be worth about $75 tops. Buy a picnic table for $75 bucks at your local Home Depot and have a ""lifetime"" of enjoyment with your family. It's made much better, and sturdier."
2,Poor shipping performance,While the table itself is nice however it arrived in a box that looked like it had been in a train wreck. Table itself has a couple of minor dents. I'd certainly not buy from this company again.
2,plastic table,"I was considering purchasing and saw one of these at a local country club. The table needed a powerwash but other than that seemed solid .. I couldn't tell if it had been there for 3 or 10 years and the thing looked indestrucible. It was obvious that a powerwash would clean it up nicely. The only problem was.. I couldn't help but feel like I was sitting at a plastic table. For me it just didn't work. There are lots of simulated and/or lifetime wood products that ARE plastic but they don't feel like it and give the impression of sitting on wood. Even if it might last forever and were easy to hose off,I didn't want this big plastic thing in my yard. To me it felt like a really big child's play set."
4,Good table. No instruction sheets include however.,"Pro: The table seems good, sturdy, and well designed. We are happy with the assembled product.Con: The table came with no instruction sheet. The photo on the cardboard container was not detailed enough to make it obvious that some of the metal strips on the bottom of the table top and side-benches had to be unbolted and then re-attached in order to assemble the whole thing. It did not explain what to do with the two S-shaped black pieces of plastic (which were meant to lock the table legs together when the table has been folded). A simple instruction guide would have made a difference. Perhaps they just forgot to include it. We figured it all out, but it was an annoying omission."
2,Made Ballet Boring,"I did this video with my daughter. We did about half of it, and then she said that she wanted to try another DVD. It just had a person demonstrating the step, and then another of the class repeating it. No instruction with the class repeating the step, so I had to tell my daughter what came next. It went from one thing to another and did not combine these steps into a dance. Although there was music, it did not enhance the experience. We may still use this disk in the future to practice specific steps. Other Ballet class DVD's have better instruction."
4,"Good reference, but lacks editorial comment","I find this book very helpful in locating trails. It has good descriptions of how to locate trailheads, including milage and Forest Service road numbers, but it lacks important comment about scenery and how one area compares to another. Also I would like to know the condition of the trails. Are they used by those repulsive four wheelers? Is this area a non-motorized use area or not? But other than that the descriptions of trails if very informative."
3,Reads like a horoscope,"Anyone who is at all familiar with cold reading will see the profiles are about as useful and accurate as knowing your star sign. ""You are friendly with a lot of people but only have one or two close friends"" is a classic cold read. There are a few good insights but when you account for the volume of truisms that make up the bulk of the profiles you feel a little bit cheated."
2,"Good information, but presented in boring fashion","Although the information may be true, the manner of writing, in the third person all the time, ""Isaacson says...., Isaacson found..., just puts one to sleep. The book by Lehman is written in the first person and is much more entertaining."
1,Inaccurate Copy of Beethoven OP. 6,"Notes are incorrect in this EveryNote version. Obviously, there was some carelessness in copying it. Also, the measures are not numbered and fingering is missing. Don't buy this."
2,"Blase', Boring and Belaboured","The premise is great!! That's about it. It drags on interminably with talk, talk, talk about the ""clothes designer"" business (fabrics, synthetics, etc). and focuses more on that than the story!! Give us the meat!! This is like having a sandwich with only the bread and nothing in between. The vulgar language in this book is not as prevalent (though there is some). I did not enjoy this book."
2,A Little Disapointed,I was somewhat disapointed with the condition of this book.A page was partially torn off and there were crayon scribbles on anotherpage. I was replacing a lost book and was hoping to get one in bettercondition than this one was. I do appreciate the quick shipping though.
2,ZZZ.....,"I thought this book was boring and too drawn out. It took me over 3 months to read simply because I didn't want to pick it back up! The plot was good...it was different but as with all of Ms. Steel's novels, it is centered around a beautiful rich, successful woman, Isabella, who has some sort of tragedy and we read about her sadness and depression for most of the book until she finally meets someone to help her pick up the shattered pieces of her broken heart. This book is very, very slow and I found myself falling asleep every time I read it. I would not reccommend it. She has better novels out there."
2,Ms. Steel can do much better,I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and this has been the worst so far.
1,Bad Choice,What a joke!! I ordered these for my kids for Christmas. They had just gotten into bowling and thought they would make great stocking stuffers. Very disappointed in the merchandise. The hem was not finished! It was just cut off. I had to hem them myself before I could give them away.
3,Thomas Guide to Washington DC,"This is guide provides the excellent reference I expect from Thomas Bros. I would like it much more if it was confined to the city of Washington, DC instead of including Virginia and Maryland. Including these areas makes the Guide very bulky, otherwise it is perfect."
5,"Superbly done, great reggae dance track.",This is roots rock reggae in a classic format yet vibrant and powerful. Crispy background vocals and a cultural mix and bass riffs that will rock your speakers.A got to have CD!
1,Dry and boring,"There needs to be a choice for ZERO stars.While the pictures are nice, and their website (www amazingclubs com) specifically bolds the statement that they have the ""freshest and most mouth-watering desserts"" it is the complete opposite. The first month we received dry brownies that were slightly smashed and crumbling. The second month was a small dry marble bundt cake (no way would it serve 8-12 even if you wanted to) and just now received white chocolate chip cookies that were (you guessed it) dry. Hard to believe that they are getting away with selling a dozen or so average-at-best brownies and a few more cookies for $28 a pop. This is a great racket for them, but hopefully I can post this review in enough places that they won't take anymore people in. Definitely NOT gourmet - do not order this."
5,Mr. Perahia is superb!,"This is my first Murray Perahia CD. The music was recorded in 1982 and 1983. What a treasure! The sound quality is great. But more importantly, the music is superb. Mr. Perahia's playing is elegant, musical, and unaffected. I love his lyrical and chromatic performance of the Rondo Capricioso in E."
3,The price is right,"Having purchased it for $0.01, I cannot complain, but having said that the price can't be far off what its worth."
5,Beautiful,I purchased this some time ago...I receive compliments on it all the time. It is sturdy and beautiful at the same time.
4,Hopefully will defy my age!,This product is very creamy & goes a long way. It really doesn't take much to do my whole face. 4 stars because I wish it would cover just a tad bit better. It was received quickly & well packed for shipping. Thank you.
1,not for me,"I have acne prone skin, and I am old(40), bummer right? This was not a good match for me at all. I read a lot of great reviews and thought maybe I finally found a good base for my skin. I was disappointed it did not work for me. It does Sounds like it does well for others. Make-up is one of those things you just have to try unfortunately."
1,"VERY BAD ITEM, LASTED 11 MONTHS, HORRIBLE, ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH FOR THIS","I bought this last January 2012 and after about 10 months or so i noticed that there was a concave shape in the center, i am a light person only weighing 140 lbs so not sure why it could not retain its shape. in last few months of use i'd wake up with back pain and tiredness, the foam was becoming softer and the center was a huge uneven center, going back to a spring mattress with pillow top, dont waste your money on this crap, wish i couldve gave it 0 stars"
4,"Love it, wish it was a bit more durable!","We love the concept of the mesh bottom spring float. The first few times we used it, it couldn't have been better. But over the course of the summer, the frame started to bend; now, you can't lay on the float without the right side caving in. Not bad for the price, though."
2,Silly and predictable.,"Jessica is in love with A.J., but can it last? A slam book has called Jess a big ""flirt"" and A.J. likes quiet,shy girls (girls like Liz). Can Jess completely transform her personality to make A.J. like her? What do you think? One important lesson to learn : Don't start slam books. They are more trouble than fun"
1,Terrible...,"Bought this for classroom use a new Epson projector and Sony DVD player. Immediately after connecting, there was major distortion in the picture. I checked it with a Monster S-Video cable and it worked flawlessly.Don't waste your time or money on this."
1,japan's war in color,"A reader's review from fremont california usa :After looking through this book ,I got a feeling of big disapointment, The quality of pictures in this book is not good and the number of pictures is fewer than i had expected,The contents of this book are very simple and not well organized ,The author could have done better job about this book before publishing it,If you are looking for books about japan in world war ii,You should look somewhere else!"
3,"Not bad, but music from first series was better.","I've just ordered the earlier album (1954-whatever); I got this one at a store not knowing previously that such CDs existed. These recordings are OK -- a few of the tracks are actually good -- but on the average, this music isn't as vibrant as the music from the first series. Two standouts: the end title of Godzilla vs. Destroyer quotes the old tribal music from King Kong vs. Godzilla, which I didn't notice when I watched the movie; the Mothra song is pretty memorable. The last track, Monster Zero March, is a heavy-synthesizer remix of some music from the first series. It's pretty tinny and ultimately rather cheesy.If you like the Godzilla movie music at all, this is worth picking up. I suspect the album of music from the first series is probably better."
3,"Good selection, given the sources","There are fewer ""modern"" Godzilla films to draw from, so there are more themes from each film than in the '54-'75 CD. Sadly, most non-Ifukube themes are second-rate (and some downright inappropriate, such as the light romantic closing themes from ""G. Vs. Biollante"" and ""...SpaceGodzilla""), but some of them work, and all are at least pleasant to listen to. Too many variations of same theme in some cases. As with the earlier CD, the best themes are Ifukube's, including the ""Requiem"" and ""Ending Title"" ones from ""...Destoroyah"". And the closing Neil Norman rendition of ""Monster Zero March"" is super!"
4,Great CD for Godzilla fans...,"I ordered this CD a while ago and it finally arrived. Before it arrived I had read some reviews that complained about it (especially the music from Godzilla vs SpaceGodzilla). After listening to it, I must say that there is only 1 problem with this CD, and that is the final track on it. This track is chessy in the extreme and is just plain bad."
5,from the introduction,"In this world where our moral and ethical values are all too often compromised, this book about personal integrity is desperately needed to help us build character. Charles Dyer, the author is professor of Bible exposition at a Theological Seminary and assistant to the president.This book helps us to understand the Bible better. The reader visits some of the most fscinating people who inhabit the pages of the Bible. The author invites the reader to pause and ask God yo give him an understanding mind and a sensitive heart before he starts reading this book which covers honesty, compassion, wisdom, self-control, joy, trust, faithfulness, balance, sexual purity and endurance."
2,Buy something else!!,"We were happy with this TV at the start. After our warranty ran out--so did the TV. One day the TV just would not turn on even after several attempts to unplug and plug it back in which only resulted in pop, snap. die! We have been waiting almost four weeks for parts to repair it. Panasonic has not sent the parts needed as requested by our repair shop. We have been given several excuses about what had caused the problem and why it hasn't been fixed. From ""the power supply"" to ""acid leaking on the board"" to ""waiting for parts from Panasonic"". From day one this TV had an arch across the bottom of the picture when viewing widescreen. We were willing to put up with this first problem. But after waiting over a month for this major repair we are in the process of now purchasing a different brand of TV. We would highly recommend that you think twice about purchasing this Panasonic lemon."
5,Superb,"Superb! Excelsior! Extraordinary! Post-Apocalyptic!This is wonderful baroque brass. There's all the order of the late baroque (early classical) composition, and all the beautiful clarity and brilliance of Marsalis on trumpet and his brass support as well.It lacks the authentic baroque feel: that perfectly loose organization--but still, in this case, it doesn't matter."
1,"No Heart, No Soul, No Feel for the Music","Wynton Marsalis may be the finest technician on trumpet today, but that's about all. I listened to this album once; that was enough. I gave it one star because I couldn't give it zero. If you want trumpeters who play Baroque music with beauty and grace, listen to Maurice Andre', Ludwig Guttler, and Adolf Scherbaum."
2,short duration record,"Persons this record i fell shorth changed,only about 47 minutes, so they can fill up to 74 minutes.where are the missing minutes?? marsalis knows how to play more music. I meet hin in person in 1987, and we have a nice chat.so a penalty i will NOT BUY recordins done by him any more.I will do with mr Harerberger to hear what happens."
4,Easy and interesting read,"I am a pilot, not a sailor but Peter's book was very interesting and almost makes me want to switch hobbies."
3,Good but not great.,Nice book about crossing the Atlantic mixxed with reflections on the writer's failed marriage. Nothing new or real exciting about the book. I thought his reflections on his marriage over indulgent and sometimes boring. I kept wanting to tell him to get a girlfriend so that he could forget his depressing wife.The sailing part is fun but there are much better naratives.
1,So Disappointing,"I had hoped for something like an ""Into Thin Air"" where I'd get caught up in an endeavor I know little about, but respect and be blown away.Not a bit. This is a long winded account of a man's journey across the Atlantic. I expected he'd have to bail out or really fight to survive. Not so much. He provides every account of his musings on his failed marriage and on other more interesting journeys across the Atlantic. His insights on his marriage, the journey and life seem commonplace, rather than enlightening.His writing isn't that great and in places made me groan. Take this: ""Instinctively, without thinking I . . ."" Instinctively means without thinking.I expected more adventure and insight. I skipped paragraphs of banal descriptions just to get to the end. I rarely do that as a reader."
1,"If we learn from mistakes, this is a treasure chest!",A very detailed lesson on how not to undertake a sea crossing. Peter describes in great detail his lack of preparedness and his lessons wasted. The truly amazing thing in this story is that he survived and then is foolish enough to tell the tale. A great read for anyone contemplating voyaging and most instructive in lessons not learned.
3,scissors,a good price. i liked the scissors but they were a little dulller than i liked. i also switched to the bent scissors
1,never again !!,"I was verry unhappy with the product, seller, and all of it. I was new to buuing in line, and didnot understand about the code to let it play in U.S. I still feel it was a costly way to learn. I still hav'nt found the movies i wanted, I was diaapointed with the processing time from outside the U.S. HSP"
3,Packaging Problems,"Recently cancelled Amazon subscription for a bag of these beans every month. Last two shipments arrived with vacuum seal on the bag broken. The shipping packaging suggests that this is a factory problem, not one with Amazon, but nevertheless the freshness of the beans is compromised. The question of product tampering arises as well. Can't claim any expert opinion on the quality of the beans, were good enough for me and attractively priced. But the vacuum packing is for a good reason, and they've been shipping defective product to/for Amazon, I suspect."
5,Great coffee,I like a deep roasted aromatic coffee that can stand up to a huge slosh of half and half. This one can. I'll buy again.
2,More Bad Coffee from Amazon,"This is the second, and last, time I will buy coffee from amazon.com. The first time, I received a bag of coffee that had been out of date for months. This time, it's still stale, but without a use-by date on the bag. So much for trying to save some money and time. I'll go back to making the trek to Whole Foods."
2,Perhaps a bad bag?,"I don't know if I got a bad bag, but the beans that I received smelled extremely funky. Almost fishy. The coffee that they made was decent, certainly better than I would have expected given the smell of the un-ground beans. Nevertheless, I threw most of the package away, as I couldn't stand the smell of the beans, even when only semi-conscious in the morning (before drinking coffee, of course)."
3,Not my favorite,"I like Cafe Altura coffees. This is the first San Francisco blend that i've tried. So, I don't know if it's the style or if it's just Cafe Altura's version that didn't appeal to me. Just had a weird taste. I wasn't terrible. But I won't reorder."
3,Not bad,"The coffee is smooth and not acidic at all. It is, however, very oily, so much so that it clumps inside my grinder. Wish it had a richer taste. It helps to make it a little stronger than normal. It is not as wonderful as the San Francisco coffee that I remember from about 15 years ago on a trip, but I don't know who the roaster was. Guess you can drink to a memory, but not drink one itself. Oh, well. Only problem was that the delivery person left it down the block somewhere, and and the package got wet during a deluge. The packaging of the coffee itself was strong enough to withstand that. However, I couldn't open it and had to end up cutting off the resealable strip."
5,I love Joe McGinniss,This true tale is gripping. McGinniss did an excellent job telling the story. I can't put this book down. Superb.
5,Heartbreaking,"Well written, very good book. My heart goes out to those boys whose mother seemed like a saint. God bless them."
3,Too Much Detail,"As with a lot of non-fiction works, sometimes the detail can become overwhelming - as I believe it did in this case. There were a lot of communications between NJ characters and characters in Florida to the point where it actually became confusing.The details and story behind the ""killer"" were very very interesting and interwoven perfectly. I think a better job could have been done on making the ""victim"" more of a personality."
2,Disappointing,After reading Fatal Vision recently it was a slow and somehat boring read. Maybe my expectations for a Joe McGinniss book were too high. You kind of know from the start that there is an open and shut case murder case. No guessing game.
3,No pictures?,"This book was engrossing, sure - I mean, the story is disgusting. The husband here is so selfish and narcisstic that it is hard to read. However, it is disappointing that a) there are no pictures; b) the names of virtually all of the characters in the book have been changed; and c) the 'conversations' that the author plays out throughout the book are obviously embellished, and really take away from the validity of the story. Also, it would be nice to have the author include some updates since it has been so many years ago. It would have been nice to find out what the sons are now doing, etc."
4,good true crime,A little predictable and a little dated (30 years ago) but author does a good job of telling the story and keeping it interesting.
3,"Overlong and wordy, but readable","Having read Fatal Vision, and found it riveting, this was a let-down. Not as inherently interesting, and far too much corny characterisation and obviously fabricated dialogue."
5,A Great True Crime Page Turner,"I read this when it was first published 10 years ago and recently read it again, it is still one of the best of Joe McGinnis' books. Reads like a novel and you hate to put it down. The story takes off from the beginning and doesn't let go til the last page. If you collect true crime books this is a must-have."
2,"Flip flops named ""Butter"" - a little mis-leading","With a name like ""butter"" I expected soft, broken in and comfortable from these flip flops. Instead they were tight feeling, had a taller sole than originally thought and have yet to be comfortable enough for everyday wear."
4,Super comfy,"I love these shoes! They are so comfortable and living in Phoenix, I wear them everyday. My only complaint is that due to so much wear, after awhile they start to smell bad and you need to replace them after 6 months to a year. I have the brown in suede and haven't noticed it as much with those as I have with the black leather. Still, I like them enough that I replace them as needed because I wear them so much. I also like that they are not so flat. I like a little extra height and the thong part between the toes is cloth versus so it only kind that is comfortable for me. I bought my first pair about 5 years ago have owned several pairs since then!"
1,Defective fit,"The thong that goes between the toes was way too long so the sandal did not fit snugly enough. I know they are flip-flops, but they should stay on at the toe. Amazon did refund my money, but they charged me a re-stocking fee because the reason for the return was ""no fault of Amazon's."" I don't agree - I think there is a design flaw or this was a defective pair."
2,My feet bled. Seriously.,"I'm usually a big fan of Reef flip-flops, but these were very uncomfortable. The straps cut into my feet in several places. Within an hour or so of wearing them, I had blisters and some areas on the tops of my feet that were actually bleeding. Ouch! It's really a shame, because they're very cute sandals! (I have them in saddle/gold.) Maybe I should've broken them in better before I wore them outside...?"
1,nostalgia for a bucolic utopia,"From a writer with a progressive reputation, this book was disappointing. Sabato rails humourlessly against modern mass media, showing no conception that tools like the Internet can be put to positive use. We're ponderously told that our present crisis is due to `exploitation of man', as if that's insightful, or specific to our age. He yearns for times past when, supposedly, people `worked at a more human level' and `were freer than the man of today'. In our own hopeless age it's supposedly impossible to transmit values to new generations. Even smallpox eradication is decried as making room for cancer. Reminiscent of William Morris, Sabato looks forward to returning to the Middle Ages (`una nueva Edad Media'), which he thinks would be curative (`sanante'). I'm currently reading Galeano's Patas Arriba, looking for a vision of how to improve the future, not return to an imaginary past."
2,6 months in and already starting to die,"Bought mine directly from Amazon. Like the original lithiom battery that came with the phone, the battery life is starting to fade. When I first got it, I could get over 2 hours of talk time, but after 6 months it's down to maybe 60-70 minutes. From what people have told me, this is pretty much to be expected with these types of batteries. I will likely just get a new phone when my contract expires since I don't like the idea of spending $50 to replace my battery every year."
1,WRONG PICTURE,I order this battery by this picture but a got a different oneAccessoryOne bad service.
4,"I like it, you may not","This keyboard has a nice feel and a sensible layout, but keyboards are a very personal thing, and this one may drive some people nuts.Even with the tilt-up legs extended, it sits very flat on the desk. If you (and your fingers) are accustomed to a ""high rise"" keyboard (like the original Mac keyboards and the newer white Apple keyboards), then this might not be your keyboard.The mouse is an odd shape but is comfortable and easy to use. It is clearly designed for ""righties"", however."
5,Great keyboard,"This keyboard/mouse combo work great. I am used to a ""normal"" keyboard and did not like the keyboard/mouse that come with the imac. Please note that the driver included is not the latest. When I first installed the included software it told me it ""did not work with intel based macs."" I downloaded the driver from Logitech's website and it worked perfectly. Keyboard and mouse are heavy and have a good quality feel about them. Well worth the price and great service from Amazon.com!"
2,Better to buy a quality apple bluetooth wireless keyboard,"Works great for the first couple of days, and then the mouse becomes unresponsive, followed by the keyboard. I have the latest driver offered by Logitech, but still having problems. If you do not want to have to reinstall the drivers time and again, try another keyboard and mouse combo. Though tempting, save yourself the hassle and buy a quality product.Quick access keys on keyboard and mouse are convenient; however they feel cheap. The keyboard has slow responsiveness and there is not a good typing feel when you depress the keys.BUY A DIFFERENT KEYBOARD AND MOUSE!"
1,I give up!,"Mouse works fine, keyboard works sporadically.I gave up and trashed it. I tried customer support 2 times and also tried to research it myself to no avail. Perhaps with more time, and possibly returning the item, I could get it resolved but who has that kind of time?"
4,Watch out for bluetooth needs,This model is not bluetooth. The RF is logitech's proprietary (isn't all their stuff?) RF connection. Unit has fast setup and great response. Does not come close to the apple bluetooth solution however from a performance point of view. Get what you pay for - right?
2,"Returned item, wasn't blue tooth","I ordered this keyboard/mouse combo and it turned out to not be blue tooth, so I returned it. I'm sure it would have been great if I had used it but my Mac has blue tooth and I thought I was getting a blue tooth kbd and mouse.I got an apple blue tooth keyboard instead and I found a logitech blue tooth mouse, which I also got. (Apple doesn't offer a decent blue tooth 2 button mouse in anything like an acceptably reasonable price range)."
5,(Un)Plug and play,"I've now had this keyboard/mouse combo for over a month and no problems whatsoever. I unpacked it, put batteries in, and voila. All items should be so easy. Highly recommended as a lower-priced alternative to the Apple cordless keyboard and mouse--that sell separately, by the way, in typical Apple a la carte accessory mode."
4,Good keyboard and mouse; more solid than they look,"I'm typing on the keyboard right now.I was a little surprised by the look of the keyboard. It looks a bit flimsy. The round buttons on the side look a bit cheap, out of place on a Logitech keyboard. But - it feels great. I'm very comfortable typing on it, and my accurate typing speed is definitely higher than it was on my old Mac keyboard.I'm not sure about the ""it's not all white"" complaint. If you look at the photo, it's clear that there's some non-white on it (it's just silver-ish plastic; there's no metal in its case), and the description makes it clear that it's white and silver.And, just so you know - it works just fine if you plug the receiver into a PC instead of a Mac."
2,Not all that good...,"I wanted to like this keyboard. But I found it annoying that I had to use a USB port for it. Reception also was fairly poor, and keyed-in letters sometimes would not appear. I also had hard time adjusting to the keys. For me they have too much ""dish"" and it was easy to mis-type. Overall feel of unit and mouse also seemed a bit cheap.On the up side, setup was easy, and tactile feel pretty good. Functions well with a Mac.That said, I returned mine."
5,Very nice keyboard and mouse for my MAC,"It is quality set! The keyboard is very well made with convenient key path, very logical keys layout and extremely well made mouse. It is by far better than new Apple's offering, it allows very fast, noise free typing and a mouse that is a pleasure to hold!Cool!"
4,Logitech excellent choice for Mac,This product has more flexibility and features for the money than others including a cordless mouse
4,good keyboard for the money,It is a nice set with the mouse and keyboard. I use it everyday I only wish the batteries lasted a little longer in them.
5,Plug & Play Works!!!,"Firstly the keyboard just looks straight up sexy. Very clean design! The keys feel very padded and are fairly quiet. Best of all, plug & play actually pulled through! My computer was off, plugged in the USB dongle, and booted up. The mouse and keyboard worked right away. Woohoo!"
3,Great Mouse! Keyboard Needs Work.,"The wireless keyboard and mouse that came with my Mac Pro desktop were fun to look at but useless in any practical sense. I invested in the Logitech S 530 package. The mouse is fabulous, but the keyboard with all its sophisticated bells and whistles has a couple of fundamental flaws that Logitech needs to address.1. Make the keyboard (and mouse) directly connectible to the Mac's built-in Bluetooth and eliminate the superfluous Logitech USB dongle. (My Logitech V470 Bluetooth Cordless Mouse works just fine this way with my Mac Book---no dongle.)2. Add some sort of Caps Lock indicator (light in the key would work just fine).3. Eliminate whatever it is that ""talks"" to the Mac while it's in Sleep mode and wakes it up. With the keyboard powered up, my Mac will not Sleep for more than about 5 seconds before waking up again. Talk about insomnia!I own and operate a number of pieces of Logitech gear. The S 530 Cordless Desktop for Mac is the only one ever to disappoint."
2,mouse scroller too slow,"i thot i found ""the"" keyboard mouse set, but the mouse scroller is just way too slow, even with the scroller settings set to the fastest mode possible :( i run a mac book pro."
5,excellent!!!,well made good quality product from a trusted name such as logitech. keyboard is ergonomically designed and well constructed along with the mouse. software and drivers work wonderfully with the mac interface. only complaint is that the keyboard does not have any sort of caps lock light.
4,Good form okay function,"this setup would be great for a home Computer, i am using it on my MacBook Pro, and i have to turn the computer off and on again for the function buttons to work if i remove the dongle. Other than that, it is sleek cool comfortable, and easy to setup and to use. plus what are your other options?"
3,Good keyboard and mouse....,"But they still don't have Intel Mac support over at Logitech. It must be so hard to recompile and distribute =/The mouse and keyboard work fine, however, the mouse's volume buttons, and forward/back buttons do not work on Intel Macs, also, quick launch buttons do not work on keyboard. Other than that, this is a fine mouse and keyboard. If only it had the software to back it up!"
3,No Intel Mac Drivers,"This keyboard is great, however you cannot use the special itunes keys on the keyboard until Logitech get with it and does a driver update for intel macs. Other than that the keyboard is great with a low profile and very comfortable."
4,Looks good..works well..but its loud.,The look & functionality is excellent. I bought for my G5 Quad...just plug & go! The keys are sooo loud though! Overall I am happy w/ the product.
4,"Great SET!, Wireless range Lacking.","When i first installed this set i could not get it working for the life of me. I then relised i had a logitec mouse installed before with the control center software installed before. Once i uninstalled this and reinstalled the new software worked like a charm. I have now been using it for about 2 months with no hickup, and even had the reciver behind the mac mini. This stopped tonight, and i had to move it onto the exdternal stand which makes more clutter, but overall its a great set looks amazing, and add tons of funtionality to the mac."
4,Great Combo,"This is a great combo. Even though they are wireless there is never a hesitation when sitting down to use them.A previous keyboard I used hesitated when I first tried to type on it. The mouse tracks very well on any surface. The keyboard has a good feel to it and a nice selection of functions on the sides. The side keys for play, pause, and volume controls get a lot of use. The one thing that would improve the keyboard is to make it easier to find certain keys by feel instead of having to look at the keyboard. With practice I've gotten better at not having to look at the board, but it would be easier if the feel was a bit more distinct. Such as making the small bumps on the ""f"" and ""j"" keys a bit larger."
2,Logitech S530 wireless Keyboard and mouse,"Logitech Cordless Desktop S 530 Laser for Mac ( 967664-0403 )Extremely disappointing after using the new apple board. Keys are old style. They are noisy and cumbersome. The letters and symbols are pasted on to the keys and reflect light back to the user. (depending on angle of the light). The mouse is OK but there are so many controls you must zero them out or suffer a lot of ""accidental"" clicks. Wish I'd never bought it but I needed a wireless with a number pad."
1,DOA No Reply from Seller,"I unpackaged and connected this keyboard according to the instructions. It performed as if a key was stuck. After opening my browser, I noticed the letter B repeating in the search box. I had to remove the batteries to make it stop. After a little experimentation, I find that the B key sticks then doesn't work at all. Seller will not respond to my request for a replacement or refund."
3,"Good, not great, but not sure what would be better either","Overall, I'm happy with the product; it's got a nice look and feel and the mouse and keyboard are comfortable. I downloaded the correct drivers from the logitech site and everything works fine with my macbook pro - no problems with the shortcut keys, etc.The only complaint I have is that sometimes the USB signal seems slow or seems to have been lost. I have to ""reconnect"" the mouse sometimes by pushing the signal button on the USB receiver and then on the mouse. I'm not sure if this is due to the mouse itself, or due to the fact that I'm using this with a USB hub and not the USB port on my laptop. I tried it connected directly to the laptop and it seemed a bit better, but still more sluggish than my older logitech laptop mouse. There are only a couple wireless USB options out there for Macs though, if you don't like the Mighty Mouse..."
3,Really wanted to like it,"I've been a fan of Logitech mice for years and having just gotten an Intel iMac, thought this would be a good choice. No issues with the mouse, but the lack of sculpting on the keys and mushy feel -- completely different than the Duo I've used on a PC -- made me long for the original Apple keyboard, despite the lack of bells and whistles. Sadly, I sent it back."
2,Needs overhaul,"I purchased the Logitech S530 for MAC even after reading a few negative reviews. I wanted to give Logitech the benefit of the doubt. I did what several reviewers suggested and downloaded the software from Logitech;s website rather than using the CD. Almost immediately, some keys became ""dead"" using Microsoft Word 2004 for MAC. The keyboard worked ok while not in Word. Also the absence of an indicator for the caps key is disconcerting. I've returned to the trusty Apple keyboard!"
1,"Bad Device, Terrible Customer Service","I've owned several Logitech devices previously and never had a problem. I purchased this Keyboard/mouse shortly after it was introduced. The mouse will not maitain a connection to the USB transmitter. It has to be re ""connected"" 5-10 times per day. Logitechs customer service has been extremely slow to respond and even after working through all of their extensive trouble shooting steps it still will not work and they keep jerking me around about replacing the device.BAD PRODUCT and even WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!"
2,RECEIVER STOPPED WORKING,"I used the keyboard and mouse for a few weeks with no problems then they suddenly stopped working. After trobleshooting for hours I finally was able to decide that the problem was not with the mouse or keyboard but with the receiver, the little USB thingy that allows the keyboard and mouse to be wireless. As it turned out my boyfriend's brother has a different model of the logitech wireless keyboard and mouse duo and when I plugged his receiver into my computer my keyboard and mouse began to work again. I wrote to logitech asking if I could buy a replacement receiver but have had no reply. I just wanted to warn everyone of the perils of wireless hardware. I don't expect to hear from logitech and if I did I suspect they would tell me they don't have separate USB receivers to buy."
1,nice keyboard but bad driver,"I like the feel of the keyboard and it looks nice. I have been using it for three months. Constantly running into problems with the keyboard stop working, which often requires a restart or, worse, reinstall of the drivers. It does not support the latest OS X update 10.9.4, which has been out for awhile now."
5,Logitech S530 Cordless Desktop for Mac,A wonderful cordless desktop at a very reasonable price. The excellent Logitech software that comes with the desktop is easily updated and provides the ability to customize your keyboard and mouse to your personal liking. Highly recommended to those who want a full featured responsive cordless desktop.
2,Just did not last ...,"I have been a fan of Logitech products for some time. I'm afraid this time I'm not so happy.From the first I experienced strange mouse behavior, which I assumed was due to some software I was running. Troubleshooting led me to eventually uncover it being related to the mouse (mouse behavior normalized when I unplugged the logitech USB receiver).I still figured it to be software related ... then after 35 days, the mouse suddenly gave up the ghost.Since it has been more than 30 days - Amazon will not accept this as a return. This is also leaving me much less of an AMAZON fan. When I asked them what to do - they sent me a link to the Logitech web site. I guess now we'll see how that goes."
4,"Pretty darn good, but why no Bluetooth?","I was presently surprised at how good this thing is. Works as advertised, etc. My only disappointment is that they didn't take advantage of Apple's bluetooth capabilities."
2,Mushy and innacurate.,"I purchased a Mac last week switching from a Dell PC. I wanted a more PC like keyboard and mouse for my Mac. After trying the keyboard I found the keys to be mushy and very unresponsive. It also had a very cheap feel to it, very unlike Logitech. The mouse also was uncomfortable to use the side buttons. I found it to be innacurate in its tracking. Stick with the keyboard and mouse that comes with the Mac."
2,keyboard doesnt work,"The keyboard doesnt work, The mouse is fine but when I went to connect the keyboard it told me to press the botton next to the Z but i dont know what that means because none of them work."
2,fix the @#$@ing driver!,"Bought this because of the logitech rep and aesthetic appeal for matching my new macbook.It worked flawlessly on startup - but after shutting down the computer and restarting, it is no longer recognized through the control manager. A reconnect with the mouse/keyboard finally got them recognized but the multimedia keys no longer work. Now I am losing connectivity every so often (once already during this review - and yes the batteries are 3-day fresh). There is quite a bit of input lag as well - something I could deal with if it wasn't plagued with so many other problems already.I'm going to try to revert back to the older versions of the LCC and see if that fixes anything, but if not this is going back.If you can get it to work well - its a nice feeling/looking set, but these control/driver problems are too much to deal with."
2,Logitech Cordless keyboard S 530 - IS NOT FOR MAC-INTEL,"I ordered a combo set of this keybd with wireless mouse and had to cancel the order hours later after reading a review of incompatibility with Intel based iMac.I immediately called the vendor and their tech support confirmed that.Apparently, when used with Mac-Intel machine, some of the special keys will not work at-all even with a software update. I guess it works well with non-Intel Macs.So I'm back on the net searching for a true 3rd-party cordless kybd/Mouse for MacIntel."
5,Great Keyboard and Mouse!,"This keyboard and mouse have been wonderful. It is an upgrade to the standard mouse and keyboard that come with the Apple desktop computers. I'm a writer/editor, and after a while of typing, my wrists would hurt from the upward slant of the Apple keyboard. But, with this keyboard, I'm able to type for hours a day with no pain whatsoever becasue this keybaord is so thin and flat. I like the look of the Apple Keyboard and Mighty mouse better, but the ease of use and comfort that I have using this keybaord and mouse far suprasses. The mouse conforms to my hand well and has all the functionality that I need. The butttons for launching applications are placed in weird spots, but after a little while you get used to them. If you are looking for a keyboard/mouse upgrade, then look no further. It is a great product for the price."
1,Not good for graphic design,"The mouse is extremely heavy and has little to no accuracy. The maximum scroll ball speed is way too slow. I like the keyboard and have no problems with it but unfortunately, this is a mouse/keyboard combo product.Do not buy this product if you need to use the mouse for graphics."
2,Pocket Reference for Writers with 2001 APA Guidelines,The manual is not up to date. The current format when referencing titles is that they are to be writen in italics not underlined. This is not mentioned in this manual.
5,I love this! Write more!,"This series (Gate of Ivory, Two-Bit Heroes, & Guilt-Edged Ivory) has a wonderful, almost stream of conciousness tone. The heroine's world-view comes through crystal clear. Doris Egan builds an incredibly rich world. Really, REALLY good!!"
5,Great!,"I love this stroller! Of the 8 other single and double strollers that I own, this is the only stroller I use reguarly. I love that my almost 4 year old can stand on the back in a parking lot or when he gets tired of walking and doesn't disturb his 2 year old sister at all. I have no problems with opening or closing it and is easy to manuveur with one hand, a coffee in the other and 2 kids. The basket is small, but you can shove a ton of stuff in it if you put it in from the side. I have gone to Target and was even able to get a thing of cat litter in the bottom as well as other items. Customer service is also great! On a trip last year, the airline The tore the hood even though it was checked at the gate. since it was only a month old, they relaced it for free! This is a great purchase!!"
3,good for tall people,"I bought this for the quality and reviews I had read online. If I had to do it again, I wouldn't spend the money on this stroller.Pros:Graco Snug Ride fits realatively wellsmooth rideadjustable handles for tall parentsbig canopyremoveable snack trayCons:wider wheel base (difficult to maneuver in tight store aisles)small basket that is difficult to accessdoes not fold with one hand as advertisedexpensive"
4,"Safe, Sturdy and Comfy stroller","When I purchase this stroller, I have a few things that I considered. First, Color. I like the color of this stroller, at least not the same as everyone else and also this is a neutral color that fits for both baby boy or girl. Second: sturdiness This is made of aluminium and it is very sturdy but relatively light weight (~19 lb). Size and Comfy: The seat is generous and you do not feel restricted in the seat. In general, I think I have a good investment given I do not need to spend as much as a Bugagoo or Orbit."
4,Living History,"Giving an overview of the lives of Sam and Abigail Adams, Ben Franklin, George Washington, and others involved in the War for Independence, this book is good supplemental reading for an elementary school student learning our nation's history. It covers the reasoning behind the Revolution and other facts. However, it is written to emphasize the every day struggles and personalities of these great men, using plenty of quotes which enables them to tell their own stories. The chapters are short and filled with enough variety to keep a child's attention as a read-aloud book."
1,"Poor production values, not enough of Jane & Christopher","This video appears to be a slapdash capture of a tour performance given by Torvil and Dean in the company of a group of Russian professional skaters. The video and sound quality are poor and there is far too much ""filler"" skating by the Russians while Jane and Chris are changing costumes, relaxing, whatever."
2,They were not presnet much!!,I wanted to see Torvill & Dean perform but they did very little dancing in this vhs tape. Disappointed! Donated it to charity.
2,Chen Style video learning,"The DVD is just okay. After viewing it the first time, I realized how important it is to train and practice in person."
1,Not worth the money,"I was amazed he didnt even ""teach"" just performed, I being doing chen tai chi for only 2 years now and I could make a better DVD, he didnt teach what he should have, breathing, stance, basics, etc. its like watching a youtube video of a performance rather than someone showing you how, not worth the money, I have bought dvds in the past of tai chi, for 10 each and is packed of hours of content.Dont get me wrong, Master Ren is amazing at what he does and i have much respect for his skills but I expected more for the money I paid, not a 10 min demonstration"
4,Irish / English,Excellant book telling the story of the love and saddness in Anglo/Irish relationships
2,"Fortune cookie say, ""Have hernia in head to buy book""","I love a good ""who done it"", and its even better if it adds a little humor. But come on! This story had more loose ends then a ball of yarn that my cat Socks just finished with. Tamar introduces a character and then they disappear. She starts a story line and then stops it. She uses more worn out phrases then 14 grandmothers at a AARP meeting. I did get a laugh here and there, but most of the story was spent trying to understand the lastest branch of her tree. a couple of the sub-characters are ok, the police chief never develops, her sister never develops and the deal with her husband already being married just lays there. Summing it up. A good idea for story line, too many weak characters, and too many side trips. I do have to say that a book is like a work of art, some people love it, some hate it and a few like myself would rather have had eggroll."
3,A hit-and-run mystery,"Magdelena Yoder has always been the nemesis of police chief Melvin Stoltzfus. It might have something to do with the fact that she tends to solve crimes before he does. In this addition to the Pennsylvania Dutch Mystery series, Melvin decides since he can't beat her, he'll ask her to join him. Magdelena is called upon to be a temporary deputy in order to help Melvin solve the murder of an Asian visitor who has been strangled and then run over by an Amish buggy. Magdelena has her usual group of interesting guests at the PennDutch Inn and they are suspects along with some local teenage boys who love to drive their buggies around town late at night. She is unwittingly aided by her father-in-law who is in search of aliens and flying saucers and who helps her uncover some important evidence. This one is a bit thin as to the plot, and the murderer's motive is pretty shaky, but it's still good fun if you're a ""cozy"" fan."
5,A great book,"In this one Mags's husband is away while trouble is stirring up in Herina. Mags is a talented detective, but can she eat her way this one? Read it to find out!"
3,Frustrating,"It's clear MMW knows their audience and relentlessly plays to it. They've got their formula down, and they rarely stray. Too bad. Medeski, at least, has good chops, and he's done some neat things on his non-MMW projects, but every time they come close to breaking loose or developing an interesting idea, they back off. Not bad for background to a party, but nothing to listen seriously to."
1,Serious Letdown,"I'm a fan of MMW, but this album is really awful. The grooves are dull and repetitive, and the tracks never, ever go anywhere. I just don't see how any MMW fan who has enjoyed Tonic, Friday Afternoon, Notes, Dropper, really anything but the remix + greatest hits albums, can tolerate this stale crap. Essential for the unimaginative listener, or those who think MMW is a hippie groove band rather than a creative jazz trio."
1,"good cd, rude band","I like this ccd alot. It is too bad to hear about how good these guys are live: I won tickets to see them in LA and they cancelled 20 minutes before the show because they ""didnt feel like playing there."" We had driven an hour each way to get to the club. Needless to say, it soured me on buying any more of their stuff."
5,Simply Amazing,BUY THIS ALBUM!! It is the best MMW CD to date. Billy Martin is one of the most talented drummers in the business today. John Medeski has some of the most unique and interesting ogran/piano sounds ever to be heard. Chris Wood is also outstandig from start to finish.p.s. If these guys ever come to your town do yourself a favor and check them out. They are an amazing live band.
3,DEAD - Not the Carolyn Sullivan classic,"Okay compilation, but if you were hoping to be getting a copy of the classic ""Dead"" by Carolyn Sullivan, this isn't it. It appears to be the original backing instrumental track with someone else's voice dubbed over it plus a slight change in the lyric. Cresa Watson was listed as ""aka Carolyn Sullivan"" on other websites listing this recording, but this track is a rip-off. The real version was re-issued on ""Batteria For The Beatheads, Vol. III (vinyl) a couple of years ago but seems to be out of print now."
2,Short and sloppily made...,"I've been playing guitar for 46 years and have owned many guitars and many straps. I bought this strap hoping I was going to get a nice leather strap for a decent price. You know, like in the olden days? Well, it's not well made and it is shorter than any strap I've ever purchased. I had to cut out the strap pin hole (on the end that shows) to put it on the guitar and adjust the strap out as long as I could and it's still not quite long enough. Unless you are a tiny person who wants to save some money on a padded leather strap, spend a little more and get something better."
3,Kiss Kiss,"This is definitely something you'd want to be Kissing After Dark to; the selctions were beautiful. However I was a bit disappointed because there are just so many more songs by so many more artists that I would have preferred to be on this CD. Maybe that is what the problem is: so many selections, so little room. A Kissing After Dark volume 2 would also be cherished. *hint hint*"
4,TALENT SHOW JAMS,"they could've thrown in some more jams like: You're A Big Girl Now, No More Daddy's Little Girl, Where Have All The Flowers Gone?, You Got Me Goin'In Circles""My Ebony Princess was a major song in Brooklyn when it came out. There's a lot of crucial jams that never made it south nor west. This is a decent compilation, but it could be better. I keep looking for the ultimate rare isolated grooves, that have been neglected for so long.We used to have talent shows when I was a little kid. My cousin Derrick was the falsetto and I (the only girl in the group) hit all the notes to compliment him. The older boys took care of the rest. Music was the center of our universe back then, and talent shows were serious business, with no money involved... just a love of music."
4,Learning from a fatal experience,"Tompkins offers us a unique insight into the events which led to the space shuttle disaster. By offering examples from this very real and painful event, he illustrates the significance of some of the basic principles of effective organizational communication. A terrific book for students in the org. comm. field, as well as managers."
1,Poor,"I don't know why I read this book, which I was aware was inspired by the famous movie, which in turn was inspired by a French novel written in 1959. Nevertheless, I can tell you why you shouldn't bother: It is most dull in its literalness and occasional spikes of melodrama."
4,Gotta love that vibe,"I love this cd. Totally chill, even with their (sometimes loud) sound experimentation. This album was my introduction to Medeski Martin & Wood, and it made me a big fan."
2,say huh???,"Just for starters, I am an avid MMW fan, and I need everyone thinking about getting an MMW album to think about this......DONT start with this one.....I have a real hard time understanding the other reviewers because to me, this is the least comprehensive album of their genius ever put out by them(I have every MMW release). Im not saying its bad, but if you want the best start with Uninvisible, Combustication, or End of the world party (if you dig grand piano, go with Tonic)....the other reviews are totally mad. Claiming that this is the most inspired and round about album they ever made is like saying the Beatles made better albums before Revolver.....take it from someone who has seen MMW five times in three years and skip this one for next to last (last being Shackman) However, I am not so corny to think Im always right, and in dealing with jazz albums, it is totally subjective as to what is the best...."
3,You get what you pay for (plastic top),"This was about $5 when we bought it. The photo looks awesome, but when we got the stockings we were disappointed. Only the fishnet part is cloth; the top white band (part) is actually plastic and doesn't look that great (it's weird to me when I look at it#. Overall, you get what you pay for #my girlfriend didn't end up using it and bought another pair of fishnet stockings)."
3,great stockings but not what I expected,"Was hoping for a pvc topper, but has elastic in the back, which is just unattractive and doesn't work as well as just the plain old pvc holding itself up."
2,$250.00 MORE,"Eleven months ago, this machine sold for $850.00. Comparably, Nikon Lenses in this price range have only gone up $40.00. I will not pay a $250.00 price mark up in only eleven months and I suggest you do what I'm going to do, sharpen up your scrapers!"
2,"Average sander, ridiculously expensive to operate","This sander works fine enough, but not great. For the cost, it should perform considerably better. The cost of operating it, however, is absolutely ridiculous. The sanding strips are roughly $7.50 per strip MINIMUM and when you have to replace the conveyor belt, you will pay a MINIMUM of $72. I bought a conveyor belt 3 months ago for $34 and went to get another to have as a 'stand-by'. Best price I can find now is $72. I would NOT have bought this sander knowing that Performax-Jet-Powermatic (WMH Tool Group) would rip-off their customers like this. This has seriously soured my opinion of Performax-Jet-Powermatic (WMH Tool Group). Buyer beware!"
5,Amazing Time Saver,"How did I get along without it? The set-up manual was so simple to follow, and the tracking set-up was a cinch - With-in an hour of receiving the sander, it was up and running. I cannot begin to tell you how much time I am saving by using this sander for newly glued-up table tops, side panels, etc. Thanks to my 16-32+ Performax, I can spend less time hand-sanding, and more time in the 'creative' indeavors of my woodworking shop making items for my grandchildren. I can't believe that I waited so long to purchase this fantastic sander."
4,so far so good,"Having owned both the Performax and the Delta drum sanders, as well as using a cabinet shop size Performax at school, this Performax performs well for the money. I like the drum height adjusting instead of the table, because supporting the wood as it travels through the machine is VERY important. If the ends sag even a little, you will see a mark in the stock. I can control this aspect easier with a stationary base. Snipe is almost gone with the proper adjustments, depending on how fussy you are. To get a truly glass finish requires a little hand sanding regardless of which machine you choose, because a drum sander leaves straight lines of abrasions. The height adjusting crank could be more precise as there is about one eighth of a turn before it moves the drum, but you get used to it. The optional infeed-outfeed tables are a mixed bag as my review on them states. All in all, the sander is a good buy for a small shop."
5,Great for hardwood!,We bought this when we got a big job building kitchen cabinets out of hickory. Since hickory is such a hard wood the planer just doesn't do the job without biting. My husband loves this drum sander. It may take a while to get down to the correct thickness necessary but it gives a uniform finish. He has replaced the belts without any problems and is REALLY pleased with that aspect of the product.
3,Wandering Conveyor Belt,"The sander does the job for which it is made, BUT the sander I have has a definite conveyor tracking problem. All set-up directions were followed and all possible belt tension settings have been tried, but the belt still has a mind of its own. I can position the conveyor belt completely to the motor side tracker and after only 2 minutes 10 seconds running, with no load, time at full speed it has drifted to the extreme position against the tracker away from the motor. Support from the manufacturer, so far, only repeated the printed instructions."
4,"Excellent sander, poor stand","The sander is great. The instructions were clear and I had no problems in setting it up. However, the stand must have designed and manufacture by a tribe of drunken Howler Monkies. Nothing fit. I had to drill out six holes to get the bolts through. The legs in the stand made the wheels totally out of alignment. I had to install a plywood base to align the wheels and be able to roll the machine. Kudos on the machine, you must look for another sub to build the stand."
3,Snapshot at a year and a half,After a year and a half review:Today I put new Helicoil threads in the main adjusting yoke. It is made ot of potmetal and does not do well after a short period of time. It sits at the heart of this machine and it's shortcoming is a slap in the face when it happens. You look at it and say Duh?!! Of course this will go bad. For everyone else that has this problem Helicoil 5/8 - 18 threads per inch. You can actually do this while the machine is assembled. Just take out the adjusting shaft set screw collar and unscrew the crank. Now you can work from the top. The spindle bearings are also beginning to get noisy. This tool has had light to moderate use. All things considered I wish I would have taken a longer look at the Delta version of this tool.
5,How did I live without one?,"There isn't a tremendous amount that I can add that hasn't been said, but I can tell you that I'm a little ticked off. I'm mad at myself for living without a good thickness sander for so many years. I'm thrilled with the machine - use it for what it was designed for and it will treat you right. Tracking of the conveyor is not tough if you don't try an ""over correct"". It takes a time or two to get used to putting on the sandpaper, but once you've got it, it only takes a couple of minutes.Taking light passes with 80 grit gives me a nice surface but still easily removes planer or bandsaw marks. I tripped the reset only once while trying it out and have put gobs of board feet through since and never had it happen again. With a cheap bicycle hook hung from the ceiling, you can hang your dust collector hose and it's out of your way and works great. When done, there is very little dust and it gets put away clean."
4,Jet 16-32 Drum Sander,"This product is a welcomed addition to my woodworking shop. Although I've used this for a only short time while completing a chest of drawers, it easily provided a smooth and flat surface. My only critique - and this could be the result of a novice's operator error - is having the drum roller maintain parallel with the bed while finishing surfaces greater than 12"" wide. Frequent re-adjustments were required. Not a big deal but for me, it does require monitoring."
5,Great commentary for the Bible,Great dictionary. Very interesting read with the bible. I like the information when I can't understand certain words or need a better insight to the real meaning of words.
4,"Holy Rolling Batman, you won't find this CD in stores!","This unreleased CD took more than 7 days to create by S.F.'s God of Trance, Phil B. DJ Phil B is incredibly talented, however it is not put to its best use with the tracks selected this time around. But, if you like Phil B's music and want to keep a ""truly"" complete set of his CD's then you should get it. I have it and yes, I do listen to it occasionally. So there. Now call your mother & tell her you love her!"
5,Romantic and pensive,"This CD has been one of the favorites in our home for almost 20 years. I have learned that the piano concertos are early works by Chopin composed when Chopin was around 20 years old and composed before he left his native land of Poland.I have read that Chopin was not fully comfortable with the orchestra, either as performer or composer, however that is certainly never evident in this work. Chopin's mature work focuses more on the solo piano, but these early works are delightful and romantic."
1,Product Misrepresented,"The bed skirt shown on the web site is not the bed skirt I received. I was extremely disappointed and immediately returned it. I am still waiting for a refund which, I am told, may take weeks. I was required to pay in advance for the product, but now my money is being held hostage for for four weeks for merchandise I didn't order."
3,GREED AND SHAME!,"Although I've studied the DSS for some years now (25 years) I do have problem's with the publisher's and writer's who go into ""a little more detail"" on the subject that I already know and studied. To charge such very high prices for the hardcover as well as the paperback versions of these books purely for greed making it very hard for frist time student's to purchase these books for themselve's. I've had alot of mail from them asking ""why????"". I only can tell them that the writer, publishers are only interested in filling their ""pockets"" with alot money on a subject that should be available to them and also the public for a reasonable price. Shame on them for keeping these ""must read"" documents out of their reach for greed. M.A. BREGAN- Professor of theology."
5,AMAZING. Full length club mixes...,"of most of the songs on this CD, NOT segued together. These are some really big tracks from the mid-90s dance club scene, many of which were never available on CD--or at all for that matter, including a ten minute junior vasquez mix of the final track on disc 2. Now that I discovered this CD, I wish I could find volumes 1&2, which were the same in terms of being full length mixes of early 90s house music not available elsewhere on CD. Unfortunately, volumes 4 & 5 made the foolish mistake of cramming about 20 songs on each disc, segued together, and running from between only 2-3 minutes. SPG had a great thing going with this series until then."
3,Great car with one problem,"My son received this car for his first birthday and has loved it ever since (he turns two next month). He LOVES pushing it around, getting in and out of it, scooting around in it and getting pushed around in it. I was super disappointed when last week the front swivel wheels that are hidden underneath the car broke off. First one and then the next day the other one. The car is still functional with the four wheels on it but what made the car so easy to manuever was the swivel wheels underneath. I am going to contact the manufacturer to see if anything can be done.Radio Flyer Classic Red Car"
4,Great first push and ride in toy.,"I bought this toy for my son's first birthday. It is more challenging to put together than a lot of things and i needed my husbands help attaching the first two wheels. The instructions are easy to follow though, it just needed a little more strength. Once together it looks great and feels very sturdy and durable. My son is tall for his age but at 13 months cannot quite reach the floor sat in the toy, so he still needs to be pushed around, which he loves. The handle at the back is the right height for him to push the toy along. He is still growing into this toy and i think he will like it more and more for quite some time to come."
2,Unclear if this book is a good resource or not,"As a previous reviewer pointed out, some rather simple mistakes on the 10th problem (not corrected in the 1985ed, btw) cast a shadow on the reliability of this book. Many other problems seem to be worked out correctly, but it's beyond me to check every one. The book is helpful in spots, but the fact that they answered ""105%"" for ""What percent of 100 is 99.5?"" leaves me more than a bit unsure of their subsequent answers. As a math teacher, I would suggest a basic textbook instead of this (you'll have graphics anyway, which are critical to understanding math well)."
1,Might never read it after opening,"Its thickness of about 1,000 pages made it intimidating.Its small font made it monotonous.You might never read it after opening it up and flipping to see whats in the pages."
3,dismal forebodings,"What can you say about a book whose answer to the 10th problem, ""What percent of 100 is 99.5?"" is 105%, and to ""what percent of 4 is 200"" is 2%?"
2,disappointment,"sure it is somewhat helpful but in limited terms.I have come across solved algebra and precalculus books sold for Turkish college students. I recommend these excellent books written by Nesime Aydn, Kerim Yeniay, Hasan Özer, Mevlut Gündodu, Emrullah Eraslan to math-lovers all around the world because the math language is universal and the books are written an easy fashion to follow the steps in any way."
2,Too small for little hands,"I suggest using this for middle school or older if they're desparate. I have unique coloring pages for my elementary art room as a choice after work. They had some difficulty with it. Of course, Matisse is always fun, I think I'll just take this home for myself :)"
3,Very general information for listeners.,"Don't expect to learn much more about various sound files than their names and the operating systems they operate with.Very little information of value for musicians and composers.Contains a CD that is out of date now, but is still of value in that it tells you about some player, converter, etc. software that is updatable on the internet."
4,Exciting. influences. madness,"Great disc. Combines jazz influences with surf, noise, rock, etc. Exciting at times, melodic too. All the renditions of classic Mancini tunes do justice. Check out ""A Shot in the Dark"" and ""Mr. Yunoshi"" for fast paced stuff, but there's variety. Only problem: on one or two songs they indulge in Sonic-Youth-esque noise that distract the listener from the overall song. but don't let that stop you. Check this out. Plus, one of the band members is Dave Brubeck's son! But there's not much of a musical resemblance. A fun CD, unabashedly cheesey at times (Peter Gunn meets Baby Elephant Walk for the finale. Hilarious and entertaining). Think Jazz meets Laika and the Cosmonauts meets Morphine. Enjoy! David Brodie"
1,Hit & Miss Mancini,"The album is hit & miss. Some of the tracks are interesting (Moon River and Baby Elephant/Peter Gunn), the rest is a little hard to follow. But it was fun to listen to their take on all the Mancini hits."
4,Bratz are beautiful!,The only issue with the doll is that the arm ripped off with a 3yr old and we couldn't repair it. So we had to purchase another one. All in all its a good item.
5,Princess for a princess,I purchased this doll for a birthday present for a niece. She loved it and for her age (6) it was a great fit. I know there a a bit of controversy amoung adults about these dolls but the doll was actually very cute.
5,Princess for a princess,My 2-yo daughter is really prissy and has recently wanted to comb my hair. To save myself some pain I bought her this doll! She loves it! She bathes with it and takes it everywhere. It does have some small parts that I have put away but other than that - GREAT!
2,a pretty doll..nothing so special,"My little girl is obsessed with bratz, so i thought it would be a good idea to buy this big bratz baby. She hasn't looked at it twice since christmas. My child is eight, so the princess motif is a turnoff to her. She prefers dolls that wear clothes that she sees in everyday life, as do most girls nowadays. unless your child is still in the imaginary stages of play...like 3 to 5 years-old, this doll won't hold her attention."
3,Patio Roofs & Gazebos,"Helpful information, but not as good as ""Gazebos & Other Structures"". I'm not sure that the editors actually have built any of the structures described. Lots of cutesy California designs. Great photos of construction techniques, some of which could be challenged."
2,Larger than they appear....,"These are just too big for my ears which makes them incredibly uncomfortable. I tried trimming down so they didn't have so much of the earplug sticking out of my ear but it was still not comfortable. If you don't have a problem with ear buds you might be fine with these but if you have smaller ears that don't accommodate ear buds, then you probably won't find these comfortable, either. This would otherwise have been a good deal, price-wise, but now I have to buy another box of earplugs. Oh well."
1,Not as good as I thought!,This book has one or two very good articles but the rest are not worth the expense.
5,Tenganlo en sus casas. Es un Amigo!!!,"Y no solo en sus casas, llevenlo al trabajo en la cajuela del coche. Un buen consejero es muy dificil de encontrar en estos dias - sin magnificar-. Es de esos libros que nos invitan a subrayar, y que despues de un tiempo terminan todo subrayado. Algo importante antes de terminar, ""sentido comun solo eso, nada mas ni nada menos Sentido Comun"".Dificil Nooo!!! leanlo! y despues me cuentan."
5,Aunque parezca que todo esta perdido siempre existe una nueva oportunidad.,Sopa de pollo para el alma: relatos que conmueven el corazón y ponen fuego en el espíritu
1,"un libro tonto, y comercial","esto es lo ultimo, se supone que debes ser tocado por estas historias, casi vomito al leer cosas tan cursis e insipidas y me pongo a pensar en todo el dinero que se estan ganando los que se dedican a recopilar esta clase de cuentecitos para gente debil y sonsa, y pienso como traman uno, dos, tres y creo que ya van por la parte seis y sigo pensando en la estupidez de la gente o es tal vez falta de comunicacion o que se yo. lei la primera copia y lo regale inmediatamente antes de que me vieran con el. es uno de esos libros que me avergonzaria de tener, como las novelitas rosas o las historias de corin tellado. pero que le vamos a hacer mientras haya mundo existira mercado para esta basura ideologica...LUIS MENDEZ luismendez@codetel.net.do"
1,Do not buy this seat cover,"I purchased this product a week ago.I am in the heating and cooling industry ,in and out of the van all the time,also I travel all the time from customer to customer.DO NOT PURCHASE this cover,it is falling apart after a week in use..the fishing line that holds the beads together is poorly woven .The beads are separating from the line ."
1,Poor Quality Item,"The quality of this item is extreamly poor. I have 3 of them that are falling apart after 30 days use in 2 different cars. The metal on the rim is all bent out of shape. The fish line on the beads is coming apart. The fish line is sticking me in the back, The construction of this iten is poor. If I could return all 3 and get a refund, I would. I cannot recommend this item to anyone."
1,Woven rattan surround fell apart quickly,"I bought these seat-covers, hoping to avoid the summer unpleasantness of sitting on my car's original vinyl seats.After about 1 months' use, the woven edging surrounding the beads began to deteriorate, and shed pieces everywhere :-( I swapped passenger <=> driver covers, and made it through the summer before the second one similarly deteriorated, shed, and generally fell apart (only the outer surrounding woven edge fell apart, not the center bead area).Previously, I had used the larger bead-only covers, and they lasted several years (until the fishing-line string for the bead began breaking). I had hoped for longer life from these covers. I'm a pretty careful person, and at 6'0"" and 175lbs, I don't think I'm ""oversize"" for this product.On the plus side: they *did* provide relief from the summer vinyl-stickiness.However, both my covers are in the trash, just a few short months after purchase :-( Thumbs down for this product."
2,Bead & Rattan seat cover,"Have used a beaded seat for years. Helps with back ache. Can't find them in local stores anymore so decided tocheck out Amazon. The rattan seat still will not conform to my seat and have used it for more than a month.Still feels stiff and hard to adjust. So I'll pass on to my daughter, plan to order one that has material aroundthe edges, this is the type I've always used. So lesson learned!"
4,Wagan IN9912 Bead and Rattan Cool Seat Cover,"I bought 2, one for each car. The price is good and they did what I wanted which is to keep my back cool. Only problem is they do not fasten well on the car seats. Over time the nylon strings got strained and some started breaking in about a year's time but still functional. I think I got my money's worth."
1,Wagon Rattan Seat Cover,"The seat was uncomfortable, mainly because it could not be secured in place and did not fit my car seat. I took it out."
5,Works well,"I have trouble with my legs ""going to sleep"" on long trips. So far I've used this beaded seat cover on two trips involving all-day driving each way, and have had no problems with my legs. The beaded surface takes a little getting used to, but after the first 20-30 minutes of driving it actually became quite comfortable. The seat cover slides around on the seat, making it a little awkward getting in and out of the car, but that is the only problem I experienced.Some have complained about poor construction, but so far I have had no problems. I would buy this item again."
3,rattan seat cushion/cooler,"This is a great idea, not well executed. the look with the rattan is perfect for my 1948 dodge, but it is so flimsy it folds all up on itself. I feel like pinning it to the back of the front seat! Not that the back drops down to the seat, but the back folds in half after some use. It does keep me cooler as it lifts me off the wool upholstory and gives added support to the sagging 63 year old seats. love the color. Could be more encompassing in a more muted color for more sedate interiors of the period."
1,Bad choice,Buying this cover was my big mistake. It has fallen apart approx. one month after installing!!!!!!!!The previous cover was similiar and last for only 3 months.
1,This actually cost me over $300 and came apart in 9 days,First off Amazon packed this thing in a massive sized box. So when my skybox had to ship this to the Caribbean everything cost me $300 USSecondly it came apart in 9 days. It was also way to small and never covered any part of the chair more like 50% dont let the size on the pic fool you this thing is for a child.Rubbish!!!
2,My seat isn't that cool . . .,"Another hot day, and I'm sitting on my Bead and Rattan Cool Seat cover.Sadly, it doesn't provide the relief I'd hoped for. It's just not that comfortable or cool. It's better than no cover at all, but not by a lot.Also, as other reviewers--who I bought in spite of--reported, the fising line that the beads are strung on is, after a couple of weeks, starting to come loose.I'm now in the market for another seatcover for my overly-warm desk chair."
1,Too Cheap!,"This item is was not worth my time or money. True, it was inexpensive, but this thing will not stay in place on the driver sear of a Civic, and it is too light-weight to do much in the way of adding comfort. It's like putting tissue over the seat. On day one, one of the wooden balls that you sit on cracked! Not recommended at any price."
5,Try something new!,I love this setting of the Ceremony of Carols. Now I have a local group that has done a fantastic job with it. I am going to be a follower of this group. They are headed to big things!!!
5,Great 2 fer Release,"This is a two CD release. One is an excellent live disc, the other is his first release ""Road to Indio"". This is the only way to obtain this long out of print release. I think that it is not as strong as some of his later day work (Mi Vida Loca & Loser's Paradise) but an excellent release non the less (just a notch below those two classics). With the passing of Chris earlier this year there sadly will be no more tours. If you never saw him live pick this up and see what you missed. If you were fortunate enough to see him live then you'll want this as well because you already know what a fantastic live performer he was."
2,Does not contain the Justice rmx of skitzo dancer,I took a risk on purchasing this hoping it would have the Justice rmx of skitzo dancer. It doesn't--just so other dj's looking for this track know.
2,Doesn't hold the heat!,"I had high hopes for this product, especially given the premium price. It arrived very quickly from the seller and with excellent packaging. However, usage has been very disappointing ... it just doesn't hold the heat very long, and certainly not for a 20 minute therapeutic session.I rarely write reviews, but felt strongly enough about this product that I wanted to warn others hoping to find relief from chronic neck pain."
1,Ouch,"I bought this disc hoping that it might turn me on to Ives. It was highly recommended by the Penguin Guide, so it should be a safe bet, right? Well, this disc may be an outstanding recording of Ives, but I have learned something very important through listening to this disc...I don't like Ives.Sorry."
5,cool,lyrical flames that is all i can say not sizzla or capleton or damian but fire none the less more of a dancehall flow type of vibe heare nothing deep or spiritual just hype and danceable but hey that works also.
1,Received package is terrible.,"The page said the key chain will be packaged with Regal Blue Sueded-Cloth Pouch. But When I received the package, the key chain was in dirty plastic-film bag which was encapsulated in 2 piece of cardboard. Whatever the quality of key chain was good or not, the package had scared me. I am thinking whether I should return this key chain."
5,this stuff is great!!!,"tried it once on vacation after forgetting my usual brand at home.loved it so much I bought 2 bottles first chance and no longer use any other conditioner or styling product.I have very fine curly hair and this is not sticky or flaky AND works great in both dry windy and hot damp weather.moisten your hair the next day and finger style, still looks curly and fresh.EXTRA BONUS: my ends had started breaking recently, and after less than 6 weeks using this product, no more breakage...sweet:)"
4,Yip.,"Different from previous Download releases ... less industrial, more distinctly techno-oriented, with a more mellow atmosphere than The Eyes of Stanley Pain. I think there are some new people involved in the project on this album ... and no Genesis P'Orridge! That alone puts it a few rungs up the ladder. Admittedly, though, I miss some of the noisier squelchiness of the previous albums."
2,wake me up when it's over,"I'm really suprised to see all the positive feedback that this cd received. After getting furnace and microscopic, I was expecting more of the abrasive, nerve-grating sound that this crew is known for. Instead, we get a bunch of hypnotic, mellow tracks with no real beauty to be found anywhere. I'm a fan of mellow electronic music, but this just doesn't make the cut IMHO. Everytime I put it on, it kind of just faded into background music for me. Something that the Download of 1995-96 would never be able to do."
2,Download continues to surprise!,"This time they're big surprise is: a boring, repetitive CD. None of the tracks are mind blowing, and only a few of them are alright. I don't recommend this even to Download fans. It sounds like a run-down dance club after closing hours... I don't know what to say, my favorite band let me down with this one!"
5,Skinny Puppy music you can dance to...,"I love Skinny Puppy, but every once in awhile I feel apart from their music. With their vocals and their instruments seeming to be making two different songs, you seldom want to even tap your foot. Instead, you want to curl into a fetal position and die.Download changes that. It has all the awesome layered music, except it has a beat. And sometimes its not depressing. Oh my!III is Download's best. Others before it seem too random and noisy, while Effector seems a little too synth-pop. It's the balance between chaos and order."
3,Amusing sidestep,"Although I would hesistate to call this album a masterpiece, it is definitely a solid electronica album. Most Skinny Puppy /Download fans will scratch their heads or turn their noses up at this one, but electronica fans outside the cult following may enjoy this one very much. I debated whether to call this a ""misstep"" instead of a ""sidestep,"" but I think Key and co. knew what they were doing, and according to the wire, they'll be returning to form with their new release, Effector. Personally, I thought it was a refreshing change, but it came off as more of a side project album, so I can only give it three stars."
1,One of the worst CD's I've ever bought,"Being a big fan of cEvin Keys previous involvements with bands such as Skinny Puppy and The Tear Garden, I rushed out and blindly bought this CD. Maybe my expectations were a little high. I knew this band was experimental but they went a little too far. I'd have to be on a severe dose of acid to enjoy this release. I used to think I could get into anything...."
5,Great value for use between hair coloring.,"I purchased this because it was less costly than what I was buying from Sephora, which was usually out of stock. The color is effective, I have to reinforce that one must shake the can and apply to your hair roots, you may want to use your hand to blend in the color so it will look more natural. Great to use between colors/ highlightings. I will buy again."
3,It's all right...,"The product isn't very effective unless you have extremely light hair to begin with. It basically just adds a slight gold shimmer to your existing hair color, but it doesn't actually make the hair look blonde unless you're already blonde to begin with. Personally, I wouldn't purchase it again."
4,Belkin Holster Case For Zune,"I had purchased one of these cases for my original Zune and when I bought a second I was glad that I could still find this particular case. Great case, protects the Zune, I would highly recommend this case to owners of the Zune 30."
4,Good basic case,"I have had this case for about a year. I do not use it everyday. It protects nicely. The window is clear. You have to get used to pushing the buttons with the cover on, no big deal. You just have to make sure it is pushed down in the case so the buttons line up with the spots on the case. Clips on belt. Basic black and gray, thick enough to give a bit of cushion."
2,Too difficult to use my zune after I put it on ... it makes zune looks so heavy,Too difficult to use my zune after I put it on ... it makes zune looks so heavy. I like other Belkin products as there quality is really good but this one not worth it.
1,Absolute waste of money,"I am an great Don Knotts fan and thought I'd try this. I assumed it would be part clips, part documentary. Do not waste your money. A few skits from his old variety show. Generally poor skits at that and some are of Joey Heatherton and Knotts isn't even in the skit!. A five minute skit of Knotts singing with Jimmy Durante was worth watching as was a five minute nervous man skit. The other 50 minutes was so bad I fast forwarded through most. If you could get your money back on DVD's you've watched, this would be headed back!"
4,Saturn LW2 Owner's Manual,"Some times you just can't figure something out by yourself. I bought a used 2000 Saturn wagon, and of course there was no manual. I ordered a replacement (used) and as usual received it very quickly. I now have a complete hardbound manual on all I need to know regarding the care and feeding of my car. This was an excellent bargain."
1,UNHAPPY - BEWARE,"There were no return instructions. The condition of the violin, bow and case was very poor. The sound; there was no sound. It should be a law against junk like this. I am still waiting on my refund."
3,All Around Town - Photographs of Richard Samuel Roberts,"Great photos. Would have preferred more of a story line and also a few extra photos from the author. Excellent historical piece. Richard Samuel Roberts is my great uncle and after viewing the book The Black South of Richard Samuel Roberts it is difficult not comparing that superb compilation with other books. Of course the cost is much higher for that reason; so for much less money, this All Around Town book is a good one."
4,Great for everyday use,"If you are the kind of player that plays 2-3 times per week with friends, this is for you. Enough space for 2-3 raquets, additional compartments for your fresh bottle of water/gatorade, keys, cell phone, extra gear, additional bags for shoes and dirt clothes, etc."
1,Piece of junk,"Do not buy this. I bought this seat a while ago, to be ready when my son got ready. He's started to show signs, so I excitedly got the seat out so he could sit on it and get comfortable. Unfortunately, the hinges which hold the seat to the base are junk. They pop off, and the entire seat slides off the base--along with my son. The whole thing is made of very weak plastic. The seat is very unstable on the base and makes a lot of popping, creaking noise, which scares my son--not very conducive to potty training."
4,hole too small,"this is a nice potty chair. it was made with good intentions. the step stool is nice, and the seat converts to fit on an adult toilet. it has potential but needs improvement. the hole is way too small, and the pee gaurd pulls off too easily! I guess it is better for girls, as they obviously do not need pee gaurds, but if you have a normal to large size 2 year old and they do not position themselves just right, they will have a great experience turn dreadfully bad. my son was very excited to tell me he had to use the bathroom, we made it to the bathroom and got the clothes off just in time to sit on the potty chair and nothing made it in the bowl because it went on the seat instead! my son was so upset, he thought he did something wrong. I praised him anyway...as it was not his fault. we bought a soft seat to just fit over out toilet, and use this one as a step stool only!"
2,Seat hole to small,I didn't like this seat for my son because the little thing in the front to keep boys from peeing everywhere was so hard I was afraid he was going to hurt his boy hood on it. I found another seat that had a soft rubber gard on the front. I also didnt like that the seat hole was so small. I know kids have small dums but geez this things hole is so.
4,This is a good choice!,"We have used this potty for 3 years with two children, one boy and one girl. I have tried other potty's and they were a leaky mess. This potty is stable, has a lid to put down if you can't empty it immediately and it resembles a real toilet. I don't use the cup for my son. I have found that it is easier not to. The only real complaint I have is there is a plastic grid in the bottom and if the potty spills it is a bit of a pain to clean. All in all I am satisfied with this one and I just bought another for a spare!"
2,"OK, but there are better options!","WE got this as a ""trainer"" for our 2-year-old. It's very unstable for daily use - she would sit down and sometimes it would tip forward! The lid would lean forward and rest on her back, which she found annoying, so instead of concentrating on her ""business"", she was too busy fighting with the lid of the potty seat!BUT, we do use this! When we go on a longer than bladder car trip, we throw this in the back of the car and she can go in the potty that's in a controlled area (the trunk of my SUV) and not use public toilets! Just empty and your ready to continue on down the road!For daily use, however, we found a that a seat (WITH handles!!!) that fits on the adult toilet worked much better as far as stability, space (no need to find a clear space on the floor of the bathroom) and convienence!"
2,Not Stable,"My 2.5 yo is totally potty trained now - trained at day care, not at home. She never felt comfortable on this potty - the two pieces don't secure together and most times she sat down, the whole thing came apart. But, she loves the step-stool part and the potty seat on the regular toilet. The handles are nice, she climbs up to the toilet by herself and steadies herself holding the handles. This design is very sub-par when used as a stand-alone potty. I like that it has a lid to close so we can keep it on the toilet in her bathroom and keep the lid down."
1,What a disappointment!,"I bought this potty chair trusting the Safety First name. What a disappointment! My daughter is 20 months old and 23 pounds. She is interested in sitting on the potty but she is intimidated with the design of this chair. When she sits down, she is not heavy enough to ""anchor"" it and it often tips forward on her. When the chair tips, the seat closes on her back and annoys her. Needless to say, our time on the potty is short-lived."
2,This thing is a peice of junk!,I gave it 2 stars(don't like it) only because I got rid of it before I could grow to hate it (one star).
2,Not a Training Potty !!!,"I was disappointed after I bought this potty to see that my daughter was having a hard time staying on it. First, the product was not stable; it did not adhere correctly to the floor, and would move left or right every time she was trying to get on it. Secondly, I had to remove the lid, which kept on closing onto her back. Finally, Safety 1st should have installed a shaped ring that was more adapted to the baby's bottom, so she knows where to stay, and get used to the sitting. My daughter is now 2, and I am finding myself shopping for another potty! ..."
1,Very disappointing :o(,"We purchased this potty because it had all the bells and whistles others have noted. However, it is nearly useless for the main reason I got it; to use as a potty trainer. The seat whole is round and simply too small. We have to be very careful to position by daughter on the whole depending on what we are expecting her to do. If she is too far forward, urine spills over the seat and onto her clothes and the floor. It is very disappointing to a toddler to have made it to the potty and done everything right, but have to change into dry clothes anyway. My friend bought a Graco Soft Seat Potty and Step Stool, and it is so much better. This Safety 1st model is worthless."
2,Not the best on the market,"We purchased this potty as well as another model, using this one in the 1st floor powder room. I liked the idea of step stool plus potty, and now am sorry for the purchase.My daughter is tiny for her age [barely makes the 3% level for 3.5 year olds] so the size isn't a problem. The problems we have had is that the angle of the hole in the potty [or lack thereof] causes the stream to aim out of the bowl, down the front of the potty and all over her clothes and the floor! Not the best design! As for cleaning, yes the 'pot' does come out easily, but with a beginner-potty user, I find that it isn't a sealed pot, and leakage occurs into all sorts of crevices that probably weren't expected. This seems to be a case where design doesn't meet real-life use! We much prefer the other potty we bought."
2,poor quality,"At first I thought this was a great product. Until after a few months of opening and closing (to dump contents) one of the hinges broke. No big deal unless you are moving it, then you have to make sure it's closed all the way and is snapped in the front. But when the guard broke I was very upset. Having a son, this is a crucial part of the potty. I tried emailing Saftey 1st many times. They wanted product numbers, well with the box disgarded months ago and no numbers anywhere on the product I was lost. I would not recommend this product for little boys. After 2 weeks of messy potty breaks still waiting to get a replacement guard."
3,"Good Potty, but bad for little boys",Safety 1st made a great sturdy potty with one mistake. The splash guard that you use for little boys comes off way to easily. If you know anything about toddler you know that this it a little too tempting. My son took it off all the time and I was afraid it would get lost. I returned mine and bought the Royal Potty. We are much happier with that one.
2,Not too sturdy,"I took my daughter out shopping for potties and decided on this one because it looked like a toilet, had arm rests and seemed sturdy. When I brought it home I was not impressed. I could not get the top portion of the potty to sit correctly on the bottom without a lot of manipulation. Many times the potty simply collapsed to one side or another. My daughter tried to pick it up and the whole potty just came apart. I will be returning this potty for one with less functions and more stability. I think this potty sacrifices good potty functionality for the ability to be later used as a step stool."
2,Affordable....not practical,"Our two year old began showing the ""signs"" about a month ago. He seemed excited at first but when I sat him on it he was uncomfortable and the basin is just too small to cover the front and the back. He tried but has since lost interest. I can't say that this won't work for another parent but I wish that I would have thought of the time involved for the first several attemps and bought one with a padded seat and more room to go in. He is 32"" inches tall and 32 pounds. I don't know what they were thinking when they designed this but I wasn't thinking when I bought it either."
1,What a Pain!!!,"I bought this potty last night, all excited to have my 20 month old daughter begin using it. I ORIGINALLY liked the idea of having to lift the toilet seat lid to remove the ""cup"". I thought that would make it difficult for my daughter to empty it herself. Well, it take two hands to lift the seat because you have to hold the base still, the seat comes unhinged from the top, and the ""drawer"" that holds the ""cup"" does not slide well. I am just glad we have not begun using this because I am going to take it back and get a different potty seat."
2,Not for Boys,We have this potty for our 2 year old son. I have found that the guard is not tall enough to keep urine in its place. The potty has an open place under the seat where the urine collects and then is hard to clean.
1,Hole Too Small,"I bought this potty for my 2 year old son. When we used it for the first time, he looked at me and said, ""Mommy this seat is too little"". After trying to adjust him for a while, we both became frustrated. The hole was indeed too small and that deflector was too close, causing urine to splash up on his clothes."
2,Useless for a Boy,"This was the second potty chair I got for my son. And again, this one did not work. The cover for a boy does not stay at all. Almost by toutching, it will fall off.... I like the part you can use as a step tool, but not as a boy's potty chair!"
2,Not so special,"We have just potty trained our 22 month old daughter using this potty chair, and after reading many of the reviews I have to agree with the fact that this chair is somewhat messy. She seems to like to use it, but splashes out everytime she goes. It isn't really great for a girl either, but it does work. Maybe it has something to do with the comfort of the seat."
2,Don't waste your money,"I have a larger-than-average male toddler and the splash guard is useless. If he sits slightly forward it may actually catch the urine...that is if the guard is still in place. It's attachment is flimsy at best and rarely stays in place long enough to be worth the effort. The whole unit seems flimsy in construction. Maybe it's because my toddler is bigger than most but for boys, don't bother!"
2,Chair a pain for training boys & very cheaply built,"I'm not satisfied with the construction of this potty chair at all! The little shield that attaches so boys don't pee all over is a joke. It comes off way too easy and ends up landing in the bowl of your child's waste. My 2 yr old is always pulling the sheild off, and it isn't pleasant at all to have to fish it out of a bowl of poop. The chair also comes apart way too easy-making learning to use the potty undesirable. This potty chair has gone in the trash and I purchased the Royal Throne instead, which I would give 5 stars to. Since originally writing this, I have edited it, and I wouldn't give The Potty Step N Stool any stars!"
1,Tipsy potty,"To a potty training toddler there is probably nothing scarier then sitting on a potty and then having it tip and fall. This is exactly what happens to my son when he sits on this potty. I bought it largely due to the low price, however you get what you pay for because now I have to go and buy another one! This is not a good potty training chair at all. Did I mention that the seat lid does not stay up?"
1,Not a good potty,"I do not like this potty at all. I will be returning it soon. It falls apart too easily and each time my daughter tries to get on it, it slides or falls apart. The lid also constantly falls against her back which focuses her attention more on the lid than going potty. (If she's lucky enough to be able to get on it in the first place)"
1,not so good,"I don't think that this potty even deserves one star. It was the first of three pottys that I have bought. This does fall apart very easily - frusterating to a child who is trying to learn something new. The deflector shielf falls off if you look at it and the seat doesn't fit on the base very well. I tried to use it on the ""big"" potty but it seems to be made for toilets with a round hole, not oblong. It sat back so far that my son would climb up and put his feet on the regular seat to scoot himself back far enough. Duct tape or super glue might be the answer. I'm hoping to get a quarter for it at my next yardsale."
1,NOT FOR BOYS!!!!!,"I bought this thinking how ideal that it converts from a potty to step stool and you can even remove the top and put it on the big potty. My opinion now is that I would never buy or suggest it ever again! I have a little boy and EVERYTIME he sits down to go potty, he takes out the little piece that guards him from going potty on the ground (the piece between his legs). It ends up in the potty or the toilet, whichever he's on and poop gets on it and then he goes potty on the floor because there's nothing to keep him pointing in the potty. I have to invest in another potty now and I really think I'm just going to toss this one. I wouldn't even give it to another person!!!"
1,"Save your money, you can have ours!","This has to be the MOST frustrating potty ever!! Seems to be a common thought with us moms of boys! Not only does the lid fall on him and the whole thing shifts unsteadily, but the deflector pops right off and, like the other reviewers said, ends up in the potty or on your floor, in the tub, etc. Potty training is difficult enough without having to deal with a frustrating potty! If you REALLY want this potty, feel free to come and get ours!!"
2,This potty is not for boys!,"I was very disappointed with this potty. The guard does not stay on the potty and after a few days of pulling it on and off, my toddler actually broke it! The lid is useless when the guard is on, and it is very difficult to take apart to clean."
2,I'd pass on this,"Okay, my daughter loves this potty and is 99% potty-learned, but I can't wait to get rid of it. The inner compartment has several crevices that make it difficult to clean up spills (which occur every time she closes the lid to use it as a step-stool). I have to spend way too much time cleaning this. We have another one that I purchased at a discount store for less than half this price and it's a lot easier to clean, although my daughter does prefer using the safety first potty because it looks more like a real potty."
2,Not impressed,"Connection between seat and base is an issue. It doesn't always join evenly (unless you play with it) and has scratched my son's thighs when not perfectly closed. Before this incident I noted that the guard is easily removed (a toddler past time), tips into the toilet, and too high to leave connected between trips if you want to encourage independence. The inner pot is easily removed by a toddler. The design does prevent floor spills but can result in collection of urin within the unit. It does seem to work okay as a step stool its only current function."
2,Not the best,"Our boy complains about comfort. Also, the removable urine shield fell off constantly, usually into the potty. That is until my son accidently flushed it. He really dislikes even sitting on it but does fine with a different model our sitter has. We'll be trying another model soon. Update: I bought a Baby Bjorn seat and by day two he was completely potty-trained!!! He has not had an accident since. I attribute this DIRECTLY to the seat. He liked the new one and found it much more comfortable(he didn't complain.) Hope this helps."
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased this potty for my son because I liked it's multiple uses. I regret the purchase. The hole is way too small for him. It leaves a ring on his tush if he is on it for more than 30 seconds. The removable boy guard is designed to flip down into the bowl so you can close the lid. This has made all kinds of problems for my son when he tries to sit down. Usually the guard either falls down into the bowl, or it comes off between his legs.In order to empty the bowl, you have to flip up the entire, top heavy potty, not just the little lid. The ""hinge"" that holds the potty together is just two pieces of ribbed plastic that slide into slots in the back of the potty.I am very disappointed and I wish I could return it. Now, I am reading the reviews on Amazon for another potty. I thought I would try and save some of you a waste of money."
3,Take the splash guard out for your little boy,"This is a great potty, and we did use it for a bit, then bought another one (Grace soft seated potty) and gave this one to grandma. The one major problem with this potty is the splash guard. It is hard plastic and therefore if you can get your little boy to sit on the potty without straping himself, then he can't get up with it in. I gave up on the splash guard the first time, it was a waste of time."
3,Could be better,I bought this product for my 22 month old son named Jake. I liked the way it looked and I thought that it would hold up well but that was not the case. When I started training him I had him sit down to pee. He had no problem with that! But when he would sit down to poop he would complain that the hole was to small for his bottom(he is normal sized)so much so that when the poop would come out it would hurt and go all over the back of the chair. I was not to happy about this!
1,maybe the production is inconsistent?,"I read the mixed reviews, and still was excited about a single product that could go from floor potty to a step stool and seat on the big potty. The truth is, ours is just a piece of [cruddy] plastic. The top portion does not fit well on the bottom, they dont even match up well, so they're constantly coming apart. Others seem to not always have this problem. I can sort of wedge them together but my son likes to carry around the potty by the handles and it all comes apart. The two hinges in back definitely do not hold it all together. The splash guard, like others said, pops right off and my sons tends to want to remove it (who wrote that they just said ""no"" once to their son? if that solved your problem you do not have a normal two-year old!!). He likes that the lid goes up and down but it falls on him while he is seated. I haven't tried it as a step stool, it just went into our attic."
1,Poorly Made. Get something else!,"I bought it and attempted to assemble this potty. The four grips that supposedly anchors the seat cover did not fit the potty and the fit and finish were dismal. So, I returned it. This potty looked great from the picture but is poorly made and the parts did not fit at all. You are better off with another potty."
2,Bad Splash Guard Design,"This is the second potty I have bought for my son. I have boy girl twins. Our first potty, a shower gift, was the Fisher Price Royal Potty and although we loved it, it was too small for my 21 month old boy who is a little stocky. His legs are thicker and he good size. So we kept it for my girl. Then we bought this potty just for him because it is bigger. It does have ample room for stockier kids. But the spash guard design is awful. All he as to do is brush against it when he sits down and it falls off. If you have a girl this would be a great potty with the handles and fold down lid. But if you have a boy...go another route. We are still looking!"
1,big mistake!!,"We bought this potty as our 1st try. First of all it is extremely difficult to empty, you have to completely take it apart to empty the pot. Not to mention pee gets into every nook and cranny.....the whole inside is hollow and full of these squares that you can't possibly clean in less you soak it in hot soapy water. Just a pain!! The opening is smaller than most and completly flat. Very difficult to use. We bought the graco soft seat potty. What a HUGE difference!!!!"
1,Not for bigger potty trainers,"I bought this and immediately returned it. The hole in the ""seat"" is way too small for any sort of potty to go through, especially for larger toddlers. My 21 month old daughter is big for her age at 36 pounds, 35 inches tall, so this potty chair did not look comfortable for her and actually tipped forward when she sat on it. Also it seemed odd to just have a tiny hole in the flat seat top without the traditional rounded or padded seat that toilets have.I bought the Graco Rewards instead and it seems to be the right size with no problems so far."
2,Multiple Issues,The hole on this potty chair is ridiculously small. There's no way that my son can poop and pee in the same seated position. He has to move a bit back to pee in the potty then forward to get the poop in it. What a hassle while he's learning potty skills!And the pee guard is worthless. It falls off ALL the time with just barely a tap but it is SO tall that it gets in his way when he's trying to sit down so gluing the darn thing into place isn't an option either. This chair was a serious disappointment.
2,Nightmare to Clean,"My daughter likes this potty and it has worked fine for us, except for the fact that it is a nightmare to clean. There are a bunch of nooks and crannies inside the potty and when something gets in there it is almost impossible to clean."
1,Good if you have a very small child,"We purchased this because it looked sturdy and had a lid so it would be good for travel.It is only good if you have a small toddler or are training at a very young age, The hole is really small so if you only want to train them to pee in the thing then you are ok otherwise you will have a mess to clean!We returned it the same day we bought it!"
2,Poor design makes this a frustrating chair,"This chair is poorly designed, and I don't recommend it.The top and bottom do not fit securely, which means the slightest wiggle from my child means the top half will go askew. The lid doesn't lean back far enough, so again, the slightest wiggle from my child means the lid falls forward, hitting her in the back (which distracts her and makes her wiggle more to turn around and see what just hit her). Pull out the ""drawer"" in the base to remove the potty bowl, and the whole potty chair separates into its various components. The chair is hard to clean (full of nooks and crannies--how sanitary could that ever be?) and the whole thing needs to be disassembled to empty the bowl. I ended up buying a Baby Bjorn (two pieces, easy clean, and never falls apart! aaaaaaah) for regular potty sessions to save my sanity, and now use the top half of the Potty-n-Step stool on the adult toilet (the Baby Bjorn potty can't be used on the adult toilet due to its sleek design)."
1,Not a great choice,"This potty seat is designed to meet several needs, which sounds great. But it doesn't do any of them very well. As a stand-alone potty seat the hinges are not at all stable. We barely used ours and it was falling apart. The step stool can only be used when you're done with the potty and it's so short so it doesn't do much, plus it slides around on our tile floor. The seat didn't fit all that well on our toilet, so my daughter feels unsteady. Three strikes! This one sounds good on paper but I ended up tossing it and buying all three items separately."
2,Not the best for a Boy,I bought this for my almost 3 year old son and it just didn't work. I took it back to Walmart for a refund. The pot and hole is too small for a big boy and the deflector shield didn't want to stay on very well. NOT GOOD!! Could have been a disaster but I always caught it before it was. It IS a sturdy seat and doesn't move around.
1,not as sturdy as it looks,"I bought this potty thinking that it was durable and the fact that it came apart to be a step stool and fit on the toilet made it even better. Boy was I wrong!! The clasp on the back of the seat that hook it to the base are cheap. They rarely hook right and when on top of the toilet it is very insecure. I did give it one star because the step stool is great, but I could have bought one of them for half the price."
4,Has been great for two kids-and on a boat!,"This potty is great-first little toddlers can learn to sit and go on the potty on the floor then the seat can be removed and snapped onto the toilet seat and the base flipped over and opened as a step to get up to the potty! And with built-in handles, little people can hang on! There is a removeable cup inside the potty that has to be emptied/rinsed/cleaned after every use but that has never been a drawback for me. It is much easier to clean a removeable cup than a whole toddler potty! We have even taken this potty out on our boat with us. Toddlers will not use public park facilities but ours were happy to use their own familiar potty! I would buy this potty again."
2,Don't buy this one for a boy,"The splash guard falls off at the slightest movement. And if your son has chubby legs like mine, it pinches his legs when it is on. The hole is much smaller that most potties. The top does snap securely onto the family toilet, however it's no fun retrieving the splash guard from the toilet water."
1,Worthless!,"I bought two of these (one upstairs and one downstairs) only to have to give them away because they fell apart every time my child sat on it. The design, while in theory is a great idea, is very poor. Also, the guard to keep little boys from urinating on the floor is quite sharp on the edges and my son became afraid of it quickly. We have the Bjorn and the Once Upon a Potty potty now and he much prefers those."
1,Don't buy this!!,"Nanna purchased this for my daughter. She can remove the top from the base and carries it around. I am in the process of looking for a ""solid"" potty."
2,I would highly recommend the Pottypal instead!,"I purchased this item last year and was less than impressed with its quality and functionality. It was too small for my elongated toilet and not quite large enough for my round toilet either. Further, it is less than sanitary since it is partially sumberged in the bowl and thus sprayed with emissions. The stool is too bulky to be used reasonably and scratched my walls. In sum, it is of poor quality.I just purchased and highly recommend the Pottypal which can be used to the age of seven to lessen the size if the bowl and eliminate the fear of fallin in. I fould mine for $18.95 on ebay! You can see it's usefulness on pottypal.com"
2,caused a rash,"I had no complaints about how sturdy the potty was, or how well it worked. My complaint is that about a week after she started using it, my daughter got a rash in a circular ring on her bottom that matched the potty. We stopped using it and the rash cleared up. We tried it again and she immediately got the rash back.In the end my daughter was potty trained without a potty seat on an adult toliet (it can be done) and we only used the step stool part of the potty."
1,Good potty/Bad step stool,"I bought this potty when my son was 14mts and he loved it and was potty trained by 18mts with the occassional accidents, and night time diaper use. When he was about 2- 2 1/2 I used it as a step stool, and he fell, the step stool slipped and kind of collapsed under his weight. (he was of average weight.) He did not get hurt because I was standing behind him and I caught him. But he was so tramatized that he didn't use the big potty until he was maybe 3- 3 1/2 yrs. I took off the lid because it was just a nusiance.BEWARE this is dangerous as a step stool.My son is now almost 8 yrs old and I am suprised this potty is still on the market."
2,Hard to clean,"I bought this chair as a second potty to keep in the car. What made me buy it was the fact it turns into a step stool and then a toilet insert as well. What I didn't know is it is a pain to clean. I have another potty which a much simpler design and I love it. You can clean it in 2 seconds flat. When I first brought this potty home, I was going to see which one my twins daughters wanted to use in the house (the other would go in the car), but after 1 use this potty is for sure the one going in the car. I would not buy this potty again."
1,"So many flaws. Not a practical potty, especially for BOYS!","This potty has so many flaws.For one, the opening is just tiny. My son ended up pooping all over the seat because of that.For boys the splash guard is a real problem. If you don't have the splash guard on, of course he pees all out the front, but it flipped right down as my son sat down, so not only did he pee all out the front and on to the floor, he also peed on to the splash guard.It comes apart so easily, and it doesn't go back together all that well.And YIKES! All the places the germs can collect! There are so many little places for bacteria, both on the inside and outside of this potty.We gave ours away and got the Baby Bjorn potty instead, which is awesome!"
3,"She thought it was her ""special seat""","My daughter loved having her own potty and the chair-like qualities made this appealing. She also liked using it as a step stool prior to potty training. However, it was not easy to clean or even rinse - sides too wide to fit under the faucet of most sinks. Also, because it was so appealing as a chair, if I didn't get to it fast enough, my daughter would drag it along to ""help"" or to use as a TV chair - and our carpeting got christened more than once!"
1,Terrible potty,"I've had this potty for awhile now and today our new one came and I could finally throw this one in the bin where it belongs.The biggest problem I had was that the wee seemed to leak from the pot into the outta casing, meaning that it had to be dismantled and hosed off after EVERY use. If you didn't realise this had happened you would on your next trip to the bathroom as the whole room stank of urine....took me awhile the first time to realise where it was comming from!I have now got the small baby born potty and it's wonderful...simple design and so easy to clean."
1,notahappymommy,"I bought this from the store near us, thinking that it was simple, but had all the basics and my daugher seemed to like it as well. We got it home and in less than a week the hinges broke. The bottom has no resistance to slip and when she tries to sit down it just slides out from under her. And there is no good mechanism to keep the front closed. I usually like safety first products, but this one has a lot of faulty features."
1,absolutely not for boys,"I wish I had read the reviews before buying this potty. There wasn't a great selection at the store, so I chose this potty because I noticed that a friend had this one. As soon as I took the potty out of the box, I was very disappointed. The splash guard does NOT click into place. The seat does NOT lock into place and that spells disaster for a curious toddler. The hole is too small in my humble opinion. The only thing I like about this potty is that it has a lid like a real toilet. Don't buy it!"
1,HORRIBLE FOR BOYS!!,"My son was ready for potty traing & very excited about using the potty chair. The splash guard is a nuisance. It was almost impossible for him to sit down with it on and it always fell on his penis when he was sitting down. After several attempts to get it to stay up it became a frustration for both of us. Needless to say, my son lost his enthusiasm for the potty. I quit using it after 3 days. I should've stopped using it on the first day!I ended up buying a Royal Potty, which is excellent for boys, but my son now has an aversion to sitting on the potty and tries to sit himself as far back as he can away from the splash guard whether it is there or not. I'm sorry I ever bought this. It's set me back in the training process more than I'd like. I wish I had read the reviews before buying it. If you have a boy please DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
2,Not a good choice for boys,"I wish I would have read these reviews prior to purchasing this chair. The ""deflector"" shield to keep boys from splattering all over continues to fall down, fall off, and land in the bowl with the waste. My son has had a couple of accidents because of me trying to attach the deflector. This potty chair frustrates both of us!"
1,"""Hurt the boys first "" potty-simply DANGEROUS","I got this potty for my son and as a first-time mom could not even forsee the bad sides of this potty- first, the hole is so small, that at no time could my son fit both his back and front in it- something was left out. And I tried it since he was 3 months old!!!!Then, it should be truly called ""Hurt the boys first"" potty- I do not know which smart head came up with the deflector design, but it has SHARP edges and is THIN and it just sticks into the flesh like a razor.Then, as if it is not enough- the deflector does not stay in place, keeps falling down, and I tried sticking it with tape first and threw afterwards, tired of diving after it into the toilet bowl.I do not really know how small the child should be to use this potty- probably still in the womb, so I do not know what use to make of it- totally a piece of dangerous trash."
1,Disgusting!,"Due to the smallness of the hole, the urine seems to go all over. This is especially disgusting, since it goes inside the ""upsidedown stepstool"" that has too many deep nooks and crannies. I have to take it outside to hose it down!! Pee pee shouldn't be so difficult. Also the lid falls down when my daughter sits on it, so I had to remove it. I am getting a new one today!!!!!!!!!"
3,It worked well,"I don't actually dislike the product, my son likes it too. But the manufacturer could have done a better job. I also took off the deflector but my son actually likes it."
1,Don't buy,"This potty chair is horrible. The lid is hard to keep open. The chair part continually slides off the base. It has latches in the back to secure the base, but they easily come out. My grand daughter is afraid to use it since is it so unstable."
2,was this ever tested?,"This was the first potty I purchased and I thought I would like it because later you could use it as a stool. It is poorly designed and made. The guard comes off very easily and my child could take it off himself. If you have a boy, the guard is essential. The whole seat comes apart very easily also. If you have an active and curious child, this is not the potty for you. I decided to purchase the baby bjorn potty instead and I love it."
1,Not as sturdy as advertised!!!,"My son, attempting to use the potty by himself, broke two pieces off the unit. Both pieces broke when my son sat down too hard. One of the pieces was necessary for potty-training a boy. The other was a hinge that allows you to ""lift the seat"" and remove the bowl. I would only recommend this potty to the parents of a small girl because it's not made for larger(rougher) little boys!"
3,Not so easy to clean,My niece used this potty as at grandma's house when she visited. It isn't as easy to clean as noted. The potty part slides out but the top part often needed to be cleaned as well and it was time consuming to take apart.
2,Looks nice but...,"My kids love to use this potty because it has a lid like the big potty, and the handles are nifty. If only the bowl wasn't such an odd shape making it virtually impossible to rinse out in the sink (after dumping the contents in the toilet of course!)."
2,Not for little boys!! Too small..read on,"I cannot begin to express my dissapointment over this potty seat. Being a mom of 3 boys, two of which have long since been potty trained...I have seen many potty chairs and this one is the worst yet. I purchased this one for my son who is now 22 months, and he cannot even fit properly on this chair. Being a boy who needs to use the deflector shield, there is absolutely NO ROOM for him to sit comfortably and keep his parts behind this shield. He is an average size baby and we utterly had to put our training on hold because of this problem. Not to mention the deflector shield falls off again and again...probably because there is insufficient room to sit comfortably on this chair. For girls on the other hand it might be ok. The chair is sturdy and nicely made..but other than that worthless. Thanks for listening..hope it helps!!"
1,terrible!!,"I have 2 sons, this seat is not good for exploring boys! My 15 month old can take it apart in 3 seconds! not to mention the pea guard for boys does not attach easily! When you manage to get it on, it tilts in ward touching our sons body, which makes him scream. It also falls into the potty which makes me scream! Withought the guard the pea is EVERYWHERE! My son is trying, this potty isn't helping! Also the sliding draw with the bowl has sections, if the bowl is not fitted 100% correcty, the pea leaks into the bowl and into all the sections of the draw making cleaning rather difficult. And if all that isnt enough, the hinges of the seat don't stay in and tend to pinch your childs rear end, all leading to a very upset 21/2 year old boy! (the detachable toilet insert, does not easily fit on the standard toilet seat.) I would not reccomend this seat at all!"
1,Save your money and buy something else,"I bought this product for my 16 month old son just to begin acquainting him with the concept of using a potty. He loved it. Within five seconds he achieved a grand sense of accomplishment having dismantled it from top to bottom and distributed the pieces across three rooms. On top of it everytime he tried to sit on it, it made a popping noise from the seat not fitting securely on the base. Then when he tried to lift the lid it kept falling back down, sometimes it fell on his back when he would sit down. No matter what, he always would jump up from it immediately giving me a look of displeasure and mistrust in this product. It has nice handles for the kids to hold on to, but my son NEVER felt comfortable on it long enough to exercise that feature.Take it from me, this seat is a waste of your time and money. You'll only find yourself back in the store looking for a simpler model."
1,Hunk of junk!,"This potty chair is just awful! The hinges on the back of the seat are a joke and do not keep the seat in place at all -- the whole top continually falls off -- especially with toddlers who can easily dismantle the thing. The seat cover is not removable, as it should be, and continually falls down over the seat. Don't waste your time or money on this one...potty training is hard enough without this chair making it harder!"
2,Not Too Well Designed,I bought this potty chair for my little girl and am not too crazy about it. She wasn't interested in using it at first but did enjoy removing the entire top section to see what was below. Unfortunaly due to the fact that there are very flimsy plastic straps holding the rear of the seat to the base this caused a problem. After less than a week of using this toilet I now have to check very carefully to be sure the top is on properly (a huge pain when she is in a hurry to go to the bathroom) or we risk having her end up on the floor. The straps no longer hold the top in place properly and every time my daughter sits down the whole front of the toilet slides forward. This usually worries her and does not add to her enthusiasm about sitting on the potty! I wouldn't have bought this potty if I had known what I know now!
1,Comes apart too easily,"My son loves this potty, as a toy to take apart and drag all over the house. The entire top (seat and all) comes apart too easily. He grabs one of the handy handles and the entire top comes off, making it difficult to be used as it should be.Also, we had some problems with the lid falling down when he tried to sit on the seat as he should.We're looking for a different potty."
2,Save your money,I don't like this seat at all. It isn't very sturdy and kind of hard to empty. The seat comes detached from the base when she sits on it and scares her. The other problem we have had is the lid doesn't stay open very well. It does fit on the regular toilet but again the lid always falls on her. As a stool it is not very sturdy either. I wish I wouldn't have bought it!
4,Full of details about ancient societies and the sky,"I was expecting more of a philosophical and historical treatise, building on the idea that shamans (priests, etc. . .) used the sky to enhance their influence on ordinary people. While that idea is stated, it is not really proven. It is, however, supported by amazing anecdotal descriptions of ancient societies and their relationship to the sky.There is no great reasoning or logic here, but there is a great collection of related observations."
4,excellent music that can't be easily classified,"That's what I like most about this band. They cover a lot of musical ground without trying to be one certain thing. This cd sounds like a live studio performance, which I wouldn't doubt since I've seen them live and they do indeed deliver the goods. Anyway, I can't add much that the person below didn't already say. I definitely recommend this one, especially if you've never heard Neurosis before."
5,"""Copland-Again Pleasing to the Ear""","This work of Copland created in me the what I believe to be the goal of good art: interest in the artist. I am now an Aaron Copland fan solely due to this CD and I now am searching music stores who might carry his work. Majestically melodious as well as quietly grand, Copland's particular style of composing American music is a joy to listen to. I enjoy listening to Copland's music because his music makes me want to listen to his music all the more. Highly recommended for those in love with the composition of music as well as listening to music."
4,Copeland vs. Bernstein versions,"I have both this CD and Leonard Bernstein's Copeland CD, and much prefer this one. With Copeland conducting, the tempos are more fluid and the orchestration cleanly delineated."
5,This is a great CD.,"I really liked this. It has a variety of well known and not-so-well-known music. It has some funny music as well as serious pieces. If you like Aaron Copland music, this is for you!"
4,Nail Biter!,"Stephanie Kane is a master, especially for a first book! She held my interest completely through the entire book. Having lived in Denver, it was great being able to actually identify authentic landmarks and street names. It made me keep reminding myself this was ficton! I couldn't figure out who the murderer was until Stephanie told us at the very end. She kept pointing to so many different possibilities that it was a challenge to try figure it out before the end of the book.I'm now involved in Quiet Time and am looking forward to her next installment.Bravo, Stephanie!"
3,Get the original releases instead,"Yeah, sure these tracks are great, but then again, the producers of this compilation could have picked ANY 12 tracks from the Gramavision years and the results would have been superior. Don't waste your entertainment dollar--start by picking up the Gramavision releases Still Warm, Blue Matter, and Loud Jazz and prepared to be blown away. The other Gramavision releases, Electric Outlet and Flat Out, are not essential, but still good. Fans of Scofield's fusion years should also pick up I Can See Your House From Here, Scofield's dueling guitars date with Pat Metheny. If you would like to read more reviews like this, check out JazzboNotes.com."
4,Outside Jazz comes in,"Myra Melford's achievement is considerable. She comes from the leading (if not bleeding) edge of jazz with melodic, lyrical and harmonically very inviting music. Not that she panders in the least, but she seems to have a natural knack for extroverted playing and composing, not unlike her mentor Henry Threadgill. She's also a terrific pianist who might remind you a bit of a more fluid and concise Cecil Taylor or harmonically wilder Don Pullen, but I wouldn't call her an imitator of anyone.On this recording she's joined by some very fine horn players (Dave Douglas, Chris Speed), and she lets them play. Her own playing is at once virtuosic and effective. There is a free, improvisational feel to this music, but it always holds together with just enough structure.Good stuff - we need more musicians like Myra Melford."
5,Coleman Hawkins in person,"In the early 1960's I had the pleasure of seeing Coleman Hawkins do a two hour Friday matinee at the Showboat in Philadelphia (near the famous South Street of Orlons fame). He was magnificent, elegant and in a weekly series of matinees that included Charles Lloyd, John Coltrane, Wes Montgomery, Roland Kirk, Mongo Santamaria, Horace Silver and the great stars of the blossoming of acoustic jazz in the early sixties, the man who invented the jazz tenor sax as a solo instrument held his own playing to a very demanding audience in this small club around the corner from Pep's who had matinees on Mondays. It was a buffet of magic music in those days and the only place in Philadelphia to dine on such delights."
3,Too many filler pages.,There are a lot of filler pages & not enough subject matter. I was expecting more detail on cases of a medical examiner/pathologist. The book seems to just skim over them & spends more time on home life & assistants.
2,Disappointing,"I came here to write a review, only to find that R. Shultz of Chicago had already written it! I agree completely, and I don't think I can say it any better than Mr/Ms Shultz did. I wanted to like this book, but I could just not get through the extraneous drivel, repetition of cliches, poor organization of the chapters, inane jokes, and the author's pompous apologies for the inane jokes. I ended up doing a lot of skimming because I just didn't care what music accompanied each autopsy. The book should have been interesting, but it was boring. It would have greatly benefited from a good editor."
3,Slightly disappointed,I was disappointed only because I thought I was ordering the horse itself. The video is a little in depth for the age child I was purchasing for
3,somewhat disappointing,"This is not a bad book, by any means, but I had had higher hopes for it.I *loved* the Eyes of God, and couldn't wait for this one to come out in paperback so that I could find out what happened next. I'm still waiting. Eyes came to a definite conclusion; this one is obviously the second in a triology, and leaves half the characters hanging.Also - it's a minor quibble - but as expensive as books are these days, I expect the editor and proofreader to do their jobs. A minor misspelling, grammatical error or typo once in a while is one thing, but when major errors seem to crop up on every other page, I find it extremely off-putting.I hope the next in the series is better."
5,"John Marco, Master Storyteller",My favorite thing about John Marco's writing is that you just can't predict what is about to happen. There are no sacred characters. You never know who is about to be killed off. Every character is fair game. You will love this book. A well written book is always a pleasure!
3,"Good book, longgg read","This is a veryyyy long trilogy, but a rather good read. It follows a lot of characters over a long epic story. Well written and a fun read just could have done with a little short really wasn't any need for it to be this long."
4,Speedball,"For Johnny's fans, you have found IT, nirvana, paradise.....Herein we find a swell DVD where Johnny acts and drinks milk and buys rolling papers in a very amusing way. And we also buy a book that comes close to capturing his soul. Miss Antonia had enough time around Johnny to not just write him off as a manipulator--she checked her pockets and, with the love deserved, wrote the best biography we'll ever know of rock and roll's greatest expositor. May he rest in peace--and may you buy this."
2,disapointed,"product was as discribed, except for the soiled spot. Im glad I was able to get it out. When I purchase clothing over the internet I dont expect them to arrive needing to be laundered."
2,pants too large,"Sam, you made the pants too long! Too big & baggy, no way a true fit. However, microfiber material was nice. Had to return."
4,accessible,"This book delves into a scholarly look at the book of Psalms without overwhelming the lay reader. It clearly identifies the main discussions among scholars taking place today and historically both theologically and in the study of its structure. The chapters are brief, and the writing style informative and friendly. The text is full of examples. I would heartily recommend this book to someone who is curious to begin studying Psalms in a more technical manner while seeking healthy interpretation of the text spiritually. It could also help the reader start to build a context and framework within which to put information gained in future and perhaps more heady studies of the book."
2,Not for my needs,"If you want your engine to be louder, then this is for you. Dyna testing shows no increase of horse power and a honda tech told me this would be cheaper to manufacture than the stock air intake they make for your engine. I spent alot of time and money on my stereo, so im not interested in hearing my engine. If sound is what your after then get this."
4,Soft and light,these earplugs are soft and light - but you got to push them hard into your ears to screen out most of noise around.
5,NJ Mom says: practical plus inspiring equals a winner,"There isn't anything else on the market like this book. This is the book Naomi Drew was born to write, and she pours her whole life experience into it as a mother, a teacher, and an expert on conflict resolution. What Naomi has done is written a book that tells parents how to keep peace at home, step by easy step, while also raising compassionate kids to help make peace possible in the world at large. That's an amazing combination, and Naomi pulls it off. Readers will learn exercises to calm sibling battles, as well as how to teach kids to become peacemakers at school and work through organizations to foster global peace."
3,Time catches up with everyone,"Set in the late 24th century, where space station Q4 is under attack from a group of beings called the Time Soldiers. But behind them is another foe, someone who should not exist...The second of the Alternate Universe arc (the others being 'Blood Heat', 'The Left-Handed Hummingbird', 'Conundrum' and 'No Future'), this story follows on from the quite dark and bleak ending of 'Blood Heat' and, if anything, things get even bleaker!The story is split into different parts, and the three members of the TARDIS crew all have their own story strands to pursue until they slowly draw together towards the end.But for the very depressing atmosphere which pervades the novel, it might have been a good read! Not for those looking for a pleasant read."
2,WAR,"BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU ORDER THIS. I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS COMING FROM AUSTRALIA AND I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT A PAL REGION CODE O. THIS DVD WILL NOT PLAY HERE IN THE STATES AND I FELT THE SELLER SHOULD HAVE CONTACTED ME BEFORE TAKING MY MONEY FOR A DVD THAT THEY ARE AWARE, WILL NOT PLAY ON ANY OF OUR DVD PLAYER. I HAVE 3 AND IT WON'T PLAY ON ANY OF THEM. IT COST TOO MUCH MONEY TO SEND BACK, SO I AM STUCK WITH IT. I CONTACTED THE SELLER BUT I HAVE HEARD NOTHING BACK FROM THEM."
1,Lids do not fit.,"I bought a 12 cup, two 8 cup, and 4 two cup Anchor Hocking glass storage containers. They would be terrific if the lids/containers were level. Instead, the lids teeter-totter on top of the containers, on some as much as 1/4"". Some are better than others, but none of them fit right.I will not purchase another Anchor Hocking product without being able to examine them in person first."
4,"Nice, heavy duty storage","We replaced the majority of our tupperware fridge containers with these. They look better, don't warp in the microwave and don't keep us up at night wondering about the possibility of petrochemicals leaching into our food. While great for home storage, these don't travel (the lids don't form a strong seal to the containers)."
1,Exploded in microwave,"ThisAnchor Hocking Glass Refrigerator Storage Container 2 Cup Sizeliterally exploded in the microwave after approximately one minute, reheating rice.Thank the gods my microwave was not damaged in the explosion.*Caveat emptor*"
3,"A good book, but, not what you would expect","Although a very good and enlightening book, potential readers should be advised that the book is not what they would expect. The book flares off quite often to speak of other tribes, peoples, or nations, rather than discussing strickly of the Apache Medicine-men. If your intention is to study only the Apache Medicine-men, this book may seem to drag. However, if you do not mind learning of many cultures and customs, you will assuridly enjoy this publication."
3,Amsteel Blue Winch Rope,"Got item in timely manner, haven't actually used it yet, so can't rate it as to product satisfaction."
5,DRUMMING DOGMA,"This material is absolutely essential to the serious drummer. I studied with Alan for several years at his basement studio at his home in Lexington. Also there in attendance were the likes of people such as Steve Smith and a very young Terri Lynn Carrington. The list of famous students would be far too long to mention. This was the method he used back then and the information is priceless. Alan was a stern taskmaster and would not allow a student to proceed to the next lesson before he became proficient with the current one. Study this material religiously and attain complete four way coordination,speed,massive chops a musical approach to solo work and all around confidence with the drum set. I owe Alan a debt of gratitude for all he imparted.The kind of dicipline required will also transfer positively to other personal goals and endeavors one may undertake in life. GET THIS BOOK!!! The Drummer's Complete Vocabulary as Taught by Alan Dawson."
4,"The Holy Grail, Documented!","I studied with two drummers who studied with Alan Dawson (who taught, among other giants, Tony Williams). Not surprisingly, they taught me what Alan taught them. But not until now (as far as I'm aware) has any of Alan's students documented and published his methods. Now it is here, under a single cover.Between the covers of this book is a huge amount of challenging exercises that will broaden your musical vocabulary.It's not a long book. But the methods and exercises in it will keep you busy for months, and even years. It contains the very stuff (secrets?) that has made many good drummers great drummers. At the risk of sounding melodramatic, it is the holy grail of drumming.Be prepared to purchase two books to go with it, if you don't already own them: George Lawrence Stone's ""Stick Control"", and Ted Reed's ""Syncopation"". You will need these two books to complete most of the exercises in this book. (Maybe Amazon will bundle them one of these days.)"
5,"Barbara Clark, author A BREATH OF HEATHER","Fixation is a gripping story that held my attention from the first page. As Jessica and Grady's story unfolded, I found myself cheering for them even while I worried about the danger stalking them. The twists and surprises kept me on edge, and the final revelation of the villain's identity had me breathless. A wonderfully satifying book."
2,"Great music, bad orchestras","While this is some of Copland's best (and most under-recognized) work, the orchestras represented on the CD are, as a whole, awful. Even the London Symphony orchestra had an off day on ""Our Town,"" and the New Philharmonia Orchestra does a good job of butchering the rest of the CD, particularly ""Danzon Cubano."" The recording of ""Danzon"" is quite possibly the worst I've ever heard any symphony orchestra play. While it may be worth the money as a bargain CD, do NOT pay full price for this."
5,An audio lovers view,I am a Copeland lover since I was young and love his music so I would rate the music a 5+ but the recording is a dismal -3.I have a high end audio system and it brings out everything good and bad and this recording is one of the worst and will hit the waste can today.The sound has a complete lack of depth and sounds flat but yet the highs are hard even brittle and very fatiging! Sound seems to come from the extreme left and right with no center fill.I will look for a better recording!!
1,Do not buy this book!,"As a SAT and ACT tutor for several years, I was looking for a book to supplement some of the fine materials from Kaplan and Princeton Review. This book is not it! Rife with errors, it seems like the author has very little idea of what actual ACT and SAT questions are like. I'm astounded that parts of this book were ever read by an editor! Students who use this book blindly are likely to spend unnecessary time reading through grammatical rules that will never be seen on an actual test. It's unfortunate there are no supplemental books for the ACT's English section, other than this book, but that does not make this book worthwhile."
5,great gift,"This was meant to be a gift for someone, and it was everything I expected. Thanks to the previous reviews, I anticipated the ""free"" case to be inadequate; as a result I purchased a much nicer leather case with a magnetic flap from another store. I got the long blade engraved, and voila this was a perfect gift. It was shipped out on time. No complaints. Be aware though that like many other new pocket knives, a little bit of grease can be found at the base of the tools for smoother usage."
5,A must-have on my keychain,Tools are well built and easy to use. Tools are easy to pull out unless you have very short fingernails. For me the big knife and scissors are most useful. A must-have for me.
4,My son loves it!,"I bought this knife for my son who is in boyscouts. He loves the knife. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it's a little hard to pull some of the tools out. But over all this knife is great. I'm so glad I bought it."
4,Classic Swiss knife,"It was a present for my brother; I think he liked it a lot! It's nice that there is a little holder that can go on your belt. The knife is the classic one, so pretty good"
1,SHORT POUCH FLAP--It Doesn't Snap properly,"5***** Excellent Victorinox Swiss Army Huntsman Knife--I LOVE THE KNIFE--*****0* Free Pouch--Flap TOO SHORT--DOESN'T SNAP PROPERLY--CAN'T RETURN BECAUSEPackage was opened. Knife and Pouch in same bubble back--only way to put knife in pouch is to open it. I wanted a new pouch. Being packed together you should assume they will fit together. No way to just exchange the pouch--If a new pouch wouldn't fit properly, I would be happy to exchange it for the free flashlight that was also offered ad a package with the knife.BUYER BEWAREI was misled by the product guarantee, I found that if package opened, you're out of luck. There is no place to even exchange a defective part OR if you should send whole thing back."
1,will never buy from here.,"i ordered 2 of them for xmas gift, by 8th december and delivered by 16th dec BUT i got only one WITHOUT POUCH and was OPENED already. I let them know about this issue then have been told i will get my money back or items. but still waiting... maybe before next xmas who knows ?"
3,good knife but a wrong size pouch,"Victorinox Swiss Army Huntsman with Free PouchThe pouch is definitely too small for the knife it is sold with. I bought a few of them and none of the knives would fit into the pouch. I would not expect a thing like this from Victorinox. Knives, of course, are of highest quality; the pouches made in China."
4,nice deal,original multi-function swiss army knife which is always handy to have for people liking outdoor activities. It comes with a convenient pouch to protect it.
1,bad,It is expensive than other knife.you an close the bag when you put the knife inside!!!It really a bad product
3,Send a copy to Congress,The author did his homework as far as facts and validation. Could have made the format more reader friendly.
3,Stravinsky Conducts Stravinsky: Petrushka/Le Sacre du Printemps,I didn't want the Christmas music at the end -- just the Rite of Spring composition. So I'm disappointed. Sorry.
5,It's still a classic,"Whatever reservations one may have about the transparency of the recording, although it's pretty good, Stravinsky's own reading of Le Sacre has a level of savagery and almost daemonic power that has been imitated many times since but never quite duplicated. Petrushka is also played in a very bracing, invigorating manner. The Columbia Symphony Orchestra was a select group of top-drawer musicians, many of whom came from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, who were recruited expressly for the purpose of making recordings. These musicians are the same as those on Bruno Walter's legendary accounts of the Bruckner 9th and the Mahler 1st and 2nd. At medium price this should be an essential part of every collection. Strongly recommended."
4,A very intamate read,"While doing some research for a documentary on Pan Am era Clippers, I came upon this book and it became a true treasure. Sadly, the opportunites to interview poeple who once flew these great planes no longer exhist however the detials Dorothy Kaucher provides in her vivid recolections is certianly the next best thing."
5,new perspective for our pointless lives,"Even though I thought that the last two books were a let down I still give the story 5 stars. I just love the use of science fiction to make you think about your every day life and existance. I was laughing out loud. This is definately odd humor, not everyone is going to be amused but what about the answer to everything? and the new explanation on how life on earth began? Cows bred to want to be eaten, and with the ability to say so? You will find out that flying is possible, just don't think about it. I should read this again."
5,Perfect addition with your Share a story care bear,"Why I LOVE these books!!They are hardcover for one!!!A great size, not too big for the little ones BUT not too small either!!This story has a VERY cute Care bear twists!!the story is a nice length for kids, and great illustrations"
1,qlink emf protection pendent,i ordered the qlink after reading many favorable on line reviews. i have worn the pendant 24/7 for over five weeks now with no measurable improvement. i am going to keep the pendent even though is has a money back guarantee because i hope it will work some what with a prolonged usage.i would not recomend this to a friend
1,"C'mon, folks!!!","People, come ON!! This is totally bogus... the ""amazing"" thing is made of a zero ohm resistor/circuit, some wire and they are not even connected to each other!! There is no effect coming out of this thing, and for $90, you can buy some fine copper wire and a $0.005 zero ohm resistor and, presto! Wrap around your foolish head... You will get all of the (???) benefit, and have $89 left over to buy a nice towel to dry off your head after you soak it in the toilet to wake yourself up! Buy some cheap cayenne pepper capsules and take them regularly, they will actually provide an amazing benefit, and you will not be embarrassed and feel like a total imbecile after... unless you do not take them orally as recommended!"
3,I noticed nothing,"I purchased this item after wearing a friends for a couple days. After wearing hers I did feel a difference, I started to feel more energy. But, I argued that it might have been the placebo effect.When I received this one for myself - I felt nothing.I see other protection products that claim to genuinely work selling for 4-5k, I would be skeptical of those much less this less than $100 version.Just an honest review - take it or leave it."
1,Save your money,"Placebo effect. No difference whatsoever, and the manufacturer doesn't honor their 90-day return ""guarantee""; I actually tried reaching them.Now that I am stuck with this thing, I wear it every other day or so ""for fun"". For the past 6 months, never had I felt any difference.I agree with other reviewers that you are just getting a piece of copper wire in a plastic box with a shoelace.What's up with reviews telling us how this little plastic box fixes all their problems? What's up with overwhelming number of people marking them as ""helpful""? I guess I will just remove my review to let people waste their money in peace."
4,Qlink Does work!,"This is a precious gift that I made to myself. I wear it for less than a month but I started seeing results: I smoke & drink less, I have no problems keeping calm in most situations, my driving (on the golf course and at the wheel) is very stable. Last but not least; my ability to stay phocused has almost doubled.I am so happy with my Qlink pendant that I ""complimented"" it with an 18 carat gold chain."
3,How it works.,"In reference to the review prior, the qlink does not block but rather nuetralizesthe EMF. Find someone who can muscle test you wearing the qlink and with it off.If you are strengthened by it you know that it is working."
4,Review of,Wow this product seemed like it was brand new. But it wasn't I got it used but it came to me in mint condition. I'm satisfied by what I got at such a low price.
5,Perfect!,Amerock handles are sold in Home Depot for WAY more money. I strongly recommend buying here. This is a great deal!
2,terrrible,"pretty much every emcee on here is wack.. the track with elzhi an acception.. the beats are dope, but i knew better talent in detroit when i lived there."
3,To the point,"Well to start with review I must restate what is written in the albums notes. ""Originally I went into this project 2 produce a breakbeat LP."" OK, now that we got that out the way lets talk about this LP. I was (and still am) really diggin the Slum Village sophomore album Fantastic volume 2. This is not Slum Village. What we have here is a CD by Jay -Dee for the purist of the beat side of things. It's starts and finishes with tracks that he did the night before the album turn-in date giving it a gritty feel at times.Tracks like ""come get it"", ""shake it down"" and ""brazilian groove"" take you to that dark room at 2 in the morning drunk or high as hell type of zone. In this CD Jay Digga brings some of Detroit's unsung heroes in for the journey into neck breakin beats that he is known for. Elzhi does it up on ""Come get it"". Overall this has some things worth peepin but not a solid enough project for continued play in the deck."
4,This Album Is pretty tight Thelonius microphone!!!!,"YO this album is pretty tight!! Songs like Ya'll Aint Ready"" Give it Up"", ""Pause"", Shake it Down r my favorites. Jay dee also laid down some sweet instrumentals that is a banger. I am so glad there r producers out there who does not get all into the hype with that commercial [stuff]. You know what I am saying. He also gave info for beat heads to follow on how he did the beats giving u a treat. To me Jay dee is one of the illest underground producers out right now. A.K.A J88, Slum Village, J Dilla,I am out cop it if u can find it. If u cannot found it around your parks order it from amazon they came through for me. WORD"
5,Perfect length for AR15,"I was using a locking wrench on my free-spinning cleaning rod to twist the chamber brush. Bad idea. This is a solidly made, easy to hold tool. Well worth it"
5,London Symphony Orchestra is the best in the world!,"This CD done by the London Symphony Orchestra is the best available of the music from Giselle. It's superb. It's better than the music at any performance I have attended or watched on DVD, and it's better than the Giselle CD available by a Russian orchestra. The English always add that extra touch, the subtle nuisances that set this recording apart. It brings alive the enchantment of Giselle."
3,"BEAUTIFUL MUSIC, POOR RECORDING",The lovely music of the ballet Giselle is hard to relax and enjoy when the listener must hop up and down to regulate the volume. The volume is not at all universal for this CD.
4,Just One Voice to Listen To-Billy Gilman's!,"When I heard ""One Voice"" on the Country Music Channel, I was BLOWN AWAY! ""One Voice"" makes me cry when I hear it! He's a very good singer (and how old is he? 12?) I love his music!I'd also advise you to get Dare To Dream, because his songs will break your heart!"
5,a job well done,"hi billy ,my name is shawna ,I'am 22 .I think you are a wonderful singer for being so young.what made you get into singing?how do you keep-up doing both singing and school? or do you do home schooling?send me poster of yourself please.would you possibly comeing to saskatchewan anytime soon? I live in prince albert saskatchewan,my address is 1055 7th street east prince albert saskatchewan ,s6v-0t5.good luck in your career."
4,Billy Gilman-What a voice,Billy Gilman has one of the most amazing voices I've ever heard. The songs in this album are amazing and I enjoyed every one of them.
5,"Small Kid, HUGE Voice!","If you're like me, your first instinct is to mentally shove a ""child"" singer aside, having been so inundated with younger performers of late. After hearing his hit single, however, I bought his CD, and I've (pardon the pun) changed my tune.An unassuming lad, you wouldn't think he's anything special -- until he opens his mouth to sing... and WHAT a whollop he packs! His debut album proves that he's a force to be reckoned with.The thing about Billy Gilman that impresses me the most is that he puts his all into every song. He has a grand ol' time with the peppy and upbeat songs like The Snake Song and Wanna Get To Ya, and reaches deep down inside to give you that something more on the ballads. (Oklahoma nearly broke my heart.)I hope this kid'll be around for a LONG, LONG time.One Voice: And what a voice it is..."
5,voice of an angel,"This boy has the voice of an angel.His voice is pure and can move you to tears.In light of all the school violence these past few years, his title track,ONE VOICE,gives a message of hope to children and parents alike.We will be hearing more from this boy as he matures.I for one can't wait to see how his career progresses."
1,::::::can't handle this album anymore::::::::,"oh it's so bad! don't buy this! little screechy child, and to make it worse, it's country; like a ho-down on seasame street.Could it get any worse than one voice or i think she likes me? NOT POSSIBLE!"
2,"Hold me, I'm scared...",This creepy little queen gives me nightmares. Freddy Kreuger has nothing on Billy. I'll go to sleep tonight with the blanket pulled over my head as I try and elude his malignant presence.
1,Only one good song,"I bought this CD because I loved the One Voice song. Instead of One Voice, maybe the CD should be titled One Song. The rest of the songs seemed to be a quickly put together complitation of old songs that are inappropriate for the singer's age as well as his ability. My advice: Skip the album, buy the single."
2,One Voice Was Heard.......,"...unfortunately, it was Billy Gilman's. OK, he wants to be a singer. Great, more power to him! Sure, he sings on key, which is accomplishment enough for a child. But that doesn't necessarily make a true artist. I'm sure he'll sell plenty of albums due to the ""cute factor"". But a professional singer? No, not yet. Maybe years from now he'll be a star. Right now he just a novelty."
3,Billy G has a great voice for a kid,This is a good CD. The title song is a message that needs to be heard. Billy Gilman has a great voice for a young kid. Some of the songs may not be age appropriate. Generally the songs are good and Billy Gilman should have a promising career in music. I have a CD in which he sings a duet with Charlotte Church. The duet is beautiful. Both youngsters are teriffic singers.
4,One Voice,"Country music in particular needs an emotional ""hook"" along with artistic merit in order to be successful, and this single clearly makes the grade on both counts. Who knows what young Mr. Gilman's career will look like in a few years after the effects of vocal maturity and the music business take their inevitable toll. For now maybe it's enough to just enjoy a fresh clear voice while listening for the echoes of our own lost innocence.So it's Country. I liked it. This kid is good. Enjoy."
5,He's EXCELLENT!,"I am a 12 year old female. If you haven't heard this 12 year old sing, you are missin' somethin' GOOD! The first time my mom heard him, she liked him and told me. I was thinkin', ""If she likes him, I probably won't."" because my mom and I are so different, but I heard him in the car and fell in love with his voice. Then I got the cd and that's the only song I listen to now. You need this cd! And he is kinda cute too! Hehe!"
5,One Voice ... Billy's,"""One Voice Was Heard"". And no wonder. It was the unforgetable voice of Billy Gilman. When I listen to him sing and try to imagine that voice coming from a fairly typical looking 11-year-old boy, my mind balks. His voice is anything but typical! The power, beauty, tenderness and emotion of his singing is truly amazing. And wonderful. If Billy singing ""Oklahoma"" does not move you, better check yourself for a pulse.If I were stranded on a desert island with only one CD to listen to? This would be the one."
4,Billy Gilman worth a listen!,"Billy Gilman is quite the sensation at this time. He is best at delivering slow, ballad-type songs. I think for his age he should stay away from the faster ones. Overall his voice is beautiful and compliments the majority of the cuts on this album. I give it 4 stars"
5,What A Voice!,"I bought this CD for the ""One Voice"" single, but when I listened to it, I was in awe. Billy Gilman has an incredible voice and can sing as well as anyone out there. I simply couldn't believe that I was listening to a 12 year-old! I'm already awaiting a follow-up album!"
3,What a voice!,"I heard this voice and thought an angel had come to earth. For such a young man (12...does he count as a 'man'?), his voice is an incredible gift. Some songs are a little bubblegummish, but the overall content is enjoyable, and delightful.I recommend this CD highly."
1,Horrid! Skeet Shoot Material!,"This little whipper snapper's irritating caterwauling never fails to infuriate me to the highest level of -- oh wait, never mind, his 15 minutes of fame expired long ago."
4,santa shirt,looks really cute on my bear. easily washed and dried with the laundry. turns out really well.
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this text thinking it would give useful information on how to create an ""econest"" using timber frame and clay/straw techniques. I was disappointed that the book gave superficial information on the building techniques and seemed to be more of a promotional text for the writer's alternative home building system and business. If someone is interested in building a very upscale home using timber framing and clay/straw techniques and using the author's home building enterprise to do so, this is the book for them."
2,"Yes, Disappointing","I agree with S.L. Norton: the book is long on pretty pictures and short on details. It is mostly a paean to trendy alternative houses built by people with lots of money. It is also a promotional book for the author's building company. Aside from learning that ladder trusses are also called Larsen Trusses and that they are non-load bearing, I didn't get much out of the book. If you want to build a straw/clay house, find another source of information. Unless you like to look at pretty pictures that you can find in Natural Home."
1,I wish I had listened,One review describes this book as a coffee table book with nice photos but little practical assistance in learning about light clay straw construction. This is what the book is so if you want more practical help then what is already on the internet then this book isn't for you. If you want a coffee table book featuring great photographs of light clay straw homes then go right ahead. Moral of the story for me take better notice of reviews.
2,Very Poor Video quality,"The Alpha version of Postal Inspector is of very poor video quality. Otherwise, it may have been an interesting mishmash in what was Bela's last film under his original Universal contract. The stock footage of the flood is spectacular."
3,Given as a gift,I haven't watched this. It was given as a gift. Sorry. The actual transaction was fine. No problems.
4,Basin Street,The Canadian Brass recordings are my favorite. This cd was no exception. It was really a good listening and entertaining recording. I can't get enough of all the Canadian Brass cd's.
5,Basin Street with the Canadian Brass is First Class!!,If you enjoy the stylings of the Canadian Brass a la jazz then this is a C.D. I know you will enjoy in your collection.Basin Street Blues is a great tune in this set plus the stylings of Amazing Grace is also a first rate melody.George Segal adds a bit of his effort in this c.d however you can barely him at times due to the poor audio quality. Despite that flaw I am still giving this recording five stars!
1,Kansas State Liscence plate,It looks nothing like I thought it would. The product I received was a license plate that goes on the front of your car. Not the back. I would not rec-amend buying this product
5,This is the mecca of all SW guides,"This is THE guide to SW listening. Even if you aren't a listener yet, this book contains a SW radio buying guide. Got a radio? Wondering ""What station is that?"" look in the blue pages in the back. Wanna know ""what's on NOW""? It has listings of what's on organized by time.Excellant!"
1,Better Alternative,"The Passport is no longer being published. Last edition was 2009. But don't waste your time with old editions. Get yourself the latest edition of the WRTH otherwise known as the World Radio TV Handbook. It has all the information on radio and receivers that you could want. Magne's effort always was a hack publication by someone manufacturing a job for himself and it showed. Good for lining birdcages, nothing more."
3,Tickle My Funny Bone,This is not the best of autobiographies. But nevertheless it was a very funny book. The story about how his mother slept with Redd Foxx and Tito Jackson was a hoot. He's no Ernest Hemmingway but if want to read a very funny book buy it.
5,Finally: The Larry Sanders book we've been waiting for!,"Everything you expected and more from Larry Sanders, as he finally reveals not only which guests (female) he slept with, but the tortured and twisted childhood and early comedy years that made him into America's favorite talk show host. Larry takes the gloves off in this hilarious self portrait. No celebrity spared, including Larry. Brutal honesty and even more brutal laughs in Larry's personal saga, as told to to cowriters Garry Shandling and David Rensin. Also revealing looks at the Larry Sanders show staff, an interview with God, and the secret of how Larry Sanders saved Johnny Carson's life. Not just ""another book from another comedian"" but a subversion of all celeb bios. Funny. Inventive. Funny. Irreverent. Did I mention Funny? We can only hope for a second installment."
1,"Brilliant TV Show, Lousy Book",Thin in every sense of the word. Don't waste time or cash on this sad excuse for a book. The Larry Sanders Show was top quality - this is the exact opposite.
1,Cheap paste-up job,"A real disappointment. I enjoy Garry Shandling's comedy, but this looks like a quickie job to cash in on the end of his show. Short, disjointed chapters with only a laugh or two throughout; a photo section with even fewer laughs. A shame that Shandling didn't really seem to really ""work"" on this project."
1,"Deeply, deeply disappointing","'The Larry Sanders Show' was one of the best written and well made programs on TV. For year after year high quality television was produced by these guys, never once insulting the intelligence of their audience. When I saw there was a book I couldnt wait - I ordered it with great expectation and waited impatiently for it, but what a terrible surprise I got! To Shandling's great shame, this book is the exact opposite of his show - the jokes are obvious, lines are predictable, the whole thing is sophomoric and embarassing to read. Please, if you are a fan of one of the finest TV comedies ever made - do not fall for the temptation of buying, reading, or even glancing at this terrible book."
1,a sorry excuse for a book,"I've always liked Garry Shandling as a comedian. Perhaps that's why this book is so disappointing. Though you may laugh out loud once or twice, the impression is that he dashed this off in less than a week. Unlike his show, this book IS insulting to our intelligence. Read this book back to back with a brilliant master like Dave Barry and you will immediately see how not funny it is. The premise that he had sex with every beautiful hollywood star, as funny as it may seem, is a sorry pretext for an entire book. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one -- I'm happy I read it in the library."
2,A few laughs and mercifully its over quickly,"This is a strange genre - an autobiography of a fictional character. Add to this that the fictional character is Larry Sanders, a paranoid, insecure, and egotistical host of a late night talk show! Fortunately, the large print face, copious white space and 82 pages of pictures contribute to making this a quick read. The humor would be the sad type of laughing at some obnoxious, insensitive bore, except we are saved from feeling bad about this by the fact that the object of the joke is fictional. This is supposed to make laughing at him acceptable. If you can get into the premise there are plenty of funny jokes."
3,As good as far as it goes...,"This is book which will undoubtedly delight regular viewers of ""The Larry Sanders Show"". Presented as an erstatz autobiography (complete with an identical dust-jacket to the book Larry wrote in an episode of the show) Larry's rambling thoughts read like an extended stand-up show, filled with uproariously funny one-liners and absurd incidents. It is neither an extensive book or a particularly detailed one, though it is loyal to its subject matter and offers plenty of entertainment.The only thing that really disappoints is the fact that it all seems to be over too soon, with gargantuan text size and a proliferation of full-page photographs. For a book based on a show that was so obsessed with the superficial nature of the television world, perhaps it ultimately reaffirms this point unwittingly, or is perhaps is just a little too clever for its own good."
2,What the?!?,"It seemed a good idea to have a kind of treasure-hunt race with sexy models in Belize. Sounded fun to me, and might even provide some ideas for games at a nudist resort. But in the making of this film, apparently the ladies were not told that the title would be ""Naked Island Race."" I'd estimate they're unclothed maybe 10% of the time, and the rest of the time are mostly covered up with t-shirts and thongs. Why didn't they at least wear bikinis, for crying out loud?! And I'm not so much bothered by the raininess, except that the camera lens often has a lot of water drops on it, and what's the deal with the light in quite a few scenes causing such a bad over-exposure? The ladies in this are nice-looking enough, but it's all quite a dreary result......"
5,Great CD!,"Great CD! Karry Kofr's voice is great, but I found the songs stuck in my head were all Gary Nicks'. I never knew I was such a big fan of the mandolin, until I heard Inde' Skies. The ""Midnite Train"" really puts me in such a good mood. For a truly moving, and emotional feel, ""The Finish"" is perfect. In ""The Finish"", there is a subtle nod to the Eagles' ""Lyin' Eyes"", which has always been a personal favorite. The metaphor of singing that song in the mirror is powerful. This is my second copy of the CD. When I found I had scratched my first one, I immediately went and ordered a new copy. Thanks Amazon and thank you Inde' Skies. This is a must for my collection."
2,Needs some serious editing,"I am a fluent speaker of Japanese trying to teach it to my children. There aren't very many options for Japanese teaching aides, so I was glad to see this one and really wanted to like it.CONS: The computer animated dog is cheesy and not integrated with the live action. The narrator mispronounces words and even mistakenly uses the word for grandmother when referring to the grandfather. The workbook that comes free with the DVD is not a workbook, but a booklet that fits in the DVD case and isn't very helpful.PROS: The main characters in the show are obviously native speakers and use normal informal Japanese that children would actually speak. It's cheap.I guess for only $23 this is what I should expect, but I was hoping for more."
1,Wish I could give zero stars,"Complete waste of money and waste of time even watching it.There is like no organization or reason to this video. Yes, it has some basic words for some family members, colors, etc but you can find the same content in a much less annoying form using one of the many free apps available for your iphone.The graphics are awful. The sound is awful, some parts very soft some parts very very loud. The songs are annoying. The boy main character is annoying and mumbles. Yeah sure, in real life people mumble and I guess if you really want to learn to speak a language you should learn how to understand mumbling people but I think that's a more advanced skill. For a kid video, I think it's better to have the actors speak clearly and a little slowly.My child was not entertained by this at all and even I lost interest before the whole thing aired.Overall I would give this a big fat LAME and wish I could return it and erase the memory of it from my mind."
4,Nice gift for the golfers,"I gave this as a gift for my golfing brother and he liked it well enough, his only complaint is he thought it was a bit small inside for holding his clubs."
5,THE ONE,"What could anyone add to the discussion about Stravinsky's own recordings at this late date? All I can say is that the sound is much better than a previous reviewer would have us believe. So it's not the latest DDD recording with all the bells and whistles; I can still hear details here that I never heard on the LP. CBS engineers knew their stuff in 1961, and it shows. Really, all that needs to be said is that this recording is available, and at a decent price. Get it while you can."
1,High School shop class.,"Possibly a mandatory text for class, all information inside can be found elsewhere in more detail at a better price. Simple explanations."
2,"Nice seat, however not what it appears","I bought this booster for my 11/2 year old.The seat is nice however the straps that secure your child do not even go around their waist, instead they come up over the tops of the legs. This does not give a parent a very secure feeling for their child.I also found the tray to be tricky when taking it off and on.It seems more like a toy than an actually baby item.I'm returning mine after having it only 1 day.Iwould recommend anyone buying this seat to take it out the box and see how the 3 point harness is attached to the seat itself, you'll see how the straps are not where they are suppose to be."
2,Doesn't fit on all chairs,I bought this seat and returned it. It didn't fit on our dining room chairs very well. The buckles clip kind of low in the back. I didn't feel this was very secure. My daughter is a climber. I was afraid if she leaned over to far that the seat would flip. We purchased a another one that fits much better.
2,lid comes off,The lid falls off everytime we put our sons food on it> He is 20 months old. Its locks but he can push it off into the floor.
3,Here's the deal...,"I gave this 3 stars because if you are only using it on the go, it works. However, if using it at home it is quite a pain. Like others have said food gets stuck in all the cracks. And even worse it goes through to the chair. Once we had people over and we needed an extra chair. We popped it off only to embarassingly discover food underneath it. So if you want to remove it every time to clean then go for it, but I'd rather spend my time with my son!"
4,good seat but.................,I baught this seat for my almost 2 year old. She refused to sit in the highchair anymore. I loved the seat but had to take it back because the sides of the chair come up too high to fit under the kitchen table. I purchased the booster seat and it is working fine. I would recommend to look under your table to see if the side would fit before purchasing this item.
4,Choose this one over the others...,"I had this chair, but I left it at my mother's house (she lives out of town).So, I thought that I'd try the ""other"" one made by The First Years. I returned it, and I bought another Safety First booster seat.The First Years booster seat was difficult to put together. It was difficult to tell if the seat had ""snapped"" into place. With this chair, on the other hand, it is very obvious whether or not it is put together correctly. Since I leave this with grandparents, I want the chair to be easy and safe, and I don't want to be required to give a lot of direction. This chair is the way to go.I had the first chair for over 6 months, but I used it only occasionally. I keep the chair in my trunk to use at the houses of friends and relatives and at restaurants that don't have high chairs. It is very handy. Now that my daughter is 1 1/2 years, I use only the chair without the tray."
4,A nice alternative to a high chair when traveling,We received one of these as a gift and it has gotten quite a bit of use. It is very handy if you travel because the whole thing comes apart into flat sections. We carried it in a small suitcase on one long trip. We also used it when we visited friends or family. We are currently using it as a booster seat. It is very study and easy to assemble. I agree with one reviewer that food can get trapped in the crevices but that seems to be true of most high chairs. The nice thing about this one is that you can disassemble it and wash the sections in a kitchen sink. Overall it was a very handy item to have and I can recommend it.
5,Great Seat!,"I bought this seat for my son when he turned one, as now he was a big boy and wanted to sit in a chair like mommy and daddy. I LOVE IT! As for tipping over...not sure how that can happen because my son is never still and he has yet to knock it over or make it snap apart. Trust me he does not sit still!! I do check it before I put him in it to ensure that all straps are secure and that the sides are snapped in.It folds up for travel and has an adjustable height seat for when they grow taller.I can not say enough about this chair. It is a great buy and I would recommend it highly!"
1,Sorta liked it until I tried the FP booster,"The ""small compact straps to chair"" element is a plus, but after comparing this to the Fisher Price booster, there's just no going back. This flops all over the place when it is ""folded"" and has many nooks and crannies where food gets lodged, and where, if you just put it in the sink to hose it down, water will get stuck. The straps fall off every time you wash the seat down, and the tray is difficult to get on and off quickly. Just can't stand the thing, really, not after trying a *real* portable high chair."
3,not completely happy,"We bought this booster seat so that we could have our 2 year old at the table now and also to have the room back where the highchair is now. I found that it is really hard to clean up after using this chair. All the food slides down in the corners and under the chair you attach the seat onto. Other than that, he loves being at the table, and I'm glad we could get rid of the highchair."
3,Purchased chair.,This was purchased as a needed item for a grandson who needed a chair to go with a new desk. The price and availability were the factors when making a choice what to purchase. I have used the chair and the quality and durability are their for his needs.
4,"good chair, good value","I found it at my 2nd target store. It was so easy to assemble; under 8 mins. Everything needed is in the box, no additional tools needed. It feels comfortable but only been on it for 45 minutes."
2,Does its job but broke after 2.5 years,"The chair was not as comfortable as I had thought after reading the reviews. The cushion was not great -- as time went on, you could feel the screws protruding through the cushion into your body. But for 40 dollars, i think it is a reasonably good chair. Expect the chair to fall apart in 3 years (assuming average use)."
4,CONFORTABLE CHAIR.,A good price and very good product. Very useful for your PC activities at home or office.
3,Cushion does not last long,"For the price, it's a very nice-looking chair. Easy to assemble, and I liked the back was mesh fabric and this fairly soft. (Although you can't lean back on it.)But I'm very thin and I often spend a lot of time in front of my desk, which means the cushioning in my chair has got to last. This one didn't, and I actually had to buy an additional cushion for it about 6 months after buying the chair new. When I had the opportunity to buy a leather chair for cheap, I gave this one away."
4,Wild About Harry,"Recently found this author when reading historical western romances. She pulls you into her stories immediately, knows her history of the various places/countries/periods in history she writes about, and has you spurring on her heroes/heroines. Her romantic descriptions are not only real but extremely sensual to the point of wanting to be the heroine. Harry is gorgeous! I love her books!"
2,Why?,"That was the question I was constantly asking througout this book. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why anyone was doing anything. The characters were weak, and their motivations were non-existant. The choices they made seemed little more than weak plot devises to stretch the book out beyond a short story into a complete novel. From continent hopping to unplanned pregnancy to early marriage, to other problems, WILD ABOUT HARRY seemed to jump jerkily from one event to another without any explanation. The only reason this book got more than one star was because I did like the Ghost, and it was funny that the only time anyone in this book seemed even remotely real was when they werer chatting with the dead guy. Skip this one."
3,"Interesting, but hard to follow","Todd displays a wide range of historical and archaeological knowledge while addressing migration, identity, and ethnicity in the Europe of the late Roman empire and the early post-Roman period. Unfortunately, the book reads too much like its source: a series of lectures. You can almost see Todd pointing at a map as he makes his points. As his material is not always organized chronologically, the sequence of events is sometimes difficult to follow. A general conclusion would have been helpful. The best thing in the book is the fine color plates showing relics from that era, including gold work and architecture."
4,Better Than Vol.1,"This volume is better than the first, but you must read the entire run, especially vol.3, because it's the best one. Great story, not too good art, but acceptable. Recomended."
1,Does not stick to Tub,"I was extremely excited for this bath ring, which I bought on Bed Bath and Beyond for $24.99. My 6 month old just started to sit up and I wanted to give it a try. This tub will not stick to my bath tub. I had to hold on to the seat at all time, so he wouldn't tip over. I'm glad I didn't spend the $70 plus on Amazon. I wouldn't not recommend this to anyone."
1,Difficult to wash baby...,"I bought this bath seat for my 6 month old, the closed design made it difficult to reach the already hard to reach places. He also kept sliding to the front of the seat, I tried putting a wash cloth down before setting him in but that didn't help. The three decretive shapes left red marks on his belly. So, we used this seat several times and ended up going to Target to get a different brand."
1,Disappointed,"This product shipped promptly and met description. However, I was unable to use it because it would not stick to my bathtub. I believe it is because I have a textured floor and the suction cups would not work. Most disappointing was that I was unable to return this product. Check return policy carefully! The return date was 2 days after I received it. Now I am stuck with an expensive product that is useless.....disappointing."
4,Love it,"It wasn't an easy decision on which bathring to purchase and being that i really would have preferred to get it locally, however none of the major baby stores, departments around here seem to carry them. This one is one of their pricy bath rings, but works great. It seals and stays in the bathtub without any problem and my nine month old is very secure in it, i have been using this ring for over a month and i am very happy with it and speding the additional $ on it."
3,wish it had non skid seat,This works great for my 8 month old. I just wish he didn't slide forward during his bath. I have to keep on sliding him towards the back of the seat. I just recently cut a rubber bath mat to insert it on the inside and that seemed to work well.
3,Thermobaby Bath Ring,"I bought this product because my daughter was getting too big to be bathed in the sink and I couldn't find one that I liked. For starters, I do not have a ceramic tub, the suction cups do NOT stick to the bottom leaving the ring to kind of tip over slightly when my daughter reaches for things. She is 6 months old and weighs 15 lbs. It does serve its purpose in the sense of me being able to wash her without having a slippery baby fall over in the tub but I guess I just expected something more. Who am I to judge anyway, my daughter seems pretty happy in it and doesn't scream to get out so I like it but it isn't the best. I think this product could be improved."
2,Product pictured is not the same as product delivered,"The picture of this product shows abundant space for the child's legs. The product I received is the same upon first glance, but there is a MUCH smaller space between the seat and the top rail. The green part on the actual bath seat is much bigger and makes a much smaller space for my son's legs. I had a hard time getting him in and getting him out was almost impossible. I got this bath seat b/c my son had outgrown his other one (he has some chunky thighs) and this one looked to have a lot of room for big legs. If you have a chunky baby, this will not work for you. Juvenile Solutions: Please update your picture on this site as well as on the box."
3,"Good idea, design far from perfect / practical IMO","The Thermobaby Bath Ring is very well made. It is durable and can fit a wide range of babies up to 18 months. The suction cups on the bottom work well. Here are things that need improvement. If you have a big baby, it is hard to squeeze them in there. We have an 11 month old who we struggle to put in and take out.It would be helpful if there was some part in the top ring that could be opened and latched to slide the babies in. An adjustable cross bar between the two outer bars would be better for boys than the current middle bar."
4,Great seat - WAY less expensive in other stores,"Found this bath seat at Bed Bath and Beyond, and at several other online baby stores for way less than Amazon has it - which is surprising, because in my experience, Amazon usually beats everyone else. However, every other vendor I checked has it for $35 or less (INCLUDING shipping), exact same seat for nearly half the price.I love that it has rounded edges so it's gentle on my babies' tender skin. Great bath seat, just buy it somewhere else."
2,dangerous,This little seat didn't stick to well to the bottom of my tub and i had to hold the back down the entire time. Every time my son would reach forward the back would lift up and almost flip out. its hard to bathe him when your hold the seat down the whole time. Would not recommend.
2,Not good for cleaning baby,"The chair is helpful for baby to sit in and play, though I had to stick a folded towel down the back to make my 6 month old fit snuggly. However, when I went to wash him, I found it was very difficult to wash below the waist. So ultimately, the chair is not very useful for bath time. Maybe a baby bath tub would be better."
1,You should read consumer report,"I think this item has a good purpose but not safe for babies. I got one because it was a good price but never wanted to use this product aftet I saw a bad review at the consumer report about this product for its safety. Before you buy this, reserch it more!"
4,"All honesty, I would suggest to friends!","Hi, I bought this seat about three weeks ago...I probably should have read the reviews first, my mistake, but I have had a lot of luck using this seat. The previous reviews said that the toys on the seat would scratch his belly but we havn't had that experience. He actually likes to play with them since he loves analyzing things to death! LOL They are not big or do much but he gets a little entralled with them which is nice!"
4,Just what I was looking for!,This seat was just what I needed and my daughter really seems to like it. She can play and splash and I don't worry about her slipping and falling into the water. My only problem with this seat is she leans over the bar and the little toys poke her and rub her chest so it's red when she gets out. But she doesn't seem bothered by it.
1,What's Up With the Pricing,"I don't get the pricing on this. First of all the blue model is $56.00 vs. the pink model which is $48.98. The only difference I can see is the color. Secondly, this isn't worth $56. BuyBuy Baby sells them for $25, which is much more reasonable for the product."
4,"I like it, baby did not","This is a great, sturdy product and I think everyone should have one to try. HOWEVER, the first time we used it, my son was scared. I think it is all the water in the tub and it was a bit overwhelming...something I did not think would happen.There's a line on it that says do not fill above and I did not fill water near it so maybe he would have liked it more if we had more water in the tub? I was afraid of him tipping over- which would not have happend- I was just worried, I guess, lol.My son likes to splash his hands in the water and he couldn't in this. I will give it another try with the water deeper and see if he likes it.It is a great product, but costs so much to put a gamble on whether your child will like it or not."
1,sucked,got my product...it was broken...seller said he would replace and send me out another one but three weeks later still havent got it! Called the seller and they said there werent any in stock...am getting refund...or so they said!
3,Not enthused,"Pros: good suction to tub & ultimately keeps kid safe.Cons: seat is slippery & kids slide forward, crushing little boys' private area. Also, the toys are not really that easy to play with...more just for looks."
1,Did not work out for us,I bought this for my grandson. This product did not work out for us. The suction cups will not stick to a tub that has a non slip surface on the bottom. Both tubs at my house and my son's house have non slip surfaces (rough bottom). We're hoping to donate this to someone who can use this.
3,Very moving story,"More the love story of a woman for a friend. This novel struck me as so depressing, melancholy and sad. The situation was just hopeless. Emma would always be the second wife. The final coupling between Shay & Emma was like it didn't even happen. Whatever happened to Maddie & Stu? What happened to Emma's father? Did Emma get to keep her trust fund? If found the story wrapped up too quickly for me and was anti-climactic. The most touching part of the book was the love between Bria & Emma and Bria's children.Shay and Emma had almost no real chemistry. Beautifully written and imagined, but fell short for me."
1,"Wow, did Matt's dog write this book?","Well, the title of this book pretty much describes it. It is about an angel who falls from the sky. Yup, that's about it. It is basically a rip-off of Dante's 'Divine Comedy', as well as 'Air-bud' (the movie of course). An angel falls from heaven, loses it's wings or something, fights Satan in a one-on-one duel with lightsabers and telepathic powers, and then goes out to eat. This book is only worth it if you are his mother, because, well, it is horrible. Instead of buying this book, go buy advertisements that state how you shouldn't read this book."
1,Hmm not quite sure,I read this book in a matter of 2 minutes... the i read it again and again and again. Then i got a headache because i kept searching my mind asking myself what the hell is the point of this story? After the 5th time reading it i threw it in my fire place. It is not good. I do not recommend buying it unless you are in need of some paper to burn.
2,For the fans,"While a good collection of demos, previously unreleased tracks and remixes, there is nothing spectacular about this collection. More than anything, this is a disk for the hardcore fans of Static X who want a complete collection:Highlights: Crash, I'm With Stupid remix, Burning Inside"
2,Why two stars cause only two songs are worthy of stars,Anything but this is like the usual Static X as well as Burning Inside. It is up to your musical taste if you wish to listen to the rest of the cd. This cd is the turning point in there music. Wisconsin and Machine are similar then Shadow Zone is it's own cd then all the new stuff sounds the same. If you like a more main stream sound from Static X this is your cd they change it up alot and most of it is catchy but some does suck listen and find out.
3,Better without the demos........,this album would be a lot better if they'd only not put the demo versions of some previously released songs on it. i'll never understand why bands release inferior and less complete versions of songs that have already been released?!!? who cares what a song sounded like in it's early stages??!!? i don't.but you can tell the band has realized that their fans enjoy the type of sound they produced in their earlier days than their more recent ones. they're even bringing Koichu back into the studio for their next album. could be the beginning of the end for static-x.
4,"Cool remixes, rare songs and b-sides.","If you are a fan, this is a must-have set. I would not recommend a casual listener to buy this, because it is not a regular release, but there are plenty of reasons to pick it up. I do not usually like remixes, but these are done so well and while I always like the studio cuts better, I still find myself coming back to this cd. There is enough solid material on this cd to make it a good value. Some remix/rare song compilations are just rip-offs. I consider this to be one of the best I have ever purchased in that category."
4,I am surprised....,Ignore the bad reviews...This CD is better than the last 2 releases...It's much like WDT.
5,Artists & Ad-hoc'ers too!,"Stables to sheds, huts & houses. I wanted to build a small broom shed behind my 1850s house that would fit in. This book has inspired me...wish I had 3 acres to build ad hoc sheds, dog houses, meditation rooms, etc. Only picture among thousands I have NOT found is a 14th C hermit's shelter, but much that looks like they did. Inspiring for artists and builders...and much needed antidote to too-too-modernist-minimalist ""perfect"" spaces. Add variety, error, rusticity, and naturalness to your next space."
2,Will be returning this book,"I was disappointed in the content of this book. I decided to spend the money to order it after reading the glowing review by Lloyd Kahn, and since Shelter and Homework have been such inspiring collections for me, I thought this book would do the same. It's very dense and the content is not very organized or unified; a lot of collages and a lot of text. Maybe if I could read the Japanese the book would be more interesting and worth keeping. I thought that the photos that were worth a second look were too small and blurry (about 1 inch square) but then there were pages and pages of large clear photos of just junky sheet metal sheds that held little character or design inspiration. Overall, I feel that this book is not worth the hefty cost. There are much better books out there on the subject for far cheaper."
5,wonderful book,"wonderful book too. it is a pity you can't read it because it is japanese, but nevertheless a wonderful book of sheds and other small houses. it makes you want to study japanese."
3,A dance party for the 40 and over crowd...,"This 2 CD set is a compilation of remixes, covers, and maybe even a couple of originals. The whole thing was put together inGermany and a lot of it is in the feel good ABBAish style. OnlyMungo Jerry's ""In The Summertime"" escapes some kind of rework.As one would think the German engineering is in top form. As a curiosity it is kind of neat to see the Euro touch on most of these songs. For a cheap price this is done better than most!"
5,So very CUTE,Had one of these for my son and loved it. Had to get this one for our daughter who will be arriving soon.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This product is from a company called Old Glory, and they DO NOT have realistic sizes.A XL in this sweatshirt = a 6 in young girls clothing (not junior sizing). When I tried to return the item, the company INSISTED that their sizing was reasonable and DIDN'T need further clarification.If you're buying this sweatshirt, be aware that the largest size wouldn't fit a 8 year-old."
5,A Master Storyteller,"I first heard of Richard Bausch when he praised some work of Janis Ian's. I went to see what kind of writer he was, and was pleasantly informed. He really develops his characters. They are real to the reader, and you can be sympathetic toward them even as they bumble and stumble through life ... just like we all do. Not alot of fun & happy endings here, but the stories will touch your heart in a good way."
3,Average,"The high points in this book of stories were attained with some perceptive insights about human relations and the human condition. However, they were not sufficient to overcome an average book."
4,Good stuff (as always),"Got it for an 08 Explorer V6 because the engine seemed a little asthmatic.I'd be lying to you if I told you it made a worlds difference in the performance of the engine. That being said, the vehicle is a little more responsive than it once was - not much different than stock, but appreciable enough to warrant the expense.As for fuel economy, it seems to be about the same, but it could be the ecu still adjusting.If you're still contemplating, just go ahead and do it, you'll be happy with the purchase."
4,"Good, though thick","Solid signaling mirror. Good reflectivity and strongly built. Aiming device in center is a clever means of getting on target; recommend testing under good conditions to set up quickly in poor. This will reside in my camping first-aid kit for normal mirror duty until needed for signaling. Only detraction is the thickness and weight, but strength and quality has a cost."
5,"More Twilight, please!","I finally finished the last of the eighteen books of Maggie Shayne's Twilight series, and all I can say is that I don't want them to end! Talk about being emotionally invested in the characters--wow! Forget the newbies in the movies. Shayne's Twilight books are definitely vamps for the big girls."
3,Hit and Miss,"I find this to be a hit or miss product. When it works, it works great, when it doesn't work as designed its very frustrating. I will say the opener does work 80-90% of the time. What tends to happen is the gripper wheel for lack of the better term, will slip and cause the cut wheel to not line up. once this happends you either have to recut the line (causing shards of alumnium) or it will not cut at all. When it worked it was great for reusing the can to store left overs."
2,AVS-not what they used to be,"I had bought about 20 sets of these through the years and they were always built well. These new units are flimsy, the one even chipped during the installation procedure at the edge which occurred after installation because I checked them out before hand. Would not(after purchasing many units) buy these again. I say my friends Weathertech units are they are far superior in quality."
4,Wonderfully Useful!,As a land development professional (not a PE yet) I find myself using this handy little device more and more frequently. It's very hand for quick calcs in meetings and the field when I don't have access to AutoCAD or a scale.It's very easy to use and I'd recommend it over the more expensive versions out there.
3,If a picture is worth a thousand words....,"What I really love about DREAMS is the illustrations. The interpretations are banal and un-connected to anything. For example, it says that dreaming about needles means means you have friends that appreciate you. This fortune cookie approach is a real put-off.But the pictures are so great that it is worth the set. The artist has put together dozens of little surreal machines and fantastic vehicles that re-combine ordinary objects into wonderful vehicles of transport. A man flying on a sideways apple, a sun that is a hot air balloon, a jack in the box with a star head and more. Great!Card stock so so, cards kind of small, but the overall packaging is really, really nice with thick glossy boxing. Great gift for artists, thinkings, dreamers."
1,Great at first but doesn't hold up,"This product worked great at first & we felt like it was accurate. It's been a little over a year and for the last couple of months, accuracy went out the window. I usually blow on it first because I don't drink & it's been giving readings varying from 0.01 to 0.06. And if I blow on it again, it will give me a completely different result. I've tried replacing the batteries several times but it doesn't seem to help. I am very unhappy with this purchase as now I'm going to have to buy a different tester."
4,I can really feel the traction improvement,I am very pleased with this product. It was easy to install and it seems to be very good quality. It is currently frozen but it is designed to freeze. the added weight is distributed over the whole truck bed and there is still room for cargo. I used to use sand barrels and this took up space and would shift around all the time.There hasn't been any real snowfall yet but I notice the difference in handling in rain and on icy roads.At the end of the winter I don't have to carry all that sand and store it for next year. I just have to pull out the plug and let the water drain out and put it away behind the seat of my truck.
5,ShurTrax Traction Aid for Compact Pickup Trucks,"This item arrived exactly as advertised and was simple to install in my 2005 Nissan (Frontier) truck. Filling it up was a snap. After a few months of use it appears that water is escaping somewhere, although there is no apparent leak - maybe this is normal.The extra weight made a big difference in ride comfort, especially when going over speed bumps and other uneven road surfaces. It also helps to provide that much-needed extra traction on slippery roads (after rain) and has also helped to improve stopping distances - despite the extra weight. I am now waiting for snow to fall, so we can give it the real test."
5,ShurTrax Traction Aid,"Thanks Amazon for the very quick delivery of my ShurTrax. With all the snow this season, it has come in handy. It makes a big difference on my Ranger pickup, and was a snap to install."
5,It works Great!,"Product actually works exactly as it's supposed to. Those that do not understand how to properly hook up their garden hose to this apparatus are absolutely idiotic. This product works great, and is easy to use. Enough said."
2,Bound to get a clunker from time to time,"I have been ordering Kindle books based on reviews and recommendations of other Kindle readers. Maybe this book was just not my cup of tea but I found it to be boring and repetitious. The basic story concept is interesting but gets bogged down in chapter after chapter of sheer nonsense. I would suggest a good editor to tighten everything up; it might have a chance to be a decent read.Sorry, can't recommend it."
3,Lunar Crush - Something Old And Something New,"Some songs on this album are a refreshingly new take on the idea of ""funk."" However, there is a lot of the old advant-garde styles ala Sonny Sharock, Sun Ra and Pharoh Sanders mixed in. This album may turn off listeners not into free-form jazz. More adventurous listeners will like having this in his or her collection."
3,Mixed Emmotions,"Ever listened to an album and come away with the feeling that the stuff you liked about it is the same stuff that you didn't like about it? That's where I am on this one. The production is sparse at best which is exactly what a punk/garage band should aspire to. The problem is, it sounds like effort was put into making it sound sparse and raw. I'd rather that be natural rather than forced. Add to this the fact that the playing is rather ""weak"" or ""timid"" and it makes you have to work at listening rather than just sitting back and enjoying the album for what it is. The songs are OK and enjoyable. The punk ethos is seemingly in full effect which is good if that's what you want to hear. It's times like these that I really miss the band ""Treat Her Right""."
4,Everything you would want in a hammer,"feels good in you hand. Have not had to use it much yet, but unless I write another review assume that it is performing flawlessly."
4,A different perspective of Love,"Interesting perspective of Love. This book although a little short provides the reader an enticing overview on the practice of the Tao of Love. It provides the reader a medium in depth history of Tao in the essence of Loving Making. The bottom line is that A woman's Needs and sexual satisfaction go beyond the skill and technique of a man's ability to perform. Technique and skill is nothing without warmth and the awareness to live in the moment of ectasy is the heart of expression between two lovers. This book offers you the lover to become an artist in the Art of Love making. The presence of mind, the variation of strokes and thrust is just a small taste of the world of Tao of Love and Sex.'"
3,Needs more explanation; explanations are too concise.,"I needed this book for my CPSC 2405 class. My class was warned at the beginning of the semestre, by the teacher, that a lot of the material will be confusing and the book probably won't assist you very much if you don't already have a basic idea of what to do. He was right. A lot of examples are provided. I am gratefull for this. But, his explanations are far too concise and compact for easy learning. This book would be much more usefull, if more time was spent explaining the theories and techniques and not just showing us how to apply them."
5,great book on discrete math,"This is an excellent book for self study. However, there are parts in this book that must be rearranged or deleted. For example, I think Catalan numbers should be deleted. This might be useful for the matrix chaining problem, but that's in the realms of algorithm design (specifically in dynamic programming). Also, I do not understand why Grimaldi sandwiched in a chapter on Finite State Machines between two chapters on Functions and Relations. Maybe he should make a section on languages for FSMs, but I recommend Sipser's Introduction to the Theory of Computation if you want to learn about FSMs."
2,Not an easy read.,Difficult to read. Take this book in small doses. Many examples are not descriptive enough and often leave the reading hanging.
2,Overwhelming,"Grimaldi's examples are very terse. His answers to his exercises are even worse. A study guide that showed the reasoning behind the answers would be very helpful. As it is, his ""solutions"" are often nothing more than the answers.I'm not sure how he's getting good reviews on his book. In my 3 years of college math, Grimaldi's is the most difficult book I've ever had the displeasure of learning from. I can't wait to sell it back."
2,Chock Full of Delicious Proofs,"...and nothing else. Formal proofs are helpful; indeed, they are a key to mathematics... but without ""dulled-down"" explanations and gentle prompting, it is difficult to learn from.A better reference to proofs than an instructional text."
2,Boring,"I sat in my apt. about a week before a test and felt inspired to read some math. Then I opened this book, and it all flew away. That's a good way to describe it. It has a REALLY AWFUL layout! A true inspiration turnoff.The only good thing I have to say about it is that it has a whole bunch of helpful examples."
3,what was I thinking?,I bought this movie because I LOVED it as a pre-teen and would sneak up late just to watch it on HBO. When I watched it the other day I had to laugh because it is completely horrible. lol Terrible acting and cheesy music. Hilarious!
4,Horowitz was good...only.,"Horowitz in my opinion epitomized the typical virtuoso pianist expected by the unknowledged majority. Horowitz was great with some of the most difficult pieces of music. His technique was grand, but his musicality lacked purity and warmth. A great man once said that it is ok to drop your voice at the end of a sentece, but too loose it completely was simply pushing the boundries. Horowitz is not my choice for playing the Kinderzenen, but the rest of the program was his to conquer."
1,WHAT WAS SHE THINKING?,DEAR VANNA..PLEASE DON'T EVER DO THIS TYPE OF HORRIBLE THING AGAIN..IT IS BENEATH YOU. I LIKE YOU SO MUCH BETTER ON THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE
2,Vanna can't act,"I usually can watch and enjoy almost any movie, no matter how bad. I had heard about this from a friend, and since it was cheap, I ordered it. The best I can say is that it is AWFUL. I assume this script was written with Vanna in mind, but the script writer should have considered the fact that vanna's acting ability is less then zero.In one scene near the end, we see Vanna eating a piece of fried chicken, and guess what, she gets out acted by it!"
5,select cuts do it again,"Once again, Select Cuts has proven itself worthy of the honourof remixing the classics. Dub purists and reggae heads alwaysbalk at the idea of touching the past, but sometimes the sacredhas to become new again for fresh ears to enjoy it and thenappreciate the original. In some respects these CDs are a wayfor many DJs and heads to play these tracks out at clubs thatneed a more modern sound or a faster tempo, which is good inthat it allows a wider audience to hear some classic, all be theyreworked.Blood and Fire and Select Cuts both deserve massive praisefor arranging this and for actually giving it a try. Without realaccess to the original tapes, the remixers on here have had touse all their tricks and techniques to re-work some of the bestloved dub tracks. All have made and great efforts and acquitthemselves well in the school of dub. What a treat for some ofthe remixers to be asked to choose something from the mightyB&F; catalog and have a go at it!"
4,I Loved This,"I stumbled on this book quite by accident, with no idea who Sienkiewicz was. What a great thing to stumble upon!I'm a great fan of Walter Scott, and considered this very much in the same vein, a terrific adventure story with heroes and villains, although paced faster than Scott. Particularly, the first 500 pages or so of this big book move very quickly, the events leading compellingly onward through the narrative almost breathlessly.The historical context of the book (Poles v. Germans) is interesting to note. Taking the book in the context of the development of the novel---well, Sienkiewicz isn't particularly interested in the psychology of his characters. The bad guys here are reeeeallly bad. The hero is not only good, he's unbearably handsome, too. But this is an exciting book and I will read more of this guy now that I've found him."
1,Propaganda,"This book offers a historically very inaccurate, one-sided and propangandistic accounts of the Knights, intended to serve the nationalisitc purposes of the author."
3,I guess it works,"I thought this would fit my phone, but I was wrong. I would have returned it, but just to get it out of the packaging was a major chore. I destroyed the packaging trying to get it out. I guess I could buy the adapter to make it fit my phone, but I just gave it to a friend of mine and he says it works ok."
4,Great little device works great when needed.,These things are great. I bought 3 of these for myself and frends to carry in our packs as a backup for phones when hiking & sking. Well it really came in handy sking one day when I went to use my Gopro camera and the battery was dead so I plug the unit in during a break and in about 35 minutes the camera was charged up enough to last 3 hrs and then the next day still enough charge to power up cell phone.
5,Motorola portable charger,"Completely satisified w/ product, price, delivery.I don't always have access to a place to charge my Droid X, so thisportable charger and a spare battery (also from amazon.com) are a must for me."
3,Reviewing the Motorola Portable Charger,It's does the job. Doesn't have the charge to recharge a drained battery. Good for emergency only.
4,Nice Unit,"This is a nice little charger. Rounded edges make it easy to carry,and it appears to be robust enough to take the knocks of travel. It maintains it's charge over a long time and easily covers a 2-3 day trip if you start out with a full battery. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is my girlfriend has difficulty pushing out the slide due to her long nails. I can only imagine what would have happened had she broken a nail using it."
5,Amazing,"I love this, especially the price. Im currently using it on my G1, and a mp3 player, and a bluetooth headset. It charges quickly, and allows my other devices to stay charged on long flights or trips. The greatest feature in my opinion is that it can be pluged in to charge, while plugged into my phone, therfor charging BOTH my phone and the charger at the same time so that i dont need to bring 2 seperate chargers to charge them in hotels and such. Amazing product,amazing price."
1,Outdated Garbage,"Bought this thinking it would be handy for my new Razr, only good thing I can say about it is that I only spent $7.58 on it, because it doesn't plug into the USB charger or the USB port on my phone. Hopefully Motorola comes out with a newer version that is compatible with the modern Motorola phones."
4,Works better that the rest I have tried,I have had this charger for about 3 months now and it works very well. I have tried at least 2 other brands and they could not hold a charge long enough to charge my smart phone.The other brands only gave me half a charge. This product gave me a full charge every time. Just make sure you give it a full charge before you use it. If you have not charged it for 4 or 5 days it may not give you a full charge.
1,IT IS TERRIBLE,"Do NOT buy this product!! I bought it for my Motorola PEBL and it charged it for only 30 minutes, then shut off. Now, it won't charge at all. My relation also bought this product and used it to charge his Motorola RZR. I'm telling you, you don't want to waste your money on this piece of technology!!"
4,Power to the USBs!,"Interesting device. It has an extendible mini-USB output and a mini USB input port for charging. Works well, I used it to charge my bluetooth headset, no problems. One drawback-- it is a bit awkward to use with my bluetooth keyboard, plugging the P790 into the keyboard means the keyboard will not lie down flat! I like it, gave it 4/5 stars."
4,Does not work SO GOOD,"I Bought this for a HTC Touch Cruise, and a least for this phone it would only recharge the battery once time only, before die...Besides that, its very well constructed, good materials. In the HTC the charger get looking with the indicators lights to the oposite side of the screen, so you couldnt see the light if the baterry ran off. But, as i said before it supose to be use with Motorola Phones. In the box saids: Motorola, nokia, Blackberry, SQA, and Q tech.Overall i do recommend this product. GREAT looks btw.C ya."
5,Worked great on the t-mobile mda overseas,"I bought one of these before a trip to Egypt this spring. Along with a spare battery, this charger kept two MDA's working for several days withough having to plug into questionable power outlets/converters.It's definitely handy to have on trips if you've got multiple devices that use a mini usb connector (phone, bluetooth gps receiver)"
4,Such great stories!,"Love the plots, just skip over the graphic sex and violence. The plots are so good, you don't need the other stuff."
4,Ride On Ride On,"Light works great, has a great mounting bracket. However, make sure that some idiot doesn't knock your bike over, since the bracket swivels from side to side to a certain extent, it can break the bracket if your bike falls or knocked over. The light is excellent for city riding."
4,AS CONTEMPORARY AS TOMORROW,"Shi, the fragrance by noted designer Alfred Sung, is reminiscent of his total design philosophy which is classically modern, whether it be clothing, watches or small leather goods. This fragrance is subtle, fresh with a blend of Water Lily and Fig Leaves. Complementing the initial impression is a composition of Orange Blossom and Frangipani, resulting in a soft feminine scent.As one would expect the packaging, both bottle and box, is elegant simplicity. Utilizing three of nature's elements, wood, water, and metal, Sung has created a beautiful design. The bottle, a perfectly rounded glass rests on a dark wood base. On top of the cap is the Chinese symbol for water. Viewed as a whole, the bottle reminds one of a perfect drop of water.The box is a pale blue with the Chinese water symbol on the top panel.This fragrance would certainly be appropriate for day or evening."
2,Disappointed,"I have used this product for quite some time and always purchased it at department stores. When I saw it on Amazon for half the usual price I quickly ordered it. However, when I used it for the first time it did not smell like the product I had been getting and the aroma was weak. I will not purchase it here again."

4,A great book for beginners,"I would recommend this book only if you've been playing hold 'em poker for a month max, or if you've been playing for a while and you keep loosing yet don't know why. The information here is basic, solid strategy that will prevent the novice from loosing all his money. It covers limit, no-limit, tournament and online play, therefore giving the reader a good basic foundation on all the most popular types of Hold 'em. It's also very inexpensive, a plus that's even more enticing for the beginning player considering the prices of most other poker books. But for intermediate players, this is pretty much information you already know intuitively.To sum it up: A good, cheap, introductory strategy book meant for those who have just started playing the game."
1,Almost zero real advise,This is a great book for people that have never in their life wither used a computer or seen a deck of cards. It's also great for 9 year olds because it's written at a second grade level. It's unfortunate that I spent 25 cents on this book when that money would have been better spent on a Sam's Cola.This book is basically a rule book for poker. All of the most basic elements of the game are described in vague detail and the chapters for intermidiate players is insultingly dull. There's an entire chapter dedicated to on-line poker and the author's first bit of advise is to learn how to turn on a computer. That's the caliber of skill this book is aimed at. You know what? If you don't know how to turn on a computer you should just stay away from online poker. I'm done wasting my life on this review.
2,Rehashed and highly disappointing,"First off, Beat Texas Hold Em was written by Tom McEvoy, who has a reputation as a great and talented player, but a horrible writer/orator.Beat Texas Hold Em is essentially a stocking stuffer for the complete novice who has never even read an online article about Texas Hold Em strategy. Yes, precisely; such people do not exist any more. This book is filled with regurgitated and formulaic concepts and tactics and has nothing new to add. I'm quite surprised Cardoza Publishing, which made the authoritative bible on all forms of poker ""Super System"", would bother to publish this scant piece of work. It is neither entertaining nor insightful nor particularly useful.In the very least, it does cover all the bases. If you are interested in making an inexpensive purchase for someone who has recently become hooked on the game but who isn't looking to make poker more than a hobby, this may be of some use. Otherwise, don't bother."
2,Is everyone an Uncle Tom?,"No matter what a brother or sister does to uplift the race, we are still viewed as Uncle Toms. It's not enough that a brother or sister wants to embelish in his or her success without being made to feel that we are trying to be white. Who we select as mates isn't really anyone's business. Just because they chose outside doesn't necessarily mean that they don't have a great impact on the black community. As a member of the African-American community, we should be encouraging one another to achieve and strive to be what we can be. Not stabbing one another in the back and bringing another down. This book is nothing more than a backlash to successful people of color."
1,offensive,"Every black person in this book who is called an Uncle Tom has one thing in common. They are all successful. What Richard Laurence, James B. Lowe seem to be saying with their mean spirited tome is that unless you're poor and humble you're not really black. I find that offensive and unproductive. The authors ought to read Willie Lynch's letter. Their book falls right into what it was talking about."
5,A Must have,This is one heck of a book and I don't understand why any black person would dis it. (unless they are convicted)I've read it several times.
5,le grand macabre,it is the first dvd release that i am aware for. i have known the music for some time and the dvd brought an extra dimension
5,Great way to share the gospel with your kids!,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I LOVE THESE VIDEOS! Yes, they're a little kooky (in the style of Barney, but without the ""perfect"" kids), but hey, the videos are for preschoolers. This is one of the few videos out there that actually shares the gospel in a way that young children can understand. Rob Evans, aka the Donut Man, is great at making up songs that are pure scripture. I've even learned two new memory verses by watching them over and over. I sing the songs when I'm alone, I have to admit."
4,christian mom,This video is an excellent way to get bible stories into your little one's minds by teaching them songs with catchy lyrics. The set is simple but the truths are enduring. I find myself singing the the songs even at times when my kids aren't around. The video features kids of various ages so children are able to relate to the video. The only reason I gave this video 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is slow moving in parts. I'd say this video would appeal most to preschool and early schoolage kids.
1,"NOT satisfied about this item, however...","I actually ordered this product twice. Received wrong tape both times. The problem was that the tape I got in the mail had the same title. I pointed this out both times in my conversation with Amazon, and they removed the title since it was obvious that they never had the correct one from the beginning. I got a refund and it was handled VERY fast, both times. Kudos for the fastest delivery ever! Sorry about the movie, though..."
4,Worth the Price?,"Good book for someone getting started in major gift fundraising. Also a good refresher for the old pro, but same information is availabe in other books at a significantly lower price."
3,Confusing for the Beginner,"Having absolutely no experience with Access or database programs, I thought this book would give me a good basis to work from. Unfortunately, the book seems to assume that you have used a previous version of Access or that you understand the lingo related to databases. There is no glossary of terms, which would be helpful. The book also glosses over many areas with little explaination or detail."
4,Excellent -- just what I was looking for,"I had already been familiar with Alison Balter's books, having purchased one on an earlier version of Access. This book is similar in all the right ways -- extremely accessible (pardon the pun), no fluff, and tempered through years of working with both the programs AND the people who use them. When I am looking for books on database programming, I now look first to see if Alison Balter has written on the subject, having had to plough through some of the other books, from which I derived much less."
4,teach yourself office access review,Purchased book to teach myself what office access could do for me and how to do it.
2,The bad review is right--sorry,"This set is terribly let down by the two leads. Ludwig sounds like an Octavian stretching to become a Marschalin--it's a great stunt but the voice isn't right. Gwyneth Jones is a curse, with hher sqawlly, unfocused singing. So without the two leads, it doesn't matter to me how buoyant Bernstein is on the podium--and in truth he is often too hectic. This must have been a great event live, one of Lenny's Viennese triumphs, but the recording falls apart."
1,Don't buy this one,Bernstein conducts this Rosenkavalier better than anyone else ever did. What a great performance this could have been. But Lenny was rather desperate during the recording: nearly all his singers had problems with their voices or were simply indisposed. Christa Ludwig sounds like the grandmother of the Marschallin and Gwyneth Jones is the worst Octavian ever - a gruesome performance. Only Walter Berry had a good day. This recording cannot compete with Karajans 1956 performance or Soltis Decca recording.
2,pop music,"This late recording of Sarah Vaughan interested me greatly, because I knew her voice aged more gracefully than Ella's, so I really expected not only romance, but also passion from this album. Well, the voice is still here (of course, much deeper than in her sassy and romantic youth, but who cares?)Apparently, majority of people commenting this album online are quite thrilled... I appologize, but I'm not.Maybe it's because I'm primarily jazz-oriented Sarah Vaughan fan, althoug I like some other forms of music as well (blues for instance)... I have nothing against bossa nova and other forms of Latin music, but this is, basically, a pop album with light Brazilian touch and even lighter jazz touch...Even when Sarah goes on short wordless-impro flight, for instance on ""Love and Passion"", it is smothered in electric sounds of elevator music... In my humble opinion.So, merely because I wouldn't like to be too harsh out of my jazz-based biggotry, I'm giving it more than one star."
5,Sarah's Brazil,"There are so many albums out there by the incredible Miss Sarah Vaughan, however, this is one that has always stood out for me. The rhythms, intrumentation and her lovely voice make this CD a delight. All of the songs take you to a far away beautiful place. Songs of special mention are: ""Make This City Ours Tonight"", ""So Many Stars"", ""Photograph"", ""Nothing Will be As it Was"", ""Wanting More"", ""Your Smile"". The music styles range from haunting to reflective. It is a must for any Sarah fan. Brazilian music is a combination of many things, but the best combination in my opinion is Sarah's style and her interpretation of a type of music that will stand the test of time."
3,THE LAST VAUGHAN ALBUM RELEASE -- AND IT'S WORTH EXPLORING!,"When this record was released in the 80s Vaughan's knowing vocal style had ""mellowed"" yet was still in fine shape for this showcase. My favourite is ""So Many Stars"" which builds to its ultimate climax with poise and grace, much like a Vaughan vocal performance. It didn't hurt to have a lyric by Alan & Marilyn Bergman (""The Way We Were""etc.)! Elsewhere, we find the dark reflection of ""Photograph"" sung as only Vaughan could sing it, and ""It's Simple"", a lovely melody-laden track that lingers long after the music has finished. For a summation of Sarah Vaughan's voice at this stage listen to the haunting ""Something More"". Sassy was a rare jewel. Even at the end of her lengthy career she dazzled with perfect comand of her vast vocal resources! KDP"
4,what's this sound like?,"I can't quite put my finger on it, really. I agree with lots of people that you can see some Weezer influence in this album, but there's definitely a lot from other stuff(mainly things that were somewhat mainstream in the 90s) in there. It seems like one of those odd mixes that's a bit familiar at the same time. I met him once, nice guy, and he seemed to know what he was talking about when discussing this album as well, which made it more enjoyable after I heard it. Now I listen to it twice as much. And if you have any chance of seeing him live, do that too."
5,The best I've heard in a long time!,"Val is emo at it's best. His voice and lyrics are both comforting and disturbing. I lose myself in the music everytime I listen to the album. There's something for everyone. The music is so intimate so you may want to listen to it alone with the stereo turned all the way up. Amazing stuff people, pick it up if you can. Check out Val's website for more great info on the beautiful and sexy Val Emmich!"
4,Some of the best indie stuff out there,"On Val Emmich's ""Slow Down Kid,"" he uses music that expresses a myriad of emotions, ranging from the tender, heartwrenching angst of Ben Folds and others to the impassioned, burgeoning upheaval of so many young artists today with whom the world just doesn't seem to sit correctly. He cleverly satires his television acting career in ""Rat Race,"" sardonically mocking the conflict between earning so much and losing oneself in such a faceless, image-obsessed field. He show his fire burning withing with the first single, ""Shock,"" and wraps the album perfectly with ""Slow Down Kid,"" a moving piano-backed piece with enough vocal power to summarize the entire effort. Val's album is a definite must for any fans of the whole emo scene...or anyone just wanting to catch a glimpse of a new musical power on the rise. Check it out.."
5,A Thinking person's mystery,"Not a book for someone who wants a story with slam-bang action, sex, rough stuff and smart repartee which can be read in 90 minutes. This is a complex mystery which unfolds slowly and involves issues of duty, honor, integrity, respect for tradition and reverence for the gods challenged by duplicity and greed, in a society existing thousands of years ago peopled by characters who, under different names, exist today. The author seems to know about the way people in that time lived and behaved. The book involves people who actually existed; their names and likenesses come down to us through history. If the events in the story did not actually happen, they could have, and the characters the author gives us would have reacted as they do in the book. This book requires the reader to contribute time and thought to the story; if one does so the reward is well worth the effort."
4,Works perfectly for our shop,"I bought this photo studio to take pictures of our small precision parts that we manufacture because it was getting difficult controlling the shadows from our overhead lights. This booth really solved our problem because it blocks out all the light from above and brings in the light from the sides. I wish the lights were just a little brighter, but overall, I would definately recommend this product. We make parts out of aluminum that are typically smaller than a quarter and to be able to take super up-close pictures has been difficult in the past not only because of shadows but if there is too much light, the part gets too shiny; so light control is very important."
2,It might have been good if ...,the one light bulb had worked.Only one light worked and Amazon was great to give me a refund. I used the refund to buy another brand with different light bulbs.
4,Good starter unit,"I bought this unit to photograph items for e-bay sales. It is a definite improvement over using an ottoman and traditional incandescent lamps as I have in the past. The price was good, although the lamps are fairly flimsy (as other reviews have pointed out). Overall, it performs well for what I intended it to do."
3,"Does the job well, but the add on stuff is cheap","Overall this does a decent job of giving you a nice, evenly lit place to photograph small items. The included lights work well despite getting very, very hot (but what lights don't). My only gripes are with the background sheets having huge creases in them (I'll have to try the iron method some people are using) and the nearly useless camera stand included.UPDATE: My initial review was pretty harsh due to me receiving an opened unit which was taped back together to appear new. I left a poor review here as I misread the page and thought it shipped from the manufacturer. While looking into it I did notice mine was shipped from just a random Amazon seller thus making it unfair to the company and have updated this review accordingly."
1,"is it 'Photo Studio'. ha, ha, ha!","I even did not understand why it is called 'Photo Studio'. Nothing common, wast of money! Yes, it is cheap, but when you buy a pen for 50c, as minimum you expect that you can write something with this cheap tool."
3,Just okay kit,"Tent is well made. Lights are cheap and fragile. The light outer housing rings fall off all the time. May have to secure with some kind of reusable substance to hold them in place. Lights could be brighter, but can compensate with camera setting. Recommend to less fussy users."
4,not liking the lights,Well its hard to get the creases out of the back ground even iron them.. the cords on the light stands pull the lights away from the box cause its heavier then the lights themselves.. It folds up great but needs more work on the lighting part..
3,it's great until you have to replace the light bulb,"can anyone tell me how to replace the light bulb? one of the lights hit the floor and the bulb blew out :( i unscrewed the cap but the bulb doesn't unscrew nor pull out.this is an ok studio, it does what it needs to do. didn't come with instructions but it's not hard to figure out. the light stands are really light so make sure you don't drop it on the floor! no instructions means there's no way to find out what kind of light bulb replacement it needs (if i can ever get the bulb out).i bought mine from DTX International Inc."
3,"lights are good, tripod is weak box is great and portable but","lights are good, tripod is weak box is great and portable but the fabric doesnt easily cover line of sight.If the fabric covered the back ground it would be excellent.i have my own tripod so i didnt care about the bad tripod. I like this and will use it. GREAT bargan."
5,"Excellent movie, excellent quality, excellent service",This is a movie I had seen years ago and was part of the Hallmark series. My interest was rekindled recently after seeing Charles Durning on TV in an NCIS production. The VHS was of excellent quality -- I don't believe it had ever been played.
2,Not without merits!,"As an experienced manager in Asian markets I see this book being not without its merits. However, it is based more on hear-say than actual management experiences in Asia! For the novice to Asia it gives a good overview of what might have shaped consumer behavior. It falls short of acknowledging that Asian consumers quickly assume new roles outside of their traditional attitudes, more geared towards Western-style consumer motivation. Market realities quickly outlive the authors' assumptions already! Maybe the authors try too hard to construct fundamental differences, where there aren't. Looking closer, much of that are rather local facets of doing business in a global marketplace."
3,Did the crisis change anything?,"Good textbook -- actually very similar to Shutte's other books written over the years. Few real-life Asian company examples, which is disappointing. Also never answers the question -- did the crisis change anything, really? Looks like it is business as usual."
2,No real pearl here.,"I was really hoping that this book would give me some real insights into Asian consumer behavior. Perhaps I hoped too much. Like what the other reviewers mentioned, it lacked examples, particularly on the effects of the 97' crisis. I would be the first to admit that good consumer behaviour books are hard to come by, but I really expected more - what this book does is actually give you some background on the asian culture and fit in bits of consumer behaviour terms in between. A summary would probably be: Asians thinks more about status than self actualizing themselves; and of course less ""individualist"" whatever that means. No real pearl in this book."
5,Fantastic Illustrations!!!,"This clearly isn't a book for light hearted drug legalization activists. It's neither pro nor con, but does seem to offer a darker look at the effects of drug use. This book is just pure fun, with phenomenal illustrations from Steven Cerio."
4,Timmy gives it a paws up,"My finicky daschund/chihuahua mix dog, Timmy, readily eats this food and digests it well. This smaller rolls (1 lb) are much easier to work with than the larger rolls if you have a small dog. Also, the smaller roll is more likely to stay fresh until you finish using it. We have tried the beef rolls. Upon opening the first initially, I was struck by how much it smelled like real human food."
5,love it,"Chad Everett was the young handsome surgeon who practiced at a medical center on a college campus. Each episode in the Medical Center tv series was young and fresh. Anyone who loves a good medical drama will love this series. It also had lots of popular guest stars and every episode made you want for more. I'm so happy it is now out on DVD. Medical Center was very popular in the early 70s and the show reflected that time. The series might seem dated now, but it was a good medical drama in its heyday. For the devoted fans of Chad Everett and Medical Center, it is a must buy series."
2,Not pleased with the product.,Majority of the episodes do not play. This is the first time I've ordered DVDs online. I probably won't order DVDs online again.
3,"Excellent tv series, lousy DVD","Chad E. - so suave, so handsome - Dr. Gannon had it all. Loved that show and couldn't wait for the DVD to come out - it had been decades.... However, unless it's my DVD player/hook-up, I have to turn the volume into the upper 50's-mid 60's to be able to hear loud enough for clarity (my other VCRs and DVDs are not like this so I don't think it's the DVD player - obviously something with the formatting of the DVD playing into the box). Picture quality is just fine. After such a long wait, I'm dissappointed with this; but, overall, loved this show, still do and it's worth watching it all over again."
4,NICE JOB WB!,"Warner Brothers has done a really nice job packaging this First Season set of Medical Center. The transfers are clean and sharp, and the sound quality is good as well. More importantly though we get to relive(or see for the first time) some serious TV drama from this time period. Although most of it is dated and a bit melodramatic, that is part of the fun! The outstanding roster of guest stars is the best part for me. I just wish there were some extras/commentary to accompany this great little time capsule. I look forward to purchasing the Second Season of Medical Center when it becomes available. Recommended."
1,Medical Center Season 1,"Once again,another dvd set that all disc comes up disc errors,for $46.91 i expect product to work.I filing complaint with BBB &DA office.Don't Buy from amazon,they suck!"
3,Dissapointed in the construction,"This was our second grinder like this. We have been using one exactly like it for pepper for over a year with great results. Based on that we decided to get one for salt as well. It looked fine, but the threads in the plastic adjustment knob were stripped out -- the first time I used it to gind salt for a dish the knob came off and the salt poured out onto my food. My husband was able to repair it by embedding a metal nut in the knob. I suppose we just happened to get a bad one. The first one works just fine."
3,Enjoyable but...,"I haven't yet had the chance to hear ""Weave the Apocalypse,"" so this is my first experiance with this legendary band. Well...there are some good points to this album, like some weird riffs, sweet solos and nice grooves, but this whole thing sounds a little too ""core"" to me. The vocals don't please me too much, but luckily I generally consider vocals much less important than music. There's not enough thrash energy in it, and it seems as though they're just kind of cruising along in each song. Its much better than average, just based on the tight musicianship, but I think that they must have done much better."
4,Great Re-Usable Targets,"These are a bit more expensive than cheaper paper targets, but for those of us with poor eyesight, these are perfect for judging the effectiveness of your aim. The added benefit of the little plugs makes this so much more fun than a lot of work to take a target down and put up a new one. Worth the money and great visibility, what more can you ask for with immediate feedback."
4,An interesting spin on an old idea.,"Set in a shattered earth sort of back-drop, this game involves some very dark supernatural themes, combined with cybernetics. It reminded me more of Kult than anything else, with a heavy dose of Rifts and a bit of Deadlands: Hell on Earth thrown in. The mechanics are difficult to explain, so I'll refrain from comparing. Playability is surprisingly smooth . . . but the esoterica of the lore associated with the premise is a little too thick. The publisher does seem to have great plans and expectations for the future, however - so it will hopefully be well-supported. Layout of the book reminded me of White Wolf, more than anything else. Appearance is definitely impressive and the writing is more than a little above average . Even if you're not a gamer, this book is a good read. I don't regret dropping the money for it, and consider the first sourcebook (""Wastelands: Beyond the Outposts"" to be worth the expense as well)."
2,Not what I bought,"I ordered this item and everything was perfect, however when I opened the box, instead of the bamboo wands I received just plastic ones."
5,Loved this book,"This was a wonderful book - loved the story line. This book could be read by young teens with no problem. I hated to see the story end - got so involved with the characters.Recommend to anyone who loves a good story about life in rural America.Betty Rhodes""Keeper of the Celtic Secrets"""
5,Fishing for Trouble,"Robin Hardy's smooth, relaxed style provides a pleasant and charming read. She weaves amiable characters into predicaments that face many Christians. Our hero, policeman Sammy Kidman has a flare for flirtation, mischief, and misfortune. He's a novice Christian trying to stave off the temptations of a sinful life. Even in the predicted calm of vacation, there's plenty temptation to go around.Ms. Hardy relies heavily on scriptural truths to portray an allegory of New Testament hope. Fortunately for the reader, she accomplishes this without being unduly preachy. An example lies in pages 135 - 137, wherein a character plainly discusses supernatural encounters. He begins by acknowledging, ""There's a lot we don't understand, and strange things happen on the threshold between life and death.""Like the Lystra series before it, the Sammy books provide high-quality, moral alternatives to mainstream romantic novels."
1,"Price Isn't Bad, But...","At roughly $1/shell, the price isn't bad. However, the number of shells that the crabs actually use is quite low. There are lots of places online that specialize in hermit crab shells and have very precise measurements, as well as giving you the ability to pick out shells that crabs actually like. Why pay for a little conch shell that'll sit empty when most (commonly kept) crabs prefer turbos or murex?"
4,awesome,"awesome. I just wish it was a complete set like it stated because it does not have season 1. overall, glad it has most of them."
3,a corny series,"Although I have just watched the first two of the seriers, (as well as the first, not part of this series). I felt that the movies had it's moments of jumpyness, but I still felt that they were corny.I did enjoy them, but I felt it was hilarious when the corn started to kill people. I also felt that how people died was completley unrealisitic. I mean I didn't expect it to be completely realistic obviously. But it was so unrealistic, it was almost humourus. And as well as the monster in the end. I was like, ""that's it"" I felt it looked like a really angry big booger. I laughed.Not a fav series, at all. But so corny, it's intertaining. Fun to watch every once in a while. But not on my watch regular list"
1,CHARGE PROBLEM - DON'T BUY IT,"I bought JABRA A210 in December/2008.As reported from others custumer, this product simple don't charge.I really recommend you to read the others feedbacks before buying JABRA."
1,Not satisfied,"Adapter worked for about a week but now won't charge. Tried calling Jabra but never got through. E-mailed them for a ""return authorization number"" and no one has replied. Looks like I'm stuck with a useless piece of junk."
2,Try something else,Got this adapter for a non-bluetooth phone. A bit of static and noisy. I also have a bluetooth phone and my Scala 500 works perfectly with the Samsung A950. Don't think its an ideal match between the Scala and the Jabra.
1,Horrible,"It did not work. I sent it back, got a new one, and the new one did not work. They emailed me saying they would refund all the money and they discontinued the item. No other contact was made."
2,Static on the other end,"I am using this device with a Polycom landline phone.Trying the 3 settings I can get a decent connection on my end with a separate Bluetooth earpiece, where I hear the other party fine with little noise and no echo.But on the far end, even landline to landline, there is an annoying whine and some echo, no matter what the setting. This isn't good enough, I prefer to use the corded headset.I am returning this product to Amazon."
1,Flimsy connector wiring,"After about 1 month of use, as I have read in other reviews, I can tell that the connector wire from the phone to the unit has a poor connection at the end that comes from the A210 unit. If I wiggle it I can sometimes get a clear and louder connection, otherwise it is a low and muffled reception. That is not what I expected to pay for. I read the reviews but I had to see for myself."
1,Item is discontinued by Jabra - batteries likely to be dead,"I ordered this adapter from a retailer listed on the Amazon site, and received it promptly. However, when I went to set it up, it wouldn't take a charge. I contacted Jabra and the technician explained that the batteries in the unit lose their ability to take a charge if the unit is stored too long before initial use. Nothing to do about it since the battery is not replaceable."
1,Product never worked out of the box!,Product NEVER worked out of the box. I also called customer service for Jabra/GN Netcom and they indicated that they couldn't help me because they don' sell this product anymore -thus not able to support this bluetooth adapter. Problem was still not resolved and I currently have a product that does not work??Mark
1,"Jabra A210 does not work, NOT happy","I purchased a Jabra A210 a couple of weeks ago from eBest4Less when I got it home I opened the package. The instructions told me to charge it and this would take aprox 2 hrs, after 2 hrs it was not charged and it would not turn on so I plugged it in again and charged it overnight. In the morning it still would not turn on.I emailed ebest4Less and they promtly emailed me back and said they would replace it if I had not opened the box, well if I had not opened the box how would I know it didn't work. Now I have to send it back (at my cost) to the manufacturer,who tell me they will try to fix it. So I bought a brand new Jabra A210 that doesn't work and no one wants to replace it, so I'm not very happy with my purchase and can't review the product because I've never used it."
4,I guess I'm one of the lucky ones,"so far i havent had any trouble with this adapter. i use it to connect a Plantronics Explorer 230 headset to my xbox 360, it works as well as i could hope it could work. i havent tried it on a phone yet because i have an LG 10000 Voyager which as some of you know is already bluetooth ready. if i do how ever use this on a phone i'll update this review and post my thoughts on that issue.i love this little adapter, i got it for an excellent price elsewhere low enough so that even if it didnt work i wouldnt even bother returning it.no problems chargingno problems pairingno problems hearing people or them hearing meminimal static (i attribute that to the fact i'm not using a jabra headset)it comes with a little velcro sticky pad so you can stick it to your device (in my case the battery pack on my controller)"
1,RUN AWAY!!!,"I bought this item @ a local retailer, was happy cause i got it on sale (probobly clearance) well it worked 2 days then the wire going into the unit it self would get static if touched! I can not find my receipt, so i e-mailed jabra & they are acting like this isn't an issue! wanting to know how many phones i tried, if i tried more than 1 headset, etc.... i will prolly get no where or if they do accept a return the S&H Charges will be stupid & not worth replacement! Just get a nice wired headset, less $ spent & less headache!"
3,Jabra A-210 Bluetooth Adapter,"This is the third A-210 Adapter that I have had. The first one that I bought, lasted through the one year Warranty Period & for some reason, it just stopped working, probably when I inadvertantly reversed the Charger Plug into the Unit. The second one that I purchased, lasted only a couple of weeks & malfunctioned for the same reason. I called Jabra & sent them both units & they returned me two NEW units in just a few days. The company seems to be helpful but there are some design flaws in the charging of these units. The unit works well with the Jabra Headset that I bought, however, any more problems with these adapters, & I will change to a Bluetooth Phone"
1,Buy a Bluetooth Phone,I bought the Jabra a210 adaptor hoping that I could use one of the fancy new wireless headsets. I went to Best Buy with my LG VX6100 and bought the adaptor and Motorola HS850 headset. After using them twice I decided to return it. People couldn't hear me and I couldn't hear them. It just wasn't worth it. If you want to use the wireless headsets go but a bluetooth phone and don't spend the 50 or 60 dollars on this crap.
3,Doesn't play stereo on Cingular 8125,"I had hoped that this would provide stereo sound on my phone. Regrettably, it only produes mono low-fi sound. Probably works great for those few remaining people in the world with a non BT phone who simply want it for phone calls."
1,"Will it work on other devices, such as a portable CD player?",Has anyone ever tried connecting this device with a bluetooth headset to a portable CD player (Sony or Memorex). It seems like all wired headsets break down and/or have poor connectivity. I would buy one if it would work. I would be interested in any info you have.
3,Doesn't work with all phones,"The adapter works great for LG and Motorola phones, but for other brands it is mediocre. I tried using it with an Audiovox phone and after every use it had to be reprogrammed to the Bluetooth headset. After reprogramming, the sound quality was scratchy and had a terrible echo."
3,Jabra Bluetooth Pitfall,"I used the Jabra adapter to enable bluetooth connectivity to my newer Motrolla/Nextel i860 cell. While the connectivity established between headset and cell phone was excellent, the answer/disconnect botton on the headset that I purchased did not work at all interfacing through the adapter. I then bought another headset and tried that with the same results. I returned the adapter and bought a new bluetooth enabled phone - negating the need for the adapter altogether. Now my headset works well without any problems."
2,Worked but then didn't,"The adaptor worked fine for a week, then either this adaptor failed or the headset failed and would not work any more."
2,Marginally works.,"I bought the Jabra A210 Bluetooth Adapter to pair with my Motorola wireless headset (HS810). It paired easily with the headset, and seems to transmit audio well from the phone to the headset. On the other hand, it does a really poor job of transmitting my voice from the headset mic to the phone; people on the other end say that my speech, even when speaking loudly, comes through as though I'm way off in the distance, so much so that it's not a workable solution at all. I've gone back to the wired headset, and will wait for the price of bluetooth-enabled phones are widely available and less expensive."
4,Jabra Bluetooth Adaptor,"It works great, is small and helped to get me into Bluetooth capability at a lesser price than paying full retail on a Bluetooth compatible phone since I was still almost a year away from being able to get a new phone under my contract"
3,Jabra A210,"Product works ok, but not the greatest. It makes a buzzing noise in the background. The bluetooth built into a cellphone works a whole lot better."
1,Won't pair; poor support,"This product will not pair with my hands-free system. I called Jabra's tech support to find out why and what to do. I got someone after a very long hold time. She did not know (or could not communicate) anything beyond what was in the scant user guide. I asked for and got a supervisor who was unable to provide any additional help. After an hour, they said that the second level tech support would get back to me within a day. It has been over two weeks with no call-back."
2,Worked but sound is bad,"This product worked with my LG VX4500 Verizon phone. However, everyone who has talked to me through the Jabra has complained of the poor sound quality. They say I sound like I am in a well. I wrote to Jabra one week ago but have not had a reply."
4,Works great but...,"It doesn't come with 2 sided tape to stick it to your phone, it comes with velcro and that doesn't hold all that well. Other than that it works great! I would certainly recommend it."
3,"Go for Bernstein, not the singers","This performance dates from Lenny's honeymoon with the Vienna State Opera, and it shows in the buoyant, often hyper playing--the musicians never had a conductor like this before! But Fischer-Dieskau couldn't be more wrong for the role, with his dry timbre, barking staccato delivery, overacting, and lack of range. This is a buffo role but also a wise one, the closest Italian opera ever got to Hans Sachs, but here the longings of an aging man are seen as farce. Eveyr other role is sung well enough, but even if I didn't love the classic EMi Karajan performance with Tito Gobbi, I owuldn't be able to like this one."
2,This sucks,"This cd (stinks). It's not very good at all. ""Ephedrine"" is a decent song, and so is ""Nanu"". That's pretty much it. Everything else is ridiculously unoriginal and generic. Like ""Peace Officer"", it's sort of a Rage, Tool, and maybe Korn song all rolled all into one. I hate Korn, but let's just say that these guys are not even one millionth as good as the bands they imitate. They have very little talent. Peace Officer just makes me mad, because it's just so horrible and unoriginal. It's trying to be political,but it's just whiny crybaby (crud). I hate this cd. Nathan Wallace can't sing well at all either."
5,I like chicken.,"This is an amazing CD from an amazing band. I know everyone else hassaid something along the lines of ""These guys kick ass;&quot so Iwon't say it, even though that's true. However, I have to say that this is honestly one of the best CDs I've ever heard. The guys sound like a cross between Tool and Deftones, but with their own style mixed in. The CD has some of the most interesting vocals I've ever heard, sounding angelic at one moment and demonic the next. There's really only one word that can describe these guys, and it's ""AMAZING!"" These guys have me traveling 3 to 4 hours just to see a 40 to 90 minute concert set. More power to 'em!"
3,eh.,really solid -- just not good enough for the money.for 1/10th of the price:Plantronics MX500i 3-in-1 Headset -- so clear! great listening and talkingJabra C510 Corded Headset - nice n loud -- a touch muffled but nice volume.
2,Do not use with a cell phone!,This is not a state of the art headset. There are numerous problems with both the unit and the company. The boom phones are made with weak wires and plugs do not fit well. An adapter is need to hook up to most cell phones which creates a third wire. Their phones create a terrible feedback even when they are connected properly. Their microphones are truly excellent as long as you are not moving to disturb the connection. After numerous tests with different phones they at times create an echo effect for the person you are trying to speak with. The adapter method they use is ill conceived in that they are meant to work (with extra cost connectors) with all phones yet there is a problem inherent with any cell phone use. These headsets should be for desk use only and constructed as such. Their advertising is misleading. Light weight should be an excuse to sacrifice dependability.
1,Piece of junk,"First of all the microphone does work well. Voice quality was much improved....people couldn't tell I was on my cell phone. I loved it at first. BUT, it's the worst made thing on earth. Plastic over the head thing broke twice....I've replaced adapter used to plug into the cell phone 4 times. It works well when it's working...which isn't for very long."
1,HORRIBLE service!,"The Boom purchased for work. Speaker stopped working. Took 2 weeks to reach someone to arrange for it to be returned and repaired/replaced. Over 3 months later, still waiting for repaired product/replacement to arrive. Last updated in Dec 2012. Customer Service said ""sorry, we've been very busy."" Since Dec 2012, no response to requests for status update and ETA or product deliver."
3,DISAPPOINTED,"I selected this because it was supposed to be ""invisible"".I followed instructions, watched a tutorial, did severaltests. Expected adhesion and ""clean"" appearance tooriginals and did not get that. Went out of my way topurchase a product that was reportedly appropriate forsurface. Paper was transluscent: everything shows up!"
1,Bad fit!,When I received the product there was a knot in it and it is very stiff so it fits funny on your face. Wish it was made of cloth instead.
2,Large and not easy to use,It does not hang well on any keychain. It is large and does not open and close easily.
1,buyer beware,I purchased this item for work. It has capability to use password protect on part of drive and leave other section open to 'public'(you can select size for each).I used one time then went to use a second time and it's no longer funtional - keeps coming up error and cannot access drive.It now sits on desk as reminder of silly impulse buys gone wrong. Nice design though to bad it doesn't work.
4,"Great, except wide","Unit comes bare bones no packaging or manual. Worked great, plug and play. One warning if your computer's usb connections are not flush but instead sub set into your computer chasis, then this is too wide to make a connection. With the one computer I had this trouble with I simply bought a USB extender cable for $6. The cable plus the drive is still great value."
4,Works Great!,"Had no formatting or usage problems. Plug and play right out of the box, plenty of available memory and the fact you don't have a cap for the USB end to keep track of is a serious bonus."
3,Sub-par Stern,"This must be a later-career Stern recording-- there's a definite lack of consistency here. Retaining his brilliance on the allegro movements, Stern has little fluidity in the more expressive passages. Listen to the largo from Winter for an example of this almost perfunctory delivery. It's a shame too, for Isaac Stern was one of the best violinists of his generation. Stern's 1950s monaural COLUMBIA recordings stand as testament to that.Pass on this one."
4,Quite good,"I was really surprised by this film. It starts out kind of lame, even Steve Austen seems kind of lame.Fortunately, it takes a turn for the better and I really got into this film. When it was done, I wish it wouldn't have ended.Steve's character had real depth, his dialogue was well written and delivered as well.While the film is quite similar to karate kid, it was still an enjoyable viewing."
2,Lousy movie,"I wasted my money and time on this movie. It's phony and the plots, to me goes nowhere. I like Steve Austin as a wrestling-entertainer, but as far as acting, he should stick to what he knows. I would not recommend this."
2,This movie seems very familiar...,"I loved this movie...back in 1984 when it was called THE KARATE KID. I think I would have liked it a little more if Steve Austin made the boy ""wax on-wax off"" something."
2,ok?,the movie wasn't as good as i though it was going to be. the movie to me was to dull.no excitement in it.
3,Not a bad movie,"I bought this movie because Stone Cold Steve Austin is in it. The movie itself is not bad, not an academy award nominee by an means, but enjoyable just the same. Similar in some ways to Karate Kid movies, only substitute wrestling with karate."
4,My favorite after shave,"Been using this for years, since it cost much more. This is a very good price"
2,Weak,"This product has little or no fragrance, it does not feel like after shave on my skin. I do not recommend irrespective of the price."
1,Stupid book for losers.,"Really a winner of a loser book. No really this is for those that read it already cause I didn't listen either. How could a book about choppers be that bad. Well I would say representing everyone that read this book. To go out and buy a Magazine, yea any magazine on bikes will do. This book is being recycled, what a waste of wood products."
2,Buyers digest!,"If youre planning to BUILD a chopper from scratch, this is a pretty useless book. But if you are planning to buy all the parts over the counter and assemble a kitbike by yourself this book will probably be helpfull. It contains some good information (for the novice) about rake and trail, but that information is availible from almost all choppershops on the net today. This is only MY opinion, im sure there are some people out there that find this book helpfull!"
2,Wait!,If your looking for a book to teach you how to assemble a kit bike...this is it. It doesn't offer much help for someone looking to build their own bike from the ground up.
4,not bad,"could show more detail on rhd trans,and on exhaust building. wire diagrams are ok. rhd with belt and chain drive. also on welding on brackets for rear brake cal."
5,Chopper build,Good book for anyone that is thinking about building a customer chopper. Even for the verteran builders...this book has been added to my library and will be used as a guide during my build.
4,Informative but short,"Some books are just plain too short and this is one of them. It's around 90 pages, though it feels even shorter. It's a series of 8 examples, about 10 or so pages each. Each walks through a very well illustrated example of taking a photo and either fixing it's flaws or tweaking it to have a more arty effect. One example is about making a panorama, in what seems like a very tortured way.The perspective of this book also bothered me. It's written from the perspective of someone who understands what needs to be done to a photo but doesn't understand how to get Photoshop to do it. If that's where you are, then you will like the book. But I think the majority of us need to start with analyzing an image to find out what needs to be done. And that's not in this book."
3,Good and bad (and very bad),"The book is simply comprised of 8 examples of work done by 8 different people working independently. You will quickly come to the conclusion that the only thing that most of the 8 ""authors"" were trying to do was to impress the reader on how technically proficient they are in using Photoshop, not necessarily showing the reader how to accomplish something. If this wasn't bad enough, the examples used were mostly very lame at best. To make matters worse, whatever they accomplished is now completely out-of-date as all examples were done in Photoshop 6, 7, or CS.You may ask me ""Why in hell did you buy the book?"" The answer is simply: one of the 8 examples in the book is Thibault Granier's ""Bloody Mallory"" - a matte painting of an eerie abandoned church done for a low budget movie.Although his Bloody Mallory tutorial is available on-line, I wanted a hard copy. The price of the used book was worth it."
4,Gregg At His Best,"Before this CD was released I wore out 4 vinyl copies of this record.I saw Gregg Allman in a little room at the Chase Park Plaza in St. Louis when he was touring in support of ""Before The Bullets Fly."" There were probably less than 1500 people there and we were treated to the best live performance I have ever seen by Gregg Allman.Perhaps over-produced but what act wasn't in the late 80s? This is clearly the best selection of songs Gregg Allman has released. There is not a weak song on this CD. Everything from discussing his ""Demons,"" to pining for lost love on ""Island,"" this overlooked record is a must for Allman fans.Gregg surrounded himself with the very best rock and roll musicians found anywhere for this project, and it shows on this record."
5,ONE OF MY TOP 20,"I have noticed a lot of different views from people on this cd. Some people love it some do not, myself I find the words to these songs are of high quality. I think Dan Toler's guitar playing is excellent, and of a very high quality. Same goes for Gregg's voice and organ playing, the band is very tight. I also find the overall sound quality to be top notch, this to me is one of Gregg's best solo albums. I think this cd is well worth buying, all the years I have had it I still play it a lot."
5,Best of Breed,"IMHO Gregg's best recording and true High Fidelity. In the 70's I used to trudge around The Last Record Album to audition speakers for bass response (the days before subs were invented). 2 minutes of One Love Stand would tell my ears all they needed to know. Night Games on this CD will do the trick. If Dan Toler don't get you air guitarin', you got nothin'. Highly recommended."
3,OK set of speakers,The speakers are decent. Good quality and sleek.The sound is not great though as it distorts at high volumes. The high range and mid range sounds are pretty good but it totally lacks low range output. Be advised that there is absolutely no bass whatsoever. But all said and done its an OK set for the $10 price.
3,"Good for listening, bad for headphones","They sound good, but there is a considerable amount of hissing noise in my headphones when plugging into the headphone jack that I don't get when plugging the headphones directly into the computer. A little disappointed."
2,"Tinny, Flat and no bass or treble adjustments","I gave up a standard pair of logitechs that were the standard office (vanilla) color to get some black speakers to match my system. What a mistake, the older speakers had bass and trebble control, sounded great compared to these speakers and could fill the area around my desk. These sound like I am listening to an old battery operated AM radio - I should return them. Aweful."
4,Good speakers for the price,"I wanted speakers to listen to background music while I am working. So very low volume. And for this price, I think they are perfect. I don't play any games that might benefit from better speakers, and as far as music goes, I think you'd be hard pressed to have a PC match the quality of your separate stereo system. Good luck."
1,I've learned my lesson!,"I had to replace the speakers that came with my computer and didn't want to spend much money, so I bought these. It's been less than a year and they have stopped working. At first, I thought it was my computer, until I plugged them into another computer and had the same problem. It's as if there is a ""short"" when I first touch the outlet (for lack of better term), then it's dead.I didn't keep the box and I doubt it is worth my time to try to dig for the receipt which, unfortunately, is buried deep in my ""toss it in"" drawer, I'm just going to buy another brand/better product today."
3,Computer Speakers,These speakers are discontinued and they sent the replacement. The ones they sent me work fine but it would have been nice to know ahead of time. They look a little different and they are much smaller.
4,Great speakers,These are really great speakers for my computer. They have great sound and do their job perfectly!!!
2,mobile phone interference,"I dock my iPhone at my computer, about a foot from these speakers. Every couple of minutes, I get the popping ""dut, duh, duh, dut, duh, duh, dut, dut, dut...."" interference noises. A great use of your $15 if you have no wireless equipment, but I plan to get rid of these in favor of something with better shielding."
4,not bad for the price,"I wanted a basic speaker for my laptop and these are doing a decent job. Three annoying things are1- hissing noise when no music is going thru2- music does not great when the at high volumes3- short power cordOverall, not bad for that price!"
2,Disappointed,"When we received the speakers one of them did not work so we were sent another set. the sound quality was really good that is why I gave it at least a 2 star. with in a couple days one of the speakers stopped working but we continued to used them and now it's only been about two weeks and the volume button has become loose and the plug that inserts into the computer is also not working properly, I think there is a problem with the way the wire is attached to the plug thingie.These speakers seem to be cheaply made which suprises me becasue we have other Logitech products and they are very nice."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"If all you want is sound coming from speakers, then look no further. If you expect to enjoy listening to music through these speakers, you will be disappointed. These are very low-end speakers."
3,They fit the bill,"Good speakers just for windows startup sound and click sounds and some sport highlights, but by no means a set to listen to music too. Fits the bill if you're in need for speakers less then $20 just fine."
1,Sucks !! You get what you pay,"I never expected such low quality product from logitech. I was looking for decent pair of speakers for my desktop which btw has very good sound card. I have Creative inspire T3030 which I bought last year for 20 bucks. If I Compare cost vs performance of Creative T3030 to these, R-10 speakers stand nowhere. My 2 cents of advise, Don't buy these speakers."
1,Absolutely unbearable headphone hiss,The hiss when listening through headphones plugged into the front of these speakers is absolutely terrible. Do not purchase if you want to use headphones with these speakers.
2,Not the best if you want temporary,these speakers are OK if your just looking to have temporary sound on your computer but if you want to listen to some music don't even bother because the volume cant go high or else the sound breaks up so in conclusion these speakers are good for just temporary sound on your computer
5,on a high end system the sound IS a serious improvement !,"the sound of Miles trumpet is significantly better here. less ""digitalis"" (overly bright highs) but not at the expense of rolled off highs. this is sonically better then the rvg 2006 remaster of relaxin'.in fact it sounds more like the MOSAIC records vinyl pressings then any 16 bit release so far. it may even surpass them in some ways but I did not do an a/b comparison yet so I couldn't say. But some of what I heard hinted at it: it sounded as if the tapes were fresher here.my search for truely enjoyable cd masterings of this incredible work is finished. Thanks Joe Tarantino for working a wonder!"
2,Packaging issues - not the music!,"I've read mixed reviews about Prestige box set releases and I have to say, the packaging for this set is HORRIBLE. The cover is nice - Miles Davis artwork, but the inside contains unnecessary CARDBOARD holders for the discs, unlike the clear plastic ones Columbia uses. One of the cardboard holders isn't even lined up right. It looks like an elementary school art project. The booklet slides into a cardboard sleeve as does the fourth disc. It's... weird. I just received it today and I don't foresee the set packaging holding up as well as the sleek Columbia sets.However, we don't really have a choice, do we? The music is always a must. : )"
2,not interesting enough,I thought it would be much more exciting but it was not what I thought it would be.
3,Yes/ No May Be :),"Neruda's works never cease to impress but this particular set of poems are far too contextualized (as understandable from the title of course) but some of the poems will still strike a chord with Neruda fans.For me, I have read better from Neruda. Enjoy! :)"
4,Monstrous Fun,"The Monsterican Dream is porrly titled, but the songs are great. The CD also contains the music video for ""Blood Red Sandman,"" which is a wonderful mini horror movie with a fantastic song."
1,dont like it,"The product description is not true, ""quality leather upper""? NO!All man-made materials so they can not breathe. Also, following the previous views, I ordered 1/2 size lager than my normal size and it still did not fit well. They are going to back to the warehouse.This is another pair of Kenneth Cole REACTION which let me down."
4,Runs big but very comfortable,"the height on the shoe is perfect, and the toe isn't too harsh for walking all day. the only thing is that it runs slightly big, so order accordingly."
4,nice shoes!,I bought them a 1/2 size bigger than I would normally wear and they fit well. The pewter is more of a blue/green than I was expecting.
2,Good looking shoes,The shoes look so great but I got a half size larger and the toe room was still cramped. I had to send them back. It is a very good looking shoe and the heel is perfect in height. I hope it works for you!
5,Great HDMI Cable,"I had a 16ft Sondy HDMI cable that I had to buy from Fry's as I had just bought a new TV and didn't have an HDMI cable on hand. It was only 16ft yet it cost 100 bucks and I full well knew there were longer cables for much cheaper online. Anyways as soon as I had a chance I ordered this cable and as soon as I received it I switched the cables out - the HDTV quality was *just* as good as the Sony and there was absolutely ZERO signal degradation even though this cable was more than twice the length of the previous HDMI cable I had. Not to mention the cable is thick and just looks/feels like it's very well built. Lastly, I needed a long cable that also had 1.3a compliance and this cable had that as well.If you need a long HDMI cable you should feel confident that this will do the job just as well as any other overpriced cable you would end up buying anywhere else."
1,Misprint,"Nothing wrong with the cable, but it is 10 feet not 10 meters. The company was great and let me keep the product while giving me a full refund."
5,Excellent Book!,I will recommend every parent and care-giver read this book. It offers a lot of skills and knowledge on nurturing children. Thank you Dr. Sal Severe for making me understand the world surrounding me and my children
5,So Far So Good!,"Haven't quite finished the book yet... However, have applied time-out technique - it works! Thank You, Dr. Severe, for caring about our kids!"
5,Thank you Dr. Severe,"I have just purchased How To Behave So Your Children Will, Too! by Sal Severe, Ph.D. This book has been very useful to me as a school administrator who often has to help parents with childraising skills."
2,Reliability in question,"Received this device last year; it was easy to install and operate (except that the printing on the on/off button was upside-down). It did everything I expected of it for a while.Unfortunately, one year and 14-days after purchase (just after the warranty elapsed, of course), it stopped working. Nothing happens when I push the on/off button. Got power to the plug... just doesn't come on.One very unhappy customer."
3,Older book,"Older book, some things might have changed in modern times, classes and such, but still useful. Was used as a text book for school age children when written but would be high school or early college today."
1,One hit wonders,"I heard one track (""Don't Invent Me"") from this CD on a National Public Radio program and initially thought Mandalay was a great discovery. The music was atmospheric and transforming. The lyrics were unintelligible, perhaps intentionally, but it didn't seem to matter. As with many other recordings, I thought the stirring of one's imagination was more important, how it made you feel . . . probably stunning as part of a film soundtrack.Then I received the CD in the mail. The other 13 tracks turned out to be tedious dreck. Perhaps with the volume turned down, it might work as elevator music, where you'd only hear a few moments at a time. What a waste of money! My CD goes free to the first elevator management company out there."
1,Fire Fox Throat mic,"I bought one of these to use while biking. The PTT button was perfect because I I could attach it to my handle bar and press it without having to move my hand. From the start the mike did't pick up my voice very well. People couldn't hear me talking clearly. Well about 30 miles into my bike ride the cover for the ptt button fell off. Then about 15 miles later the ptt button was going on and off and jamming so the call tone confirmination kept going off. About 5 miles later I dumped the hedset and radio since it had really ""fallen apart"". 3 people I know have bought these and taken them back due to lack of quality. I bought mine at REI and took mine back and they said that they had gotten alot of returns and that they arn't very good hedsets. It is too bad that the set didn't work because it was the perfect set up for me. Hope this review helps you. Don't buy this mic."
1,Stick with a normal boom mic,"I bought a pair of these thinking they would be great for keeping in touch with my hunting partners on our two-ways. I figured we wouldn't have to talk as loud and spook any deer. WRONG! The throat mics do not work as advertised! They only trasmitted garbled noise and you could barely make out what the other person was saying. It was somewhat clearer if you put the mic on the corner of your mouth, but that is uncomfortible and not its intended placement. I returned mine and bought a standard boom style mic."
4,The best of Kurt Weill's songs by Lenya,"You perhaps know the famous ""September song"" or ""Mack the knife"". This CD includes these songs, but other songs from Berlin & Broadway plays by Kurt Weill. Contrary to the SONY ""Digipacks"", you have a booklet with the lyrics in the box : this is very pratical, because Weill's music and the texts cannot be separated. Moreover, you have songs in the German and in the American styles on the same CD, performed by Lenya - The best for Weill -. But this CD is mono and you don't have all the berlin theater songs of the digipack (Silbersee..). Anyway, it's a real good product."
4,Review for Glider Bench,This is a very nice product. It was pretty easy to assemble and it appears very durable. My entire family loves it. I would have liked it if it was a bit longer (fit 3 people) right now it fits me and my husband and my 2 year old. My previous swing fit 3 adults comfortably.
3,not what it looks!,"From the picture, it looks like real quality, for the price. When I opened the box, it was just 2 pieces of plastic. . . but after being built, it is not as uncomfy to sit on as it would seem. It sits on my patio. It rocks smoothly and I am enjoying it, but I don't think it was worth its price."
4,A prelude for things to come?,"First,14YOG are certainly not the best musically(Sounding like a cross between Devo and you banging a keyboard in frustration at a music store).But they make up for it in lyrics.Ok,they arn't John Lennon or Kurt Cobain,but dammit they try!The thing that turns out to be the saving grace is that the songs are generally about Video Games.Video games!For the love of Bog,where on EARTH have you heard songs about Animal Crossing or GTA?!Nowhere fool!Also,as the title implies,there could very well be more bands joining in on this.Think of it,these people could do for Nintendo music what The MIsfits did for Horror-Punk."
1,wow. .,"wow. . . I saw these guys on x-play. And BOY do they *SUCK*!I mean seriously ! I'm open-minded, but these people are comparable to little children banging on pots and pans and calling it music - how DID these people get a record deal?How is this even music?"
1,ehhh...interesting?,"if your high on drugs or had a hangover...this might be a good cd for you, but if your a gamer without any musical talents YOUR AN IDIOT...this is a perfect example of what not to do after playing too too much video games. This is very innovative of them,but its better to hear the music on REAL video games than actual people doing them live...and its true they are 14 year old white girls playing without knowing how to use a keyboard..*cough*pieceofjunk*cough* not worth your money."
1,This is Not an Immortal,"To call this piece of Junk an ""Immortal"" is an insult to the real Persian Immortals.Why the idiotic movie writer chose to honor the actual 300 Spartans with such Comic Book childish crap is beyond me, the scary part beingthat he actually sold tickets to this Fiasco of a Movie.I for one would not praise this TOY even if you gave it to me for it insults actual History and makes our Society even Dumber."
4,moonraker,i ordered this poster because i was meeting Richard Kiel (Jaws) and i had him sign the poster. everything was great!
1,This SUCKS,This fryer is no good at all. The sides are fragile and easily dented. It can't keep the oil temp. up and will unexpectadly turn off and not be able to be turned back on for hours. The basket/handle combo are poorly constructed since the handle must come off to close the lid and it is extremely difficult to remove the handle. DO NOT BUY!
1,poor quality,"The first fyer was dented, so I sent it back. The second fryer would not heat up.I had to send it back. Do not order from this vendor."
1,Huge Disappointment,"After preparing wonderful Arancinos, I powered up the Fryer. It would never get hot enough. It only got lukewarm. Repeated attempts failed. Now I have an oil filled bucket that is good for nothing. Steer clear."
2,Lame ending,I just finished reading this book and I have to say that it had one of the lamest endings I have ever read in a book. The story line was okay...good enough to read but I wouldn't say it was engrossing. Luckily it was a quick read so I don't feel like I wasted too much of my life.
3,No end,"it was a well written book that kept me intrigued, however, as I felt the pages getting fewer and fewer, I started to look for a conclusion. As I turned to the last page, it ended.They live happily ever after only in your dreams or ...."
4,Works pretty well.,I've had these on since my kid could walk at 10 months and they were hard enough for him to remove so he lost interest and now he's two and i just keep them on as added protection. just one more layer for him to get through if he happens to find new interest in the knobs.
1,Great idea..I wish the product had been....,"What a pain! My daughter could open them no problem, luckily because it was so easy she wasn't interested in it. You have to take them off to use the broiler. Like another reviewer said, it's easier just to remove your knobs...don't waste your money."
1,Don't bother!!!!,These covers are a total waste. The clear plastic lids fall right off and are a constant struggle. It is less hassle to just take the knobs right off the stove.
1,DON'T BUY THESE KNOB COVERS!!!,"We thought that these were the same Safety 1st knob covers that we had purchased two years ago. Those were larger, and were very easy to open with one hand, using minimal force. These are much smaller, barely cover our knobs, and are nearly impossible to open with one hand. One of us CANNOT open them without pulling the knob off of the stove, the other needs to stop cooking and concentrate on the proper amount of force to apply in order to open them.Overall, these knob covers are very good at covering knobs, and preventing little fingers from turning them, but they are not very good at letting you use the knob in a manner that will permit cooking.Take a little more time and look for the larger, easier to open Safety 1st knob covers (with a thumb-sized push-pad)."
1,Too Easy to Open,"Nice thought, but my 20 month old has no problem pulling the covers open and exposing the knobs. Safety 1st needs to go back to the drawing board with this item."
5,Good product,"If you have small children or unruly pets that like to run all over the kitchen, it is essential to have that. The covers are simple to install and efficient."
3,OK Thriller from Dan Curtis,"Despite what the information on the cover says, this film was produced and directed by genre vet Dan Curtis. People are being murdered in a California town. Is there a werewolf on the loose, or is there not? The combination of Curtis' no-frills direction and Richard Matheson's script provide the answers in this OK ""Movie of the Week"" telefilm from 1974. Peter Graves and Clint Walker (in an atypical role) are the main stars. It's a good time passer (less than 75 minutes long), nothing more than that.The source print that Brentwood Communications has used is worn in spots, but is serviceable. As is the case with their other budget releases, Brentwood includes a cartoon, an interactive movie trivia game, chapter stops, and a DVD dictionary of terms."
2,"""Tonight on the A.B.C. Tuesday Movie Of The Week!"" Part 3","Wow, did I ever really like this one. Just not up to the memory that I had of this one. Really just a a live action version of ""Scooby Doo"" without the humor. really shows it's age now."
3,Worth sitting through,"This is good television. The running time feels right at 78 minutes, and it wouldn't be able to handle a dragged out running time. It's great for any attention span, and the story unfolds at a good pace. The dialogue is very much of the 70's television variety, where some times I ask my self, ""do people really talk like this?"" And the disco score is cheesy, with very familiar, cheesy sounds. All of the killings are off camera, which I found to be a detractor, the photography is fairly boring, the colors are flat, and some things are un-focused. On the whodunnit side of things, I was hooked, and fooled when I thought I knew who did it. If you like watching movies as it's getting late and you're tired, this won't drag along too badly, you can probably sit through this one without feeling like you have to go to sleep."
4,Clint Walker is chilling in this film,"I have always loved werewolves, but this one has a twist. Won't give the movie away, but Clint Walker spent 20 years playing goody two shoes roles in Hollywood, like WB's and ABC's ""Cheyenne"" and he did a lot of great films where he wasn't quite the good guy, ""Fort Dobbs"" sticks out. But overall, he played a Saint. This movie he doesn't. He's a bit older in it and so is Peter Graves. But the movie is well worth seeing. I loved every chilling moment of it, with the shocking ending. I suggest you buy it if you are a fan of Walker's, Graves' or Werewolf genre."
5,Probably one of the Best Best Of Compilations that there ever was!,"If you are looking for the best retrospective of The Clash out there, this is it!Not only are all the tracks remastered but they are arranged in a very cohesive track order to make the whole double cd album sound very smooth as it goes along and not disjointed like many other compilations that just go with chronology.If you want chronology, just arrange your track selection/shuffle function on your cd player and stop complaining already. Obviously a lot of thought has gone into this track selection and I, for one, think it's a good one.Get this and ""London Calling"" and you basically have all the best these guys have done. A very important band in the history of rock music so can you afford not to have this in your collection?"
5,"Oh, the wonderful Clash","If anyone wants to start listening to the Clash, this is the album to get. I started listening to them when I had heard their Jamaican-style ska tunes, but then my eyes were opened up to their harder punk tunes. That is where they really shine. Their lyrics, unlike so many bubble-gum punk bands of today, are actually somewhat intelligent and real. Aspiring punk and ska bands should definitely take note of this band and this album if they ever want any success. ROCK THE CASBAH!!!"
1,DONT BUY THIS,"This set is a big waste of mney because it misses too many important tracks from the Clash... It has a strange mix of tracks. Although it has some good songs, you will wind up just wanting to buy all the records themselves. Go for London Calling or the debut album or give em enough rope."
4,The Clash is the best band ever,"Great CD, great tracks, some missing, but good overall. The Clash is the defining band of the 80s and this disc proves it. If you like the Clash, I suggest checking out the Dead Milkmen, Butthole Surfers, and Dead Kennedys, ROCK ON!"
2,"No, I say!","How can a Clash best-of leave out songs like The Call Up, Rudie Can't Fail, Hateful, and 48 Hours? And why are the tracks placed in a seemingly random order? What's here is great, obviously, but there are so many giant gaps that I don't think it's worth it; better to go with the original albums."
3,Not as I was expecting,"I read lots of articles and white papers on Smart Cards for the last three years specially in banking sector.I don't conceder my self as an expert in this field, this which enthuse me to start digging more and search for other approaches to increase my knowledge.I took this book; I read it page by page from the cover to the cover. Unfortunately I couldn't find more information than what I had before.So my suggestion if you're already familiar with smart cards concept, practices, few information about encryption, I prefer to search for other book.If you're new on this field and if you don't want to spend lots of time searching for good articles and white paper and your budget can stand for the book price, I recommend you to go for it."

2,Lost Opportunity,"This book sounded so fascinating that I made two shopping trips to find it in time for a long transatlantic flight. The premise--forgotten descendants of lost empires still clinging to shreds of their heritage in distant and remote lands--was enough to make any adventurous reader salivate. But the payoff was disappointing. Mr. Orizio's characters are two-dimensional and his style rambling. We learn very little about these real people; not enough to learn to care about them very much. This ought to be riveting stuff, but the literary equivalents of archeological relics glitter only rarely. Despite solid historical information, all of it news to me, I came away feeling I'd been on a tour bus that never stopped long enough to see much."
3,meandering,"The author provides an overview of six little known groups, all either partially or entirely descended from Europeans but now marginalised minorities far from Europe and in danger of dying off or being assimilated up by the surrounding societies. An approximately equal weight is given to each:- Dutch Burghers of Ceylon- Germans in Jamaica- Confederates (from the US South) in Brazil- Poles in Haiti (descendants of Polish soldiers and African wives)- Basters in Namibia- Blancs Matignon in GuadeloupeThe book is part travel log, part history, part anthropology. It's pleasant enough and easy to read but I found it disorganised, meandering and at times a bit vacuous."
3,"Great subject matter, so-so writing","I cannot think of many subjects more intriguing than hidden pockets of living history in remote corners of the world. The whole concept that descendants of colonnial powers still live in isolated pockets of their former colonies has a surreal feel to it, which makes it an incredibly compelling topic.Although one must commend Orizio for his curiosity and dilligence, his writing is sometimes confusing. In some passages, Orizio's ""stream-of-consciousness"" writing manages to turn an enthralling subject into a bewildering hodge-podge of history, sociology, and first-person accounts.Having said this, I truly believe that Orizio's effort to put out a book like no other is evidenced by the obvious large amount of research. However, I would have to say that this is a very interesting book that failed to live up to its potential."
3,More like a travel magazine,"This book was shorter than I expected. Its a good book for beginner's, but it is as much an account of Mr. Orizio's travels as it is a scholarly work. Good book, needs an in-depth follow up"
1,Response to Conn. Reader,What did you expect from something listed on CNN? CNN is the most propagandized medium for misinformation in the world.
2,Plasic head pulls off metal pin,These are great pins except the plastic heads pull off easily. If they would have fixed the two parts together better they would be perfect. The manufacturer cut corners on this product. There are German grip pins available (HLMO0002) that don't pull apart. I would recommend these.
3,Bone Harvest,"There were so many characters involved with this book I forgot who was who, and who to think was commiting the crime. Took the fun out of it. The only reason I read it in the first place was because it's based in my home state of Wisconsin, and a little over an hours away."
3,Pretty Good Mystery,"This book is one of three mysteries I picked up for vacation reading. It follows classic mystery conventions to a fault, becoming fairly predictable. Both of the other books I chose, Excursion to Tindari and, especially, Summer of the Big Bachi, are far superior. But, if you want a fairly good quick read that won't upset your lazy afternoons at the beach, this one will work.The writing seems forced and is especially weak when it wanders off into the protagonist's boring personal life (yes, of course her kid is cute and precocious). Without even reading the dust jacket, the writing style, stock characters, and narrative emphasis clue you in that the author is an upstanding country lady right out of Lake Woebegone. I'm sure she grows organic vegetables when not writing poetry. Maybe the writing would be more interesting if she spent some time in a grittier locale."
2,okay,"I bought a medium, and it's a bit too big and the arms too long, and the coat itself is not all that warm. Probably best not to use in very cold weather. The exterior gets 'linty' very easily so I wouldn't recommend this coat if you have pet fur or dust issues!When I sit in my car, the neck of the coat rides up past my ears, which I find pretty annoying and when I put my hands in the pockets to find something, I have to almost pull the bottom of the coat up to reach in because the pockets are so low (but I am short, 5 foot 3).It is comfortable otherwise, and I'm beginning to get used to the loose fit. This is a great coat for someone very busty like me, but taller and it definitely won't be too tight across the chest.All in all, not the best coat for me, but okay for the price of 40 bucks."
3,hmmmmm,Didn't work for me but may work for others. Did not successfully adapt the device as intended. Fits the junk box of new and used useless electronic castoffs just fine however.
1,Does not work. Not in Xp. Not in Win7,I should of read the reviews... I really should of. Everyone else has been chanting it does not work. They were right.
1,"Will only work with Precision Pro model ""85791"" and only after you short pins 2 and 7.","BE WARNED . . . .This will only work with Precision Pro if the Product ID starts with ""85791"".And only if you can find a way to short pins 2 and 7 together to enable it.Older Precision Pro models will need a completely different way to become USB capable. And did not include an adapter at all. They have no internal USB circuits.This is only a standard adapter and the jumper fix is only for the ""85791"" Precision Pro. It will not work as a replacement unless you can do some work on it.Also if you mod this adapter it could cause damage to other gaming controllers or hardware that use those pins.What a poorly named product . . . .Should come with some instructions about this mod, or perhaps a small wire jumper that could be easily inserted."
2,It doesn't work.,I bought this adapter hoping it would allow use of either the Sidewinder Pro or the Sidewinder Pro 3D joysticks on a Windows 7 computer. No joy with either joystick.
1,bogus,"Although the adapter fits the sidewinder joystick - it is a waste of money....The Joystick will NOT work with this usb configuration!No drivers available- and if you search, you will see that no one elsehas been able to get it to work with the adapter either!Good idea- miserable failure!I ended up having to buy a new joystick- Saitek from now on!"
1,Simply not working,"How comes that an adapter called ""USB Joystick Adapter 8 Db15f/usb for Ms Sidewinder"" simply does not work ? Sidewinder joystick is not detected by Windows XP once connected to this adapter, apparently no drivers avail, no way to force a manual install. No info on Belkin site. Really frustrating."
2,Not for all sidewinders,"I bought this because it said it was for the MS Sidewinder. Apparently it's only for a very specific Sidewinder, and not the one I have. Thus, it is useless. There are no drivers available. Either it works or it doesn't. For me, it didn't."
1,Whoopsie,"I wish the review posted Aug 27 had been up when I bought this. I have a Performance PC Commander Plus that I bought in a dollar store and guess what, this adapter doesn't work for it. I had a hard time getting the joystick to work on my old computer and assumed the bad reviews were because of similar problems finding the right controller settings. So, if you don't have a MS Sidewinder, don't buy this. Oh, well. If somebody does know a model of adapter that WILL work for other joysticks, then how about posting it here?"
1,This is a RIP OFF,I echo the other reviews. MS Windows XP won't reconized my Sidewinder Pro using the adaptor. Belkin and MS have no support. Save your money and just buy a new USB joy stick.
1,Non-Functional with Non-Existent Drivers,"Bought this item and attempted to use it. It appears that WIN XP won't recognize it and there doesn't appear to be any drivers of any sort for it.Belkin does not have the product listed on their website any longer and does not even appear under the ""discontinued"" listings."
1,An adapter or a swindle,"I already bought this item and plugged it into the USB port with my MS 3D Pro Sidewinder Joystick, and it doesn't work in any way. Also, I tested the USB ports with my digital camera and all of them work good! I tried to get some technical support from manufacturer and I am still waiting... Then you may judge yourself."
1,Worthless,"DO NOT BUY. It did not work with my Microsoft SideWinder Precision Pro. It was never recognized by Windows XP. Even though I tried every suggestion by other users, it proved useless."
1,not work,"I bought this item because my new PC dint have a DB25 game port, if you are running windows XP it will not recongcide the divice, so it will be worthless."
2,Useless,"It does the conversion but no software to make it work for my joystick. Waste of money, just go buy an up to date peripheral (joystick/gamepad)"
1,It did not work.,"It did not work as advertised. Although it fit my joystick, it was incompatible, and the computer did not recognize that there was anything plugged in."
1,Belkin F3U200-08inch DB15 USB joystick Adapter for Sidewinder,"This product sucks. Its advertised as being specificaly for the SideWinder Precision Pro, but I'm afraid that I must report that its not even up for that. The only thing it will do is cause the presentation of a window that tells you ""Unidentified Hardware Found"" and every attempt that I've made to introduce the computer sytem much less a game to the Sidewinder Precision Pro thru this device has meet with failure."
1,Useless,"Yep I too can confirm that this is indeed useless and doesn't work, THANK U MICROSUX!!! From now on I'll NEVER by any product by microsux's that somebody eles offers.... Like Locgitec fligt stick etc. etc.... Oh yea and a special thank you to bilken for making this pretty much USELESS product and AMAZON for selling it too..."
1,Doesn't work with my Sidewinder Pro,"I ordered it all the way from Nicaragua, paid custom taxes for it, and the thing doesn't work."
1,"Look's nice, but doesn't work","I bought it with hope I should use old joystick my friend borow me, but it was waisting money"
3,Works OK,"This adapter did not work with all of the different Joysticks that I tried. It worked on some, but again not all."
1,THIS IS A GIMMICK OF BELKIN,"If you try to use a Microsoft Force Feedback joystick then forget about this simple cable with 2 connectors.I called Belkin and they assured me I will not have problem with my Microsoft Force Feedback. As usual today, they lied.I ordered from XP PASSPORT for about 3 dollars plus more than 8 dollars shipping and handling (one man or woman handling from the shelf to the envelope).Now checking their return policy they refund the merchandise but not the shipping costs. As you reckon I am not going to pay a shipping to get 3 dollars back, even I doubt they give the money back.XP PASSPORT took a super long time to ship.So Belkin and XP PASSPORT belong to the same society. Shame on Belkin and shame on XP PASSPORT.I think Amazon should check close this guys."
1,Don't buy this product,"It claims to work for the MS Sidewinder, but when I tried to use it, my computer sees it as an ""unrecognized USB device."" Spend your money elsewhere, and don't waste it on this useless product. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
2,Does Not Work With CH Products Virtual Pilot Pro!,"This product probably works fine with a sidewinder joystick. However, it does not work at all with the CH Products Virtual Pilot Pro yoke and pedals which is why I bought it. There is also no support or documentation for the product."
1,USB Joystick Adapter for Sidewinder,"The product came to me in perfect condition and very fast. I was just disappointed that the product didn't allow me to use my old Sidewinder Gamepad. It was probably a huge problem with software and installing drivers for a gameport and routing it to the USB hub of my PC, so the product may not necessarily be the problem. Not being very expensive, I don't feel like I lost a lot on purchasing the item. Things just didn't work out. But again, fast delivery and the product arrived in perfect condition and as described."
3,Adapter for Sidewinder Precision Pro ONLY,"The adapter does not jumper pin 2 to pin 7 to allow recognition on Windows as a digital device. To do that remove the bottom of the sidewinder joystick. There will be screws under the pads on the bottom. Pry pads off with a sharp knife. Be careful!To remove the PC board to get to the wires, remove the two SMALL screws near the chip and a larger screw off to the opposite side. DO NOT remove the 4 screws arranged in a square. That will have the joystick parts everywhere!Once you can get to the cord wires, use a soldering iron to melt the insulation off of the dark blue and purple wires above the connector. They are next to each other so solder the two together. Then plug the joystick into the adapter and the USB into the PC. My XP recognized it then."
1,Did not work,Belkin F3U200-08INCH DB15 8-Inch USB Joystick Adapter for SideWinder. This thing didnt even show up on any of my usb ports at all. With or with out the SideWinder attached before pluging in. Wish it did I dont want to toss out my Good ol SideWinder controller it rocked. So much for a good idea that just didnt work.
2,Euh...,"I don't know what to say about this book. Practice reading music before buying?My personal exp goes like this: I cannot read music sheets like a pro, I'm completely juvenile, and it just didn't work for me, this book. IT IS COMPLETELY MY FAULT that it didn't work too. I never committed to it and honestly, the only thing I can complain about with this book was that it was just not engaging, I was never drawn in. I got bored.I'm no Mozart or have any intention on being that good, so if you're like me, you'd further explore. I've yet to try any others, always open for suggestions too."
5,"Hanon hurts, but in a good way!","Hanon is a great tool to pianists of all levels. The only limit is your discipline to practice it. 15-30 minutes a day minimum will yield excellent results that you will notice quickly. I also recommend it as a warm up before you begin to practice actual music. If you think there is a ceiling to your ability, I guarantee you, you don't know what it is. Practicing these exercises will enable you to play better over time than you imagined. Practice practice practice!"
3,For the experienced pianist ONLY,"I bought this book along with a few others. I was hoping that it would teach me practice exercises for playing. Unfortunately, it doesn't. What other reviewers here as well as Amazon.com fails to tell you is that this book is strictly for the experienced student. You should NOT get this book unless you have a strong knowledge of music reading. This is not for beginners. Don't waste your money.However, if you're experienced and looking for a book to limber up your fingers, well, then this might help you."
1,Do not wast your time,There is no piano technique is this book. I wasted tree years on this. There is no musical purpose on the exercices. Piano technique combines body movement with musical expression.
5,Hanon: The Virtuoso Pianist in Sixty Exercises for the Piano for the...,"This was the closest I could get to Hanon for the Accordion. Highly recommend it! Can't do any serious playing without the dexterity these exercises provide.If you are an accordion player, you will have to make some minor modification to allow for the different range of the keyboard, but it is wll worth the effort!"
2,Use with moderation,"This book is a must-own for pianists, whether you hate it or love it. As a serious pianist, I practiced Hanon for about an hour a day hoping to strengthen my technique. During this time I noticed an increase in independency and dexterity, as promised. However, after learning the entire volume, I found it very inefficient to practice the entire book through. I recommed that pianists only use the first section for musclar relaxation and practice only the later examples daily. One may also find that at a point it is more rewarding, technically and musically, to study Chopin, Liszt, or other etudes instead."
4,Love/Hate Relationship,"There are times when I want to light this book on fire and throw it (and the metronome) out the window.But it works. I like how the exercises gradually get harder, instead of taking big jumps.Even my typing's improved."
5,Great satire... I hope!,"This book is so researched around zombie movies, it makes the perfect gift for any fan of the living dead! However, if one day you wake up surrounded by the walking dead, possibly in a farmhouse, you may want this book at your side. So, lesson here? If you only buy one copy... best keep it for yourself."
5,Absolutely Fantasic,"I've always been a big zombie fan, this just opened my eyes more and I ended up loving it, every single word. I didn't purchase it from Amazon but bought it in a bookstore and am reviewing it on here. A must have, amazing book."
4,Inspiring fun with an undead twist,"I bought this book because my 14 year old son wanted it but ended up reading it myself (he also likes it a lot, by the way).I always wondered why these people on the run from Zombies decide to hole up in a shopping mall with these big and unsafe entrances. Is this really a good idea?And why must they always board up the windows in such a way that even a weakened zombie break through? Could I have done better?And when you have found a safe hide-out in the country and have cleared the surroundings from Zombies, how can you make sure you can go swimming in the lake, when Zombies can hide out at the bottom of the lake unseen?This book answered pretty much all of my technical questions regarding Zombies and a lot more I have never thought about - for instance how the old Romans could deal with Zombie-outbreaks so effectively...I can whole-heartedly recommend this book to everyone who has ever chuckled in a George Romero movie."
3,NOT AS GOOD,"I much preferred World War Z over the Zombie book. It's much better written, requires less of the reader and makes its points far more succinctly.First of all, to enjoy this book you have to buy into the concept of a zombie invasion and that this is a mock csurvival guide in event of such an invasion. Uh...I don't think so. Then, you have to sign off on page after page of needless filler and bits and pieces of endless repetition, all supposedly to prepare for this invasion...enough already!It's hard for me to believe that the same author wrote both books.World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War"
5,run run,"this is so great. finaly there is a guide for those who are not capable of staying alive.this was a great book, even for personal gain."
5,Very amusing and wait til you tell your friends what you are reading.....,Nicely done book letting you know all you wanted to ever know about zombies....very amusing!
4,Fun read,"Purchased this as ""airplane"" reading.Started reading it at the airport and almost missed the call for my flight.Slightly more practical than ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance."""
5,Be prepared or learn to love brain food,"Do I expect to survive a zombie attack? Heck, no. I can't outrun a turtle. Instead, I plan to join my zombie brethren and share this reference book so that we can develop countermeasures to protect ourselves from the inevitable assaults by the living. However, until that time, I'll be content to enjoy the humor of Max Brooks. Excellent book; excellent reference material for future use -- a must-buy for all zombie wannabes and their victims."
2,"Common sense, but presented with style.","I was given this book as a gift by a friend who knew my love of the zombie genre in film and writing. The book is well written and funny, as I should expect considering the author's father, but being a 'zombie nerd' I found it....uninformative? My fascination with the subject has led me to most of the conclusions he has come to. In fact, I think my 'Zombie Apocalypse' plan is superior! Funny book, but you would have come to the same conclusions were you to live for the first few days of the coming of the zombie hordes! Or better ones!"
5,Awsome,"Its the zombie survival guide how can you afford not own it and read it. It's a quick read with invaluable information. Think surviving is just puting a bullet in a zombies head, think again. Max Brooks provides tangible survival tactics for both short term and long term scenarios. Regardless of the likely hood of a zombie apocolypse you will be prepared."
4,Bit too technical,"Fun read, but I was a bit turned off by the authors discussion of the 'virus' that causes zombies to be zombies. The actual survival portion was good but the best part, in my opinion, was the section on real life zombie encounters throughout history."
1,The best use for this book is. . .,"Place this book in a zip-loc type bag along with a generous supply of wind and water proof matches and seal it, then place the sealed bag in another bag of the same type and seal it; double bagging ensures the book will remain dry even in the most severe conditions. Now put the bagged book in your ""Go Bag"" of emergency supplies or with your camping gear. Used sparingly, the pages of this book should provide fuel for starting dozens of fires for cooking or warmth."
2,Kind of a waste of money....,"I must say, I felt kind of ripped off after buying this book. Thought it would be a bit more satirical, but it was very repetitive. Seeing as It was more ""informative"" I would have expected little things like no contradictions in the text (Fire example: Build A fire to scare away the zombies; earlier- zombies do not notice fire.) I dunno... Good conversational piece?"
1,ZGirl,This book is mean to all zombies. I have two zombies living with me right now. They are totally harmless. They told me that zombies are not flesh eaters but animal eaters. They eat mainly deer and rabbits. The whole human eating thing was a rumor spread by vampires. This book is good if you believe that zombies feel the need to hurt people.
2,"A little too serious, if you ask me","When I got this book, I was expecting something a bit more funny. The premise is funny, a book on how to survive the coming zombie apocalypse, but the book seems a bit too serious.I did like the historical outbreaks section. Each one of those could have been made into a pretty creepy short story."
1,Not what I was hoping for,"I found the pace of this book to be pretty bad. The information given might as well have been in bullet points. The little fictional background given is mildly entertaining at best, and dreadfully boring most of the time.Much of the ""advice"" is either irrelevant to any zombie fan, not amusing, or just plain silly.I was really hoping to enjoy at least one chapter of this ""guide"", but unfortunately I did not. Just finishing it, and it is not a long book by any means, was a challenge.If you were thinking about picking this up, pick up 'Zombie Haiku' instead, it is not only funny, witty, aesthetically pleasing, and creative, but much more worth your time."
2,okay,I bought this after reading world war Z which is the sequel to this book . It is not even close to being as good . I would recommend world war Z highly but not this one .
2,Book content,"The seller/item itself are great. The book itself is boring, highly contradictory and all together not deserving of reviews and media attention I've seen it receive. Sorry Max, you fail; first to die in a Zombie Outbreak for sure."
5,"Fun, with good advice to boot!","The Zombie Survival Guide is a great piece of satire. It's written as a straight survival guide, complete with campy pen and ink drawings illustrating such vital points as keeping your hair cut short and the importance of physical fitness.What surprised me was how *good* the advice was! If there were a zombie invasion, you could actually use this thing. Let me put my review in context. I live on a semi-remote parcel in South-Central Alaska. I'm off grid, and I've learned about survival the hard way. Much of the advice from Brooks rings true to my experience (though I have not encountered the undead yet). Brooks even knows a thing or two about firearms, which isn't what I would expect from such a dazzling urbanite. He also offers sound advice regarding the need for clean water, food, and good off-road transportation.Anyway, thanks to Brooks, I'm ready! Bring on the hordes of undead!"
3,More serious than humorous,"Got this as a gift for someone who wanted it. Upon receiving it, they said they were surprised to find out that the humor in it is entirely tied to just how serious it takes itself. We were expecting a survival guide that was funny in its content, rather than funny in its sincerity."
3,Zombies are they a threat.?,"People laugh when you mention zombies,but Vodoo has been around for centuries and the way man plays with DNA and chemicals who really knows what can be developed. The terminator we're not there yet but we are getting there. So i say it i would rather be prepared than not. the book does give information om weapons and diffrent types of transportation places to hide out or build survival camps with plus and minuses for each that could be applied in diffrent circumstances. The book is supposed to be fiction which is like kidding right. Don't they say there is always truth in kidding. Like it fun to read who knows you may just pick up some info that may help you get out of a bad situation .. I've also read a couple of his other stuff good 3 stars"
5,I'm ready.,"I am fully prepared to take on the infestation. I've rounded up all my friends and family members (however my friends were the only ones that actually paid attention) and we have a detailed plan of how to survive. We can't last longer than 4 months on this plan, but it's the best one we can make in a town like ours.I've read this book 6 times already, and it's a great read for even those who aren't serious about it. I highly recommend it."
2,don't waste your time,"I LOVE World War Z. I just wanted to start with that, it is truely an awesome zombie book. I am also a huge fan of this genre in general. That all said, this book is boring. I think Brooks took a basic survival guide removed ""communists"",""rioters"", ""Lions"", ""Tigers"", and ""Bears"" and inserted ""Zombies""."
3,IT's OKAY!!!!,If you like a good read this is O.K. ---- Was not as good as I had hoped and not as great as promoted to me...
4,Good gift,Can't make any review of this since it is a gift and I did not read itI hate the fact that this makes me write more than what is necessary
5,Fantastic,"There really isn't anything I can say that hasn't already been said. This book is great. It covers lots of topics, like how to choose a new home, weapons... and explains the strengths and weaknesses of each option. The way everything is presented, like this really could happen, kept the book from seeming like some kind of fairy tale. I love it."
4,Funny,I've always thought this book was funny when I saw it in stores. Finally bought it as a gift. It's perfect.
3,Good not great,I read this AFTER world war z and was expecting more of a straight forward book but it reads like a text book.
4,Fun and easy read,"I'm not a big zombie fan. Sure, I've seen all the major movies, but it isn't like I own all the DVD's or anxiously await the next Romero flick. I picked this up on a whim-started skimming through it and thought it was pretty funny. It is pretty much what it says it is-It is an exhaustive survial guide for the next zombie attack. He gives numberous scenarios for what to do when a zombie attacks you, or when you attack a zombie, or just general rules of thumb while you wait for that doomsday attack. At the end of the book he gives a large list of authentic zombie attacks throughout history. Some of them are connected, and, at times, I was a bit creeped out by them. If you're a zombie fan and you haven't picked up this book, by all means grab it-you'll get a kick out of it. I think even people who aren't that intersted in zombies will like this."
1,Hateful portrayal for the living impaired,"As a member of the living impaired community, I found this book perpetuated many hateful sterotypes of the recently deceased. First of all, we are not brainless. Indeed, I had fully three brains this morning for breakfast. Second, the overall tone of the book: brutual intolerance. The living impaired merely enjoy an alternative lifestyle in which we feed upon the organs of hated tropes within the social behaviors of teen movie culture. Don't de-capitate me. If you've got a beef, let's sit down in the same room and you can really give me a piece of your mind. Your yummy delicious blood-filled mind. BRAINS!!!"
3,because you never know...,"because you never know when the zombie apocalypse is going to strike, better to be prepared :) it's a fun read, I ended up skimming after the first 100 pages or so."
3,Book is fine material wasn't,"Cover arrived with a rip in it. The books text is fine, it will throw some stupid story lines at you of what creates zombies which you should ignore, but it will give some good pointers on things you should do."
5,If only it happened,Great book fun to read and great to have on hand it's more of a conversation piece but I would recommend to anyone who wants a good laugh and if you like zombies lol.
2,Nothing like World War Z,"I bought this book because I loved World War Z, but it is horrible in comparison. It's hard to take something so seriously about an event that by all sane thinking can't happen."
3,This is a brain scratcher.,After struggling to get through this I realized that it is great for what it was suppose to be. A guide. It was written like a text book and reads like a text book so job well done right? If that was the goal then yes but ask yourself this...who reads a text book? It was really long to get through.
3,Survive Anything,"I was introduced to the zombie genre through the awesome t.v. show, The Walking Dead. From there, I learned about Max Brooks' books. I really enjoyed World War Z and had pretty high expectations for The Zombie Survival Guide. This book is good, but not as entertaining as World War Z. It lives up to its title as a survival guide, which shouldn't have been as much as a surprise. Oh well. This book could be used for any natural disaster in terms of preparedness. So, even though the book is about surviving zombies, it can be surprisingly helpful."
5,great book,gave as a gift to two different people and they were both very excited about getting it. they both told me they loved reading it.
4,Intriguing.,"Pretty good book on all things zombie related. To the uninitiated,it may seem farsical,but both FEMA and the CDC acknowledge zombies are indeed a real threat.The historical accounts of zombie phenomena are particularly interesting."
4,"Funny yet dark, some parts boring but overall pretty good.","I'm near the end of this book. Overall I liked it. Not in my Top 5 but a good read if you like Zombies and/or Max Brooks. Some parts are very funny, but most of the book reads like an actual military manual, which is funny when the Zombie element is added. Sort of like if you were watching a cooking show on TV showing you how to cook roadkill but taking it totally seriously, it would still be strange and humorous. Also a lot of this book is standard survival guide stuff, which could actually come in handy if there was a nasty solar storm that caused a long power outage, or a big flood that wiped out a lot of local resources and you had to face starvation and bandits until FEMA finally came through."
4,bbrraaaiinnnss...,this book occupied me for awhile. it is hilarious. anyone who likes zombie movies needs it.
3,"A great toilet bowl reader, It'll scare the s**t outta you!","Actually this is not really much of a scary book, and as others have said, and even the book says, is more humor based. It is a fun little read, with some great tongue-in-cheek passages. It starts out very strong, but lags in the middle. The end has some great stuff though.I think somebody else mentioned it best as the type of book to thumb through here and there when you have time to kill. For zombie enthusiasts this is easily a 4 or even 5 star book, for everyone else, it is certainly worth a look or two, and is very original in its style. Check it out, I think most of you will be pleasantly surprised."
2,The most humorous part of the book is the back cover.,"At some point, a one-note parody becomes the very thing an author is attempting to skewer. I'm certain Max Brooks intended this to be a tongue-in-cheek parody of Y2K and 1980s-era survival manuals, but I challenge the reader to draw the distinction between Brooks' work and those oh-so-very-serious guides for surviving catastrophe. In contrast, see the Robin Williams/Walther Matthau/Michael Leeson movie ""The Survivors"". Perhaps Brooks' vision would be better realized on film as well.Unfortunately, this book fails as either humor or horror. On the positive side, I now have a fairly definitive, although sometimes contradictory, zombie outbreak survival manual in my library in case one is needed."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I am huge fan of zombies in general. This book started out to be dryly humorous. I kept waiting for it to become hilarious. It did not. The dry humor continued throughout. I ended up skimming through the last 1/3 of the book to see if there was something I was missing. I assure you there was nothing to be missed. I had high hopes, but this book sadly did not fill the hole in my zombie heart!"
4,An homage to the Zombie concept that goes all the way...,"I'm guessing that Mr. Brooks initially sketched out the idea for this book as a humorous play on the ""Worst-Case Scenario"" guides. It's clear that the author has so much reverence for the subject matter that his attempt at parody upgraded to a respectful homage at some point along the way. The result is a terrific tome for Zombie fiction fans who wonder about the ""real world"" mechanics of responding to a Zombie incident. I enjoyed it."
5,I have found this book to be of much use.,"This book saved me thousands of dollars, my life, and the life of my family!This is a serous problem and the secound outbreak in 10 years! if it happens again I am serously considering putting walls all around like Mr Brooks recomends.My ranch was the sight a CLASS 1 outbreak. A local safari guide had been stupidly keeping penned zombies. Some of his zombies escaped, and consumed/killed my livestock! When hearing of this, we radioed to all the local plantations from our mobile headquarters (a converted truck)Within days, the zombies were killed and burned. If it were not for this book,and others like it, we would have been completely unprepared.We are patiently awaiting that someday Max Brooks will come and visit us, it's easier to get here now that we have our own landing strip! We have much experience we wish to share. He had better practice his rifles though, so we can take him on safari to hunt the zombies that stalk our properties."
3,Fun October Reading,"You can see it in fine print on the back, next to the price. ""Humor""This book doesn't really produce the kinds of laughs most of look for in books one might find in the Humor section. It moves the reader instead to a king of amused admiration for the thoroughness of the parody. Brooks does a good job of maintaining a consistently serious voice. At first, I wasn't sure if it was parody or the writing of someone with, you know, issues. His matter-of-fact cataloging of past Zombie ""incidents"" had me checking a few via google.com to see if he had based these on actual historical events! The humor here is subtle and wry and not everyone will get it. As some other review mentioned, it would be hard to beat this book as a Halloween gift. I also thought of it as gift for a couple of friends of mine who are a bit too prone to take seriously conspiracy theories and paranormal silliness."
5,You laugh now . . . .,"But will you be laughing when there's your undead neighbor chewing on your brain? I didn't think so. Get this book. Read it. Memorize it. Prepare. You never know when there could be some sort of ""virus"" outbreak. I'd rather be prepared then be the one's without a plan."
5,Good Read,"I am not even a reader (at all), but once I picked this book up I couldn't set it down. I read more than half of it in one night, very informative as well, the information doesn't just apply to Zombie survival, but survival in general as well, which could be detrimental to you. The actual physical quality of the book itself is pretty legitimate as well."
3,Entertaining,Good book but not as good as WWZ. If you are a zombie fan you will be entertained. The bits about different zombie timeline encounters was fun but almost too redundant in some cases. Great precursor to WWZ though and you will like it if you are a zombie fan.
4,Great Book,"Max Brooks writes so well and extensively about the fictional ""living dead"" that one might believe they are a very real and dangerous threat.I recommend reading this, as well as his more recent novel: World War Z - which I was a third of the way through when I had to put it down because I was told about this book and the fact that it gives a more complete description of his Zombie creatures. I ended up finishing both books, and am very glad I did."
3,Codified and zombiefied.,"I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, it's a fascinating and complete primer on how one should behave in a Romeroesque zombie outbreak or apocalypse. On the other, it helps to codify the version of zombies that has already become so common that some people don't realize they don't HAVE to be bite-contagious, cannibalist and headshot-vulnerable."
4,"Brilliant, if you're a diehard fan","I genuinely loved this book, but really can only recommend it to die-hard zombie fans. Brooks' other book on the subject,World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, I would recommend to any reader.This book is a guide to surviving the zombie apocalypse, and there is even a chapter dedicated to fighting back when the time comes.It covers such vital topics as choosing weapons, the essential supplies you'll need, how to choose vehicles and how to fortify your home.It's a little slow and certainly not as compelling as World War Z. Some of the book comes across as repetitive, as the chapter on choosing a fortress and the chapter on fighting back will both discuss the terrains you may encounter, for example.I think the fact that I have so little to say about this book kinda speaks for itself. I still haven't shut up about how awesome World War Z was. Perhaps if I had read this book first (and it was written first) I would have enjoyed it more."
4,Zombie survial gude,"Fun and great reading for sitting around in waiting rooms, while having a conversation with spouse or if your gonna be in the john a while. Shipping was free but the packaging was poor. Recived a lil beat up. Suck cause they were gifts. Overall great book for the paranoid and curious reader!!"
4,Good summer beach reading for a guy,"The rating is 4 instead of 5 only because it is meant to be silly comedy.The book was meant to be humoristic, male, recreational reading. Age range appropriate for males from 14 to 50.I have great sensibilities, am well educated, and have a well-developed sense of homor.I loved the book, thought it was very complete, too long, and enjoyable from beginning to end. One can read part, put it down and come back 3 months to a year later then pick it back up and continue. (I did that because I misplaced it.)It is good late winter reading, beach reading, nothing on TV reading, can't sleep at night, and/or mental break reading.The author (Max Brooks) is Mel Brookss son and family humor transends the generations."
5,Essential Reading Material,A great book about how to survive the impending zombie apocalypse. Don't buy this book expecting it to be making a ton of jokes or read like a novel. It's funniest when flipped through from time to time to see what the author has to say on various topics regarding avoiding the undead masses.
3,Tries too hard,"This books was ... well ... ok. It is a good idea, but it tries too hard to sound like a real survival guide. In so doing, it drags on and on and gets really boring. I love a good zombie spoof, and I enjoyed this book for about 10 minutes.I also found myself getting frustrated with this book in a nerdy kind of way. There are so many plot flaws in this and contradictions that I found myself arguing with the book. It's a zombie spoof. I should be able to just enjoy it, but it tries too hard to sound legitimate that I have to argue with it.Zen of Zombie is a much better spoof. A lot more fun to read, and ironically since it is so tongue in cheek, a lot more accurate in its homage to the zombie genre.While this book was ok, I wouldn't recommend spending your money or time on it."
1,The product descriptions in an REI catalog are more entertaining than this book,"I bought this book based on the reader reviews, however this book fell short of even my lowest expectations. Most of the book is filled with dry content like ""Chainsaw- A heavy weapon effective at cutting through attacking zombies, but limited by it's range and weight."" Following this would be an entry of another item with the same sort of superficial description. The illustrations are meant to be humorous, and admittedly some are, but most aren't worth paying attention to. There's limited variation in the style of humor employed throughout the book, so punchlines quickly become a chore to get through.If I wanted to introduce my friends to the zombie genre, this definitely would not be the book. It in no way made the zombie world come alive in any sort of imaginative way. Shame on you Max Brooks."
1,Boring Waste of Time,"I bought this title expecting the book to be at least mildly amusing given the author's heritage. No such luck. After forcing myself to read about 50 utterly boring pages, I gave up and sent the rendering to the ebook black hole (Amazon archive) never to be resurrected to blight my iPad again."
1,Very Dissapointed.,"I purchased this book as a last resort hoping against hope that it was the answer to my prayers. Sadly, after practicing and perfecting every strategy and technique presented, I am still plagued by Zombies. More accurately, one Zombie...my ex-wife. If anyone reading this review doubts the credibility of my claim, I will give you her contact info. One night with her and you will truly experience the horror of the 'Living-Dead'!"
1,Parody. Wow. My ribs hurt.,"I'm going to go ahead and give away the only mildly amusing thing in the 247 unfunny pages of this book. It takes itself seriously. It's an *actual* guide to zombie survival. There you go. Personally, that made me dryly chuckle for the first 5 pages. After that, it got annoying really, really fast. If you liked this novel, don't forget to pick up Max Brooks' other fantastic offerings:- The Unicorn Husbandry Guide- Trapping Leprechaun's for fun and profit- Pixies vs Fairies; which side to take in the coming Global confrontationThis book wasn't just bad, it was violently suckworthy. Whenever I see the name Max Brooks again, I'll be reminded of the old adage that talent skips a generation."
1,"Weak, boring, and unfunny","As a fan of zombie movies, I could not believe how badly Max Brooks botched the chance to write a funny book. This book is dry, dull, and drones endlessly on about boring details when it could have been the next Shawn of the Dead. Worse, as other reviewers have made clear, it doesn't even succeed as a serious book - the basic facts are poorly researched and sometimes self-contradictory, and it certainly isn't scary.Writing a book with this title is a golden opportunity to be hilariously tongue-in-cheek. Either Max Brooks decided to operate under the delusion that zombies are a real threat that requires actual preparation, or his tongue was so deeply embedded in his cheek that his laugh lines are completely indecipherable.If you are attacked by a zombie, give him this book to read. It will bore him to death."
2,An odd little book,"""The Zombie Survival Guide"" is quite an oddity. Not really funny enough to really be a successful parody and not serious enough (because, let's face it, the odds of an actual zombie attack are essentially nil) to be of any use. The book's main draw is that you can see Max Brooks' working out the material he'd put to vastly better use in his living-dead epic ""World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War."" So, I'd only recommend this to major fans of ""World War Z."" If you haven't read ""World War Z,"" then you absolutely should read it before even considering ""The Zombie Survival Guide."""
2,Didn't deliver.,I lent this book to my sister and it didn't work for @#$@#. She was recently trapped in a zombie rampage and reading the book did her a hell of a lot of good. She still didn't stand a chance against the undead hordes. They chewed her up like yesterday's lasagna.@#$ you Max Brooks!
4,zombiapocalypse,"Fun read. Quick and easy. The survival guide portion of the book gets a bit tedious but i understand the authors intentions. I have seen these guides in various forms in my local subversive book stores, and i can happily say i will never have to read one. The book takes off in the last chapters with the case studies. Apparently this is where WWZ starts? Whatever, grab it if your fascinated by the prospect of a zombie apocalypse."
1,Infantile,"This book was recommended to me as I enjoy most zombie films. I was grossly disappointed. The reading level is grade-school, the material is repetitious, graphics provide further filler material, and the information provided is no more incisive than watching any zombie movie - even a bad ""B movie"" at that!The tone of the book is not humorous, grotesque, frightening, clever, dramatic, serious, creepy or any other adjectives except... boring and bland. Also, The author attempts to supply first-hand, historical accounts of zombie attacks, but the wording of the quoted passages is anachronistic and still within the writer's ""voice.""In sum, I learned nothing from this ""survival guide"" and I was not entertained in the least."
2,not much of a survival guide,"ok, i was pretty disappointed with this ""survival guide"". especially compared to the amazing ""world war z"" book. the narrative style of the guide is very dry and boring, the illustrations are horrible (just should have been left out), and most of the content is repetitive (aim for the head/brain, aim for the head/brain, aim for the head/brain). the book had little humor to it (which would have made it more interesting) and very little in the way of usable survival information (you could get more useful information in a basic camping/outdoors book). i know the author is trying to explain how to survive fictional creatures, but it could have been better mixed in with real-world information to make it more believable.it's an interesting companion to WWZ but very disappointing compared to that book. i recommend that one well over this book."
1,Not even slightly funny,"I read this having heard that it was a humorous satire. This reads like a navy SEAL writing about how to survive armageddon except insert ""zombie"" for ""arab"", ""liberal"", etc. Not a laugh to be had and frankly something only a zombie fanatic or crazed militia member could even get through."
1,Let down,"Well, I'm not surprised the majority of the people gave this 4 and 5 star ratings. The majority of Americans are just plain dumb. This book is like the rantings of a prepubescent kid who just saw his first zombie movie, and feels it's his duty to ""educate"" the masses.Pretty much like the other 1 star reviewers have said...boring, not funny, not entertaining, not enough detail. I stopped reading when it got to underwater zombie fighting, which of all things, he felt it deserved 10 pages to explain.Bottom line: If you can think for yourself, take an hour and jot down a few ideas of what you would do in a zombie apocalypse (or any other epidemic) and you would have just saved yourself 10 bucks."
2,Not humorous at all.,"I can't remember laughing once reading this book. It is a decent horror book and the stories in the back are an okay read, but the bulk of the book is a waste of time. I hope that people don't take the book serious. In one chapter he describes that cooking and excercising should be done in the basement only to later tell you to hide upstairs and chop up the stairs so zombies can't get you."
2,Repetition over and over again,Of course it is a useless book but i was hoping that it would be more entertaining! Book is full of repetitions. I didn't even want to finish the book.Overall waist of money!
5,Zombies cool down,I'm nuts about Zombies and suggest that anyone who can't get enough of these books should read World War Z and The Zen of Zombie. You won't be disappointed.
3,Good,I haven't actually read it but my roommate liked it. I got it as a present for him because he likes zombies.
2,Could've been better!,"Interesting topic but just not a fan of the bullet point style of writing. Basically saying, this book literally could've been a list of do's and don'ts regarding a zombie attack instead of ~200pgs. I was expecting more based on the reviews, a lot more.He spends a lot of time analyzing dumb weapons you shouldn't use rather than playing with it more. I could see where he was trying to be funny or satirical but he only hit the mark with me a couple times. The other times I was just rolling my eyes. I just think this could've been so much more, bummer!After reading this everyone recommends WWZ, don't bother, I gave that one star."
3,The Zombie Survival Guide,"Now, I know I am doing the right thing ""just in case"" but we all know it will happen sooner that later. My kids love for me to read this book to them, it does make a great bedtime book. Now as a family we can protect each other. Now as a family we can protect our self's from each other. Great coffee table book too. Have fun reading........"
3,"Good read, but not by a qualified warfighter","The Zombie Survival Guide is a good read, but it's not written by a qualified warfighter. Although he makes some good suggestions, his tips on weapons are off. The .22 caliber round will not penetrate skull at distances of beyond 50m.For more accurate tips regarding combating Zombies, you can check out FM 999-3, Counter-Zombie Operations at the Fireteam Level. Best thing about it is that it is free and is updated from time to time."
2,Review From a Book Devouring Stay at Home Mom,i thought this book was lame.it was like a guide for wartime boyscouts.the only good parts were the incident reports from survivors and govt agencies.
2,Read the Zombie Survival Wiki instead,"I bought this book after reading ""world war z"" which frankly woke me up to the threat of the undead. Unfortunately, my high hopes were dashed. Although the dead pan delivery is amusing at times, the book's quite boring. And even more irritating, after I bought the book, I found an excellent site where just about everything Brooks writes is there and for free ([...]). From home defence to choice of weapons, it's all there. Finally, this is a book for Americans, with their [..] and gun stores and huge outdoors. Not for the majority of humanity who live in smaller crowded countries with far stricter gun laws and less of the great outdoors to escape to."
5,Excellent...,"Listen...I'm not a huge horror fiction fan, but this was very well done...Just like a proper survival manual, FUNNY! And, the short accounts of attacks at the end were chilling and well written. Were zombies medically possible, Max Brooks would have sold me on this completely. Well done."
5,Essential,"The Zombie survival guide: Complete protection from the Living Dead is a must for any person who is worried about zombie survival. Giving chapters and break downs of outbreaks, how to fortify your environment, and how to better protect yourself from the invading horde, this very essential book is a must for your bug out bag. Don't find yourself in an invasion without it!The actual review:I really enjoyed this book. Zombies had always fascinated me, so to find a book that treated them like a real and true voice in the world just made me giggle. I read the book on a long car ride from Florida, and it kept me amused basically the whole time. It's set up like a real survival book, so the humor may be lost on a few. It's definitely a fun one to include on your book shelf or to keep in your car. Great conversation piece. Max Brooks has really out done himself with writing a detailed guide about how to stay away from an oncoming horde of the undead. Great book to have!"
4,impressively detailed,"I was prepared for a cheesy gift-book feel when I opened this one up, and was surprised to find out how in-depth it was. Someone was taking this very seriously, and it's the kind of thing that can be read more than once. Nice!"
2,don't waste your time or money,"i love the zombie genre and loved World War Z, but this book is simply dull and boring. move on..."
5,Hilarious gift,The illustrations are priceless. My brother loved getting this as a gift! Hopefully he'll learn a thing or two. lol
3,somewhat tedious read,I read this book after world war z and to be honest I'm glad I did as I found myself skimming over large parts of the book as it revealed nothing new about the genre and was repetitive and quite tedious to read. World war z on the other hand sparkles with originality and I have recommended it to a number of friends.
4,Book of Fun!,A very odd look int a fictional world. A great way to spend thinking about the great zombie what if scenario.
5,well worth a read,"this book is great for a laugh, but it also gives you a lot of sound advice in the event of an actual pandemic level disease outbreak. it has a lot of great survival tips, and a fair bit of humor as well. definitely worth it."
3,Got a Little Tiring,"Although initially I had great enthusiasm for the book, after I got half way through it I became increasingly bored. Though some of the author's ideas were great, the book could have been condenced into a hundred and fifty pages and I found myself wondering if my time could have been better spend reading a zombie novel instead."
5,"It could save your live, if it ever happens","The zombie survial guide may seem like it would only apeal to horror buffs, but the truth is: this is a book for everyone. Although the threat of a zombie attack isnt aparent,this book is an intersting read and could be read like a novel. For the serious undead fan, it is a opportuntiy you dont want pass up. of course the odds of being eaten by a zombie(theres no proof they are they are real, but no proof they aren't) is about the same of being probed by little green men, theres still that chance...this book may not seem relivent but it is one of the most entertaining books on the market today. remember, no place is safe, only safer."
3,Not bad. Kinda fun.,"Read this book and be advised that you'll spend the next day or three examining your home, workplace, church, grocery store and other buildings in your area as potential zombie defense areas - and you'll be mapping out the distance to the closest gun store, military post, food sources and so on.Then you'll wake up and realize that this is a fun exercise that makes you aware of your own craziness. Best part of the book is the histories of outbreaks over the years.Read this and get Brook's other zombie novels. Good reading."
4,Great book for zombie fans,"I liked this book. It was a great spoof of those other ""worst case"" handbooks and a great read."
1,This books pretense is almost as big as it was dissapointing,"The book was amazingly lame, and boring.I feel ripped off. Infact I have been! Take a look at all the reviews here. They are mostly 5 stars, and written with the same manner, tone, and style. Then there are a group of reviews(real ones) which take the complete opposite view (the book is terrible). The amount of these reviews are around the average amount that an unimportant book like this would receive. Obviously the author has just been compensating for his own incompetence by adding fake reviews.In summary: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,This was a hit,"I purchased this book for my 7th grade nephew who is interested in all things having to do with Zombies. He was reading it on a family vacation and he LOVED it so much he read it cover to cover in 2 days. The funny thing was that, probably because of his age, he completely didn't get the fact that the book was a parody on zombies. He took all of it very seriously and he would come in and fill us all on little known zombie facts. I thought I was going to die laughing.My 30-something brother picked it up and just had a great time with it. He said it was a fun and interesting read. We capped off the trip with a Zombie movie marathon that the boys analyzed for us with their new knowledge of Zombies.Bottom line: both loved it and gave it 5 stars."
4,Be Ready!,"I am now prepared for the zombie apocalypse. If it should come (and I know it will), I will have this book in one hand and a M1 Carbine Rifle in the other. Great book if you want to be ready."
3,Running from zombies or reading stereo instructions?,"I'm a big fan of zombies and thought this would be a riot. It is amusing, but is written like a user manual for putting a shelving unit together. I only got through about half of it because it was so repetitive. If you're looking for story format, definitely read World War Z. This book just didn't cut it for me."
5,you might be dead already,"Take this book as humor,fiction or whatever blows your hair back.But when SHTF, knowlege will be your best tool.Step one to true survival is being aware to all bad situations.It may never happen but if it does having this book in your bag will make you more confident."
5,Great resource!,"VERY entertaining read. I'll probably be reading over and over, because it was so entertaining. I actually started believing it after a while of reading and had to step back and remember, ZOMBIES ARE NOT REAL! Great book!"
3,Too many choices when facing Z-Day.,"This book was highly entertaining. Fictional works that are written seriously can make for some great dark comedy. Where this book drops the ball is its format, though. When buying this book, I was hoping to humorously find new ways to battle the undead if and when the time arises. But as much as I enjoyed some of the scenarios, I never felt like I recieved a concrete answer as to what would be the best options for ultimate survival.The book often times lists the pros and cons of various types of weapons. But what is never answered is ""But what's the best combination?"" The book ends up being pretty pointless for survival if every page lists pros of items but then contridicts the reasons, without ever giving a solution.Overall and interesting read, but not what I was looking for."
4,Zombies no more,"At first i'd thought it be stupid, but after reading it it is informative and humorous. It leaves no leaf unturned as far as avoiding zombie attack and gives many examples. Great read, would recommend if looking for something different than your average book."
5,The Zombie Survival Guide,My son's girlfriend is REALLY in to zombies. Once she opened this package at Christmas we lost her completely except for tidbits about zombies and how to fight them. Definitely a hit among the young zombie crowd.
5,Must Have,"You must have this Survival Guide, study it and be prepared, otherwise you will be one of the first to go!"
4,BRAINZZZZZ!,"When hordes of the undead come knocking on your doorstep for brains you need to know the difference between fact and fiction of ""How to Survive."" There is no middle ground - you either become a ravenous inductee of the living dead, become their next banquet, or you vanquish them with extreme prejudice and begin repopulating the world!"
5,Zombie Protection,"Although I couldnt sit down and read this book cover to cover, I really enjoyed picking it up every so often when I had 5 minutes and getting a quick snippet of some life saving advice, should the zombies rise."
3,an honest zombie survival guide,A funny gag gift but overall not the greatest read. Takes a very serious and honest approach to dealing with a zombie apocalypse. This is not really a story but a true guide.
4,Better then Army Survival Guide,Lots of helpful information to allow me to prepare for the Zombie apocalypsis and the next person who breaks into my house.
5,Believable,"I've always been fascinated by believable fiction. Max Brooks brings to the table information that is so near authentic, I almost went out to begin filling a survival shopping list. The accounts, information and suggestions in this work areso believable, you'll be jumping at sounds in the night! Bravo!"
5,I feel safe!,Awesome book. Tells you everything you need to know for surviving the zombie apocalypse and a little more. It's a must read.
3,Has me looking at the world in a whole new way,"Weirdly convincing guide to surviving the zombie hoards that may be lurking down that dark alley next to your parking garage, inside that abandoned building you ride your bike past every day, or underneath your canoe as you glide peaceably on vacation. To ensure your safety in the case of a zombie outbreak near you, follow the author's detailed instructions. Only those who have prepared ahead of time will survive the ultimate zombie apocalypse. After reading this book, I find myself scouting out the buildings in my neighborhood and wondering which ones would be most easily defensible? Which people would I want in my zombie hide-a-way? Who do I know that owns a desert island where we could be safe from the infection? Though written in a dry, almost boring tone, I was strangely compelled to keep reading . . . you know, just in case I need this information someday."
3,Not bad but..,"Uhh.. I didnt read all of it , but at least 1/3 and .. yeah , zombie survival.. This guy doesnt knows muchits all about zombies and he never include Scenarios where other humans attack you. and yeah , its HIS Opinion on zombie survivalbut half of this book is BS"
5,For my brother...,"I haven't read the book, but all of my friends did back in high school and they loved it, so I bought one for my brother for Christmas. I always see him reading it so he must enjoy it too. Also, he is in high school now so it's an interesting book he can use in his classes for book reports. DISCLAIMER: I HAVEN""T READ THE BOOK MYSELF."
2,"Not bad, not good","This was an interesting read. I guess in a tongue in cheek kind of way. Yes I am into the zombie genre of fiction. Yes I have read World War Z. So why no 5 star rating like most of the others? Well the author doesn't know much about firearms for one thing. He doesn't know much about combat for another. And lastly he knows very little about survival. So in a tongue in cheek sort of way it is entertaining. If you are looking for a survival book check into SAS survival handbook or something of that nature. If you want an entertaining read. This can kind of give you that. But it is a very short book, the information contained is inaccurate and it comes off as a little silly. I couldn't give it 1 star because it does actually have some entertainment value. Beyond that it really is just a misinformed author giving advise on topics he has no idea about."
5,Great Read!,Very entertaining! I love how it is written as tried and true fact. You can easily get lost in the text thanks to the great amount of detail that allows your imagination to paint vivid images in your head. 1/2 way through and enjoying it thoroughly!
4,good enough to replace a lost copy.,"great book, lost my 1st copy few years back due to Hurricane Katrina (sure needed a book to read during that time), finally replaced it. came on the date expected, book spine damaged a little, but nothing to fuss about. the book goes in a nice in-depth, and well thought out descriptions on understanding and surviving a zombie attack. entertaining! would recommend, and actually got another copy for a gift for a friends' birthday coming up."
5,Must have for any Zombie Fan,I don't have to tell you how great this book is. If you are a fan of the genre this is a MUST HAVE! period
3,i havent read the book but please read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i havent read the book but how do you know these would be the right things to do but could be so id give it a 2 and a half because how do you know
3,Fair at best.,I know it is supposed to be satire but it was a bit dull. Watch any movie and you can figure out what this book tells you in 30 seconds.
4,great book,this book is awesome its grounded in reality and takes itself seriously. i would recomend this book to anybody intrested in zombies.
5,awesome book,so far this book is going great! completly has me thinking of what to do when the zombie apocalypse happens! i love it and very entertaining! its corky and makes you think of some of those ideas that you thought you would do if this happens might now work. but also gives you some great ideas on what weapons are best and some of the best places to go if mayhem happens!
3,It was hard to go from a War World Z to this,"Okay...it was a mistake. I read War World Z and then picked this one up. Not a good idea. If you are looking for something as a gag gift, here you are."
5,entire family owns this,My family loves this book. I just bought my son his second copy since someone took his. We engage in many fun conversations of zombie survival
5,She Loved it,I Bought this for my wife who is a zombie fanatic and she has gone off non stop about how the book tells you how to survive a Z-D-Day or 12/21/12 xD good book though
5,Fun time!,Fun reading. Author makes you feel as though you are truly preparing for the Zombie Apocalypse! I'm ready for anything now lol.
2,Meh,It was funny for the first twenty pages and then the novelty wore off quickly. Plus now Amazon thinks I'm a huge zombie head and my recommendations are ruined.
5,A gift for my son,"I bought this as a gift for my sons birthday when he turned 17. Of course, he loves it! He still has it!"
4,Zombie guide indeed,"This is the first Max Brooks Zombie book I read and liked. Survival Guide indeed. This book talks about how Zombie outbreak occured, how the goverments conceals it. It shares stories from around the world from past outbreaks. Nothing like World War Z. But this guide does one thing that no other book does. It prepares you. This book is fiction but is written as if it is true. It tells you what weapons to use, what mode of transportation to use, How to travel, how to fight, what to wear. Even how to work together to stay alive. What I find interesting about this book is that: One can take away from this book as use its techniques. You don't have to have a zombie outbreak, this book could have helped the victims of Katrina, future survivors of most disaters.I recommend you read this book for pure enjoyment, for others who can comprehend that this is a true survival guide, will get even more out of it."
5,ZOMBIES,"I am a huge zombie fan and like 90% of my dvds are some form of zombie movie. about 2 years ago my girlfriend got me this book and i've since read it atleast 5 times. it's written so seriously like it's a real survival guide, sometimes i get so into it I forget it's fake.i recommend to any and all zombie fans"
5,"I actually had to buy a replacement copy because a zombie stole my original-- signed, personally, by MAX BROOKS!","This is an excellent book!I've been reading up about the subject, and fear for my life.My friends at work figure that 6 NOVEMBER is the last day oflife as we know it!I'm scared!I'm afraid to venture out of my neighborhood at night, so Ijust ordered this from Amazon.No brainer there!Get one today... before it's TOO LATE!Gotta run!""Big Mac"""
3,Ok but nothing Great,Its an OK book. the encounters in the end of the book did not hold my interest. I read this to be a primer for WWZ but didn't need to.
3,"Ok, but a bit pricey.","An interesting work of ""fiction"". Very verbose. But is very very interesting. A bit pricy for what it is. Does have some interesting ""tips on zombies""."
5,Love it!,"Very informative on not only how to survive zombies, but really how to survive anything! If the zombie apocalypse actually happens I will be well prepared!"
3,Cut out zombies...,... and you'd have a pretty good book on survival and sustainability in a post-apocalyptic world alone. A good warmup to World War Z.
5,Cool,"Nice guide, good advice. Almost everything you need to know about the zombie apocalypse, the historical accounts are scary and creepy."
3,Just okay,"I didn't love this book. It was humorous, and I'm not sure what I expected exactly, but for all the hubbub surrounding it, I was less than impressed. It seemed to drag on at some point, especially in the history sections, although this is also where I thought it shined -- explaining historical events as zombie uprisings."
3,not bad,moderately entertaining. Seems to be an overall disaster prepardness program. Zombies or a commentary on society in general. Good Points.
3,Kinda long for Being satire,But it was a gift and that someoneLiked it so is good not too bad for the price !
3,What would we do without it?,"Though I have never been attacked by a zombie, I can now rest a bit more easily knowing that there is a guide to help us survive if need be. Unless there is an actual zombie attack, this book is more a fun read and less a manual. I would pick this up if you are looking to feed your inner geek and chuckle."
3,I'm prepared,"This is a good fun read. You will learn everything you need to know on surviving the zombie apacolype. It is really more detailed and accurate than I could have imagined. My three star rating is simple. I read Word War Z first. Easily one of my favorite books of all time. That one had so much action in it that I almost got a little bored reading these survival tips. But it is what it advertises. A survival guide and from everything from weapons, exercise routines, housing, food etc etc et..... This recorded attacks where the best part. It seems to clash with World War Z's cannon though."
4,NOT FOR ZOMBIES!,"As Zombie, me thought ""Zombie Survival Guide"" for help Zombie survive. No case... Me remember read subtitle next time. Do not read if Zombie, but especially do avoid the reading if human. No help for you here."
5,MUST-HAVE FOR FANS OF THE LIVING DEAD,PURE GENIUS...IF YOU ARE A FAN OF ZOMBIE FILMS OR ANTICIPATING AN OUTBREAK OF LIVING DEAD IN YOUR AREA: YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK. IT IS VERY FUNNY AND YOU WILL FIND MANY CLEVER INSIGHTS TO ZOMBIE SURVIVAL.
4,They ain't gonna eat ME!!!!,A book for all those willing to make a stand against any impending zombie attacks. Well thought out and presented with fool proof ways to avert your potential death. I will survive. YOU????
4,Prepare yourself for the zombie uprising!,"Zombies are bearing down on your position. What do you take with you?Ax or flame thrower?Truck or bicycle?Max Brooks has the answers.This book had me laughing one minute and in awe the next. While reading this, I almost wanted a zombie uprising to occur, just to put to use the detailed instructions Brooks gives.If you're a fan of zombie fiction, then you will likely enjoy what is on offer here. Just be aware that it isn't really a narrative, but an exhaustive guide on how best to survive myriad zombie situations."
3,Interesting read if you're a zombie fanatic.,"I read this after World War Z, also by Max Brooks, although The Zombie Survival Guide was written first. Gets boring at times but humorously interesting to see that someone other than myself has made such concise and drawn out plans for if the dead were ever to rise and cannabalize the living."
