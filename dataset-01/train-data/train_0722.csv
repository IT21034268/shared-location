3,Its only fun for a little while.,"This game can be very fun...for a while. But sadly even with all the innovative customization and game play. It gets old. The only fun part after about a hour is changing your creature. The running around gets redundant and once you """"evolve"" the game play..in my opinion..sucks.Pros: Customize your creature.Innovative ideasGood controls and Graphics.Cons:Gets boring fastEvolving stage game play gets a 4 out of 10high resource hog.Up to 4gb of HDD space taken."
4,Don't buy this! That is - if you want to get anything done!,"Wow was this a game. My kids and their friends (ages range from 8 to 12) can't get enough of it. I think I bought it maybe 10 months ago and it is still close to the most played game on our computer. Neighbor kids come over to play the game and ignore my kids! I can't claim to have played it personally, but I can see how well liked it is by kids that age."
1,"Great game, poor Company.","This is a great game.Unfortionately, the insane DRM laws make it almost impossible for someone who with more than 1 PC, or who upgrades their PC more than once in their lifetime to play this game long term.I still play games like the The Sims (1), with all of its expansions. Why? Because it's a quality game. Now, I'm already regretting my purchase, because I enjoy the game, and that means that at some point, I'm going to have to fork over 50 dollars more if I want to continue playing."
4,Good Game on par with the Sims and Sim City 4,"I have seen many reviews that give this game one star for the DRM, DRM is not the game and should not effect the games review score. I have had no problems with the DRM as I only installed the game once and am not trying to PIRATE the game.The game itself is very fun and easy to play, my 3 year old can play the early stages of the game by herself. The game does offer more complexity in later stages for older players.The online features are very fun to use, sharing creatures with friends and family adds longevity to the game as a holeUnless you are looking to pirate this game the DRM is not an issue."
1,Can you consider this a game.,With consoles you can buy a game and bring it over to a friends house and put it in their xbox and play with them. Apparently EA thinks there just lending us this game for a while. We cant play it at our friends. We can't install it on another machine. And when you buy another computer your just going to lose it and those discs are going to be good for nothing but flimsy frisbees.
1,Backwards thinking holding back good game,You would think they would know that DRM ruins the game experience but not in this case.1 Star.
1,Stop with the DRM!,"The Digital Rights Management to 'protect' this game is pointless. It punishes honest users purchasing the game by limiting the number of times it can be reinstalled, yet the protection is already cracked and dishonest people are playing the game with no restrictions, for free. DRM only hurts the people who play fair, not the criminals it was meant to stop. I'll buy this game when EA decides to treat their paying customers fairly, how am I supposed to play this without the internet??"
1,No to DRM,I can not believe in this day and age companies have not figured out that DRM only hurts them with little to no help. I can not endorse a product that uses draconian methods of DRM.
1,Only 3 Activations,"I bought this game the other day because it sounded fun and it is fun. But you only get 3 activations of the game over the internet. Right after I installed the game and activated it something happened to my hard drive while instilling some updates for Windows and I ended up having to reinstall Windows. So right off the bat I loose two of my Activations and now I only have one left. Once I run out you know you will have to fight EA games for weeks jumping through all kinds of hoops to get another Activation Credit ""WHAT FUN"". I would think twice before buying this game because of this."
1,"Oh Boy, Another DRM Review","Yes, it's true. Another person whining about the DRM - But for good reason! WHAT was EA thinking? I wish I would have known about this before I bought the game otherwise I never would have.If anything, this DRM is encouraging people to pirate - NOT discouraging it. After your 3 activations limit is hit, you'll be forced to find a pirated copy to even play your own account. I think it's disgusting how EA is trying to make more money by attempting to get their customers to re-purchase this game. I reformat/reinstall the OS on my computer every 3-4 months. My game would be useless in less than a year. Ridiculous!DRM is a menace to society. It hurts the companies using it because all it does is piss people off enough to want to find ways to circumvent it. (And believe me, they will) It punishes thousands of honest people just to try to get at the few dishonest ones.Well the reviews are speaking for themselves..."
1,"DRM is a Step Back, Show EA We Won't Have Any of it!","DRM is strangling PC gaming. DRM is punishing the legitimate customers who bought the game.Until the video game industry wakes up and smells the burnt discs, they will never figure out why piracy is on the rise, and regular people are reluctant to buy their games. I refuse to purchase any game that acts like I just rented it. I refuse to buy any game that limits the number of times I can install it. I uninstall and reinstall games quite often to save on hard drive space. I won't buy a game that will stop working for me one day just because I installed it too much.It's too bad to. I was looking forward to Spore, it looks like a fun game. But EA's draconian methods to control something I've already bought are a deal breaker for me. I hope this game tanks EA. I hope you learn your lesson."
1,Another sale lost due to DRM,"I logged on to Amazon.com with the intent of purchasing this game today, as I, like many of you, have been excited about Spore since it was introduced 3 years ago. But after the long wait, I will not be buying this game with the DRM. No more root kits! We must send a message to these companies that punishing their innocent and loyal customers is NOT the way to fight piracy."
1,I will not buy it because of DRM,"I came to Amazon to buy it, but clearly the DRM is repulsive and malware in nature. I will not buy it. I would have purchased two copies, one for me and one for a friend. Say good bye to my $100 EA!"
1,"Nice game, bad DRM","Can I give you my money for the product and just use it without having to worry about what your installing? You know, I understand the need for some control, but this is ridiculous and it doesn't work. Nice work publisher."
2,Cannot Save Games,"The DRM doesn't affect me at all, but what does is that it's unplayable. I have an all Nvidia setup in my computer w/ 8600GT Vid Card, 2gig RAM, Plenty of space, etc... However, upon trying to save a game it crashes and all is lost. I was told eventually to return the game to the store and get a new one. Done, and same issue occured. Until there's a patch for this it's a $50 paper weight.So much for 2 years of personal anticipation."
1,Another reviewer sick of overzealous copy protection,I will not buy this game. I recommend that you do not either based on the copy protection scheme that can possibly ruin your computer.
1,"Decent game, drm was a PITA","I tried the demo version a month ago, it was pretty cool. But the full version had all sorts of bugs in the installer. I don't understand why publishers pay so much money to license securom for their games, when it doesn't stop piracy at all! The DRM is frustrating for exactly ONE of the pirates, and for ALL the rest of the legitimate customers. The only people it doesn't bother are ALL of the pirates, and the few customers that don't realize how much simpler and faster the pirated version is.I feel like the people who add DRM to their games are saying ""The beatings will continue until morale improves."" The game itself was interesting, but hardly earthshattering. But I only had a few minutes to play it before bed, since it took me hours of work to install."
1,The DRM spoils the game.,"It has already been stated many times that the DRM spoils the game. I too support that position. To limit the installation to 3 and tie the game to EA licensing servers, is simply ridiculus. At some point in time (years from now), EA will shut the server off because it will cost more money to operate than they are making. With no legal requirements to maintain the server, they can do just that. As a result, you are left with no options. This has been tried on many music MP3 websites that have since gone out of business leaving the suckers (customers) who bought music with a library that they can no longer use. I find this unacceptable and as such, I reject Spore, Mass Effect, and any other EA game that utilizes this business model."
1,is it just me or does securom look like scrotum?,"So EA killed just about every game on console machines by dumbing down the ""sequels"" and releasing more sequels because people stopped buying them. Now EA is killing the few good PC games that were new and unique. Pitty, but at least there are other fantastic properties out there to actually own.I was actually going to buy this for many of my friends, as this is the time for birthdays, but i think we'll all play a different game instead (It probably won't be the new red alert).EA may feel like they can't win. And the answer is yes, you can't win with your current tactics. But at least you'll own most of the franchises even though they don't sell. There's a good win!"
1,Mediocre game but installs malware on your computer,"A rather lacklustre evolution simulator that unfortunately comes bundled with incredibly restrictive DRM and installs a virus-like rootkit called SecuROM on your PC. The rootkit is authorized to call corporate servers and send specifics about your computer to Electronic Arts. It also disables some programs (WinDVD) and interferes with the operation of other programs (sometimes even anti-virus scanners) while using up system resources permanently. It cannot be removed, even if you uninstall Spore.Consequently, this game will be unusable a few years from now and the SecuROM DRM is considered a hazard to your PC's health."
1,A poor attempt to block the secondary market,"As someone who purchases half of my games used, I cannot support a company that wishes to eliminate the resale market with their DRM. Setting aside the issue of a ""security"" system that makes a game unplayable -- as many reviewers have already discussed -- when I purchase a game, DVD, book, or CD, I have every right to resell that item if I choose.Sorry, EA: the early press had me excited about this game. But between the DRM virus and the poor support for MacOS, you've lost a customer."
1,I bought this game and now I wish I hadn't,"I bought this game without knowing it used SecuROM DRM. I boycotted Bioshock for it's use of SecuROM. While I think all DRM is bad, some are better then others and some I will even put up with it's brokenness. To me SecuROM crosses the line and I will not tolerate it. Now I have to figure out how to get it off my system. I'll probably just reformat my hard drive and re-install Windows. What a pain. :("
1,Why give money to a company who thinks you're a thief?,"I won't pay money for a product which artificially restricts the ability of the user to use their legitimately purchased software as they wish on their own computer. Too bad, I was quite looking forward to the game and was willing to purchase it for my Mac until I was made aware of the DRM system in place. The people have spoken EA, although you're probably too stubborn to admit the mistake and put it right."
1,Spore is the Black&White of 2008!,"Spore is the Black&White of 2008! Just like Black&White, it's the very definition of ""overhyped""! Essentially you're buying a creature creator and a bunch of mini-games. While amusing, the fun factor wears off quickly. Oh yeah, and thanks to the draconian DRM (thanks EA!), you're not really buying it you're RENTING it!"
1,A species-engine in search of a game,"I enjoy creating species as much as anyone, but this game was tedious enough the first time around and has zero replay. The only point at which this game was remotely fun was the final space-age stage, at which it resembled a more customizable but far less satisfying version of Space Rangers and Space Rangers 2."
1,Return Please,"I can't help but agree with the comments here. Instead of feeling like an owner of an exciting game, I feel like a criminal. And of course you can't return the thing since the seal is broken. Grats EA on robbing me. What a fool I am."
1,Why I don't like the game,"Yeah The game is alright, the creature creator feel like its more fun than the game itself after a while. The DRM does suck but its not the end of the world for me.Btw to the people who said 1 star review are people who download it from warez you may want to check cause last i remember the warez place have it a week before we got it and they crack the thing on it already. reported by many site."
1,$50 for a game for RENT? No thanks. Lost 3 family purchases here.,"As it has been put, THIS GAME IS FOR RENT....FOR $50.DRM in the form of the horrendous SECURom absolutely ruined the game and they lost 3 sales to my family.I will not purchase any game with SECURom or any game with an installation limit. 3? 5? 10? It doesn't matter. If I legally purchase the game, I can legally install it one million times if I so choose.ALL GAME REVIEWS NEED A NEW SECTION CALLED ""DRM"". It can go with grapics/gameply/sound/originality. BUT THE THING IS...A PERFECT 10 IN THE OTHER CATEGORIES AND A 0 IN DRM, MEANS A 0 OVERALL.This game is a dud. A Zero. I hope it is the most pirated game ever and EA loses their arse on it. They deserve nothing less than a fiasco."
4,"Spore is a truly original game,But you feel cheated.","The game is well,One of a kind.I have never played anything like it....Its fun also heh.The game has problems like most,and there is little to no story,But none the less,great.The DRM thing is blown way out,It's not like most people Have 3 Computers anyway.Hopefully they will make a Spore 2 to fill in the game(With a story),No matter how great the game is..You feel kinda cheated in the end.But anyway Its original and fun,Good luck!"
2,not as good as I could have hoped,"I was really excited for the game when I downloaded a demo for the create creator. I was even still excited while playing the game. That is, until I got past the creature stage. After that the game was boring. I still like to make creatures in it, ignoring the stats and all that, but I don't play the rest of the content.I wish someone would take this idea and mature it. Better graphics, more parts, abilities of parts based on stats you give your creature and not which part you choose, so on, and so forth. Maybe make different run animations, because not all animals move the same. Maybe even have some way of differentiating genders, even if it's just different sizes. Take this game and shake it up a little, and it could be a lot better."
1,"Spore, the great disappointment","Its not often we casual gamers feel sad. Normally insults seem to be the way of the extreme, the lack-of this insane feature. However terse my language, SPORE is disappointing on two fronts.1) DRM. I am all for buying games and for paying the creator, but to limit the installations to 3 is like telling me when I buy a sound system I am only allowed to play 3 genre's of music.2) Simplistic gameplay with an unrealistic concept of conquering. I am in space phase right now, but the stages before this phase were nothing but a disappointment. Simplistic style of gameplay without many options for strategy made me feel like I was playing those old ""Magic School Bus"" games from my elementary era. Sure I was exploring, but it was more like watching a film than controlling the action.Spore can be saved, but just like Windows, I believe it needs a SP1.-im out"
1,Securom Must go down and EA with it if we have to,Securom has destroyed many computers that otherwise would be fine so dont let ea destroy your computer also
1,"What, are you trying to be Microsoft, RIAA or MPAA?","The game may be wonderful, but I am not going to put with multiple authorization procedures! I go through that at work, to access sensitive information. THIS IS A GAME! EA, GET OVER YOURSELVES!"
1,Waited so long,"I've been waiting for this game since they announced it so many years ago, singing it's praises from the hilltop.Now I can't even buy it because of the DRM. I'm having computer problems now and am in the process of buying a new computer, I know I'm going to go over the 3 installs that are allowed just trying to get my computer to accept it, so now I can't even play the game that I've waited so long for.Thanks DRM.They don't even need a DRM on this, the game links up to a server and they can just have it check to make sure its got a unique ID code like so many other games do. Total bs."
1,no more drm please,i refuse to buy a game with this kind of drmea also doesn't deserve my money with the way they generally treat their talented employees
1,not again with the DRM,"I bought Mass Effect for the PC, and I refuse to buy another game with over the top DRM. I really hope EA listens to it's customers and stops treating them like theives. The DRM does nothing to prevent pirates, the game was released as a torrent the same day EA released it, so why punish legit users?"
1,DRM'd to Hell - Otherwise maybe possibly fun,"I have intermittent internet access, and when I found out (unpleasantly) about the Creature Creator's ""phone-home"" DRM, I was miffed about the $10 that I donated to their cause.I won't be buying Spore for the same reason that I didn't buy Bioshock, or any other game that I know to have such a restrictive DRM system."
1,Yucky DRMs,If you like the Sims you should probably like this game I just refomatted my computer because of problems with Mass Effect and its damn DRM! for those who don't know it DRMs are virus like programs that install on your computer without your knowledge in my case it created big problems I refuse to buy software that uses this intrusive type of software! Shame on you EA
1,Awesome Game - DRM too much to stand for,"Once again copy protection has made a paid-for version inferior to the hacked. I just don't understand the logic here.If I BUY a movie, they force me to watch five minutes of federal warnings I can't skip. If I just download the AVI, I can instantly watch the movie. Hacked version superior.If I buy this game, I can only install it three times and it puts invasive software on my machine that I can't remove. If I download the hacked version that appeared in the first 24 hours of release ANWAY, then I get no invasive software and can play forever. Hacked version superior.If these companies want to beat piracy they need to smarten up and stop alienating their user bases by treating them like kids who can't reach the cookie jar."
5,"Great game, lots of fun.","(...)For everyone else, ignore all the doom and gloom criers and get Spore! It's a great game that you can play over and over again because each time you play will be different. Sure the basic them and plot (if any) will be the same but unless you make all the same choices throughout the game, it will be a different game.I enjoy trying different things while creating my creatures, some work and some don't, but that's the who fun of the game.I actually bought Spore twice. The first one was bought through the EA store as a downloadable game. That was before I knew of the Galactic edition. But once I saw the Galactic edition and all the extras that came with it, I enjoy the game so much I had to have it."
1,"As much as I want to, I will NOT be buying this game","I have been so looking forward to this game, and I was ready to order it as soon as it came out... Unfortunately though, I WON'T be buying it, due to the insane DRM system that it uses.I don't mind some degree of reasonable copy-protection, but I'm not willing to pay for a game that I can only install 3 times.If they ever decide to release a version without this ridiculous level of DRM, I'll HAPPILY give them my money. Until then, there's no way, regardless of how great the game may be otherwise."
1,"Wow, I have to agree","This whole DRM agenda with EA is outrageous - and this is coming from a guy who buys all of his music off of iTunes. The DRM technology is a decent attempt to prevent ""piracy"" - which is really just file sharing, not piracy by any means - and has a medium that needs to be met with the customer. When you destroy a product, such as SPORE, with the a DRM that only allows 3 installs, you are pushing normal, dedicated customers to start file sharing. And once you start, there is no reason to stop. If my machine could run spore, i would be more inclined to acquire it through seedier means than to be submitted to EA's bad business practices."
1,DRM is Unconstitutional,"I remember the good old days when a man could buy a game, play it on his computer, and not have to worry about big brother or have to check in with him every once in a while. When you pay for this game, you're not really purchasing it. You're just renting it. You'll be allowed to use it on three different computer and the game will have to ""check in"" and validate your copy when there are any updates made to it. Spore, one of the most versatile games ever made, will tie you with a chain to a big ball with DRM written all over it."
1,You wont sell games calling customers thieves!,Way to turn people off to an anticipated game by calling them thieves and hurting the comsumers who DID want to buy the game
1,Why would I rent a bad game when I can buy so many good ones,"Supposedly, the game itself is mediocre, but it could be amazing and that wouldn't excuse the crazy DRM. All of the people who are going to steal the game already have and they are playing the unhindered version right now. The rest of us get to choose to not buy it or rent a game from EA. In a given year, I probably upgrade something in my computer once or twice and reformat at least once in addition. That means I'd have to pay $50/year to play this game.... No thanks. I'll go buy a good game and pay $50 for a lifetime copy."
1,Bland Gameplay,"I had high hopes for this game, after reading about it in the news and knowing the pedigree of its creators. Unfortunately, while the concept had tremendous potential, the execution is very bland. There is not enough to do until you get to the last stage of the game. Each of the early stages are very simple and the transitions are done poorly."
1,Don't care about DRM - this game is boring as hell,"OK... I'll start off by saying that I don't like the DRM thing any more than anybody else here does. However, I kind of have the feeling that if you buy a game with DRM, you don't really have the right to complain about it, because you knew it ahead of time.That said, Spore is boring as hell. The gameplay doesn't really seem very realistic and requires that you have an inhumanly long attention span. It may be interesting to create a giant waddling dog turd (once) but it gets old really quick. As for the rest of it, it's just dull.My recommendation: Pass."
1,DRM is a no go,"Their DRM copy protection is outrageous. Limiting to 3 installs for a full price PC game is not going to cut it. They are inconveniencing their customers for a game many have anticipated for many years. To prove the folly of gimping their official disc, I think I'll pass for now. My pirated copy will keep me busy in the interim.NO THANK YOU EA!"
1,not for the seasoned gamer,"The reviews complaining about the DRM are missing the mark. Spore is so bad that you won't want to play it more than once. The only fun part of the game (the cell stage) is a near-clone of the much earlier game flOw. Spore is really a fine example of ""scope creep"" - if they had focused on making it fun instead of demoing its grand ambitions, it could have been a great game."
1,DRM - count me out,"I like the look of the game, but will avoid now that I know it has aggressive DRM. I don't like to pay money and then be treated like a potential criminal. There are better ways to spend my time and money."
5,AWESOME!!!,"Spore is a five star game. You get to create your own creature- from a one-cell organism to creatures like us. It's the best ever!!!Anonymous, age 9"
1,I have multiple computers and wipe them clean frequently,"This is a good game. I give it 4/5 for the content of the game itself.Though not many people many agree with evolution, but being able to create from sketch a civilization is the first of its kind and the idea that this game stands for is a major creativity breakthrough that has been so lacking in game published recently (most of the most profitable games are sequels... COD4, GTA4, etc) This game definitely puts the innovations from Will Wright's simulation series into people's mind, again.While not mind-blowing, the graphic of the game is itself sufficient to present the structure of the game flawlessly.All the goods, however, doesn't make one poor decision of EA. It is obviously that the publisher is having a lot of loses because of piracy. However, EA should understand from a legit buyer's perspective that the toll of piracy should not be migrated to legit buyers, especially with the adoption of a possibly ""made-legal"" spyware securom."
1,Don't treat your customers like you don't want them anywhere near your product.,The DRM system being used in this game is an utter deal breaker and ruins an otherwise solid title by abusing the good faith relationship between a paying customer and publisher.
1,$50 for a game I'm not allowed to own.,"Between my desktop and laptop I would only be able to install Spore onto 1 more configuration before my $50 usage fee is used up. I'm not a fan of renting games, I like to own things I pay good hard earned money for. After doing some more research on the suspicious 3rd party software that ""manages"" my Spore directory (which isn't even truly installed onto my hard drive) I decided to purchase Stardock's DRM free Sins of a Solar Empire instead.I was really looking forward to Spore, but I won't be missing anything special."
1,CANT RESELL,The game is so so I found it fun when I played it but after I got used to it and found myself not playing it anymore I wanted to sell it..I did...now I am going to get low ratings and or put some poor buyer through uneccissary crap because I have to get a return and they dont get to play the game unless i give my EA account username and password. EA should be ashamed. I sould be able to resell a game i buy from them. I will NEVER buy another game from anyone game company that tries to use DRM or this rediculas registeration stunt.....The game itself is fun but playing it will make me madd now!If I ever play it at all again....
1,Will Wright Was Wrong!,"This game is flawed and too dumbed-down. EA, Maxis, and Will Wright laid a rotten egg with Spore. The game is so boring and simplified. The first 2 stages were okay. However, the later stages are just moronic and tedious.In addition, this game is DRM infested. There is something called SecuROM which limits you to 3 installs, ever! That is right...3 install EVER! You are not buying this game, you are only renting with this type of DRM. The customer gets screwed again!Do not support Maxis or EA for screwing gamers over with shallow and uninspiring gameplay and horrible DRM.SPORE is way overhyped!"
1,Spore - Just doesn't keep the interest,"I wanted to like this game. It just simply doesn't work for me. The initial start of the game was interesting and entertaining as you are a single celled creature attempting to advance and develop. Relatively entertaining arcadish game play in trying to avoid other creatures.Once I 'advanced' to a land creature the game just ground to a halt as far as entertainment value is concerned. You basically run to other creatures, hit buttons to 'sing' or 'dance' or 'emote' or 'whatever' and they do the same thing back to you. And you do this again, and again, and again, and again, and....well, you get the idea. It got to the point where I'd rather have a root canal on my molar than keep this up. I gave up, and dropped the game."
1,SecureRom stole my baby and kicked me in the nuts!,"I bought spore, and the game immediately proceeded to kick me repeatedly downstairs. My unborn first born child is also missing.Meanwhile my neighbor pirated the game, and is now enjoying it along with the cheerleading team that came included with the cracked version.Seriously, why does EA punish customers who pay for the game in good faith, while anyone who obtains a pirated version has zero hassle? This makes no sense! Say no to this ridiculous DRM."
1,Ruined by DRM,I've been looking forward to this game for years. Shame it's absolutely crippled by DRM that does nothing to reward people 'buying' it (quote marks because 3 installs is not buying software - it's renting). All the DRM does is give people a reason to download the pirated version.EA = chumps.
2,Overrated,If you don't know by now...This game was a bomb.The most interesting parts came from creating the creatures.You'll find yourself bored to tears wandering around and evolving.Its like 5 mini-games bunched up to make one larger game.Try another SIMs title.
2,Not Fun,THis game is simply NOT FUN. Nuthin fun about it. Its not even fun in a cute graphic way like playin DS Dogs its just crap.
2,Not As Advertised,"Spore... The game that was developed for a decade and promised to revolutionize the way we think of interacting with user generated worlds.It simply does not deliver this experience. While many of the creature and building creation tools are fun and interesting the game play is very lackluster. Most systems are highly repetitive and there is little reward past the creature stage for any well planned evolution of your creature. You're hyper carnivore can easily become a tree-hugging hippie in tribal with no consequences, nor do you have any advantage at combat. The same is true for the reverse situation.Very simply, it feel like the stunning revolution we were promised is a world stunningly empty of content. There is no good AI to creatures you share worlds with, no rich ecosystems develop. It feel like a combination of free internet flash games tied together by innovations in procedural animation techniques.This is simply unfortunate."
1,"Ridiculous, it makes me want to return the game","It is a great game so far, but it is unnecessary to sell us a handicapped product because you are afraid someone is going to hack it. People are going to hack it either way. Don't make everyone pay for it."
1,DRM spoiled a good game!,"Great fun game but my last EA purchase because of DDRM! Dumb DRM...Spore's draconian copy protection...it not only counts installations, but changes to your hardware ! Upgrade a system component (memory, CPU, vid card) and you are out an installation. The way the restrictions are enforced would be described as malware if it wasn't a big name company behind it. Without any notice, it installs software that checks to see what programs are running (you cannot run a virtual CD program and then Spore, even if you have shut down the virtual CD program). This code hides from all the normal ways of listing and shutting down processes, and it's not automatically uninstalled if you uninstall the game, and if you use the instructions given out to uninstall SecuROM, it only partially uninstalls...the reinstalls itself on the next reboot. This should be illegal hacking...maybe it is!!!"
1,DRM FTL,Rediculous DRM makes this game more of a rental than a purchse.I dont pay 50 dollars to rent a game from EA.EA has officially lost a customer for good.
2,Surprisingly unfun.,"DRM issues aside, this game just wasn't that fun. Other reviewers have said it better- I'll just add that I never finished the game, and can't imagine playing it more than once."
1,Worst Game Ever,"Unstable, keeps crashing my PC. I'd blame my PC but hundreds of other games play fine. Even when I get to play it a little, it's boring and uninspired. What a waste of time and money. Plus I'm hearing things about DRM issues. I'm going to try to return it."
1,just found out about rootkit - sending it back,"i preordered this game and it is on its way to me from Amazon. I heard many things about the pre-release version, but none of those reviews said it would come with a rootkit that resided on your system and monitored you. i'm not even breaking the shrinkwrap. in fact, i'm not even opening the amazon carton - oops, i might have to just to make sure it's just spore in there. well, anyway. I'm sending it back, unplayed, uninstalled, unopened. nothing like this is coming anywhere near any system of mine. and as for three reinstalls only - who do these people think they are? do they not understand that people might get viruses sometimes, or a new computer, or something other than be thieves? for god sakes. this really makes me sick. frankly, I don't think a reputable retailer such as Amazon should be associated with this kind of practice."
1,Game going back - No thank you DRM,"My 2 kids were looking forward to buying this game. After reading the tepid reviews I hesitated but finally caved in. I bought the game yesterday from a store but after learning about DRM, I am returning the un-opened box.While I can understand EA's concern about controlling piracy, this is completely the wrong way to go about it. Packing the limited installs, the ""Big Brother watching"", the activation, having ""malware"" software install on my machine, is too much considering that I am paying $50 on top for it!!It was hard explaining this to the kids, but they were familiar with viruses, and they agreed that Dad would be crazy to buy a virus software for $50 - a ""small"" virus in early stages probably but a virus nonetheless."
1,"Thought of buying the game, but with this kind of DRM, definetly not","Well, I thought of buying the game, until I saw all the reviews of the DRM being used. Just what I need on my computer - more useless programs that don't do anything for me. Having had a few bad experience with the ""call to move application to another computer"" type of DRM, I don't by that type of software anymore."
1,EA's Overpriced Rental Service,"The most important thing you need to know about Spore(tm) is that EA has decided you can only install it 3 times, ever, without calling to personally ask their permission. If you ever upgrade your computer, change operating systems, switch to a larger hard drive, have some of your hardware fail, or whatever else may happen, you have just lost one of those installs. If installation hangs midway through, you've lost one of those installs too, so you could be begging on the phone with EA the very day you get the game.If you buy online with EA Download manager, then as an added bonus all reinstallations must be done within 6 months of the original purchase, unless you enjoy paying for your game again. So in that case you can really forget about upgrading your computer entirely.In short, EA wants to rent you their games, but charge full retail price."
1,Just doing my part,"I don't have to go in to great detail why I'm giving a 1 star, since it has been done so 1800 times!"
1,Worst game of the decade,"Spore is one of my biggest regrets ever, complete waste of money. When I finally got past the DRM to register it I found that the game is completely boring, not at all addictive and more like a toy for a toddler than anything else. Hopefully I can unregister the game to offload it onto an auction site before it hits the 5 dollar bargain bin."
1,DRM only punishes the law-abiding,"I've been looking forward to spore for years now. I was all set to spend my hard-earned money. After reading about the anti-consumer practices enacted by EA, I have determined to take my money elsewhere. DRM has one result. The punishing of legitimate users. People of ""quetionable"" morals have no problem circumventing these security measures, and it's only those who want to abide by the law that suffer.Thanks, but no thanks EA, I'm off to play Transport Tycoon (you see, I can still play it even years later)"
1,Another customer lost because of DRM...,"I WAS so excited about the release of this game. I WAS going to buy it. I even recommend the game to all my friends and raved about it. Now that I learned that it is DRM riddled, forget it!!! EA you have just lost another customer with your DRM silliness. I get to keep $50.00 or spend it on something else that I get to keep and not just rent. I will also tell people that they are not buying a game, they are just renting a game for the full price of a game. Satisfied customers will tell one person, angry customers tell ten. Keep that in mind EA."
1,DRM DRM DRM DRM DRM,I may have bought this game if it weren't for EA's absurd DRM schemes. Now I have vowed never to buy Spore or any EA game until this travesty is resolved. This is the cancer killing PC games and there is no arguing this fact.
1,Won't buy it now. Thanks for the warnings.,"I came here to buy Spore and was really surprised to see the 1-star ratings. But I'm glad I did. I've had it with DRM, and because of that I won't be buying Spore."
1,Not A Chance,"I most likely would have purchased this game. Goodness knows I've dropped $50 a couple dozen times over the past year. But always when I drop $50 I am dropping $50 to PURCHASE a game. In no case would I have dropped $50 to RENT a game. This case is no different. And with the triple bonus of ongoing Internet activation and a rootkit to boot? Not a chance. Thanks a lot, EA - I had been looking forward to this game."
1,Saved games wiped out by DRM,Bought this game for my 9 year old son and installed it on his Mac Mini. The game played fine for days then all of a sudden got a license server error. I researched the problem and it was related to the parental controls. After I got the game running again all of his Spore creations were completely gone! Other than that the game play is cool and fun for a young player. I played on his computer for a little while and could not get into it. He loves it and that is all that counts since I bought it for him in the first place.
2,Spore: Disappointment,"When I first discovered that spore was coming out I was so excited. Even the videos I saw on youtube etc demonstrating it looked good. But once I got it, I was at the space phase in a matter of hours! The game is such a great idea but goes way too fast, it appears they cut out a lot of good stuff I saw in the preview videos. You should be able to build the whole planet like sim city. but the cities you create on this game are so dumb you can do nothing with it. Not to mention any building you create is going to look really dumb. And once you get to the space phase it's like a never ending snooze fest. I even bought the creature creator thing before it was released i was so excited. Once I got the game, total disappointment. Don't buy it! Maybe wait until spore 2!!"
2,Dust Collector,The game isnt what i thought it would be. I didnt even make it to space mode. Wish i could have my 40 bucks back.
1,DR duMb,DRM was a bad choice for EA.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.You might as well now download it for free and play it without the DRM
1,Great concept killed by the lawyers,"I, too, have eagerly awaited this game since I first heard about it more than a year ago.However, I will not spend money to purchase any software that tries to device what I may do with my own computer. This game automatically installs SecuROM on your box, and SecuROM won't allow you to install the software more than three times. Beyond that, you need to call EA and ask them to continue to allow you to use the software you've already payed for.Treating paying customers like thieves ensures that this game won't be one of your paying customers. Screw SecuROM, screw DRM, screw EA, and ultimately, screw Spore. Sorry, Will Wright, I'll stick with buying software from companies that don't treat me like a thief."
1,DRM? No thanks.,"Spore is a game I've been looking forward to a while. I've been a fan of the Sim-series games from EA, but the activation scheme required by this game is absolutely draconian, and I will have no part in supporting it. I'll go without, thank you very much."
1,Do not Buy This Game,It's a shame EA has ruined this game with their horrible DRM software that will only allow the game to be installed 3 times before you must contact EA to be able to install the game you rightfully purchased again.
1,Overhyped grand simplistic borefest,"Game was so boring that I only made it to the tribal stage before giving up. This was hyped as the most grand and ambitious game ever made, yet the actual gameplay is really simplistic, not fun, and not intuitive to comprehend. I actually had to read a walkthrough to understand what the heck I am suppose to do to get the silly gestures right in order to advance. Yet despite the boring simplistic gameplay, the overall design feels a lot more annoyingly complicated than it should. No wonder the price for this game has already plummeted. The game just isn't that good."
1,"Read reviews, won't buy.",After seeing much of the hype I was prepared to purchase this title. I waited because I was in the middle of another game. I am very glad I waited. Amazon is a great site to be able to see the reviews and after reading many of them here I will not buy the game. I am really don't like the DRM protection and have never been a big fan of EA. With that in mind I will not purchase this game.
1,Could have been great,"I had high hopes for this game when I read about it a year or so ago. It could have been the next generation of game. Unfortunately the publisher, Electronic Arts, decided to implement a draconian digital rights management scheme. In short you can only rent the game.Perhaps if the consumer speaks loudly enough others will learn that DRM costs more sales than it protects. Do not treat your paying customers as criminals."
1,DRM stops me.,I've been excited about this game for years. I will reconsider when EA reconsiders forcing people to rent uses. Sigh..
1,Does not work with Vista,"Brand new game and it just gives errors about ""not working with vista"". Returned game. Ill buy something that works."
1,ugh,Pretty much uninstallable for me. It seems to have a viral DRM scheme that doesn't play nice with my anti-virus regime. Too bad the game sounds fun but destroying my computer for one game is just not worth it. Give this one a miss.
1,I have never been so excited over a game release.,I have never been so excited over a game release as I was over this one. And I have never been so disappointed at the final product. The absurd digital rights management imposed on this game is insulting. I will not be purchasing this product.
1,Not built to last.,"The games I buy have long shelf lives. I still play games like The Incredible Machine, Loom, Sim City 2000, Civilization II, and Final Fantasy VII (from back when Eidos was distributing it for PC. Remember that!?) on a regular basis. I think Spore has the potential to be that sort of long-lasting game.But I've lost count of the times I've upgraded or replaced my computer since I started playing those older games. What would have happened to them if I had only been able to install them three times!? With a three-install limit, Spore wouldn't last me much more than a year or two much less the decade these other great games have. Sorry, I'm not signing on to a game with a built-in expiration date."
1,It's fun but...,"The game itself is fun. The same sort of fun playing with a retarded kitten is: it'll provide hours of joy, but no real depth to the experience.That, however, is not the point. The point has been made far more eloquently than I care to make my review: The DRM is intolerable. Bug off EA. This is the last game published by EA that I'll buy until two things happen: EA buggers itself with a public apology and compensation to all of its legitimate, paying customers, and it takes the stick out of its rear and stops treating us like thieves."
1,Another person who won't buy this now....,"I refuse to purchase this game, I was looking forward to it, but after reading about the absolute b.s. of the install and the downright MALWARE they install... absolutely no way.Congrats EA on ruining what would have been a great sale. I really hope others don't pay for this."
1,Bad DRM and feels too much like a kid game,"I saw this game coming and I thought this will be cool because I have loved Rome Total War, Age of Empires, and a few other games like that so I thought wow going from microbe to Space would be cool but the first issue was the DRM. I had issues with the game play too as it feels to much like a little kids game.Do not buy this game as you are not buying it as much as you are renting it from EA. Could be fun game if cost was $30 or $40 and the DRM was gone or at least paired back a lot. EA has killed the game and Wil Wright you should be mad at EA for doing this to a game that could have done so well.I also bought Spore for the iPhone and I have to say it is an ok game but needs a lot of work. Way to much crashing. After 1 hour of playing the game on the iPhone it crashed like 4 times back to the home screen."
1,DRM'd,"When I finally installed this game, and my hard-drive crashed. Now I have used up two installs, and I have already received a message saying that I did not have the correct disc in the drive (a reboot fixed this).Very disappointing; DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
1,Would have been great if it was not published through EA,"I have been dealing with EA support for the last few weeks because I bought battlefield and due to the DRM it does not work. They keep sending me cookie-cutter type solutions that don't work and don't address the issue. It has been such a ridiculous experience there is absolutely no way i will buy anything from EA again, no matter how great the game is. I really want to support game developers by paying for games, they definitely deserve it, but if they keep publishing through EA I will have to resort to piracy. Not a threat, just a sad fact."
1,Not Buying Now!!!,"I have been very excited for this release. It has been my most anticipated game the past few years. However, since finding out about the DRM requirements, I have decided not to buy. Thanks to all the other comments bringing this issue to light."
1,I heard some things,SoI herd sum thingsI herd you like DRMudkipzMost people have said it better. SecuROM and the DRM are pointless.They already had a great way to protect the game by making it only 1 customer account linked per CD key. Since the biggest part of Spore is the online content that should be enough to get people to buy it.Having to add in DRMudkipz as well just hurts the consumer. I'm going to go play with non retarded kipz now kthx bai.
1,DRM. Dead Recent Memory,"I was really looking forward to playing this game. Heck I was gonna go buy it on day one. So what's the reason why my title says ""Dead Recent Memory"". Simple, my memory's of this game will fade like the trust EA has with it's consumers. If they can't trust me, why should I trust them?"
1,This game is a virus,"Don't buy this game, when you install it, it installs spyware on your computer without your consent."
1,Shockingly Sad because of DRM system,"I have had some recent incidents with EA, with some other software.One just has to wonder what goes on between the ears of the Executive Management idiots, who look at their customers as thieves as well as look to make a few extra dollars in the hope that the media will get damaged.It takes a thief to think everyone else is a thief.SPORE has been destroyed by EA executive management, with their draconian DRM system. It showed so much, great promise early on, then was destroyed when released.Don't purchase any software with those idiotic, DRM viruses that get inserted into software and let the vendor, (EA), know about it.Jon"
1,One Word: Disapointing,"I really can't believe how bad they messed this up. Enough people say it well enough on here, so that I don't have to repeat it more then to say: Its a shallow game that gets old within days, and the DRM is... well, it just brings the kind of words I'd rather not say on here to mind. This is the first game I've wanted to download an illegal copy of. Call it civil disobedience. I'm not a thief, and don't like being treated as such."
1,Requires Internet Connection,"This game requires an internet connection to play. Unfortunately, my computer doesn't have one. Another $50 coaster.When I start the game, a window pops up and it says, 'The game cannot start. The game needs access to the internet to verify ownership of this game. Please ensure that your computer is online and try again.'"
1,God damn DRM,"I have a computer that haad to be reinstalled a couple of times this week, because of some family members that are to curious. Hence, I cannot play this game anymore after installing it 3 times. Had I know, I wouldnt bought it .."
1,DRM,"This game contains DRM that controls what you can do with it even after you buy it. This restriction is mentioned no where on the box and once opened it can't be returned. This is a monumental scam. Moreover, the DRM software runs *forever* in the background of your computer slowing down your system. Beyond that, if EA ever decided to shut down the activation servers you would never be able to access the game again.Don't buy this game!!"
1,"Mac version performs terribly, Insane DRM","The concept is great and all, but the delivery sucks.First of all, this isn't even a real Mac title. Sadly for Mac users, all of the games that EA releases for the Mac are ""emulated"" by Cider, a hyped up port of Wine to Darwin/OS X. This translates into EXTREMELY POOR performance on even decent Macs. I own a Macbook Pro 2.16 Dual Core with 2GB of RAM and the Radeon X1600 - and I simply could not play the tribal stage because of the terrible frame rate. Mac users are better off installing Windows on Boot Camp and then playing the game.Secondly, and more importantly, no more than 3 installations! DRM is proven to be harmful to both software and users - so why the hell would they make such a move? Congratulations Spore, you just won the title of the most pirated game ever - kind of contrary to what DRM is supposed to stop, isn't it? Well, you deserve it.Don't waste your time with this, there's plenty of other great stuff on Amazon worth your $50."
1,We should have got Sim City 5 instead,"Life is tough for Will Wright. After coming out with The Sims he seems to have painted himself into a corner with his new release, ""Spore"". The game is novel at first and most of the fun to be had is found in the editor portions of the game. However, beyond that the game is too simplified and I feel that it doesn't have enough replay value. The final space stage is tedious. You never get more than 1 ship and there are constant disasters at your home world. Combat is really hard as well. The real problem with Spore is they had to put 5 scaled-down games in there, so no one part of the game really shines. I've been a fan of Maxis since the original Sim City, so I wanted to like this game. Sadly, I can't give a good recommendation. The whole DRM situation and vice-like grip that EA now has on the title is another downside. I would say, stay away from this one. Sim City 4 is much better. It's years after release and I'm still playing it."
1,Reinstalled windows a few times now I can't install it,"I reinstalled windows a few times while having trouble with some hardware issues. After everything was working, I tried installing this game and was told that I have already installed it on too many computers and would never be able to install it again! This game has the worst and most strict copyright protection I have ever seen and I have already returned it to the store - after arguing with the manager for over 3 hours who normally doesn't take returns on opened software but saw my point."
1,I cannot believe the TERRIBLE DRM!,"Limiting this game to 3 installs is the most stupid move a company could make. Of course, EA has shown how they value their customers. If you build your own systems, or ever plan on upgrading to a new machine, AVOID games by EA.It is too bad Maxis could not have partnered with a decent distributor, instead of EA... I will be returning my copy of Spore that I pre-ordered ages ago. I had no idea it would come with such a ridiculous restrictive license!"
1,Too bad it has DRM,"I was excited for this game, but I will not buy it due to the DRM that only lets you install the game so many times. Same reason I did not buy Bioshock, even though I was excited for that game because I loved the System Shock games.Why do they even need DRM when you connect to them to download items in the universe for your game. Seems like a CD key would have been plenty protection enough.I stopped buying music CDs because of DRM that made it so you couldn't play the CD in all devices. I guess I'm not going to be buying any EA games until they change this practice as well. THIS ONLY HURTS THE PEOPLE WHO PAY FOR THE GAME! It will still get pirated and then the people who steal the game will have no DRM. Just as what happened with music. It's pointless and stupid, and only helps to destroy the PC gaming market!!!!!"
1,The hype was too great.,"Spore was supposed to bring something new to the table, however it just fell into the crowd. The gameplay gets old pretty quickly and the monsters are okay at best. 3 installs??? That is ridiculous, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone."
1,DRM is a game changer,"Before finding out about the DRM problem, my decision was whether to get the regular or special edition of the game. I am so sad to find out what EA did with this game. Not only will I not buy this game, but I will do my best to avoid all EA games.I find that I am hanging on to early editions of software that work fine and don't require online service or verifications. When will these companies get wise?"
1,DRM,Please see posts above and below.How many times do we have to tell you people (manufacturers). Stop punishing LEGIT customers.
1,Great game but...,"EA seems to love this archaic DRM system, and if they can't toss a DRM on it then they tend to ship a unfinished game and finish it a month later(if you're lucky) with a patch. EA has lost all credibility."
1,DRM = Digital Right Mismanagement,"The concept of this game is fantastic! The publisher of this game has a screw loose!EA's insistence on punishing a paying customer to play their game is unnecessary and arrogant. While the hype for Spore has been incredible, and hence the percent of pirated copies that statistically will occur will result in large numbers and losses, a DRM the likes of SecureROM discourages paying customers more that it deters pirates. No matter how secure the DRM, there will be ways around it. The fact that EA thinks slapping this terrible DRM onto a popular game will go unnoticed is arrogant and stupid.Case and Point = Galactic Civilizations 2.... no copy protection whatsoever... record sales for it's genre..."
1,DRM? Way to ruin a great game.,"I was so hyped about this game, and all the demo's looked so good. I refuse to buy a game with DRM. I'm not a thief and shouldn't be treated like one simply because I want to actually buy EA's product. I'll wait until a patch removes the DRM. I hope EA doesn't wreck Warhammer as well."
1,"Enjoyed for a few days, then DRM ruined it","I purchased Spore, and after installing on two separate Windows partitions then being forced to wipe them due to a virus, I unfortunately found that the horrible DRM restrictions on the disc would not allow me to install the game again. Money out the window because EA doesn't understand that people prefer to purchase a product, not a draconian version of a contract that allows you to use it temporarily."
1,"One down, two to go","Bought it. Installed it. The game told me only afterwards that my video card wasn't up to snuff, sorry, can't play. Among the many indignities they subjected their customers to when they decided to go with this three-install-limit security scheme, they couldn't take a few hours to have the game test system specs during installation?So now I have a choice: either buy a better video card, or let one of my three installations go to waste. I'll give you a hint: it's not going to be the first one. I spent too much money on Spore the second I hit ""confirm"" on my amazon order."
1,Copy Protection??? Are you kidding???,"You have GOT to be kidding??? I get to rent this game through 2 upgrades to my system? I just returned it back to the store. Forget that... If they want my money, sell me something with unlimited installations, like in the good old days. I regularly upgrade and trash my pc. Save your money and buy something else."
1,Lost Sale,"I had planned to install my copy on both my Mac and PC and play with my kids. Thats 2/3s of my allowable installs as soon as I open the package. No thanks, I'll pass altogether."
1,DRM my ***,"If you want to have lots of ""fun"" with DRM - go ahead and buy it.If you rather preffer to play and don't worry about it - download it."
1,I concur - DRM invalidates this purchase,"...my wife pre-ordered this for me because she knew how excited I was about the game. Just now heard about the SecuROM DRM infection though - which invalidates this as a legitimate purchase.DRM does not stop piracy. Doesn't slow them down. It does however destroy the rights of honest consumers, like me, who now no longer wants a game that was salivated over for years because the DRM infection will make the game disk worthless to me probably in a matter of months.Because of this, piracy is the better option for all. If you want to stop the DRM infection, but don't want to be a pirate, refuse to purchase this game and let it be known that the DRM is why you aren't buying it."
1,DRM disappoints,"I was looking forward to playing the latest product by Will Wright. Yet, I am not going to buy a game with draconian DRM. It's too bad."
1,Great Game! Horrible DRM!,"This is a great game. My kids, 6 and 9, love playing it.(...)Get SPORE for the game play. But be prepared to only play it offline."
1,I was so excited to get Spore.....,....until I found out from everyone that it has DRM. Why!? What if I want to share this game with my wife and have it installed on more than one of my computers. Not to mention the fact that I plan on upgrading computers soon and one or more of my DRM usages would have already been previously used. I will NOT purchase this game until DRM is removed. I don't see how this prevents piracy. This just makes me want to pirate it more when I was already planning on buying it legally.
1,Flashback to The Ewok Adventure,"I have to quote the all knowing, all mighty, and eternal Wicket, ""Star Cruiser Crash Crash."" Every time I leave the homeworld on my spaceship, I Crash Crash! Apparently thousands of others are having the same problem as proven by the evidence littered throughout boards and blogs on the web. Terrible job programming an already thinned out and marginalized game. Mass Effect 2 is the last chance EA ever has to get my money. If they manage to mess that one up, they are done forever in my book."
1,Don't Buy This,"If you were planning on buying SPORE, DON'T! This game is only mildly entertaining. The most horrible stages of all are the creature stage where you run around repeating monotonous actions over and over again. The tribal stage sucks even more, I found it confusing and the actions of my tribesman sluggish. The worst part of this game is its Digital Rights Management. You can only install it 3 times before asking for another ""license"". Apparently this license doesn't matter because I know thousands of people have already downloaded it illegally, leaving all the legit people who actually bought it (AKA me) feeling stupid. Don't buy this game or you will be disappointed after 4 hours."
1,Very Disappointed,I went out and bought this game the day it came out. I later discovered the horrendous DRM. I am very disappointed and I will not be purchasing other EA products in the future.
1,"Hyped it, Waited for it, Played it, HATED it.","As a college student, $50 dollars isn't the easiest to come across, but boy did the media hype this game up. So I go an buy it, and wow I was awfully disappointed. After going through the awful, most terrible experiences one has ever had to go through with DRM. Next is the hyped up game quality. Now, I have no time to rant, so I'll be as quick as the game's playability is. Easy, Pointless, Annoying, and oh God the DRM!!!"
1,Why are customers being treated like criminals?,"For one reason or another, EA hasn't learned from its mistakes in the past. I fully intended to buy this game but was disappointed to learn that it was laden with restrictive DRM. Where's my motivation to buy the game when it is in fact simpler to download the game (sans DRM) ""illegally""? Why are the real customers the ones being treated like criminals?"
1,Bad DRM and crash after marathon gaming,"Play this game for more than 3-4 hours, and you crash. If you'r lucky, you remembered to save 2 hours before the crash, so there's only 2 hours lost. ADD AUTOSAVE PLEASE BECAUSE IT CRASHES ALL THE TIME.DRM is a joke EA! You only hurt yourself doing this!!!!!!!WE WON'T RENT GAMES EA!WE WON'T RENT GAMES EA!WE WON'T RENT GAMES EA!"
1,Looks like a great game execpt for the DRM..,"What a lot of people said. The gameplay looks fun, and the graphics are spectacular.. but I'm not a fan of being treated like a criminal just to play their silly game. Imagine if you bought a house and the bank installed a rent-a-cop to follow you around to make sure you paid the mortgage.Just icky feeling all around.. I'd avoid this game at all costs until Electronic Arts removes the draconian DRM. The pirates don't use it, why should I pay for it and be saddled with their spyware/DRM?"
1,Installing on vista & DRM,"I installed this game on Vista and it didn't install a single shortcut to start the game up. I have to hunt through the program files for a .exe to make it start up- even the autoplay won't work! it does feel like a lot of mini-games loosely connected, where dying doesn't seem to have any effect- where's the challenge?The DRM is simply ridiculous, hence the one star rating. I shouldn't have to grovel to a company to reinstall it in the future when I've already paid good money for it. EA need to seriously listen to their customer base, because if people feel ripped off they will turn to piracy- let the collapsing music industry be a cautionary tale to them!"
1,A little great game,"The game is great, i've bought the gallactic ed. months before the release, the expectation was very high, and then... DRM :/EA massive drm on new games are jeopardizing the whole gamming scene, I don't like to have a program that I'm unaware of it's purpose watching my pc and I don't like either to have only three chances of install, I Bought it, so it's mine now."
1,I Upgrade Often This is Unacceptable,"Screw this, if I play this game I'll just download it off a torrent. So you know I've never downloaded a game off a torrent. I've always believed in buying, but this has gone to far. I'll probably just not get the game at all. I am really disappointed."
1,I would really like to try this game if it wasn't for the DRM,Just got a new computer and itching for some new games. Why did you have to go and screw this one up EA?
1,STOPS WORKING in about two years time. :-(,"So I get three installs.That's not so bad.Until you consider that I upgrade my computer every year, so I'll have used all three of my installs in just 2-3 years time!!! Bah. Humbug! I'll just wait for the PS3 or Wii version, which won't have that ridiculous limitation. And if it's never released on console? Oh well.I'm not throwing away three hours of wages on a ticking game with a built-in expiration.PASS."
1,"Fun game, not worth DRM Restrictions","This is an awesome game, I had the pleasure of playing it @ a friend's house. Sadly its a game I will probably not buy. I just can't see myself dropping $[...] for a game thats going to limit me how many times I will be able to install on my PC. I occasionally do OS reinstalls on my PC, and the fact that after a while my game will not work, I just can't take that risk. Oh well, maybe they'll wise up and take off the DRM, or maybe I can buy it years from now when the price drops to like $[...] bucks or less."
1,DRM is aweful!,The DRM totally ruined this game. Do not attempt to charge customers money for something that they are not allowed to own. The future of merchandise does not have room for companies that restrict the freedom of their customers.
1,Very sad,I will never buy a game that uses securom. I will not buy a game that is going to limit the amount of times I can install to 3. That is simply ridiculous.I was very very excited about this game but because of EA's decision to use a horribly invasive DRM system they will not get my money for this game.
1,SecuROM?!?,"That's like if I invited you into my house and you put locks on all my bedroom doors. Way to be paranoid and overreact, EA."
1,DRM FTW!!!!,"Jumping on the 1 star bandwagon to show my dislike of the DRM on this game. Lets be honest, the gameplay is nothing special either. My overall review is somewhere between ""meh"" and ""eh""."
1,"Love the Developers, Hate the Distributors","I've been anticipating this game from its inception 6 years ago. I've been following the blog, watching videos, and listening to speeches the head creator has given waiting for this ""evolutionary"" game.After getting it from Best Buy the day it came out, I was totally taken back at this game's DRM. There was no mention of it anywhere on the net prior to release, or if there was, I was unaware. It's sad that EA has gone to such great lengths to impose restrictions on the game, instead of focusing their powers on increasing the user experience, or promoting it. What everyone has said regarding the DRM is true. Even if they offer a removal software device in the future, because it has caused such a miserable backlash, it is still us an undue burden that lies with the consumer. EA really botched this one."
1,Full price for a rental,If you would like to pay full retail price for a product only to find out its actually a rental at a ridiculous price limited to 3 installs only before your penalised and unable to play the game whilst pirates of the game dont have to worry about this then this game is for you.It is a good game overall however a lot of the stuff we were told was in the game has been removed and added on top of that the 3 limit install really lets it down big style
1,JUST SAY NO TO DRM,I really wanted to like this game but after reading about the DRM I think not.. I hope these things sit on the shelf and become nothing but wasted coasters for EA.. Shame on them for treating customers like thieves.
1,DRM is the killing factor,"Like so many others, I refuse to rent a video game. To all you other reviewers, right on! It's good to know that the world won't sit quietly in the corner and let big EA take its lunch money.EA, remove the DRM on your game and I will purchase it to support your decision, if nothing else."
1,waste of money,The game was really cool up until you start traveling space. After that it was pretty much Age Of Empires with crappy graphics. Once you get into space the game gets really boring.
4,Fun for all ages,"My older son bought this for his younger brother as a birthday gift. I allow very few computer games and this was the one way he could sneak it by me :) I like that they make choices and see the results. They all hug the screen and want to watch what the other is doing, almost a group activity. I don't know that I would buy it for my kids but they LOVE it and I haven't found anything bloody or violent or disgusting. I gave it a 4 since it's not an ""excellent"" learning game. It is an interesting view of evolution and I have talked to my kids about that world view and explained real life versus a game. If you have a big problem with evolution I wouldn't recommend this particular game but it makes for a fun activity during our winter blizzards."
3,Pretty Cool,"This game could have been SO MUCH MORE. It gets pretty repetitive. Overall, it's a fun game to play for a few hours but does not have lasting appeal. The free demo is more fun than the $50 game.By the way...I have no idea what everyone is talking about with DRM. I have a 5-7 year old Dell desktop & this game works pretty well on it. The DRM is not slowing down my computer & I only have 512MB ram. I did a lot of research on DRM before I bought the game & it seems harmless. People are majorly overreacting."
1,SecuROM DRM Ruined This Game For Me!,"After reading all the reviews, it sounds like SPORE would have been a fun a game as the description really attracts me but I also hear you need to have an Internet Connection to play the game to register its DRM system. Here is something some people probably don't think about...we buy a game to have for a long time, what happens when the registration servers shutdown years from now? Answer: You have a game you may not be able play any longer or maybe you will need to download a patch to override the DRM! I still play a lot of my classic games from time to time that are DRM free, this game may be unplayable in years! Looks like this company lost a customer for life!"
1,Not buying yet,"I'm not buying this game until the DRM copy protection is removed. I have played it on a freinds computer and would like to buy it. I do not pirate games, I have never downloaded one online. I cannot understand though how EA punishes people like me who actually PAY for their games by making it inconvenient to enjoy the game for years with this scheme.I will buy the Sims3 when it comes out (supposedly won't have this copy protection). I WOULD buy Spore and Red Alert 3, but only if they remove this overly aggressive copy protection."
1,Spore won't install load,"Got it as a Christmas Present, but the disk isn't even recognized by my WinXP PC much less load and run! Ran out and got another copy at a local store, and it has the same malfunction. My drive is new and all other games loaded well. DONT BUY SPORE till this gets fixed!"
1,SecuROM - never again!,"This was the first and will be the LAST SecuROM product I'll ever buy.The game starts off good enough, but eventually just becomes tedious and pointless.Giving it to the local thrift shop while there's still an activation or two left. I'll include a note that the DRM stuff will soon make it worthless. Might be worth paying a buck for."
1,Had Fun but...,OK. I got this game and downloaded it straight away and started to play.Even though I Had the Min requirements It was really slow and freezed up a lot but amazingly all I had to do was hit control alt delete and it would work again. But that wasn't the problem. The problem was that when I did the migrating thing in the game it CRASHED my computer. Then I went to the store and return it but this time it wouldn't even start. I traded it in again and the same migrating thing as before so I returned it back for my money.It was fun for the time I got to play but It was so problematic that Will Wright has gone right down the toilet in credibility.
1,The DRM is ridiculous,"This game is fun, especially if you are into designing things. If you aren't really into creating things and are looking for a hardcore gamer experience, this isn't for you. I am a pretty hardcore gamer, but I think this game is fun, but again I mostly have fun with creating elements, the actual ""game"" itself isn't particularly deep.However the DRM is absolutely ridiculous. I payed for this game, so why am I being treated like a software pirate? Technically I am just ""renting"" the game I own, for use only when I have an internet connection, and only as long as I haven't installed it more than 3 times..."
1,Another sale lost....,"I mean really, why spend fifty bucks to be treated like a criminal, when you can easily net a copy that's had the DRM hacked out of it, and be treated like a legal purchaser, free?I can't believe EA would sink this low. Why would you offer solid titles with this kind of gimping? Blizzard will keep getting my 15 bucks a month for WoW until this little issue gets resolved."
1,i don't want to be treated like criminal,"I usually buy used games to save money, but was going to buy Spore right away. I downloaded the Creature Creator and loved it, but there's no way I'm buying this game with DRM that treats me like a criminal, and installs a root kit on my computer. EA, you can keep your game, and I'll keep my money."
1,Not with DRM for me,"This is a show stopper for me. I tend to build my computers incrementally, including changing out parts that will cause the Spore DRM to stop my game from functioning fairly quickly. In addition having the DRM running on my system when I don't want it to is unacceptable.I hope the remove the DRM in a future release so I can buy the game."
1,Ridiculous DRM is the killer,"No matter how much fun the game might be, a three installation limit is a big no-go for me. I could possibly live with the activation, assuming it was reliable, but I will never purchase a game that can only be installed three times. And calling some EA outsourced flunky to convince them to let me install it beyond the 3-install limit doesn't cut it either.All these 1 star reviews can't be wrong, and they are not. Most DRM is livable; EA has exceeded the threshold and the shareholders deserve to suffer for it."
1,no drm,"SecuROM DRM is a deal breaker for me. If I purchase this game, why should I be subject to proving that I own it every 5-10 days?What happens in 5 years when the key verification server is shut down because of some merger?"
2,Great game but the DRM soft is a bad choice!,"Well, I knew, the issues with the Securerom drm already when I bought. But I went the trouble of running on standalone clean pc, that I imaged before to be clean out of the box install. Still it did cause hick ups.EA, this more than a no go, since zou can not remove the DRM when you remove the game. It stays for good and that is illegal.The game itself is a lot of. It is so much fun to play and I am enjoying. Lovely graphics, great story and idea, including on my iphone :-)It is a hard decision if one should buy it or not. If you only have one pc don't! Now, I remember why this is the first PC game I bought in 5 years."
1,sigh....,After waiting for countless months for this game I was shocked to see that it has the most extreme form of DRM I've ever heard of. It's too bad that such a seller concept was ruined by unnecessary DRM.
1,Great Potential but DRM and Shallow gameplay kill it,"This game has so much potential it really makes me want to cry. Great Premise, but the execution is a little flawed, I think once a expansion or two(or games to follow in it's footsteps) will make it great and I am looking forward to them.The DRM on this game is horrendous though, as a rather nostalgic person I often enjoy going back to older games, installing them and enjoying them for a 2nd round. With Spore I will not be able to do that due to the 3 install limit EA has set on us, why am I restricted to installs on a product I paid for? Pretty sad that I'm treated like a criminal even though I'm their customer, I was stupid and preordered before I heard about the DRM...stupid me.One thing is for sure I will not be purchasing any of those expansion packs unless they don't include DRM and remove the DRM from the original game with a patch."
1,DRM === NO WAY === WARNING === DO NOT BUY,Do NOT buy this game -- SEND EA a message -- it uses DRM == YOU DO NOT OWN THE GAME == IT IS EQAUL TO RENTING IT!! (for $50!@#!) AVOID AVOID
1,This DRM is a bad trend,"While I think this is a fun game, the DRM means you only have a limited amount of time to play it before your disk doesn't work anymore.Thus, all these 1 star ratings are well justified. Hopefully EA will wake up to this eventually."
1,"DRM complicates life, removes value","In the past 3 months, my computer has had a new operating system installed 5 times. Occasionally due to hardware upgrades, occasionally due to hardware failures, and occasionally because I wanted to try something different.I have been waiting for Spore with baited breath for years now, and greatly enjoyed watching it develop. However, if current trends continue (which they probably will), I will be calling and pleading for EA to let me reinstall the game I purchased. If this game has the staying power I expect it to, I could very well be calling EA again in 5 years time. If I can find the number, and if it still exists.The complications of DRM do nothing to deter piracy, and merely complicate the lives of those legally purchasing the game."
1,DRM a show stopper,"I had the Spore release date marked on my calendar long ago. When the day arrived, I excitedly came to Amazon, eager to get my hands on this highly anticipated game.And then I saw the reviews. I will not be acquiring Spore until/unless EA stops treating its customers like criminals who need invasive Big Brotherware installed on their machines. I haven't bought a single Sony product since the rootkit debacle. Now I get to add my favorite game maker to the list of companies I will not patronize unless they radically change their manner of doing business.Thank you to all the reviewers who prevented me from making the mistake of buying Spore."
1,Thinking about purchasing this,"Well I've been looking forward to this game for a while now having played basically every Sim game from back in the day. But reading these reviews and seeing the problems people are having I don't think that I will be purchasing it for now, at least until they fix these DRM issues. Sad because I really like to support genuinely good games. Nobody is going to buy this if there are cracked versions already online."
1,DRM - BEEN SO EXCITED FOR THIS GAME FOR SUCH A DISAPOINTMENT FROM EA,Until DRM is removed... I will not buy or even consider. I will wait till EA quits being greedy.
1,Awful DRM and uninspiring gameplay,"The DRM component is simply outdated and draconian, and after the hassle of activation the gameplay simply wasn't worth it.Avoid."
1,drmmmmmmmmm,"Don't treat paying customers like pirates. I cannot in good conscience buy this game now, EA has tainted it with this unholy drm. I would rather pirate it and hand the creator 50 bucks, or 10 cents, however much he gets per copy sold."
1,terrible,"if you want to be totally ripped off then buy this game. The disgusting DRM issues should be enough to put you off from buying this game, not to mention the many many release bugs in the game. You can see this game was rushed towards the release date with functions being cut from final release which Im sure will be given as future expansions so even more money to shell out, for what you should have had in first release."
1,DRM is a show stopper.,"hmmm... One of the most highly anticipated games of 2008 is being released it's time to see when it's going to pop up on Steam...Wait, it's not on Steam?OMG EA? Really EA?Please don't buy this game until the DRM is removed, or else your just validating the existence of useless, archaic DRM."
1,Not worth the wait,"I waited half a decade for this? Go back and watch the 2005 spore videos to see what the game could have and should have been. Its been reduced to a collection of mini games, and frankly the tribal mini game stage is terrible. Furthermore creature creation has been nerfed to where its stylistic as opposed to utilitarian.Oh and the DRM was the final straw. Lost Two stars for that one."
1,I will wait. I hope you will too!,"I have been looking forward to the release of Spore for years now. Since I discovered EA has implemented DRM on this game, I refuse to buy it. I hope that EA will realize the mistake they made and rethink their actions for future releases. I cannot buy DRM software because I regularly format my HDD because of work and school.Please don't fall for EA's greed. If we pay for a game, we should be use it however we want to and reinstall it as many times as we would like."
2,"Boring game, little replay value.","The creature creator is a lot of fun. The sludge/creature stages are interesting, though the creature combat gets tiresome and the control scheme is terrible.At the tribal stage the game basically takes an enjoyment nosedive.Given that it takes ~ a few hours max to get to this point the game is pretty bad value for money. You can create more creatures but it's basically the same slog.You could do better for $49.99, no doubt about it."
1,I can do without the DRM please.,It's sad to see a great game suffering because the distributor includes DRM which punishes the people who buy the game.
1,"Spore - Innovative Leap, Tripped in Implementation","What had all the makings of an evolutionary, if not revolutionary, game was pooched for the following reasons:- Limited interaction between visible traits and numbers (determinations made by numerical analysis, not taking benefit of user created physical traits into consideration)- DRM : game will cease to function for me in the near future after moderate hardware changes, requiring hours of hold time to get something I bought to work. Sort of like an exploding letter or ink that disappears. Much more akin to a rental for the price of a full purchase."
2,Don't waste your money all the hype didn't deliver,I guess I did not read the DRM fine print; I would have never purchased it if I knew I was renting it. I was very excited for this game to come out. After about 2 hours of playing it I found it to be very boring. The creation part is pretty cool but the actual game play is lacking. I got my spore up to 'civilization' and probably won't go any further.
1,DRM,"Terrible DRM scheme, and $5 extra for their download service for ONE YEAR? EA must be joking. You're paying $55 to be able to install the game three times. Most gamers replace or upgrade their PCs frequently. Why buy a game which you can't play after two upgrades?"
1,Do NOT load DRM and Hidden Software on your PC,"This ""game"" loads a program that keeps track of what you do with your own computer. It has nothing to do with gaming and the pirates will still have their nice clean copies. No way, don't do it. Don't support this treatment of good, honest gamers. I used to love PC gaming and this just makes me sick because I would have normally bought this games. Sad. Very sad."
1,EA owns my computer?,"I was going to buy this game until reading the reviews here, and I absolutely must echo what has been said thus far.EA has the right to protect their product, but consumers have the right to use their systems. If I have a game that I can only install three times, that limits what I can do with my computer. If I want to reinstall my OS, or install a new OS (eg ""upgrade"" XP to Vista), I now have to consider that I will be burning up one of my Spore installations.What gives EA the right to penalize me $50 for what I choose to do with MY computer?"
5,Tristan Sinclair,My son ordered this with my permission... he says it is the best game ever. He tries to get me to play it with him. It is rather interesting.Mrs. Sinclair
1,DRM ruins a AAA title,Read carefully what all the other reviewers are saying about the DRM of this title! The only way to stop publishers from forcing this DRM on the consumer is to not buy the products. Do not buy this game until the DRM is removed.
1,thx for crashing my PC,"After installing Spore i needed to remove the trojaner that were inserted into my PC, it unfortunately resulted in crashing my computer and a full days work at reinstalling everything was needed. I am now wery sceptically to EA and will not install anything that is newer than 1,5 year from them..."
1,Biggest let down of 2008.,"This game was a big let down. I read about it years ago and have waited for it, Well.. fun concept, but it gets boring, even my kids think it felt like it was missing something. I don't recommend this game. I can't install it on more than 3 computers unless I call EA, I think this a joke.Why do you keep digging yourself in a hole EA? You did it on this one."
1,Draconian DRM,"Buyer beware. If you uninstall/reinstall this game more than 3 times, it will no longer work. If the servers required to authenticate the game go away, because the company goes out of business or because the company no longer supports the product, then the game will no longer work. You will be forced to resort to piracy in order to play a game that you paid for.Bad business, in my opinion."
1,"Was Going to Buy It, But Not Anymore",I was shocked when I read the news about the stupid DRM restrictions for this game. This kinda makes it the George Bush of computer games. It has no place on my hard drive!
1,HUH?,"Does EA seriously think that it is okay to limit the number of computers that my copy of the game can be installed. I have two computers, I installed it on both to see which one runs better and now I only have one more move left before I have to ""plead my case"". I wish I knew this before hand.Otherwise, the game is interesting and I like the various stages of life. However, I feel like the game play still resembles the other ""progress through history"" games.I still cant get past the ""anti-piracy"" thing and think the EA folks should have been more creative in achieving their goal. In my opinion that pushes this game down to a onestar rating."
4,A review from an actual player.,"SPORE is an excellent addition to the simulation genera. Although it's a single player game, it does require an internet connection for the best effect. The game will populate your world/galaxy with other user's creatures pulled off the spore servers.The only con I found with this is that it's completely random, and some people are perverts. My first play through had 2 ""penis"" creatures running around. Although you can go into your sporepedia and delete them.I've run the game under vista64 and XP(Dual Boot) and have found it fairly stable. I've had it crash once in the week I've had it.All in all, it's a fun game and will take a lot of your time. If your a hard core gamer, this is not much of a challenge to play. It is SIM'ish in that anyone should be able to play it easily."
3,Fun Game killed by DRM,"I wanted to get Spore ever since it was announced by EA, and every time the release date was pushed back I got more disappointed. By the time it came out, the expectations were so high that it fell short. The gameplay, while fun, requires a lot of time where you just sit there and design stuff. Designing buildings was the most tedious for me. Luckily, being able to pull things from the Sporepedia helps this process along. The space stage, easily the most fun part of the game, gets overwhelming with the number of missions and requests for aid/protection. It also gets repetitive after a while.This product would get a 4 overall if there wasn't DRM. DRM kills games, songs, basically anything that it touches."
3,Customization is the new part here,"Everything except the amount of character customization has been done. I felt like I was playing a tutorial, and the the GUI was unimpressive. Let me rephrase that; the GUI was a slightly altered copy of Blizzard's older games, like StarCraft. It's a great system but I didn't feel like spore was actually offering anything new. It's a fun game but as an adult who likes strategy games, not very stimulating."
1,"Bought the game, wondering how long I can play it....","I recently bought the game. But because I like to tinker with my computer a lot I often reinstall windows. This is a common thing to do and this is what they do at GeekSquad if you have a serious compouter problem.I just found out that if I re-install windows on this computer, THE SAME COMPUTER, NOT DIFFERENT COMPUTERS, that spore will stop working after three times. So since I re-install windows at least once every 2 months, I have effectively paid 50 dollars to RENT this game for six months.I still play the Sims 2 and all its expansion packs after many years, and over 7 re-installs of windows xp. But with this game I will be cut off from the product I purchased after 6 months.DO not purchase this game unless you are sure that you will not need to reinstall windows due to a virus or hardware upgrade or even upgrading from xp to vista. It will be rendered unusable."
3,"Fun, but not without issues","The following things are clear:-Every stage except for Space is underdeveloped and too simplistic to probably make room for add-ons (The Sims, anyone?).-Evolution doesn't matter so much as statistics and is more aesthetic than functional.-Had I paid attention to the DRM issue, I would not have purchased the game. Down the road, I'll be out $50 and will have to deal with EA's notoriously horrible ""customer service"" department.Overall: Entertaining, but a victim of terrible corporate decisions."
1,"Sorry EA, no sale.","I have looked forward to this game since it was announced. My son and I discussed how very cool it was. What a concept. I even bought Creature Creator, when it was released in anticipation of the game's release. I really wanted to buy this game and my son did too. Sorry, EA, I refuse to lease this game for fifty bucks. My son and I were both born, however it wasn't yesterday. I think this move has cost EA more sales than would ever have lost to pirates. I don't steal DVDs, music or games, as my purchase history with Amazon will attest. I will NOT lease this game.Terry"
1,The dregs of PC gaming,"I consider Securerom DRM and DRM in general is as low or lower than pedophiles, drug dealers, and telephone solicitors.I went through this B.S. with Bioshock's SecureRom DRM after three installs. I found a crack/workaround on the web and vowed never to buy DRM protected software again."
1,I never played the game,"I haven't played this game, but seeing as everyone is giving it a 1 star review because of the DRM, I figured I'd jump on the Let's Bash Spore and EA bandwagon while it still didn't leave town. So yea, down with DRM!"
1,JUST SAY NO TO DRM,"good games will sell, look at sins of a solar empire, your just hurting the people that buy your game. wtf!"
3,"Quite good, minus the DRM","I bought this game taking the advice of an old roommate. It's actually quite good, with the DRM aside. It's very dynamic and creative, something I haven't seen in a computer game for a long time.I can't instantly classify it (shooter, RPG, adventure game) like most computer games can be these days, and I like that in a game.Concerning the well known DRM scheme, I believe that some sort of DRM is neccessary on a primarily single player game is necessary to prevent casual copying. An install limit, however, only harms paying customers who upgrade/change hardware or reload software frequently. The publishers need to learn that restrictive DRM damages their paying customers, as well as fails to prevent pirates from doing what they do.Overall, if you think the idea of a unique, dynamic simulation game would be fun to you, give this game a try.Fun: 4/5Generally: 3/5 (4 - 1 for DRM)"
3,cool,the game came in perfect condition book and everything the only problem now is i already beaten it hope for anouther cheap yet fun game soon
1,Fun but no multi-login!,With 1 computer we were planning on playing Spore with our seperate logons the same way we play other games. But that's a big no go! EA has seen fit to not allow multiple logons ON THE SAME COMPUTER!! So we have to settle for limiting ourselves with sharing the universe. This would be OK if it were just the 2 of us but I'd like to let my son play too. But with 3 of us we're limited to 2 planets per and will end up unlocking things that the other 2 haven't earned yet etc...This user limitation is just dumb. Does EA expect families to have 1 computer per family member?!? I'd love that but can't afford it.I will be attempting to return the game. Maybe later on we can buy it again when EA fixes this issue.
1,Had so much potential,"Unfortunately, this game had SO much potential. Seeing the demo videos and trailers... and it coming from the Sim master himself, I figured this game would be tremendous fun.I tried the Creature Creator utility (sold seperately) and had some fun with it.Sadly, they managed to mess up this game. The creatures do not evolve, they only Level Up. Aside from the ability to customize the LOOK of your characters to a marvelous degree, the ABILITIES stay the same. If you level up two completely different-looking creatures - say one with blades for hands and bipedal... and the other some gentle looking thing with 6 legs... guess what? They BOTH have the SAME abilities to hunt, walk, mate and Level Up if you play them the same way.I think that's the biggest failure of this game. I get more variety from stat-based Levelling Up in Square-Enix games!"
1,Yet Another Disappointed Gamer,"As an avid strategy gamer, I was anticipating Spore's release...Then I found out about the DRM.I will not pay a game company to install malware on my computer. I will not buy a game that I cannot reinstall a few years down the line when I have upgraded my computer multiple times. I will not support a company that uses illegal copy protection methods that have been proven to cause a lot of technical problems for its customers.It's really too bad. Spore looks like a pretty interesting game. Hopefully it will be available in the future without the intrusive and insulting ""security"" measures."
1,I cannot sell this game,I buy original games for two reasons:1) i want to support the developers2) if i don't like the game i can sell it when i finish and get back some of my money...I came today here to buy spore but1) i don't want to support developers that are stupid enough to punish people that actually buy the game2) I cannot sell the game... I can just use it on my machine...So i will not buy this game... sorry EA
1,Swayed by DRM,"Well, I don't have much input other than maybe adding my vote will encourage EA to change their anti-consumer stance. I was literally on my way to buy this game when I saw 800-something reviews and a one-star average. This game is already cracked...proving (again) that DRM only affects consumers.I was really excited about Spore and this is nothing short of tragic."
1,DRM = No go.,"I was really excited about Spore when I first heard about it...couldn't wait to play it. Now that I know it has DRM, I will not buy it. What a shame."
1,"Fun game, bad DRM","I know this game is fun, and I loved Sim City, Sim Ant, Sim Tower, etc., but there's just some lines that I wouldn't cross. Why would I want to pay someone to install crappy DRM on my computer?"
1,I will never subject myself to DRM,"For me to spend money on this game it would be to buy it. I will not rent the game (3 installs) for this price, which is what the DRM is essentially doing. This is a dishonest and invasive move by EA."
1,"Sorry, but the potential is lost in the DRM","I didn't buy this at Amazon, but I wanted to add my voice to those who are frustrated with the DRM. Any potential the game had was swallowed by the invasive DRM."
1,Terrible DRM and so so gameplay,"The DRM on this game is terrible, 3 installs and your done...game over. I have been playing for about 10 hours and the game is not near what I thought it was going to be, I am returning my copy of the game."
1,Do not buy,"This game utilizes a piece of malware called securom which is installed without warning along with the game. What securom does is prevent you from installing the game more than the number of times the company wants you to. It is a difficult to remove, wastes resources, and can prevent you from playing the game you paid for. After installing 3 times you must call EA customer support and beg them to let you play the game you bought. This is not a toll-free call.This game should be considered a rental. I suggest not buying this game, and if you do, keep in mind that you may not be able to play it in the future. I bought the game but am returning it because I don't want to end up with a game I can't play because I got a new computer.As for the game itself, I find creating things with it very fun, but there is really no story and even on hard it's not very challenging unless you intentionally handicap yourself."
1,Boo on EA,Boo on this game's implementation of DRM. Boo on treating legitimate customers like thieves and letting the real thieves play the game without any issues whatsoever. EA needs to look to Stardock for inspiration.
1,"No, I will not buy this (yet)",I'm not going to bother with a detailed review except to say:DRMs suck.EA can go jump off a cliff.
1,Vista problems & crappy DRM,"I bought the game today and before I purchased it I made sure I double checked the system requirements and that my cheap laptop met them all, it does. I installed the game without a hitch, it took about fifteen minutes to run the installer, and the game will not open. It shows the process in the Task Manager but the game never completely opens, I've tried running it as an administrator and in XP compatibility mode with no luck. Luckily I've not had an issues with the DRM (I would not have bought the game if I had read these reviews before, my fault for not doing my research) since I can't even open the game. I did not buy Spore from Amazon, I bought it locally and the store won't take an opened game back, so I guess I'm out $50. My suggestion is don't even bother buying the game, if you can actually play it the DRM will screw everything else up. Save your money."
1,$49.99 to much for game rental,$49.99 + DRM is too much to pay when the game is only a rental after the DRM. $29.99 would be an acceptable price.
1,Won't buy with DRM,"Since this game has DRM I will not buy. It is that simple.I came here ready to click on ""buy with one click"" and have it here tomorrow with next-day (cheap) prime shipping.The review showing it has DRM was extremely helpful in me determining NOT TO BUY.It is not necessary to actually own the game to make this determination and I am glad someone posted it has DRM."
1,"If you are a 10 year old kid, it's probably fun.","All complexity has been removed from the game. You pretty much spend all your time clicking 1000's of times all over the screen and that's it. No interactions other than clicking and occasionally adding dumb and limited additions to your creature.They spent all of their time making a cartoonish world with lots of graphics, but no real game play. If you are a 10 year old, it's probably fun for a couple of days. As an adult, it's mind-numbing."
1,Comes with its own malware!,The associated malware with this game installed itself without permission and immediately stopped my CD-burner from working. The only way I could get rid of it was by completely formatting my hard drive and reinstalling everything from scratch. Avoid at all costs!
2,#3000 DRM mania!,Game never lived up to the hype. It was in production for so long that I don't think any game could've lived up to the overwhelming hype. Regardless this game is sub par and not as evolutionary and we had hoped.
1,Stupid DRM,"I reinstall Windows about 3-4 times a year, only way to truly clean it out. With this crazy DRM approach I can't play the legit copy of this game. Guess I better fire up a torrent client or something... or better yet, why have a limit on installations and just validate via the Internet... sheesh, this is not rocket science."
1,DRM Prevents Legitimate Use - Do not buy.,"The DRM has prevented two friends from even installing the game. It's highly encrypted activation system can't get through many university firewalls. I've had a couple of friends call me for help with the situation, and it's just been a headache.Like many I had high hopes for this game. Don't waste your $$ on this frustration. Maybe someday they will re-release it without these issues."
1,Installs a DRM on your PC that is HARD to REMOVE!!!,I tried to remove the DRM that this thing installs onto your computer but its like a virus and is hard to remove. I would never recommend this game to anyone because of the DRM that is installed onto your computer and hides itself. Do yourself a favor and buy another game which does not have this if you care about keeping your computer clean.
2,"Buy it, play it, give it away to fight the copy-protection (DRM)","I bought it, it's not a bad game, but I'm tired of being treated like a pirate by the game companies.I'll be playing it until I'm tired of it and then give it to a friend of relative to play. This way- EA loses real money, not fake money from invisible pirates."
1,DRM Actitvation Reminded Me Of Microsoft's Distrust,"The DRM Activation & 3 key limit reminded that Microsoft thinks we're all pirates, & Microsoft wonders why their image is going down the toilet.I don't care if this is the best game of all time I refuse to purchase anything that limits my activations.No Sale here, in fact I might just have to download a ""Torrent"", if I can run it on something other than ""Vista"", another great Microsoft product.. Yea, Right.."
1,A Decade of Development for a Popcap Game,"No offense to popcap.com, love their games!Spore is fun, no doubt, for about an hour. It's first level is definitely unique, maybe the second, but beyond that we've seen it, done it, conquered it all before. This game may have a hook for some players who like tinkering with creatures, building everything they can imagine... unfortunately no matter how you build your critter, you're stuck playing the same simplistic games.OK. Now about actually installing the game. I can live with activation. I don't mind letting the mother ship know I have the game. But, limiting me to three installs of the game? We're running PCs for goodness sake. Three reformats and a few hardware upgrades is a GOOD year. Make me put the CD in the drive to play. Fine. Make me activate online. Fine. Make me pay $50. Fine. But telling me it is all wasted the fourth time I install. Goodbye."
1,Very Let Down,"Having waited for months, played the Creature Creator, and otherwise greatly looked forward to this release, I will now be returning the un-opened game to Amazon. Too many of my friends have had problems with the installation.Perhaps I will re-consider in the future if EA gets their act together."
1,Boring,"It was 2 days of boring play. After that I couldn't give the game more time and asked 7 years son-in-law to try it out. The ability to customize your character caught his attention for about 1 hour, then the game itself for additional 2-3 hours and then he asked ""what else?"" - the question I've been asking myself several times. For a game that was waited for many years, this is a total failure of Will Wright. I mean, how the creator of SimCity and Sims could get to such low-level boring game without visible AI - computer player is predictable and is not fun at all.Not worth buying, not even worth lending from your friend."
1,DRM will not allow the game to launch,"I was very excited with my initial purchase of this game... Spore really looked like a very fun, novel idea that had been long in the making.Though I read that there were DRM issues associated with Spore, I did not let it affect my decision to purchase the game. Well lo and behold, I installed the game on my high end Vista system, and I immediately get locked out it of by the DRM software SecuROM.I have sent 2 emails to EA, and we are still in the process of ""unlocking"" the game. I have owned Spore for 2 days, and have yet to play it.To Electronic Arts: when one of your customers pays $50 dollars for your software, please do not treat that person like a criminal by including DRM software."
1,A Lost Sale,"I came to purchase Spore, but after reading the reviews, I have decided not to purchase the game. Its an awful large expense for no more than 2 years of play, judging by EA's deactivation of other games. Any program that gives itself elevated system privileges is just asking to be targeted by a virus capable of serious damage. The activation limit does not bother me terribly, but being unable to separate my creatures from those belonging to others in my household is another inconvenience.In a way, this is actually two lost sales, as I will not be buying the upcoming Red Alert 3 unless the DRM is removed or is changed to be less invasive. I have purchased the previous installments in the series, and they easily rank among my favorite games, but I am choosing to vote with my wallet on this issue. Its just too bad that this had to happen to two amazing games."
1,I'm sure most of the 1-stars will be removed but...,"... they actually were useful to me, anyway. I had intended to purchase Spore, not realizing it used SecuROM. I purchased Bioshock, which used SecuROM, and to this day the disc is nothing more than expensive coaster because I've never been able to get its null-byted registry entries to work correctly in XP 64-bit Pro.Like I said, I imagine most, if not all, of the 1 stars below (and possibly mine as well) will get removed, but it saved me money at any rate. I really want to play Spore, but with this restrictive garbage included, I doubt I'll actually be able to, and I'm not willing to gamble another $50 to find out."
1,"Don't Bother, Mac Users","If you buy spore for mac, be prepared for disappointment. I put the disc in my computer, and get no playable response. I guess an Intel-based laptop with maxed out ram running leopard STILL isn't enough to meet system requirements.I would say i'm disappointed, but based on the rest of the reviews, I'm thinking the game isn't worth the bother."
1,Re: Business,"""....even if EA keeps the activation servers going, there IS going to be a time when EA will simply cease to exist because of financial issues or federal laws (like most business eventually do).""I truly hope so. Maybe then I can even go back to playing PC games."
1,Disappointed,"I was really excited about this game when I saw the first presentation videos. It looked very cool and interesting. Now, as it's been crippled by DRM and apparently dumbed down as well, I'm definitely not looking forward to it anymore. I only hope it's not as sloppy and unfinished as SimCity Societies was."
1,I was going to buy multiple copies....,"I heard about Spore in a game store about 8 months ago and it seemed extremely interesting. As I learned more about it, I decided that when it came out, I would buy copies for me, my daughter, and probably a friend of mine.However, after reading about the DRM in various venues, buying this game is not an option, nor is it for any other program with securom or DRM. I buy new computers and/or repurpose them frequently and if I buy software, I ""own"" it and will move it around between computers as I see fit or need. (""own"" a license to use it on one computer at a time)Not only will I not buy this game, I have forbidden my daughter to do so with her laptop because of the DRM software that is reported to be installed. I'm not considering any comments about the game in my decision."
1,Treated like a thief after buying this game,"Anti-piracy software embedded in this game left my son unable to play it even though he'd handed over his $50+tax, an error message appeared suggesting we were software pirate thieves.It is simply unacceptable for any digital rights management measure to prevent even one honest paying customer from using the product, particularly when no-one will issue a refund for opened software.So what happens now?"
1,Don't. Buy. This.,"I was looking forwards to this game, but... after learning about the steps they've taken to keep it from being piracy, hell no.Not only does a fourth installation require begging permission from an EA call center (which WILL stop functioning eventually - if only because EA itself, like any software corporation, isn't going to be around forever), but it auto-installs Securom, to monitor your computer against your use of other software that might possibly be pirated. Auto-installs. No choice. Runs in the background, eating resources. Can't be removed by anything short of reformatting the computer.Don't buy Spore. Or anything else that EA produces with this sort of intrusive, disabling insult to their customers."
1,Terrible Game,"I REGRET HAVING EVER BOUGHT THIS GAME IT IS AWFUL AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK.That being said, amazon shipped my order hella fast. Five stars for you, amazon warehouse worker."
1,RootKit Seals the Deal,"I pre-ordered this game and was looking forward to playing it. However now that I know it will have SecureROM installed, I refuse to install this DRM/RootKit onto my PC. I'll be sending it back for a full refund.While I'm sure I'll miss a good game.. I'm doubly sure I won't miss software installed on my PC that I can't uninstall or control in any way at all."
2,More hype than game,"I'll leave the DRM arguments to the other people here. I've played the game now and gotten all the way to the last stage in a few hours. Honestly it was fun but I really can't see how you could re-play this game. The scenery might change but it's pretty much the same game. I've watched this game since it's inception and I've been nothing but excited. When I finally got to play it I was sort of disappointed. The biggest thing was that it was supposed to roll game play like Civ and Warcraft into one big universe. And it does but Spore's version is akin to buying the playschool version of Civ. Fun? Yeah for a bit. Honestly i wouldn't worry about the DRM 3 install limit, you won't be in this game long enough to need to reinstall it. You'll play it for a week... then put it on the shelf and back to WOW or Xbox."
1,"Clever in Theory, Disappointing in Execution",I'd been looking forward to Spore for months but unfortunately a combination of repetitive gameplay elements and restrictive DRM hold this title back. Not worth $50.
1,"Broken, Intentionally","I bought this game yesterday and installed it. It didn't work with my video drivers so I followed a suggestion on the site and reinstalled it with some modifications. After a few separate attempts, I think I finally nailed down the problem.Unfortunately, we'll never know because I ran out of ""installs."" Electronic Arts popped a message up informing me that this game was only ""good"" for 3 installs, and I was holding a brick. If I wanted to install Spore - this game, that I own - again, I had to call a hotline and plead my case to a phone jockey.I decided to plead my case to a business that didn't consider me to be a paroled criminal instead, namely the store where I bought it, which offered me a refund as per their grown-up customer service policy."
1,Might be good if it would actually run,"Spent over 4 hours trying to get the game to run without success. Windows Vista, 2GB RAM, 512MB Video card... clearly meets the specs but can't get it to run. I'll be contacting EA for a refund... and apparently after reading these reviews instructions on removing any DRM rootkit they might have added to my machine as well. Very disappointing, my kid was looking forward to playing this game."
1,"Maxis: Good, EA: Bad","I feel sorry for the developers. It's a fun game, but I cannot handle the notion of asking permission to use something I already purchased. Install limits, background processes and fears of a new Sony-esque ""Extended Copy Protection"" aside: I shouldn't have to call Penguin Publishing to verify when I want to read a book I bought, or Universal when I want to watch a movie. If we truly do not own the content we purchase, then simply call it what it is and charge a service access fee."
1,Spore sucks!,Game is full of bugs and after fighting with multiple installs on two PC's to get it running I cannot install it anymore due to the registration system. Called EA and they said they would forward a request to open up more installs on my account but it would take 48 hours. No suggestions on the numerous install problems and game crashes. Oddly enough it plays ok on my Mac.
1,Being Returned Without Even Opening,"I am sick and tired of companies hijacking my computer, my operating system, and my time with DRM software like SecuROM. I am so fed up that I will be returning the pre-ordered collectors edition that is scheduled to arrive tomorrow morning. I was very much anticipating spending some real quality time with this game, however I will not put up SecuROM or any other method of copy protection that puts these sorts of draconian limits on what I can and can not do with software that I've purchased."
1,decent but won't purchase because of DRM,I saw this game at a friends house and thought it was ok but after reading all the reviews and seeing the game it's not worth the money to deal with the DRM. EA should know better. :( Stay Away
1,"Pre-Ordered, may be returning.","I've been eagerly awaiting the release of this game for years and pre-ordered it months ago. I am now bitterly disappointed to learn of the outrageous DRM policy. As someone who has a lot of hardware who tends to reformat hard drives from time to time, this is a real problem. Much as I was looking forward to Spore, I may now simply ship it back. Disgusting!"
4,Lowered Expectations,"Look everybody don't hang the team that put together Spore. Everyone was expecting them to reinvent the wheel and they didn't, they did something better, created a fun game. Spore does have flaws but when you have such an open ended game(as far as character creation is concerned) there are going to be issues. So take a breath and take in what you are experiencing. This is a rpg, rts, p&c adv., and a buch of other abbreviations rolled up into one. It is this diversity that makes this game great and ultimately flawed. It is fun to get to go through all these different games with the same character but there was so much to do the creators didn't have a chance to make all phases of the game work perfectly. Or at least that is how I feel. Spore is fun and encourages creativity, it also has never crashed or given any other types of technical issues. I say give it a chance and you might be suprised."
1,DRM is BAD,I've been following this game for a year and I won't buy it because of the DRM. I will not support Spore.
1,DRM bad,Like most here. It's this simple. This game will not be a purchase at all with the DRM it has in it. I was so set to buy it too but I will not knowing that EA decided to go with the worst of the worst for copy protection.
1,Fun...very fun...but DRM is a game killer,"I bought it. Played it till my eyes bled. Its fun. But, the DRM is serious business and no place in PC games. I wanted so bad to play Spore, i let it slide until i started to get uneasy. These DRM things are a lot like the Sony Root Kits. I dont take kindy to these things being installed on MY COMPY!I removed Spore, formated my PC...good thing Spore has been cracked already :))"
1,"Buggy, won't load, no auto save lose hours of gameplay","First off the game worked well, played for hours, then it started getting buggy. Locked up and lost hours of gameplay because no auto save.Then after playing again and getting to where I had first left off in the middle of the creature stage I saved and quit. When I tried to play again the game wouldn't load. Won't load. Can't play. I've visited the forums and hundreds of people are having the same problems. Can't even play the game. Wait until they patch and fix the many problems with this game before purchasing."
1,DRM = Reason I will not buy,"ok, the game is fun and revolutionary, but the DRM makes this game suck.Why can I only install 3 times? What happens when EA's servers go down?I'll be damned if i pay for something that oneday will just stop working!"
1,DRM and End-Game Suck,"this game really sucks, the first phases are cute but boring and way simplistic, always doing the same things but in different ways, its boring and not challenging at all, you kill or eat fruit you charm or kill some more yayyy... NOT then you get to space age, that besides being even more boring its super incredibly repetitive and idiotic, you only have one ship while every single freaking race out in space hates you guts and they have freaking fleets of ships that magically appear on your planets all the freaking time, and thats besides pirates and eco disasters and thats it.. you have 3 variables to work with and this is in easy... i feel robbed, this game sucks, thats what i think"
1,Bought it... can't stand the DRM.,"I think I'm done gaming until companies respect the sanctity of your own computer. Meaning no programs spying on you, No processes that run all the time whether you are playing or not, no modifications to boot sectors, no removing other software, etc."
1,"On second thought, I'll pass","I was ready to buy this but the DRM is way too extreme. Perhaps I'm just old fashioned, but I expect games to be mine forever no matter how many new computers or reformattings I go through. If all games were this way, I would no longer be able to play some of my favorite games, including Everquest, The Sims, Sim City, and World of Warcraft. No thanks, EA."
1,I was interested. But not now.,"Are you sick of having to try to call customer service reps for everything? Just to have you routed through endless automated promps. Yes, they have even destroyed they games we love and play to ""RELAX""EA you have got to be kidding me. Yeah I havent played it. Now I won't either. Grow up ! Everyone isn't trying to steal everything."
1,Was going to purchase Spore but the DRM has scared me off.,"Why EA and other game companies believe that treating all their customers like criminals and installing low-level nanny programs (that are hard to install) in their customers' PCs is beyond me. The people who steal games will steal games, this only serves to annoy and drive away legitimate, honest customers. Like me. Sorry EA, would have liked to play Spore, but there are plenty of other games out there that don't treat me like a criminal or limit my resale options. Thanks but no thanks."
1,Enough with the DRM!,"DRM only hurts legitimate consumers. Anyone who pirates games will find a way to do so regardless of what publishers try. On the other hand, people who actually purchase the game get screwed dealing with the inconvenience and poorly developed crap robbing system resources.Enough already."
5,Longtime Love Affair,"I, like many of you, drooled over Spore's release date in anticipation. Even though I admit that I was disappointed that they did not take it as far as we all hoped they would (like the fish/water stage), I still understand why they had to leave it out to make it possible.It is still a wonderful and imaginative game that sparks critical thinking and creative skills while teaching some basics of 3-d modeling while highlighting the generalized basics of evolutionary principals.I've played this game for years, and enjoy every creation as well as being inspired by the millions of creations posted to share online daily. Even after all this time, I still would recommend this game wholeheartedly."
1,DRM infected,The game gets really repetitive and boring after playing it once. DRM makes it not worth your while.
2,"Forget about DRM, the game sucks anyway","Its just not fun. No real strategy and you can ""complete"" the game in about 5 hours. It is like a 3 hour advanced character creator."
1,All Potential Lost,"The potential of this game is erased because the makers wanted to go ahead and secretly add copy protection software and in effect ruin it for me and many more potential customers. AT LEAST PUT A STATEMENT ON THE BOX WHICH SAYS THAT IT WILL COME WITH COPY PROTECTION SOFTWARE. That's just low. But what can you expect, all these companies are concerned about is money, NOTHING ELSE. You would be a fool to believe that they care about you and what you think and what you feel. NO, they might say that but only because they want your money. OK - now you know."
1,Onerous DRM = Not worth it,"Over 2000 one star reviews thanks to DRM. And yet, a single torrent for a hacked Spore currently has over 26000 peers. Good job alienating your customers, EA."
1,I was excited after the early videos,"I was pretty excited for this game after the videos I've watched over the past few years. Unfortunately, I will not be buying the game given the DRM issues. I'm not interested in ""buying"" a game that will expire as I change operating systems or computers."
1,1%,"""Despite this, EA has no intention to change the DMR copy protection system, corporate communications manager Mariam Sughayer reasoning that less than 25% of users install games more than once and also that less than 1% of them try to install their games more than three times.""I bought Homeworld many years ago. I still play it. Between failed hard drives and system upgrades, I have installed this game many, many times. EA's logic seems to ignore the fact that they are inconveniencing the people who will be the game's biggest fans and longest-lasting players. Having learned of EA's DRM policy, I have no intention of installing Spore even once. I'd much rather play something I already have, which I know that I can continue to enjoy."
1,DRM is quite restrictive,"This is actually a game that I would like to have bought, but I will not buy this it because of the DRM restrictions. I do not want spy-software on my computer that monitors my activities. If I would like to install the game 10 times, that is my right. And if I want to sell my copy the game to someone else I have the right do to that.Maybe I would like to install it in 10 years time from now, but with DRM the chances are slim that I can do that. How long will they have the dail-in phone activated? Hmm??And I do not want to be treated like a criminal. That is what DRM does. It treats me like a criminal. So the easiest thing is not to buy anything with DRM. There is lots of other nice stuff to buy that don't have it :)"
5,Fun... regardless of negative press,"Despite the negative press this game has gotten, I have had no issues with it. The install went flawlessly and, overall, it's fun to play. This is destined to become another classic from Will Wright."
1,NO THANKS!,"If you buy a wheel for your car, does it evaporate when you put it on a different car? If you buy this game and have to load it on your computer more than twice, rather changing computers or taking it off one and putting it on another, it will break! THANKS BUT NO THANKS..."
1,"Don't Buy, DRM restrictions will come back to haunt you","Like everyone else is saying please don't buy this game it will encourage EA to keep putting DRM on future software, which means that you'll only be able to install it 3 times then you have to buy the game again, and once their activation servers are gone in a few years you won't be able to play it period, regardless of whether you used all your activations. It's a terribly unfair system to the consumers."
1,horrid DRM,think this game is for you? not if you plan on having to install it more than 3 times.. try to do that.. and your RENTAL is over.. no more game for you.. gotta buy it again.. think thats a good way to spend $50? what if their activation servers go down.. game over..your voice.. your vote...
1,drm infected,"don't bother getting this game, it is so crippled by DRM that it kills what would have been a good game."
1,DRM ruins this product,"Can not possibly conceive of installing this malware laden garbage on my computer. Its a shame that Will Wright's software is not accessible due to onerous use restrictions. You only can install it 3 times - that's it - 3 times for the price. If you change your computer hardware, upgrade or simply have to reinstall your operating system due to a variety of problems, make sure that it never goes above 3 times, or you just bought a useless program. Add to that the requirement that the program requires an activation server to be running, and you might not be able to use this program outside of the next year or two, in case EA suddenly decides to take them down, as did many activation servers required to listen to music people thought they bought last year."
1,Horrible DRM.,"It would have been a great game, IF, ONLY IF, not for the horrendous DRM restrictions. Stay away until they fix it!"
1,looking for DRM free version,I've removed my order for the game and am waiting for a re-release without the DRM and rootkit type problems that this one appears to have based on these reviews.I was so looking forward to this game.What a shame.-Don
1,Not a chance until the DRM goes,"There is absolutely no way I'm buying this game until the SecuRom rubbish and limited installations are removed. I'm sick and tired of buying games that are inferior to the cracked versions available for free from pirate sites. I didn't buy Mass Effect for the same reason and I won't be buying this. Congratulations EA, you've just cost yourself two sales AND your game was pirated pre-release in any case."
1,DRM...? It's horrible. Major dealbreaker.,"Sorry that an otherwise good game is getting slammed by the DRM implementation, but count me in on that bandwagon. I have a laptop, and a desktop -- both of which I plan on replacing soon. Looks like I'll have to buy *another* copy of this game if I intend to play it on both when I upgrade. Stay far, far away from this. It's too hard to justify spending the money on something so limited. I was really looking forward to playing this, too. I promptly returned my copy when I found this out. DRM FTF."
1,not worth breaking my computer,"i built my computer from spare parts, and after seeing my friends computer stop working 6 ways from sunday after installing this game, i'm not even about to try.If it was DRM free, i might give it a try. as it is, i'm more likely to try the leaked and pirated version without any drm."
1,Stop the DRM,"I don't own the game and do not plan a buying it now. The invasive DRM is a show stopper. For those who ""don't understand"" the one star reviews of this game regarding the DRM, you caused me to post this. For every one of you there are hundreds of me. We are people who are fed up, sick and tired of bad business decisions that shove unwanted restrictions on us. Installing more than three times is completely conceivable over the course of several years. This DRM is garbage and makes the game garbage. You can tolerate bad DRM, good for you. I won't."
1,Returning the game!!!,"I bought this game yesterday from a local retailer. Have yet to install it. I have the creature creator installed on my PC and was excited to see the dozen or so creatures I have created come to life when the real game came out. Upon reading about SecuROM and what it has been known to do, Such as Installing a Rootkit! Circumventing Admin Rights! And Constantly running, even when the game isn't!I have since elected to return my Spore game and uninstall the Creature Creator. Hopefully, I don't have any malware left over from the Creature Creator. And if I do, hopefully, I can get it off my PC."
1,The last straw!,"Ok this is it, this is the last time I will buy any PC game, ever.Why buy games legally and get DRM installed on your rig, when the pirated versions are DRM free?"
1,I'll pass,"I was looking forward to this game, but with Securom AND a limited 3 installs, I'll pass on it."
1,"Once I discovered the dirty DRM, the game was immediatly tainted",I can't enjoy a game where the publisher treats the customer as if he were a parolled felon
4,Please note most 1 star reviews are from people who didn't even buy/play the game!,"There's quite a bit of politics going on here in the Spore reviews. Most (if not all) of the 1 star reviews are from people who did not buy or even play the game due to the fact that the game uses DRM.The game itself is very fun and worth the purchase.DRM is indeed a bad idea, but its use should not drop the average rating down to 1 star."
2,I can't believe I paid $50 for this,"Yet another reminder not to listen to hype and to check Amazon reviews before buying. DRM aside, this is just not that great a game. It's a collection of 5 been-there-done-that mini games that individually would go for maybe $5 in the bargain bin, if that. EA already gave one of them away for free. 3D graphics are cool, online content sharing is cool, but neither are new. Cosmetics aside, there's just not much complexity in game strategy - there aren't that many different things to do, so once you've played it once, there doesn't seem to be much point in playing again. I could live with that for a $20 game, but this thing is seriously overpriced. There's no way I'm paying even more for expansion packs. I feel like a sucker as it is."
1,"Such a shame, such a shame","The game looks fantastic, but I absolutely refuse to give any company my money when they treat their customers that way.So, to play your game, I have to allow invasive root-kit control of my machine, and I only get three installs before it's junked? I have a better idea. I'll go ride a bike."
1,DRM for everyone,Game is very fun but the DRM is a real bitch and screws up the game. And for any pc user that upgrades or reformats three times you lose the game kind of like paying for something and not owning it.
1,What a joke...,"On top of the DRM issues, now it comes out that each copy of the game can only have one account, i.e. if you buy a copy and your wife/kids/siblings want to play, they either have to play as your character or buy another copy of the game to set up their own account. This despite the instruction manual stating that multiple accounts could be played on one copy of the game. The Evil Empire, AKA EA strikes again. My copy is going back."
1,DRM = pissed off customers,"Nice work EA, congratulations on pissing off all your customers. I was going to buy this game but after reading about your DRM system i'm just not going to bother. And for the record, I never pirate games but if a crack comes out for Spore I just might. Idiots."
1,"Good, game, but i want to play this 5 years from now","This game is great! I love building games, sim city, garry's mod, so on. The only issue is the DRM, i want to be able to play this game later on down the road, much like i still play sim city 4.The game play is great, just wish there was a way to instntly jump into layers, galaxy, solar system, planet layer without holding + or -. The game play is far form lack luster, if you play it like halo and try to rush to the end (center of the galaxy) then this is not your genre. I'm hoping an expansion adds more parts to the creator system.So, great game, bad execution with the wanna-be steam, updater thing, and use of DRM. This game will never be a classic if you can not play it in the future to have those ""good ol times"" like you can with DOOM or Sim City 2000. $50 for a game that will not survive the test of time (Aside from pirated, non DRM versions), and future solutions for content sharing / servers. I bought it as I'm an aspirating game developer."
1,SecuROM equals lost sale from me!!!,"First off I am no pirate. I own over 150 CDS and around 125 DVDS that are not pirated and bought and paid for by me, the consumer. I also own all the old Rainbow Six PC games, Swat 3 & 4, No One Lives Forever 1 & 2, Soldier of Fortune 1 & 2, etc. So, that statement made that all the 1 star reviewers are pirates is complete bull. But for a company to force you to install a program with out your permission and to limit your activations gladly prompts me to 1 star a product. People move through computer today like no other and 3 activations is not a lot. In our house hold alone we have 3 lab tops and 4 desktops. Now what am I supposed to do now? Make a call to EA, which is not free, to beg them to let me install my game that I paid for on all of my computers!? From this day forth I am not going to buy any PC game released by EA."
1,A Message to EA,"Dear EA,If this is any indication, you might want to reconsider your DRM strategy, I know I am only one customer, but I thought I should let you know. Ditch the DRM and I buy the game. Keep the DRM, and folks like Stardock will be the only company that gets my money ever again. w00t Demi-God!-An (almost) lost customer"
1,Please cut back on the DRM,"Pirates will always beat the DRM. Just stop with the DRM. Also the game is really simple, and not much fun."
1,Not buying until DRM is removed,"My friend had a copy of the sims and the DRM on it crashed her computer.Now I find out that the Spore game has the exact same DRM, secuROM, on it. I am not in the least bit interested in having my computer crash too."
1,Remove The DRM,"Three installs? Installing hidden folders? come on EA - I know you just want to get as much money out of this as possible but give us control over what we buy. Im are happy to reward good policies(like no drm), and actually trusting the consumer will give you a much better image.The Game itself - Ive played this on a friends computer and id like to say its not all I expected, but still entertaining. The world / game play seems too rigid. maybe the galaxy section is where it gets more interesting?.."
1,Awful DRM loses another customer,"My husband and I have been excitedly anticipating the release of Spore for years, watching early game demos and reading any news about the game that we could get our hands on. We were initially thrilled to learn that Spore would finally be released this September 08. But after learning about the awful DRM that comes with the game, in particular the 3 install limit, we have decided NOT to purchase Spore. We don't want to ""rent"" Spore! We expect any game that we purchase to be a game that we will hopefully be playing for years, maybe even decades. A limit of three installations makes that impossible. And we encourage other gamers to refuse to buy Spore until EA realizes that having such restrictive DRM only affects their potential customers, while doing nothing to combat game piracy."
1,Please note most reviews that are not 1 star don't mind having maleware forced on their PC and being treated like a thief.,"I have waited years for this game. I have owned many other EA titles, more than any other company. I had expected to buy the Galactic version.I have nothing against DRM systems in general. The one EA uses, SecuROM, has twice been sued by the federal government for putting what amounts to a trojan/virus/malware on people's PCs that stays there after the games are removed.The DRM for Spore has already been hacked and cracked. Now the only people who will suffer from the insulting DRM are those of us who only buy legal software.How DARE they sell a product and then tell you how many times you may use it?EA will never get another penny from me until they lose the offensive SecuROM DRM"
1,Didn't install on Vista and overly simplistic on XP,Okay cool cool so you get to make your own creature. whopty do. If can't get the stupid game to install it doesn't matter anyway. It refuses to start up on windows vista. I have uninstalled and re installed 3 or 4 times. How ridiculous is that.Then I installed on a XP machine i have and sure its cool that I can create my own creature but that's about it the interface sucks. Its like I'm playing a bunch of mini games that really don't amount to much. I could go out and buy much better developed games. yet another example of engineers focusing on cool features rather then simple game play.
3,Spore: A Galactic Dissapointment,"For a game that was in development for three years since it was announced at E3, Spore really makes you wonder what they spent all that time doing. The cell and creature stages are pretty much as advertised, but the tribal and civilization stages are extremely simple and watered down. I pretty much lost interest once I got to space, but I assume it's more of the same.For such a hyped game, it was a huge let down."
1,DRM Blows,EA has been getting worse every release they make. They need to fire all their execs and start over.
1,Thanks for the warning,"My wife and I have been looking forward to this game coming out for a while as she is a huge Sims fan. We were thinking about buying this game in a couple weeks with our monthly ""fun"" money, but now I am reconsidering. Her computer is due for an OS upgrade and we will probably upgrade the hardware in the next six months. So that's three uses right there.Thanks for ruining a what looked like a great game, EA."
1,Won't buy game with DRM. EVER.,"The DRM ruins this game for me. I refuse to pay money for this intrusive, draconian ""protection system"". I was looking forward to this game's release, but there is no way on earth I would buy it now."
1,DRM makes this game a no no.,"This game has the right concept, but including the agressive DRM only allowing 3 installs. Not right. Is this a rental or a buy?"
1,"Great Game, Bad DRM","This game (having played it at a friend's house) is all kinds of fun. The sad thing is that he can only install the game 3 times, and then it won't run anymore. So, if you want to pay $50 for a game that only installs three times, be my guest. If, on the other hand, your computer has EVER broken or MIGHT EVER break, or if you plan on replacing your computer eventually, you'll run through those 3 installs pretty quickly. I'd save your $50 - it's just not worth it."
1,How do I know if it is good?,"Because of the drm that this product is infected with, I will never play it. I wish other companies would follow the example that Blizzard has been setting over the past year and opt to go drm-free. I have the CDs for my Blizzard games sitting safely on a bookshelf -- where they belong."
5,The best book on the Noble Eightfold Path that I have read,"Sangharakshita has laid out in a clear, lucid style the essence of the Buddha's Eighfold Noble Path in terms accesable to a western reader. It avoids the cliches of ""don'ts"" found in many books treating this subject and explores each of the eight steps in great detail. I showed this book to one of my Buddhist teacher monks and he immediately made it part of a two year training session that he is conducting"
4,Nice glossies - Decent book for the genre,"Next to the Cathal Tohill book, this is about the best you're gonna find concerning Italian giallo and horror. Many of the films described are also now available on DVD so you can judge for yourself. The only big flaw is that the titles are in Italian so you better get yourself a good translator or be prepared to look them up on the imdb.I also find the review by JJJJS of Toronto to be utterly bizarre. Why would one review a book for a genre one doesn't like to begin with? What a waste of time!This is for fans only, since more obscure titles by directors I've yet to discover are included, as well as photos and color stills from the various films. If you don't appreciate this kind of film then stay away."
3,"Soft, melodic and quite nice","This is quite a soft trance CD, nice for the mornings. It is very melodic and quite often fading out to quite ambient sounds.It's not bad, but a little commercial for quite a few tracks."
4,A foodie's guide to my heart .,"I was delighted to have come across this book. While I'm not much of a cook, I like to think that I could be. This book makes it sound easy and, more importantly, FUN. I recommend it to anyone interested in eating, shopping, or cooking or for an ""off the beaten track"" cultural/culinary tour of our great city of Chicago. Hats off to the author; she probably weighs a ton by now but it must have been an interesting journey. (Great cover, too!)"
4,For Animal Lovers,"Allen M. Schoen, D.V.M., M.S., author of ""Kindred Spirits"" has written a sensitive book that pulled me in from the beginning. I have to confess that I am a person who feels more in touch with animals than than I do with most people. I have enjoyed reading this book so far and would recommend it to any adult who enjoys understanding the complex relationship between man and the animals around us. It is easy to read and full of wonderful anecdotes from the author's experience as a vet."
4,The World Needs More Dr. Schoens,"This book is a great primer for people who have an inkling that our relationship with animals runs deep and is often spiritual or even mystical.Dr. Schoen has given us a one-stop shopping source, with introductions to: alternative medicine for animals, alternatives to commercial pet food, and ways to enrich the human-animal bond through touch, massage, and meditation.Buy it as a gift for someone whose eyes are opening to the reality that we are all connected and responsible for each other."
3,Average Crankset,"Very average crankset. I dont go hard on trails, I use my bike primarily on pavement. Seems of sturdy construction. No complaints.You get what you paid for, no frills, good construction."
3,The only Jann Arden's dissapointing CD.,"I'm a fan of Jann, and because of this I considered ""Good Mother"" her only dissapointing CD. I was very happy when I knew that a new CD of Jann was on sale. Since I was unable to find in Amazon which the tracks of this CD were, I believed that it had new songs. To my dissapointment I found out that this CD contained 4 previously released tracks. You know, I have the complete collection of Jann's CDs. For this reason, although all others Jann's releases deserve a 5-star rating, Good Mother deserves only a 3-star rating, if not less. I really feel sorry for giving one of Jann Arden CDs such a low rating. I wish I could have given ""Good Mother"" a 5-star rating too.I wish I knew why producers do such things. Maybe, it's a silly question because I think I know the answer: to sell more! Nevertheless, they should always let people know the tracks on a CD, so that one doesn't by it ""blindly"", and thus avoiding receiving ""surprises""."
4,One of Mr. Collins' Best,"This album is one of Phil's best. It exibits all that is Phil Collins. I am especially pleased with the song ""Lorenzo"" The story behind that song is inspiring. Lorenzo is a man that is living with ALD (Adrenoleukodystrophy). Before him, every boy that had had this genetic disorder had died within two years of diagnosis, mostly before the age of ten. Lorenzo's parents invented an oil which stops the debilitation of the disease, but does not reverse that damage that is already done. These parents fought for their boy who is still alive today (He's 23). Michaela and Augosto (Lorenzo's parents) wrote the lyrics to this song for Lorenzo. It is truly inspiring and adds to this album."
5,Best Overall Sound,"This is tied with 'But Seriously' as my favorite Phil Collins. As with many of his albums, the songs that made it big on the radio don't compare to the hidden gems that you find only when you buy the CD. ""Love Police"" blew me away the first time I heard it, it instantly became my favorite song of all time. The lyrics lay it all on the line and the music is almost hypnotic. ""The Same Moon"" has the most beautiful and haunting tune and lyrics, even better than ""Father to Son"" on ""But Seriously"". ""No Matter Who"" and ""You Oughta Know By Now"" are also excellent. This album introduces a new sound for him that is very smooth, lyrical, and as with all his music, dynamic."
3,Dance into the Light,Dance into the Light being Collins 1996 release and his 6th studio album and is an ok album. Collins seems to be running out of ideas on this album. The sound that made him famous in the 80's is not there. The lyrics are not as strong as one previous efforts. Dance into the light is a pretty good track but if one thinks of his past efforts it falls short. The book-let is atrocious. Collins looks odd to say the least. The clothes are so ugly. The book-let is filled with odd photographs that look like some kid had fun with photoshop. His rendition of the times are a-changin is alright but Collins version is nowhere as strong as the original. 3/5.
4,PHIL IS BACK !!!,"""Both sides"" was really big step down, but Phil reminds us that he still didn't lost IT. It deserves 4 and 1/2 stars. The best song is ""wear my hat"" to me...it's funny, it really puts a smile on your face. Title song is also great. I pesonally like 2nd part of album. In 80'es Phil was big star 'cause of his own albums and 'cause he gave us many great albums with Genesis. But in 90'es he dissappear. This is only album from 90'es that he shows us that he is still here...that he is happy, crazy and funny like always. Great album. There is easy listening like ""the same moon"" and uptempo songs like ""river so wide"". I love this album. I you like Phil, buy this one."
3,lorenzo,"this is not really a review i would like more information regarding the song written by mickela odone and what the song really means. My son who is 4 now was diagnosed with adrenoleukodystrophy in november last year at the age of three.I would love to know more about the song. I know mickela has passed away and I hope that i can continue the search and love for my children who are both affected with this disease so that i may enjoy them in a healthy state for a lifetime.Mickela thank you for all your hard work and care for lorenzo i know how tough this can be.Jamie Balow, mother of an ALD child."
2,Phil please go back and play with Genesis,"This record really shows that Phil Collins has lost his sense for true rock music as on 'But Seriously'...I think that he should rejoin Genesis as a drummer or co-singer with Ray Wilson...Calling all Stations is at least 10 times better than this boring Phil Collins soft pop album...What are the tracks 2,5 and 7 standing for...soft radio pop"
2,A bit better,With more of an expiramental ege and less of a bad pop sheen then Phil Collins general fare Dance Into The Light is a 2 1/2 star album. Theres still a cover here and weak ballads and Phil did not even cowrite the lyrics of Lorenzo but theres some largly african world music here paralleling this album with (the much better music artist) Peter Gabriels Security and actually a few good songs.
1,Stay Away From This Light(Album),"Phil Collins at his worst ""Dance Into The Light"" is awful. The title song is a joke and sounded very forced, like he rushed to make and bring out a song from the subpar album. The single ""Dance Into The Light"" has no rhythm much less a hook. If people thought his album ""Both Sides"" was bad and I am not one of them, then this album will make the think again, when was the last time a Phil Collins album only produced one song. The thing that is a shame about this album is ""It's In Your Eyes"" a song that could have done well if it was a follow up to a bad song, and wasn't released right away. This album is a far cry from the ""...But Seriously"", ""No Jacket Required"" days. ""Dance Into The Light"" is one of the worst albums I own, and I own some bad ones, thank goodness Phil redeemed himself with ""You'll Be In My Heart"" from ""Tarzan"". Phil will release better material than ""Dance Into The Light"" let's hope, from one of the best male voices in music."
1,More like Dance Into a Fight,"I'm sorry, but even though I like Phil Collins, I heard that this album wasn't the big thing (it was a slump). My recommendation: get ""No Jacket Required,"" ""Seriuos Hits...Live!,"" or ""Hits"" instead."
1,garbage,"I'm sick of white musicians singing about black experiences.What does Phil know about being black? He's lost it!Please take a cue from Billy Joel.At least he knows when to give it up!I guess I will always go back and listen to Phil Pre Both Sides,because his last great solo effort was But Seriously some ten years ago."
4,Dance into the light or dark with this album,"DANCE INTO THE LIGHT was not much more successful then 1993's BOTH SIDES. The title track and IT'S IN YOUR EYES were the only hits from this album. But this album does continue to sell otherwise it wouldn't be advertised on this site. Phil covers Bob Dylan's THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN,previously covered by Peter Paul & Mary,Simon & Garfunkel and Billy Joel. Phil tells another story on this album entitled JUST ANOTHER STORY. It tells about an abusive drunkard and his family. This album is pretty cool."
3,The Deal,I'll keep it simple. In my opinion:GoodIt's in your eyes (personal favorite)That's what you saidThe times they are....All of the other songs are about average. I might not be so hard on the CD if I hadn't heard a lot better from Phil Collins before this album and after. He is one of the greatest artists of all time but this is not one of his greatest CDs.
4,"Hey, it's got No Matter Who...","And Lorenzo, and Just Another Story, and... even if ya don't like the other songs, which aren't even taht bad, buy it for the 3 I named."
2,What's Rome got to do with this?,"Why, oh why would you write a novel where your main character is a complete and unredeeming idiot?!This book was very disappointing: the plot was too predictable (I guess for everyone but the heroine), Rome comes and goes and has very little presence so it's most definitely not a novel of piazzas (nor it is of passion); and the characters were uninteresting and lack depth.So, as someone has already said it's a complete BLAH! I guess if you are 15 years old and being forced to visit cousins in a lost town in the middle of nowhere... or maybe you have a totally self-obsessed friend and want to send her a hint, well this is your book."
2,Not Quite Rome,"I thought chick lit portrays women to be empowered with brains, wit and to be upwardly mobile.However, the female protaganist turns out to be bird brained. She can't think logically, I keep tut tutting what a dim wit she is. She does not even have any intuition to process about what men say to her, strange as she is a woman. I guess there are some men in the real world who love bird brains like her and those who like witty women.The title is a misnomer. Less than one quarter of the book is devoted to the physical location, Rome city itself. The plot unfolds mainly in London. I thought the author could do better by weaving the bulk of the plot thru Rome's landmarks of which there are plenty, social scene of which it is very vibrant and local Roman characters which I am sure she can draw a wealth of Italian personalities to elaborate on.Not entirely an engaging novel. I thought ""Weekend in Paris"" by Robyn Sisman does more justice to its title by basing the plot in Paris."
2,a waste of time,"A very predictable story. I wish there had been more of the story taking place in Rome as the title implies. It is more about her job, boyfriend(s) and the trouble one can get into by not telling the whole truth. A few humerous bits, but not worth reading the whole book to find them."
3,predictable plot...,"Plot too predictable. Ex-boyfriend turns up unexpectedly into her life again & almost mess up her whole world. Ending too predictable too. Ex-boyfriend gone, can`t hurt her an inch, still back in the arms of trusty current boyfriend who loved her so much that she didn`t expected him to be this `Interesting`... Nice cover though"
2,Utterly Predictable,"This is one of those unfortunate books where you may not like the main character, Georgie Beauchamp, as I didn't. It seemed at various times throughout the plot, she was so dense to reality, you literally wanted to kick some sense into her."
2,Skip Rome,"Warning: You will wade through pages and pages, and more pages, of Georgie's shallow inner-monologue (and little else) before she gets anywhere near Italy. There are many, many boring descriptions of her workplace and how she ""cleverly"" avoids making any sort of contribution there. Her boyfriend has to be the world's biggest fool and her ex-boyfriend has no redeeming qualities whatsoever--so instead of loving to hate him, you just end up hating him. It may have also been nice if the author could have thought of a word other than ""smart"" to describe everything.I gave this two stars because I laughed a couple of times. But overall, this book was a major disappointment."
3,Predictable but sweet,"Was a nice read. The plot and characters where the same familiar ones as several other stories, but if it's on a deal there are worse versions out there."
3,Silly and predictable.... but....,"I kinda enjoyed reading this one. It was a little silly.... and it was definitely predictable.... but I still found it engaging and entertaining for the most part. I read it in one day and thought it was a cute story. As others have noted, there's not a lot of ""Rome"" to be had in this story, but there were a lot of ""Roman Holiday"" references.The main character - Georgie - is kind of an airhead, yet something about her innocence appealed to me. I honestly didn't think the plot was all that bad - just predictable. It was quick and cute - just don't read it with hopes of a true Italian experience! I'll definitely pick up another Gemma Townley novel in the future."
3,"Very cutesy book, nice read","If you're looking for a romantic comedy in book format, this is what you want."
4,Sweet Chick-Lit,"This book is one of the few books that I've managed to read in two days and it's obvious to see why- it's a real page turner. Gemma Townley writes with a unique style of writing that is cute, sweet, adorable, and funny. I found myself really imagining Georgie was a co-worker or everyday friend of mine. I fell in love with David Georgie's over-protective, secretive, and sensitive boyfriend and personally I wouldn't mind spending a weekend in Rome with him!Don't be fooled by the title the major part of the story takes place in London but, the weekend Georgie spends in Rome changes everything in her life for the better-I love this book and continually re-read certain passages particilarly the parts in Rome or Georgie's interactions with her ex-Mike(who seems just as villanious as Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones).All in all this a good read for a chick that enjoys romantic comedic chick-lit."
1,Not Worth The Money,"I hated this book. It was very predictable, you knew everything that was going to happen. I hated the main character, Georgie, she was so stupid; no one in their right mind would do the things she does in the book. If I could have given this book 0 stars I would have."
1,Another Story About a Stupid Woman,"Why do some writers think they can base their novels on a brainless woman? Their target audience (women, I assume) is supposed to find such main characters inspiring?"
2,Surprisingly Disappointing,"I love Rome and like this genre, so I was prepared to be enchanted by When In Rome... Instead I was disappointed by the main character, whose immaturity and lack of perspective ruined the book for me. The ex-boyfriend's character was extremely one-dimensional, making it impossible to understand why the heroine would want him back. Yet the current boyfriend's character is portrayed as near perfect, making the heroine's actions baffling to the reader. If the characters had been multi-faceted, the ensuing course of events might have been involving. Instead this attempted mad-cap adventure stubles before it gets of the ground."
4,"If you like chick lit, you'll like this book","If you like the chick lit genre and books like Bridget Jones and the Shopaholic series, you will probably like this book. When in Rome opens with twenty-something Londoner Georgie, running into to her ex-boyfriend Mike one rainy day and follows her as she leaves London (and her lovely boyfriend) for a trip to Rome with Mike. While I sometimes shook my head at Georgie's choices, the book kept me so entertained that I read it in one sitting on a long train trip.Gemma Townley has written a witty, fast paced first novel and I will definitely pick up her next book."
5,I liked this book!,"Although this book is not a literary masterpiece, it is a feel-good story. The story may have been a bit predictable but there is a cute and fluffy plot. I finished the book with a smile and feeling better about life."
2,I agree w/ the others - very predictable!,"The only reason why I borrowed this book from the library was because I heard of a movie being made called ""When in Rome"" starring Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel. Partway through, I realized they are not related at all. The main character is dim-witted, nave, lazy, and annoying. She has no moral values, no work ethic, and is a horrendous girlfriend and friend. It was fairly easy to predict what was going to happen throughout the story. The only reason why I kept reading was because I adored David's character. He is my absolute dream man!!! I was also expecting more from Sophie Kinsella's sister, but I won't let this book stop me from reading another Gemma Townley novel. I'm giving her another chance."
1,The Roman Adventure That Wasn't,"I picked this up hoping for a reminder of my vacation in beatiful Rome. The ""Roman Holiday"" lasted all of 63 pages of this 308 page book. It touts itself as ""A Novel of Piazzas and Passion"" but is very sadly lacking in both. This is an average story about the intriguing world of accounting (?!?) and corporate mergers set in dreary London offices. Looking for a real Italian adventure? Look elsewhere!(I would recommend Belinda Jones' ""I Love Capri"")"
5,Great smelling spray,"Got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. The fact that it's a spray will hopefully ensure that it stretches longer. Great smell, worth the splurge for yourself or your guy."
1,ITS FAKE!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,"Its fake, do not buy!!!You cannot return this product once you receive it.I have been using armani code for years and as soon as i opened the box, i realized this was fake, not genuine product.Scent is awful and when i contacted seller about this, they did nothing.Now i am left with garbage product, dont waste your money."
2,Powdery fragrance,"This stuff smells like the powder that your barber or hairdresser brushes on your neck after a trim. It's a discriminating taste thing for sure but I'm not remotely impressed and doubt I would wear it. My girlfriend was equally unimpressed I will likely re-gift it if I can find someone that appreciates scent. It the type of thing I would use for funeral, not I night on the town and certainly not to look for a woman. It's very popular with stellar reviews, my guess with men over 55 though. To be fair though I hate that powdery smell on a man or a woman many people find it pleasing."
4,Armani Cod3,This men's fragrance has an excellent scent. I've used Armani fragrances in the past and have really enjoyed using them.
3,great smell,Does not last as long.. just as everyone has been saying.. But great smell. very close to the 212 . I do a mix of both.
1,Fake,"Was so disappointed! Gave it to my boyfriend for Christmas. Noticed that when he would use it, the smell would disappear quickly. I would definitely say, that this product was not the real stuff. I would buy at the store from now on."
4,great smell!,"Love this stuff, It has a great smell! My wife loves it too, but the only thing I dont like is that the smell seems to ware off very quickly. Even when I use alot, the smell wears off in a couple hours. But other than that, it's great!"
5,Don't leave home without it!!!,Forget about wearing anything else. Armani Blue with a little Otis Redding will make for a memorable night. Trust me!!!
1,I'm dissaponted,Armani Code By Giorgio Armani For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5 Ounces perfume disappointed me. It is not strong and its odor last for a short time. It is the worst I have.
1,I received a copy of the fragrance!!!,"To my surprise I received a cheap copy of the fragrance CODE from Armani. I got suspiscious when I unpacked because the plastic was thicker than usual. I then opened the box, which smelled strong and weird. It had linked in the box. Looking at the bottle and its cap I realized that the bottle and the cap were all scratched. Also, the word ""CODE"" was not written in pure white, it was more like a beige, which is usually a sign of copied product. A bit despaired, I took the bottle to a parfum shop to compare the odor with another CODE. It was obviously different!I then wrote to the Amazon and the seller who wrote me back quickly and were very sorry about my bad luck. The seller asked me to send the bottle back and promised a full refund. He will works it out with his supplier.I know many people are happy with their purchase (that's why I decided to give internet a try), I guessed I was just unlucky?!"
2,Watered Down Cologne?,I have bought Armani colognes from department stores in the past and they were all great. The scent stayed on for the entire day after you wore the cologne in the morning.I bought Armani Code and a couple of other colognes from Amazon and they all seemed to be watered down. I noticed the difference immediately after wearing them and the smell didn't last for even a couple of hours. I won't buy colognes from Amazon and rather stick with department stores such as Macy's.
1,Not a fan,I bought this for my husband and its not a keeper! The scent is way to strong.. Almost overwhelming! It's not a sexy scent at all.
4,Smells Great!,"Am very pleased with Armani Code. Though I must admit, it smells great, but I am confused because in some places it is titled Black Code and in others it is just Code. This review is for Black Code, but my bottle just says Code. Did I get what I ordered? I don't know!"
1,Mrs. M,"HORRIBLE!!!!!! It is not the real thing. I am shocked that they can sell this on Amazon. I am honestly reconsidering ordering anything from here. It looked legit, but once my husband opened the bootleg product he realized that the word CODE was stickers that came right off. It doesn't even smell like it.. I am furious. DO NOT PURCHASE this product unless you have tons of $ and just like giving money away to crooks."
2,Watered-down Armani Code,"I know what Code smells like, and what I got was notan authentic bottle of Armani Code. Please beware ofthis dishonest seller.The packaging is real enough, but the product is phony."
5,Armani code is perfect for me,"Armani code is perfect for me. Neither all perfume suits everyone nor everyone has similar taste. I don't recommend to buy any perfume just based on online review. Make sure your try a perfume before buying. I love this perfume and it lasts long time on me, almost entire working hours. If you love to try many perfumes you should give it a try, if you are planning for regular use, try it before buying."
1,Something Is Wrong,"After reading other reviews on this product, I believe that something is wrong with mine as well. This is not the Armani Mania I remember. The smell is way off and the product does not last. Maybe there is a storage problem or something. I would hope that this is not intentional. Waste of money for me."
1,Up to 55%? Why do you need to lie?,"Your title says that ""Mens Designer Cologne by Giorgio Armani, ( BLACK CODE EAU DE TOILETTE SPRAY 4.2 oz + On Sale ) - @Up To 55% Off"" but the price is 58 dollars. Since a regular price at a retail is around $85, you discounted the price by 35%. Let me know when the price will be dropped down by 55%; otherwise, why waste everyone's time and give a false information? Are you hoping that people won't do the math and notice?"
1,Waste of Money ..! Smells like after shave lotion ..!,"I just bought this yesterday through amazon, I am not sure if this is original or not, but it just smells like after shave lotion and dosent last long. Package and other things are all fine.Dont buy this if you are looking for some thing special.Dont buy this if you dont want to waste your money.A cheap after shave lotion smells better than this."
5,Perfect,"Fits me perfect (The women say so). Not so strong but not too light. It is my favorite cologne out there right now. Just spray it twice and the scent lasts forever, no lie. I recommend it and give it a 10 out of 10. I've given it as a present to my brother in law in his late 30's and father in his early 50's and both loved it, as well as their wives. I'm in my early 20's by the way so i'd say every age group loves it."
3,Pretty Alright,"It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I don't mind it at all. It's a pretty good scent, but I prefer Ralph Lauren's ""Romance."""
4,Great casual scent for men,Excellent value for a very nice casual sent for men. Light and slightly musky scent. Nice bottle. Very well suited for men.
1,Smells like strong cinnamon,"I read the good reviews about this cologne and decided to get it for my husband as a gift. I never smelled the scent, so I was taking a chance. After wearing it, he smelled like sweet cooking spice. We thought maybe the smell would die down, so he went to work with it on. He said that people kept asking who was wearing cinnamon scented cologne while he was there. He knew it was him, but he didn't say anything...LOL! I don't like it because of the constant smell of cinnamon spice which reminds me of strong Big Red gum. I kept getting queasy, so we just decided to throw it away. Maybe his body chemistry just didn't go with it. Overall, If you like the smell of pumpkin pies on your skin, then I would suggest this. If not, do not buy this scent. And from now on when it comes to scents, I will have to sniff before buying."
3,Armani Mania not the greatest..!!..,I work with a woman who bought this cologne for her husband and said it was the best thing she smelled since I farted..haha...just kidding. She did say that she loves the smell of the cologne. I purchased it off of Amazon and I was not crazy about it and my wife wasnt either. I sold it on ebay to try and get my money back.
2,Armani Doublemint,"Guys, remember: your mileage may vary. You always want to try a scent on your skin to get an idea of how well it'll work: the scents react with your own to produce the final result.That said, I thought I'd be buying myself a bottle of this today...until I tested it. It hit me strong with a masculine reek that then settled into what seemed like a milder form of Drakkar (a personal favorite). Unfortunately, after a few minutes it seemd to transform on me, smelling like some bizarre minty, candy-like fragrance.If you want bang for your buck, this might also be called ""Eternity: the last fragrance you'll ever need""--it's been 8 hours, I've been swimming, had a hot shower, and I can still smell it. The nozzle kind of saturation-bombs you with a tap. ;)"
4,"Predictable, popular, pleasant",This scent is becoming more and more popular. Almost ever guy I know has owned this once before which takes away the prestige.it's almost immediately noticeable. Overall the ladies still love it even though someone else will most likely have it on everywhere you go. lol
4,a good code,"This cologne has a very pleasant, masculine aroma. After looking for it locally & online, I bought it at Amazon at a very reasonable price. I recommend you try it!"
1,Obvious Counterfeit,"The box had white strips in it, the barcode was taped over and the bottle smells like aftershave. All around a true fake. Don't bother."
2,broken item,"When i received it , it was broken. The box of parfume was wet. I lost some amount of it."
3,took forever to get it,"it took forever to get it, i thing they dot it deliverly for you to pay the extra money for expedite services"
5,Absolute classic,"Powerful and long-lasting fragrance, wear when you want to be noticed. I discovered this from a roomie I had when I studied abroad in Latin America a couple of years ago. I have been in love with it since then. Can't go wrong!"
2,Too much hype.,"I bought two bottles because I thougth women will be crazy about the smell. Why would I think that way? Reviews from all over the web. Nobody ever asked me what I am wearing when I used it. Nevertheless, the jet black bottles are cool to look at."
4,Great Product,"I'm very pleased with this product thus far. The level of detail is sufficient to track my training progress without overwhelming me with trivial details. I think it will become more usual once Garmin uses Firefox as its brower of choice. This will let those of us who have Macs and don't use IE 6.0 to take advantage of the analyser options.The unit is rugged holds up to rain and cool temps well. After two hours in steady downpour, I was convinced that I had drowned it, but there was no adverse affects whatsoever. I would caution users to make sure the rubber seal that covers the cable port is firmly set in place or you run the risk of water getting inside under wet road conditions.If you have the bucks and like tracking your speed, altitude, etc., buy it."
4,watch out for refurbished units sold as new,"At least one dishonest Amazon vendor (Buy Accessories) is selling overhauled/refurbished units as new. Play it safe and only buy from Amazon itself.Other than that, it looks great; have not used it yet. Buy a USB emergency battery charger for longer trips. APC has several good ones:http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=314&ISOCountryCode;=us"
4,Garmin Edge 205 tracks just about everything,"The Garmin Edge 205 is a great addition to any bicycle. It has worked greatfrom day one so my few complaints are minor ones. First, I wish the displaywas a little bit brighter because when you wear tinted lens it is sometimesnot as easy to read the display. Second, as with most GPS receivers, thebattery time is not very long. What I mean by that is that normal bike computers batteries last for months, while the Garmin Edge the charge is only good for hours(12 maximum). Third, I wish there was a wrist strap so when you get off your bike to run, you could take it with you instead of having to switch to something else.Considering all the factors, I'm glad I got the Garmin Edge...maybe I shouldhave gotten the Garmin Edge 305!!"
4,Good value,"I've used the Garmin 205 for three weeks and haven't had the problems that previous reviewers indicated. Don't know if it comes down to the individual variability of each unit, but distance and speed have been dead on accurate as compared to the Signa. The altimeter is another matter. As indicated by others, the altimeter reading fluctuates wildly. Standing still in my garage it climbed from 200 to 400, then back down to 100. The other quibble is the size and illumination of the display. If you wear dark sunglasses (a must in California)the display is very difficult to read. But other features are quite useful and enjoyable. If you are a solo rider who repaetedly rides the same route, the race against yourself features break up the monotomy. All in all, I'm pleased with this product."
3,Warning! Not for Type IV motors!!,"A large number of air cooled Volkswagen's used the Volkswagen type air cooled IV motor, such as 411's, 412's and '1972 and newer buses. The Porsche 912E and 914 used the Type IV also, but in fairness they are not technically ""Volkswagens"" but they are Volkswagen motors.This book does not cover the type IV motor at all, and you wouldn't know it until you paid for it and read it.So, it does not cover all air cooled Volkswagens as the name suggests, only the older bug/bus upright motors, and squarebacks.So it's worthless to me since I have a 1974 air cooled Volkswagen bus with a type IV motor.And as others have noted, it's quite outdated."
3,"Great Info, but Kindle Version Needs to Improve","This is a classic cooking reference co-written by probably the most famous American cook ever, Julia Child. While it contains a good amount of useful information, I find that the Kindle version of most cookbooks are lacking due to very few hyperlinks. Searching for a specific piece of information, e.g., the right temperature for potatoes, is an absolute bear."
5,Mastering the Art of French Cooking,I really like this cookbook. There are all kinds of cool recipes and I can't wait to try all of them. It's just like being a real Chef.
5,great gift for newly weds,"i purchased these books for my new daughter in law, she is going to love them"
4,A note on the index.,"An earlier reviewer gave this item one star because they thought the index was useless. The Index in volume two is an index for both volumes. I believe the previous reviewer misunderstood that. For example the Mushroom Appetizer recipe they were looking for says ""I: 202"" meaning volume 1, page 202. This may have confused the reviewer but it is not a defect in the book.On another note the book is well bound so it should last for many years of kitchen use."
5,Nice reference,I like the emphasis on technique rather than on recipes. I wish I could found more books like this.
4,Good but not as good as Vol 1.,"I have used the Vol 1 of Julia's book multiple times but don't find this second volume to be as useful. Still, she does have some excellent tips and recipes that I've yet to use so maybe in time it will grow on me. Volume 1 is still the best."
1,Cheese Spreader-Cats,"I particularly wanted these items as I love cats and I purchases another set for a dear friend for her birthday ( The parcel did not arrive in time as it was shipped to Canada in error. Photo on website 1,000 better than the real thing. Cheap plastic rubbish. I seen better. Not worth the money. Am extremely disappointed with the product, the seller, the seller and the delivery time. I will not be shopping with this supplier again."
5,Family Guy,I love my Family Guy toy's they are easily to handle not to big or not to small they are the perfect toy because my favorite type of toy is the kind you can hold in your hands and play with. They are just absolutely perfect for a nine year old to play with and enjoy them.
4,FUN,"My daughter who is 7 years old plays with these. They are well made and very durable. Not too bendable thou. You can bend the arms a little and that's about it, but she likes them."
4,Privileged Interviews Post WW2,"The Author's wonderful opportunity to interview German generals post WW 2 has allowed him to illuminate both strengths and weaknesses of the leadership of the Wehrmacht and its' use of strategy and tactics. Early portions of the book deal with the rise of Hitler and how the miltary leadership dealt with this (or didn't!). Their is no doubt that naivety and/or complacense on the part of the german military heirarchy allowed for Hitler's increasing control of the military. Discussion of the players of the game and how they fared both in a battle sense and in dealing with an increasingly mercurial Hitler are well covered. The book has an easy readability, but seems more aimed at a general audience rather than military enthusiasts. For historical purposes, it is landmark piece that shouldn't be missed, but it lacks the in depth coverage that I hoped it would possess - you must look elsewhere for this."
2,OK but dated,For a serious student of military theory or history this presents few new insights today.However it is always interesting to get yet another take on familiar subjects and events.I would have liked more outtakes from Liddell Hart's interviews with the generals and less of his synthesis.
4,Not so startling... today!,"Yeah, pretty true! The ""startling revelations"" have become current knowledge. Anyway this is the value of the book: it has made the history, as we know it. The revelations are today no more startling... this means that the book is really ok.Here you can still find the facts and the events, as you already know them (or as you should actually know them!), directly described with the words of the main actors.A very good work, shame it's not so detailed: a thousand page book would have fit better the case!A request to the editor: please change the cover - it's an historical nonsense!"
3,Recommended For Critical Readers of History Only,"Liddell-Hart had an absolutely unique opporunity of interviewing a number of Wermacht general officers during their incarceration. Their commentary is, in the main, candid. However, one must beware of their validation of some of Liddell-Hart's theories of warfare.As is the case with any historical work, one should endeavor to substantiate, by comparison with other authoritative sources, any information presented."
3,AKA Ninja Ball,"I bought them thinking it would stand out better than a white ball, I don't know what I was thinking. I hit some of the best drives and iron shots with these balls but lost all of them in one round of 18. If you don't get them on the Fairway, you might as well hit another. Hence the name ""Ninja Ball"" They flew straight and true but they like to go into hiding. Now you see them, now you don't kinda of thing. If you don't have perfect vision, forget about it."
2,Neutron Golf Balls,"I was disappointed in the performance of the balls on this purchase. They did not perform as well it seemed. I noticed the structure and color of the lime green High Visibility ball had changed from a bright solid color to more of a Crystal color, which no mention was made of this. I tried them and was disappointed. My last box was just ordered."
2,DO NOT ORDER!! TOO SMALLL!,This thing is the size of a quarter! I wanted something about an inch or an inch-and-a-half wide that people can actually see and comment on!It is tiny and easily overlookable! RIP OFF!
4,Showing a lot of promise,"Van She's debut EP has given me hope for new music to come. There have been a few bands in recent who've picked up on the retro vibe in little bits, like The Birthday Massacre, but Van She are full blown 80's retro. Kelly has to be one of the best songs I've heard in 15 years or more, and if it were 1985, this song would have taken the airwaves by storm. Combining every influence from the Police, a Flock of Seagulls, and the Psychedelic Furs, Van She is a sure hit with anyone who grew up listening to the best music ever made, 80's rock. Sex City is my other favorite track on this EP. It has a very Police-esque vibe about it. I would definately recommend this EP to 80's fans, it is something to get excited about. Remember when good music was played on the radio and MTV?? This may trigger some long lost feelings. Can't wait to hear more from these guys."
2,Terrible,"The acting is even worse than the image/video quality of this movie, which is the worse I have ever seen.inaccurate , boring"
1,Don't Bother,"This book attempts to be an all in one source for your post-partum recovery. While it does cover everything from breastfeeding problems to losing weight to burping your baby, it's not done well. It tries to cover too much information in too short of a book, the result is a lot of subjects, but not a lot of subastance. It's probably better to get a separate book on breastfeeding (Dr. Sear's Breastfeeding book and the Breastfeeding Answer Book by La Leche League are excellent), a separate book on baby care, etc... I even found the post-partum section in ""What to Expect the First Year"" to be more informative and helpful than in ""Bouncing Back After Your Pregnancy"". Incidentally, ""What to Expect the First Year"" is another excellent source for baby care issues, it's far more in-depth than this particular book. I'm so glad I checked this out at the library rather than buying it, the cover of this book has a lot of appeal, it's just too bad the content doesn't match."
4,A good resource Guide,"I haven't had my baby yet but I've got lots of time on my hands to read so I picked up this book - and I found it to be very encouraging and informative. I recommend reading it while you are pregnant so you know what to expect. As to the other reviews, quite frankly I don't ""get"" why people keep recommending 'What To Expect When You're Expecting"". I found it to be very poorly written - plus a recent article in the New York Times called it outdated, incorrect and said that most doctors don't recommend it or approve of it. At least Bouncing Back speaks to pregnant women as if we have a brain - which is more than I can say for ""What To Expect!"" !Buy Bouncing Back - it's not new, but you'll like it!"
5,Better than I remembered!,"I first read this book many years ago courtesy of the public library. I fell in love with the works of Charlotte MacLeod, and so I was delighted when I found out Amazon had the book used, in good condition, for such a reasonable price! If you haven't read the series before, get thee to a library and give it a try! Re-reading Vane Pursuit is like a visit from an old friend, with the addition that I now ""get"" many more of the little literary jokes and references sprinkled through the text. Book was in condition described, slightly worn and yellowed but no marks on inside pages and apparently comes from a smoke-free place. Would I buy again? In a heartbeat!"
4,"Excelente guía, muy recomendable","Excelente guía, la más completa para orientarte calle por calle en un lugar tan exótico y multicultural como lo es Singapore; un magnífico artículo de viaje para explorar esta nación isla."
4,Great sounding tubes,I installed these in my JCA20H along with the preamp tubes and they sound great. The only problem is that they did not match exactly so one is a lot hotter than the other one. I don't think it matters that much as long as they don't burn out quickly. I like the overall tone which beats the Chinese made tubes that came with the amp. I might consider buying JJ EL84's if these blow due to other reviews but hopefully these will last me a while.
4,Tube order,"Sovtek tubes are a reliable low cost option for replacement in tube guitar amps. these were shipped and received quickly, packaged well and worked as advertised."
5,Proper!,"What great light bulbs! How does one praise the beleaguered incandescent bulb? This future relic is just as advertised. Effective, beautiful and elegant, this bulb will give one pause when contemplating the history of the humble glass encased wire of glowing electricity. Each night this product calls to all who seek the security of home, shining forth the call to comfort through the cruel, frightening darkness."
5,EXCELLENT therapy for Autism,My 3 year old son was just diagnosed with Autism. My mother bought him the Bounce dvds and he just loves them. He has only watched them a few times and he is singing the songs throughout the day without being prompted. The music is simple and not annoying and the whole dvd holds his attention very well. I really think that these are a wonderful source of therapy because of the music and the way they word the songs! This comes HIGHLY recommended and if I could give it more stars I would!!!
5,a biogaraphy of a good man,"Reading this book will bring back many memories for anyone who knewClarence either first hand or by reputation. For others who simply have experienced Adirondack adventures, it may inspire a sense of awe that one man could accomplish so much."
3,"Interesting, but flawed","While Ossendowski's books remains in print it should be approached with caution as much of it is fantasy. Not long after it was published its veracity was challenged by none other than Sven Hedin, the famous explorer, who suggested that it was unlikely that Ossendowski had done much of what he claimed. Despite that, it makes interesting reading, but should not be treated as reliable."
3,not that impressed,When I bought this single I thought that I was buying the other DLMBTLTK Pt.2 with the album version and two mixes of stronger instead this only had the album version of DLMBTLTK and one mix of OIDIA that I already had and one mix of stronger that I already. It has the video of DLMBTLTK which is only able to play on mac computer....
2,"Not Grau's classic film, however this one ain't bad...","Tread with caution, this film is NOT Jorge Grau's Countess Bathory film 'Legend of Blood Castle', it's actually a Spanish / Italian co-production called 'Ivanna' and was released in the Netherlands as 'Castle of Blood'. If you were expecting Grau's film, then you'll be dissapointed (as I was.)Still, 'Ivanna' isn't that bad at all, although the print isn't too much of an improvement on the 20 year old dutch tape."
3,Its .. ok,"I read all the other reviews saying how this music box falls apart easy. So I bought it thinking I would not let my 3 year old play with it like a toy. Well, I was taking it out of the box, Puting her things in the drawer in the back. It broke. I had it 5 min. and it is broken. Now I wish I did not get it. On the up side, She just Loves it."
1,Itsy Bitsy!,"The music box should come with a warning label: Item enlarged to show details. The music box itself is quite small. The storage space is virtually non-existant. I originally bought it as a gift for my niece, but needless to say, she never received it. I returned it because it barely had the capacity to hold anything molded larger than a ring. (No room for bangles here!)"
5,Baby Anne Rocks!,"Get ready to set your player to ""Continuous Play""! This CD is a 1:07:53 stream of steady rockin' breakbeats! Mixing 2 of her own tracks (""I Wanna Rock"") and (""London Blue""), with tracks by DJ Icey (""Joystick""), Krafty Kuts (""Basketball Jam""), Future Funk Squad (""Sorcerary""), ATF (""Rock The Beat"") and four of this genre's other great musical masterminds, the beats are rollin' non-stop. You won't want to miss this one, it's definately some of Baby Anne's very best work!"
4,how the cause saves the case,"Tibetan issue is of big importance and _that_ makes this album worth attention - not the performers' escapades. A few Tibetan tracks are very nice and (supposedly, will be) interesting for western folks. The CD-ROM part of this project merits a separate edition - especially the collection of thangkas!"
2,Not worth it,"This triple album, unless you want to support the freedom of the Tibet, is not really worth buying. For a three disc set, it only has as much as one disc's worth of acceptable good music, which you probably can get on iTunes individually."
2,I tried to like it,"She's been blessed is a novel based on Sabrina Brown's real life. Sabrina is a young lady who gives up college, and a good husband, because she see's two prositutes, and thinks they have the good life. So, through out the whole book, she a high class prostitute, who never feels shame about what she's doing, as long as she's making the money. All of a sudden in the last few chapters she decides to become a chrisitan. My problem with the book is that I don't think Sabrina ever throught she was in the wrong for being a prostitue, she seem to be having a good time the whole book. If you like to see how a high class prostitue live, you will probably like the book."
3,Not bad.,"This video is 1999 NASCAR season review.Commentary and interview is good.But, very very short race scene.(1 race time is 20sec-1-2min)Because all 34 races in this tape.Not bad.Lastly sorry.I speak bad English."
2,75% wasted paper. Save a tree.,"Let's see. 5 or 6 languages in one book. Generally books are printed in a single language at a time with altnerative language versions available. Then the tabs. You cannot play classical music from tabs. This is not two-fingered power chorts in over-driven, clipped, electric rock and roll. So, regardless of one's native language, about 75% of this book is a waste. Even if you do play from tabs then the notation is a waste to you. If you really read music then the tabs are a waste. Yes, you can get some fingering or position tips from the tabs but that takes about one hint in a piece so the rest is completely wasted ink. And a serious distraction when trying to pl ay.As generally happens when anyone or anything tries to be all things to all people, they fail miserably. Mel Bay needs to get back to their roots and provide real music books."
4,Change of Heart,This is a moving true story. I was not impressed with AndrewMcCarthy in the movie. I think they could have found a better actor. It was nice to see Michael Learned in the role as an employee of the adoptive agency. Since she will always be remembered as 'Olivia Walton'.It was nice to see her playing a different role and doing a nice job. This movie will have you crying both tears of sadness and joy.Highly Recommend it.
4,A very good movie!,"I enjoy movies that are based on a true story, which this movie is. My whole family enjoyed it very much. I like Andrew McCarthy in movies. He played in the movie ""The Christmas Tree"" which has never been produced on vhs or dvd yet. I wish whoever owns the rights to that movie would release it on dvd. I know it would be a big hit. I saw and recorded the movie when it was on tv many years ago."
3,Good movie: Better Chic flick!!,"I grew up in a big city. I was confused, beguiled, and tried to do the right things. This move shouldn't and didn't win any awards. Yet, how many good moves never do. Its a nice love story of teens growing up trying to do the right thing. being in love for gays only creates more problems for the estab lishment. :(.. See it. This shouldnt even have a *R* rating."
1,A Total Waste of Time,"This movie was dreadful. I kept waiting and waiting for the plot to thicken, however it didn't. The plot, if there even was one, was extremely poorly developed. If you want to see a true movie about love and the boundaries it crosses, buy Lost and Delirious. That was definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen and it illustrates the the turbulent relationship of two girls at a boarding school."
4,Silence Can Be Golden For A Movie,"An enchanting movie, All Over Me stays true to the heart. A few days in the life of these characters doesn't leave you wanting more, but it does make you question your version of reality. If the events leave you wondering why the characters were sometimes reluctant to speak their minds and hearts, ask yourself if you have really seen the film. When we look for explaination in a movie, we are not looking for reality. Only in the facial expressions and emotions emitting from the characters will we find the solidification in this movie. It does teens great justice, because it leaves a bit of mystery as to what they feel and think. If you really get into this movie, as I did, you come out of watching it as satisfied with its entirety as you would having spent time inside their minds."
4,...get out of Hell's Kitchen,"I saw this on TV a couple of summers back and I can barely remember anything about it, but I do remember that I thought it was pretty darned good. There are legions of shoddy (mostly American) coming-of-age dramas out there, but dedication, attention to detail and lots of pleasing little things like that make this one of the best. TVM material transformed into some kind of masterpiece. I must see it again."
3,Pretty Good!,"I don't know quite where to start on this movie.It's about Claude,a slightly insecure teen. Claude's best friend Ellen has this rapid self-destruction thing going on; and it looks as though she is taking Claude with her. Ellen's boyfiend Mark, is an overly aggressive jerk who seems to be the root of most problems. When one of Claude's new friends is murdered it sets the whole movie in motion.I didn't like the movie that much because it was kind of depressing, but for some reason I liked it anyway. It was a true to life tale and it was all worth it in the end when Claude finds the strength to stand up to Ellen and get on with her life.What I really love about this film is the relationship between Lucy and Claude.Definatly a gotta see."
4,Wig looks great,"This will be a Christmas gift for my four year old granddaughter. When I found this on Amazon, I immediately thought of her. She is very into play acting. It looks to be very suitable for this activity."
5,Excellent!,"If you're interested in the history of Faerun, this is a excellent book. It goes into great detail and has a lot of extras, like relics and historical weapons. Great art and a good read."
3,Old School,"I WAS DISSAPOINTED! EVEN THOUGH THIS DVD WAS RELEASED IN 2005, THE CONTENT IS OVER 20 YEARS OLD! THE SONGS ARE GREAT BUT THIS IS AN OLD CONCERT. I THOUGHT I WAS WATCHING WOODSTOCK ALMOST. PETER DIDN'T DO ANY ANTICS ABOUT OTHER ARTIST LIKE HE DOES NOW LIKE JOHNNY CASH AND MICK JAGGER.I WISH I HAD KNOWN MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE DVD.AMAZON DID A GREAT JOB OF DELIVERING AS PROMISED BUT I WISH THEY HAD SAID THE CONTENT WAS FROM 1986 OR 1987."
5,Sets the mood and stirs so many emotions,"First heard this through our own incredible Jazz radio station WMOT; JulieKelly sings with such earnest emotion and makes it all swing as well. What a marvelous talent backed on most tunes by the Mike Wofford Trio. Ifyou are new to Julie Kelly, I recommend this as a start. It was for me andthese songs came along at a point in my life when I needed them forcomfort. Her voice conjures up smokey speakeasys and intimate clubs from atime when Chet Baker and Art Pepper were blowing cool. Julie's voice is awarm gift to the soul."
3,great music,What can you say. It's classic 90's bass for chilling. This is classic stuff. If you don't know....buy it and you'll love it.
3,"great show, bad ending","If you are planning on purchuseig it and you already saw the whole show and love it then i have no objections. but if you have never seen this show know that the ending is horriable and may want you to put the show away and never watch it again, yes the ending was that bad. It seemed like the animators got kinda lazy toward the end and left just about every string hanging. The begining episodes are really good and you could probably watch them again and again. Before you buy this ask yourself, am i ok with buying the show with one of the most disaponting ending ever?"
4,Good Story But With A Not-So-Good Ending.,The only reason this got 4 stars was due to the ending. It left me sort of let down. I found not knowing what happened to the two heroines really hurt the story. I was left wishing that we knew what came next. The plot does lead up to a nice climax but when we get hung out at the end. Other than that this was a really good series.
4,A bit of everything and done pretty well.,"This is a sci-fi action with magic thrown in. It has a bit of romance, some teen-angst soul-searching and plenty of other genres blended in well enough not to hinder the story-line and in most cases help develop it. As it is a S.A.V.E. edition I definitely though it was worth the money. I'd call it average to a little above average. Due mostly to violence, I would not recommend it for children, and some situations may not be acceptable to some parents."
5,Great easy remote control,"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old son who is obsessed with Power Rangers. It's a great toy that's easy to use. It just has two buttons. One to go forward and one to go back. It's a popular toy to play with when kids come over to play. If you're looking for an easy remote control, this is it."
2,One of the worst text books I've used,Not enough step by step problems...they jump from very easy problems as examples in the text to very hard problems to solve at the end of the chapter. FRUSTRATING!! I'm looking for another book so I can make it through this class.
1,I Hate Physics,"This physics book is impossible to understand. From reading the text and going over the examples, one may think that they completely understand the concepts and how to do them on their own. BUT NO! The questions and problems in the book are nearly impossible. I spend hours trying to find out just what the answer is supposed to be and how I could get to the answer. My friend actually looks up the answers in the back first, then plugs in the numbers until she gets the right answer. She doesnt understand any of the concepts. Therefore, this book is not teaching her, but forcing her to try to teach herself. I spend all my time in class and during my lunch and free blocks at school with my teacher, in an attempt for him to teach me every single problem and the process in which to get the answer. As a result, I HATE PHYSICS."
4,Colorful Physics,I am not majoring in Physics but its compulsory for first-years. I studied using this book for a year and found it interesting and enjoyable.This book is also great for laymen in Physics. Just pick this up and forget for sometime novels and TVs
1,Giancoli Physics Too Difficult and No Help!,"I am taking Physics II and using Giancoli's Physics fifth edition. The entire semester we have had dropout rate of about 85% from our class, and the reason is this book. There are no worked out solutions to any of the problems. The problems at the end of the chapters have no ""frame of reference"" back to the text. If you are trying to work something earnestly, there is no help at all. The Student Manual I purchased today gives absolutely no resonance with the text -- it simply restates things. There are no worked out solutions that conform to the questions at the backs of the chapters. We are all INTENSELY frustrated with this book. He could have done a better job. This book is way too difficult. I have seen other Physics curricula and this is the worst. We are all having a hard time with this book. It's sad because we are stuck using it."
2,"Physics Fifth Edition, Giancoli","While this book has use for college level physics students, I believe the author does not achieve the purpose he states for writing the book in the preface, ""This book is written for students...who are taking a one year introductory course in phyics that uses algebra and triginomoetry but not calculus."" I have found that my students, even some who are studying calculus, are having a difficult time understanding the examples in the book and many of the concepts."
2,Glad to see I'm not the only one who...,"...thinks this book is hard to understand. I switched out of AP Physics B the first week haha.The book does not really try to ""teach"" you physics. I feel like it just ""talks"" about physics."
3,could have more problems worked out step by step,At the begining of this book it would be wonderful to have an introduction to the mathamatical procedures many students in college taking this class have had a summer or more away from the math required i am a A- student in advanced college alg & trig and the concepts are hard to grasp. NEEDS a Workbook to go with it.
4,Pretty Good,The book is pretty good. It is maybe more for the typical advance or college level student. It can be improved if it provides a more thorough explanation but still does a good job explaining easy question for physics. It provides a wide variety of problems. Also it has a scale of difficulty of the problem. Overall I am quiet satisfied with the book.
1,How to keep students away from physics,I am taking physics NOW with THIS book. This is the worth science course I have ever taken. Thanks to this book! Studying physics with this book reminds me walking in the dark with my eyes closed. WHERE is the SOLUTION MANUAL??? Chemistry has become my favorite subject just because they had the SOLUTION MANUAL!!!
2,Down with Giancoli,"Will someone please tell the King that he has no clothes on? Will someone please stop stocking Physics departments with books that are simply a flag for how clever we all are. ""Look at this book chaps...""as we flaunt the open text, ""bloody tough to understand, eh?!""Giancoli is accurate and detailed. Giancoli is a fantastic text to dip into (for the most) able student. In my experience of delivering the subject within the English National Curriculum it is hopeless for the 'average' Physics student. Giancoli is black and white in a colourful world. Has anyone that has ordered this book ever seen a Tom Duncan? Have you looked at the Longman series? Streuth!Why do 'we' make it so difficult for people to access our subject?"
2,Texts like this are why many people fear physics.,"I am a student at a university who has been forced to wade through this book, with little prior knowledge of the topic. The explanations for the theories and concepts are not incredible, but suffice. The problems, however, are torture. Simply having a couple of novice examples throughout the chapters, and then being thrown into the problems at the end with no help but for the ODD answers at the back of the text is not helpful, and not conducive to learning. Frustration is not a good method to get people to understand and/or enjoy a topic. I would not recommend this book for the novice, but can see how it can be used as a good reference book for those of more learning in the topic. A solutions manual really does need to exist, as that is how one learns this subject, through trial and error, and the answers in the back are simply not enough."
2,"Less babble, more physics please...","The author starts chapters by giving simple (maybe too simple) introductions. Then he starts jumping from one aspect of the subject discussed to another, feels like a bad novel in a way. Then there's the humour, and lets not forget the colorful drawings, and the pictures, and all the tables. Then, a couple of simple examples that, in no way, go in depth or cover the scope of the subject discussed. Then, BOOM! Five or six pages of problems that you're supposed to somehow solve with the little understanding you are left with after going through the nursery rhymes and eye candy.WARNING: Unless you have a great instructor, you will suffer, and I mean suffer trying to pass a physics course using this text."
2,Community College Teacher's Remarks on This Book,"I used this book for an introductory physics course for two semesters. Students were very dissatisfied with the book. They claimed, explanations were not clear, there were no two similar problems at the end of the chapters, to practice solving problems with similar concepts.I found some of the problems too difficult for this level course. Many texts have summary of the formulas at the end of the chapters, this one does not.This year we changed the text book for the incoming freshmen,however kept it for physics II to save money for the students who already had Giancoli.For the first time in my 21 years of teaching career, once the students saw the new book we adopted for the course, they wanted ...to buy the Wilson and Buffa's College Physics. When they did this, I realized the intensity of their frustrations."
1,LOW,I did ordered the book from Amazon.com and the seller of the book was thrift book store. But the book I received was wrong and the seller doesn't want full refund of my money that I paid for and doesn't want to exchange or swap with the correct book without paying any money. So rating would be low.
5,"Gloria, the Christmas Angel","Outstanding book! The story of a ""not so perfect"" angel and how she ends up announcing the birth of Christ is concise, elegant and delightful! The illustrations are perfect and fit the story. I collect children's books and was thrilled to find this gem!"
3,Shaky--not for heavy lifting,The bench was a bit unstable--you wouldn't want to use a lot of weight or do serious bench presses on this. I had to return the one I got because it wasn't saudered correctly and wasn't aligned correctly once we finally put it together.
3,Weider Bench,"Must say a bit disappointed - the picture of this bench had black seat and back cushion pads - the actual color is gray, not matching the rest of our home gym equipment. Shame on me for being too lazy to send it back, but consumer - be advised of this discepancy...."
4,Brings back memories,"FOUR AND A HALF STARS.I once had this album with fewer songs on an LP record and wore out the ""Night and Day"" track. I prefer the earlier music of the late Twenties/early Thirties, but all is presented well. Great listening."
5,Good condition actually meant BRAND NEW,"I was more then happy with this book purchase. I desperately needed the book for my Psych Stats class. Classmates were paying a FORTUNE even for used versions of the book at the bookstore. I bought it for LESS then 50% of the used price, and it was listed as good condition. I got the book VERY quickly, and then when I opened up the box, it was literally BRAND NEW. The binding hadn't even been cracked. No marks, or even finger prints were on its shiny cover. I was so happy and I saved necessary money. I have order from Amazon.com before, but this was one the best purchases ever. Pleasantly surprised."
4,The Joy of Statistics?,"Although it is a rare segment of the human population who could claim to find scientific statistics ""enjoyable"", Robert McCall has somehow managed to take some of the pain out of what is generally deemed a horrifying experience. I thank Mr. McCall and the hands-on approach of his book for enabling me to make it through Stats this time with a passing grade!"
3,big freaking deal,"okay jigga and foxy was the bonnie and clyde in 96-97 til he dumped her for amil depends on who you talk to but before this the original bonnie and clyde to me was Ice cube, and yoyo a shame she played out."
5,A snapshot of how ashtanga vinyasa yoga was,"Originally published in Kannada in 1962 and translated and published in English in 1999, Yoga Mala has become a must-read for all students of Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga as taught by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois. It presents the central concepts of vinyasa where the breathing and movement are synchronized to each particular movement. It also presents the Primary Series as it was originally taught by Guruji and thus documents how the practice has evolved as more and more Westerners were exposed to the method. If you are interested in this book, then you should also read Guruji: A Portrait of Sri K Pattabhi Jois through the Eyes of his Students and Matthew Sweeney's Ashtanga Yoga As It Is."
1,Crazy advice,"Lots of 5 star reviews, no doubt from youngsters active in the Astanga cult who believe Jois was some kind of infallible saint. But, this is the last yoga book anyone should take seriously. It's full of mumbojumbo, and worse, contains harmful advice such as holding a headstand for hours (this can cause severe eye damage; I know this because a retinal surgeon told me so, as she had a patient who almost went blind from practicing long headstands).[...]A better option would be to invest in David Swenson or Richard Freeman's media."
4,Good Ashtanga Book,"I have a personal library of about 50 yoga books. This one is not one of my top ten, but it is a soild book. It's like the ""Light on Yoga"" of the Ashtanga world.I wouldn't recommend this book unless you wanted a book specifically about Ashtanga, otherwise their are so many other better books on yoga. If you want a book about Ashtanga, then this and David Swenson's books are the best on that style of yoga."
5,Viva Kennedy,I purchased this book for a Latino Politics class I am taking. It was a great read. The era was significant to Latinos in politics in the US and the Viva Kennedy clubs created the pathway for many Latinos in office today. The book was in great shape for the price. Thanks!
5,Great picnic basket,"Bought this picnic basket as a gift for my granddaughter. Here in the Northwest we have many great outdoor summer concert venues where picnicking is encouraged, and this is a great must-have, all-in-one basket to enable my granddaughter and her fiance to enjoy these events. I would say when filled with food it could be a bit heavy for anyone who has trouble with weighty items, but probably that would be the case carrying any picnic basket. This is a quality product and not flimsy."
1,Do not buy it,"It is not even a Nintendo Licenced title. Most important, it does not work on my gameboy advance sp. I baught a junk."
5,great story,"My three year old LOVES, LOVES, LOVES this story. The illustrations are great & the plot is unique and captivating for young readers."
2,Couldn't use the product,"While searching for something similar to the original type of thermal interface material for an old Dell laptop heatsink, I found this thermal tape. The product may be useful for other types of applications, but it did not work well at all for what I needed it for. I believe it is just too thin, and did not make good contact between the chip and the heatsink."
1,Very Thin Useless Thermal Tape,"I do not recommend this product for my intended purpose. I ordered this tape to replace tape on my video card. Unfortunately, this tape is not even thick enough to make contact between the two surfaces rendering it completely useless. Even when doubled (using 2 pads) the resulted thickness pales to provide adequate contact and heat protection. Therefore, I advise to seek other means for heat protection."
3,Pretty Good Yule Log Music,"while the Percy Faith Christmas albums are the all time best,this collection is just a notch below.if you like your Christmas music more Orchestral/Classical in nature, you will love it."
5,Simply the best Christmas album of all time.,"This Christmas album (circa 1950s) is probably the last by a major symphony orchestra that hasn't been watered down with token secular carols. The jacket says it's a ""very unusual"" arrangement, and it is: it's the only Christmas album that you'll want to crank the volume way UP. There isn't another Christmas album that comes close to ""The Music of Christmas"" by the Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra."
5,The Best of the Best,"The most beautiful, emotion wrought, stirring arrangements of Christmas music ever recorded. I have been listening to this album since the 60's; it epitomizes Christmas. No other recording I have ever heard even comes close. An absolute must own!!"
5,"""Say it IS so Joe."" A perfect collection of S&G","Culling the biggest hits from Simon and Garfunkle's extraordinary late 1960's career, ""Greatest Hits"" is a perfect dose of their music. All of their most beloved songs are here, kicking off with the anthemic ""Mrs. Robinson"" and its Joe DiMagio reference and continuing with classics like ""The Boxer,"" ""America,"" ""Sounds of Silence,"" ""Homeward Bound"" and ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" before concluding with the excellent rocking ""Cecillia."" Many of these songs are among the most well known 60s tunes this side of either The Beatles or The Rolling Stones. Paul Simon's songwriting has always been one of this county's great artistic treasures, and his tunes never sounded better than when they were accompanied by Art Garfunkle's gorgeous tenor. A must have for popular music fans."
1,Great Songs Ruined By A Poor Outdated Compilation,"This greatest hits CD is ruined by the presence of a number of live cuts. The applause from those songs fades out while the next song fades in. This ruins Sound Of Silence and Bridge Over Troubled Water. Of course, the live version of Homeward Bound is used and it is not nearly as good as the studio version. If you want a good single disc compilation, you may need to look at the import section, many of which fit about twenty tracks on a single CD. Also, the Old Friends box set has far superior sound. This is a compilation that was made for the LP age in terms of tracking time. It served its purpose thirty years ago but Columbia needs to issue a disc with the original songs, about 30-40% more songs, and an improved booklet with some background information on this historic duo. This CD, as it stands now, is a woefully inadequate package given the importance of Simon and Garfunkel."
3,A good selection of Simon & Garfunkel 60's classics!,"In my opinion it's a good collection but expect I don't prefer the live concert version of ""Homeward Bound"" included on here. Because I think the studio recording is way better than ever comparing. But the rest of all the songs on it from their greatest hits CD is just great!"
2,uses live recordings - - which means - - guess,"If you like listening to loud applause on your recordings - - you'll like this cd. I was very disappointed - - a more than average priced (expensive) CD and you get to listen to applause - - horrible. Would not have bought it, myself had I known - - If that doesn't bother you - - the CD's fine. Wish I had known."
2,What have they done ....Not the original versions,They just about ruined Homeward Bound..I don't ever listen to it...why do they do this? ...we want the original versions ...I am sure they are available..
1,Not For The CD Age,Compact discs can hold almost eight minutes on a single disc. This doesn't. Live versions of songs. Applause which runs into studio songs. This is just no good.
4,there are live songs on this cd,"this is a well put together cd, with the exception of the surprise live tracks. and even then, the audience sounds extremely canned, almost making me cringe.but, the songs are so good, that i am willing to ignore the fact that this has some live tracks on it."
5,S&G at their best,"I didn't grow up with these two incredible musicians, so I'm not sure what their motivation was behind their music, but I love it. The first time I ever really experienced the power of Paul Simon's voice was when watching a rerun of Saturday Night Live when he performed with Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and I got hooked. I bought the CD mainly for Mrs. Robinson, but I knew of some of the other songs, and fell in love with the rest. This album covers a wide range of emotions from the upbeat ""Cecilia"" to the mellow ""Scarborough Fair/ Canticle"", and from the motivational ""I Am a Rock"" to the feel-good ""Mrs. Robinson."" I cannot say enough good things about this album. S&G harmonize beautifully, and the sound quality is incredible. My only complaint is that ""Kodachrome"" isn't on this album, but other than that, this CD is perfect."
5,As advertised.,This is a classic album by the boys. I bought the CD to replace a vinyl LP that was literally worn out. It would be a good choice for some one who does not have any of their other albums in their library.
1,Avoid this re-tread,"While the artistic quality of Simon and Garfunkel's music on this CD is not in dispute, this must rank as one of the worst re-releases on record.Not only is it a re-issue of the first CD Greatest Hits collection, from the medium's mid-1980s infancy, but it's a re-issue of the original vinyl LP, from 1972. Everything identical - sleeve, tracklisting, order, running time of 44 mins 30 secs.There are much better retrospectives of their work around, more comprehensive and better value despite the higher outlay. I cannot imagine why they have decided to re-issue this now, or who they're aiming it at, other than conoisseurs of blue jeans, flat caps and moustaches, perhaps."
2,Flawed Track Listing,"I was disappointed to find that both ""The Sounds of Silence"" and ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" are live performances, despite the fact that Amazon doesn't disclose this in the track listing. I really only wanted those two songs. Now, I will go to iTunes and download them, just like I should have done in the first place."
3,Good yet worthless,"I myself love Simon and Garfunkel, but I was very dissopointed to learn that for the majority of the album, the songs are live recordings. Who wants the beautiful song, Bridge Over Troubled Water ruined with applause? And as the other review stated, half the songs are not the well-known versions!!!! Geez."
2,This is a live performance and ....,"They completely screwed up ""Homeward Bound"". They don't tell you it's live. As you know the music in live recordings are almost always altered in some way."
3,"Almost Enough Simon, Enough Garfunkel","These songs are so typical of Paul Simon that you could never own another of his records, solo or otherwise, and not miss anything.Art's falsetto is wonderful, but after 10 songs I'm ready to scream.I loved this album as an early teen, and I would recommend it highly to anyone born after 1985. The rest of us need a little more meat with our sweet, lest we get a tummy ache.God is filling. No heartburn.Out."
1,Listen To Your Favorite Songs......Ruined,"Too many live cuts segueing into studio cuts thereby ruining the latter. Before audience aplause fades out, another song begins (ruins ""Sound of Silence"" and ""Bridge Over Troubled Water""). The duo is better served by higher quality imports or the boxed sets than by this collection. Someday, Sony Music should release a collection of these songs and utilize the original studio versions to replace this."
2,"Splurge on the ""Old Friends"" box set instead.","I must agree with those who express disappointment in this collection. It is not so much that some of these songs are live version, as in some cases (""For Emily,"" and ""59th Street"" are good examples) they are better than the original studio versions.The problem is that sometimes these live versions interfere with some of the studio versions. For example, both the beginning of ""Sounds of Silence"" and ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" even though they are the original studio versions, contain the audience applause spilling over from the previous live track. There was absolutely NO reason to do this and the result distracts from the songs. This is especially true in the case of ""Bridge"" which remains one of most moving songs of all time.So I would suggest that you save your $15.00 and use it as a down payment on the ""Old Friends"" box set. There you get all the hits, without the intrusions."
5,All my favorites in one album,"The title says it. All my favorite Simon & Garfunkel songs are all in this one album. Even if you're not that big of a Simon & Garfunkel fan, you will definitely enjoy this album since it's packed with the best songs. I would recommend it to anybody who likes them as well."
2,This Album is a LIE!!!,"This is NOT a greatest hits album! Some of the hits have been replaced with live versions which were not the hits. The hits are the songs people remember from the radio. People bought this thinking they were getting the versions they knew. There is ZERO indication on the sleeve that this has any live versions. Not only that, but they crossfade some of the applause into the beginning of the studio versions. How irritating!!Is this a scam to make people buy the full albums or singles that they really want? Probably. Did the producers actually think the live versions are better? They are not, neither artistically or sonically. If they want a live Simon and Garfunkle album, make it and sell it to the serious die-hards who care."
2,Careful - Tracks 4 & 8 are Live and Track 8 bleeds into Track 9!,"If you want the songs you remember, avoid this CD in favor of the ""Definitive Simon & Garfunkel"" Sony TVK 24003 available athttp://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Simon-Garfunkel/dp/B0000566K2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=music&qid;=1221346327&sr;=1-1These Tracks are problematic:4. 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy) - Live version8. Homeward Bound - Live version9. Bridge Over Troubled Water - Original ruined by applause bleed-in from end of previous track!In addition, this CD is missing these songs that are worthwhile:Seven O'Clock News/Silent NightA Hazy Shade Of WinterThere are a couple of other songs on the Definitive that are just okay.Neither album contains ""Keeping the Customer Satisfied,"" one of my personal favorites.I recommend ""The Definitive"" album over this one if you want a complilation on one CD.AlphaKid42"
1,Outdated and Troublesome Collection,"Since S&G now have a ""complete works"" collection on CD, why bother with this, an oddly mixed album that contains live and edited versions of some of their big hits? Not recommended."
1,Superb Music-Lousy Compilation,"The songs on this album truly represent the best of Simon and Garfunkel. Unfortunately, someone decided it would be a good idea to insert ""live"" versions of some of the songs. Most of these live versions are inferior to the original studio recordings, not to mention that it does not mention anywhere on the album jakcet which cuts are live, or even that ANY of them are live. This alone makes this one of the worst Greatest hits albums ever eleased, which is tragic, considering the enormous talent of S&G. You'd think that with such an influential force in 60's pop music, Columbia would have had no trouble coming up with a QUALITY greatest hits package. It isn't like they had any shortage of good material..."
3,Only the applause is distracting (and out-of-tune Paul),"As stated above, I too was very distracted by the applause from the live tracks spilling into the intros of the classic studio versions. It would seem that the only people that wouldn't be bothered by this listen to all their music on the radio. I like to hear a composition from the beginning to the end. Also, Paul's out of tune voice (characteristic of his live singing) on Homeward Bound really ruins this version. I was wishing I was listening to the original. Of course the bottom line is this is Simon & Garfunkel, and these songs are great and classic despite the intrusive nature of the arranger(s) of the CD."
3,Lao's review,"A ""half-way"" manual for those who want a step up from the Chinese Food Cures book. Black and white botanical plates, with focus on traditional Chinese use of medicinal herbs. The book is organized by complaint, with medicinals listed by Chinese names in no discernable order. This makes it harder for Americans to use, but gives a better understanding of the Chinese theory of healing."
2,Not a complete collection of writings,"This book completely leaves out their political writings. If you want to learn about their artistic beliefs it's a good book, but it has none of their (important) political writings."
5,"Oh, Hazel","...I love her! It's always a risk for a show to add a new character after so long, but in this case it worked...her particular brand of crazy is somewhat similar to Jenna's, but still worthwhile and good for many laughs. And it's not just her that I love; the show is fresher and funnier than it's been in at least a couple years. Maybe not quite perfectly consistent, but its best episodes kept me laughing hysterically from beginning to end. All this, AND I get to look at cutie James Marsden? GOOD TIMES. I'm happy that 30 Rock is entering its final year, because if the show can maintain this level of writing and acting for one more season, it will be one of the few comedies to end its run before going totally stale. And I am hopeful that this will be the case, because some of the episodes in season six were every bit as good as those in the show's first couple seasons. Very funny stuff...now if Tina Fey would just write another hilarious book..."
5,"Another amazing, witty season!","It never fails. I'll find a new show that I just love and it'll go flat in 2 seasons. That is not the case with 30 Rock! It has been consistently top notch every season. Season 6 is no different as it keeps you laughing. Every time I hear a Mickey Rouke joke from Jenna, I laugh out loud just thinking of all he's done to her over the years! Clever writing and wacky humor make this one of the best comedies on TV now, in my opinion. I will be sad to see it end but I do feel like its a show I can go back to every couple months."
5,Do you like to laugh?,"If you DO like to laugh, I am guessing you will like this show if you don't already. Check it out."
4,I like what I see,"well well well... the preview shows a lot of ENERGY and creative dialog with green screen location footage along with guest stars who must need the money... but i watch the show drunk so ""take it from there"" oh, the Chinese delivery is knocking, gotta go"
2,"Great Show, Disappointing Season","I'm a huge fan of 30 Rock. It's probably one of my favorite shows on, or at least it was. I see this season got great reviews on here which makes me wonder if I'm the only one who was underwhelmed by Season Six. I really never found myself laughing out loud like in past seasons."
5,"30 rock, season six","This series lived up to expectations. A firm favourite in this household. we were pleased to have it in time to give as a Xmas gift, which was thoroughly enjoyed."
5,Nice collection!,"These songs are the long versions rather than radio edits so I'm glad I found her biggest hit ""Boogie Oogie Boogie Woogie Dancing Shoes"" in that form! If you like disco, get this album!"
3,Disco Veteran!,"There are certainly some great dancefloor memories here, but apart from better tracks like ""Work Me Over"" and the epic ""Down and Counting"", things tend to get a tad ""cheesy"" which may be a little hard for non disco fans to swallow. But otherwise if you are a fan of the artist or the style, it's not a bad collection."
2,On the low side of mediocre,"After Frostburn, which is a very similar book which I liked, I expected this one to be good too. I was wrong. Let's face it, we buy the supplimental DnD books for feats, prestige classes, spells and a few quirky magic bits. Most of the rest of these books are pretty poor. Once in a while the author takes the theme to another level, which I think they did with Frostburn to some extent, and Libris Mortis too. Sandstorm is almost a waste of time. The races, prestige classes and quirky magics are horrible and almost useless in any campaign. A good part of the feats are the same. And there isn't much mentioned on desert themed campaigns to complain about. ""sigh"". I'd recommend buying something like Heroes of Battle instead."
5,Say it In Six,"I love this book. I am a college speech instructor, and this book is a great adjunct to my college speech text. The students have to give a number of speeches that must be short, and Say it in Six gives excellent justification for the short and to the point speech. This book speaks to the real world of public speaking. There is a great idea about the short speech to save your job. This is very practical in the world of down sizing. I have this book on my recommended list of speech books to purchase, and from time to time I quote from it. I tell my students to seek out the experts when they give a talk even if they think they know much about their topic. I may know much about speech, but Ron Hoff is my expert.Jessica Kelpine"
5,Say It In Six,"For any of you who have attended meetings you're aware of how they can drone on and on and never get to the point. This little book is invaluable for those who are the speaker at those meetings. After reading it, you'll find that the tools are valuable in every day life as well. Whatever you have to say, you can say it in just six minutes or less and not only get your point across but stimulate your audience to action. Great little book...paperback... only 6"" x 9"" and 154 pages. There are even worksheets complete with the key words to help you ""Say It In Six or less"". Great buy!"
3,Only two good songs,"This album only has two songs which I really, really, really like. ""Cuando Todo Va Mal"" (which is the one that made buy the album in the first place), and ""Que Feliz se Te Ve"", which later on became my favorite.The rest of the album is strange-sounding, and may even be amusing to some people, but this type of music (electronic/dance/chill out/retro) is not my normal cup-of-tea.I would recommend reviewing first the albumt in iTunes (or similar webpage), and then download whatever songs you may like. If you like it all, then perfect, buy the whole thing, or the CD!"
2,DVD buyer beware,"Viewers hoping to see the controversial ""pistol"" scene, in which McGillis's character is forced by her jealous husband to open her legs for his gun will be disappointed to find that it has been cut from the R-rated DVD version. For that, you'll apparently have to stick with the unrated VHS tape. Other than that, the movie is a decent if unspectacular B thriller, and the digital transfer is pretty good."
2,a good movie lessened by censorship,"This DVD is 7 min. shorter than the previously released VHS version. Most of the steamier scenes have been cutcompletely or edited for content.While these scenes are not crucial to the plot,they were part of the original presentation and should have remained as they aided in character developement.A good movie lessened by censorship."
3,"Nothing, done well","A thin story of intrigue and desire in Miami is made very watchable by a good director and a superb collection of actors. Weller and McGillis are thoughtful and convincing as reluctant lovers trying simply to be left in peace. Frederick Forrest provides strong support. Charles Durning, in a small role, walks away with the movie. The character he plays is smart, cunning and, by turns, endearing and brutal. Durning is the reason I've watched this film three or four times since it first appeared in 1990, and I recommend you give it a try."
2,Tried too hard to be cool,"I rediscovered this movie recently, but wish I hadn't. I much prefer historical dramas that stick to the era in which they actually took place. This version attempts to be cool, hip, and modern with strange sets, modern costumes, mixed in with what can only be termed pseudo-Shakespearan language. I love Tilda Swinton, but this is not one of her better films."
1,One Of The Worst Movies Ever Shot,"Total and utter waste of time, film, talent, plot, with a terrible experimental post-mod setting for Marlow's Elizabethan story of the eponymous fourteenth-century king. I already look down on most productions that set an historical story outside its time frame but this anachronism was a special example of awfulness, from its drabness to the misuse of the slightly androgynous Tilda Swinton as a glamorous scorned queen. Everything about this production stank, from its bastardizing of Marlow's lines, to its casting, to its setting and sets, everything. I truly despised this motion picture and hope Edward II gets re-made in a more faithful version than this one."
2,It has a few redeeming qualities,"I liked the peformance by the actress playing Isabella. Loved her clothes and makeup. The use of modern clothes and spartan sets in a production that has an painfully low budget doesn't present a problem.Beyond that, well, I know the director is trying to make a point about the brutal suppression of gays and possibly the government policies under Mrs. Thatcher. It's unfortunate that the sexual scenes and extremely graphic violence are purely gratuitous.The actors playing Edward II and Gaveston are too pretty and resemble one another to a weird degree (intentional?)"
3,"If your using Seachem Prime in your tank, it will show a false positive.","For people using Prime in their tanks: Prime acts as a binder for ammonia to make it safe. There are two types of ammonia in fish tanks. NH3 and NH4. One is free ammonia, and the other is ionized ammonia. Free ammonia is very dangerous to fish, the other is not as dangerous. The API Ammonia Test Kit only checks for the presence of ammonia, it can't tell you which it's detecting giving you a positive result when the only ammonia may be ionized ammonia. I'm sure that kit works well, but for those of us using prime, you want to use the Seachem MultiTest: Free & Total Ammonia test kit.Seachem MultiTest Ammonia Test Kit"
4,"Fits perfect, but could use some inner padding.","Fit the tripod perfect and easy to use. Also, seems to be a good material. The only drawback is there needs to be some padding inside. All in all, pretty decent case."
2,Fed Ex truck,"I bought this truck for my 3 year old nephew. Within 24 hours the side mirrors were broken, and within a few days the pin that links the cab and trailor together broke off. This is not a durable toy."
3,Well made but not for constant use and storage,"Although it is a well made product and it seems to be more than adequate for its purpose, this cable is too rigid to be rolled back into a loop and stored; the cable is flat, which is what I wanted for when I need to bring the cord thru a cracked door, but the stiffness does not allow for an easy storage. It took me about 10 minutes on the parking area to finally roll it back before returning it."
2,tee splitting,feels durable has some weight to it but tee top started to split after one practice!!! not acceptable at all for a coach and 60 dollars later . will never purchase this brand again or recommend to anyone .
3,Watch It,"I think this movie shows just how long a person can go before they just snap and hurt someone. This girl was abused so much and became so afraid to tell anyonne about it. It you ever have someone in your life that you think may be getting abused by thier spouse, do somethin, ANYTHING to help them get out of that situation. It could save their life"
3,Not as good as it sounds...,I didn't really care for this movie. Although the story was a powerful one the mediocre acting didn't do it any justice. I had to watch it 3 times because I kept falling asleep.I even found myself dozing at the parts that were supposed to be action filled.
2,tell be for its to late!,"I HAD COMPASSION FOR HER BUT HER FATHER WAS THE CHIEF OF POLICE SHE WOULD,VE HAD HELP BUT WHEN UR ABBUSED UR NEVER IN THE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND MOST WOMAN WHO GO THROUGH THIS FEEL EMBARRESSED OR ASHAMED TO TELL BECAUSE THEY DONT WANT TO BE JUDGED BY ANYONE BECAUSE THAT QUESTION IS ALWAYS ASKED WHY DO U STAY BUT THEY NEVER ASK THE MEN WHY DO U BEAT!"
4,"I WON'T EAT, SLEEP OR LIVE WITHOUT THIS!","This such a strong ballad and becomeing a electronica mixed track makes this a great tune to hear over and over again!, great song! great artist."
2,Never got it to work completely right...,"I have a Win98SE OS and the manual says the product is compatible for the cameraphone's model and OS,but the Motorolla toll free number says I have to get the 3.0-3.5 version for my OS and so I recently did so from Amazon..in the beginning the pixs transfer was working but the internet access say an error message stating port not available or something like that..I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it several times as well as downloading the slow live update from a 4.122 to a 4.221 version and it still did'nt work..maybe I'm doing something wrong,but then again I'm not computer savvy..good luck if you can figure it out..I think the 3.0 version would work from Amazon.."
2,FOR THE CLASS ROOM,"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK, BASED ON AUTHORS TREATMENT OF SITTING BULL. TOO BORING ON DETAIL, I WAS HOPING FOR INSIGHT ON THE VARIOUS TRIBES . HIS FACTS COULD BE CORRECT, BUT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT 1500 INDIANS VS ABOUT THE SAME SOLDIERS OR VOLUNTEERS, ALMOST ALWAYS FORTY INDIANS DIE, ONLY TWO OR THREE SOLDIERS OR VOLUNTEERS ARE KILLED. IM SURE THE AUTHOR WORKED HARD ON BOOK, FOR MY TASTE, NO ENTERTAINMENT VALUE.I STRUGLED TO GET THRU, MANY BATTLES I WAS FAMILIAR WITH. ANY ONE INTERESTED IN HISTORY ALL THE INDIAN BATTLES, DATES, ETC. HAVE AT IT."
4,Very solid glimpse into everyday drugs life,"Found this to be a very good little film. While I could have used a bit more depth of character development, I liked that it didn't overreach - it felt as authentic as a 'snapshot' movie about the drugs trade can be without being a documentary. Also appreciated the Desi element... it added an interesting dimension to the story (albeit a dimension that was not explored as thoroughly as I might have liked).In sum, certainly worth watching for its very good acting and sense of dramatic tension."
4,good bread!,"This is a very good mix, I have used ut 2 times, the `1st time I got the water too hot, and bread was too dense. 2nd time, perfect loaf."
2,Not sure if its working.,"I have a sand substrate and I'm not sure if its letting the nutrients get to the roots. Dont get me wrong the plants are growing but it seems like the Excel has more to do with that than the Leaf Zone. Plants dont look very strong, I wouldnt recomend for use with sand beds."
2,I don't like it..,"Tried this product for one month. It add no growth other than black alge and some other form of alge that i have never seen. Not happy w it. You get what you pay for, so im going back to my former plant food-Yamotogreen. BEST PRODUCT EVER. This product, though it may cost $14 dollars, will do what it is intended and more."
4,"Right now, it's recovering plants...",Pros:Recovering Brown PlantsProducing New Leaves on my Jungle ValFish are fineCons:Large amount to put in for a 55 gallon tank.Not the fastest acting plant food.
5,This book is a MUST!,"OK, so you want to jazz up, spruce up, or just plain revive your collectibles or even your non-collectibles? This amazing little title tells you how to do it without purchasing an arsenal of solvents, cleansers, cleaners, thinners, buffers, waxes, paints, charms, spells, potions etc. What tickles here is the amazing revelation that perhaps in your refrigerator you possess the magic ingredients to accomplish miracles you never thought possible for your treasured items. I mean, Ms. Katz-Schwarz might very well be able to write a second volume on how to accomplish fission with a bottle of baby oil, a skate key, and left overs from last Sunday's football bash. Kudos to you, Ms. Katz-Schwarz for helping make instant experts of your readers. Her ability to personalize the edition with lovely and always humorous family anecdotes only adds to the overall ""wonderfulness"" of this most useful and enjoyable book. Kind author, we await another capolavoro!"
5,Saved money and effort,"I used the idea of alumunum foil, baking soda and salt on my silver. Got out stuff that I'd not been able to clean in years.Great idea for large pieces, or doing a set of flatware all at once."
5,Antiquer for an Antique Lover..,This was a most interesting book and with wonderful secrets on antique treasures. I love Judith's writing on the Grandma stories and then of course the wonderful tips on all the inexpensive ways of cleaning and caring for antiques. Thanks for all of your stories and tips creating a great book. J. Carter
5,good stuff !,"i enjoy this gluten free product every day, sometimes twice a day.i eat it with soy milk and fruit."
5,Organic Mesa Sunrise is awesome!,"We love this cereal, both parents, child and toddler! Unlike many other Gluten Free cereals, it contains a bit more fiber; which if you are Celiac you understand why I mention that! The fiber content is not overly high, so I would gather that it has more to do with the flax. It is a good crispy cereal with a fairly mild flavor, which is slightly sweet. The one peculiar thing is that even though it tastes great, the smell is not as pleasant as the taste. This is also likely because of the flax. And if it gets past the expiration date, you will know it... nasty odor! That said, it is probably the best organic, gluten free cereal we have found that has more nutritional value. Unfortunately many GF cereals seem to lack nutritional content. Buying it by the case from Amazon, using Subscribe and Save is hands down the best deal I have found. Hopefully someday Nature's Path will make the Vanilla and Maple flavored Mesa Sunrises in the economy size too."
5,Great Cereal,"This is my favorite gluten free cereal - and healthy too! My semi-local health food store can't keep enough of it in stock so I am thrilled to have it on subscribe and save.Nature's Path Organic Mesa Sunrise Cereal, 26.4-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)"
5,GREAT cereal - just happens to also be gluten free,"As I said in the title, this is great cereal that also just happens to be gluten free. It's not a ""kids"" cereal, and has a distinct taste that is somewhat unlike any other (so it's hard to describe). I purchase it by the case (six) of the large bags (26.4 oz./bag), and eat it often. I don't know what else to say beyond that - great cereal, very good pricing even when compared to much poorer quality ""supermarket"" cereals. Nature's Path makes a number of really quality cereals, and this is one of my favorites. I give 5 stars only with truly superior products - and this one is a no-brainer.I can imagine there will be some who will not like the taste all that much (especially those used to sugared cereals), so perhaps buying one smaller box at the grocery store would make sense to ""sample"" it (if they even carry it - try a health food store or the ""natural"" section of your regular supermarket if they have one)."
1,Used to be great. Now horrible.,"My wife has celiac disease so she's on a gluten-free diet. She used to love this cereal and we had it on a ""Subscribe & Save"" from Amazon. The product changed in the last order and it's now horrible and we cancelled our subscription. The manufacturer needs to go back to the former recipe!"
3,correct the nutrition info,"I purchased the Mesa Sunrise cereal because it is gluten free and supposed to have 6 grams of fiber per serving. It has only 3 grams of fiber. It does taste good, but I notice your description still says the 6 grams. Suggest you change it."
1,Tastes Terrible,This cereal tastes terrible. I had one bowl and I could barely eat half of it. They need to go back to the drawing board
2,Terrible smell,"The last two packages I purchased had a terrible smell and taste. There have been numerous other reports here and on the Nature's Path website of a bad, possibly rancid smell. On their website, Nature's Path has offered ""to make this right"" when someone submits a complaint.Update (January, 2013)Nature's Path apparently has fixed the problem. The old familiar taste is back. This is my favorite gluten free cereal. My advice though is to look at the expiration dates before purchasing. I would only buy dates that are at least 3 months in the future. Flax goes rancid relatively quickly."
5,Mesa Sunrise Gluten Free Cereal,"This is the most nutritious gluten free cereal I have found! I buy it in lots of six ecopacks, and I am never out of it."
1,Reformulated to remove all taste,"Prior to 2012, this was my favorite cereal. Tasty, healthy and gluten-free. Sometime in 2012, they reformulated the flakes such that they are now totally tasteless and lack any texture. They are thin and become almost instant mush in liquid. There is no longer any solid 'crunch' or interest. You might as well be eating cheap corn flakes. Save your money until they return to the old recipe."
3,The cereal has changed,"I used to buy this cereal for my husband, who has celiac. He tells me that it's been reformulated and now the flavor isn't quite as good as it was and it gets soggy in milk quickly. Sadly, I'm switching to something else. For someone who must be gluten free, this is still a good option, but I'm not sure that the change in the product makes it worth the price anymore.Nature's Path Organic Mesa Sunrise Cereal, 26.4-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)"
3,"Mmmm...squashy. Gluten-free, though.","O.k., disclaimer: in addition to being gluten intolerant, I'm actually something of a food snob.What's great about this:Good texture--it's like raisin bran, which is fantastic if you have adult-onset celiac and still crave raisin branHolds up well in milk. It didn't get soggy fast.It's really gluten-free! No stomachache, etc.What's not so great:This tastes, I swear, like squash. Even doused in really sweet almond milk and raisins, I couldn't choke down more than a few spoonfuls. The taste, if you are a medium-to-supertaster, is beyond disgusting.This would probably be good for not-so-picky-gluten-free-eaters, but it's a bad idea for picky kids, so don't spend the extra to buy it in bulk, until your picky eaters have tasted it, first.More gluten-free food for my local food bank. Score."
4,Quick and Easy for Celiacs,I purchased this cereal because of my intolerance to gluten. It does not upset my stomach so that is nice. It tastes fine I like to sprinkle it with a little xylitol and use almond milk instead of cow. It is not fantastic nor is it gross. I am pleased with it.
1,Not Nice,"Unfortunately, all six packages that arrived were within one week of their expiration date, and all six packages of cereal were rancid. To its credit, Amazon refunded the total price for the product. We were very disappointed because we have been great fans of the Mesa Sunrise Cereal, which we have previously purchased from the local grocery stores. Perhaps Amazon could somehow list the expiration dates of the product(s) before listing them on its website."
5,Wholesome and a great deal,"The number of palatable gluten free cereal flakes is quite limited and they are usually quite expensive. This cereal costs $7.00/bag at my local health food store. One needs a place to store a case of 26 oz bags, but it's worth it to buy from Amazon.com by the case."
4,Delicious!,"This is one of my favorite Gluten Free cereals, and ranks near the top of my list from before going on a Gluten free diet. Highly recommend! Took one star off because it gets soggy pretty quickly, but I found a work around to that....eat faster!"
4,R&B Holiday Hits,"I can't believe no one has reviewed this collection as yet! I bought this on cassette when it first came out about 8 yrs. ago & my tape is finally wearing out. Plenty of gems on here by many of the best r&b/soul artists around. Jingle Bells by Booker T. & the MG's, White Christmas by Otis Redding, Christmas Forever by Freddie Jackson & Let's Make Christmas Merry, Baby by Amos Milburn are all major standouts. What are you waiting for-this is a must-have for anyone into Yuletide R&B. Highly recommended."
5,Senior Fitness Test Manual,"I am a health consultant to senior citizens. This book provides easy and effective tests to measure their aerobic fitness, strength and flexibility without sophisticated equiptment. I am grateful to the authors for their research and testing prior to publishing this tool for alerting seniors to their level of fitness."
5,cookie dough without the guilt or the tummy ache,I fell in love with these cookie dough protien bars (METRX)in the 90's thank GOD they still make them. It's got the mouth feel of real cookie dough- heck it's even better than real cookie dough because it's so delightfully thick and a little chewy. After eating one of these you don't feel like your having a cookie hang over. You feel like you could climb a mountain. I bring them to work when I need to power through a very physical 12 hour shift. I eat them when I'm in major pig out mode and am having insane sugar cravings. They provide all the satisfaction without the guilt and actually curb your appetite instead of feuling it. Wonderful product. I have one box of 12 delivered each month. It's like Christmas when they arrive.
4,"Great taste, great texture, great value.","These puppies are a little on the sweet side for protein bars, but the ingredients are solid and the taste is fantastic. At an average, these things are a perfect stand in for a missed breakfast or dinner, a very filling snack, or as a stand-alone lunch.I should emphasize that: these are pretty big bars. They are bigger and more packed (and better) than a standard sized powerbar. I've been using these as my lunch for two weeks and don't get hungry again for 4-6 hours after eating them, but that's pretty subjective - if I was hiking, that would be a different story. I will definitely bring these on the NEXT hike, that you can be sure of!Two weeks as a lunch and I'm not sick of the flavor - there's no awful aftertaste, they don't dry you out like Cliff bars sometimes do, and the little bits of chocolate are a pleasant addition."
2,Terrible taste,"Worst tasting protein bar i've ever had, its torture eating this thing. It has a good amount of protein, but that's about all it has going for it."
4,"Filling bar, but too sweet","I purchased a Met-Rx Big100 Meal Replacement bar, chocolate chip cookie dough at a local store. The 26g of protein is sufficient. However, the bar is too sweet tasting. There is 25g of sugar. The protein bar is chewy. The 370 calories is much lesser than junk food at fast food restaurants. I recommend this protein bar."
4,Quite Good,"This protein bar is quite good actually, i wouldnt say delicious but it doesnt taste bad. It has a lot of protein and lots of vitamins and are very good to replace a snack in tough moments. I havent tried many protein bars but this is the best so far i've seen!"
1,Incorrect description - BEWARE NUT ALLERGIES,"The description online says it doesn't contain nuts - but the packaging does! It's hard to find bars without nuts, so I'm disappointed and returning."
4,Great price but texture is a little bland,"I eat Met-RX meal bars every day. I've tried every single meal bar flavor multiple times, and there seems to be 3 variants. The crunchy variety, the ""brownie"" variety, and the mushy variety. The cookie flavor is the mushy variety, and while it's fine to eat, it's a bit like eating taffy. I prefer the crunchy variety the most, with my favorite being the ""Sweet and Salty"" and the crunchy pretzel one. Unfortunately the cookie dough flavor is the cheapest, but sometimes stores like Kroger will have sales and that's definitely the time to try the other flavors. It's really filling, decent flavor, but I definitely prefer the crunchy varieties much more."
1,Nasty!,"The consistency of these bars is like chewy clay and the taste, while tolerable at first, is highly synthetic and off-putting. I have 9 more bars left and I can't force myself to eat them. These taste and feel extremely artificial and hardly pass as food. Try Tri-o-Plex bars for a more natural, pallatable and good-tasting protein bar."
2,Big 100 Food Bar Choc. Chip Cookie 12 bars,"Not a very good tasting bar, among the worst I have ever tried.Seller was awesome, shipping was great, the product not so much."
2,Mushy Met-Rx,Price is not a bargain. Many times the bars are almost melded into the wrapper and are hard to get to.
3,good stuff,"I liked it, but I think it worth noting that for most of the CD the guitar is much more prominent than the organ."
4,"average player, excellent mount","The player doesn't strike me as any different from other low-cost players, but the headrest mount is brilliant. The connector to the cigarette lighter DC supply fell apart, though I am not positive whether it did that on it's own or whether little fingers took it apart."
2,Hard to get satisfactory customer help,So far the DVD player is working fine and the attachment to seat is great.Have only used it on two long car trips. Wanted to get a battery for it so she could watch it out of the car but am really having a difficult time doing so. They say it's available but have had no luck getting them to tell me how to get one. Customer service for this item has been less than satisfactory and I would never buy another nextar product.
1,Buyer Beware,"We are currently on our second unit and both have stopped working for no apparent reason. The seat mount is well designed, however, the DVD player is clearly garbage and the unit should not be purchased. Reading other reviews, it is apparent that there is an inherent problem with these devices."
3,You get what you pay for,"When I first saw this item, I thought it was the perfect dvd player for the car.It worked perfectly for over a year,no problems at all. Then all of a sudden it started to lock-up or freeze the screen. My son would give it a little tap to get it going again. Now it will not work when it is cold outside. I still use it when I travel, the accessories let me use it through the hotel tv. I purchased another one and have not had any problems so far after about six months.I still think for the price it is a great deal."
1,look for something better.,"Bought 2 of those units they pretty much suck.... one quit working after 2 month the screen went black,, and the other works when it feels like it.. the one that works WHEN IT!!! works is pretty good. my guess is look for something better quality even if u have to pay a $bit more."
4,Carol Burnett - still funny after all these years,my Mom loves the old Carol Burnett episodes. This is a high quality release.
5,A picture is worth a thousand words.,"I bought South Africa (Eyewitness Travel Guides) and have found it very helpful. We already had an itinerary planned and this guide showed us where we would be visiting, the weather, and gave useful background on each area. This guidebook gives pictorial views of historical sites, attractions etc. This was enlightening information, some of the places we will be going are far larger in area than we would have imagined. Also the attraction maps will help us keep oriented so time is not wasted being lost. With this guide and a good detail map of South Africa we gained insight about the length of travel needed each day. The biggest plusses were the pictures and drawings, they really are worth a thousand words as used in this guide. There is plenty of ""survival"" information; important phone numbers, medical suggestions, lodging recommendations etc. Lots of fun to read just for enjoyment!"
4,"beautiful photos, good start","This was one of several books we bought for a trip to South Africa. The book itself is beautiful-good photos, concise descriptions, good background and is itself a keepsake of the trip. It provided some good background and historical information about the different areas of the country and what to expect, but it is not the kind of book that will tell you all you need to know about where to stay, what time the trains run, etc. It is a great start to get excited about where you're going, but should only be considered as an adjunct to another book (like Frommers or Lonely Planet) that provides all the nuts and bolts information you actually need to travel there. If you have both, you're in great shape, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it ahead of time."
3,Eyewitness Travel South Africa 2007,"I have thoroughly enjoyed using the Eyewitness Travel guides in Europe and assumed that this one would be as good. Not so. We spent 2 weeks traveling from Capetown to Port Elizabeth mostly on the Garden Route. Everything in the book was good, but too much was missing. In particular, I was appalled to learn that the District Six Museum in Capetown was not even listed! This is the only museum in the city that chronicles the experience of 85% of the people during the Apartheid years. I have written to the publishers and hope that the new edition (Aug. 2009) contains more that reflects the cultures and communities of South Africa's black African population!"
4,Getting Ready for South Africa,"This guide provides a delightful collection of lovely photographs of South Africa. Skimmed or savored they serve to whet the prospective traveler's appetite, and provide a good preliminary description of the country that will be most valuable in formulating an itinerary.The guide does not, however, provide much of the nitty-gritty detail that is necessary to manage the details of his or her trip. Taken in company with one of the more detailed guides, this can be a real asset in developing your vacation."
5,Getting traver feaver...,"It really shows more than others only tell you as it says on the front cover.I love the way the book tells and shows not only the tourist traps but also lot of animals and other things good to know about South Africa.If you are planning to travel there, I recommend it, also the size is ok when packing the suitcase..."
1,"South Africa, eyewitness travel guides","Basically this is a useless book. It gives a broad overview of very basic things. It is in NO WAY a travel guide. It does, however, have nice pictures! I returned to book!"
4,A teaser but great none the less.,I have never seen such an amazing compilation of manuscripts and calligraphic examples. I was blown away. The only problem is that the dang pages are so small!! It seems like some detail is lost. This is a big problem for anyone who wants to master some the writing techniques. The Mira calligraphea is the same dang size so no help there either. If anyone knows where I can find larger views please let me know!!!! vinson.gracia@gmail.com
2,Near miss,"I think the idea of this book was a good one, however the images were not that inspiring for me. Minimalism can be very spiritual if done with the right stuff. There are few pages that fold out making panoramic views of, well...uninspired images. This is not to say the book is a total dud. I found some of it useful.For a book that takes a similar approach, take a look at ""Country and Modern: Contemporary Interiors for Rural Settings (Hardcover)"" by Dinah Hall. The book, the images and ideas are more in the lines of the ""truth to material"" philosophy. This is a book I don't get tired of looking at. ""Minimum"" will just sit in the bookcase doing nothing I am afraid."
2,minumum coherence,"I liked the idea of this book, but the execution seems pretty forced. Bunches of photos -- many of which are not particularly interesting -- that presumably illustrate minimum design. But it all seems a bit random and incoherent to me. Pawson may be a fine architect, but I don't think any clear understanding of minimum design is advanced here."
3,A book on minimalist architecture with little Pawson's work,"John Pawson did an great job of exploring minimalist architecture. What was missing was a focus on Pawson's work itself. I would have liked to seen something like the book ""Richard Meier Houses"" that focused entirely on John Pawson's work. As it turned out ""Minimum"" contains little of Pawson's work."
1,Broken,"I founded my Minimum book with several pages broken and unstucked binding, so I'm very dissatisfied with the product (not with the content)"
2,not that great,"After reading these reviews, I was eager to read this book. As a twenty-something Chicagoan who's lived in the city for four years now since college, I have to say it's not an accurate portrayal of our generation. True, many are unsatisfied in life, but they don't talk about it the way the Trixies and Chads in this book do. I found the conversations totally unrealistic, which is unfortunate since it's a dialogue-driven book. If these characters are supposed to be true Trixies and Chads, they wouldn't be so pseudo-intellectual. Maybe U of I journalists talk that way, but it's not representative of the typical 20-something. It gets 2 stars for its dead-on descriptions of Lincoln Park & Wrigleyville though."
5,Banks' Resume lands author job as voice of the people,"Resume is akin to The Great Gatsby in theme, focusing on beautiful wealthy young people graduating college and coming into the real world. Their vices and the problems of 21st century America come head to head and the question is, ""Can they save themselves from themselves?""Environmental descriptions transcend Resume into a period piece and a travelogue for Chicago and U.I.C. as well.Even the opinionated will be pleased to let Banks speak for them in Resume."
5,Cute story with adorable illustrations,"I love all of the Gertie and Friends books, but this one is probably my favorite. The illustrations are simple, and yet full of interesting tidbits you can help your child find. It's amazing how expressive these little goslings are. I appreciate that the story is short and sweet. My daughter is not yet old enough to enjoy longer stories, but she is fully able to sit through this one."
5,Amazing condition. Perfect for little hands.,The size and shape of the book is perfect for my 2 year old to hold. Great quality. Wish all board books were this nice.
4,Clever and great for young audiences,"I have a son who is soon to be two. We read a lot of children's books, and it always amazes me at how many don't flow very well in terms of text. The text in this book is simple but very well-written. I am only giving it 4 stars only because I believe it would have been a better book for a younger child. He loved it for a short period of time, but a year ago it would have interested him more. It's a great book to use when your child is just beginning to be interested in having books read to him/her."
2,wondrous christmas review,We were a bit disappointed in this Cd. The American Christmas Carol by Tim Janis was fantastic. Very anointed and inspiring. We were hoping this new Cd of Tim Janis' would be similarily inspiring. Unfortunately it did not touch the heart as The American Christmas Carol had.
5,Blink182 ROCKS!,hey watup everyone! i definitley think everybody should own this CD--it is my fav. CD in the WORLD. its an awesome CD with great songs--anyone who doesnt own it should buy it right NOW...or else you'll never know what your missing:) peace-jenny
3,They are still alright,"When I first heard blink182, it was the song dammit and I was hooked. Every song on Dude Ranch was good and I enjoyed listening to it. When I heard about Enema of the State, I was happy and was excited to get the new CD. The song ""whats my age again"" was good on the radio and i bought the CD immediatly. It was pretty good. But then I heard the song M&M's from Chesire Cat and my whole view changed. They are more of a pop band than punk now. They all are stuck up. They even have a link to be on TRL on their webpage. This made me VERY angry that such a great band was trying to be trendy. But they are still funny, immiture, witty, and great mucisians and the music on the CD is still good, just not as good as the older stuff."
4,Awesome!,"i really love this cd! my friends got me hooked on Blink-182 recently and they bought me this one for my birthday...and i love it! i remember when All The Small Things was played endlessly on the radio, and I really liked the song, but I never knew who it was by. When i was listening to this CD and heard all the small things come on i was so happy i finally found what band played that song! if you like blink-182, you NEED this cd!"
4,Interesting,"Ok, this is a pretty good cd, I got it a while back when it first came out, [in june]. What I can't believe is that they made an edited version, I mean this damn cd doesn't even have an explicit lyric warning. I've been with Blink 182 from the begining, and they really are great, [and great looking] but can we say ""sell-outs""?"
2,THIS CD IS OK BUT IM GETTING TIRD OF THE IMMATURE MUSIC,"THIS CD IS OK BUT ITS WAY TOO CHILDISH THESE GUYS HAVENT GOT MATURE AT ALL AND THE SONGS ARE KIND OF DUMB AND VULGAR, STILL THIS CD HAS ITS GOOD MOMENTS LIKE WHATS MY AGE AGAIN, ALL THE SMALL THINGS AND ALIENS EXIST"
5,"Ahh, my boys are at it again!","About 6 years since they released Buddha and finally, finally, Blink is getting some recognition! Enema of the State rocks, especially Going Away to college and The Party Song. The c.d. is so great, but I still can't decide which album is the best they've released...such decisions! And contrary to popular belief, Blink is punk, baby! Marry me, Mark A. Hoppus!hehehe. Good job guys."
2,What happened?,"I wouldnt go as far to say that they completely sold out because they didnt. Its just not their best effort. If you've never listened to punk before buy this. If your into punk dont. Its funny, the beats are awesome, but the lyrics just suck. Cheshire Cat and Dude Ranch were better. Buy those or just buy what you want its your money. It's a good CD to buy to make the transition from alternative to POP punk."
4,waste of money,i love blink 182 but this cd is a waste of money. it'd be cheaper to buy the enema cd and the live album and you'd get more songs. just a word of caution to all you blink fans.
3,Good Cd. Wrong sellouts,"This cd is quite good actually. But the fact that they became so popular and trendy sucks! If you're a 10 years old punk-wannabe, go ahead and buy the cd it'll make you popular. But if you're not, buy mxpx, green day or living end. Thanks for listening."
3,I thought these guys were fast.,"I love the whole album. I think it's great. The one flaw is also the reason I gave this album 3 stars. What happened to the fast punk beat? Did they forget how to do it? I think Tom and Mark are really trying to make more money than to stay true to their original sound. There's only a couple songs on the CD that have the fast beat, but none of them keep it up through the whole song. They've gotten really good, and their drummer is amazing. Check out the drum roll on Going Away To College. Unfortunatly, Blink has gone a little to MTV. I look forward to their next effort. I have a feeling it'll be a lot faster and more energetic after all the flak they'll get from this album, kinda like NOFX's Heavy Petting Zoo. This album really reminds me of MXPX's Slowly Going The Way Of The Buffalo. More radio friendly than punk. Blink's not my favorite anymore, but they are still up there."
5,BLINK STILL ROCKS,"I DONT KNOW WHY ALL THOSE PEOPLE SAY THAT BLINK ARE POSERS.THEYRE NOT POP THEYRE STILL PUNK AND STILL THE BEST. ESPECIALLY ON THIS CD. I MEAN IT ROCKS ITS THE BEST CD, I WOULD OF GIVEN IT A SIX.ANOTHER THING I WANNA SAY IS THAT I THINK THEY ARE SOOOO HOT ESPECIALLY TRAVIS THAT NEVER TALKS.WELL ANYWAYS IF YOUR LOOKING FOR AGREAT PUNK CD ITS ENEMA.....BLINK STILL ROCKS!"
4,I haven't heard it but it's cool.,"Yeah, i have not yet heard this cd, but it's still cool. YEAH! LESS THAN JAKE AND BLINK 182 RULE!"
4,Enema of the State rocks!,"I was never really a big fan of Blink 182 before, but after hearing ""What's my age again?"" on the radio, I loved that song so much that I was dying to hear other songs by them. I never doubted the quality of their new c.d. because many of my peers love them and since I have the same taste in music, I expected that I would love their songs too. Well, I was right and I have to say that this c.d. is one of the best I've ever gotten. With the exception of a couple songs, it's absolutely perfect. I truly recommend it because it's not often that you find a c.d. where you like almost all the songs."
5,"Better than ""Dude Ranch""","Enema of the State surpasses all of Blink 182's previous work. Their songs are amazing. This CD rocks. Get it, it's a must buy."
5,Don't call this POP. This is ROCK,"I consider pop backstreet boys, n sync, and groups like that. This is still Blink- relatively faced paced, fun music. That is what Blink is about. I don't consider this a ""sellout"" cd because if they sold out they would be a ""boy band"". As for the CD, it is great. All the songs are great and I think you should buy this. THIS IS NOT POP, BLINK 182 ACTUALLY PLAYS INSTRUMENTS. AND THEY PLAY THEM PRETTY GOOD IN FACT THEY PLAY THEM GREAT."
5,Going away to buy it,"I had heard alot about this album ""Enema of the state"". My friends told me about how good this album, so I bought it. I must admit, this is one of the best albums that I have EVER bought in my life. It is well worth the money. ""Adam's Song"" is a song which many teenagers can relate their life too. It is about depression and how you suddenly feel like commiting suicide but you just have to know that better days will come. ""What's my age again"" is one of the best songs becaues it is funny and enjoyable and it's just an awesome song to put on when you are just in your room with nothing to do. The guitars make the song sound awesome and the words are the funniest. This is definately an album every Blink 182 fan should buy, definately this is a five out of five!"
4,Consistancy is the key,"This CD is great because it has no highs and lows. None of the songs over shadow the others and none are so bad you skip them. I don't know whether the terms ""punk"" or ""rock"" apply to music anymore but if you like three guys who play about 10 different chords at a pretty quick tempo, then you'll like this CD."
1,Ummmm....wha????,"Help. Bad music created while Blink 182 gave eachother enemas, so I think it is the most appropriate name for this CD."
5,This is the best CD by blink yet.,whats my age again and adams song are the best songs and the group rock
4,a little disappointment...,"I am tired of all these damn trendy teenyboppers who watch TRL all day just liking Blink 182 because of WMAA? I have been with them since Cheshire Cat and so far my fave is Dude Ranch. but i guess it is a cool CD, but i miss scott's crazy drum beats. travis is a good drummer too, but i just miss mad dog :( and stop calling them Blink!! Blink and Blink 182 are two TOTALLY DIFFERENT BANDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,very immature,this is very a immature cd and i think these guys have the ability to produce something better. They have much to be done. Better luck next time.
5,THE BEST CD EVER!!!!!!!!,THIS CD IS THE BEST. I LOVE ALL THE SONGS ON IT. THIS IS THE FIRST CD I EVER BOUGHT THAT I LOVE EVERY SINGLE SONG.
4,Blink 182's first big hit.,"This CD is one of Blink 182's best CD's. Even though most of the lyrics are not laudable, they still give the songs a good rythm and beat, allowing the listener to really get into the song. Each song on the CD is unique and fresh, except for ""All the Small Things,"" which was on their previous CD, ""Dude Ranch."" The CD is not too short and gives you plenty of Blink 182. Each song has a lot of bass, good vocals by both Tom and Mark, and excellent rythms played by their new drummer, at the time, Travis. The enhanced Cd feature is a definite plus, allowing you to see the behind the scenes video from the photo shoot for the cover of the CD. Overall the CD is well worth the price, and is a definite must have for all Blink 182, or punk rock fans."
4,Last good album,"Enema of the State marks the last album they are a real punk sounding band. I think this is a great cd, I don't care what you people think that just call em a bunch of backstreet girls, this is good. TOYPAJ then marks the end of blink 182 greatness."
1,punk fan from jersey,"This cd just plain sucks. I was a fan of Blink 182 for a long time and being a fan of pop punk in general (New Foung Glory, Green Day, Ataris, etc.), I was really pumped for this album. Cheshire Cat was an absolutley amazing pop punk album, probably the best pop punk album ever. Buddah and Dude Ranch were also great albums. So, knowing this and hearing What's My Age Again which was a decent single, I expected some good stuff. Boy was I dissapointed. The album is filled just bad songs that disgrace the name of punk. If Blink wants to make this music they should at least let their new fan base of 13 year old girls know that THIS ISN'T PUNK. It disposable garbage that old fans of Blink shouldn't even consider picking up. Let's just hope that their next album heads back towards their roots"
1,Sid Vicious would be shooting up heroin in his grave if...,"Tell me, how in the world we went from great punk bands like The Dead Kennedys, Misfits(not newfits), Cramps, Black Flag, and such, to Blink 182? Punk used to mean something, it was the thought of noncomformity, of rebellion, and to Anarchy. Now we got a couple of poser punkers who go out and play some of the worst punk songs in the world. Now mind you, that this is only on the recent albums. They're older stuff was more true to punk then ""All the Small things"" Yet another group killed by the MTV genre. Speaking of which.. you ever notice that the heaviest of bands hardly get played on MTV?"
1,Not Punk by any means,"I'm not entirely sure why this is called punk. The music certainly doesn't show it. And the lyrics! Don't even get me started!! The guitar and bass sound far too poppy, but the drumming isn't terrible. In fact, their drummer has quite a bit of talent. He should form another band. Punk is bands like NOFX,Pennywise,Rancid and old Offspring( new 'Spring{Americana,Conspiracy of One}sucks).In fact, go buy ""Smash"" by the aforementioned Offspring. And while you're at it, check out early Silverchair and anything by the great Nirvana. Those bands were punk in the public eye that WEREN'T poppy or sell-outs.Avoid these guys like the plague."
1,Meaningless sell-out crap,"Blink 182 once had some integrity as a novelty, and occasionally good alternative band. With this effort, Blink sells out in terrific fassion, intentionally making a record that appeals to pop and alternative radio. Not as catchy as ""Dude Racnh,"" this CD is not worth your 15 bucks, as it is pure crap through - and - through."
1,They've hit rock bottom,"I loved dude Ranch because every song was amazing and catchy...and i loved Chesire Cat more because it was true punk. So when I got this album I almost died. Enema of the State is the biggest piece of garbage since the new Less than Jake album B&B. The only decent songs are the Party Song, Anthem and Dont leave me. Blink should be ashamed of themselves trying to pass off All the Small Things as punk. I almost didnt buy the live Mark Tom and Travis Show but in that live album it redeems Enema of the State somewhat. If you are a true punk fan and not some stupid 12 year old whose loves NSYNC and Smashmouth go get some real punk bands like Dropkick Murphy, New Found Glory, Less than Jake (there old stuff), MXPX or NOFX or if you want to experiance the real Blink-182 before they sold there souls go buy Dude Ranch of Chesire Cat"
1,Product of the enema,The only thing worse than pop music is pop music disguised as punk music. Absolutely horrible. This rocks as hard as a used teabag.
5,Enema Of The State Rocks!,I think this is the best blink-182 album out. This really starts to show their maturity. I would really get this album if you like blink-182 or just want to hear something new.1. Dumpweed - 7/102. Don't Leave Me - 6/103. Aliens Exsist - 8/104. Going Away to College - 8/105. What's My Age Again? - 7/106. Dysentery Gary - 9/107. Adam's Song - 10/10 (My favorite song on this CD)8. All The Small Things - 9/109. The Party Song - 10/1010. Mutt - 7/1011. Wendy Clear - 8/1012. Anthem - 9/10I would recommend you buying this album!
1,"Oh yeah, it sure is like an enema...","... it sure cleaned my pockets out. I used to like Blink, i had the first two poser albums, and this killed the band for me, it is so bad i tore up the cover, and set my tape of it on fire. Do not buy this! Even when i listened to this poppy stuff, i hated this."
2,Blink 182 are SELLOUTS!!!!!!,"sure, you can say what you want, but Blink is just another sellout band now. there are maybe 2 good songs on this whole CD, and most songs sound the same. i dont know about you but i am sick of seeing good bands sellout. pass this cd up and get dude ranch, some early blink when they were actually good."
5,So Awesome!!,"Blink 182 has now just been introduced to me by their song ""What's My Age Again"" and when I bought the CD I knew that I had a hit album. It was the last one in stock and I found out why! This is the kind of CD you can pop into your CD player and just listen to the whole way through. It really makes you want to run around the house screaming- if you like that sort of thing. Blink 182's new CD ""Enema of the State"" is sure to fit your CD collection. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"
4,don't call them sell outs,ok well this album is a little more poppy instead of punky but it still has punk roots. I would not call them sell outs. i think that those are too strong words. If you like any other blink you will enjoy this. Cause to tell you the truth Chesire Cat was slow punk too just like Enema.
5,They have done it again,"I bought this cd when it first came out and had been anticipating its release for a real long time...blink 182 has done it again!!! what other band would strip down to nothing for their fans in the ""whats my age again?"" video...it rules...and anyone who disses it sucks..."
2,blink 182-enema of the state cd,"ok,to get started,i'm not really a big fan of punk rock.the only punk rock cds i own is this and sum 41's al killer no filler.i bought this cd for the songs ""all the small things"",""adam's song"",and ""what's my age again?"".at first i liked them,but after a few listenings,they got old.all punk rock does to me.it's just boring.it's still in my cd case,i listen to it SOMETIMES,but not much.don't buy this if you dont like punk."
5,Pop crap,"I hate this cd it is pop not punk like all their old stuff. Blink 182 was the best band in the world before this pop peice of junk they made. Buy all their old albums, not this! O yeah i gave it 5 stars because blink WAS a great band and i thought it would be only appropriate to give this cd although it doesnt deserve it. Nothing against the guys, but you really need to get back to your old punk ways."
4,This Is Good Music!,"Blink 182 is great! I'm not a hard-core Blink fan, but I reccommend this CD to anyone!"
1,bleghhh,"ive liked blink for a long time, before they ever hit the mtv scene. i was really disappointed with this album. their music has changed so much. i am ashamed to have even bought this cd. dont worry, im not going to go into this tirade about whether or not theyre punk, or what the definition of punk is. frankly, i sick of hearing about it anyway. but i will say this. blink has strayed afar from there roots. i loved the boys, but i think i will leave them to all the 12 year old girls who say theyre so HOT. if you want a blink cd, buy cheshire cat. dont buy this cd."
5,Blink 182,"This is a really cool neat CD. I love blink 182 and when I first heard them It was the dude ranch CD and I diddn't like them untill I heard all the small things and then I got the edited version of the CD for christmas and I loved it and then I accidentally mixed up my edited copy of the cd with my friends unedited cd and I realized that there isn't that much cussing in the cd only in about 2 songs and they say the ""F"" word only like 5 or 6 times in the cd and those 5 or 6 are only in 2 songs, Blink 182 dosen't cuss as much in 4 cd's as limp bizkit does in one two minute song. In conclusion this blink 182 CD opened my eyes to the punk world and now it is my favorite kind of music! -Patrick S. Lawler P.S. My e-mail is patrick@thelawlers.com"
1,Absolute Opposite of What Punk is About,"I feel that punk is about not selling out. Blink-182 missed the target by a lot with this CD. The lyrics and videos appeal to teenybopper teenage girls, and their attempt at being 'funny' and 'cute' is horribly nauseating. One of the lead singer's voice is horribley screechy and hard to stomach. Punk-rockers: Stay away from this CD. Teenybopper Girls: I think you'll like it. Bottom line: Not punk, annoying lead singer, no talent, 'punks' trying to be 'cute' and 'funny'. Now ask yourself: Is it really worth it? Do I want to be another sheep? No, you sure as hell don't. stay away from his disk..."
1,They suck big balls,I wanted travis barker to die a horrible death and blink-182 with him too. There musc sucks so much shaqs music sounds way better.
1,A terrible version of Greenday's INSOMNIAC,"In short, this is a CD for morons. A Greenday CD without the revolutionary attitude, good lyrics, and a good feel. I beg you, buy INSOMNIAC by Greenday, DOOKIE by Greenday, or the best CD there is, NEVERMIND by Nirvana. Don't become a statistic, listening to songs anout what my age is again, buy NEVERMIND or DOOKIE, listen to real music. Please."
1,the poor cannon all out of powder,"i used to work construction before i got a job as a writer. this band had a hit on the local teeny bop sell out alterna-mall-rock station. it's terrible: thorough testimony to the worthlessness of 90% of popular music. each time it came over the airwaves (every two hours) i felt like someone had given me a pill designed to induce a knd of kiddie schizophrenia. don't buy this album. seriously, you'll be sorry."
4,Blink 182 is the NOT the N'Sync of Punk,"People in the punk/metal scene need to get over their ""holier then thou"" attitude why do people freak out when their favorite band goes from playing ""6 bands Eight bucks"" shows to $35 dollar concerts. We WANT them to be sucessful, so you knew Blink when Scott Raynor was the drummer and you tortured your parents with ""Depends"" off Cheshire Cat that doesn't mean they're sell-outs now that employees of the GAP like Blink. Britney Spears and N'Sync don't even write their own songs. Blink NOT only WRITES their own music, but get this...THEY ACTUALLY PLAY THEIR OWN INSTRUMENTS! How many Backstreet Boys can do that! No matter what you listen to, buy this CD. Blink 182 is a versatile band you have ""What's my age.."" and ""Adam's Song"" on one album showing you Blink's playful and meaningful sides. This band has come along way from their early days and this CD showcases it's maturity while sticking to their punk roots. Blink 182 has grown up...I wonder have you?"
3,great band sellout album,"I am a gigantic fan of Blink 182, but this c.d is light and pop-ish. Compared to their first major label release ""Dude Ranch"", the band seems to be trying to target 11 year old girls, and by doing so are forgetting their punk-rock roots. This c.d. isn't bad, but as i said it's fairly superficial. They prove me right with songs like ""all the small things"", and ""going away to college"" (gag me!) i hope for better from this band in the future!"
2,"kiddos, this is NOT punk rock","If yer looking for real ""punk"" bands, this ain't it...this is cutesy pop rock, that's all. I'm no fan,I just wanna say ""All The Small Things"" is the only song I really like cuz it's kind of a rip-off of the Jesus & Mary Chain's song ""Head On"" from 1989, so if you know what song that is, give the 2 a listen & you'll see the striking similarities. Cuz when I first heard this song on the radio, I had no idea who it was, & could've sworn it was some unknown 80's song, so maybe these guys have some 80's influences, good for them. ""What's my age again"" gets on my nerves though cuz radio & mtv killed it. And guys from the band, yer funny yes, but PLEEEEZ put some clothes on yer videos!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,i miss intelligent punk,"And this album ain't gonna help matters any. The musical intelligence barely exceeds the lyrical intelligence - which is pretty much nonexistent. Catchy melodies make it more tolerable than crap like Limp Bizkit, but not much. This is just immature adolescent party music; it's amusing that a previous reviewer actually tried to distinguish Blink 182 from Britney Spears. There's no truly significant distinction. It's all meaningless, artless, and inconsequential. How sad that Blink 182 are modern superstars and still hardly anyone knows who great, innovative punk bands like Gang of Four were."
5,Blink 182 knew what they are doing.,"In, this album they knew what they were doing. There are songs with Mark, songs with Tom, and songs with both of them. Every song has something to enjoy about it and you won't find yourself skipping bad tracks that often. For punk fans, this is the stuff."
1,Piece of Crap,"im gonna be short and to the point: this cd completely ruined blink-182 for me...even if they made another record up to par with cheshire cat, i will never like them ever again"
1,SELLOUTS!,"I am sick of pop-punk...Want real punk? Listen to Sublime, Pennywise, the Misfits, NOFX, Ten Foot Pole, or any other punk band with talent!"
1,uggghhh.....,"this makes me sick. All these people pretending they are punks. THIS IS NOT PUNK! it is total pop. I am a huge punk fan, and this sugar-coated mindless corporate garbage being passed off as punk is sad. These songs can't even be passed off as pop-punk, which is not all that great. If you want to listen to real punk, listen to Dead Kennedys, Dropkick Murphys, Against All Authority, Anti-Flag, Minor Threat, Suicide Machines (old), Nofx etc. Sorry for offending anyone, but I just had to get that off my chest."

5,Blink Rules,"This is their best CD yet!!!!!Dumpweed- a good song with a great pace!Don't leave me- not their best, but good!Aliens exist- I really like this song, I think tom does too!going away to collage- great song one of my favs!what's my age again- a funny song, that's fun too listen too!Dysentary Gary- lots of profainity, funny thoughadam's song- sad and meaningful, this has got to be one of their only serious songs; I love it though.All the small things- awesome song; my fav on the whole CD!Party song- kinda wierd, funny!mutt- great and up beat; got a good pointwendy clear- ok; not my fav.ANTHEM- love it, funny Iloooove it when he talks about Bob humping the dog!!!"
5,these guys are incredible!,"Blink 182 are gods, they have the best music, ""what's my age again"" is just plain platnium music. . . .you should really get this cd, it's definatly worth it!"
5,Awesome!,The first time I heard this Cd was on the radio it was pretty cool. I love their music! It's soo great.
3,"sellouts, maybe; bad, no","Blink 182 has definately changed their music style (since buddah and cheshire cat), but they still rock. So what if they are sellouts (that's why only 3 stars), so what if they have gone more pop/alternative? So what if they aren't Pennywise or NOFX? I still think their music is good, though maybe not as punk."
2,A ignorant attempt at stardom,"I'll admit it... before I got this CD , I didd'nt liston to Blink..or Punk altogether. I got Enema..loved it..then got Dude Ranche..and it was tehn that I realized how lame Enema was. It seems like Blink got obcessed with making money..and lost all interest in the fans. Sure- the songs are great.. all the tracks are equal to any new One Hit Wonder's song..and thats the problem. I recomend this album to a beginner Blinkiot..more then Dude Ranch- although the latter is a lot better . Blink 182- What about the fans?"
2,I'm starting to change my mind about Blink,"Earlier this year, i wrote a reveiw giving this cd a great name. But as the time has gone by I have gotten quite sick of the Blink 182 I am now seeing every second on MTV, doing dumb commercials, and changing their sound just to be big. Man, I am really upset to see a group of funny guys who used to masters at the punk rock scene sellout. Their music used to be so awsome, but now, it's cheezy pop with dumb lyrics. The songs are catchy, i have to admit, and i listen to this album when i'm really in the mood, but still I thought Blink could've done a lot better with their old sound. I mean Dammit was an awsome single, and if they would've just stuck to the Chesire Cat and Dude Ranch sound they could've made punk rock huge. I still haven't lost hope completely for Blink. Maybe they will go back to how they were a few years ago, but right now i'm dissappointed to see my favorite band go down the drain. All you punkers out there, stick with NOFX for now."
2,Green Day Wannabes,"Blink 182 tries. They have some good songs on this CD like Dumpweed, Aliens Exsist and the Party Song. Their previous recording Dude Ranch is a very good album and I recommend it. But then like many other bands, they turned pop like many other bands (some I hate to admit like Offspring). On this CD they try to keep the same three power cords and it makes a majority of the songs Pop Punk if you want REAL PUNK to stay alive listen to Green Day and The Offspring."
4,blink 182,I just recently got this cd (Enema of the State) for Christmas. It's a great cd and I love all their punk on there. 'The Party Song' is a cool song too.
3,Decent album,"Blink 182 has made a Cd worth play on the radio a couple times, not every day on the radio and mtv. There are MUCH better bands out there. I can't stand people who just listen to mtv music. Although blink 182 is not quite like the fabrications of the Boy bands, there are better bands out there like THE HIPPOS."
2,In memory of...Punk.,"""Blink 182's first cds ruled. they lost it this time. They used to be my favorite band until now."
4,This band picks up where Green Day left off....,"Although most fans will say that Blink-182 really sold out with this album (and I won't really argue with them), Enema of the State is truly one of the most catchy recordings of the past decade. It's so popular because each song has the potential to make the 14-22 crowd identify with it. Surprisingly, only one of the three best tracks (Dysentery Gary, Anthem, Adam's Song) gets any radio play. Definitely an album worth buying -- there isn't any filler material here."
3,WHAT HAPPENED?,"Blink182 were punk, and still are, but this cd isnt all that great! I love Blink182. I've been a fan since Buhdda. I will always be a fan, but this isn't their greatest work. Yeah, Dumpweed is kinda punk, but the radio-loved song, ""All The Small Things"" shows how MTV have changed this punk trio. I was disappointed with this CD. I was expecting more punk sounds. MTV and all teeny teen boppers changed their sound. I still love Blink182, but not this CD."
1,sorry,"Sorry to be the arrogant jerk who writes the downer review and has all the holier/hipper than thou advice about music, but in reading the rewiews here I saw many people express some very positive ideas regarding a band that isn't very good. For funny intelligent and fun pop/punk see the Dead Milkmen. For disrespectful ranting hilarious pure punk, see the Dead Kennedys. And for brilliant hilarious perverse fun, see the Frogs. All these bands have talent and humor in their work that Blink simply can't equal. Besides, why buy something all your friends already have. Find something your parents haven't heard of."
3,WHAT HAPPENED?!,"I'm a huge fan of Blink 182.Their stuff on Cheshire Cat and Dude Ranch we're awesome and I'm not saying that this cd is HORRIBLE,but this is not punk rock.This cd is as boy bandish as Nsync but its not bad.Adams song,Going Away to College, and Wendy Clear are good songs but,All the Small Things is as low as Bye Bye Bye.Since we can assume that Blink is coming out with a new cd sometime in the future,I will make sure that I borrow it from someone else before i but it.This is boy bandish enough....I dont know how bad the new cd might be if there IS going to be a new cd sometime in the future."
3,a downstep,"This CD is definetely not Blink's best. Sure it's a great CD with a lot of really cool songs but I think Blink became less of a mature fun punk band and released Enema satisfying little immature boys. The best songs on the album are Aliens Exist, going away to college and adam's song. Most of the other songs are about the same dumb thing, althought they sound cool, this CD isn't quite as good as their earlier stuff- if you have their other CDs I'd reccomend you buy this CD because in the end it is a good album but if you're new to the Blink scene and wondering which CD to buy, I wouldn't start with this one, I'd reccomend Buddha, or Dude Ranch."
2,mixed feelings about blink 182,"blink 182 is not a punk band. They are sellouts to the punk industry and a discrace to punks everywhere. Thats not to say the music isnt good....because it is good, its just that you dont get that same feeling on enema of the state as you do on the older albums. Its a good cd to add to a collection of POP cds."
2,Blink182,"Blink 182's Enema of the State is truly not the greatest CD in the world. It is probably the worst CD i have ever owned. Though, there are a few great songs on the CD, such as Whats my Age Again, and Adams Song, the rest of the CD is junk. Do yourself a favor and dont buy it."
3,Nice... But far from being their best album,"Even though I'm a big fan to thrash/death metal and hardcore music, I also like bands that plays punk style rock music. Blink 182 is a good band, their music is relaxing and smooth compared to heavy metal bands, and the lyrics crack me up. But I was a bit disappointed with this album... most of the songs sounds the same, and the guitar riffs are really simple and never seems to change... Anyways, this is a decent album, if you're a blink 182 or a punk rock fan, then you'll love this album...Nice cd cover... :)"
3,My Review,"Okay, I'll be short and to the point. Although this album is great, I just don't think it lives up to previous albums (namely, Dude Ranch). Sure, they have some great songs on here, such as 'Mutt' and the unstoppable radio hit 'What's my Age Again?', but I can't really listen through the entire CD over and over again. Also, I think a lot of people now are loving the CD just because of the guys' looks, but you have to see beyond that, into the music. I think Dude Ranch is a bit better, but if you really love the bands' music, you should consider this one too. I liked most of the songs on here, but you have to like this sort of music to really appreciate it."
5,Blinkin' around,"Who the blink cares if it's not a pure punk, when the music blows you away with its rythm, when the tunes are so catchy that you can't get them out of your head day and night, and the lyrics are so sweet that you (or some of your girlfriends) may even cry sometimes. This is Blink again and this time better than ever.All The Small Things, What's My Age Again, and Adam's Song are the burying hits, unmistakingly overplayed by radio stations and taken to MTV. The platinum part of the cd.Anthem, Aliens Exist, Don't Leave Me, Mutt, and Wendy Clear are another series of brilliant tunes and funny lyrics. A golden classics of Blink - may we call it so? Let's do it guys if it doesn't hurt your feelings.The rest on the cd is worth the above. Probably even better, who knows. It's up to you anyway.The cd is a real breakthrough, you must know it. The best album of the recent times. Don't even think of not buying it.P.S. Hey, Blink, any plans for Russia tour? Bloodhound Gang have already been here."
2,An attempt to sound like Green Day,"That's what this album left me with. I guess I have to be fair about it though considering Green Day would only release a greatest hits compilation between 1997's ""Nimrod"", and 2004's ""American Idiot"". However, I found this to be a mediocre album. It does thrash I'll say that much, and the guitar is way beyond aggressive, but the vocals sound like a prepuberescent teen's vocals.....very whiny, and trying to sound tough. I also had a hard time following this album as it seemed like they played almost the same song after leaving off the last one. The album cover is sexy that's a plus, but not worth my money. This is for those who never heard of Green Day, but chances are if you never heard of Green Day you would never have heard of these bums either."
1,this cd sucks,"hi, blink 182 used to be good, now look at them. you see all those preppy abercrombie and fich kids with this cd. the songs on this cd all suck. BLINK-182 call themselves punk rock, yet put there stuff on MTV and commercial radio. if you want some quality blink get buddah"
1,enemy to my ears,"Quit buying this garbage, here's a list of bands worth buying; NEW BOMB TURKS, SWINGIN NEAKBREAKERS, HAGFISH, VON ZIPPERS, SUPERSUCKERS, ZEKE, TEENGENERATE, HELLACOPTERS, GOTOHELLS, BOTTOMFEEDERS, there, now you have no excuse on what you should buy. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on bands like blink-182 because they are worthless."
1,SELLOUTS OF 1999,"This cd is terrible, and I've never heard it before in my life. These guys should get the award of ""biggest sellouts of 1999"". I hope these guys don't consider themselves a punk band anymore, because punk is never about selling out. I hate MTV! Don't buy this!"
1,ANOTHER MTV ASSKISSER,"This CD is one of the best examples of what not to sound like if you study a musical instrument or are learning to sing. Of course, BLINK 182 does not do either, but that is just the reality of modern music. The masses have accepted music made by so-called musicians that cannot sing or play instruments well. However, I guess the masses have no choice much of the time. Too bad, isn't it?"
3,Decent if you're a wannabe punk...,"I started out listening to Blink 182 almost two years ago. Then I got into REAL punk rock. I own 3 Blink cds and love them all, but I absolutely hate seeing them at number one on MTV. My advice is to get this cd, but don't pretend that you're a punk, 'cuz Blink 182 just isn't Punk Rock anymore."
1,the only thing these guys have is humor,"their music isn't great and sounds the same as a bunch of lookout! and fat records bands.they are funny i will admit but basically are a green day clone when they are trying to be funny.yeah they play fast but that's no reason to say they are a punk band.for some punk that is true listen to sham 69,stiff little fingers,dropkick murphy's,rancid,bouncing souls,anti-flag,u.s. bombs,adicts,u.k. subs and tons more.all that bubblegum so called pop punk blows."
1,I give it a 1 because I can't give it a -1,"This is an insult to punk. As an answer to a review a little below mine ""if you don't like it don't listen to it"", I say, I feel that it's my duty to listen to, and give a bad review to this cd. For all of you who think this is punk it isn't even close. Blink lost their edge after Cheshire Cat (an excellent CD), and they haven't gained anything except two videos on MTV and little girl fans. This is the last trash punk needs. Do yourself a favor and leave this album on the shelves."
1,punk? are you out of your mind?,"It seems that just about everything is being called ""punk"" now. Apparently, if you play ""fast, hard"" music, that makes you punk in the media's eye. Well, sorry to break it to you all...blink182 is NOT punk. The Sex Pistols and the Clash were punk. The Dead Kennedys were punk. Bikini Kill was punk. All of those bands had integrity, and they were all angry about what was happening socially at the time. Blink182 is more concerned about telling sex jokes and getting laid. Yes, a lot of true punk-bands had songs about sex...but they were more than just that. Just because your music has a raw edge, that doesn't make you punk. If you're a 13-16 year old male poseur, then by all means, buy this album. Do not buy this album if you want true punk music. If you want REAL punk, buy an album by the Sex Pistols or the Clash, not this meaningless garbage."
1,"one star to ""what's my age again?""","this album clearly identifies who blink 182's inspiration was..green day..the same three riffs over and over and over. there is one good song on this entire cd. the single.what's my age... the rest of this album is all just repetitive blabber of fake punk rock. if i could return this cd, i would... i took my chance, now i'm stuck with another cd that will collect dust."
1,The cover is the best thing about this record,"say this is the lamest, WHINEY, sing-songy frat-boy rock to get popular - maybe of all time. ...this CD just [stinks].. ..."
2,want punk? then don't buy this,"okay, i hate to sound repetitive of everyone else, but it's the truth. this album blink released is NOT punk. back in the day, blink was a pretty okay punk band. so if you're looking for blink182 punk, i suggest you buy Cheshire Cat or even Dude Ranch. But it is so obvious on how blink182 changed if you listen to Cheshire Cat and then Enema. Now they just sound like pop-wanna-be-punk or something. but, if that's what you want, then go ahead, be my guest. i just think this album is really poor, but that's coming from a punk fan."
5,Great CD,"I thought that this was a great CD. I've been a fan of Blink 182's for a really long time, and this CD only made me a bigger fan. This CD is a must for all Blink 182 fans, or anyone who likes punk/rock music."
3,What Happened?!?!?!?!,"I love Blink182, OK? I've loved them since Cheshire Cat. This CD is totally pop. They were like totally punk music, and then all of a sudden PLOP! They went pop. I still love Blink182, but this CD is just not their best. I wonder what happened. This Cd is still good, but c'mon. How can people say this a punk CD? This why most people say their sellouts, even though their not. Blink182 are not sellouts, but their true fans thought this was going to be a punk CD, whic changed everybodys minds on how they viewed Blink. I would recomend this CD to somebody who hasn't heard Dude Ranch or Cheshire Cat."
4,Blink 182,"From Whats My Age Again to Adam's song this cd is awesome. Blink 182 really holds a depth of music. The punk rockers really surprised me. This is my second review for this cd. I first didn't like it because of the cussing, but to tell you the truth, i don't really care now. These guys are hilarious and this cd holds a number of good songs. Get it if you like punk rock or alternative rock. BUY IT!"
4,Blink182 Rocks!,"When i first got it I didn't think it was a s good as LIT's ""A Place in the Sun"", but now I think it is. It's like ""blue"" by Third Eye blind; u have 2 have it like 3 days before u really love it! My fave track other than the popular tracks is track 9. It's called ""the party song."" I also like track 1,2,4,6,and 12. Buy it, all the songs are good! Peace out!"
4,Its not quite as good as dude ranch but it will do,This CD is fairly good but i dont like it as much as there first and second albums but it does have some pretty good punk songs. I thought it wasnt quite as energetic and i couldnt get pumped up riding to it but its a good cd to listen to at parties
4,the point of this album,"the mere existence of this album proves how much blink 182 have changed since the earlier albums. the point of an edited album is silly. also, the sound has changed soooooo much, it seems that as theyve grown up, they r writin bout more teenage situations, just cos thats what sells. newayz, if u want sum good pop/punk, check out the earlier albums cos they rock!"
2,Appropriate Album Title,Blink 182 must've been threatened with an enema by their record company to have pumped out this perfect pop disc. From beginning to end they pleased both teeny boppers and MCA record executives. They've proved themselves not much better than n'sync where money matters are concerned. Another classic case of money poisoning a band's music. It's a shame since they seemed more promising on their previous three albums.Maybe Scott Raynor had the right idea when he left to attend college?
1,Sell Outs,Another good example of a once good band that entered the tredy MTV TRL music scene. Its quite sad to see this once good punk band turn pop. Hopefully they will find their original music style.
2,"Amazingly, this album sucks!!!","Well, what can I say, I WAS a huge fan of these guys. Blink fans will kill me for ripping them--but hey, gotta do it. I'm a Blink fan myself. The past albums were great--they actually had melody. This album, with the exception of a couple of songs that bring this up to 2 stars rather than one, is bland and monotonous. I am very disappointed. They should be glad they released ""What's My Age"" as the first single because it's about the only good song on the album. Obviously I think this album sucks, but hey, at least they still make good videos!"
4,i liked the cd needs guitar like korns music.,"I gave the cd a 4 star because it only has a couple good songs. But all around it is a pretty good cd. I also think they need 2 sing about more realalisic things if you sing about down to earth things it makes a better song like KoRn all there song are serious unlike blink 182's. Also supporting my serious theroy ""whats my age again"" is a serious song and its there best song!. so all i am saying is they need 2 grow up and sing about more realalistic stuffp.s. "" korn is 1 of THe best younger bands out there they are better then blink 182 AND Limp Bizkit so i would buy FOLLOW THE LEADER b4 i would by ENAMA OF THE STATE . its just my opinion though"
5,This is the phattest cd,"this cd is tremendous. Starts off with the best song on the cd too Dumpweed, shes a dove, shes a ****** nitemare, unpredictable... makes me wanna go nuts, this is as good or better than dude ranch, and better than cheshire cat. I didnt think any song by Blink could top Wasting time, but dumpweed did it."
5,"A great CD, but it has its fair share of flaws","This CD is just plain great! Sure, some tracks aren't that great (Dysentery Gary, Wendy Clear), but the rest is darn good! Just take a look at the lyrics to ""What's My Age Again?"" or listen to ""All the Small Things"" and you'll fall in love with this album. The drummer does a great job on ""Aliens Exist"" and ""The Party Song"" and the guitarist rocks in ""All the Small Things."" If you are already in to Blink 182, this is definetly the CD for you! If you are new to Blink land, take this CD for a test drive. See what YOU think!"
3,"Could be better, but is good punk music","I bought this CD because I loved ""What's My Age Again"". I didn't like how in some songs, like Dumpweed, they sound different than normal, but I guess that's just Blink182. My favorite songs are What's My Age Again and the Party Song, it's pretty funny. It's deffinetly not the best punk rock CD I have listened to, and I would try Green Day. But it's okay."
5,This is the best CD ever,Ilove this CD. There are no bad songs on it. My favorite is song #8. I thing everyone should have it.
4,What's My Age Again? A great song for the Millenium,"I first heard the song ""Whats My Age Again?"" by Blink 182 on Mtv and I wasn't to thrilled about it. But as it became more popular it grew on me more and more. And now it is my favorite song and I think anyone would agree with me that it is a great song for the new Millenium."
3,Not all that great,"This cd was a big let down from dude ranch. That was the best cd. This one is a bit pitiful. There were a few good songs like mutt and dumpweed, but a lot of the others were really lame. If you want to get a cd by Blink, go for dude ranch first."
2,Not very good at all,"This cd is not very good except for ""what is my age again."" It should of had a explicit content warning on it and it didn't. If you are a person who likes to listen to just one song you should get this but other wise it really stinks. Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock are a whole lot better than this cd."
5,It's magicaly delecious,"I am not a real Blink 182 fan... untill now. This is a great album. It's not the same song over and over again... Buddah was alright, Dude ranch decent, but this album takes the cake. More like this and Blink will rule the world. It's their best effort yet. The album is magically delecious, and I suggest any fan of good music should run out and purchase it right away!"
4,Blink 182 isn't good live.,"Blink 182 isn't a good live band, so its really good that they make CD's. Their latest CD, Enema of the State, has some good songs on it The best song on the CD is the one about sleepin around, i forget the name of it. its track number 10 if that helps. I dyed my hair blonde today. Blink 182 is definetly a band that needs to stick to making CD's."
3,it's an ok CD,I wouldn't recomend this cd to anyone who wasn't a hard-core blink 182 fan it is ok but there is really only one song on it i like. i would recomend just recording the songs you like onto a tape and keep that instead of wasting you're money on a cd you may not like!
5,These guys rock,"I totally love this album. It's worth every penny you have...trust me. TOM is the best, he's hot and a great musician. I love him. Mark and Travis are great too!! I love their music to death and i suggest this for everyone!"
3,Enema of the state,"The CD contains some good songs, my favorite's being ""Adam's song"" and ""All the good things"", but some of them are a bit too much: too loud, too noisy, too punk, too hard. The songs contain explicit lyrics, so they should not be played around children. It's mostly not good background music so you won't be able to play it when you have guests, unless they are there for your 16th birthday party. Not many will be able to play this CD in the car and drive without having accidents, LOL, some songs are very hard rock and therefore could be very distracting while driving.That said, some songs are actually good and you'll be able to listen to them with someone who is not into rock, but some of them will make any chillout fan flee. The band does write the texts and plays the music, which is not true of many young bands nowadays. So they deserve 3 stars."
4,this is punk ok?,"this is punk its just an evolved version of the punk we heard being played by the sex pistols,for better or for worse its still punk.fortunatly is for better in this albums case,wondrerfully crafted songs played with verve and fun,not going to change the world but hey who cares really?"
5,Well scrubbed,"The recording engineers did as good a job as can be expected cleaning up this CD. If you have kids and want to be able to listen to this album with them around, buy the clean version -- you won't miss a *(...)thing! Oh, and I like the music."
2,This album is decent but not as good as advertised...,"Not only is this not even the groups best album, it is definitly not as good as all the fuss would lead you to believe. Blink does have their moments on Enema Of the State but they are few and far between. All The Small Things is my favorite track and about the only one I enjoy listening to. A better ""new"" group out there is Lit and their debut album A Place in the Sun, it sounds less like NSync and Backstreet than this album that could best be described as adequate."
5,Blink 182's Enema of the STate:,"I think that this is a great CD. It has a few curse words in it on songs numbers 1+6, but other than that it's great! I listen to it every day! It's my favorite CD. I am only 11, but my mom still let me have it because my dad sent it to me for Christmas. I especially like songs numbers 2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12.I really really like song number 9 because I remembered all the lyrics. I like 1 and 6 too! For those of you who are thinking about buying it, you should! It's a great CD! I like Blink 182 so much that I have a clear binder with Blink on the cover! Bye! Hope you buy the CD because it's awsome!"
2,Not Punk Rock,"If this album had been billed as a pop album, I might have been inclined to give it a higher rating. However, Blink bills themselves as punks, which they are sadly not. All the songs on Dude Ranch (with the possible exception of Adam's Song) are as bubble gum as Britney Spears despite the fact that their authors have tatoos and dyed hair. Rarely is their a song that is more superficial than ""What's my Age Again?"". Maybe blink will eventually be hailed as great pop artists, however, they will never be in the same leauge as Punk bands like The Clash, The Sex Pistols, Social Distortion, or the Ramones. In my opinion, they will always be categorized with other bland, no-message pop artists. A great Punk album ""Dude Ranch"" is not."
2,This is not real punk,"After i bought Blink's chesire cat album, i've been a fan of them, but after this album, i'm not anymore. Blink does not have that punk sound that they used to. Buy this is you like punk-pop, but this isn't for the real punk rocker.........."
5,BLINKING MARVELLOUS!,"I don't normally review music, but I liked this cd so much that I had to. It is very rare that you come across an album without a weak track on it, but that is what Blink 182 have given us with Enema of the State. It's a great album which will have you jumping all over the room, it offers a mixture of tunes, which range from almost melancholy (Adams Song) to out right hyperactive (All the Small Things). The classic Blink humour is still present and as for ""sell outs"" isn't that just a term that seems to be used when a band become successful, by spotty people who only think music is cool if no one else has heard of it?If you like the work of Green Day and Offspring (before they went cheesy)or are just simply a fan of rock then I am certain that you will love this album. BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!"
1,"Of course it sounds like teeny bopper, because it is!","Anyone who even mutters the word ""punk"" in association with Blink 182 needs to have ""punk"" defined. ""Punk"" is Dead Kennedys, Anti-Flag, Black Flag, Crass, The Business, The Descendents, Rancid, Bad Religion, NOFX, AFI, etc. It is being aware of the messed up things happening in the world around you. It is fighting for what you know to be right and fighting against what you know to be wrong. It is resisting racists, homophobes, sexists, Nazis, religious zealots and all intolerant people. It is about helping those that need a hand and not about doing only what helps you. Blink 182 is none of these things. It deserves to be labeled teeny bobber, and to be lumped in with Ricky Martin and The Backstreet Boys. I am happy for you if you like Blink 182, but please don't damage a legitimate movement, the punk movement, by associating Blink 182 with it."
3,Not as good as Buddah or Dood Ranch but OK,"For all those that have purchased one of Blinks Cds in the past may or may not be dissapointed. The songs in this Cd have lost most of their Punk edge, but are still good to listen to. If your a hardcore punk fan, get something from pennywise, mxpx, less than jake, or Living end."
5,"A Great CD With An Even Mix Of Serious, & Joke Songs","This is an AWESOME CD! You can listen to it all the time. It has songs that are just for fun(i.e. Aliens Exist), and then some songs that help you out in some real life issues (i.e. Adam's Song, and Anthem). I think it is a great mix. I don't think it's that much different from 'Dude Ranch'. Blink 182 is THE BEST band right now. And they continue to compose good punk music. NOT pop, or alternative, like some people say. If you haven't already, BUY THIS CD! PS All you people that ""love"" blink 182 because of 'All The Small Things', and 'All The Small Things' only, STOP CALLING YOUR SELF A BLINK 182 FAN!"
5,Fabolous- Blink 182 ROX!,"The best songs on here are Whats My Age Again, All The Small Things, Dont Leave Me, & Adam's Song. Blink 182 have brought a new voice to the sound of punk rock, and I like it!"
3,whattttttt??????,"quote from drew: Note:If you like Fenix TX,Sum 41,MxPx,The Get Up Kids,Ataris, or New Found Glory than you MUST buy this one.Well,at leat give it some consideration. WHAT THE HELL?!? Ok, new blink recruits! you can have fenix tx! you can have sum 41! you can have new found glory! you can even have mxpx if you really want it. just please don't take the ataris or the get up kids. please. those of us who were upset enough at blink's transition to your crowd do NOT need the added stress. oh...and since i need a comment about the music...i'll admit this cd is pretty damn catchy."
2,Definately not Punk,"This is much less of a punk album then it is a power-pop song compilation. Their gutiars aren't that fast, and the lyrics might as well be from a Weird Al boy boy band parody. The truth is, MTV became too tempting to resist for Blink, so they refined their sound, gave it poppy hooks, and the result is a fairly catchy and all too sugary sweet album. Dude Ranch was no masterpiece, but it earned my respect for it's much raunchier humor and Punk guitar jams. They were still punk-pop, but dang good punk-pop, sort of like Green Day on speed. ""Enema"" is obviously targeted at the MTV fanbase, and as a result, they got trendy real fast. That is not punk. Punk is loud, fast, and free-willed. ""Enema"" is loud...and nothing else. If you like their lame lyrics about girls and romantic triangles, the Descendents, who pioneered everything that Blink would be 80s, are much better. They're funny, and they really rock, unlike this lame Boy Band with gutiars."
1,there is much better stuff than this out there,"Although many people seem to think that this album is a developmental step and worthy of its accolades, if you listen to any other smaller poppunk bands you will hear the same sound with superior vocals and better energy. The whole album is overly polished and smoothed to be just homogenous enough for the pop-listening audience it appeals to. Support a local poppunk scene and you will hear much better things. I listen to crustpunk, but, from the days when I enjoyed poppunk, I can suggest Youth Ahead, 5 Cent Deposit, LWL, Lanemeyer, Weston, Plan-A, Ann Beretta, Bigwig, or any number of other bands that haven't sold out and retain a great, infectious sound. To listen to Blink is ordinary and conformist in an extremely unappealing way. Investigate further; this album is not particularly interesting and no poppunk band is worth Blink's ticket prices."
4,Is it punk enough? Who cares!,"Every single time a band goes platinum, everyone starts knocking 'em. Wassup wit dat? Enema is a well-made album, Blink are doing the same thing they were doing 6 years ago, and guess what? They're getting more popular and are even (gasp!) turning new school kids onto Bad Religion!Yeah, so they're not exactly a Dischord band. Why is this so troubling to so many people? I still spend most of my time listening to the Dismemberment Plan or Pavement or Shellac, but I really like what Blink are doing. ""Adam's Song,"" as most people have written, is a great listen -- and the lyrics actually have some depth! The whole CD reminds me of plenty of other great punk bands, just as those other bands remind me of Blink. It's fun, catchy, mindless, meaningful, well-done music. I'd like to see them branch out even more on their next album, but until then, Enema of the State will have to suffice."
1,garbage!,"okay.. lets see what I need... A drummer who has the skill level of a 5th grader...a guitarist who knows what a power chord is (the first chord you learn when u take guitar lessons!)... a desire to sell out! I've got it! ding ding! Lyrics like MY GIRLFRIEND, SHE LEFT ME AND NOW I AM REALLY SAD, NA NA NA. This is trash. EMO at its worst. I wouldn't even call it punk, just MTV poser-mindless trash."
4,good but not best,if you are new and want expert advice listen to me 1 dude ranch..............2 cheshire cat.........3 buddha................... 4 line up...............5 enama of the state
1,Blink sold out,"This album is a prime example of what happens to good bands when they get greedy. They sell-out and change their music style. Enema is completely different from past Blink albums in the way the music is not as raw. It is disappointing. This clearly enters them into the ""pop"" instead of ""punk"" category.Say it ain't so fellas'. I hope the next album has them return to their roots."
1,Why?,"Blink 182 proves that, once again, they have nothing to say. Their lyrics are empty - no meaning, nothing more than some talentless teenagers trying to say stuff that will sound ""cool"" to an audience of teenage boys, trying to get their record to sell. Unfortunately, this method, as proven by others such as Eminem and Kid Rock, always works. Just look at the cover of the CD. Is this a band that relies on its musical talent, or its shock value? In addition to Blink 182's inability to convey any worthwhile method with their words, their music also fails to stray from the norm. Every song sounds exactly the same. Their drummer knows only one rhythm (or at least uses only one) - his incessent 1-2-1-2-1-2. This CD left my asking ""why,"" as in ""why would anyone want to listen to this?"""
1,I guess punk is dead,"I have some of the other reviews for Enema of the State and I have come to a conclusion: either punk is dead or all these younger listeners don't have a clue about punk music. I suspect Lou Pearlman formed this group of poseurs. All the tracks on this album sound hollow and shallow. If anyone reading this review should be interested in punk, please buy the following albums: Black Flag ""Damaged"", Husker Du ""Zen Arcade"", Dead Kennedys ""Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables"" or ""Plastic Surgery Disasters"", Minor Threat ""Complete Anthology"", Misfits ""Static Age"", and Circle Jerks ""Golden Shower of Hits""."
1,you call this punk?,ha! i was tiring of that song all the small things on radio i thought you call this punk? now if you want to hear real punk music why not simply listen to london calling by the clash. not like these so called punk artists who thing they can make up for their lack of talent with childish humour and making their music as loud as possible. where is the rage to be found which defined punk music in the 70s. these guys are only interested in making money. (...) [I]f you think that you are a true punk fan stay away.
3,"Enemy Of The Listener? No, just average...","There are two problems with this album. One, it is edited (I received the edited version, there was nothing that said it was edited when it was bought.) Although they only take out five words, the five words taken out greatly deter from the music when taken out. The second thing is, the album is just over 35 minutes long. The first four songs are average, What's My Age Again? is still good listening, but Dystenery Gary is an improvement. The next two songs are okay, Party Song is slightly above average, and Mutt is great. The next song is okay, but Anthem is both funny and great, especially for head-banging. The album is, overall, very funny, but don't buy it for over thirteen bucks."
5,AWESOME!,This is an awesome CD. It is one of the few albums that I can listen to all the way through without skipping ANY tracks. They definitely hit a home run with this one.
1,This is the album that made them suck,"Blink-182 used to be my favorite band, until this cd came out. This CD is not punk rock, I don't know what it is. Even though all the preps say that they are punk, they are not. They are a bunch of sell-outs. I think that blinks cds are getting worse and so are the lyrics. If you want to listen to some real punk then go listen to Dropkick Murpheys, Rancid, Ataris, Less Than Jake, AFI, Millencolin, or Bad Religion."
1,punk fan from jersey,"This cd just plain [stinks]. I was a fan of Blink 182 for a long time and being a fan of pop punk in general (New Foung Glory, Green Day, Ataris, etc.), I was really pumped for this album. Cheshire Cat was an absolutley amazing pop punk album, probably the best pop punk album ever. Buddah and Dude Ranch were also great albums. So, knowing this and hearing What's My Age Again which was a decent single, I expected some good stuff. Boy was I dissapointed. The album is filled just bad songs that disgrace the name of punk. If Blink wants to make this music they should at least let their new fan base of 13 year old girls know that THIS ISN'T PUNK. It disposable garbage that old fans of Blink shouldn't even consider picking up. Let's just hope that their next album heads back towards their roots"
5,blinkin' with pleasure,"Not bad this time. Even if it's not a pure punk. Who cares in the long run, when the music is so powerful, the lyrics are that smart, and there's a lot of energy and fun on this 12-track cd. That's a definite breakthrough, one of the greatest albums of the recent times.All the Small Things, What's My Age Again and Adam's Song are awesome, the greatest songs on the cd unmistakingly taken to the radio and MTV and heard by now by everyone. You can hardly get tired of listening to them - real diamonds won't get pale.Aliens Exist, Anthem, Don't Leave Me, Mutt and Wendy Clear are another series of so much catchy melodies and powerful rythms.The rest is pretty the same quality music which you may easily like as well.Don't even think of not buying this. You'll regret it for the rest of your life. If you like a good pop music, this cd is just for you. Just click the ""buy"" button."
3,So Much Potential.. So much unnecessary vulgarity...,"I'll keep it simple.. I love Blink 182's style, the album is great, and yet the incessant swearing and vulgar lyrics makes it a bit hard to listen to.I love rock, and this album is a great one.. but I wish they had a clean version...Definately not one for your teens if you're a parent.."
1,KIDDIE BAND!,"the song all the small things is like hearing old kid songs. Dude ranch was so good, and now look at them. this band is allllllllllll over mtv, and it's so annoying to see. This band is for the one year olds."
1,THIS IS NOT PUNK!!!!!!,"This is pop in it's truest form! It's down there with your boy band-britney spears-christina aguilera trash! The sad thing is that their older stuff was actually decent before they became total sellouts with this awful stuff.OK....many people have different opinions about music and I respect that, and if you do like Blink 182 then i will respect your opinion ONLY if you admit that Blink is a huge sellout and NOT PUNK!If you are curious as to what actual punk sounds like check out the Dead Kennedys, Government Issue, Chaos UK, Subhumans, Casualties, and TSOL"
1,MetalPlayerPlaysSolos,"They suck, there not good. There nothing more to say. Wait oh yeah and they get play solos, no more or never did, but they still suck and who ever hates metal can in the words of megadeth can GO THE HELL."
2,Great CD but explicit versions better!!!!,"This is a great cd dont get me wrong but the clean version is horrible. Almost every song your editing words out and it sounds stupid. Do me a favor, if you like the music get the real version!!!"
4,All The Small Things,This cd is great because hot chick on cover and great songs everyone is great great guitar players and awesome rockers have a goood long road trip Blink 182 keep in touch.
5,Only the Best,So what did i think about blink 182's new cd? IT ROCKED! they could not have come better in my opinion and i loved all the songs
5,Blink -182- Very Good Album,"This album is absolutley ace! For all Punk, Indie fans this is a must. Rock fans also love this album. Blink -182- deserve all the success this album will get! This is an must for most music fans."
2,"they are good, but not that good","While I do think that Blink 182 are three very talented individuals,all their songs tend to sound the same. When I went to the POP DISASTER TOUR and they came on stage me and my friend would be like ""hey I like this song..wait a minute...I don't know this one"" and we'd have to wait till they start singing to know which one it was. While i do like ""Adams Song"" and ""All the small things"" I would not recommend the C.D. The are a great radio band but I wouldn't buy the C.D."
3,A decent effort,"Certainly not on the level of Dude Ranch (or Cheshire Cat, for that matter) but the songs are catchy and it's good for driving. If you only know Blink from the radio, you'll probably like this one. If you've been with them from the beginning, you'll probably think it's a little too pop and not enough punk. Blink has always been bubblegum punk, but they may be approaching the point of no return. All-in-all, I'd say it's worth buying used."
5,Blink rules and that hot chick on the cover is..........,BLINK 182 RULES and that hot chick on the cover is the pornstar Janine check them and her out they'll blow you away
2,"I give these guys credit for their success, but.....","....they don't work well enough for me. Except for ""All The Small Things,"" actually a good video, this album is just another one of those examples of how a once-great band sells out like crazy when they release some single aimed at the pop-trash/MTV/radio-play bulls**t America loves so damned much. It's funny how artists like Offspring, Korn, Metallica, and Marilyn Manson have gone from ordinary ""real"" artists to MTV-engineered Pokémon trainers who can't deserve the icing on the cake. Now then, as I was saying, these guys. Okay, so they sold out with this album. So what? That doesn't make this album more special than any of their other releases. This Enema and its predecessor, ""Dude Ranch,"" both earned 4-star ratings from allmusic.com (the AMG). Only DR was the AMG pick of Blink 182, which obviously means that it's slightly better than this. If you still like Blink 182, I'm just going to have to leave it at that."
2,Punk-Pop,"Hey, I have to say that this album is the worse of the Blink 182 guys ! When I bought this record I was very happy but when I put it in the sterio sounds like Britney Spears (not really). Seriusly this guys become pop! If you wanna hear the true punk check out Dude Ranch (It's awsome) or Chesire Cat."
5,This album totally rocks!,"Blink 182 has done an awesome job on this album! Almost every single song is good which is EXTREMELY rare to find nowadays. I am real picky about buying CD's but after listening to tons of callers call in on loveline (when Blink was the guest) and remark on how much they loved the new CD, I was totally motivated. And I am completely satisfied. I have had the CD on repeat ever since I bought it."
4,Just as good as Cheshire Cat....,"They really did work hard on this album (if you listend to it you can tell). It's not really like there old stuff (I still think Cheshire Cat is my fav. though), but the new stuff is really great!! My fav. song on the album has to be either ""Mutt"" or ""Wendy Clear""."
3,"a good cd, but not as good as dude ranch","I really had high hopes for this cd. I have dude ranch and i was hoping this one would be just as good. I was wrong. The songs are too slow and they all seem alike. I really dont see a difference in the drumming, the old drummer is about as good as the old one. My advice is to buy this only if your a true blink 182 fan."
4,This CD rocks!,"Blink-182 has done it again. Dude Ranch ruled, and this CD is just as good. It has the punkish tunes that make you jump around, and yet all the songs have a point. The only reason this album did not get a full five stars is because of how short it is."
2,Poser punk rock,"Some of the songs are great and the songs anthem and mutt alonemake this CD worth buying but it also has plenty of pop ( ) likewhat's my age again, All the small thing and the annoying adam's song which is more like pearl jam's last kiss than i can take. ( ) END"
1,Horrible!,"I really truely dont see how these guys are any different than any of the pop boy bands out their. poor musicianship; making money off their looks; horrible lyrics. you might say ""oh but theyre ""punk"""" thats bs go buy an against all authority or an anti-flag cd for real punk."
5,One of the best!,"This CD is the best blink one yet, it is their first one with parental advisory witch makes it better. First if their was more than 5 stars I would give it 1000000000000+. Second the best tracks are #1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13."
4,Stay away from Carson!,"I like Blink 182 and I like Enema of the State.Not because they're on TRL or because Carson Daly says they're cool. But the band itself has changed so much.But I can't really blame them completely.I say it's that MTV,TRL, and that horrible Carson Daly.It's sad that they've become based on image like many these current ""pop sensations""(which they are always asociated with).They often appear in those girlie teeny bopper magazines,along with BSB,N Sync,etc.Because they're ""cute"". They're even in mags like Disney Adventures (a magazine mostly for kids under 10).What's next?a Blink 182 concert on Nick Jr. Does anyone see how musically different they are? Sure, Enema isn't as hard as Dude Ranch(great album), but does N sync have any of the outrageous lyrics that Blink uses.Hopefully they will realize what they've become,and turn it around.I'm not saying they should't be on MTV. They should stay away from that ""holier than thou"" Carson Daly."
3,they ARE sellouts,"who ever wrote ""shut your mouth if you think they're sellouts"" is so wrong. sellout means ""To attract prospective buyers; be popular on the market"" which is exactly what blink became with this cd. they ARE sellouts. The cd is ok but it is annoyingly repetitive. and i'm pretty sick of hearing ""what's my age again"" and ""all the small things"" their first three cds were so much better than this"
1,punk? yeah right,"The golden rule of punk is, whenever a band shows up on JayLeno you cease to be punk.Don't do the ""just because they aresuccessful doesent mean they are not punk!"", yes it does. to this band.This is very poppy commercial sounding music. The songs have no real message and nobody is pissed! Great production but what else do you expect from a corporate band. The songs have no soul the band has no plans. Go get some Dead Kennedys and re-educate yourself."
1,When punk finally died.,"I don't know why they call this punk. This is pure syrupy power pop with a singer that sounds like a little whiny brat. I wouldn't really think a punk band would win Nickelodeon's best band award, I mean that's just embarrassing. What is worse they are the one's that opened the gate for emo which is the lamest excuse for music ever. The album was just unbearable and I will not go back to it. Turn the lights off, carry me home."
5,#1 BLINK-182 FAN SO SHUT UP POSERS,THE CD IS BEST ONE BY BLINK-182 I THINK YET . IM NOT GOING TO BE COOL LIKE EVERYONE ELSE AND TRY TO COMPARE IT TO THEIR OTHER CD'S BECAUSE THAT IS STUPID ALL YOU PEOPLE THAT JUST STARTED LISTENING TO THEM AND SAYING HOW COOL THEY ARE NEED TO SHUT OF BECAUSE YOU ARE ALL A BUNCH OF WIGGERS AND POSERS .
3,eh...this disk is alright,"I was a Blink fan when they first came out, but they don't have the great style of the old-school blinkstreet i used to know. Cheshire Cat and Dude Ranch were great, but now they are just another pop/punk poser band. the only songs I dig on this are adam's song, and a few other's but adam's song in particular. (which is pretty strange because it's nothing like their old stuff. it's not even their style. it is a great song though.) if you're into the new popular punk scene with the new popular blink 182, buy this disk. if you long for the old stuff, this is not for you. peace out."
1,I Wish I Was Deaf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Remember when punk rock was actually interesting? Before assembly line bands like this one took over? If you want to hear anything remotely original stay away from this ""music""."
4,its really good,Blink 182 is the best and Whats My Age Again is one of the best songs on it as well as Going Away To College buy it now
2,Blink . . . o blink,"Sellin out isnt always cool, but blink did on this album. At first, i defended their butts, but now it shows through. Blink is a great band with wonderful talent. But they didnt have to change their music just to make people like them.Go out and buy Chesire Cat and Dude Ranch. ull see how they changed. Blink is still the best but they need ""time to sow all the bridges that they burned"""
4,Good job.,"I'll Rrank Blink like this- Dude Ranch, Enema of the State, Buddha (I' dob't have CC). If you havn't noticed, their music is getting more and melodic. Persoanlly I think Enema is a little too laid back and mellow, but that's still okay."
2,Can we say....Trash?,"I'm going to try not to completely dis this CD. I gave it two stars because I really enjoyed Adam's Song...but...that was it. Like my title says, this CD was absolute trash. The lyrics are awful, guitar amazingly easy and bad,and most of the chorus' are boring. All this band is trying to do is please the majority of people out there, which I'm not happy to admit like pop.This band needs to try harder."
5,Great CD not bad at all,"This cd is awesome! it has everything you would want in a punk cd and pop cd. Best songs- all the small things, don't leave me PS even though this cd has a parental sticker its not that bad except for mutt which uses F*** the wrong way"
2,what happened to blink-182?!,This cd was alright but all the songs sounded the same. If you want to here a really good cd by Blink-182 buy Cheshire Cat. I don't know what happened to Blink-182 they used to kick but now..... I don't know...... they don't sound as good
5,very good,"This Cd kicks. Not only is whats my age again good but so is aliens do exist. I would by it if you like Lit,Smash mouth and citizen king."
3,Good...but they're selling out,"There are some good songs on this new album by my home band, but I think they tried to change a little TOO much. They should stick with they're old energetic music from Dude Ranch. Disappointing."
3,Blink at its worst,"unfortunately, this is the worst blink 182 cd i have ever heard. but the songs still seem to amaze me, so i give it a three."
5,great cd,"blink 182 has been my favorite band since i first heardthem. they explain life in my point of veiw and how akward it can begrowing up cuz basically, im growing up with them. the whole cd is listenable but why stick such a depressing song near the beginning? cheshire is the most punk by far. and even though mark gets the hits, tom gives the band punki flavor with his voice."
1,Teen-ager's garage rock.,The rythms to all the songs are the same. The guitar is too blasty. These are the kind of songs I expect to be used in certain movie scenes. Will never buy such a cd.
5,Everybody has to buy this CD!,"This is a very well-done, awesome CD! It is not quite as ""punk rock"" as their previous release ""Dude Ranch,"" but it is still very awesome. The best tracks are ""Dumpweed,"" ""Aliens Exist,"" ""Going Away to College,"" and ""What's My Age Again?"" I urge everyone who enjoys punk rock to buy this CD. If you don't like punk rock, buy it anyway for a wake-up call. You won't regret it."
2,The rise and fall of Blink.,"Enema of the State by Blink 182 made this pop/punk band a household name. In some ways, this album made them a little too popular and the music suffered after that. Adam's Song, All the Small Things, What's My Age Again?, and Wendy Clear are still pretty decent songs but the rest is just garbage. It's sad to hear about drummer Travis Barker, hope he has a speedy recovery but this cd is not in anyways memorable."
5,A must have,"This album is a must for any music fan, whatever music you are into. I had not heard much about them until I heard what's my age again and I straight away came on amazon to check out the reviews and they were all good, so i decided to buy and have not stopped listening to it since. The best song is Adam's song, but also- don't leave me, all the small things and wendy clear are brilliant songs too. This album is a must have! YOU WON'T BE DISAPOINTED."
5,AWESOME CD,"dumpweed:9/10-great opening song!!!! good vocals by tomdont leave me:8/10: good song,good guitaraliens exist:9/10 good song, funny lyrics, this song was for tomgoing away to college:8/10 2nd seroius song on the albulmwhats my age again:15/10:funny lyrics, great guitaring, good lyricsdysentery gary:7/10 ok song imature song alsoadams song:20/10: serious song,good voclas, only song where they are not imature GREAT SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!all the small things:16/10 good song no reason not to like itthe party song:9/10 good song funny lyrics fast pacedmutt 7/10 ok songwendy clear: same as muttanthem 10/10: good song funny lyrics, GREAT DRUMMING!!!!!!!!!!!!BUY THIS CD"
5,If You Don't Own This- you need to,"Just get this cd...it has such classics as ""What's My Age Again?"", ""All the Small Things,"" and ""Adam's Song.""Some people criticize blink for ""All the Small Things"" being too ""poppy""- but it was a song for his girlfriend- take it for what it is- a fast, fun, enjoyable song.Pretty much unknown tracks such as ""Dysentery Gary,"" ""Wendy Clear"", and ""Going Away to College"" are superb songs totally deserving of your ears.You shan't be disappointed...go buy this classic."
5,cool,"simply AWESOME I cannot wait until the release geez I love so many of the songs on here but ""whats my age again?"" stands out I love it!"
3,look at all these reviews. blinks gonna get popular,"When i went to a concert for unwritten law about three years ago, i heard this phenomenal band called blink-182. A couple days later i wore a blink shirt to school, and everybody asked me what blink 182 was. Now i can't help but notice that blink 182 has lost its punk rock edge and is becomming this trendy popular alternative pop. this sucks. I wish blink stayed punk. If you wanna good blink CD, go buy budha, don't waste your time on this sellout CD"
4,It's good,"Okay...there is a sticker that says ""Explicit Lyrics"" but they really aren't THAT bad. ""Dysentery Gary"" has the majority of the curses...the ""f"" word shows up more than 3 times, but if you ask me, any teenager can hear that in school anyway. Compared to other CDs that have been stickered, ""Enema of the State"" is mild. The songs rule...""Adam's Song"" is the best, I think."
2,"Blink 182's ""Enema of the State"" is rather dissapointing.","The newest album by Blink 182 is one of the worst punk albums I have ever listened to. It is your typical punk album and there really is no difference in the songs. The strongest songs on the album are their hit singles, ""What's My Age Again"" and ""All the Small Things."" Enema of the State is just a collection of power chords and high-pitched, juvenile lyrics that drown out after five minutes."
3,You can blink for this CD!,I just recently got this CD. I am a pre-teen girl and this cd rocks. The inside cover has some humor. I only knew 2 songs but after lisiting to this cd i knew them all. I don't think they should have all the swears in it but I didn't mind it. If you have any questions please e-mail me.
3,"Great rock mixed with punk style, too short.","Blink's childish antics are back. Most of the songs are good. The standouts are ""What's My Age Again""(of course), ""Dumpweed"", ""Adam's Song"" (for some unknown reason, and (I don't know if everyone will agree with me)""the Party Song. The CD is way to short, only about half an hour. The guitar on this CD is great and more complicated then Lit's "" A Place in the Sun"" but I think Lit makes the guitar sound better."
5,The Best,"Enema of the State is a great CD. Almost all of the songs are fast pase, except Adam's Song. If you've ever listened to Buddha, you can tell how much their music has changed. This CD has a bit more swearing than the other CD's, but WHO CARES? So I suggest that you should buy this CD as soon as you can, you won't be let down."
4,total punk cd,"This cd is great for all blink fans i got it 2 years ago and still listen to it all the time. All te songs have great points and either funny,sad,happy, or just plain good lyrics. If ur a huge blink fan then u probobly already have this cd but if u like punk/alternative rock you'll love this cd buy enema of the state! The only reason it got 4 stars instead of five is cause their newer cds are even better so buy all of 'em!!!! ope my review is helpful. cya"
5,This is really great...,"I have to admit that I haven't been a true obsessive Blink fan forever or anything, but I think they're great....Also, I agree that the explicit version is better than the edited one. It takes away from the song if you don't hear all of it.""The Party Song"" is one of my favz...and ""Aliens Exist"" is really great. If your like me and love to memorize song lyrics, you need this CD... The songs are so.... well...unusual. And all the other songs are really great. I wish the CD wuz longer, but it's kool...These guyz have a great sound... And I really hope that these guyz won't turn out to be a ""fad"" or a ""trend"".... KEEP THE BLINK PRIDE ALIVE!"
3,Wow,"I couldn't tell whether i liked this cd or not. It has some great catchy tunes and then some songs that just bang and bang and bang you on. Then you have those songs that are just ok. it's a pretty good cd i guess for punk rock fans, but Blink 182 is in a league of their own. I strongly dis-reccomend this for kids under 11 because of the lyrics. It does hold some good tunes and hits but overall a ok cd."
5,A redefining genre type of cd,"With their 3rd major release, Blink-182 redefined the pop-punk genre that had been dominated by the Descendents, MxPx, etc. Every song on this album has a certain catch or hook to it. There is not a dull moment on this album, and I have listened to it more than any other album I own. I consider myself an avid listener of music, as I have over 4000 songs now on my iPod ranging from death metal to reggae to classical, but no other cd over the years has quite caught my attention as this one has. By far the defining album of Blink's carrer as well as a defining pop-punk album to close the 90s. A true classic, highly recommended."
3,Average Immaturity,"I havent got the most recent CD of blink but i hope to god they act like adults. their being immature isn't a bad thing neccesarilly because they express it in song ""What's My Age Again?"" It's a sort of annoying half-wit CD but it's got its good and great blink classics.2 best songs: What's my Age Again & Don't Leave Me2 Worst Songs: wendy Clear & anthem"
1,Oh boy.,"Well, a friend of mine left this CD at my house and I was amazed at the lack of musical skill these guys have. In my mind, a horrible band. They seem like great and pretty funny guys but I didn't see any compensation in it for the music. Just my opinion. Call me an overanalytic music freak, but its void of any real well-thought out compositions. If they were my friends in high school, I'd support them, but now that they make lots of money, they've gotten all the money they need, don't buy it."
5,wtf?,What the hell is wrong with you ppl? this album is definatley one of the greatest albums of the 90's!!how can you say that Nevermind is one of the greatest albums ever when you just crap all over Enema? nirvana was just as mainstream as blink 182 is if not more! this cd has really great songs and the drums are great. tom and mark do rad jobs on the guitar and bass and vocals! this is a great cd..so stop bad mouthing it. you guys rock luv ya 4ever!
2,the only ok thing they've done,"I bought this album one year after it's original release, i didn't liked it (except for Adam's song, which is on my opinion a graet song ), if you liked previous blink stuff you'll like this, is basiclly the same sound and the same vibe. But we can not expect a lot from a band of guys that are extremly inmature, and always repeating the same thing, still i think it's blink's best album (the rest are really bad, they are always trying to sound like higher level bands like green day) if you are a blink fan, and haven't got it yet, get it , you'll have a good time listening to it"
3,Punk?,"My friend seems to think that Blink-182 is not punk. If you think that they are punk, please click on the ""Yes"" button below. If you believe that this album does not reflect punk, click on the ""No"" button below. The question, obviously, is: Is Blink-182 a punk band?"
1,Never recieved the product,I never recieved the product but I am still charged for the cd. Please contact me asap so we may work something out.
5,blink's best cd out,"I'd recommend thid cd to everyone who is a fan of blink182.I have all of the blink182 cd's and this one is with no doubt the best.At first you will only like a couple songs, but as you listen to it more and more you will get hooked to songs like, all the small things,what's my age again,going away to college,adams song and aliens exist.I like all of the songs and I think if you buy this cd you will think the same too."
2,The worst cd by Blink!!!!!,"I really do not think this cd is worth spending 15+ dollars for, go out and buy Dude Ranch, or Chesire Cat, or even TOYPAJ. This cd really disappointed me for the follow up to Dude Ranch. There is an exception with some good songs like Dumpweed, Anthem, and Aliens Exist, and thats about it. If you wanna know a cd to spend ur [money] on it is Box Car Racer!!!"
3,Were Doing Great Until Enema...,"Blink was doing great until Enema. They had hits but were still their same original punk rock. ""Dammit"", ""Josie"", ""M&M's"". Those were great songs that were on the radio and were giving them success, why did they have to come out with this stuff. To me, it's just not Blink. It doesn't have the energy of Dude Ranch or Cheshire Cat. Maybe just cause I've listened to Blink since the days those CD's came out. I don't know, I just can't get into Enema. I don't get why Blink just didn't stick with their originality. I think they would have done just as good, but still had the respect of the true Blink punk fans. I also just listened to Take Off Your Pants... and they're heading towards the right track, but there are still some poppy songs, but definitely a lot better than Enema, but not the same as Dude Ranch or Cheshire, don't think anything will compare."
5,WHAT THE FRICK?,"Why is it that no punk/ska bands can make it big? What does it matter if everyone knows who they are? It doesnt mean they still dont make great music. Sure there have been people who have been with blink from the beginning, but now those people fear that they wont be the only ones who know of them. How about everyone just listen to whatever they want, and not worry about who is selling out or making it big?"
1,Absolute Oppostie of What Punk is About,"I feel that punk is about not selling out. Blink-182 missed the target by a lot with this CD. The lyrics and videos appeal to teenybopper teenage girls, and their attempt at being 'funny' and 'cute' is horribly nauseating. One of the lead singer's voice is horribley screechy and hard to stomach. Punk-rockers: Stay away from this CD. Teenybopper Girls: I think you'll like it. Bottom line: Not punk, annoying lead singer, no talent, 'punks' trying to be 'cute' and 'funny'. Now ask yourself: Is it really worth it? Do I want to be another sheep? No, you sure as hell don't. stay away from his disk..."
5,Blink Me,"Well for this cd i think they should have a larger range to rate it, 5 stars just doesnt quite do it for Enema of the State. 100 stars sounds a little better. there is no way to describe it except to hear the brilliant music contained on this compact disc. Blink 182 is by far the greatest band to ever set foot on this planet we call earth and this is they best album. So i cant understand why anybody would be above paying the $12.00 for this cd. Please, if you have not bought this yet, do it. it will make your life so much better."
3,Purty Fricken Okay,"This recording's okay, I bought it for ""What's My Age Again?"" and ended up listening to Going Away to College, Small Things, the Party Song, and Anthem. That's about all. Some of the songs are a little...honest, but TOM DELONGE IS SOOOO HOT! You should see the inside of the CD cover..."
5,Never seen a better..,"Blink 182 mixed alternative with rock with punk in such a way that I had to buy this c.d. I love it! I would also like to congragulate Mark with the pregnant dog and Travis with the pregnant model. You guys, this c.d. is the best!"
4,A lot of very cool stuff,"blinks really done a good job on this one. theres a little bit of annoying stuff, like that dysentary gary song that kinda gets on yer nerves, but whats my age again will cure that easily. you can listen to the cd once and instantly love all the songs, thats cool too. aliens exist, whats my age again and the party song are my favorites, especially the party song. its got great lyrics and sounds so cool too."
3,Bunch of losers jumpin on the Bandwagon,"Man i really dislike those MTV jerks...just a bunch of ""Blink fans"" jumpin on the bandwagon. They'll like anything if it's on MTV's Trl or whatever. i hate to admit it but most of the ppl who bought Enema of the States 3 million copies are these people. They aren't true punk fans like some of us. I just hope that Blink exposes who these losers are somehow. If anyone has loved and supported Blink since Buddha or Cheshire Cat and even Dude Ranch you'll know what i mean...Oh yea, as for the cd, well it's a pretty good cd. it's slowed down a bit though thats why it's not my favorite but i still reccomend you buy it."
3,Where did they go?,this CD is different from their old ones but it's stil good. Personally i think dude ranch was their best but they do show signs of good punk then tone down again. I would still reccommend you buy this cd even though it's not hardcore!
1,Poor Quality,"Had following 4 problems with the product- Did not fit a Graco stroller- Features were very rudimentary. It did not even have a zip on the edges to put baby in and out of the stroller. Only way to take the baby out is to take off the cover completely, fold it and keep it aside. Imagine doing that frequently on a shopping trip- It had a depressing yellow tinge. Cannot imagine my baby watching surroundings in that depressing color tinge- Material was of very poor quality. Every time you fold it, the line would stay permanent. It would become crumbled very easily and have very poor visibility after that.We returned this one and got the Jeep Premium one instead and are very happy with the product. It has everything that was lacking in this product plus a lot more. With just $7 more, it is definitely a better value for your money."
4,Does the job,"I bought this product to cover my son's Britax stroller, since the other Britax rain cover was too expensive. This was priced fine so I wanted to buy and thought it will work just fine. And this rain cover works fine, covers the stroller sufficiently. It has straps to make sure it doesn't get blown way in the wind, one thing I have noticed is that the item is not clear plastic but has a bit a brown tint to it."
4,Excellent product,"You get exactly what they advertise, for a great price. Very practical. Baby stays dry and warm!!I absolutely recommend it."
5,Little Kim's Best Ever - Superb.,Suberb quality - Thank you Little Kim.Dont let that Prison Get you Down.They hate to see a Real Nga Free.Eyemurder Entertainment
4,A Matured Rapper!!!,"I absolutel love Lil' Kim and feel the same about this album. Hence, I don't care for the interludes by the male drag queen or whoever he is. I don't think it was needed and I find it quite dated a'la Rupaul's ""Supermodel of the World"" album. Another downside...that horrible song with Snoop Dog. What in the world was Kim thinking? No-one-in-this-day-and-time needs to be writing a song with Snoop about the ""Chronic."" In any case, I feel this is probably her third best album. I rate them in the following particular order:First - HardcoreSecond - Notorious K.I.M.Third - The Naked TruthFourth - LaBella MafiaSo...there you have it."
5,LIL KIM PROVES TO BE THE BEST STILL....,"""THA SOURCE"" MAGAZINE DIDNT GIVE THIS CD 5 MICS FOR NOTHING! THIS CD BY LIL KIM IS THA SH**, FROM HER MUCH ANTICIPACTED SINGLE ""LIGHTERS UP"" WHICH I THINK WILL TURN INTO ONE OF BROOKLYN'S ANTHEMS...TO THA SONG KRONIK WHERE SHE TALKS ABOUT HOW GOOD HER ""SHOT"" IS...LIL KIM IN MY OPINION IS THE BEST FEMALE RAPPER OF MY HIP HOP TIME....IM ONLY 19 BUT IM IN LOVE WITH HIP HOP AND ALSO RAP MUSIC..AND WHEN I BUY CDS I LISTEN TO THE WHOLE ALBUM...AND ANALYZE THEM...NAKED TRUTH BY LIL KIM IS WORTH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY U PAY FOR IT... IT WAS DEFINATELY WORTH THE WAIT...OH YEA.. FREE LIL KIM!!!!!!!!!!"
5,hawwwt,She is so real and she spit bars don't understand how they didn't cred this album cuz she did good on all the songs....#teamlilkim all the way
2,Kim's best effort is still pretty much crap,"It amazes me that she still has a career in music, she was never that talented, she just had her looks going for her, she looks pretty worn out these days with all the plastic surgery and her mic skills leave a lot to be desired. For all of you female hip-hop fans you seriously need to get into Jean Grae, she's the best thing you got going right now."
2,WTF is wrong with you people,"This is the worst rap/hip hop cd of the year so far. She didn't do anything but use the same old beats that everyone else uses and even bit Eminem, check out ""Quiet"" OMFG. I will admit that her lyrics are pretty good which is the only reason it got a 2 but she should have tried to be at least a little original. And I almost forgot, 13 minutes of this cd isn't even music it's just a bunch of talking and that fake pimp trying to be funny."
4,Lil' Kim Out Does Herself,"Lil' Kim has just released the best album since her debut album. I can actually listen to the whole album without skipping a track. Her lyrics are hot and candid, as she speaks of her trial, her sentence, and Junior Mafia. People really need to buy this album and support her, because this album is almost a classic."
1,Just One Question...,..is that suppose to be her (Lil Kim) on the cover of the album? If so that's the fakest picture I've ever seen.
1,shut up kim,"kim's best cd was her first one after that she sucked ever since she did a reality show went to jail and strill this wack piece of trash did'nt sell you ain't pac you little tramp when biggie died everything associated with him died too look at junior mafia I hope kiM never makes aNOTHER CD KIM please quit rapping and take crackhead foxy,with you."
3,Wasn't Worth No 5 Mics But Still Good!!,1. Intro n/n2. Spell Check 4.5/5 good beat!!3. Lighters Up 2/5 first single not a good pick4. Shut Up Bitch (Intro) n/n5.

5,Hot!!!,I was neutral about Lil' Kim before but after hearing this cd I have more respect for her than ever before! Everybody who ever had anything nasty to say in the tabloids or with the trial about her has been put on blast! Watch it! You might get burned.
5,The Greatest CD She Has Made,"I personally have always been a fan of Lil Kim's work. However, she has released albums I was not satisfied with. This CD though is the best she has ever done. It out does Hardcore. Lyrically she is showing some strength. Maybe because now she has something to really talk about all of her songs make sense. I don't feel like I am bouncing around in one song saying ""what is she talking about."" Honestly I love her personality though, she is my favorite but it doesn't mean I will nto be honest.Everyone out there who is doubting this album, all u have to do is listen to a couple of samples. You will want to buy this it is well worth it. It is a really hot album Big ups to kim"
1,Trash,"""Lil Kim don't f*ck around wit REAL G'z, quick to snatch Yo ugly ass off the streets!"" - If you don't know where that quote is from, then you're too young for me and I'm not addressing you. But man if there was ever a definition for WASHED UP, Lord knows, Lil Kim fits the bill. She needs to just ride off into the sunset and quit embarassing herself. The horrendous photo on the cover should serve as warning that it doesn't get much better once you open the album up. Many surgeries removed, she's lost her looks and her brash lyrical style. If Tupac were alive, he'd have a field day clownin her. Anyways, I recommend Trina's ""Glamorest Life"". This right here though, is garbage."
5,They don't call her the QUEEN for nothin!,"I just want to say that this is Kim's HOTTEST album to date. She holds nothin back and even sticks it to your man 5-0... lol!My favorite tracks *all of them are off the hook* would have to be ""Lighters Up"", ""Spell Check"", ""Kitty Box"", ""Quiet"", ""My N****s.If you have any interest at all in Rap/Hip-Hop, do yourself a favor and definitely pick this up. The Queen Bee won't disappoint. :)"
2,No Way In Hell Is This 5-mics!!!,This album has a couple of good songs in particular cause Kim gets personal about alot of the things she's going through but a 5mic rating would mean that the production and album is timeless and this by no means is even near a 4mic album. The super synthy beats sound like any typical mainstream beat and none of them are amazing at all.Only reason i give it 2 stars is because Kim did step up her lyrical game a bit but the whole album isn't real cohesive to say the least.
5,Kim's Best Ever...,"I if you don't have this cd you should go get it right now, this cd has great beats and by the way Lil Kim gets out of jail today. Overall I love the cd and it is a must have for everybody...if you want to know all about what happened before she went to prison and why she went to prison Lil Kim talks about it in the cd. Lil Kim tells it all in her latest cd The Naked Truth. Once again go get it!!!"
5,ITS LIL KIM TIME TO SHINE,SHE IS THE BEST FEMALE RAPPER ON THE MIC! THIS ALBUM REALLY SHOWS HER GROWTH! ALL YOU HATERS I KNOW YOU SEE HER NOW LOL! SHE WILL BE BACK SOON FOR THE TOUR AND WITH GOOD BEHAVOR SHE WILL BE OUT SOONER THAN YOU THINK! ENJOY HER ALBUM WHAT DO I HAVE TO SPELL IT OUT LOL!
3,Must Dig to Find Errors,"While using this to study vector and tensor calculus, I worked through the concepts being presented and also found a number of errors. Wasn't sure if that was a good thing (that I was understanding the material and was able, therefore, to find the errors) or a bad thing (that they were there in the first place). I give it a ranking of 3 because it presents the concepts well (well enough for the student to find the mistakes). But, it should not be the only text a student uses."
2,"Good coverage of concepts, but full of errors.","All of the basic concepts of introductory Tensor Analysis were adequately dealt with in a relatively clear and concise way; however, the numerous errors, oversimplifications, and oversights was a constant source of annoyance and doubt."
1,Keep away from this garbage!,"This book convinced me never to touch anything published by Sybex again. The subject for about a third of the actual questions of the test were not covered in the book at all. The included training software is pathetic, superficial and shallow, the Edge Tests are unusable. I put them down after finding the fifth mistake in the first thirty questions. If you want to pass the exam, find a better book!"
4,Good enough to pass the test!,"I read this book twice, did all the exercises and I passed the test with a 823/1000. The authors made an outstanding job explaining the trust relations, how local & global groups interact with each other and how to manage permissions for users on different domains. However, the authors need to work more on the performance & network monitoring chapters."
2,Inadequate and poorly-written,"Definitely the worst of the the four Sybex core exam study guides. While the critical concepts are all covered, they are not covered in enough depth to prepare you for the kinds of complex scenarios you will encounter on the exam. Too much of the book is repetition of material from the other 2 NT study guides, and too many sections are simply listings of program options without an explanation of their usage. Perhaps the 2nd edition improves on some of these areas."
1,Waste of Money,"I found this book a total waste of money. Exam Cram(s) were better written and contained more information. It has a bunch of practice questions, but after a couple of chapters I put the book back on the shelf. I think now I'll trash it."
2,TOO MANY ERRORS-close by is still a miss,Too many errors. I can't believe Sybex published this. Peter Barbera
4,"Good, but not perfect...","Overall, this book is pretty doggone good. It did have a lot of typos, especially in the answer keys for the chapters. My guess is that the book was rushed to print... I used this book by itself and passed the exam with an 864. A little bit more info on the Network Monitor tool (in particular, setting up the filters) would've been nice. WARNING: If you already own the NT Server book by Sybex, some of the chapters in the Enterprise book are verbatim from that book. (What a ripoff...)"
4,"Clearly written, potentially a good book - too many errors","I read this book in preparation for my exam and scored 842. I liked the style of the book which was not dry like many of the Microsoft texts are. However, I got the impression that the authors and/or publishers were in too big a hurry to get it out on the market and spent too little time proofreading it. There were many errors ranging from simple typos to huge errors that gave completely wrong information. I think I did well on the test from reading this book because I was forced to go to other sources to look up the correct information. Studying this book with a grain of salt, and much questioning, should help an MCSE wannabe score OK on the test. Don't assume that because it is in the book, it is right."
5,Be careful reading the bad reviews,"I really enjoyed this book. When I passed the adaptive exam I KNOW I got 14 of the 15 questions right and think I probably got the other, one, too. About overlap in the series, well, the microsoft core exams have a lot of overlap. It's not the authors fault. About errors, the microsoft way is not always right. You have to learn a few 'wrong' ways to pass their exams. But, yes, the cybex books do explain a few (I've found two) things in ways that will lead you to answer a question or two wrong. Something about manditory profiles being cached locally and upgrading from 95 to NT (you can email me if your concered and need the 'right way'). Otherwise, these books are great. My employer thinks I superman since I've passed four exams in two months."
3,Covers Half the Material,"This study guide covers a good half of the material on the exam.There are a few errors, and you can find better sample tests on the internet than the ones on the CD ROM.Questions at the end of the chapter are a bit too easy... compared to questions on the actual exam.I passed the exam by not only studying this book but also TWO other study guides.I would consider this book an essential study guide for this exam. The problem is that for this exam it seems no one study guide hits the mark with an A+, so you may want to buy several."
3,Beware of this book's coverage of roaming profiles,"I generally found this book to be informative and accurate. There are a lot of repetition from companion Sybex MCSE books, though. The book's coverage of user roaming profiles, though, is completely wrong. Please pay attention to this."
2,Don't judge the other Sybex MCSE books by this one!,"I've just passed this fourth exam of MCSE and I'm really glad I left a few days before taking it, to go through other tests from other vendors and the MS Readiness Review book. It was then that I discovered that this book covers about HALF the detail you need to know! This was quite a surprise - the Sybex NT Server 4, Workstation 4 and Net Essentials books have been excellent. This book overlaps far too much info with the NT Server 4 book, about 70% I reckon, whereas the test overlaps about 10%. In summary, an excellent book if you haven't read NT Server 4, and you don't need to pass the exam for which it was intended to be a study guide."
2,The worst of the Four Core Sybex Guides,"This book is a waste of money. It just repeats information from the NT Server / Workstation Guides by Sybex - which I felt were well done and helped me to pass the exams. It's poorly written, unstructured and does not cover the important 'Enterprise' components for this MCSE certification in any great depth. I'll be using my Osborne guide / New Riders Fast Track for my 4th MCSE exam."
1,Inadequate and poorly-written,The book lacked important details. When I finished I could identify most of the products but had no in-depth knowledge of any of them. Repeats everything from Server and Workstation (again) and leaves out a lot of the Enterprise stuff. Something as expensive as this should cover the subjects in much more detail.
3,Good book but too many errors,"There are so many errors in this book that really scare me. If you are a experienced Network Administrator, you should have no trouble to capture these errors. However, if you are new in this field, be careful. The wrong information provided from this book may cause you big troubles. I rate the book five because I need to call Microsoft supports so many times to make sure I am right. Truthly speaking, the author should re-read the book and correct all errors. After all, the book should be treated like a tool book instead of just a book for passing the test"
5,The Top of his Game!,"This CD has some of the best Lou Rawls Songs on it. How could you not like the unforgettable: You'll never find. This selection is one of Lou's finest. Then He makes you feel good with the selections Groovy People, From Now on & This song will last forever.The Selection Time is very sobering and leaves a message about life itself. Lou's voice really sounds great on this collection. You will enjoy the songs again and again. JayelpriceBeltsville Md."
5,When lou was on his way back !,"Lou Rawls need i say more.This album came out in the summer of 1976.This was and still is one of those rare albums you can play and enjoy the whole thing.For those of you who can get pass groovy people and you,ll never find.Will fine that need you forever,time,and from now on are truly the best cuts enjoy!"
2,BORING,I love Lou Rawls but not this CD.He spend too much time talking and not enough singing.All of the chatter was very annoying.
5,Irish lilt,"If the character in Chapter One, ""Use of Reason"", daunts the squeamish, the rest of the book exercises moderation to the sensibility of the reader. The personality of the character runs from the extremes of tenderness to ice. The title ""Mothers and Sons"" of the book alludes to themes in the stories. I enjoyed the lilt of Gerard Doyle, who dramatized the scenarios."
3,Mothers & Sons - ok reading...,This book came highly recommended. I thought it was an OK read - nothing spectacular.
3,Marred by a black marker,The book arrived on time and in good condition.One bad note is the fact that there's a black marker marring the edges of the cover of the book..
1,much smaller than Sam's Club,"I was really very disappointed that they seemed to be so much smaller than what the money would buy me elsewhere. I thought I would get comparable merchandise. I was very disappointed, and she assumed I spent less than I really did, so it was a big hassle for me all around."
5,GREAT READ,IT'S A GREAT READ ABOUT A GREAT MAN . HIS FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS OF THE WAR REALLY TELL OF A DIFFERENT TIME IN THIS COUNTRY . HE WAS A BETTER MAN THAN ME .
3,Having little trouble getting through it.,Purchased this book for my husband. He reports that he is struggling to get through it. I will report more when I get specifics from him.
2,No more Chamberlain!,"When will people realize how overrated Chamberlain really is? The book does a fair job of describing a moderately interesting man, but his place is the Civil War is consistantly over-emphasized. Just once I'd like to see a little attention paid to someone important like Meade."
5,A great book about a fascinating American hero.,"This is one of those rare books that you find hard to put down once you open the cover! Trulock's attention to detail, and her liberal use of Chamberlain quotes, brings this book alive and draws you into the action and into the mind of this poetic, intelligent, citizen soldier. I'm amazed that this fascinating man was almost lost to history, but thanks to authors like Alice Rains Trulock he is regaining his rightful place in American history."
5,Inexpensive,"I bought this for my 42 yr. old son as a gag gift for Christmas. When he was little I had to read this book to him almost EVERY night for a year or two. He loved this book--if I tried to hurry through it and skip a part--he'd let me know! It's not Christmas yet so I haven't given it to him--but for a few bucks this will bring back memories for him, I'm sure."
3,OK Book.,"If your first grader wants new books to read on his own, this might work. Words are easy to read and print is big enough too."
3,Havoc in Honolulu Vol. 2,"There's muay thai fights on this collection, but there's only 3 of them. It was okay. Get it used!"
5,An Italilian Bossa Nova,"When I first heard this CD in a lovely bookstore in San Francisco, I thought for sure it must be a Latin artist, but it turned out to be the latest album from Concato. The store was having a hard time keeping it in stock because once a person has heard this rich sound you just have to have it in your collection! It is a soulful rendering of many beautiful sounds blended with wonderful lyrics. There is a great feel of romance and lightheartedness all at once...some songs will move you to tears and others will have you grinning, like Tinti. Overall, there is a sense that one is listening to a Bossa Nova album and that adds to the depth of the music. I played this CD as I drove down the coast of northern CA and it moved me beyond words. I hope that you too will enjoy Cancato and this splendid CD as much as I do! It certainly will leave you touched in your soul!"
3,Maintenance,"We bought one of these for my grandsons and they loved it. Only problem was it didn't have a reverse. It is a very well built, heavy little machine but once it breaks...good luck finding somebody that can fix it. Charging wasn't the problem. I ordered new batteries and a new charger. It wouldn't move so we figured it was a gear issue or something but couldn't find anybody within 150 miles that could/would check it out, let alone work on it. Couldn't get any contact with the company either to try to find somebody. Finally, after sitting for almost a year, I just gave it away. What a waste of $$. Same issue with the Razor pocket bike we bought for him. We're now looking a real, fuel-driven, quad or bike for him."
5,Great Buy,"Santa got this for my 6 yr old daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. I received it within a week of ordering it and it was so easy to but together, basically just put the handle bars on, how difficult could that be? It is sturdy and goes faster than I thought it would. I am very pleased and have recommended it to others."
4,Good Vehicle,"I bought this vehicle as a Christmas present for my 5 year old daughter and she loves it. This replaced the 2 year old Barbie Jeep. The original batteries would not hold a charge for more than five minutes, but I knew that might be a problem from my research when I purchased the 4 wheeler. I called Razor and they sent me 2 new batteries under warrenty. After I changed the batteries, it worked just fine. Her first ride lasted 45 minutes. She got tired before the batteries did. I would recomend this product for anyone with an adventurous 5 or 6 year old. The size and speed are perfect."
3,Great except for battery,"This thing is very well built and unlike our older Powerwheels, easily handles grass and hills. BUT, I got a defective battery at first (was replaced my Razor) and since that time I have had to replace the battery again because the replacement gradually lost the abililty to hold a charge. Cold weather kills the battery, so you can not store it in the garage during winter (we live in MA) and taking the battery out is a pain. If the battery issues were resolved, it would be a 5."
2,Charging System is of Low Quality,"The Dirt Quad has proven to be a fun ride for my grandchildren when the Dirt Quad has been operational. I bought the Dirt Quad two Christmases ago and have gone through two chargers, a set of batteries, and am now having to buy a third charger. The chargers appear to last less than a year and, as such, require replacement for Dirt Quad charging and Dirt Quad use. I requested third party vendor information from Razor so a better charging system could be acquired. Razor technicians suggested the charger had to be acquired from the Razor corporation. The low quality of the charger makes the joy that could be capable from the Dirt Quad tend to diminish significantly. Although the Dirt Quad unit appears to be a quality ride, the charging system makes the system as a whole a very poor quality choice."
2,Not Fast at all.,The product is not worth the money. My son has the scooter as well and it will out run the four wheeler. I would not buy this product again.
5,Best ride on Electric,"We bought 2 for our 5 & 7 yr old GIRLS! They absolutely love them; it snowed every week all winter so they learned to ride in the slick snow.....which was a lot more fun then the gravel that made them tipsy. The 7 yr old rides it up on 2 wheels all the time and jumps with it. We always keep them in during the cold to protect the batteries. They actually go alot faster and last 2-3 hours just fine. Now the one is broke down because they washed it and got something wet....Santa will be fixing it for under the tree! We are looking at the Razor dirt bike maybe for the older girl. I think they have learned alot about handling, & driving by playing with them. I can also ride it around the house and to the barn. I highly recomend if you have a large area outside....they will need it!"
4,Razor Dirt bike,"My son really enjoys it. The only bad part is it does not go in reverse. The speed is fast enough for him, but still very safe. I recommend it for younger children."
1,Battery is Horrific- Don't buy!!,"Only after we got this did we learn about the battery issues; owner's manual says ""up to"" 40 minutes run time. Are they kidding? At this price 40 minutes?? I've emailed to see if there is an upgrade battery, couldn't find one on their site. Not worth the $$$!"
4,great toy,"The razor 4wheeler is a great toy for a 6 or 7 year old. It is very well built and designed for ease of operation. there was a problem with the battery, but razor sent us another battery and now it works great. Our 6 year old grand daughter rides from her house to our house, which is about 300 ft (a football field length). The terain has hills, but presents no problem. She loves it and it was also a surprise to us how well it holds up. I would recommend it to anyone with a child that is in the 50 to 75lb range.....wdn"
1,don't buy the Razor dirt quad,"We purchased this for Christmas '06. It has run a total of about 3 months. We have replaced batteries, wheel bearings, and charger. Now we still can't get it to charge. We have also tried to call Razor customer service & haven't gotten much help there. I've told my kids that Santa doesn't shop at Razor anymore!"
3,razor customer service is horrible,"do not even attempt to call customer service for any problems with your razor dirt quad. they are programmed like robots to keep repeating, ""i'm sorry, there is nothing we can do"" ""i'm sorry there is nothing we can do"" blah blah blah....does anyone ever notice that these big companies do not stand by their own products....any yet we keep making them rich with our hard earned money!!!!!i'm sorry razor, there is something we can do, like not buying your junk anymore."
5,Awesome,This product is great! All assembled but all I had to do was put on the handelbars. My son rides this for hours on end. One word AWESOME!!
3,Razor dirt quad,"We were so thrilled to see someone finally manufacturing a children's ride on toy with sturdy rubber wheels that travels at more than 3 miles per hour. We bought this for my 7 year old son thinking it would be a great alternative to the ""real"" thing. I think this is a very sturdy ride on, however, the thing scares the living daylights out of me when the kids get on it. Just the slightest sharp turn and your child is sure to hit the pavement. We do not allow any of the neighborhood kids to ride it and have since upgraded to a gas powered atv. My opininon is that for a little more money, buy yourself the real thing. These are far too dangerous with the tipping factor and it was very disappointing how short of time the battery stays charged. If you do buy this for your child, an appropriate helmet is a MUST! I find this product to be far more dangerous than a real four wheeler. Good luck!"
3,Adequate for under 5 years old,"My 5 year old was thrilled with this product. As he normally drives safely at 10 mph, it would have been better to get a gas ATV. The battery does not last more than a half hour and since the battery is not removable, we can't charge a back up battery.We have also found that when it is very cold out, he can not ride it as it makes a clicking noise.He still loves it and we are glad we got one for him."
1,Very Dangerous,We have bought many razor items and have liked them a lot. So we thought the dirt quad should not be any different. Not 2 seconds on it and the slightest turn and he was on the ground. This continually would happen while riding it. It seems to go a little faster than the 8mph it says. Also it sits high and the wheel base is not wide enough to handle turns. It made me very uneasy. I just want to warn other people so their child does not get hurt.
2,Charging problems poor customer service from razor,Purchased this item from Amazon. Item was brand new and charger was defective. My son used the item twice and charger was faulty indicating green as if battery was charged. I called Razor they said most likely a defective charger. they advised I take unitapart check wiring and if all wires are connected properly to return charger and they will send out a new charger. I refused and returned item to Amazon. I received a replacement quad from Amazon and after 5 uses the quad is doing the same thing. I complained to a supervisor at Razor he sent me out a new charger and so far this charger is working.keep in mind however item has only been charged twice since receiving the new charger.
4,so far so good,"I brought this for my 8 year old daughter as a step up from the plastic quads. She loves it. I would like to see a quicker batt. charge time. She drives it for 30 minites stright but it then needs 8 hours of charge time. By the look of her face everytime she rides it, it was worth the money."
5,good product,"We were pleasantly surprised with this product! It is well built and runs great. The quality and performance really exceeded our expectations, even with all of the helpful reviews provided. As the saying goes, once bitten twice shy. Your kids will love this 4 wheeler and you will not be disappointed."
4,Fun Christmas 4-wheeler,My 4 year old son loved the 4-wheeler. It is very sturdy and the shocks are great! It did not stay charged very long like most of the reviews we read said. We are going to try to get a new battery. Overall we really like the product. And on Amazon the price was great especially with the free shipping!!
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I thought the dirt quad would be a step above the toddler type Power Wheels products. Our kids own the jeep and the 4 wheeler, and I wanted something with a little more power without having to jump in to the gas powered market. This unit seems very dinky, and it doesn't even stay charged for an hour. We bought 2, and one doesn't stay charged as long as the other one. Also, I noticed the minimum age limit is 8 - I can't imagine anyone older than 8 on this dirt quad unless they are short for their age. My long legged 7 year old sits with her knees almost to her chest.If it wouldn't disappoint the kids and if it wouldn't cost me over $100 a piece to ship them back, I would probably return them and get the kids something better."
3,Only for a 4-6 year old......,Definitely a riding toy for a 4 to 6 year old depending on height and weight. Battery life for riding hard is 40 minutes. 2 hours to charge. It is a good toy for my 5 year old. The battery life gives us a break from watching over him.
2,I followed directions and still a poor charge!,"This quad looks great and concept is great. However the battery and charging system is horrible. I read the previous reviews and read all the manufacturer's directions to make sure I'm charging it correctly. On a full charge they can only ride for about 20 minutes at best. Also, it should be known that the child riding it only weighs 40 lbs. The neighbors have an identical one and theirs seems to last longer and also goes considerably faster. I think there is a risk when buying this that you may get one with a bad battery. The batteries are way to expensive for me to justify buying a new to see if it improves performance. I would not buy this toy again and I do not recommend it because you could get stuck with a bad one like mine."
5,Very Happy!,"Santa brought this 4 wheeler to my daughter two years ago. We have not had any problems with it at all. She had just turned 5 when we purchased it and we were concerened it would be to fast but not at all. Within a few times of riding it she was comfortable and has riden it now for 2yrs and she still loves it! It goes great in the snow as well, if it isn't too deep. My daughter is not tomboyish at all, she is average size. I hope this review helps."
3,a little smaller than I thought,"Bought this for my 7 yr old for Christmas. it says its for ages 8 and up but he is almost too big and he is on the small side. lots of power, and he absolutely loves it but he will outgrow it by the time summer is over. wish it had reverse."
5,WOW,My 5 Year Old Son Loves This.It Has The Battery Life Stated In The Owners ManualIt Does Not Seem To Have A Much Speed As The Razor Pocket RocketBut All The Kids Around Here Love It...Had A Pergo But It Was Slow And All Plastic (JUNK) Took It Back To The StoreThis Has A Metal Frame NICE!!!
1,Unhappy Customer!!,"Unfortunatly this item broke after the first day that my son rode it on Xmas day! I have been waiting on the new part from Razor now for 2 weeks, as it was supposed to be here in 7 to 10 days. I have not been successful at reaching anyone at Razor and cannot even get through on the number that was provided.Needless to say I have not been happy with this purchase up to this point!"
3,Cheesy cherries,"This singing and harmony on this album is very good considering the lack of editing available back when it was recorded, but I found the over-all effect to be rather dated. It's good value for money in that there are quite a number of songs but the songs are such that you are quite happy that they finish without much ado. I bought the album hoping to hear more of a jazz angle, with some instrumental breaks, because I know that some of their albums/songs were more along that line. I was dissapointed."
5,"Hardhitting, humorous, and practical.","Garrett speaks ""with"" his readers,rather than to them. His personable, wry style keeps you turning the pages, as he breaks down the complex issue of addiction into practical, palatable bites, while not pulling any punches about how it can wreak havoc in our lives. At the same time, optimism and and a strong belief that anyone can find freedom from addiction shines throughout the pages. Down to earth, every day suggestions give a newcomer solid information about where to start, and how to hang in, all along the way. This personal, common sense primer is an excellent guide for those seeking a sober life free of bondage to alcohol and drugs."
4,Good story.action. plot^^,I like d grey man and all it stories...but if your a real fan of D grey man ..just note that this is season 1 in parts and very short parts so you would have to get this other boxes to have season one . BUT if you collector get it any way you love the chance to hear it in jap and eng ..^^
5,2 unlimited,"finaly i found it!i was desperat to find this cd for some years.thank you very much to make my dream come trueit was new like you said, a must have for the fans."
5,Excellent,"I love 2 Unlimited. I had no knowledge of them during the 90s, they were not on Chicago radio. Chgo radio had good dance/trance/rave on B96 until 1993 or so, then for some reason, they stopped playing. Not until 1998, a college radio station featured hot dance music, which morphed into Energy radio in 2001...then they went off the air! Arrghh!!I found 2Unlimited through Amazon, featured on the Jock Jams collections. So many things in life, I wonder, why didn't I know about this sooner??...and I was not a hermit or living in a cave.I play 2 Unlimited all the time now. Hope they reunite so we can see them again."
4,It tastes good,"I recently tried to find my food allergies by going on an ""elimination diet"" which initially means I could not eat any foods with any wheat, dairy, corn, refined sugar, etc. This millet rice cereal got me through this initial period because it actually tasted good. I would eat it with my rice milk and whatever fruit I was allowed to eat at the time. I also liked it because it is crisp and does not get soggy too fast like some other cereals I tried. The larger size of this bag was handy and less expensive than buying the smaller boxes."
5,Best Cereal Ever,"I can't say enough good things about Nature's Path Millet Rice Cereal. I eat this EVERY morning, with blueberries and banana slices. It is delicious and contains NO sugar (sweetened with fruit juice) and NO white flour. I started eating this cereal shortly after I recovered from cancer after following an alternative treatment that is heavy on nutrition.To find out more about my amazing battle with cancer, purchase a copy of my book here:God Said Not Yet!: One Man's Experience With ""Terminal"" Cancer"
1,This product has been ruined,"My family used to love this cereal, but not anymore. The formula was changed recently; it becomes a soggy mess as soon as you add soy/almond/rice milk. Why did they change it?"
5,5 Stars a no brainer...,The sound quality is superior and the classic Teddy voice is strong and soulful..highly recommended.
5,Teddy Pendergrass good solid soul,This CD is excellent. Teddy Pebdergrass has such a soulfulvoice. This CD is excellent. The song LOVE TKO is a masterpieceand fits well into this CD
1,Deeply disturbing book,"Not only is the subject matter disturbing, but the way in which the author has manipulated her data to prove her bias is just as disturbing. One of her ""anonymous informants"" was a 70 year old woman who was relating her memories as a 5 to 7 year old child. Ms. Blee repeatedly refered to her as and active participant! Her depiction of ""Lillian Rouse"", my grandmother, is a concoction that is not recognizable at all. Her notes in relation to her interview with my mother are not correct. She has taken bits and pieces and manipulated them to prove her point, reguardless of the facts. If what she has done to my mother's information is indicative of how she (mis)used other information, I cannot put much credance in her work."
1,"Interesting, but...","As I read Ms. Blee's book, I am concerned that she is using information from people who are now about 70 years old, who would have been small children when the Klan was in power, to make such all encompasing statements about the Klan. A child sees the world around him much differently than an adult. A child would relish going to parades, parties, gatherings and enjoy them. If Ms. Blee asks the participants to describe their feelings as a child, then reports them as their current feelings, then the reader must be aware of the bias of the author. Did Ms. Blee ask the participants of her interviews what their feelings were 65 years ago, or what their feelings are now, on reflection? I know that she asked the former and used that information to substantiate her own biases about the Klan."
1,Manipulation of fact to support her preconceived thesis,"Ms. Blee has many flaws in her research, documentation, interpretation and conclusions. At worst this is a conscious manipulation of fact to support Ms. Blee's preconceived thesis. At best it is a work of pure fiction."
4,Best so far,I am not a protein drinker person but when I started working out it was recommended to me so I figured I'd try. I tried several different brands and didn't like them then I picked this up at Meijer (it's renamed in the store under Meijer brand) and liked it. In the beginning I did have a little gas but that subsided.
1,looseness of the bowel,This protein gives you a horrible stomach ache and severe diarrhea the times I used it ... was hoping it would only occur once or twice but every time I drink this protein it give me the runs ... Other proteins do not bother me at all ... you get 5 pounds for a low price however its not worth the severe diarrhea
4,This could really happen.,"""Cold Shoulder"" is a very thought provoking book. I started it a few days ago and absolutely hate putting it down. I have about 20 more pages to go and can't wait to get home today to finish it. I have sympathy for Lorraine and cannot imagine being in her situation, yet, I know there are women who have to resort to prostitution to survive (if you can call that surviving). Every now and then I need to read a book like this because it makes me appreciate my life as well as rethink through my problems. I don't have any compared to Lorraine. Also, being somewhat familiar with alcoholism since it runs in my family helps me to understand how truly devastating a person can become because of it. It is a tough fight. Great book!"
1,One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read,"This book has severe flaws in logic, so much so that it was painful to read. I only plowed through it because I didn't have anything else to read. Save your money and your time."
1,"Lazy, badly researched junk","I love the Anna Travis series and had high hopes for Lorraine Page - I was sorely disappointed. Overwrought, under-researched, completely improbable and way too long. If you want to read great present-day stories about LA cops stick to Robert Crais and Michael Connelly."
1,Careless writing ruins it,"The concept is okay, but the characters are cookie-cutter and the style, such as it is, consists of cliches from cover to cover. From the way LaPlante does love to focus on alcoholism you reckon she would have some experience of it or researched it a bit, but none of it rings true. And the plot just does not make sense. She has her main cop drink six fingers of bourbon straight down, twice, then start the third drink rather more sedately. Get real! And he's supposed to be on duty, and he's driving everywhere? It appears that everything LaPlante knows about American cops she's read in trashy novels or seen on trashy TV shows. In other words, nothing. They have ample reason to arrest their main suspect, with a good third of the novel left to go, with full means of eliminating him from the inquiry, but don't dare because he's rich. Dragging it out for dramatic effect like this does not make up for lack of imagination."
4,Beginning of the Cold War...,"I didn't expect much from this thriller but it was surprisingly good. I usually forget plots and character names shortly after reading a book, but the fact I still remember the name ""Lorraine Page"" a year after reading Cold Shoulder is a testament to LaPlante's three-dimensional drawing of a memorable character.Lorraine Page is a woman who had it all then lost it. She was a beautiful, competent cop who was happily married with a child. Her first mistake was falling in love with her partner; her second mistake was becoming an alcoholic when he was killed in the line of duty; her third mistake was killing a suspect while drunk. She gets fired, her husband leaves her, and she's left to wander around aimlessly.She then stumbles on to a serial killer, and uses her detective skills to find out the truth.The ride is fun and you really care about this flawed and very human character."
4,A Private Eye Tries to Get Sober After Years of Binge Drinking,"I really like Lynda LaPlante's writing. Her characterization of the protagonist in this book is exemplary. Some of you may not realize that she is the primary screen writer for the BBC series 'Prime Suspect'.The story focuses on Lorraine, an ex-cop who spends years on a drunken binge and as a prostitute after losing her partner and inadvertently killing an innocent 16 year-old while drinking on duty. She loses her children and her husband because of her drinking.This book begins as she's struggling to become sober. She investigates a murder involving transsexuals, pornographers, and other bits of kinkiness. Some of the pieces don't fit together and the end is disappointing but the twists and turns are good, the writing heads and tails above the caliber of the usual mystery. Additionally, the development of Lorraine's character make this book a great page-turner."
4,the survival of lorraine page,"This is my first Lynda La Plante book, I only read it because a friend gave me it and I will now look out for Lynda's other works.This is the story of the survival of Lorraine Page who had the 'great' job, the loving husband and children but who hit the bottle and rock bottom,losing everything including herself. It is a dark and sad story about the people we all look down on, who walk the streets and sell themselves for their choice of drug or alcohol. Lorraine Page begins to drag herself out of her 'grave', with the help of her new found friends, when she becomes the victim of an attack. Although it is sad it is a great story of survival. Well worth reading!!!"
1,Not available in Africa,It is so frustrating to discover titles you want to purchase & then find out that they are not available in Africa!
2,Great start but the story line falls apart.,"I like this author, but this story falls apart under the weight of a not too well thought out mystery. Plus the characters are so diverse it seems impossible that they would be in the same story, and have no conflict."
5,I FEEL MANY SONGS (IN MY HEART AGAIN),"Here is another beautiful work of Gladys Knight and The Pips to Buddah Records! ""I Feel A Song (In My Heart Again)"" was a hit in 1975. This album clearly shows the art of Gladys Knight in each song and it could be a good mirror for many female singers of today that think that to sing ""soulfully"" a song is just to shout hystericaly without meaning or feeling. In ""I Feel A Song"", Gladys is angry and secure, in ""The Way We Were"" is reflective, in ""Better You Go Your Way"", happy, in ""The Need To Be"" (one of her best performances) is pungent,in ""Tenderness Is His Way"" (another great performance) romantic, distant, in another world... A CD to hear from the beginning 'til the end!"
4,"memories of San Diego,Ca 1984","I've always been a huge Patti(and Labelle for that matter)fan. Back in 1984 I was atttending Radioman ""A"" school in San Diego,Ca when we got the news that Patti Labelle,Luther Vandross,Bobby Womack(w/Sly Stone for like 10 minutes) and The New Edition were doing a show at Chargers Stadium for $17:00 bucks...we knew we had too go!! I recall this particular Labelle album with the track ""if only you knew"" a smooth soulful piece that stills rings in my mind today,this album was a big deal in 1984 as we would play it(on cassette tape ofcourse) throught the barracks. The rest of the album is great. I really cant say enough about this album that has'nt been said already towards the positive note."
2,Disappointing,It became quickly apparent that this is primarily an art film. Unfortunately the special effects detracted from the interestings clips where the scientists spoke on the topic of evolution. The distorted voice segments were frustrating in that you could only understand a few words here and there. Overall disappointing.
4,Good Mixes,Nice single with some cool remixes of this song. I particularly like the Nickel Bag version which is a jazzed out version that's pretty different from the album version. Here's a track listing:1. Hey Man Nice Shot (Sober)2. Hey Man Nice Shot (Nickel Bag)3. Hey Man Nice Shot (1/4 Pound)4. Hey Man Nice Shot (Big Mac)5. White Like That (Dictaphone Version)
3,2.46,"The story line is incoherent futuristic surrealistic-abstract, while future, present, and past are co-relating to Tony's affairs.To understand this movie better, it'd be better to read symbols instead of picking up the time and the space; and to name a few:* A train of time and memories connects the stories of his encounters.* The android represents one of his encounters, Faye, and himself as Faye's Japanese boyfriend.* Different (speaking) dialects between he and each encounter foreshadow a unrequited relationship.Besides playing the elements of a movie and giving an ostensible beautiful incoherent directing, the story and the movie lack an extension and expansion of the protagonist's passion while interacting with other (over-acting) actresses.I give this movie 2.46 points."
2,Lush. Gorgeous. Interminable.,"The idea that another viewer might spend more than two non-returnable hours watching this well-acted, beautiful and pretentious film was enough for me to overcome my reluctance to comment on it.Two brief points:1.) This film was shot without a script. This will not come as a surprise to anyone who has seen it.2.) In the DVD extras, actress Ziyi Zhang (who plays Bai Ling) confesses with a nervous laugh, ""None of us knew what the film was about."""
2,2046 is it really that long!!,"The trailer was better than the movie. Though it was beautifully filmed it was to long. The trailer was a bit misleading, but no spoiler here. If the movie was 30 minutes shorter it would have been better, it had more false endings than Lord of the Rings. I would have loved to give it a five, but it just didn't make the cut!"
5,Wow.,"After watching this film, you know you've just seen the work of a filmmaker at the top of his game. Wong Kar Wai has done some fascinating work. In the mood for love and Days of being wild are both masterpieces. But in 2046 he manages to put together the sort of layering that i thought was only possible in lengthy novels. Story builds on top of story between two parallel worlds, one real and one fictional. The score's amazing, the imagery is compelling, and the writing is sharp as a knife. If you're a fan of WKW and haven't seen this movie, then you shouldnt immiedietly go find a copy and a good place to view it. If you've never heard of Wong Kar Wai, I'd recommend watching Days of Being wild first. And if you're not into films revolving around intense human relations with each other, i wouldn't recommend any of Wong Kar Wai's work. Because honestly, that's a good 75% of what his movies revolve around."
4,Check it out...,Definitely don't pass up this movie. It's beautifully filmed with interesting characters and an original plot. It may move a little slow at times but it's definitely worth the trip...
2,Pointless and boring film,"I cannot understand those who give more than 3 stars for this film.It is the most disappointing film from Wong Kar Wai. Visually, the film looks stunning. But there is really no plot or storyline and the characters are boring. The story doesn't really go anywhere. It is almost like an exercise in aesthetics.Maybe not having a written script is not a good idea for this film. It might have worked for his past films but certainly not with this one.And my personal fave of WKW would be In the Mood for Love, which I recommend highly. It is such a beautiful film, from the visuals, the storyline, the acting, the set, everything is perfectly done. Even the smoke from the cigarettes creates a certain mood/nostalgia.Also, Happy Together is another film from WKW that I like.But this one is a total mess. It was pointless."
3,poor Maggie? Poor AUDIENCE.,"I'm so mad at the director for not using Maggie's scenes but in Aspberger fashion, one could say that the exclusion serves the point of the story. The woman you want to see is not there and it sucks and is unsatisfying. No one hits the mark and provides the poignancy, the sweetness, the age and of course, the tannin that would drive someone to seek solace at Angkor Wat.I'm still mad at him though."
1,You have GOT to be kidding ...,"Why is it the greatest part of many films are the previews. If this director and screenwriter woiuld have spent as much time on the move as they did on the preview this may have been an interesting film.Unless I guess you keep a bong very nearby while watching this film I will guarantee that the viewer will have absolutely NO idea as to what is going on at any one point in time. The film most certainly is very Oriental with the dark and brooding images, the compulsory 'player type' bad boy and of course we need the chain smoking super sexy bright lipstick female lead.To say that I was disappointed with the lack of substance would be an understatement!"
3,Good But Flawed,"There is nothing wrong with the music on this disc...it is all good, and does paint a pretty good picture of Asha's music. However, as a really solid overview or a good introduction, it has been far outdone elsewhere. For a collection truly packed with classics, find a copy of the 2-CD set ""The Golden Collection,"" or, for a more thorough overview which leaves few gems overlooked, the 5-discs of ""Legends - the Enchantress."" If neither of those is available, then this remains an adequate place to start."
4,sustaining voice,"the collection is average for an indian like me, who has been hearing countless beautiful songs by her, now vampy, now wispy, now delicate, now demanding, now the empress, now the soul, now the sorrow.....what not from her. it could have helped for non-indians to appreciate her magic including songs like Mera kuch saman- fm ijazat, phir se aaiyo, kaali haath sham aaye, gaa mere man gaa, etc.if anyone wants to savour her songs...listen to her with your eyes closed..or not...she will enchant you with her magic...yes for me...magic of the voice is asha bhosle."
5,Truely Best !,Really all the songs are simply great ! They are one of the greatest hits in Bollywood music. It also covers all the music directors for whom Asha worked .
2,An average book,"I have read through much of this book, and I was quite dissapointed. In my opinion, it's not worth the avg review of 4.5 stars.The book starts with introductory chapters, that's fine for new users. But after that, it continues to follow the path of giving out code by code, with little exlaination of the real world requirements and the implemented mechanism.The book lack a chapter for CFML language (types, functions, etc), which should be placed in the beginning part and should be a base for further learning.The chapters on application framework and session variables is not even as clear as Allair's online documentation, which is brief itself.The chapter about custom tag should be place on this book, not on ""advanced"" one, as modular design should be used in the first place, and not many designers/developers have time to read both books before starting their projects.This book contains some good parts though."
1,Garbage!,"If you interested in learning Cold Fusion, don't waste your time or money on this book. Difficult to understand and poorly written. What a dissapointment!..."
1,One of the most useless books I've had,"I can't believe this book has got such good ratings. It's horrible. It has some useful examples I'll admit, but the appendix is useless. Trying to find detailed information about how a tag works? Don't bother looking in this book."
5,Web development made easy,I've used many Web development tools that supposedly do a lot of stuff. But after using ColdFusion and reading this well managed book I realized other companies are just trying to follow Allaire's foot step. This book is the best of breed in Web development with ColdFusion 4.0. I stongly recommend it to starters and advenced developers.
3,CF3.0 Admin? I don't think so.,I would have really liked this book if it had included the admin pages and details from ColdFusion 4 rather than just retaining information from CF3. I think it is a shame that this is the case considering that the cover states that this book is for CF4. The administration is the thing that requires an explination as the documentaion is completely vauge and nearly useless.
1,"Frustrating, poorly written, waste of money","I really resent the apparent laziness with which this book was written. It's riddled with typos and screenshots that don't match the text. To make matters worse, many of the screenshots are clearly from ColdFusion 3.0. Come on, Ben!"
4,"A++ on general CF & SQL stuff, D on client&session vars","This is an excellent book for newbies on Coldfusion. However, I must say the client & session variables section is not explained as well as other parts of the book.This topic is THE core of developing sites, so if you are serious about Coldfusion, you'll need to get this one and another book..."
5,Excellent Resource Book,"Although there are a few typos and mismatched screencaps in the book, all in all it is well worth the price if you're getting started in ColdFusion. The author leads you into it gradually but not dragging it out too long. It's nice to have the sections on database mgt and normalization (esp. Access vs SQL Server). A nice touch that helps too."
2,Too Much Like the Last Edition,"This book is an excellent resource, without question. However, this edition contains much of the same information as the last one. There are many improvements in Cold Fusion 4.0 that, unfortunately, are not covered in this book. I hope the Advanced book makes up for this edition's shortcomings."
2,Not much different then the Last edition!,"Although Ben has written an excellent reference guide to Cold Fusion, his latest edition is about 95% the same as the previous edition. I was expecting more information on Structures and <CFSCRIPT> tags but $50 for the same info I can read in the software manuals is a little much. I hope his other book ""Application Development"" contains more information"
1,Too many mistakes to be a credible resource,"This hastily-written book is littered with typographical errors which make the tutorials frustrating to follow -- and therefore useless -- for beginners. Intermediate developers may find the typos tolerable, but the errors and omissions leave readers doubting the credibility of the material, the author, and ultimately the publisher. I liken this book to a bad beer -- you can get through it, but the aftertaste is enough to turn you away."
2,"If you want to, wait for Cold Fusion 5, 4th Edition","If you are new to Cold Fusion, then this is the book for you. It is one of the most enjoyable technical books that I have read. However, if you if you have the 2nd Edition, the information in the 3rd Edition is only 5-10% new. Case and point, there are several screen grabs from Cold Fusion 3.0 and chapters that are verbatim the same as the 2nd Edition. In my opinion, the publisher and authors were not being honest to their loyal following. Please make adjustments for Cold Fusion 5, 4th Edition. Congrats, being number #36 in sales rank. Integrity is everything boys and girls!"
2,Decent but overrated,"I am new to cold fusion and found this book incomplete. For example, the interaction/linking of IIS and CF is not explained in any detail. It assumes everything installs out-of-the-box and every PC has the same configuration as the authors'. If you are new to CF buy this book along with the 'Dummies"" book and you should be in good shape. Use the Dummies book for the installation and setup and some straight forward examples. This book builds on the Dummies examples. However, this book alone may cause you undue frustration - lots of typos and weak explainations. How about the 4 pages on using Seagate Crystal Reports with CF - why even mention it! (Why does he make you build the database? The book has a CD - just include one as an MS Access file. Duh! )"
3,"Good resource, but not many changes",I had read the previous version of this book. What I can say is that not many changes were made to the newest one. It's still a great book for those who just started to learn ColdFusion. That's why I give this book 3 starts.
2,Another Computer Wiz trying to write a book,"On page 935, for a definition of the ""Evaluate"" function, Mr. Forta writes ""Evaluate is used to evaluate string expressions. Evaluate takes one or more string expressions as parameters and evaluates them left to right. The following example evaluates the variable ""A"" : #Evaluate(""A"")#."" Gee, Thanks for clearing that up."
4,Very good for the beginner to intermidiate...,"I purchased this book because my place of employment recently began using Cold Fusion 4 to aid in the development of Web to Database applications. I found this book to be extremely informative from the standpoint of knowing nothing about Cold Fusion. It covered the basic principles behind how it works, as well as installation issues, and then teaches you to create some simple yet useful project applications. The only thing I wish they would improve upon in this book is adding a little more on using it within an Intranet. Most of the installation and configuration guides are more concentrated on interaction on the Internet. Other then that, I would reccomend this book to anyone who is just starting to learn Cold Fusion or to those who know just a little about it already but want to learn more."
4,"The best book on ColdFusion, with noticeable weaknesses","The ColdFusion web application construction kit from Ben Forta is really an indispensable tool to master ColdFusion and learn all its features. It completes and goes beyond the scope of the documentation that comes with ColdFusion by giving you real-world examples of its features. From the beginning, you build and enrich a web application, using the exciting features of ColdFusion progressively. Paradoxically, the Online Commerce and other related functionality of ColdFusion (Lists, Arrays, Structures) are not well explained. The management of cookies, client variables, sessions are a bit confused. So, you'll still have questions after having read the whole book. Besides of that, if you're serious about ColdFusion development, buy this book and its companion: ""Advanced ColdFusion"" by the same author."
2,Too complex,"As the other readers noted in their reviews, I feel this book starts off great and become complex with a lack of explination of basic concepts. The chapter on SQL statments utilzes a utility called MS Query to explain SQL concepts,but, it does not include a copy of this utility with the book. I tried to recreate the examples utilizing the query tools located within Access but I was unsuccessful. I plan on returning this book and purchasing the SAMS reference manual."
5,The Bible for ColdFusion,This is the absolute best book on the market for ColdFusion Development. I am a certified coldFusion developer and have found this book to be in-valuable! I would have paid 10 times the price for this book if I would have known how much information was within this book! No other book compares.
3,"Overall good, but too many errors","The begining of the book and examples helped greatly, but towards the end chapters things got a little messy. Too many typos, and example errors. For a beginner it took me a long time to sort through that mess."
1,An obvious Pot Boiler and Embarrassment to the Publisher,"""How could the David McKay Chess Library Publish this?"" is the first question I asked after getting this book?Super OVERSIZED diagrams in an obvous attempt to ""cover up"" the obvious lack of material. Poor organization, inferior ways to accomplish what should be made simple for kids and a lack of telling the how and why of what is going on charactorized this ""masterful work"" of duping the public. I can recommend this book to noone."
1,Not an improvement,"I had purchased the same author's Chess Kid's Book of Tactics and though wasn't that pleased decided to take a chance and get his book on checkmates. I am not that advanced in chess and need help with the basics. My father has been helping me, but said I should get some books to study from too. I thought that maybe this book would have improved in the ability of the author to explane things. Not so.I agree with the revewer that said that the way this book shows checkmate with a King and a Queen is slow. My father showed me how to use my King to help with that checkmate and make it much, much faster. I want to learn to do things the best way from the start.I also found some of the things in the book to be very confusing."
3,Good Checkmate information.,"I've read some of the other reviews and I would have to say this book is just not that bad. First of all this is not for the absolute beginner, but for a beginner who at least knows basic rules and how to move the pieces. It has a nice easy feel to it; information is to the point and never drags on. It is basically as the title says a good review of checkmate information that the beginners should know. Some of the various mates reviewed are Anastasia's, Morphy's, Pillisbury's, Lolli's etc. There are just a couple of mistaken answers that didn't bother me one bit. The chess board diagrams are not quite 2""x2"", not over sized. I give it 3 1/2 stars, with a little more details and a few more examples this would have easily been a 4-5 star book."
2,Has some flaws,"This is a book containing checkmate puzzels designed for children. A fair number of the problems contain important patterns which are useful for finishing your game.The book contains some serious flaws. The demonstration of how to use a Queen to force checkmate against a lone King uses a slow and inefficient method, which takes about 2 times as long as it should to force the checkmate. Kids should be shown how to check mate efficiently. This very example stops numerous moves before the checkmate and then jumps to an example of the final checkmate position! It doesn't show the entire mate to save space in the book. To save space in the book the publisher should have not had such oversized diagrams.The book is also lacking in organization and is not as complete in material as it could be."
3,Tactics? Yes. Strategy? No so much.,"Making the News - A Guide for Activists and Nonprofits is an OK book.About one-third of the book covers strategic aspects of an activist media plan. That was the part in which I had an interest. I am always seeking a little more insight into the thinking behind the activist communications plan. However, the other two-thirds of the book was concerned with tactical matters.If you're an activist and you're looking for a ""how-to"" book on media tactics, then this work can help you. If you're looking for strategic insights, then probably other books will be what you seek."
5,From San Francisco Chronicle 12/8/02 (by Robert J. Bruss),"#1 of year's 10 top real estate books. This survey book explains virtually all the home-purchase alternatives, such as different types of houses and condos, as well as low-cost finance alternatives. Aimed at first-time buyers, this well-designed book explains home-buying techniques that less-than-perfect buyers should consider."
4,Practical Reference For Home Buyers,"This is a practical book for home buyers. However, it does not contain a wide-spectrum of information one'd expect. For example, information about town-house and condo are superficial. And there are other sections I'd expect the author to go a little bit more in detail. Even with all these concerns, this book and author should get credit where credit is due. It gives good guidelines and portrays a clear system of how to determine a good house buy."
2,Impractical advice,"I found this book to lack usefulness, more of a ""cheerleader"" for ""Yay you CAN buy a house"" rather than a useful tool to help you do so."
5,Great Book!! For first-time home buyers!!!,"Robert Irwin really gives the beginner home investor a great perspective in purchasing real estate. Very clear, easy to understand book. I really like how Irwin breaks down the method of the whole purchase of a house (there is alot more to buying a house than people think) and in this book he gives you a very clear understanding of how that is done. I encourage the beginner who wants to gain some knowledge in real estate to read this book, you will NOt under any circumstance feel as if you are wasting your time reading this at all. I gurantee you will be satisfied, and morover you will defintely learn numerous things from Irwins writings. So start learning real estate and how things work as well as ""Do's and Don'ts"" when buying your dream home."
3,Enjoyable,"I recently purchased this film on dvd because my old copy that was taped off AMC finally gave out. This is a spoof on the spy craze of the time and it serves that purpose. Whenever I see this film, I think of another film that starred Vincent Price and Susan Hart and that is War gods of the deep. Both of these films were made around the same time, but Price and Hart both seemed tired in that film. Everyone in this film really seems like they had fun doing this picture. Vincent Price is really sharp delivering dialogue that would fall flat coming from someone else's mouth. The print is sharp and colorful and the original trailer is included."
3,"A silly, but fun, spy spoof","Vincent Price is my favorite actor, and he is what makes this silly AIP ""teen"" movie worth watching. It is the story of Dr. Goldfoot (Price) and his diabolical plan to take over the world by having all of the wealthy men on the planet marry his robot bombshells. He will have the robot ""bikini women"" sign over all of the wealth to him, and voila...the world!There are some great moments featuring the beach blanket stars of the day, including Frankie Avalon, and good ol Annette makes a cameo appearance. The chase scene at the end of the film is a classic!The DVD transfer is great, and the film quality makes this nice to watch. Includes the Midnite Movies standard bonus of the theatrical trailer.To sum it up, this is a silly, silly movie. Don't expect anything profound and I think you'll be surprised at what fun it is to watch."
3,3 Stooges fans take notice...,"No, Moe, Larry n Curly Joe do not appear in this film. But ""Dr. Goldfoot's"" co writer is Edward Ullman who wrote some of the Three Stooges' best scripts. This explains why a lot of Stooge style gags & lines appear throughout the film. It is fun hearing the great Vincent Price using dialog taylored for the great Moe Howard (""Why do you listen to me when I'm wrong!""). And the scenewhere Avalon & Hickman try to escape only to encounter a different obsticle at each door was done in sevral of the Stooges' late 40s shorts (with Shemp)."
3,"Very Funny, Surprisingly Good Plot, and Some Fine Sexy Women","Okay, don't expect an epic film, but Mr. Vincent Price gives an excellent acting performance as an evil genius and the poor hapless chap who falls in love with this gorgeous, bikini-clad coed just to discover that she is a - can't give that away, but I can say that you will laugh and you will wish that this movie was rated a little more ""PG-13"" so that you could see some of the nice 1960's era bodies when the Ally McBeal look wasn't in style yet. A very funny movie that has a funnier ending and some good plot twists that make it worth owning!Steve"
4,Dr. Goldfoot,This is a cute comedy. It always makes me laugh. I would always watch it on tv when ever it came on. I was very pleased when I was able to buy it.
4,Where are the robot girls now?,"I liked the robots. Nice girls. I liked robot 11, Diane, played by Susan Hart. Frankie Avalon, the bumbling secret agent was charming. A fun movie not to be taken seriously. I know San Francisco and how difficult it is to find parking and drive through the crowded strets in 2003 is. What a breeze was 1966. Uncrowded streets and parking was availble.It would be sad to see how the beautiful Robot girls and Susan Hart look now in 2003. Aging spares nobody."
4,kinky 60s spy romp,I remember this film fondly. I enjoyed the film - I'm a fan of Vincent Price - but the car chase at the end of the film seemed to go on forever. However i still enjoyed seeing this film again.
5,"Frankie Avalon plays secret agent ""Craig Gamble""","Frankie Avalon stars in this fun and funny comedy movie playing secret agent ""Craig Gamble"" and is good in the role.Frankie is like always at his best comedy acting.If you like Frankie then you will like the movie."
2,Dr goldfoot,"For a 'sixties type' comedy it was okay.the girls were the best for their time,very nice even by todays standards. cuteoutfits and corny roles. I especially likedthe old movies for the cars! the only wayto see a 'brand new' chrysler in action isin a period release film. (or any of yourfavorite cars)"
1,Full of Fluff,"Yet another work of fluff about skyscrapers. This is simply eye candy with no depth or discussion of how the genre' will survive after 9/11. yawn, more garbage from the city that never sleeps..."
4,Lady Blue,"I ordered this CD after seeing Russell's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on the Internet; I was reminded what an incredible artist he is. I had not listened to Russell's music in years - hearing him again is so moving and most enjoyable. As the title ""Retrospect"" suggests, ""each fresh listning conveys new understanding of what Russell was and is""....Russell will not disappoint."
1,Its A Shame,"I have never heard of Gary Holy Bull Nor has he ever practice among the Lakota People on the Pine Ridge Reservation, I know there are many who say they are yuwipi Medicine men but I do like to think that this book can be honest atleast to say that Mr Holy Bull is not a Yuwipi Man. I do not tear this man down but the book and what is written about the ceremonies...Will the Truth ever come out?"
5,Thou art more temperate,"Alright, so some of you may be thinking: Romeo and Juliet...again? With so many spin offs of this epic classic I am sure most of you thought the same thing I did when I went to watch this Anime for the first time: lame. However, this is not your ordinary Romeo and Juliet tale.All I can say, is Gonzo is brilliant. This story line is not only quite original (even for being loosely based on Shakespeare's tragedy) it is stunning to look at. The animation quality is second to none and all of the characters are easy to fall in love with. There are a few allusions to Shakespeare's other works in this tale and conveys more plot development than just two teens being in an impossible love.If you love Shakespeare, anime, action, romance, death, and mild violence I really recommend this series for you and the one you love!"
5,"Excellent story, great anime!~","Romeo X Juliet...just finished few minutes ago and was so great anime. The anime has excellent plot that follow the sequent of the main story. The music is perfect well the compositor is the same of ff12. I do not considered this anime has episodes ""filler""(every episode show you more about the story and the characters). Not every story had perfect ending but this one is great one!. I recommend this anime to everyone!!! :) I LOVE ITTTTTTTTTTTTT!!! LOVE YOU ROMEO & JULIET. Thank you Fumitoshi Oizaki(director of anime)You Should be Watching it.Love is something you never regret. Learn about this story..."
5,Don't Forget...,"If you're thinking of this album, also track down the video - every track on the album has an intense, visionary clip, more like independant cinema than music video, that still leave today's clips far behind."
1,God let me live but didn't let the others die.,"And to the self-proclaimed agnostic survivor, maybe you need to work out some of your own problems with your ordeal before you accuse others of being arrogant.And you need to become an intelligent adult before you turn on your 'puter again. That person was wasn't claiming to be a survivor. And only you know what a ""Self proclaimed agnostic"" is since agnostics don't have a licensing procedure. Please calm your hysteria!"
5,God was the co-pilot on Flight 232,"Jerry is a seemingly ordinary man sharing his raw honest account of a tragedy unfolding and its even more important aftermath. Though his gifts lie not in writing, they are clearly evident in much worthier traits as integrity, honesty and humility. I was reminded while reading this book that when God has a plan He will use Christians and non-Christians alike to carry it through. Jerry's account was so vivid that I actually found myself emotionally drained after each sitting-but equally I found myself encouraged by all the things that went right. There were many miracles that can be easily overlooked when focused on the tragedy itself. The secret things belong to Me and I will reveal the things I want you to know. Deut. 29:29 Chosen to Live is a beautiful book."
5,Not Free SF Reader,"Ok, he's done it again. Another great book. Taking the creepy politico-mystery from the first book, and mutating through that to an out and out action thriller by the end. Just great fun. Put Mr. Hamilton down as still on the list of 'will read anything he writes'. Highly recommended. Really, really, long, and could be used as a weapon, in hardback! :)"
4,Very good,Impossible to conclude some of this massive universal travelogue - discovering the underlying facts removes the mysteries. The journey is worth the trip.
3,"Hire an editor, please!","Like most of Mr. Hamilton's work, Judas Unchained begins well although picking up the plot strands from the first volume in the series is a little tough. But this book is too long and needs editing to delete at least a third of the inflated text. Numerous subplots weaken the main narrative threads and destroy the momentum that sometimes begins to build when the main plot lines are being developed. The book becomes tedious after the first 400 pages. It was a relief to finally see its end."
4,Pretty decent,"This is the second half of ""Pandora's Star"" (where did they get these awful titles from?). This book doesn't stand alone by itself, you need to read the other one first or it'll make no sense.That said, this is pretty good stuff, decent traditional sci-fi. The ending is a bit disappointing though - not a big surprise after the Night's Dawn series. Not as bad as that ending though."
1,Avoid the Dramatis Personae (cast of characters)!!!!,"AVOID THE DRAMATIS PERSONAE (the list of the cast of characters) at the beginning FOR IT CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!I don't know if it's just the Kindle edition that puts it in the front of the book just before the beginning of the actual story text, but avoid it! I didn't flip through the whole cast, but there were two in the beginning that told me what was going to happen, one being fairly minor and the other having the potential to be quite major (I don't know how major because I'm still reading it, but it's shaping up to be very significant).ONE STAR for the spoiler beginningFOUR STARS for the actual book, at least so farApologies for weighing down the ratings for a book I'm enjoying, but I believe the warning is more likely to be seen this way by newcomers than if I were to give it more stars."
3,Entertaining yarn that could have fit well in 1/3 the pages used,"The prior reviewer who mentioned that it would be helpful to read this book shortly after Pandora's S tar was on target. Turns out the characters were so thinly drawn that they were swept away under the torrent of detail of endless cat and mouse between the various human protagonists, traitors, heros and alien implacables. Another sort of writer might have been able to pull it off, but instead the temptation to just skip pages to keep to the essentials of the core narrative was high. In retrospect, little would have been lost. Still, the ideas are intriguing and push the reader to turn the pages, even if more rapidly than the author might like."
2,just way too long,"I think this may be my last attempt at Mr Hamilton's books (being the third, Fallen Dragon, and then this series). Like the other books, I just find them way too long. This book weighted in at just over 1200 pages, and I think at a minimum should have lost at least 400 pages.The story itself is not bad, but it is just buried too deep in drug-out descriptions and non-essential story lines that by the time I final finished, I was more relieved than impressed. Finishing the book felt like getting to the weekend after a week of work at a job you almost like....the work being = the book.I also grew tire of the author's jr high-ish glee in sex scenes. Many or most of the main characters (10-20) are all sleeping with each other or have at some point in the past. If I want to buy erotica, then I can choose to buy it, but I thought I was buying some SF"
3,ok but long and weak ending,Good reading except the end sequence. It dragged on forever and was kinda anti-climactic. It seemed that Hamilton spent many pages building situations that would justify a less-than-exciting ending. I just wanted it to end after awhile.
3,Need a good editor and more focus story line,"Hamilton needs to take the following 3 suggestions more than anything:1. Get a good editor to trim away all those fat in the story that are not critical to the main story.2. Multiple storylines that seem un-connected are interesting at the beginning, but it gets old real quick, and if after 700+ pages the author still writes in that form it becomes downright annoying.3. No more enzyme-bonded concrete pls, yes, no more...Having said the above, Hamilton did improve on these regard, which are nothing but my own personal opinion, in his later ""Void"" saga."
3,Marathon story,"Was a good read BUT it was way too long, 1,000 pages. I found myself saying ""c'mon already"" way, way, way too many times. He did wrap it all up nice and tidy at the end, in about 30 pages. He is good with dialogue and has good characters, aliens, etc. but again, (as I wrote in my review of Pandora's Star part 1 and another agonizing 1,000 pages) he spends way too much time and ink for me describing scenes. I sometimes think these guys forget they're supposed to be telling us a story and instead want to try and amaze us with their grasp of techno-gab. He doesn't write above your head but just uses it as filler. Hamilton needs an editor to tell him to cut some of the BS to better keep the readers attention. Story is good BUT c'mon already! Recommended if you like marathon stories."
3,"well written, entertaining, but flawed","Actually, I am a fan of Peter Hamilton's writing, but found too many technical and conceptual flaws in this series. In Pandora's Star, the idea of transporting a neutron star into the center of a gas giant is certainly a very novel idea until you realize that the gas giant would then probably mass more than the entire solar system, which would then accrete into one giant glob which wouldn't be cool for all the folks trying to live there.Unfortunately, Peter appears to be pandering to black folks,with his 400 year old black genius who is apparently developmentally arrested in 20th century hip talk and a somewhat anachonistic ""afro"". He then embarks on some ridiculous Quixotic quest to save a race of unspeakably evil beings who will continue to be a horrific threat to the entire universe. I'm afraid it was at this point I put the book down and gave it away. Peter you are capable of so much more."
1,Dull Dull Dull big brick of a book,"No actionNo humourNo compelling charactersNo mind-bending escapismNo nothing!Pity MorningLightMountain didn't waste the entire f''''' confederation.C'mon Peter - this is pulp fiction of the worst, dullest, most banal kind. It is an insult to all aspiring writers who see major book publishers descending to the lowest depths of quality by printing this kind of rubbish.Makes me wanna give up reading and steal my kid's play-station.I wish there was a 0 star field.J"
1,Terrible,"Look with whom Melanie have sex with at the end. Yes, a BOY! Have P. Hamilton have no taste?And the whole idea for this book was stolen from Douglas Adams ( remember Krikkit?)Disgusting book..."
2,An editor wanted!,"Great main story, and the hostile aliens was superb! But... as the predecessor ""Pandoras Planet, there are too many characters and subplots that didn't go any were. A condensed version... cut away 40%, and it could have been an classic."
3,Not up to par with Pandora's Star,"Long awaited, the second part of the story is somewhat disappointing, even for a PFH fan. I was left with the impression the author couldn't decide how long the novel should be, padded the middle with some inconsequential storylines and excruciating details, and finished it rather abruptly (and predictably, I might add). On the plus side, all the storylines end in a satisfactory manner, by explaining most of the mysteries introduced earlier. All in all, a must read for the fans of Pandora's Star as a logical continuation, but don't get your expectations too high."
3,"Too many pages, too many characters","I've read all Hamilton's books, and I really enjoyed the first volume of this 2 part series, but this second book just goes on forever.Huge cuts could be made in the very slow first half of ""Judas Unchained"" and would improve the book a lot. I spent most of it thinking ""who is this person again?"" since there are so many characters to keep track of that it's impossible to keep them all straight, particularly when you are expected to remember minor characters from the preceding volume."
3,sloggy,"Reading this book is like slogging uphill through jello. It's dense and very slow going. For a book with a lot going on, it's really boring. I never quite find myself with that pressing need to find out what happens next. When I do pick it back up, I find that what happens next wasn't particularly interesting."
3,Drags compared to Hamilton's other novels.,"I've read all of Peter F. Hamilton's novels and liked them, most recently this novel's immediate pre-cursor, Pandora's Star. But this one drags, and has such exhaustive and detailed descriptions of the interstellar societies and great family politics that the science fiction seems almost an afterthought . . . perhaps, at 40, I am still too juvenile to appreciate it, but for my money, give me rockets and monsters and grand space opera, and leave the machinations of the senate to stories dealing with this century. This is the first Hamilton novel I have been unable to finish, I really tried to like it, but after forcing myself through 150 pages of it, I gave up."
5,Gametracker Ceramic Turkey Hunting Plaque,This is an excellent product. I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking to mount their trophy turkey. It looks beautiful when completed and very easy to mount. All around excellent product in every way. I give it 5 stars.
3,"Good ideas, average in development","I thought Gemmell's interpretation of the Arthurian legend was interesting and creative. The characters have the potential to be engaging throughout the series. Unfortunately, I felt that throughout the book he was simply too curt in developing them. With the amount of ground he covered, the book could easily have been 500-700 pages in the hands of a Goodkind or a Lawhead and only would have been more exciting. This weakness changes this book from an epic-level fantasy adventure (which the storyline could have provided) to a nice, weekend read."
1,Bad product item,"Opened the package, inserted batteries, and had problems getting it to light. Finally got it to light. Tried to trim my Standard Poodle's nails, and BINGO...the blade popped out. Reinserted the blade and screw and tried again...BINGO...the blade would not come up, tried again...it cut...and now my Standard Poodle has a splinted frail nail up both sides of the quick and nail. The light is great, when it works, however, the splinted uneven nail is worse than a cut quick. I have not cut a quick or had this uneven splinted nail before. I am returning the product...and use the old faithfuls without the light. Maybe someone will perfect this idea....however...these people have fooled alot of people that care for their pets, making money doing it, and my dog's nail is a mess. Repackaged and shipping back."
4,"Classic disco, Great memories","I purchased this CD soley for the song SOUVENIRS, that everyone from that era would certainly remember. But as i popped it in, i was taken back ""to the day"" with several other great dance-floor-magnets and have enjoyed listening to them over and over."
4,good solid set,very laid back dance music that really hits the spot.good solid arrangements&vibe through out this set.it is cool disco.it still sounds good to this day.check it out.
4,Mainstream Disco - Pure Studio Music,"An amazing Disco Artifact of the seventies, this is classic disco at its best. Today this is background music, or music to listen to while in line skating or working. Very listenable, excellent production, and quite dancilble.My favorite has always been ""Souvenirs"" and I still have the original disco single. They played it to death in MIAMI AT THE DISCO's. ""From East To West"" was their other hitYou will also enjor ""Latin Odyssey"" ""I Love You Dancer"" and ""Let's Get Started""A good, consistant CD, and an excellent example of pure 70's disco. Will sit right next to ""Salsoul Orchestra"" and ""The Silver Convention""."
5,A great place to start building a team,I manage a commission based sales team and have been struggling to get them all working together. I made the mistake of reading the first chapter and thinking I understood everything. We created a Code of Honor that worked for several months but then started to fall apart. That is when I picked up this book again and decided to read it all the way through. It has pointed out my errors and given me great idea's and tools to continue developing the team. It is the best team building book I have read. The concepts are clear and attainable. It does not go into detail about many topics but does cover its Code of Honor concept very well. I also found the book to be a great tool for strengthening personal relationships. I highly recommend it.
5,Must read for business owners and mangers.,"Blair Singer does a great job introducing his Code of Honor philosophy. Additionally, he provides a system for implementation. If you run a business or a sales force this book will be invaluable. It has been a resource to me and my team."
4,Green Is Money,"No one can get into a song like Al Green. On Green Is Blues, his interpretations of songs like ""Get Back"", ""The Letter"", ""My Girl"" and ""Summertime"" strip them to their core and Rev. Green refills them in with his expressive and inventive voice. Other songs like ""One Woman"", ""What Am I Gonna Do With Myself"" and ""Gotta Find A New World"" also show off his magnificent voice."
4,nice lens,Pretty good.What I don't like about is it's tendency to zoom out by itself if pointing downwards.
4,Nice lens,"I've used both Tamron 18-250mm zoom and the the Nikkor 18-200 VR lens. The glass on the Nikkor is perhaps a little better, but not much, whereas the extra 50 mm on the Tamron is noticeable, and nice. In addition, the Tamron has a lock which prevents the lens from sliding out when carrying it -- an important feature if you're carrying your camera around your neck on a backpacking trip, say. It obviously doesn't have the image stabilization features of the Nikkor, but if you're using one of the modern DSLR's that have it built into the body (such as the Pentax K10D), that's less problematic. On the whole, a nice lens: I'd buy it again."
1,Not what I expected!,"The product is not what I expected at all. The material that is made of is not good quality. It's too big , there's a lot of space inside the case and the case itself is uncomfortable to be worn. Sorry, that's the truth. And above all, it's too much for that kind of a case."
3,"Okay, if you don't want carry extra lenses","Nice, really compact though. The lense hood that came with the camera doesn't fit. In addition to the camera, you can carry extra batteries, extra data sticks and a couple of credit cards - that's it.It's attractive and made of sturdy material. I'm happy with it. Fortunately, I have a full size camera bag for those times when I need to bring everything."
5,Fantastic!,"This album has a lot of wonderful songs in it. If you like the typical MT style, then you will love the following songs: SMS To My Heart, Why Does It Feel So Good, and From Coast To Coast. These 3 songs definitely stand out from the rest, and you'll love them! A Must Buy!!!!!"
2,America 2001,I like:Win The Race (Scooter Remix - available on Maxi-CD)03 Maria [ballad in Spanish style]06 Why Does It Feel So Good [optimistic]07 Rain In My Heart [tender ballad]08 Witchqueen Of Eldorado [heya-heya-heya-hoh]11 For A Life Time [ballad]12 From Coast To Coast [true MT style]13 There's Something In The Air [something!]16 Send Me A Letter From Heaven [very good choice for the final track!]I rate this CD ** because the whole album is so Yankee :-((
5,children's library book - entertaining,"Every children's Library should include this book for non-fiction educational reading material. Worthwhile for all ages too, a fantastic read about automobile history and an excellent depiction of how amazing human ingenuity is and how it has changed our world."
5,"A great easy to change All -Through -The - Night - Diaper, and daytime also","These are super thick, which is why I decided to try one at night to see how it would hold up for me. It held up great, (If it can handle my bladder it is a winner for sure!) These are so easy to put on and take off by first securing the belt in the front that is Velcro lined so that the TENA Flex will fit almost any body size. Next, I pull the front part up between my legs and Velcro that to the belt and I'm good to go! (To sleep!)I must say that this was so thick and secure I had no worry before going to sleep. This is one of the few brands that also worked well for me as a nighttime diaper, without me having to add diaper doublers of some sort to see me through until morning. It is nice being able to sleep without the worry of a leak."
3,not the best.,I'd say these aren't the best diaper by tena because I ordered tena slip maxi and I endedup with tena flex in stead. Not what I ordered. Specially since they came from great britian. There nice and bulky. What sure what to expect from tena adult briefs. :)
5,Wailer Fanatics Only,"If you want most of what Bob Bunny and Peter have done together get this, and the other two that JAD claims are the complete collection. Theres always more Bob Marley music to buy right? Yeah there will always be something you aint got, you cant have everything that Bob Marley recorded. This shows how Bob and Peter were molded into international superstars, Bunny is here as well with his amazing voice. Rnb gospel rocksteady reggae nice kick drums too. Buy It cheap folks dont get scammed by these inflated prices on reggae music."
3,Medic Messenger Bags,I've owned many of these Medic Messenger Bags but the quality is so low that lately I just get them at the military surplus stores where they are hefty and stronger.
2,book bag,"You get what you pay for. Kinda flimsy bag, but it was cheap, so I'm not sure I could expect much more than I got."
4,I love it!,I love love this bag! Its small and perfect for carrying small personal items!! It doesn't have any pockets and I did think that it had a cell phone pocket but it doesn't. It's still cute and I really like plus its a knock of the Andrew Christian bag that cost abolut $40 with shipping so I think its a real steal!
5,Back to Back Hits,This is the best introduction to Evelyn's material. This cd comtains all the singles & best album tracks of her four cd's. Perfect for the causal fan.
3,From 1972,"Back cover blurb:Mandy knew how lucky she was to be working in Tunisia as secretary to an eminent archaeologist - and it didn't exactly detract from the glamour of the situation when attractive Ramon al Hassan, young and handsome and the son of an immensely rich oil sheik, proceeded to dance attendance on her - even suggesting marriage. Nevertheless, Mandy was a sensible girl and didn't delude herself into imagining that there was any future in a romance with Ramon, whose life and background was so utterly different from her own. All the same, she was furious when that supercilious Steven Heron refused to be convinced that she knew just what she was doing. Wasn't there a danger that, simply to spite Steven, Mandy would find herself goaded into doing something really foolish?My review:Entertaining novel set in Tunisia, though I thought more of the love rival than the hero, whom I thought was a bit wet. This book's from 1972, therefore no steamy seduction and the last pages end in marriage."
2,"Great show, horrible figure","Being that yes this is an old figure i didnt expect much. Take everything that was wrong with the Xena figures(which are far better and an inch taller) like facial expression and coloring and you have herc figs minus and inch. In one word, this and most of the other htlj are ugly"
4,Catnap does not include sleeping,"This first of the ""Midnight Louie"" series introduces the reader to the world of Las Vegas hoopla through the eyes of a never-say-die, young free-lance PR woman, Temple Barr, and ""Midnight Louie,"" the 20 lb. black cat who decides to adopt a new human. Temple demonstrates a talent for stumbling over dead bodies and, instead of being frightened, must investigate *whodunit.* Midnight Louie does have his say, and demonstrates his feline logic and methods of helping her be at the right place at the right time. Carol Nelson Douglas turns a dandy phrase that's fun to read. This non-fiction addict, and spouse, are now hooked onto Midnight Louie."
4,Fun read,"This got me started on a new-to-me mystery series featuring spunky heroine, Temple Barr, and Midnight Louie, cat detective extraordinaire."
4,Roudbush,"Good product and healthy for your bird.....The only thing is the cost is just way too much. Needs to be lowered but other than that, it is a really good and healthy product."
5,The only bird food you need,"This is the only bird food for my little lovebird, Rosie. We have tried others, and she just flings them out of her dish! It's funny to watch, but a waste of money : Of course, she loves seeds and millet, but those are just for treats. She is almost 8 years old, and is healthy as can be."
2,Book talk,"Win one for Sandra is about a girl Elizabeth who joins a beach volleyball team at her middle school. Elizabeth doesn't like this girl Kimberly because she is snobby and thinks she is the center of attention. She shows of and nobody has the chance to show and shine to impress their coach because Kimberly takes over. Elizabeth decides to throw Sandra the volleyball coach a baby shower. When Elizabeth gets to practice she tells Mandy her great idea about throwing Sandra a baby shower but, Mandy told Elizabeth that Kimberly was already going to have a shower for her.The time to shine was right before the California games and at the game. The girls had everything it took for the games a great coach, great servers, and fast volleys. But they always argued and would need to put everything aside to win the tournament.I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anybody. If you really like volleyball this is inspiring book and really fun to read."
2,"Great look, not so great manufacturing","I had to super-glue two of the black metal frames back onto the plastic base twice since delivery of this product. It looks great in the pictures, but is very flimsy in your hand. It also seems better suited for sitting on a shelf than hanging on a wall."
1,It fell apart,Im not sure how to get in touch with the seller of this item. When I received this item the front frame was messed up I had to glue it back on. That was not that big of a deal but after I gave it to one of my friends as a present they took it out of the box and the stand on the back that holds it up is completely broken off. My brother tried to fix it and its un fixable!!! Also my friends Aunt purchased the same one and it also came broken. Worst money I ever spent!!! The frame is beautiful but now it is un usable due to the back being broken. This is the third one I have heard about from this company being broken!!! I really would like my money back!!!
