1,incorrect description/horrible ipod. :[,the ipod was working fine until two months it began failing internally. it gradually slowed down in response. probably a refurbished piece of crap. now i cant even restore it on itunes. the cosmetic damage was much more than mentioned. and because it just so happened to begon failing after the 30day period i cannot return this waste of money broken ipod. >:[
4,For media lovers and external hardrive owners,"For people like me who have lots of media and want it when and where ever they are, the Ipod Classic 160 Gigabyte is an awesome device. One of the only regrets I have regarding this device is the tendency to break down as i have gone through three. For people who can afford repaired about every one or two years, this is an amazing mp3 player."
5,Great Product,This product was as advertised. It was a great value for the money. It functions just like a brand new one and I would not hesitate to buy from this company again.Why pay for a new one when the reconditioned one from ipodzen is just as good if not better.
2,Avoid - randomly pauses in the middle of songs - no solution from Apple,"The subject summarizes it. We'll be grooving to a song, when all of a sudden the music stops for 2 to 10 seconds. It's very random - it can go 5 straight hours without pausing and then do it on 3 songs in a row. Replay the songs that it skips on, and it works fine. Hundreds of owners of this same model have this problem (do a Google search) and Apple hasn't solved any. They say all hard drive-based MP3 players do it. Well, I've had a hard drive-based Creative for 3 years and a 120 gb Zune for the past 6 months and they NEVER paused in the middle of a song."
4,Good Product,"I bough this ipod after trying other MP3 players, and I have to say it has turned out great. The only problem i found was that in order to charge the ipod you have to connect it to the computer and it doesn't come with a wall charger so I had to buy that separately. And you might want to get a case whether its silicon or hard case to protect the ipod from getting scratched!Good product lots of space to fill with movies, music videos, songs, or pics!!!"
2,Ipod Classic,"Latest firmware upgrade can cause the internal HD to continue running after shut down, which of course runs the battery dead.User interface is slow at best, coverflow is almost unusable.It never ceases to amaze me what Apple gets away with yet is still loved by everyone.Update: if you do NOT use Coverflow to select an album for playback, the battery draining bug will not occur."
2,unusable,"The i pod was unusable. I went to the Apple store to have it checked, and they said it was unusable.I did return the item though and I got my money back with no problems."
2,A Used Ipod 80GB,"For a used Ipod, this one was in fairly good looking condition. However, it wouldn't sync to any library in excess of 150 songs. I took the unit down to my local Apple store, waited in line for about 1 hour and was told that the hard drive was defective. They reformatted for me, but it still wouldn't work. At my expense, I sent the unit back to Coral Reef Electronics. I don't believe this unit was adequately tested by them (there was 1 song on the drive, which is not much of a test), otherwise they would have caught the problem.Although Coral Reef took the unit back (and refunded the purchase amount) without giving me a hard time, I would be very careful what you buy 'used' from them."
5,IPOD,I PURCHASED THIS AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR MY GRANDSON SO I CAN'T GIVE AN HONEST REVIEW OF HOW GOOD OR BAD IT IS; I PURCHASED THE SAME IPOD FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES HERS SO I BELIEVE IT IS PROBABLY WANTED BY THE YOUNG AS WELL AS THE OLD. MARSHA ROPER
5,my buddy,"my ipod goes where ever i go school,work,hanging out. i dont know why some people complaining about it i love the product i think the people complaining about the ipod are probably ms zune fans"
1,New iPod faulty,"I purchased a 160 GB Classic iPod to replace a 30 GB iPod. The old iPod would synch to my music library without a problem. I can't get the new one to synch, I sent it back to Apple and they found no problems. I still can't get it to synch. I think it stinks. My daughter has a 4 giga nano and it has no problems synch music. Needless to say, I am not happy."
2,nightmare error while syncing ipod,"Apple iPod classic 80 GB Black (6th Generation)Delayed Write FailedWindows was unable to save all the data for the file x. The data has been lost. This error may be caused by a failure of your computer hardware or network connection. Please try to save this file elsewhere.""Purchased an ipod like this nightmare trying to copy over music when this error comes upthere seems to be no solutioni spent hours copying my extensive cd collection to itunes along with artworkthen one evemning while updating got message above searched internet extensively for solution but there doesent seem to be one"
2,Menus and navigation are painful,"I guess I'm spoiled by the iPod that is built into my iPhone, but the iPod Classic's interface is not very user friendly.The navigation wheel is difficult to master - I constantly overrun or underrun the menu item that I actually want. It's like, you just want to reach up and touch the screen, but you can't. You have to use this wierd wheel to get the function you want.As an example: It's difficult to access the song repeat function. I turn this feature on and off daily and get frustrated by it each time. On the iPhone, you can get to the repeat function right there on the Now Playing screen. On the iPod Classic you have to go up 2 levels of menu.The iPod Classic is disappointing if you are used to the iPhone or the iTouch."
4,apple ipod 160 GB,I am on the road alot and wanted something that would hold a lot of music and some videos and found it in the 160 i have gone for a few days without even looking at the power level of the unit it is compact fits perfect in my pocket as far overall use i give it four stars at the time of this review i had over fourteen days of music and four or five movies
3,Software Problems,"I must say that I had waited so long for this type of Ipod to be in the market. Saying that, I`m quite dissapointed with Apple. As soon as I made the first sync operation, the Ipod started to reboot automatically without having any chance to interfere in the process. There was no way to reset the Ipod manually and it was not recognize through the USB cable neither through Itunes. After rebooting itself for 10 minutes, it just started working properly and it was recognized through Itunes. I had it to restore it 5 times and it took me 2 software updates to solve this problem. Shame on you Steve Jobs! Greetings From Argentina!"
3,"not as good as people say, but I like it","I was very angry to see that after a week I purchased this, the price dropped like $60, well, it happens, on the other hand I'm happy that I bought it before they stopped making them in apple, and make the 120gb instead(what the hell?, I hate these guys, don't understand why they do that, 160 was fine).I tried transferring my music with itunes, but it was a mess, no cover art, it doesn't recognize folder.jpg as the cover, so in my opinion, it's a crappy program, it takes soooo much ram and for nothing, crashes all the time, well, I could go on forever telling you how much I hate this software.Instead I used Winamp, and it worked perfectly, now I've got 130 gb of completely organized music, all with cover art, it took a bit longer than itunes, but it's definitely worth itLong live winamp, f**k itunes and mac."
1,run do not buy from this seller,the seller never got back to me I even gave my cell number out still hopeing to get my money back. Amazon should ban the seller from the site looks like I am one of many.
2,Shipping...,Don't expect your 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime to arrive in 2-3 days. It's been almost as week and I still haven't received mine. UPS says it's still in transit.
5,Works great,"I purchased this 80GB Ipod over four years ago and I have loaded it with over 15GB of music. I beleive it is a great deal than the Itouch which is more expansivie for less momory. I don't care too much for the other function that the Itouch has as I bought the Ipod just to store and listen to music. So far it is working great with no issues. I know that Apple doesn't make it any more, but they still make the 160GB for a great deal.I recommend this item or 160GB Ipod for those that just want to store and listen to music and don't need all those other function that the more expansive and less memory Itouch offers."
1,doesnt even work,"ipod was broke, worked for a day, now it wont do anything, horrible i hate whoever sent this to me"
2,Glitches too much and have to restore it constantly.,"Whoever sold this to me needs to make sure the products they sell in the future, actually work right. My iPod needs to be restored all the time because it loads too slow and then isn't recognized and tells me to restore it. i am getting fed up with it and will be getting a new iPod soon and will be selling this one. The screen works and the audio works, but I have to restart it four times at least to get my computer to read it, and then it's hit and miss from there. I am not satisfied at all with this, but it will have to do until I can get a new one."
2,defective ipod,It was defective so I took it to the Apple store. They were great and exchanged it for another.
5,Ipod sale price,"I cannot comment on the quality of the Ipod because it is for my daughter's birthday in 2 weeks so has not been opened yet. However, I have a major problem with the price I paid. During the time between when I ordered the Ipod and received it, the price dropped about $45 and I was not given the new price. I am not likely to order from Amazon again."
2,Inconvenienced User,"I works fine. However, I Tunes overloads my RAM whenever the library updates so badly that it locks my computer up. Apple should find a better way to update the library.When I called Apple Tech services they were totally unhelpful with the library update problem. The blamed it on Windows and gave me no solution."
4,Its an iPod,"Well its what I ordered, an 80 gb ipod classic. It came really quick, no problems at all, it was the right spec, the right colour and was well packaged and arrived undamaged."
5,I just love it!,"I'm just enjoying my new iPod Classic (80GB), I love the new design, (flatter and lighter) works perfectly for me; the screen, the games, the sound, everything is just so good! I seriously recomend this awesome device."
4,As advertised,"I've had ipods for a while now and with each upgrade I'm further enamored with the technology. I'm now on my first touch, and it's great. I still use this one for the capacity."
2,C'mon Apple: Where's the BlueTooth for iPod????,"It's disapppointing to me that this latest, greatest, mass storage iPod STILL doesn't have BlueTooth capability--WHY NOT?? WHEN'S IT COMING?? WHAT ARE THEY WAITING FOR: FOR ALL US MASS MARKET DUMMIES TO KEEP SPENDING OUR $$ ON THE WAY TO A BLUETOOTH IPOD?? If anyone in product development @ Apple is reading this, I am formally requesting that you produce this iPod over again w/the BlueTooth feature for wireless music listening. So that's why I'm NOT going to be buying this new 160G iPod--I'll wait 'til they get it right, & save $$ in the process!!"
2,Disapointed,"I have the generation 5 ipod, and just now it completely froze, the buttoms don't work and the computer doesn't recognize it. The same thing happened to my brother and although it was still in warrenty, there was a 38 dollar shipping fee. Ridiculous for something that weighs so little and is STILL under warrenty. He got the ipod back and it still doesn't work. So back off to apple it went. iPods SUCK"
1,iPod,"When I went to the post office to pick up the package, there was nothing in the box. I had waited three weeks for it. Thankfully, I got my money back but then I had to go somewhere else to buy it. I originally wanted to buy it from Amazon because it was $50 cheaper. I'll never do it again."
1,Cheapskates,"What happened to the slip case? For this kind of money, and with all ongoing fuss about scratches to the screen etc., it's unbelievably inconsiderate (not to mention cheap) of Apple not to give you a very basic case to help protect it from wear and tear."
1,the box was empty,"I bought an Apple 80Gb ipod classic silver 6th generation. The package was delivered on Miami by DHL. When the package was received at the Warehouse (December 6), the box was empty."
1,"Damaged. Don't order from ""Egears""","Received item and only 117 songs would sync to the ipod. I have 2 other ipods and never had this problem before, I just wanted the larger size because I was travelling. Contacted the seller when I received item but was unable to return before my trip abroad. Contacted seller when I returned and they will not let me return, even though I notified them of the problem initially. Poor customer service."
5,I finally bit the bullet!,"I have been wanting an iPod for a while now, but was hesitant because of the cost. I finally bit the bullet and it is wonderful! I highly recommend the classic for first time buyers because it has everything you need in an easy to use interface. I have a long commute to and from work and primarily use my classic for audiobooks and podcasts. And let me tell you, at 80GB, it will be years before I fill it up and have to worry about removing anything! And using it in this fashion, a charge will last most of the week, although when the kids use it for videos the battery drains faster.Definitely a must buy."
2,"Q: Bigger hard drive, but at what cost? A: No ipod camera connector","I'd only get this if you must have 160gb. This has several disadvantages when compared to the earlier 5.5 gen ipod:The ipod camera connector is not compatible.Navigation is slow and clunky, even when not using cover flow. Makes the click wheel feel unresponsive.I'm using version 1.0.2 of the firmware"
2,2 stars untill they can fix all the bugs.,"let me keep this as short as possible.The ipod classic is seriously flawed.Even after the first software update, that made the slow click-wheel more responsive,its still frustrating to operate.The biggest annoyance is the frequent crashing.Mine freezes/crashes daily!!!i've never had to reset an ipod so many times before(this is my third ipod).My primary reason for getting the 160 gig, was so i could store most of my music in a loseless format.I cant belive apple put this product out, with so many pimples and warts."
3,Good and Bad,"Ok The Ipod Classic's are a step forward and a step back. First Apple purposely disabled the video out feature unless you use their cables. This is all for more Dollars which for how much these things cost and the money they make off them is just ridiculous. I have had several problems with this new Ipod from syncing errors to general data issue's I bought one of the first released so I believe it had to do with that since I got that unit replaced it has been fine. The Cover Flow is neat I don't know why people complain about it if you don't like it don't use it. So the good with the new Ipod models would have to be the space and then the cover flow feature which I like. The Negative points are as always - apple, their customer service, and the disabling of the video out for third party devices - just underhanded. It is still a great device so if you are not to upset about having to spend 50 dollars on cables than it will be a good bet for you."
5,"Worth every penny, cover flow is just a minor flaw.",The iPod is amazaing especially for people with huge music collections like me. But everyone keeps putting it down because the coverflow is a litte slow at loading the album art. Can you blame it? If you have 50 albums on the iPod do you think it can just load them up effortlessly? It's the same way on the iTunes menu on the computer. If you let the cover flows 2 second load up time get in the way of you enjoying your iPod then you have missed the point.
2,Music Great.... Video lets hope for a update,I have had the Classic now for 4 days. The interface is much better than Gen 5 but the Classic is slower. All and all for for Music and watching video on the iPod its self the Classic wins.The bad.Most of all the iPods docs and ALL Of the past iPod cables do not work with any of the new iPods. Apple change the computability so that you have to buy new cables and docs. They say it is because the old ones put to much drain on the battery(whatever I have had no issue). So if you are not upgrading from a previous iPod it may not be an issue because you will have to buy the $50.00 cable any way but if you already have all your iPod accessories you may want to keep the iPod you have until they fix this issue.By the way if your car radio has a adapter for a iPod. Like the Pioneer D3 I just bought. You guessed it none of the new iPods will work.
5,iPod has come a long way,"I didn't want to upgrade from my ancient iPod, but a hardware failure gave me no choice. I have been delighted with my replacement, however. The 6G 80 GB iPod classic is a very elegant unit. Lovely screen. But the biggest plus is battery life. An amazing increase over my previous player. I have hundreds of songs, symphonies, operas, and all the Harry Potter books rattling around in about 1/4 of the classic's memory. Don't know how I'm going to fill up the rest. Bought an FM transmitter for the iPod when the CD player in my car jammed. Don't miss the CD unit at all now."
1,don't buy the 6th gen ipods...read why,"Apple is pulling a clasiic Microsoft tactic here by making the 6th gen ipods NOT backward compatible for no apparent reason other than to force you to pay more to upgrade your OS and docking stations / cables. Plus, the 5.5 gen is faster, and better assembled. From what I am reading here, alot of others are saying the same thing.Don't buy this item. Buy a 5.5 gen instead."
1,What went wrong???,"I have a 40GB iPod Classic. It's a breeze to use, an excellent product, and I love it. It's full, so I wanted to upgrade to the 160GB. What a disaster! Apple was in a hurry to get this one out. It shipped with a bad software version, so the first thing you're stuck with is updating the software, but there's a glitch: You can't download the new software without jumping through a bunch of hoops to disable firewalls and other stuff on your computer. That required a lengthy tech call. After downloading the software, I tried to sync it up. It would load a few MB and then freeze. Several more tech calls and hours of wasted time (including reimporting my library and reformatting the iPod)and it still kept freezing. Bottom line: This piece of junk doesn't work with its own software and is nothing but a headache. Apple should be ashamed. They had a corner on the market and a reputation for excellence, and they blew it. Keep your money until they remove their heads from their posteriors."
1,Thought it was Great...,"I first purchased this item about a year ago for a Christmas present. It worked great for the first couple of months and then it would randomely turn off when it still had full battery! I thought that I could deal with that but it kept doing it more often, and then a few days ago it just shut off. It had half a battery still, and it won't turn on or even charge. It's competely busted! Blank screen and skrewed up. I saved my money for a long time to buy it and now I probably can't even get a refund :(. A waste of money and I'm left with nothing."
4,the legendary iPOD,"At last i have the legendary iPod from apple throught the legendary site Amazon, with 17 $ i have it on the next day , i will purchase products form amazon as i trust its quality , i thinknext time i will get my new laptop from here.i pod is great but it is little bit heavy ."
1,i have one advise about buying this item....DON'T,"Didn't learn from the Classic ipod 60, and bought this one...was setting on a chair, and dropped it, so it started going crazy and when i went to fix it, they told me I'll have to spend 2/3 of its price, as thr hard disk was shattered!!!I don't know what type of a device shatters when you drop it from a 30 cm on a carpet...but this is your ipod...never gonna buy an ipod again"
2,not all that,Apple iPod classic 80 GB Black (6th Generation)I had been waiting to buy this item but when i recieved it i found it almost impossable to put in my existing large mp3 library as a result i have less than 10% of my music on it when i try to get more i keep getting referred to the apple i store.... what a waste of my money
1,Not quite good enough.,I did a lot of research on MP3 players. The Ipod kept coming up at the top of the list. I wanted a player that I could listent to audiobooks on. I really thought I had purchase the right tool for this. I have heard for years that APPLE is super user friendly. It sure isn't in this case. I am very unhappy with this player. I wanted a player that I could listen to audio books on. Yes you can do this on this player but you can't or at least I haven't figured out how to load a book into a single folder. I have lots of audio books that I would love to put on this thing under their own name. The way it does it now is it list maybe 25 different disk. What a pain. Maybe I need to find a 15 year old to help me load this thing up. Apple sure doesn't have clear instruction on how to do it.
2,defective,"the ipod is defective, doesn't play songs completely through. i am very unhappy. have spent many hours on the phone with apple to try to fix problem, even sent in the product, however they are unable to repair it. i spent way too much money to have a defective piece of equipment."
5,Best MP3 player available,"I've tried all the competitors first, I've had a Sansa Connect, Sansa E260, Microsoft Zune, Sirius Stiletto. While all are pretty good at some things, the ipod is just the best all around mp3 player available. Easy to use and navigate and has all the essential features, EQ, sleep timer, cover art, pictures, videos, games, easy podcast management. Plus the iTunes Store has pretty much everything imaginable, although some of the stuff you can get a little bit cheaper on Amazon's MP3 store.If you're looking for an MP3 player, you can't go wrong with the ipod. Easy to use for everyone, not just technophiles. I even got one for my 60 year old dad as he travels a lot, and he loves it.Also, the ipod has the largest support from 3rd party accessory makes for things like cases and even in-car listening options and integrated head units."
2,iPod connector,"This iPod is similar to my old iPod (60 GB), but there is a one point that really disappointed me: it is impossible to use the earphone-connector (above the iPod) to watch videos on tv. I have a good cable to put the iPod on tv and now I can't use it anymore. You have to buy a special cable with doc-connnector to plug the iPod on tv. I don't know why Apple did this change."
5,just what my daughter wanted for Christmas,It's what every adolescent and young adult wants to play and store their music. Works like a champ.
4,A couple more features would be perfect,"It works very well. Sounds fine, and boots very quickly. Here are the things which could be better:You cannot control how files are stored and access them by that organization. I am used to using that on my computer, squeezebox, and old iriver, and find it very useful there.You cannot put rockbox on it. This seems to be because apple doesn't want you to, so they thwart it. Too bad, since it would cure the first problem.The quick start instructions could be clearer on operating the touch wheel (just touching for ""dialing"" vs. actually pushing it). I had a lot of trouble until my daughter set me straight on that."
4,very easy to used,"very easy to used and have long time battery i recommended, have a lot space.you can take any where in your packet,thanks."
4,Very good condition,product was in good condition and was delivery in an expected time....meaning came way before i was expecting it!! Thanks!
5,Awesome!,"I just purchased the 160GB model iPod Classic. I have no idea how I got along without this thing. Music, audio books, videos, movies, photos, etc. And the range of items for it is great - that is what finally swayed me from buying the Zune.A must have for today's world. Just don't go broke on iTunes with all that is available there..."
2,lousy sound,"obviously having just about all of your music in one little gadget is a beautiful thing. the sound of the music in said gadget is border line atrocious. lack of bass and trebly sound make for a disappointing listening experience when compared to my cd player. reducing the treble does help a little but the oomph is still missing. boosting the bass on the ipod unfortunately distorts the sound.if anybody has suggestions to improve the sound ,please let me know"
3,160gb blues,"likes to stick, guess 160 gb does that to a machine, plus went on sale the day i recieved it in the mail due to the new 120 gb:("
5,My Toy,"I've always liked electronic products and I've always been up-to-date with this type of products. I had the first iPod in my hands in 2003, I was living in Spain and a Friend came visit us from Venezuela, he had something similar to the one I have, and he had a cordless transmiter to use it with empty radio broadcasts in order to listen to it on the car, it was almost 5 years ago and since that day I wanted to purchase it, but theres was always something first. I know now that there are so many newer versions but I just want to listen to all my discography, with a good sound and in on small peace, I'm sure it will be MY Toy for a very long time until I get my iPhone. I've complemented it with a Bose stereo system for iPod, it is perfect, I also purchase the transmiter to listen to it in my car, it hasn't arrived jet. I'll let you know.A.H."
5,Appy ipod Classic is easy to use,I have loved this model. It is so easy to use and that is coming from a non techy person. It has tones of space and is nice weight and easy to slip in a back pocket while working around the house. I have put books on cd on to this and it has been great to listen to my favorite stories while being able to move about and not be tied to my cd player. It has a clear screen and the buttons work with just a light touch. Extellent product.
1,why?,I was looking into this and I realized that they are charging more for this 80gb than Apple charges for a brand new 160gb one. why?
2,"Started off great, then battery fail","Received this product within days of ordering. At first, it was working great. Lasted a month or so with no problems, and then since then has had battery issues. You could charge it all day and once you unplug it, the battery lasts maybe 20 mins. Incredibly annoying and frustrating."
3,It works!,"I bought this iPod feeling a little sketched out that it had been used. I got the package within the week, even though I had picked the shipping that could take up to a month. It was in pretty good shape and had no problems putting music on it. I was not made aware that the ""hold"" button on top didn't work... so that's mildly disappointing. Overall, it was a positive experience."
4,Very good product.,"What it says, it does perfectly. However new UI is better except for the menu screen. It could have merged with backgroud to give better outlook than dividng screen in half."
3,Ipod 80,"Really nice, although it seems about 10 times heavier than the next smaller size down even though its not really that much better (just holds more songs)"
4,good!,"I like my ipod. I have only had it a few weeks, but it is great. I have had trouble down loading my audio books, and I got a little confused using iTunes, and I don't like that the manuals are all online.It has a lot of memory, good sound, and its physically -plenty small."
2,Not up to snuff,"I don't really like this new iPod for the following reasons:1. slow to load and find items.2. doesn't update, intall or sync error free; I'm still trying to sort this out (yet my old iPod was flawless)3. the split screen with moving album art is both annoying and distracting with no way of turning it off.Hope you have better luck than I..."
2,Thanks Mr. Jobs,"It lasted 3 months. I've NEVER dropped it. It doesn't have any viruses. My computer has no viruses. I've restored it 20 times and it wont add or delete new songs. The apple people won't listen to me because i don't have a warranty. After reading many forums about my problem, every thread ends with people telling the OP he needs to buy a new ipod. I'm not inexperienced with computers so I know what I'm talking about when i say that I've tried everything. I should have bought a Zune.UPDATE:Hey guys, got an update.I drove 2 hours to an Apple store and they replaced my iPod that day for free.So, I don't know if that works for everyone. The people working there were very nice.I still think the ipods are buggy, but if the personal service is this good everywhere, then maybe it's worth it."
3,iPod 80 GB Classic,"I have had a lot of problems with synchronization and my computer recognizing the device. I run Windows XP with all the updates. I have applied all the ""patches"" and I have the latest software from itunes. The iPod works well. In retrospect, I wish I bought a different product. Apple has a monopoly on the music and in my opinion does not care about my problems. After reading the reviews and recommendations from Apple, I was afraid of loading iTunes on my Vista-running computer. After reading horror stories on the web, I would wait till Apple and Microsoft certify that iTunes works with Vista"
3,Good product,I can't wait untill apple can make this kind of ipod on Nano size but with at least 30 GB
1,Shipping warning,ipod was not properly packaged in shipping box to prevent possible damage. THIS IS NOT A BOOK! I returned the ipod without even inspecting it do to the lack of care in packaging. BUYERS BEWARE.
2,Disappointed,"I am so upset with this product. I don't own it yet but since I got my 30G ipod video stolen last week, I thought I'd check out if it was still in stock and purchase another... SHOCK!!! OF course APPLE has to produce a brand new ipod! I mean seriously, the disappointment grows each day when I find that new designs are coming out (this one not to my liking). I'm not a big fan of this aluminum casing either... I prefer the smudging cover of the ipod video. And the colors... The Black one looks so dull it looks like a fake casing or something that sells as the fake ipod... Silver looks nice on the NANO, but White looks better on the Ipod video... Bring back the ipod video design!!!"
4,Storage and battery,"I have a rather large music collection. At least, compared to the average Joe/Joanne. Nearing around 180GBs, it's good to finally see a product that can handle most of my collection. Personally, I dislike Apple. I don't like Macs, I don't like iPods, I don't like iTunes, and I really can't think of anything about them that I do enjoy. However, at 160GBs and a 40 hour battery, I think I am more than willing to take the plunge and buy one of these as soon as I get the finances to justify it."
1,not able to pop in a battery,"I have NEVER understood the hype about ipods... GREATEST DISADVANTAGE, YOU CANNOT PUT IN ANOTHER BATTERY, when it's empty. Should be possible to switch a battery as easy as it is with a cellphone and a a digital camera.You're on a holiday trip, or at the beach, and halfway, you run out of power... LAUGHABLE.and when the battery is dead in 3 or 4 years time, you can send it off to an apple center to have another one put in for 60 dollar. PLUS shipping costs...My idea about this is that all people who are soooo drawn into the ipod hype have lost their brain."
3,Not for Audio-Books,"I returned the Zoon (horrible software), within a week, and replaced it with iPod 80 Gb. Well, I didn't realize until too late, that iPod is an iTunes-pay-per-Song-Delivery-Device. In other words it is not a personal recorder where you can download your legally owned stuff. It scrambles the tracks. This may not be an issue for music tracks, but for audio-books it is a disaster. As a matter of fact, unless you want to listen to music only, from iTunes (pay again for music), this device is a Frustration-Device."
1,0 star rating for this one,"Like everyone else I never received the product, never got responses to my numerous emails and I have filed a claim. Come on Amazon, do something about people like this who are obvious scammers. Amazon really needs to screen its third party sellers better or just do away with them all together."
2,"overpriced, apple monopoly","Bought this for my daughter for x-mas. My wife and two daughters each have one, they all had to replace their old players within a year or two. Personally I don't use Itunes or an Ipod. The Ipod wheel is cool and all but for less money you can get better and more versatile products (love my Sandisk mp3 player).Check out Appian's ""Replay Music"" software - w/ windows XP it'll record anything you hear on your PC and . . . it even names the song for you."
1,iPod classic has big problem with tv out function,"The new iPod classic has a big problem for all users of the photo and video functions. You cannot display photos, videos or video podcasts on your TV screen, as you cannot change the TV out function on the iPod from OUT to ON. If you want to see your videos fromthe iPod on the TV screen, then do not buy the iPod classic until Apple has fixed this problem."
1,Horrible,This didn't work at all. Didn't even turn on. I am returning it and will not be purchasing any more electronics from this website.
5,AWESOME!!!!,My old 2nd generation Nano broke and I took a chance and bought this product. I absolutely love it! 5 stars all the way. I bought this item when it was on sale $214 but it is so nice I would've bought it even at the current price of $250.
1,Ipod Classic is junk,I bought the IPOD classic and had to return the first and second one for the same reason. The wheel doesn't want to move smoothly. The more I read about these online the more I see that its a design flaw. Amazons Customer service was first rate.
4,Impressed so far,"Bought the 80G to replace the old trusty 30G I've had for years. Alas the trusty 30G didn't fare so well after dropping in on my concrete driveway. So far (two days) the 80G has worked like a charm. I am most impressed with how easy it was to load with all my tunes (~3,500) and pics (~900). I simply hooked it up and walked away for an hour. Thinner, lighter, and larger screen than the 30G. This is a nice product and I find most of the complaints (e.g., split cover screen and its speed) to be trivial."
4,"Decent, but annoying click","I had the old iPod classic video, which I actually like better than the new one (80 GB). I only got it to replace one that was stolen, and wish I would not have ""upgraded.""I don't like that the screen is cut in half by cover art and song description. And if you don't have cover album art, it shows music notes instead.I like the full screen view on the old 30 GB model. I'm hoping there is a way to turn off the split screen and have just the regular view. I haven't found a way to do that yet.Also, when you are playing music and go through the menu to select a new song or just navigate through, you can hear every ""click"" magnified through your speakers or headphones. That is REALLY annoying. I want to be able to find another song without hearing myself searching for it!The other features are standard, excellent iPod features, but I still like the old 30 GB model much better."
1,iPod showed up inoperable.,"This is a wonderful product, however I bought it refurbished from the vender, and it showed up incapable of communicating with my mac. I am currently working on the problem, but it appears somewhat grave because I've been through all the general troubleshooting on the Apple website, to no avail. The bottom line is that a I received a busted version of a great product from a second-hand dealer."
3,"""Refurbished""","While the iPod did what I needed (saving my 22 gig library from a dying computer), I expected that a piece describe as ""refurbished"" would have a functional battery. This one lasts less than 48 hours when it is not in use. I haven't tried trying to use it as a portable music playing device, but it does serve as a functional disk drive. Price was right. 3 stars."
5,Very Happy!,I was very happy when I received my Ipod Classic. The Ipod was in great condition and worked perfectly! I use it every day and I am very pleased with it!! It arrived earlier than expected too which was a very nice surprise :)
4,Has been great,"I wish I could have a normal and supported way to get the music back to my hard disk, but the iPod efficiency has been outstanding. Battery lasts long enough and the space is good as well."
4,Yet another Ipod with only minor upgrades...,"With the price point of this latest version of the 5th gen Ipod they should have phased out completely the 30, 60, and 80 GB versions. Anyone still holding an Ipod Mini still thinks there isn't enough of a reason to upgrade. Yay, a color screen and you can watch videos on the gloriously tiny screen. Yes it is viewable enough but still more of a novelty. A serious upgrade would have been the new Ipod Touch with a 160GB drive instead of a still meager amount of flash for video storage. And anyone worried about dropping something they just paid so much for should have bought an armband or belt setup for it. IMHO wait just a little longer and the latest cow will come out of Steve Job's brain barn. Hopefully generation 6 will be something to wow us all again and rally clan Ipod. I give this product four out of five stars only because the fifth generation Ipod is still (again IMHO) the best MP3/music player out there."
2,"pretty package, disappointing software","The other negative/mediocre reviews have already pretty much said it. Itunes is buggy, and Apple is trying harder then ever to force people to use it. The new UI and click wheel are kind of clunky, although they look pretty. Sound and picture quality are fine, but there are other players out there that are just as good without the annoyances that come with the new Ipods. I traded mine in for one of the new creative zen players, and haven't regretted it."
4,Apple 80 GB iPod,"So far so good. Haven't had any problems. My only complaint is learning how to use it. Instructions are online. Luckily, I have lots of young friends who know everything!"
4,Nice,I am really enjoying this product the only flaw that I think that it has would be that the click wheel is a little jumpy. I am getting better about using it but I used a friends 30 GB 5.5gen. and his click wheel worked amazingly. But other than that it's awesome for watching videos and I really liked the down loadable games that the i tunes store had available for the device. I was also impressed by the battery life. The cover flow is also really cool. The perfect i pod for people with a lot of music and videos.
1,Piece of iGarbage,"Like many of the reviewers, iFind this product to be iNother piece of Steve Jobs' garbage. Apple sucks when it comes to making hardware (and software for that matter). This particular, silver/white piece of iGarbage iFroze after iFew months and could not be restored. It is the second iPod (over 80 gigs) that has done that to me. iHave now learned my lesson to NOT buy Apple hardware garbage anymore.iTunes is decent enough, iSuppose --- but iRecommend downloading music from [...] (88 cents per download) or Amazon.com and getting iBetter piece of hardware (not Apple).Remember: don't believe the iPe. Apple sucks."
4,It's actually 150 GB,Last year's 80 GB was the same price as this now and there's (almost) double the music. The cover display feature is over-blown but you will become obsessed with filling this tiny machine with music for months and months!!!!
1,Outdated and horrid quality.,"I was listening to my cousin Bike's iPod and was shocked by the horrible quality! It sounds like a scratchy record! I think my 1999 portable CD player is better than this junk, and I don't need to spend all the time uploading it onto my computer! Stick with the classics, folks, they're better."
3,160Gb Ipod Classic,"I purchased the iPod to replace the current mp3 player i have, a Creative Zen. The Ipod has a lot of nice features like games (which i never play), clock, calendar, etc. It's like a Mac PC but it only plays music. It sound nice through the earphones but I was very disappointed with the sound quality through my mini speakers and car stereo. I received a day ago and is now planning on selling it. $370. What a waste...!?!?"
4,I like it!,"I like this ipod but it could come with a cover so not to make a nother purchase to get a leather cover. Also I have problems with iTunes software, it's not handy!!"
1,Very unreliable...,"I am on my 3rd ipod video in 8 months. Apple, though it claims to offer a year's protection, really only offers two months (look at their web site for the details...the devil is in the details).It's nice, when it works. Too bad it doesn't work nearly often enough. It is a lot of money to put towards a product that has clear design flaws.In the future I'll be looking at more affordable mp3 players."
5,Ipod,"The new Ipod Classic is something else! very comfortable and great distribution of the images of the screen.. Great new look, highly recommended."
2,Ipod classic SUCKS in its response times,Apple iPod classic 160 GB Silver (6th Generation)I earlier had a ipod 4g Mini marketed by HP.Which exactly got frozen at the end of the warranty period. and had no waysto get it serviced.Latter i got a 5G ipod. 30 Gb which was excellent.Now i got a 160 Gb 6G ipod classic 5 months back.This ipod totally SUCKS.The ui is as sluggish as a sloth bear. Also the response when connected to a computer is still pathetic.The performance of the Ipod classic is definitelydegraded to the earth. compared to its predecessors.I would recommend not to buy this as an ipod instead if you wish to have aexternal hard disk go for it.
4,My first IPOd,"This little sucker does everything from music to movies. Hook it up to ITunes and download podcases, audiobooks, etc. I compared prices everywhere but Apple holds the price pretty firm."
3,5th Generation was Better,"I was happier with the previous Ipod Video, worked much better, faster. This new one has a more slick interface, but it has a lot of flaws, the coverflow is very slow compared to the itouch, the songs images shows when the ipod feels like showing them. And the whole performance is slower.I still like the ipod but instead of improving, it feels like it works worse. Maybe this will be solved with an update or something."
5,Catalogued Music Library,"I recently purchased my 160G IPOD and I'm elated with my purchase. As a traveling musician, it is so convenient to have my music library with me at all times. Waiting in airports and enduring long flights seem less exhausting with my trusty little IPOD. It could be more video friendly, though."
5,Excellent buy,"Good quality sound, excellent memory for storage of songs, excellent buy, and prompt shipment. Thanks!"
4,Good people,Great time in shipping but the battery in the iPod is very bad have to charge it daily. But other than that great
3,Good but not Great (yet),"I have a 5.5 Generation 80G and I got a 80G classic, so I quite literally did a side by side comparison. True, the new interface is lovely, the screen is a touch brighter and its a thiner design, but even after the update from Apple, the spin up time on the interface is just so slow. Its especially horrible going to a listing of movies, it once took nearly 2 min for all my movies to display. The classic is sluggish and for me that is a bit of a deal breaker. I'm a huuuge Apple fan, I have 3 ipods (iPod mini 1st generation, Shuffle 2nd generation and my 5.5 generation 80G), a Mac Mini and will be shelling out for a Mac book pro next month when Leopard comes out, but this one is going back. I have a feeling the next generation Classic may be the one to watch for but for now its all Style and not enough substance, if your going for a ipod video get the 5th generation while you still can or wait until Apple has a chance to get rid of the glitches in this one."
1,Freezes with iTunes,"I just returned the one I bought yesterday. There's a problem with the interface with iTunes and it ends up using 100% of your cpu capacity over and over again. It took me 20 minutes just to make a 10-song playlist!! According to the support guy I spoke with on the phone, Apple is aware of this problem, but is not talking about it. The salespeople claim to know nothing, but were very quick to give me a full refund without a restocking fee. I've seen threads on several forums online discussing the issue -- it appears to be fairly widespread. Anyways, my three-year-old iPod conked out on me, so I don't have time to wait around for Apple to fix a problem they won't even publicly acknowledge. I bought an 80gb 5th generation enhanced - a little more expensive, but I know it works, as my partner has one."
5,Very happy with mine,"I've had a LOT of iPods and other media players. I still have a nano 2g for the gym and skiing, but this iPod holds my whole music library, sounds great and is small enough to be easy to carry around.The battery life is great, sound is awesome and video isn't bad though I'd never try to watch a full length movie on a screen this small.I considered an iTouch, but I think the novelty will wear off and I'll have a 16GB music player, larger than my nano, a $399 price tag and no ability to control things like volume or song forwarding without taking it out and looking at it to run the touch screen."
3,Buggy like most Apple technology,I bought the ipod classic after reading all the great reveiws online.. My gut was to go with a zune but i listened to the reveiws.. and i wasnt impressed the first day i got the thing it froze up on me and i brought it in twice because it froze up i finally returned it for a zune and i love my zune.
1,"Incompatible with Mac OS 10.3, when update is not a sensible choice","First, the iPod itself is a lovely piece of equipment, the functionality I was looking for in a pretty package, at an acceptable price. It could be a nice replacement for the old iPod that I wore out.But (as of late September 07), buyer beware: it does not work with Mac OS 10.3. Granted, that is not the latest OS, but a reasonable version to run on a home machine. And, updating the OS at the time the iPod Classic is released is not a sensible option, given that 10.5 will be available very soon.Apple could have done better than that - leaving their loyal, long-time customers hanging like that is a terrible business strategy. A 1-star rating not strictly for the product itself, but for the overall experience. (And one would think they would have learned from the iPhone debacle.)So, loyal Apple users with OS 10.3 - it is a wise choice to wait until OS 10.5 is out."
2,highly dissatisfied,"I need a refund asap please. This is the first time that I have been completely dissatisfied with a purchase from Amazon. The 80 gb ipod came in today. I attempted to download my music library of about 6,000 songs but it wouldn't down load all of the music except for 90 of them. I went back online to see about this items reviews and a comment was made that nothing was wrong with the ipod and that it was the customers computer that was acting up. Well in this case I know its not my laptop. The ipod is clearly dysfunctional, so you should really take it off the market. Stating that it is in good working condition is false. The ipod also makes funny noises, so I returned it in less then two hours. I sent it priority so you should have it back in your hands by Saturday. As for me, I want my back. If you need further information, you can contact me."
1,poor,I would love to put in a review for the product I purchased if I would have recieved it but I never did. I'm still waiting for my money back.
1,major problems with thumbwheel,"I strongly urge anyone considering this product to do a test-drive first. Apple has redesigned the thumbwheel and it just doesn't work properly. Its virtually impossible to stop on the desired album or track. Also, the album art is a disaster - images don't load timely and as they do, it causes the flow to freeze and then release 10 albums away from where you were trying to get to. The Nano doesn't have this delay issue, so it must be related to the hard-drive slower access times. But both the classic and nano both have the same redesigned thumbwheel that is very hard to control. I was completely frastrated with my experience. I'm not going to recommend another product, just don't buy this or the redesigned Nano."
1,CONSUMER ALERT,"I purchased this item last week to upgrade my ipod 80gb (great item!!!).I found the sound on the classic VASTLY INFERIOR to the old ipod. I thought it might have been my imagination but after cruising some websites, I discovered that APPLE is using another chip that deteriorates the sound in significant way. I found the sound of the Classic to be thin and shrill compared to the older one and not nearly as warm and ""clean."" (I mostly listen to Jazz and classical) Again, I thought this might be my imagination but apparently other purchasers have had a similar experience. I'll be returning mine."
2,User interface is slow!,"After trying several units at different Apple stores, all of the new iPod Classics suffer from a slow interface. Apple added Cover Flow and additional graphics but apparently underpowered the device and menu items have a noticable delay, Cover Flow is slow to refresh and even the clickwheel navigation is sluggish. These problems are not shared by the new Nano, which operates beautifully. I wanted to buy the classic, but now will go with either a Nano or a Touch."
4,80 GB I-POD,"It looks good, it got here fast, and it holds a ton of songs. Has a glitch or two that happens while running, or once when I was downloading music. Other than that it works great!!!"
5,happy with the purchase.,this product lived to my expectations. I looked at 'nano's but i would say the 'classic' with its size for the given price is the most economical buy!
3,Overrated,"ipod has a handle on the market, but are overrated. They aren't compatible with many formats. Watch out if you've ripped your cd collection in your windows media player, this thing won't play the ""wma"" format. Sending media thru itunes is a pain, although the site itself has bunch a massive collection to download at $.99.Seriously, get a second generation ZUNE if you have a PC. It plays most formats (even the itunes files that you bought, has a bigger screen, fm tuner, wireless syncing and shareing between ZUNES (like if you friend has a photo or song they can send it to your ZUNE), you can upload from your ZUNE to your PC, you can choose the download format when you buy tracks for $.79, or you can subscribe for $14.99 a month and fill it with as many songs or albums you want and listen as many times as you want until you decide you must own it. All around the ZUNE is a better and more compatible product.Zune 80 GB Digital Media Player, Red (2nd Generation)"
3,Bastante Bueno,"Buen producto, buena compra, suficiente espacio de almacenaje, pero pienso que en poco tiempo ya caduca, de igual forma me compre un Itouch y no tienen comparación."
5,Love it!,"My husband surprised me with this Ipod for my birthday. It's my first one and I'm really happy with it. The sound quality is amazing, and you get all the features an Ipod can offer you such as video, pictures, music, etc. After using it every day for five months I haven't had any problem with it, it works perfectly. I really love this product."
5,Awesome Ipod. Glad I picked this over ITouch,"I have had several Ipods and was debating whether to upgrade to an ITouch or just get a Classic. I am glad I picked Classic. This is definitely a big improvement from the 5th generation. Love it, love it, love it. Love the space and transfer is lightning fast. Much much better. If ITouch comes in 80GB, I would probably get it. But its new technologies do not make it as good a PDA as a Palm TX, unfortunately (I'm talking about professional software, not pretty but empty applications). My old cable doesn't work with this new Classic. But no biggie, it comes with its own cable anyway. Too bad it doesn't come with earbud covers and a soft cover. Still, everything else has improved.. contacts, alarm, calendar, etc... things that I don't care about. But nice to have them improved. I might actually get to use them. Five+ stars!"
5,I LOVE My iPod!,"I am a huge music fan and I now don't know what I would do without my iPod. I purchased this one to replace my old 20 GB because it soon became too small to hold all of my music. I was disappointed at first with the lack of ""cool"" accessories that were available for the Classic, that has since improved. With this iPod I am able to add videos and pictures too. I currently have over 6,000 songs, 4 movies and 200 pictures on my iPod and it's not close to being half full! I have noticed that with adding the album pictures, it seems a little sluggish on the display for a few seconds (doesn't affect the music playing). Overall, I LOVE my iPod and now I do have a FM TransmitterXtremeMac IPV-APV-00 AirPlay Boost FM Transmitter for iPod Video (White)to use with it but I wish there was a better option for a transmitter."
4,High Capacity...but Slow,"I purchased the 160GB iPod Classic to replace a 5th generation 60GB iPod with Video.I wanted the large capacity.It works as described; however, the 160GB drive used is very, very slow. If all you're doing is listening to music or watching videos, it's OK. However, playing games, like Mini-Golf, is painful. I owned Mini-Golf on my previous iPod and really liked it. On this iPod, the game is constantly pausing, waiting for information from the hard drive.I also can't help but wonder if Apple reduced whatever RAM is inside the 160GB iPod. That would explain the constant pausing while info from the hard drive is downloaded.Summary: Music & video are fine...everything else is slow and slower.By the way, I knew about Coverflow before purchasing this iPod. I hate it. I wish there were a way to disable it while the iPod is using the main menu. I've disabled it in every place I can."
4,Some improvements but still I like 5.5 better,"The best thing is the front is scratch proof.. but the back remains the same. The interface has changed which includes a cover flow, which I don't find too useful in ipod classic ( ipod touch it is great). The click wheel has become a bit smaller (i feel). The ipod is definitely thinner. But I do hope apple can look and provide a radio with an ipod."
5,Great Gift!,"I gave my son this ipod for christmas and he was overjoyed. We have both had fun learning how to make this work. It took some doing, although I like to try without reading directions! Silly me. We figured it out and he now has a bunch of songs to listen to."
1,I'm sure I'd like it if not for the bugs in Itunes 7.x,"Well, I've never bought an Ipod, having held off for years. With the lower price on the classics, I jumped in.Boy am I sorry. I've had it a week, and can't do a thing with it. The itunes software is buggy and deleted all my songs (after getting them on their easily on an older version, which it made me update). Now,itunes tells me it can't write to my device and continually tells me to reset it (which does nothing). Look on apples support site and you see hundreds of people screeming in the forums about this problem, with no response from Apple anywhere... not even acceptance a problem exists and a 'we are working on it'.These things are supposed to be easy to use... that is the main advantage of Ipod on itunes, right??? Well, I'm about ready to return this one. Buggy software and non responsive support is not the way to 'lead the industry'."
4,A happy new IPOD user,"Easy to use and looks good. The cover flow is a nice feature, and I find with 15 or so CDs imported (since getting it a few days back) it works speedily i.e. no delay in the artwork appearing. I have a silicon cover and this has a thin film covering the click wheel. It works well. The clarity of video playback is great.I find the equalizer is best off (not one EQ setting seems to enhance the sound in the way I like), but apart from that it seems a wonderfully designed music player. I give 4 rather than 5 stars because I am never keen on products which do not allow you to change the battery.Finally, Amazon have a good price on it."
1,80GB Classic ? why?,I had I pod 80 GB for a while ad I am very very disappointed with it The wheel is slow and it locks doesn't reset .Half screen is enjoying.I would wait for next generation hopefully better or Ipod touch with larger memory hopefully this year.
5,iPod!,My iPod of 2 years died and I didn't want to hassle going to the local Apple store to replace it. Thank you to Amazon for making it so easy to buy it via the internet. It came very quickly and in perfect condition!
2,Not sure what went wrong,Was excited when it came. Plugged it into my computer and I got alert messages that I needed the latest version of Itunes. When I tried to get that from my present Itunes...nothing happened. I even went to the Apple site and tried to download it that way but the needed Quick Time program wouldn't load. So now I have a brand new 80 gig Ipod that I can't tell if it works because of this issue. I am sure however that if these issues didn't plague me I would rate this product much higher. As it is I can't even see if it came in working order and is functioning. Disappointing.
1,Stay Away!!!!! Buy another brand. 0 stars. Could not be worse.,"My son got an ipod for Christmas. Less than two months later, he goes to use it and the screen is messed up on the inside. He didn't drop it. There is no sign of any damage at all on the outside.So, we went in to the apple store and they said we needed an appointment. We made one for an hour later (the first one available), came back, waited & waited while various people went on break, usually only leaving one guy on duty. We finally get up there. The guy said that, if you carry the ipod around (actually expect it to be portable), it's common for the side to get ""pinched"" which ruins the screen and they consider it your fault. To fix it out of warranty was $149. So we're out $299 but there's no point in throwing good money after bad.I guess I should keep an eye out for a class action suit."
2,I liked it until it broke,It only took 16 months till the hard drive broke. Replacement by Apple of a refurbished model: $170! Or - I could buy a new one and get 10% off if I traded my broken one in. Yea - you can bet I'm not feeling too good about this - and about Apple - these days.
2,Just not good enough,I wanted to use it as an external drive for my 91gb of music between my mac laptop and my pc. Just to find out you can not do this. You van only have your ipod formated to one-pc or mac-not both. Sound quality is a little worse than my older 30gb video ipod. So I kept my older ipod.
4,My whole collection on one device!,"Can't wait to add another 39,338 songs to my playlist! Beats carrying around 533 cd's!"
5,Good marks for the 160 GB iPod,"The graphical user interface (GUI) on this is much improved. The 160 GB of space is what's most alluring of course. Produces good sound, has a good design and fits nicely in my pocket."
2,sharp edges and games would not upload,The games I purchased cannot be downloaded due to a wrong software version. No comment from Apple how to fix this.The edges of the ipod are sharper than the old ones.
1,Beware of Third Party Vendors,"I purchased this item ""new"" on September 7, 2011, from Too Much Stock, a highly-rated Amazon.com vendor. When the hard drive failed last week, I assumed it was covered by Apple's one-year warranty - only to find that it had been registered in April 2008, and Apple would not replace it. They feel - and I agree - that I was sold a pre-owned iPod that had been repackaged."
5,160gb iPod Classic - Silver,"I wasn't sure about purchasing an iPod, but now that I have, its awesome. Very easy to load songs from my CD's. Battery life is fantastic and the sound quality is amazing. I highly recommend this for a music lover.Apple 160 GB iPod classic Silver (6th Generation)"
4,Great Product,"I bought mine to use with the Monitor Audio i-deck speaker system and so far I can't fault it. Its very easy to use and the sound quality is excellent with this setup.Currently I'm ripping my CD collection at 256kbps, which produces near CD quality. My only quibble is that it takes a long time for itunes to rip the CD's - but this may be my incompetence rather than anything to do with the product. However, once the iPod is connected songs are uploaded very quickly.I haven't tried the provided earphones yet, but from what other users have said these are not worth bothering with. Compared with a previous HDD/mp3 player I bought this is vastly superior in every respect, and I now understand why Apple dominate the market for these players."
1,IPOD Classic 160 Gig,"My first and last Apple product. The click wheel is SLOW, SLOW, SLOW! Surprise - the TV out works only with expensive Apple cables - I bought the $50 cables they are terrible. They are cheap and slippery - very hard to use. No remote control of video.Just got a gift of a 80 gig Zune. Stuck the IPOD 160 Classic in a drawer - the Zune is MUCH better. Zune has video out - video remote - is faster than the IPOD - has a bigger and better screen - etc.. Wish I could get my money back for the IPOD. DO NOT BUY the IPOD 160, it is a waste of money."
2,"lots of bugs, dissapointed","I had a 5.5 gen IPOD before but decided to get Classic this week since it has larger storage and is thiner. I got it Friday, but I have been disappointed with the issues I encountered.1) The new IPOD already crashed once and I have to reboot it. I never rebooted my previous IPOD 5.5.2) Sometimes I connect the IPOD with computer, the IPOD didn't showthe connected sign. Replug the cable didn't help and I have to rebootthe IPOD to make it connected.3) I upgraded Itunes to 7.4.2 so that I can use this IPOD. The iTunestold me there is a IPOD software version 1.0.1 available which I expectthey have some patches. But the upgrade failed because of some ""1415""error.I believe all of those issues will get fixed in the following few months.But I'm still disappointed, they should have done more testing beforeputting it on market.2 stars for what they did. I'll keep this ipod for 1 more week and willreturn it if I still have problems with it."
5,A great product and really a trend setter,"Even though Ipod has been there for years, I just had an opportunity to get one for myself. I was thinking whether a MP3 player like IPod is really requied, and then after I strated using it, i am sure its a good gadget to have. It can be your best buddy at many occassions ! Its worth the money spent. I use this with my new iMac and its all very easy to use and organize music in iTuens. If you can afford for it, go get it and you wont be disappointed."
5,Happy Camper,"Amazon came through, as usual. Item arrived quickly and was a greatprice. Very satisfied with the Apple 80 GB ipod and Amazon."
3,Calendar Syncing Not Quite a Reality,"The ability to sync my Outlook calendar and contacts was the deciding factor in finally purchasing an Ipod. The contacts are fine, but I still haven't figured out a way to point the Ipod in the right place to find my calendar -- a fairly significant disappointment. Additionally, syncing to a PC isn't as seamless as I imagine syncing to an Apple would be. Once I figured out the right order of opening software and plugging in the Ipod it works fine. Overall, the music works fine; it's just the calendar sync that is giving me fits."
2,iDisappointment,"Bullsh#t.It seems that the iPod Classic has had a lot of problems, most especially the shotty click-wheel. At first I thought it was just my model that was defective, then I saw that my friend had also purchased the 80gb Ipod Classic from Amazon with the exact same problem. I don't know if Amazon is selling these defective models or if Apple just schematically left the click-wheel incredibly under-sensitive in order to promote their latest technology, the iPod Touch. I mean why do they purposefully sell these incredibly frustrating pieces of hardware when they clearly have the readily-available technology to prevent such issues? My last iPod video was perfectly fine before the Touch technology came out. WTF HAPPENED?Either way, some big corporation (Apple or Amazon) is cheating honest customers out of what they deserve. They try, man how they try."
4,Calificacion del ipod,eligi esa puntuacion porque el producto ESTA EN BUENAS CONDICIONES Y LA PC LO LEYO SIN PROBLEMAS CON EL ITUNES
3,Works okay,Works okay but doesn't charge using certain wall chargers. Back case wasn't put on as tightly as it could've been and this causes the hold button to get stuck sometimes. Other than that it works great.
4,I pod classic,I had to replace this exact product. I use my I Pod 8 to 10 hrs a day while I work. My old one was good but the phone jack died on me and for the repair cost versus refurbish cost I went with this. So far so good. Holds a charge for 3 days at least and I can't live without it!
1,Heart broken,"I purchased what was advertised as a ""refurbished Ipod classic"" and received what I believed to be an ipod. However, when it stopped accepting a charge I took it into the Mall of America Apple Store. The techie told me that it was not actually an apple product and that they could not fix it. He pointed out some flaws that I had no idea about, one was the serial number being U12345678 and that was not an apple serial number. Expensive mistake on my part. It discourages me from private party transactions."
1,Buy a different model,"Did not work. Apparently some of this particular model don't work sometimes. Like, enough that there are a lot of people talking about it. And there's no way to fix it; tech support can't help you now!"
1,Not Recived IPod,"I Placed an order for the 80 GB ipod classic on October 4, 2007. ITS ALREADY DECEMBER 9, 2007 AND I HAVE NOT RECIVED MY IPOD. Calls have already been made and in process of this delay to be fixed at once. now i'm very dicouraged to purchase anything over the net. X_X"
3,Bitter sweet,"I think this was just released a little too late. I mean all of us are already rocking our 30,60,80 gb ipods. Why go and buy another one!!! And it just is not fair to those owning an ipod that found that this new ""ipod classic"" is the same price or even cheaper than the 80 gb!!! Dissappointing. But still, Id go out and buy it, considering the new layout and so-called ""features."""
1,I am greatly offended by this product!,"I find it quite offensive that apple would not include several operas (or at least arias) sung by the late Pavarotti. How dare they not pay homage to him in some small way? They could at least make the limited Pavarotti edition ipod. It's appalling that they would make a ""U2"" version of the ipod but not a Pavarotti version. I understand that it might have been a bit short notice, but this is important! The releases of products and movies were postponed after the Kennedy assassination, why isn't Pavarotti deserving? He's the greatest tenor of our time, Kennedy was just some democrat who thought he was a jelly donut and slept with Marilyn Monroe. I personally find it extremely disquieting that apple releases music playing devices without showing any respect toward music."
2,hubris,"i think 160 is a bit excessive, especially in this day and age of global warming and international crisis. also, if you think about it, they could have shrunk the size quite a bit by maintaining the hard drive at a reasonable memory level. if you fall down with 160gb in your pocket it's going to hurt a lot more than if you have, say, 40gb in your pocket due to the additional volume/mass. at some point we just have to say ""enough's enough!"" with the memory wars. i mean if it's 160 now it should be 200 next year and 365 the year after that! i see no end in sight."
3,No surprise,"Nothing new, no improvement, not that I was expecting, but it would have been nice to see some thing new and improved."
2,Book does not give enough menus for first two weeks.,"Book is disappointing because, while the author explains the theory behind her expanded diet, she fails to give sufficient guidance. The critical period is the first two weeks, yet there is only one day's menu for that period. Reader is left with far too many questions to allow reader to follow diet closely."
5,Beyond Pritkin Gets My Vote,I really liked the way the author explained the difference between good fats and bad fats and how to use fats in a weight loss program. This book just makes good common sense and I think it will have a long shelf life because its message is that YOU CAN LOSE WEIGHT AND EAT FAT.
1,Not scary at all!,"Not as scary as I thought the storys would be, Will someone please tell me whats so great about There Tearing Down Riley's Bar, will someone please tell me what the twist at the end of this story was?? I recall it being different, we sat through this one waiting for the ending to be a little different instead we hear ""For he's a Jolly good fella"" the only reason I rated this was for nostalgia, save your money and wait for it to come back to the Si Fi Channel"
4,Don't Judge Based On The First Season!,"I hoped for years for a DVD release of Night Gallery and bought this the minute it was released three years ago.While it was gratifying to finally have something on DVD, I felt that this particular group of episodes lacked a sufficient lasting impact. More importantly, I was reminded (and still believe) that the First Season is not nearly representative of the series as a whole.As one will learn by reading synopses of epsisodes aired throughout Night Gallery's entire run, a great array of different ideas, themes, and creative surprises would be showcased each successive season.It has been said that the second season contains the majority of the more memorable episodes. And I would hazard to say that seasons 2 and 3 contain more horror/psychological subject matter, for those who gravitate toward that sort of thing.So that's all the more reason to get those remaining episodes onto DVD. Let's keep our fingers crossed. I'm waiting along with the rest of you!"
3,About the visual quality of NIght Gallery,"It has been stated on jumptheshark.com that Night Gallery looks like those films you saw in driving school only worse. Well, hopefully on this new DVD the show will look visually better than in old tv reruns. One can hope. The show has very solid storlines as far as plots. The monster makeup can be campy in certain segments. However the paintings seen as Serling introduces the eps are always interesting and scarey. This show has Adam West of Batman fame as a guest once and that is very good indeed. He should have been on The Twilight Zone as well."
4,Still scary after all these years,"Still a great watch. Some of the shows are showing signs of age, but overall they are still great. If you are a horror fan, than this is a must for your collection."
2,ROD SERLING'S NIGHT GALLERY - FIRST SEASON,Universal Studios have done it again.....offered a very limited number of episodes for a high price. They did it with NORTHERN EXPOSURE and at the time said the price was high because of the cost they had to pay for the music. Now they offer 8 complete hour long episodes and two half hour episodes and charge a price comparable to other companies offering a full season of 22 episodes. Sure they advertise 20 different stories....but some of them only run 2 or 3 minutes long (remember Night Gallery was an hour program featureing as many as 3 or 4 different short stories per episode). The saving grace here is the offering of Joan Crawford's classic episode of the blind lady trying to regain her sight. But on the overall there is no justification for this pricing for 3 discs and only 8 full hour shows.
5,Great series,"""Night Gallery"" is not as well known or appreciated as Serling's former series ""The Twilight Zone"" but it is certainly worth watching. I'm very pleased to finally see it out on DVD as well as the second season. Now we simply need season 3 to finish it out.The design of the show has never been one that usually works. Two or sometimes 3 stories in an hour program is often not what people want to see. I do feel that one hour story is sufficient, just make it a good story. On this series are some very good stories. What's nice is that you get the pilot movie as well as some bonus episodes from future seasons 1 & 2. The paintings in the series are interesting to see as well.I would simply say that if you are Serling fan then you obviously would want this in your video library. Many of the stories are written by Mr Serling himself and he still hasn't lost his touch in being a great host. I am looking forward to purchasing the second and (hopefully) third seasons."
5,TV Classics at their finest,"I read how many people were disappointed with this DVD. I guess they would rather wait for re-runs to show up somewhere on TV. I remember growing up and Night Gallery came on late after Creature Feature. My mom usually made me go to bed before it was on...but once in awhile, when I was lucky, she let me stay up with my older brother to watch one...always warning me I might get nightmares. Yeah...I got nightmares all right...and loved the show. Wow...now I'm 40, own the DVD and can watch whenever I want. Gee Wiz...being a grown up can be cool."
3,Opening credit music,Has anyone noticed the opening and closing credit music on this first season set is not the original Gil Melle classic? The music was part of the NG mystique. This bland synthesized replacement pales and alters the intentional hypnotic tone the opening visual montage of paintings established. The 3d moving eye chart from hell effect is diminished because Universal didn't think enough of the show to secure the rights. Downer.
1,They're Tearing Down Rod Serling's Legacy,"Like the other reviewers who have posted here, I too am incensed by what Universal has done to legions of ""Night Gallery"" fans. I have to wonder if anyone over the age of 30 gets involved in the decision making process when it comes to releasing vintage TV series like this; just look at what happened to the ""Kung Fu"" season 1 release. I encourage everyone to sign a petition available on nightgallery.net"
1,Looks like Universal dropped the ball big time,"From what I understand this DVD is simply a re-release of a cruddy earlier VHS release originally done by or for Columbia House back in the late 80s or early 90s. I think Universal should be ashamed of themselves. They're sitting on the masters of one of the very best television shows ever put together in the horror genre, and they completely screw it up by re-issuing a lame, older version without extras. I hope this release tanks. Maybe then they'll smarten up and do it right."
3,Interesting,"Well, I'm a little surprised that so many people have given Night Gallery a review without actually watching the DVD set. Well I purchased it the other day and have watched it and there is no need to fear, the DVD remastering quality is excellent. It is so clear that you can even see the uppper lip hair on Patty Duke in one of the episodes. I always liked Night Gallery and so I enjoyed this DVD set. If you are a fan you will love it. Good sound, good picture well worth the modest price. One small quibble...there doesn't seem to be very many episodes on the three discs in spite of the fact that they advertise it as 20 stories. No DVD extras but then most of those unfortunately are usually a waste of time anyway. So all in all a worthwhile purchase if you like the show."
3,Not as bad as they say!!,"Today I purchased the Night Gallery DVD set, and found it to not be as bad as all the negative hype. Most of the episodes That I've watched (I'm halfway through disc 2 of 3) are clear and appear remastered. The only episode that is questionable is the pilot movie. Some scenes appear faded and staticy. Not to the point of ruining the enjoyment of the show, but from what I've read on here I've found myself analyzing every scene frame by frame. It overall is very good quality.My 3 out of 5 stars is mainly because of the lack of any features whatsoever and a pretty generic collection of menu screens. They are pretty lame.Outside of that, it is honestly worth it if you are a fan of the show. I'm 30, but used to watch the show in syndication when I was 13 and became a fan for life!!!Do add this to your collection!!"
1,"No remastering, no extras, no sale","Universal is releasing a quick-and-dirty transfer using error-filled, fourteen-year-old masters instead of producing new high-definition remasters. As an added offense, no extras are included--no trailers, commercials, or commentary. Ask yourself why. Possibly they have no respect for Rod Serling's status as the premier television dramatist of the 20th century? Possibly they care more about a fast buck than giving customers value or presenting their own library with the care it deserves? You decide."
5,Must Have 4 For Fans Of Nostalgic TV!,"Finally it's out on DVD! I remeber ""The Night Gallery"" when I was a kid growing up in the early 1970's, it was one of my favourite shows to watch every week. It's dark & gothic & very atmospheric, & not to mention bizzare. My taste in TV shows/movies in those genres are rather weird but that is just me! If your'e into that, this DVD collection is 4 you. I alredy have Season's #1 & #2 in my DVD library & I'm waiting 4 Season #3 to be released-hopefully soon. I'm rather sad that the episodes w/Gary Collins-{The Sixth Sense} which was a seprate show on NBC which was included w/Night Gallery in reruns. If ""The Sixth Sense"" is ever released on DVD, it will be a must have! AND YES IT DOES INCLUDE THE PILOT!"
3,NO - it was NOT remastered!,"Look, you need to dig a little deeper and do some investigating on this set - especially if you are completely in the dark about the late-Ninties VHS editions issued by Columbia House.Try here, and also, you just may be able to do something about it:http://www.nightgallery.net/ondvd.htmlThat said, the video quality is not horrible.But NIGHT GALLERY deserves better."
2,"Disappointing considering who made it,","I am a fan of Rod Sterling's Twilight Zone, and i thought this show also would be great. To my disappointment it wasn't. I saw the pilot plus season 1&2. I only liked 2 segments of the pilot in this show.They were, The Cemetery and The Escape Route. I liked The Cemetery best, because i think it had: Creepy atmosphere, good acting, suspenseful and great story.I liked the twist ending. I have seen the British lead Roddy McDowall before in several other TV-series. i think he did a great job, acting wise. I gave up watching this show after viewing season 2.If only season 1&2 had any great segments like the 2 mentioned. I think the rest of the episodes lacked the, Creepy atmosphere, good acting, suspenseful and great story. I have to give this series 2 out 5."
3,Season 2 scheduled release in October 2008.,"I just read on the official Night Gallery website that Universal has scheduled the release of season 2 in October of 2008! I hope that they take more care with this one. Even though, it is still better than nothing!"
3,WHERE'S SEASON TWO???,"Universal sure rushed out The Incredible Hulk, Adam-12 and The Munsters, but they can't see fit to release all of Night Gallery. What a bunch of pukes!I'm considering not spending another penny on a Universal release until they release the remaining two seasons of Night Gallery.Universal is the worst ever. They've ALWAYS treated Night Gallery like it was their ugly stepchild! I don't understand it. It's ridiculous!Universal if you want another plug nickel from me, you'd be wise to release Night Gallery seasons 2 and 3 uncut and with extras!Damn!"
1,Dissatisfied,Have never received my DVD though the money was taken straight away - at this stage I will be seeking my money back from Amazon.
2,Don't Bother with This One!,"This was the worst Intimate Moments that I've read in a long while. The villain was painfully obvious from the moment the character was introduced. The hero's first wife died, in part, because he didn't listen to her concerns, writing her off as paranoid. A man who ignores his wife's fears just doesn't appear very heroic to me. Finally, the hero's youngest son talks with a lisp which grew more irritating and less endearing as the novel progressed."
5,Wow!,"In this fast-paced, hectic 21st century world, too few of us pursue lives with meaning and purpose. ""PeaceJam"" makes you realize you CAN make a difference, one person at a time --- so what are you waiting for? A powerful, moving book."
3,To reaffirm and not teach,"I felt that there was not enough spent on the subject itself and more of a dummy's version of getting acquainted with Finance. If you've ever taken one course in Finance, you wiz through the book without absorbing any more than you remembered."
3,Not really sure what I was expecting,I read this on a whim. Not bad but really didn't do anything for me. I guess it's part of a series because there seemed to be a bunch of backstory about characters I was supposed to be keeping track of. Fairly exciting towards the end though.
2,Weterfield's Chain,"It was ok easy read. Simple language, at times got boring and ended up predictably with the use of a standard formulas. The one romantic involvement was not at all credible and rather bland."
4,Masterful Story,"I like this writer's style. There were a lot of characters to keep track of in this story, but what a page-turner! I really liked the lead character, Nick Acropolis, a former Investigator who was thrown off the force and still has a bit of a grudge [and maybe a little love-hate] for the department as he tries to help out an old friend [a cop on the force] who finds himself facing possible suspension for an accident while off-duty. From there the story takes off with a series of seemingly random incidents that keep you embroiled in the story while keeping the crucial piece of the puzzle just out of your reach. I liked it and if you like mysteries, good luck trying to figure out the ending before its time, this one was good!"
3,So-So,"Not a great book by any means, but for a free book is was okay. Don't think I'd read any more in the series as the main character left much to be desired."
3,Too much detail,"As the story began, i found myself immersed in the author's ability to describe in intricate detail the surroundings of the main character.However, after reading 20% of the book, I discovered that the author's desire to describe everything in intricate detail became rather tedious.As a result, I became confused and disinterested. I gave the book 3 stars as there was obviously a lot of work put into the writing of the bookand some people may enjoy the intricate descriptions that the author puts forth."
5,Westerfield's Chain,"Good read. Enough twists, turns & surprises to keep you turning the pages. The characters are well developed and the scenes are real and believable. I'd recommend this book to all mystery fans..."
3,Same Old Story,"Where have I heard this before? Down on his luck cop turns private eye due to no fault of his own - it's the system you know. He solves several crimes at once, he always gets the girl - yada yada. I had a hard time finishing this book and even though it was all a rehash to me, I did make it to the end. It is written in first person - that works well. The characters are flawed and human - that also works well."
3,Wester-fields Chain,"I gave this book 3 stars, I just finished reading this book. I liked the fact that the writer talked about streets in Chicago,neighborhoods in Chicago. I was born and raised in Chicago so I liked the book because of that fact.The story dragged on a little to long but I am not a writer so I can't be a good judge. In my opinion that is. But again, I like books that are about Chicago because when they mention a street I know where they are talking about."
3,Westerfild's Chain,"The story was confusing at the start. However, as I got further into it, things began to tie together.The last half of the book was much more a ""page turner"" than the first half. I almost deleted this onefrom my Kindle, but kept going and decided it was an ok read afterall."
4,Margaret,I thought it was very good and kept interest up and a page turner for sure. I had excitement and a lot of truths Nice reading.
5,A Stand Out of the Later Books,"When Trixie finds a baby in Reddy's doghouse, it starts the Bob-Whites and their families on a quest to find the baby's family. But why was he left in the doghouse? Where's his older brother? And why are his parents receiving ransom notes? It will take all of Trixie and Honey's skills to solve this case before something truly awful happens.This book stands above its neighbors in this series. The entire gang gets good ""page"" time here. Trixie and Honey find clues and put them together logically to reach the conclusions they reach. But, to me, the best part is the development of Sergeant Molinson as a person. We get to see the compassionate side of him that we don't usually get to see.If you've never tried the Trixie Belden series before, this is a good place to start. And if you're already a fan, you'll love this book. Pick up a copy today."
2,Lame!,"""Duck"" is a weak attempt at humor/political satire. One would do considerably better to instead watch ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central.Topics covered include The V.P.'s Duties (mainly hang around; wish that was all Cheney did), Important Moments in V.P. History (eg. Spiro Agnew's resignation), Steps to Take if You're Shot in the Face (actual medical advice - like I'm interested), V.P.s Worse Than Dick Cheney (eg. in Zimbabwe, North Korea), 4 Steps to Impeachment (know the meaning of the word, know your Constitution, House, Senate), People Who Hate Dick Cheney More Than You (eg. Amb. Joseph Wilson, Rep. John Murtha), and Archetypical Dick Cheney Quotes (""We'll be greeted as liberators,"" ""I had other priorities in the '60s than military service,"" ""Go f**k yourself"" - to Senator Leahy during discussion of Halliburton profits)."
2,Not a child's book.,"I didn't read all the fine print nor the previous reviews. Thought this book would be great to read to the kids - ""Amazing Acts of Love and Compassion"" lead me to believe just that - short stories of rescues by animals. This is way too adult to read to my children."
2,"Read better books-the way some stories are explained leave you wondering--""WHAT?"" But is an ok Read",Book in Awesome shape!!!!
5,Pets are Angels,This book Animal Angels-Amazing Acts of love and compassion is such an inspiring book.
5,Impeccable,"Aaron Neville has recorded many fine albums down through the years, but this is the cream of the crop. If I had to choose just one Aaron Neville album to keep it would have to be this one. Impeccable, flawless, and oozing class. But then again, since there's no need to have just one Aaron Neville album, I would very highly recommend this cd for anyone who wants to hear a legendary vocalist exhibit his unique talent."
5,"An excellent British scholar,","Hope this great book comes back into print here. It's wordy, but I always appreciate the detail and background he provides. It's out of print here, it's still in print in the UK, so I got it from there."
1,Misleading and distorting,The book title is misleading as the content is mostly US-centric.The book does not cover many important battles and events and Soviet contribution that had crucial importance for the victory.Not recommended for serious readers.
4,Essential for school libraries and young history readers,"This book, geared towards young readers in middle school, is a useful, short book designed to give these readers some appreciation for World War II in both theaters of war. It semi-obviously promotes the American viewpoint, but still has enough interesting data and anecdotes to bring the human side of the conflict into focus. It has plenty of maps and illustrations/photos, and would be helpful in school sna libraries to provide younger citizens with an idea of what service is all about, and intirduce them to good history telling."
3,Too narrow in scope and too patriotic in tone.,"This book is not an introduction to WWII history. It is a patriotic guide to American victories in WWII. It starts at 1941, skipping the first 4 years of fighting in China and 2 years in Europe. It does not bother with the few setbacks the US experienced nor the early deficiencies in US military organizations and equipments. It has no in-depth analysis into how the battles were fought and why the outcomes came about the way they did. In short, it is a piece of triumphal propaganda.Knowing that this book was meant for kids, I did not really expect an objective and comprehensive work of history. I thought it would suffice for my eight-year-old, who is a real WWII buff. Well, he read the first few pages and began to flip through the rest. He then looked up to me and said, ""This book sucks. It is for babies!"" Fortunately, I hadWar in European Historyon the shelf. He was satisfied."
1,biased and misleading,the author is cherry picking events of world war 2 and forgets to mention that Russian army came to Berlin and that US and England only opened the second front so that not to allow USSR to be a sole victor over the Nazi Germany. 80% of Nazi were destroyed by USSR and 10-20 millions of Russian soldiers died. But those facts were not included in this book.
3,"""How WW2 Was Won""","Book is a ""table picture book"".....not what I was expecting. Item arrived in a timely fashion and was in what might be considered ""new"" condition (with the exception of the marks I found on the front and rear cover). I was not pleased with the plain brown paper the book was encased with....very unprofessional! All else was satisfactory."
5,A Great Surprise!,"I found this book to be a wonderful surprise. The book has a great timeline in the front and back of the book, of the events that happened during the war. The pictures are those that would have been in the newspaper at the time of the events. The facts listed with each event are beneficial also. I find that my young grandsons are checking it out,too as they knew about D-day and recognized the planes. The book draws you back and you find yourself picking it up again and again.d bea"
1,Wish I hadn't bothered,I couldn't get past the first quarter of this book. Didn't like the characters at all . They were very shallow and not particularly likeable. Don't waste your money.
2,Not for this price...,"First, keep in mind that this is not a review of the movie, it is a review of the item listing.It looks like Amazon is charging $26.96 for both of these movies. They are both great movies, but I can't see myself paying that much for them. Why? Because you can get them cheaper if you buy them seperately... from the same website!If you love these movies, then buy them seperately... Amazon offers them at a very low price ($7.99 or $9-10 for in-store pickup) and either way around, you can get them for cheaper than they are offered here in the ""Rush Hour/Rush Hour 2"" bundle.I almost ""wasted"" $26 on this when I could easily save almost $7 in cash! Hopefully you'll find this tip useful."
2,Coleman Company 2Oz Seam Sealer,"This stuff is OK but Water base sealers don't last what I have been using and it was an experiment is E6000 Adhesive for crafts, completely blows anything away.I use this for sealing my Tent Seams it works better than anything REI sells (Mcnett) at half the cost and more than doubled the amount, it dries within 15 Minutes and usable within one day because of this I Cary a small tube for EMG sealing on the trail.It's strong sealing is clear and completely flexible!I have had this on my tents for at least six months now and has not damaged the fabric, dried out, pealed, cracked or discolored and still keeping the seams leak free.I will use nothing other than this product for tent seam sealing.It's Amazing (<:}!!"
4,Useful in conjunction with your teacher,"This DVD is most useful when used in conjunction with in-person instruction from your taiji teacher. Trying to learn strictly from this DVD seems as if it could introduce poor technique. I would expect a taiji teacher would suggest learning solo ""empty hand"" forms, and partner practice via ""push hands"" rudiments before tackling the fighting set.The content is quite thorough, showing the sections of the fighting set at different speeds, and analyzed by the teacher in tremendous detail. Having the entire fighting set available is also useful for careful review."
4,I've got a crush on a girl I know. Her name is Juliet Swango,"If you're looking for something complicated, something that might change the world, don't look here. But if you're looking for something melodic to get stuck in your head for days & days, you're at the right place.This is a loose compilation of some 7""s and some newly recorded songs, and for the most part, they're excellent. It definitely sounds a little more lo-fi than their last album, The Fox.Juliet's voice is awesome and is a lot of times the highlight of the song and what really sets this band apart from dozens of other bands that sound similar.Highlights include ""Safety in Numbers"" (with the excellent cheerleader style ""Got! A feeling! I won't be! Needing!"" bit... which segways into a classic Swango chorus that goes ""Your love anymore""... get it?) & the bass and handclap effect of ""TV Zombie"".It's a shame that the record has to end with ""Fort Surrounded"". A horrible track, to be honest."
1,A Fabulous and engaging book,I am a elementary school teacher and I loved the book so much that I made a unit on it.The students laughed out loud as I read it. They were able to catch on to the pattern and loved comparing and contrasting this story to the folk tale of the Little Red Hen. The wording was excellent and the pictures were darling. The illustrations really captured the essence of the feeling that I am sure the author wanted hightlighted. Great!!
1,Glow in the dark plastic is shoddy - stick to other colors,There is no doubt that Magnetix are a great toy. And you can never go wrong with glow in the dark - or can you? The plastic used in these Magnetix is terrible. They develop cracks at the end that allow the magnets to pop out. I had to glue one back together right out of the box. At least 7 more pieces have failed after just 2 weeks (and many more have visible cracks). This product has terrible quality! We have several other sets in other colors and haven't lost a single piece to this problem. Stay away from the glow in the dark set!
2,Great idea/poor quality,"We were very excited about this game. However, after 1 day of playing realized that the quality left much to be desired. The little magnets kept coming out of the ends of the building pieces, making those pieces unusable. We had to return the Magnetix set and get GEOMAG instead -- it's a bit more expensive but worth it."
1,Disappointed,The glow in the dark magnetics are very poor quality. The set my son has about all of the magenets fell out of the bars. The other set he has are the translusant color and this problem has only happen a few times with them.
3,Great thinking toy / poor quality construction,"This is one of the greatest building toys since Lincoln logs and leggos but due to a defect in the plastic connectors, which are prone to cracking, the magnets slip out when pulling the ball bearing away from connector. I have had to glue many of the magnets back into place with super glue. This product could constitute a choking hazard to younger children even without the inferior plastic housing construction problem."
5,Awesome,"My son just got this for Christmas, and he has been playing with it nonstop all day. He turns 6 next month, and has already asked for another set for his birthday. If you have a young builder in your family, this will be a sure hit."
2,"cool,expensive,and poor quality","they are an awsome idea, but they cost to much,but they are also extremely poor in quality.My son keeps complaining that the magnets fall off."
1,Amazon.com for dummies,"This book is truly for dummies. I guess I expected to learn something that I wasn't already aware of, but didn't/I'm not slamming the Dummies series because I think they're good. This was just my experience this time."
4,Even More Helpful Than Dog Training for Dummies!!!,"My dog still eats my shoes, but now I know how to find new ones through Amazon...the book is does a great job of showing you all the little ins and outs of Amazon that you didn't know were out there - those ""in the know"" know that Amazon ain't just for books anymore..."
1,Comments that are not specific to the item's content may not be posted on our site.,"As a dummy, i found this book written in a condescending and haughty tone. Where are the pictures of 50ft women?"
1,Jaded,"This was not a helpful read ,nowhere in this literary disaster was it ever stated that ""he/she who writes awesome reviews on Amazon will have them deleted for no good reason"""
2,"""Stuck"" on Post-Its","IT says in the title this book is by ""Mara Friedman and mara friedman"" but do not be mislead, this is only one person so you get a biased point of view throughout the book. It's basically next to useless: you can't order things from the book, you can't start your own competing website. It doesn't even tell you how.The ""Dummies"" series has really fallen down. The last good one they wrote was ""Post-It Notes for Dummies"" which provided a much-needed rarely-explored analyses of the history of the Post-it, misconceptions on the Post-it (they are not ALL yellow, believe it or not) and multiple uses for the Post-it. One time this model on the catwalk was totally covered in Post-its like she was wearing a Post-it dress. It was very cool.In summary if you don't like leaving notes lying around DO NOT buy Post-Its and do not bother buying the Post-It book. Unless you want to start your own competing post-it company or something."
5,Books information is very relavant .,I should have read this book first and avoided alot of problems THANK-YOU ILS.jess
1,Save your money,This is insane. All this material is covered on the Amazon web site already. Why would anyone buy a book to learn how to shop a website that's designed to be so user friendly? And why would someone write a book about it?
1,Duh!,"I guess if you just got online and knew nothing at all that this might be of help. But, if you are somewhat experienced and seeking deep and substantive information, this is of little help. The illustrations may require a magnifying glass. The bottom line: this is pretty superficial, and certainly appropriately titled."
2,Scratched and nicked...,"Like ShadowStich (who posted above), I also received a coffeemaker that was all scratched up. Same deal with the flimsy packaging, too. It is gloss black, (the picture makes it look like flat black) which doesn't look as nice, in my opinion. For thirty bucks, it's not a bad purchase, but if you want a perfect finish, this isn't the one to get."
5,better than most,"I went through all the books at Borders, and this was the best for me. No it's not for beginners, it's for people who really want to learn and understand the language as it's actually used. It seems quite difficult to find good books like this.. for those who've already graduated from the ""Hello my name is Pepe"" books."
5,"Inspiring, thought provoking, and true!",Philippe Matthews has done it again...Getting a practical book out that will change people's lives. A book with incredible insights and experiences from well known millionaires. A book that inspires the reader to change their perception and simply go for it. Everybody can benefit from this book! One of your best investments!
5,"All I have to say is ""Those Italians know how to song!""","This is a great single, but you can get you r moneys worth with the Blue single from Hong Kong, or the Asian Single. But this was my frist Imported Single I brought, & I love it to death.I even brought the 2nd CD or part of the Single. CiaoP.s. Italians know how to sing!!!!! Ciao a Tutti! Bye to All!"
2,Cleaning this thing is AWFUL,"If you cook something that has been marinaded, good luck getting the marinade off. It cooks onto the surface, even when it's hot.In the infomercials when it says ""clean up is a snap,"" that's borderline false advertising."
5,Are you impatient & lazy? This grill's for you.,"I received my first Foreman grill as a gift years ago & wore it out. As I read through the reviews for all the newer versions I became concerned that they wouldn't get as hot, or would take longer, or I wouldn't have room for them. I finally settled on this one, and think it is terrific. It is big enough for two & fits in my appliance garage--just.I like food a lot more than I like to cook. I use the grill mostly for chops & chicken and find it heats up as fast as my old one did and cooks just as quickly. I just set my kitchen pinger and everything turns out fine. My grill doesn't smoke at all. I do brush it with olive oil before I heat it up. I don't understand all the fuss about cleaning. I scrape it with that plastic thing after I remove the food and wash it with a sponge & soap later. It is much easier than dealing with a broiler pan and its attendant smoke & grease."
5,"SIMPLE TO USE, WORKS GREAT, EASY CLEANUP","I'll add my ""thumbs up"" to everyone elses'. A quick, neat way to grill with minimum cleanup hassle. I was amazed at the amount of grease that drains off (and we are not consuming). This thing is heavy and so really needs a permanent countertop spot, but is handy enough to probably justify it."
4,"Great little cooker, came with a scratch though","I got one of these for my girlfriend, and she loves it. The main thing is that it's quick to cook, easy to use, and very easy to clean. It's just the right size for one or two people to cook, and you could fit a bunch on if you crowded it.The one I bought came with a scratch on it about 2 inches long on the top cover. Disappointing, but not enough to bother her. Only rated 4 stars because cleanup could be easier (detachable cooking surfaces? Check out the newest George Foreman grills...)"
4,Foreman grill,Easy to clean if one wets and soaps a few layers of paper towel and lets it stand a while. My first one was dropped and broke and I was quite happy to buy the same model at its low price. This one seems a little more loose in the hinges.
4,"Good Idea, but ...","I am a big fan of the Foreman grill machine. The problem is, I use it.I am on my third machine now in less than two years, and the surface is hopeless - again.No matter how much they tell you to use the plasticware, etc, if you use salt or other seasonings in the cooker, you will lose the surface like so many other coated devices.If there was an all-stainless cooker for triple the money - even quadruple - I'd buy it."
2,"Great beginning, then the letdown","I was very happy with this grill when I first got it. I learned to do a little adjusting to keep the chicken breasts from getting too dry. I liked being able to cook without turning my oven on and it was also quick if I didn't have much time. I also found it easy to clean, usually just needed to wipe it down while it was warm with wet paper towels. Now I guess my non-stick coating is gone because nothing I do will get my grill clean. I haven't used any cleaners, scrubbers, etc. on the grill that would damage the cooking surface. The nonstick coating just simply stopping working. I haven't had my grill long enough, to me, to justify spending money on another product with such a short life. The grill has some good features but when you can't get it clean, it's goodby. I also agree with some reviewers who say one temperature can't cook everything. It takes a bit of experimenting to not overcook some meats."
4,It's so good he's put his name on it.,"Seriously, I may brag, but I really ain't no good cook. I find it a total nightmare cooking stuff in an oven and finding the correct cooking times for meats of different shapes, colors and sizes. I was the worst at bacon. I like bacon sandwiches but it made a mess of my oven and I always burnt it. But with the George Foreman grill all that doesn't matter anymore. It'll cook a steak perfectly in 5 minutes. Bacon can be done in 2-3 minutes with little or no mess at all.Just make sure you properly defrost stuff beforehand. Otherwise you'll have a rare inside with a tough and dry outside. A little practice with this will turn the crappest of cooks into gormet chefs no doubt. It'll even make toasties. What more do you want?"
1,Cleaning is a flop,This is a pain in the neck to clean. The cover is not removable so it keeps trying to close while trying to clean it. It is not submersible in water so it is difficult to get really clean. I defintely do not recommend buying this.
4,great grill for low price,nice grill for casual indoor grilling . cooks fast and easy . easy to clean .
3,"""Family Size"" misleading.","We have used & love the original size George Foreman Grill but decided we wanted a larger model. I ordered the ""Family Size"" believing it would be noticeably larger -- I was wrong. Since I got a good price, a family member got a lovely gift; otherwise, I would have returned it. I subsequently bought the George Foreman Jumbo Grill which fit my needs."
4,Very easy to use and clean,"I received this for Chrsitmas and I must say that it has pretty much been the only thing I use to cook meat. I don't have a grill so I was pretty much pan frying everything. This grill cooks the food evenly and the times in the booklet are pretty much on target. If the food isn't cooking on one side, I can flip it and not worry about it. I have never had any meat that was undercooked. The cleanup is very easy...wipe it down with a damp cloth. The most I've had to do to clean it is spray some 409 on it. One problem I had-when I try to cook things consecutively I find that I have to unplug it and let it cool off or else the next thing I cook is blackened. I never thought that I would want one of these things but now that I have it I'm glad I do."
2,Not impressed!!!,"My family and friends and everyone else in America rave about the George Foreman grill so I bought one. It is everything the ads promise but I don't like it. It gets very hot and seems to dry everything out. I bought some expensive steaks from Omaha steaks and upon cooking them the outside got cooked and dried out quickly but the inside was not done enough. I was also not happy with how everything had to be a certain thickness to cook properly on both sides. My husband and I like our burgers thin and I had to keep flipping them because they were not thick enough for the machine. I ran into the same problem with thin sliced chicken breasts.I know everyone else in America likes this product so I guess it is just me, but I'd rather go outside and use my good old fashioned gas grill!"
3,Debbie,"I loved my first George Forman. I was great for making two hamburgers, a grilled cheese sandwich, porkchops ect.It heats up fast an cooks quick. You could have dinner on the table in no time. So I thought having the family size would be great. It takes longer to great up and a lot longer for cooking. I don't think it's as good as the smaller ones."
3,george forman family grill,"a great grill for the price, Not big enough for a large family-I couldn't get 6 medium size burgers on it. difficult to clean-surface always feels greasy"
4,Great food...terrible clean up,"It is very easy to use and cooks fast...I like that it does not splatter grease on my stove BUT the clean up is not real easy. Myabe easier if I did not use the marinades on chicken but that is how my family likes to eat. Nice for my boys to be able to cook use before or after practices BUT they never clean this up right after using which makes it even harder to clean.Has anybody used the cleaning sponges? If yes, do they work?For the price and convenience it is worth the cleanup aggravation."
1,terrible,I only tried once. Works fine. But no ease to clean and the layer just came off. Returned it right away.
1,primitive,The machine has only one heat level for whatever you make. As a matter of fact there are no buttons for anything on it. Moreover you can not remove the grills so it is a hassle to clean it.
3,Never got the cookbook,"Never got the cookbook, despite correspondence with Amazon. Chalked it up to items coming from two distribuion centers. Can supply e-mail proof if necessary.Lucretia Hickok"
2,Disappointed,"I bought the basic model grill and was disappointed. There is no temperature gauge, no ""on/off"" switch, no removable parts for cleaning. We have used it 3 times - for steak, burgers and shish kebobs. One half of the grill cooks faster than the other - probably because of the lid that ""floats"" on its hinges to accommodate different thicknesses of meats. And there was a lot of smoke (as some reviewers have said). I like the non-stick surface, but it would be nice to be able to get it in the sink to clean off the mess. I also like the slanted angle and the fact that the grease drains off. I had thought that I would be happy if I bought the better (more expensive) model - but decided I will wait to use my outdoot gas grill next time instead."
4,"Small, but great","This is the smallest grill they make, but it is good for two people. Clean up is relatively easy, and it cooks quickly and evenly."
4,So far so good,"So far this thing has been great. I am paraplegic and wanted something safer than the stove. This is it. I read a lot about various grills and these ones kept coming out on top. It keeps the area that it is operated in clean, which is important and cooks the food fast. Still early days for me but nothing but praise for this product. Also you can't beat the price when you compare it with what's out there."
4,Easy to use and clean,"Takes less than 10 minutes to cook anything from hotdogs to steaks and everything comes out perfectly cooked. You do need to watch over the device, as no timer comes with this model and you need to monitor the food for how you like it cooked, i.e. rare, etc. Very quick and easy to clean."
3,George Foreman Family Grill,"I really like how fast and grease free our food is done,but we expected it to hold more.Our family grill only holds 2 steaks,or 3 chicken breasts at a time,and thats not enough for a whole ""family""."
3,"Ya, it does what it says it would.","I would like to have purchased one with climate control, instead of just on or off. Easy to burn food if not watching closly.The drip trays are very small and do not hold much run off.Cooking area seems to be smaller than I imaginged, 4 small burgers ok."
4,love it,"I love my George Foreman Grill, I received it for Christmas. I would give it 5 stars, except I wish there were a way to keep the drip trays from moving if you accidentally nudge them. The juices drip onto the counter if you aren't careful."
4,Great bang for the buck!,"I LOVE this machine! I bought it after previously owning one of the smaller grills. This unit allows me to cook 20 chicken wings at a time! How cool is that?! The only down side to this unit is that the plates are not removable, making clean-up somewhat of a pain. Also, the large size made for difficult storage, since I don't have much countertop space. All in all, I would recommend this unit."
5,This is just to simple !,"I seen lots of TV programs advertising everything that is surpose to be better then anything else in your kitchen,and I always pass on the new stuff and stick with the basic.Well George Foreman's grill took the cake, of course I still use my grill outside, but when it comes to bad weather like snow in Pa, I pull out the foreman grill and get almost the same perfection I get from my 600.00 Weber grill outside for just 59.00 bucks. You can make anything on this grill ! ! !"
1,"If you like unevenly cooked food, and hard cleanup.","I purchased this grill for my new house, and I had three major problems with it.1) It cooks the meat, even thawed meat, unevenly. By the time the meat is cooked through the outside is often hard, dry and flaky, or charred. Thicker meats always get charred.2) The cleanup, even right after the meat has been taken off, is time consuming and messy. It is almost impossible to get the unit completely clean and has many little areas to trap grease.3) After one use.. with a normal wash cloth.. the finish was scratched and starting to come off.The ONLY thing I enjoy using this unit for is making grilled cheese sandwiches and grilled wraps."
2,Could have started a fire!!,"I loved my grill. After about a year of using it, it just stopped working. Being a little handy, I opened it up to see if I could fix it and found that ONE OF THE TERMINALS ON THE WIRE HAD BURNED UP! This is a metal piece that got so hot it disintegrated.Is it a fluke or is it a manufacturing defect on all their grills? Will you risk the safety of your family to find out?"
5,Works great,With a large family this works perfect! You can cook for many at the same time and it does not take long at all! Great for large steaks too!
4,My 3rd grill,This is the 3rd identical grill I have purchased in less than 2 years. I really like the way that it cooks everything from meats and fish to all types of vegetables. The large cooking area is very useful and a major consideration. The only downside is that it doesn't last as long as I believe it should before the heating element or thermnostat stops working and I need to replace the grill.
5,I wasn't sure....,"But I am SO glad I purchased this grill. I didn't realize how much better everything tasted grilled. We put hamburgers, pork loin steaks, hotdogs, chicken breasts and grilled potatoes on it so far. It's quick and easy. It took a few times to figure out how to clean it, since it doesn't clean well after it sits and the food dries on. We have learned to spray it with a little water from a spray bottle, plug it in for just a few minutes, and then wipe it down with a wet paper towel. It comes very clean! If you aren't sure what size to purchase, buy one larger before smaller. There are only two of us and we are glad we purchased this size...the smaller one would have been too small for what we use it for. This just fits two ready made hamburger patties."
1,needs a better method of cleaning,"i like using the grill but i wish they would have made it easier to clean and for this reason i dont use it as much as i would like. can someone get back to foreman and tell him that this is a big problem, when advertising on tv they never mention the cleaning."
3,Family Size?,Love the convenience and ease of the George Foreman Family Size grill but was surprised by the size of the cook surface. Fits two burgers but does that feed a family.
5,Tip for cleaning,"I use my George Foreman grill at least once a week. We love how moist our chops and steaks come out. I have found however that cleaning is tricky. What I usually do is let the grill cool completely (sometimes overnight) and the drippings/marinade gets hard. Then I use the spatula included to scrape off as much stuff as possible (it usually will flake right off since the grill has a non-stick coating), and then I use a damp sponge or cloth to wipe off the rest. I highly recommend buying this grill - in fact I would recommend buying the largest one that your family can possibly use (we purchased the large grill and I wish I had bought the extra large). You will find it indispensible."
5,Best Kitchen Appliance EVER!,"I am absolutely in no way a homemaker by any means. That or even a chef! So as soon as I saw an ad for the George Forman Grill that cooked chicken THOROUGHLY in less than 10 minutes, I was game! I bought one for my fiance and I, and made chicken breast that night. I have never had any meat so moist and juicy, yet thoroughly cooked (not pink) and appetizing as I did that night!! I would marry George Forman if I wasn't already engaged! This is a wonderful product, and definitely pays for itself the first time you use it! I guarantee you will use it at least 3 times in one week, if not more. We love it, and rely on it for the best tasting food ever!"
5,George Continues a Good Product!,George Foreman GR26CB Family Size Plus Grill performs as well his previous product that was a hand-me-down from my parents. The old one lacked some of its Teflon from years use by my parents and I continued using it several times daily for 1999 till the Teflon was basically gone. I sprayed it with Pam for about a year but opted for this new one for easier clean-up. Would liked to have tried the removable plates model but reviews have not been that great on their heating and cooking. Am very pleased with the heating and cooking of this model and look forward to many years use!
5,I LOVE GEORGE~!!! OXOXOXOXOX,"I tell you this is the best thing ever happened to me. I am a healthy eater, and cook at home all the time. But also I must admit I am on the run all the time, and this Grill works as my cooking partner, and still allows me to eat well in short time. I do row veggies and row fruit as my main diet, and use skinless checkin, and fish for some meat needs once a while. Time is essential for me at this point in my life, so I depend on this grill a lot. It is small in size to fit in my small kitchen counter, but also large enough for company of 4 or so. After all, cleaning is like a magic. It is so easy, and does not take a minute. I do not need any bigger grill even if I had to cook for more people, all I have to do is clean and cook again in just few minutes, the meal will be done over and over. George Forman Grill is making some improvement, but only minor. There is no need for much as long as it does the job, and they do. Try and see...."
2,"Great Brand, Bad Item, Super Amazon Service","I can vouch for George Foreman quality. This grill replaced my original after 9 years of use. However, this particular unit proved defective. After several uses the first three months, it suddenly stopped working when plugged in. I returned the item to Amazon and was refunded the entire amount quickly. I have since purchased a larger Foreman grill, no problems to report. An aside to fats-conscious but bacon lover moms: the Foreman grill does an amazing job making crisp bacon while burning off much of its fat. Makes the juiciest burgers I've ever cooked, too."
1,NOT A GOOD REVIEW,"I ordered the George Foreman Grill and when it arrived, the lid/cover was cracked and I was sent a replacement and the second grill was also cracked. I did not reorder a third time."
1,Careful with this,http://komotv.com/stories/40912.htmSome safety concerns if there is a small child in the household. I don't think I will be buying this.
1,"Not practical, unconfortable",I bought this product to have an easy way of getting tissues while I am driving. This is the wrong product for that. It is VERY HARD and DIFFICULT to take the tissues out of the box. I wouldn't recommend it.
5,A rare and extraordinary book,"This book is a follow-up to the original ""Classics"" published 50 years earlier. This 2nd edition is a glorious tribute to those, past and present, that have left a lasting imprint on the specialty of dermatology. The book highlights the individuals whose brilliance, perseverence, and curiosity have led to amazing progress in dermatology.'Classics"" provides both biographical information and the original descriptions reprinted from the original works. It is exhaustively researched and written with great clarity. An enormous pleasure to read. I recommend this book highly; a real treasure."
2,One piece of the set,"I purchased this product for my son, who already had 3 of the 6 in this ""railbot"" set. The last one was not in stock. After looking around, I found that Amazon did not actually sell this toy, it was sold via E-Toys, and that all of the other sites which Google pointed me to were also E-Toy sites, which also did not have this last toy in the set.I thought that the internet was about having choices..."
3,"not good if you really think it's a ""Bug Club""","I got this set on the pretense that ""The Bug Club"" would include at least one episode on bugs/insects. IT DOESN'T! It's about learning about the world around us from a kids perspective. And that is OK, but not what it said it was. The set comes with other very informative and fun episodes. BUT IT IS NOT ABOUT BUGS!"
4,Get it in store.,"I purchased this from Amazon. 3 weeks later I saw it at a national retailer, and the Amazon price I paid was 25% higher. I'm normally pretty happy with Amazon, but in this case, save yourself the shipping delay and pick it up locally. As for the product itself, my 3 year old really enjoys this series, and she likes these as well as the others we have."
2,Only the Plague,"All of the symbolism, moralizing and pontificating aside, The Plague was only slightly less boring to read than DeFoe's A Journal of the Plague Year which was painfully boring. Character scenes are drawn out endlessly. Not for me."
3,"Camus is amazing, this edition...not so much","First of all, I highly recommend reading Camus--he is so insightful and eloquent. However, I would recommend picking a different edition. This one has many errors and typos, and the lack of footnotes is not desirable when reading a translated text. But let's face it: even Camus with errors is still amazing!"
5,FOW's sleeper smash hit,"this is one of the best songs ever, i cant believe it wasnt played on the radio. FOW is one of the best bands, mixing the likeness of beach-brit pop with an Emo-Indy sound, but not too produced to be soldout. Everyone should like the FOW!"
1,Wrong Bible ?,If You Are A Vietnamese Catholic.. This Is The Wrong Bible... Most Of The Translation Are Wrong And It Has A Mix Of English And Vietnamese.. As If The Translater Cannot Concentrate On His Vietnamese.. 95% of the names are mispelled or sometimes english is used.I Recommend If You Want A Bible For Catholic.. Get Something Else.. This Is Not The Right Book.. But If You Are Baptist.. This Might Be a Good Book For You..
3,The Brute and the Beast,"If you are a fan of Spaghetti Western films and this has caught your eye you will be pleased to know that ""WILD EAST"" has just made availible an official US release version of this Lucio Fulci ""Shoot'em Up""! Wild East has once again give us a crisp and clean version with Special Feature, an interview with director Lucio Fulci. You get the opportunity to view both the Euro English version, ""Massacre Time"" and the AIP-dubbed ""The Brute and the Beast"". Both are presented in anamorphic widescreen. Do your self a favor and check out ""Wild East""!Enjoy[...]"
2,No Near a Massacre,"I purchased this movie because I was such a big fan of Lucio Fulci's horror movies that I wanted to see his non-horror movies as well. Now because the director is known for his gore and with the title Massacre Time, the movie is billed as this ultra-violent bloodbath, but it is far from it. I was surprised to find such a straight, run of the mill western from Fulci. If you are looking for Fulci's infamous gore, do not buy this movie, this is only for Fulci fanatics who desire to see everything Fulci."
1,YUCK!,"When I think ""dark roast"" I think full bodied and DARK. Melitta pods are the worst I've tried. I've tried Senseo pods too which are only mediocre. I did find the Target brand ""Archer Farms"" pods to be the BEST. The French Roast really does rival Starbucks home brewed. Its cheap too...3.99 for 18 pods. If you like a full bodied, rich, dark and strong cup of cofee, don't do Melitta. I found Senseo and Archer Farms pods fit in my Melitta pod brewer just fine."
1,"Good coffee, terrible quality control",About half of the pods had to be thrown away since they were not sealed correctly and were leaking coffee grounds all over the place and into my cup. No quality control whatsoever apparently.
4,My Favorite Offering from Melitta,"This is the Melitta Pod that I make sure is heavily stocked in my kitchen. While the others taste fine, I prefer this for the bold flavor and stronger dose of caffeine. 4 starts because of inconsistent quality - most of my pods have tasted good, but a few seem a bit stale at times."
2,Product changed-used to be much better.,"We have been buying the Melita Buzzworthy Dark Roast pods for over two years and were quite satisfied. Recently, they increased the diameter of the pods to enable them to fit other machines. I also understand thet they have increased the diameter of the pod holder in the new machines they are selling. At the time Melita made these changes, I believe they also reduced the quality of the coffee in their new pods because it just does not taste nearly as good. Accordingly, I rated the old pods with 4 stars but the new pods deserve only 2 stars. We are now sampling pods from other companies to find a good dark roast coffee."
4,Awesomely Vocal,"I think Eddie off of Family Matters Could Sing I Mean I knew he could sing but not like that when I first Heard him open his mouth in the movie Something To Sing About With Tamera Mowry from sister in it, but anywho I like the movie but i can't find the SOUNDTRACK No WHERE. (...) thanks Love Live LifeTony"
5,Wonderful music,"This CD is filled with wonderful, up-lifting gospel music. Listening to it is like watching the video. They are both VERY hard to find. I had to contact the distributer of the movie( wwp.org) to order the soundtrack and the movie. Hope this helps you Tony!"
5,Crystal clear reception throughout house,This product delivers what it promises. It provides crystal clear reception throughout the house and even as far as 1/4 mile down the street. It does not interfere with a wireless network or cordless phones. The two-way function is excellent and we are thrilled overall with the quality.
4,quiet,This monitor is quieter than my first monitor which makes a lot of white noise. It works well and two receivers are great.
3,"Good monitor, not very loud","bought this on the recommendation of a friend, but somewhat disappointed. the selling point is that it's quiet. the downside is, you have to listen much more carefully than with other (less expensive) monitors. we put the monitor on a table the is directly ajacent to our bassinet. if you are working in the kithchen or the garage and have it on max volume and max sensitivity, you can't hear the baby until he starts to scream at the top of his lungs.all in all it's a decent monitor and is much better looking than most monitors, but i think i'm going to use it for my older baby. we'll use our old monitor for the newborn so we can hear him better."
5,Freedom,"I purchased this item when my husband was diagnosed with dementia and a host of other medical issues. He slept a lot and needed 24/7 care. He was constantly confused as to were I was. I couldn't even go outside to tend my flowers, until I purchased this product. I took a monitor with me everywhere, mowing, tending flowers, even swimming in the back yard. I always knew when he needed me, all he had to do was say my name. He had cancer of the larynx and could hardly be heard if you were sitting right beside him. But I heard him every time no matter where I was. I used the second monitor upstairs to alert me at night. This product gave me the freedom to continue to live and sleep as I cared for him."
1,Not at all what I expected.,I bought this item because of its long range. I suffered the price tag so that I can work at the end of my yard while my daughter was napping. The range on this product is as long if not longer than it claims but if there is something blocking its range the monitor is rendered useless. In addition to this the volume is not loud enough. If there is other noise while listening to the monitor you can barely hear your child which is important if you child gets as sick as mine. The battery life is not long enough and the price is way too high. Do your self a favor and go with the Sony Baby call it is worth it. Best Reguards
3,low noise low battery,As others have said there is an impressive lack of noise with these units. I've got cordless phones and two wireless networks and still everything is quite clear.The battery life is low with long recharge times.The system sets up with little confusion or hassle.
1,Disappointment,"This product was very disappointing. With they hype, high cost and coming from a company I trust, I expected better from this unit... It has very poor sensitivity, the rechargable batteries on the parent units die far to quickly, you can barely hear any events on the monitor and there is no audible alarm (or at least if there is one, it didn't function for me). I installed a camera with microphone onto my phone intercom system and am MUCH happier now!Panasonic KX-TGA573S 5.8 GHz FHSS GigaRange Expandable Digital Cordless Camera"
3,Short battery life,"We've owned this baby monitor for 2.5 years now. Like every other Chinese made product, it's reached the end of its useful life. I really wanted to like this monitor. The audio quality is fantastic. It worked well enough for our first child, but now the parent receiver only holds a charge for 3 hours on one set and 30 minutes on the other. We've changed out the batteries, which did not make a difference. The only way this device works now is if we keep it in the charger. The one plus is that it will work without batteries in the parent receiver, so that's how we use it. Just turn it on and keep it in the charger. It is an average product at best. It's too bad that we just live with the fact that products don't last anymore. In comparison, my son still plays with a toy that was mine 35 years ago. It may not meet today's coolness standard, but it was built like a rock. I can't wait to introduce him to my old Tonka trucks. Talk about a durable toy."
5,Fantasic baby monitor--long range is great!,"We have 3 baby monitors--two Graco and this Philips Avent monitor which we love. Our Graco monitor is the digital and works pretty well, but we needed a second one that would not interfere with the Graco for baby #2. We were worried after reading reviews about the battery life and volume, but have been very pleased! Just yesterday I was able to go 5 houses down outside with my 2 year old while the baby napped and got no interference or static! We have had no problem with the batteries either, although we were very careful to follow all of the step up charging instructions. We have both parent handsets off daily and they have never died on us yet. The volume is quiet until the baby makes a noise and then it is plenty loud at it's highest setting. It is well worth the money!"
2,A bit disappointing!,"When you have a title like ""Magic Realist Oil Painting"", that is what one might hope to expect, but was not my experience with this book. It should be called mediocre realism in oil painting! I did like how the author provided step by step illustrations for how he approached and dealt with specific problems in various paintings, however. Painters may find some useful information, but it is not going to be magic. The quality of the illustrations could be a whole lot better also."
2,Skip reconditioned!,"I purchased this on the Friday sale for $12 for my husband who is a coffee fanatic. He has wanted a carafe type coffee maker for a long time. Couldn't resist the price, even though I have never purcased a reconditioned/refurbished item before.Good points: fast brewing, carafe keeps coffee warm.Bad points: no see through line gauge to show you how much coffee is left in carafe, no timer, large maker for only 8 cups, and VERY hard to clean.WORST POINT: I have had the coffee maker since July 11, and it stopped working 2 weeks ago. I contacted Amazon, but they would not let me return it since the 30 days is up. I was advised I must return it to the manufacturer! Big hassle!!!"
3,Incorrect information,"This is a good coffeemaker, BUT it's 8 cups not 10. I have told amazon and see that they have not corrected the information. Don't expect a 10 cup."
5,Great Coffee Maker at a Great Price,"I can't say enough good things about this coffee maker. If you want an inexpensive coffee maker that brews very hot, good tasting coffee with an amazing carafe that keeps the coffee hot for a long time, this is the machine for you. No worries about leaving home and forgetting to turn off the heat plate, there is none. The thermal carafe does an incredible job of keeping the coffee hot for hours without need for heat. Unit turns itself off after brewing. Finally, I've found a really good coffee maker."
3,an ok product with an oddity,"This is a good brewer, and does keep coffee hot for a long time. One major oddity (or flaw) for a thermos carafe like this is the requirement that you preheat the carafe with hot water before brewing to minimize breakage of the glass interior. This is a pain, and it seems that it shouldn't be necessary -- especially since versions of this unit come with a timer (not this one)!"
2,It will do for now,"It doesn't seem to have a ten cup capacity. Leaks when you take the caraffe out. Good cup of coffee, I guess it will do for now. Came boxed and wrapped nicely. I guess it was worth the $... and free shipping?"
4,"Great Coffee, but water capacity smaller than advertised","Wonderful machine makes great coffee (and keeps it hot for hours), but water capacity of reservoir and pot is only 8 cups on the COF-900FR model we received. Still A good value!"
3,eh,I got this thing on sale for like 12 bucks. And that's exactly what it's worth. Don't expect any frills with this one and you won't be disappointed.
3,Good price...,I just received this yesterday and it looks really nice. I had paid 19.99 for it and now it is 12.99 - so advise anyone who is interested to buy it now - for that price you can't go wrong - this is a good company.
1,Misleading Editorial review+No 24hrs timer/ 10cup as stated!,"I bought 6 of these coffeemaker and listed to sell on an autionsite boasting this advertise high point on the 24hrs timer as per the Editorial review with a NAIVE assumption that Amazon.com is reliable/reputable seller! I got nothing but returns for refund, bad feedback for telling lies on my listing! I wrote to Amazon.com asking to compensate for my lost to refund to buyers infull plus paying S&H; for the items to return back to me but they reply with just an apology, when I asked them if I can return these back, they coldly told me it's over 30 days now and nothing can be done! I'm very disappointed with their customer service's attitudes! I wrote 1 review similar to this last week and they did not list it, I hope this one will go thru unless they want me go send this somewhere else!!! I'll not trust what they said in their listing anymore, and please be advise by this review that their UNTRUE facts list just increase by 1 now!"
1,Completely Unhelpful,"I thought this book would be like other graduate level program manuals and explain all the complicated and tedious parts of the application process, but it does not. It gives a brief and useless description of all the programs in the US but it would be easier and more helpful to just look them up online. There is really no useful information in this book, it will probably be best put to use in my wood burning stove."
3,Missing two bits,"The knife is great looking and very useful; however, when I got mine, it was missing two of bits. Not too big of a deal for me. It is just that I expected to get what I had paid for originally. Other than that fact, I am very pleased with this item and would recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile tool."
2,"thought I would love it, but couldn't like the author's voice","Nashville, memoir, raggedy, nostalgic, down home, country star coming -up in the 60s-- I thought this book would be a fascinating and fun trip into that world. But the narrator was just unlikeable to me. I read a few days then quickly gave this book away. I could NOT feel sympathetic to this author. I'm writing this review so much later I can't recall specifics but in short, this was NOT the book I was looking for above."
3,"If I was 18, this would be a ""cool"" novel !","A quick read. I enjoyed the book but felt that there were many under-developed characters. The premise of the novel was promising, however, I don't feel the author ever delivered. Throughout the read I felt as if the story, and the book, would appeal more to an adolescent reader. As a gay man who is an avid music lover I really wanted the story to examine the hardships of being involved in today's music industry as a gay artist. There definitely was an attempt here by Mr. Lewis, but I don't think he quite hit the mark. Lewis is a good writer and I would read a future endeavor. This one just didn't do it for me. Kind of all over the place and really didn't ever go anywhere."
2,Not as shown,I ordered the pattern shown on the computer with the B-25 on the front. My husband works on a B-25.I only ordered it because of the B-25 on the front. It came with only pieces of the B-25 showing.The actual airplane pattern layouts were very disapointing. I would not have ordered it if I knew the patterns would be so chopped up on the actual shipped product.I am very disapointed with the product recieved.I would have bought more aviation shirts if I were happy with the product as received.
4,Definitely a keeper!,"Excellent book, strong storyline. Highly romantic.Only two weak spots: the main character can tend to waffle (a la 'Scarlett' nonsense), and sometimes explanations are overlooked in the narrative ('when did they put down the glass?' type stuff), which can be interruptive. Much stronger writing in 3rd-party-observation mode, and that alone makes it an outstanding read.(Have had this book for several years, even while ""recycling"" others at a local used-book store. Even while rummaging through my collection to decide what to 'recycle,' never have to re-read it to remember why I want to keep it.)"
2,"Ok, but could be better","my son is so hard on his iPod nano, that he has to have something to protect it and this case does do that. i've had to replace this case 4 times. the first thing we do right out of the package is cut out the clear plastic on the inside. that clear plastic makes it difficult to use the click wheel and causes a glare on the LCD screen. after about two months the belt clip on the back comes loose and eventually falls completely off. if i were the manufacturer of these ""Podfolios"" as they call them, i would not use the clear plastic on the inside and re-enforce the belt clip."
1,Negative stars actually. Scratches IPOD,This thing WILL scratch the surface of your IPOD. It scratched mine :( BEWARE!
1,"New wine in old wine skins, Professor?.............","You know, I read with great interest recently, how a holocaut museum had to ask the LDS folks to STOP baptizing the murder victims who died jewish, into the Mormon movement. I have to wonder what Luther would have said about this ill fitting cassock you've asked him to slip into......again. What's great about the US, is that we're free to believe as we choose, even the most pointless things! such as the idea that given more time, Martin Luther ( Of ALL people! ) would have gotten over his fit of temper and come back to Rome! Where a most forgiving father would have wagged a disaproving finger and graciously welcomed back the naughty prodigal. How wonderfully convenient to forgo the reasons for the debate in first place ( LOL! ). After all nobody DIED over this stuff. As you can easily guess, I read all of your book that I care to. May GOD the SON indeed grant you your just reward, sir."
3,okay,"It's okay, and, incidentally, a better book would be, for example, Eleventh Year Mathematics, an Amsco book by Isidore Dressler and Barnett Rich."
3,No refund :o,"The book came in good condition; however I needed to refund the book (Switched to a higher class of Calculus).Buyer told me she ""Already gave the money to her brother, whom she owed a large amount of money...""Hence the middle of the road rating."
4,works good...,"One Saturday morning he gets up early, dresses quietly, gets his lunch made, puts on his long johns, grabs his dog and goes to the garage to hook up his boat to the truck and down to the driveway he goesComing out of his garage the rain is pouring down: it is like a torrential downpour. There is snow and sleet mixed in with the rain. The wind is blowing at over 50mph.Minutes later he returns to the garage. He comes back into the house. Turns the TV to the weather channel and he finds it is going to be very bad weather all day long, so he puts his boat back in the garage, quietly undresses and slips back into bed.There he cuddles up to his wife's back, now with a different anticipation and whispers, ""The weather out there is terrible"". To which she sleepily replies, ""Yeah, can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in it?"""
1,Very disappointed,"Upon reading the excellent recommendations of this book, I bought this book via United States-Canada-Mexico. I had a big disappointment upon reading it since does not offer nothing new with respect to the help included in the system. If you do not has neither idea of as operates Filemaker, I recommend you that opt for reading the help of the system... it will be saved some money."
3,"Nice tune, interesting lyrics","Santessa Phased:Received the CD from Amazon.co.uk for less that a third of what is being asked on Amazon.com.Track 1 - Phased: 4:14 Nice tune, interesting lyrics, Santessa has a nice voice.Track 2 - Phased Remix: 4:03 Basically RAP music. A bit monotonous.Track 3 - Best Thing: 7:26 Of the (two) songs on the CD, this is the best one. Hopefully this track is a sample of her potential. I will buy her other Cds when the prices come back to reality.Video: 04:14 Not sure about the video - black and white - Santessa is skipping rope and singing `Phased`.The video is creepy. Not sexy at all.To sum up: You get about 12 minutes of good music and a creepy video. Track 2 doesn't even count. There are tons of talented artists who work hard for their money. For example: they give you 45 minutes to an hour of good music. Hopefully, her other albums are better."
4,Great machine but skip the melitta JavaPods,"I received a 1:1 for my birthday and really, it's perfect for someone like me - I work at home and if I go to the bother of making a full pot of coffee, by the time I'm ready for the next cup, it's already gross. And thermoses just don't work for me - I forget them and they grow mold.I tried the Melitta coffee and have to agree that it's pretty bad. The Buzzworthy was drinkable, barely, but the Love at First Sip gave me headaches and the shakes.I shopped around and tried podhead.com and poddepot.com, and am now getting the rich flavourful coffee I was craving. The podhead Italian Blend borders on a good Americano. I bought the 100 pod sample pack, but I'll probably stick with the Italian Blend going forward."
2,Major problem finding coffe packages,"The coffee maker is great, the coffee is great but you cannot buy the coffee for it anywhere local in southern California. All Target sells is the package of mixed types. The Melitta web site is non-functional for purchasing java pods.Great coffee maker but Melitta has failed miserably on filling the supply chain with the correctly package coffee."
4,the perfect marriage begins here,"I purchased this along with the capresso milk frother machine. Side by side they complement each other nicely...I find the melitta alone could stand to be a little hotter, but with some super steamy milk added, its perfect, they are definately better together! I also look forward to some other coffee options (millstone would be heavenly!)"
3,A Bit Strong for Me,"I like the ease of use for this coffee maker, however I am having a small problem with the light continuously blinking, even after I check everything. The coffee is a little strong for my taste (I am using the light roast and the 8 oz large cup!)but it's easy enough to add a bit of water. Much better than instant and no waste. I wish it were a bit easier to find the pods, other than on line."
2,"Great concept, but needs alot of improvements","I got my on sale for 25.00.... The tea is great or at least my one year loves the RAzberry. The coffee though is digusting, and horrible tasting.... It reminds me of hotel coffee, whereas I prefer a rich, strong, thick coffee.... This is pretty water down and tasta horrible. The hazelnut was passable, but if you are used to drinking premium coffee. You will not be impressed. So with a bit of work, some better coffee beans. And maybe a joint effort with Green Mountain, CC's, Community or some other coffee source. To produce better coffee for the one pod.... And more flavors. I will deal with my coffee machine, grinding the beans, and then my darling daughter and I can take our daily walk to the coffee shop.... Where I will buy my wonderful double expresso...."
2,Weak Coffee,"This sonded like a great idea, BUT, in practice, the machine produced insipid brew that tasted like it came from a subway station vending machine (maybe that's how vending machines function.). Certainly any boutique cafe would go out of business if they served coffee this weak. True coffee lovers (not Latte drinkers), would not find this machine any good.Only positive aspect is that the little packs of coffee make cleanup easy."
1,Melitta One 1-Cup Coffee Maker,I bought this coffee maker for a friend at Christmas and was real excited about it but when I went to his house and saw how it worked and the small amount of coffee that it made I told him to take it back to the store that I bought it at. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.Mary Hoffman
3,pod method works,"I bought this machine and can only find pods (that fit it) online at amazon and target. I did find another source for pods with premium coffee (go to podhead.com)just excellent coffee, made for this melita one/one machine. easy to use, no clean-up, hot, fast coffee........do i recommend it? YES"
2,"Leaky product, unknown how they could be selling it.","I was very excited to bring this coffee maker home and try it out. Initially, the coffee was poor and un-rewarding, but after about 6 cups it settled out and made very nice coffee. Up to this point, I was relatively happy. Shortly after however, I was noticing water puddles on my counter. I figured out the coffee maker was leaking slightly around the coffee pod area, just a slot leak, but enough that I returned it.Now I bring home nummber 2... and almost instantly, the thing is leaking very quickly. This time, not around the pod area, but from the base of the water tank itself. Not even making coffee, I could watch it drain right onto my counter. This one got returned too. I really liked the look and even the coffee from it, but they haven't mastered holding water. Very leaky, I couldn't recommend one to anybody, too bad really."
1,Not working,"It's not working. I took as instruction and kept waiting ...for hours. Nothing ever happened. Do not buy this product. I have good experience with Stamina-RX and Ezerex (expensive).Bad products: Vivid virility, Orexis, Advanced Yohimbe, Cobra.(I tried all of these with no effect)Good: Stamina RX (sleepless), Ezerex(expensive) .These work fine for me"
5,"Short Bio, As Advertised","This biography, less than 200 pages, is exactly the short biography it advertises itself as. The author, Alan Axelrod, covers all the high and low points of Patton's career, while identifying a number of themes throughout Patton's life. Foremost among those themes is the failure and difficulty Patton experienced when not in war. From Patton's successes during WWI and WWII, to his rough treatment of his wife and possible affair with his niece during the mid-1930s when war did not appear imminent and Patton saw little fighting in his future.Patton changed the army and conducted some of the most brilliant operational maneuvers during WWII. He is rightly regarded as a brilliant battlefield general. If you are looking for a quick overview as to why he is considered such, I highly recommend this book."
1,Not Worth the Money Paid!,"I am so disappointed with this purchase. This item is definitely NOT worth the price paid! The paint chips off very easily, exposing the silver underneath. The item comes in two pieces and does not fit together at all. The metal pieces needed to be bent to fit the pieces together and does not sit levelly in any way.I would send this back if it had not been damaged when we put it together, but it was damaged in our attempt to put this together because it was not made properly. This item is not worth buying! Don't spend your hard earned money on this piece of junk."
1,Dissapointing,"I bought this CD hoping to build my vocabulary on my way to work, but stopped using it after my first trip. It is basically a list of english words that are almost identical to their italian counterpart, for which you could thus have guessed the meaning anyway. I expected a selection of words based on the frequency at which they are used in a language, but this selection seems (strangely) to have been based on similarity.PS The experience is further frustated by an irritating repitition of the italian national anthem on the background."
2,Not her best outing.,"When we read romance, we are most often seeking fantasy and a departure from the day-to-day. Don't we deserve to have it well written, too?"
2,NOT a winner!,I bought this in the white version about eight or nine months ago and would not recommend it. We have had problems with leakage and have not thought the coffee stayed hot as long as indicated.
1,wrong picture,"Mine was delivered today. ""Minor Cosmetic Damage"" is in fact wear and tear so severe the Cuisinart label is 1/2 worn off. Also, the picture shows a stainless steel carafe. What you get is a black plastic carafe. I would expect some disclaimer if the images are not in fact the item."
3,wouldn't buy again,"This would be an excellent coffee pot. It makes perfect coffee, keeps it hot for hours, and is easy to use. But, unfortunately, it started leaking within the first month of use. And by the time I got ahold of Cuisinart, first they tried to tell me that my warranty was expired (which it wasn't), then they insisted that I return it at my own expense with $10 and it had to get there before the warranty expired. Ordinarily I wouldn't mind that, but it took them so long to return my call that this was impossible. So now I'm out the money and I have a coffeepot that leaks and makes electric shock noises, and the company won't back up its warranty. I would not buy another refurbished model from them again."
3,Works as Advertised,"I wanted a combination DVD/VCR player. This object turns out to also be a VTR, which is okay. The instructions are printed insmall type and are distributed across the pages like acommentary on the Talmud--read a box here, turn the page 90degrees, read another box, turn the page again, etc. They aremajorly unreadable. So, unless you've owned one of thesebefore and can intuit how to work it, don't expect much fromit. It's a little taller than the average such box, so measurethe space in which you plan to put it. I had to do somechiseling out of the underside of a wooden shelf to fit thebox in. The Amazon web site does not give dimensions for the object."
5,wow,"Wow, I have to say that this Sylvania DVD combo player i bought it for my mom and i have to say it is great the quality is great and i would recomend this product to anyone if i have to buy another DVD player i would buy this one again."
3,RK,The product worked well for 10 months and now I can't hear voice whenever I put VHS tape.. I tried to clean it up and but no luck.. very cheap make and worth is for $60... thanks
2,piece-o-junk,Terribly designed remote. VCR player got noisy after a few months of light usage. Slow DVD. Remote stopped working. Into the dumpster.
1,lemon,I bought this device two frustrating months ago. It is ok when it works but that is usually not the case. The instructions are awful. The ability to record is awful. I don;t know anyone I hate enough to give them this machine.
1,"Sorry, nothing against your company, but VCR was defective...got credit,but dont agree with paying shipping for defective item..",I am not happy about having to pay $13.00 to send back the vcr which was defective. If it not functioning properly....the shipping should be on the company and NOT the consumer....
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,This unit is worse that the old VCR it replaced. The CD player works all right but the VCR is terrible. The sound is wobbly for the first ten minutes of each program. The horizontal sync jumps and caries on for the first five minutes. Any time the tape is stopped it starts jumping all over again. Any frame adjustment has to be redone whenever the power is turned off. Not worth the aggravation.
5,Love wise,I grew up on Wise potatoe chips. My daughter loves the salt and vinegar and won't eat any other s & v. Sent her a case of snack bags and they are making the rounds at her airforce base.
5,WOW!!!,"This was a great book. I found myself on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading. I always wanted to see what was going to happen to Tyrone and Debra. This book was so captivating, I couldn't put it down. I give it three thumbs up!"
2,Ehhhh. It's okay. A little repeatative.,"I bought this album on a whim cause it sounded really cool and I'm usually pleasantly suprised when I purchase stuff on amazon on a hunch. This album was a little dissapointing though. It's kinda weak. It shows the artists limited skills and gets very repeatative. If you really enjoy this kind of euphoric ambient creepy sound, I would highly reccommend Speedy J. Speedy J is what Acid Scout is trying to be."
1,What was Toshiba thinking?,"I bought this combo player because it was a Toshiba~I've always had quality products from them~Not this time,though~From the moment I plugged it in, the dvd player audio was muted~I had to turn it up almost all the way~this, on every dvd I played. The vcr player was fine for a week, then, slowly it started skipping towards the end of every tape, then, gradually all the way through, and then, the crowning blow,the sound went out! I could finally see why they offered an extended warranty~The player is a piece of garbage~Toshiba~you need to go back to the drawing board on this one."
4,Good for My mom,"I bought this product for my mom, and she love to use it.I hope I won't need to use it ;)"
1,not red,only reason i purchased because it says its red. they shipped a generic yellow handle that is available at any store. couldn't send it back because it was needed the day it showed. spray painted it.
4,Laptop Companion,"It's a nice, inexpensive retractable mouse which I bought for my laptop. It feels a bit light but this isn't really a problem. However, it would be nice if the cord could extend another foot so I could plug it into the other side of the laptop. Otherwise, not bad."
1,Dead Mouse,"Had this mouse for a few months and it died on me; don't know why, it just stopped working."
4,Resident Evil Zero Official Strategy Guide,"This was a great investment for me. I'd have the game for a while now and was stuck at the brakes of the train and the book finally got me past that part. It also help me get through the game easilier. The only thing I didn't really like was that the book doesn't always tell you the correct thing, but when it comes to codes or passwords, it helps alot. I have Resident Evil 4 and I had to get the book for that game also. They really help you out. I would recommend this book or any Resident Evil book for the games because the game are very hard to get through without the books."
2,They could of done better with this.,"This is the first Resident Evil game that i've ever owned and so i needed help with the game. I've played all the games but never owned one till now. Anyway, i get the game and have to buy a guide. I buy one and i start playing. I find some of the stuff they asked me to do near impossible for a first time person. I found myself doing parts over again 3 or 4 times before even getting anywhere close to compleating them. In other words, the guide was almost no help at all with some parts. If u can find another guide, buy that one first."
3,Not the best.,"I found that Prima`s Guide are more detailed.I stink at games,so I needed a edge and I bought this one.I would not buy another one from them."
2,fail,"I purchased this as a gift, so I have not watched it myself. I can only hope it works properly. My issue is with the way the product is shown. I expected the actual jacket-- like the one in the description. And for the price I paid I certianly expect some sort of bootleg cover if you are going to be sketchy about the description. Very not impressed, it better play."
4,So personal and yet so universal,"Katie Singer's ""The Wholeness of a Broken Heart"" spoke to my heart. Her story is truly personal and yet universal. Through it she shows us how each of us is shaped by the richness of our family's history. The Yiddish expressions she uses are priceless. Though I don't speak or understand Yiddish, I feel that it's in me somewhere, that the sound of the words affects me in some unexplained way. Read this book. I hope it will move you too."

4,Great plan,This is a great diet that includes a good amount of monounsaturated fats that keep you feeling full and satisfied. This plan works and there are charts how to substitute the peanut butter for other monounsaturated fats and create your own meal plan. This does work and I am proof.
5,"My husband loves peanut butter, and this diet.","The main idea here is not that you gorge on peanut butter but that you use it to supplement about nine servings of vegetables a day, creatively prepared. Thank goodness it's not all salads! It has helped him to normalize his cholesterol and triglycerides, and works amazingly well for him."
4,Talking Peanut Alert,"Dr. Peanut asked me to post this review. He has nothing against people eating peanuts, but he noticed that the book failed to mention the difference between the kinds of peanuts that people can eat (and should, as the doctor can explain) and the Talking Peanuts, which he hopes no one eats anymore. ""Please,"" he says, ""think of the suffering!"" Nutty to Meet You! Dr. Peanut Book #1"
1,not written with care,"This book must have been thrown together quickly: In the area that gives the menus, with page numbers for different recipes, the page numbers are often wrong: Peanut Butter Bagel is on page 203 (not 000), PB&J on Rye is on page 201, not 202. I feel ripped off. Elizabeth in McKeesport"
1,a big disappointment,"I love peanut butter so thought this would be great. I sat down and went through the whole book the same day it arrived. Then I closed it, put it in the bookcase and it hasn't been opened since."
1,Deceiving,"If you believe Britain made what Africa is today than this is the book for you. Pakenham portrays the scramble for Africa as a two-player game between Britain and France, with little attention being paid to the portuguese, german, italian or spanish presence and interests in the continent. As a result, Pakenham's book is really a book about the British scramble for Africa, neglecting some of the most curious cultural and political aspects of the heterogeneous european presence in Africa. Focused in Britain, Pakenham also misses the opportunity to explore the reaction of african cultures to colonial advances and the position of independent african states. It is therefore a rather poor book and one in which prejudice against other european colonial powers is too often evident."
2,Difficult and tedious,"I found this book difficult and tedious to read from the typeface on -- even though I'm interested in the subject and have a B.A. in Pol. Sci. It might be helpful for Africa scholars, but not for the general lay reader. I'd recommend instead Shillington's HISTORY OF AFRICA."
4,Daunting scope,"On a subject of such scope, no author can produce a single volume that uniformly satisfies the disparate expectations of a wide audience, as the reviews reveal. Suffice to say that a vast amount of information has been woven here into a readable book that will take the uninitiated from ignorance to the point of being well informed on the subject; such is the purpose of a book for the intellectually curious general reader. An estimable book, in my estimation."
4,Scramble for Africa,"Thomas Pakenham's Scramble for africa is a very good book on a fascinating subject. Colonizing africabegan well before the book's opening 1876 conference hosted by Belgium's King Leopold II, but after this event, according to the book, the ""scramble"" was on. European nations, primarily Great Britain and France, but also Belgium, Germany, and even Italy, sought territorial gains. This is imperialism at its nadir.The author implies a hodge-podge, willy-nilly scramble for land that resulted in Europe dominating Africa within a quarter century from the book's 1876 opening. David Livingston, Pierre Brazza, Lord Salisbury, and others based political and professional legacies on what happened in Africa. Great Britain found a way to emerge as the leading colonizer, so one could state they ""won"" the scramble.But Pakenham covers nearly every aspect of the European domination of the dark continent. The book is fast-paced and well written. The reader will not be disappointed."
1,It's misleading!,"This item is actually a NXE SP 2+1 Harness. I did not want that harness, and this picture showed the harness that I did want. I would return this before you even buy it.On the NXE SP: The belt is cheap, and too small for the harness itself. Good luck running in this thing. Also, it won't hold anything above 20oz (CO2), 48ci(3000psi), or 68ci(4500psi). Don't get this."
1,product not as shown,"I received a generic cloth in a zip lock plastic bag, with printed general instructions. The cloth was not the name brand as advertised."
5,best starter i found,"very clean and easy, and much easier to light than the other startes I have been able to find."
2,Rodney C. Duckworth RULES!,"A low-grade imitation of American Graffiti/Animal House/Hollywood Knights, et. al. that was all the rage in the late 70s/early 80s. The adventures of a geek named Rodney C. Duckworth and his efforts to end his virginity. Directed by Max Baer, Jr. (Jethro Bodine from the Beverly Hillbillies, who was better off as a brain surgeon or double-knot spy). Quack on, brother Rodney, you RULE!"
1,dumb movie,"If you are reading this review about this movie you have already spent too much time on this movie....it stinks, no it reeks....don't even think about buying it"
2,packaging problem,This item was ordered as a birthday present for a grandchild. The package was damaged upon arrival and the book was mangled. We are not sure if the USPO was responsible or whether the original packaging was inadequate. The book had to be returned for replacement.
3,Would be great but has technical problems.,"The mouse sensitivity randomly goes back to the lowest setting, even with the newest drivers installed. There is a weird disconnect between the Razer control panel sensitivity and Apple's Mouse system preference. Both have to be set to highest sensitivity for the mouse to perform at highest sensitivity. The problem is that Apple's system preference randomly resets to the slowest setting in-game. This makes the mouse useless since I have to minimize the game to reset it."
2,"Doesn't work in so many ways, it's almost impressive","Cons:The side buttons are absurdly small, fiddly, too close to the back.The programmable side buttons won't learn show desktop or task switch macros because, if you press them in the programming menu, your PC will either show desktop or task switch.I have programmed backspace for one of the buttons for web-browsing. It doesn't work but pressing backspace on my keyboard does.When I turn the PC on, I sometimes have to unplug and replug the mouse otherwise it remains 'off'.It's too small and flat. The Microsoft/Razer Habu is about perfect in this regard - if you really want a Razer mouse, I recommend that. The buttons programme correctly on the Habu as well.It doesn't work on my desk - maybe something to do with the white surface. So I have an optical mouse for which I have to buy a mousepad.It feels cheap.Pros:It looks nice.Er, that's it..."
4,"Good performance, some flaws","I like the mouse, I find it comfortable to use and the ""sensitivity adjust on the fly"" is really handy. The side buttons are kind of awkward to use, but I've gotten used to it and don't feel like I'll get RSI from using it. The weight seems just right, and the Teflon glides are nice (i have not had to clean mouse-goo off the bottom of it in the two months i've been using it).My real complaint is that the scroll wheel glows bright blue. It is very bright and you can't turn it off. There is nothing you can do about it except throw a towel over it or unplug it if you want your room dark. It is that bright. I watch movies on my computer and find it terribly annoying. I am tempted to disassemble the unit and find a way to permanently shut it off.Update: I have, in fact, taken it apart and disabled all the LEDs inside. Now its *really* dark, since the sensor uses infrared or some other non-visible light. It was very easy to make the modification."

2,Not Worth Ordering,"This PPV was a total bust with only the Main event, Austin vs Jericho, being watchable. The rest was just extended RAW matches. It will not be remembered so don't get it. Buy an ECW DVD, you won't regret it."
2,No Way Out was NO Way Interesting,"I was expecting, like previous No Way Outs, that this was going to be a great show, but this was one of the most boring WWF PPVs I have ever seen. I dont know if all the wrestlers were just resting before Wrestlemania, but no-one put on a good show. The NWO coming back was pretty good, but predictable, and the main event was just half an our full of chest slaps, with below average wresling."
5,NWO comes to the wwf,"THIS EVENT WILL BE REMEMBERED PRIMARLY FOR THE DEBUT OF THE NWO IN THE WWF. HOGAN, HALL, AND NASH WALK DOWN THE AISLE AT THE BRADLEY CENTER TO KICK OFF THE SHOW. THEY THANKED VINCE FOR GIVING THEM A CHANCE AND COMPARED THEMSELVES TO THE WRESTLING FANS. WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR HOGAN TO SPEAK, HE GOT A NICE POP. NOTABLE MATCHES AT THIS EVENT INCLUDE: RVD VS. GOLDUST ( THIS WAS ACTUALLY A GOOD MATCH), HHH VS. ANGLE W/ STEPHANIE AS REFEREE (A GOOD MATCH WHICH FEATURED HHH GETTING SCREWED AT THE END), ROCK VS. UNDERTAKER ( THESE TWO NEVER DISAPPOINT), AND AUSTIN VS. JERICHO FOR THE UNDISPUTED WWF TITLE. HAD THE NWO NOT INTERFERED AND COST AUSTIN THE TITLE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AUSTIN VS. HHH IN THE MAIN EVENT OF WRESTLEMANIA 18 ( OH WELL). THIS WAS A GREAT EVENT AND A GOOD LEAD-IN TO WRESTLEMANIA 18. EVERY WRESTLING FAN OUGHT TO CHECK THIS ONE OUT."
3,Pretty Good,The tag team turmoil was a dead give away(like in royal rumble) because if you come out near last you have a good chance of winning.in rvd and goldust match it was just boring.Also william regal had some brass nucks in his trunks. the # one contender match was a rip off but stephanie got hit a lot. The rocks match was the best on the card because of the ending(it suprised me. Then in the undisputed match was very borring they were just chopping and hitting each others heads on the turnbuckles for 30 minutes. Then the nwo comes out and paints on stone cold.
3,nWo is no Way out.,"The event was ok. Nature Boy made a big mistake by interfereing in the Undertaker vs. The Rock. He hit Undertaker a few times with a lead pipe. He had no buisness being involved with the match. Well, Undertaker got his revenge at WM X-8. I was glad to see the nWo return. I was also glad they shut the Rock up the next night on RAW. Scott Hall said it best ""So much for the People's taste"". I was glad Kurt Angle won the match against HHH. He deserved that title match at wrestle mania, but ric flair [cheated] kurt otu of the title shot the next night. I can't stand billy and chuck. So I was glad to see Tazz and Spike retain the titles."
4,2002 No Way Out means.......N.W.O !,"The best thing about this pay per view is the long awaited return of (Hogan,Hall,and Nash), aka N.W.O. Love-em,or hate-em,any fan of the New World Order should own this video. These bad boys of wrestling are at the top of their game here. They talk the talk,and walk the walk, during their days in the w.c.w. the N.W.O. made it cool to be bad. The rest of this event is also worth seeing. The 2002 No Way Out is a,""to sweet"", sports entertainment event."
3,Average At Best,"Match with Van Dam and Goldust is the best match of the night in my opinion. I was really disappointed with most of the other matches except Rock vs. Taker and Jericho vs. Austin, which were both great matches and helped set up WrestleMania. NWo coming back was good but they ruined the main event's finale in my opinion."
4,nWo- new World order!,"WWE Tag Team Title Match:Spike and Tazz{c} vs Booker T and Test **(out of *****)-Umm.. why are Booker T and Test here? Why not switch them with adeserving team like Christian and Lance? Booker T and Test have not wrestled as partners in a long time and they get a ttitle shot? This makes no sense what so ever.Tag Team Turmoil ***-This match was not that great and could have been a whole lot better. I still don't get why the WWE didn't use the APA, Dudleys, Hardys, Billy & Chuck, or Christian and Lance Storm in the Tag Team Title Match but oh well.Now the good stuff:RVD vs Goldust ****Edge vs Regal ****'Taker vs Rock ****HHH vs Angle ***1/2Austin vs Y2J ***1/2-And thats it, this PPV wasn't too bad, if only the WWE did something with that Tag Team Division. If you want a real good PPV from 2002, check out these:Royal Rumble ****Wrestlemania X-8 ****1/2Judgment Day ****Vengeance ****1/2"
3,No Way Out,alrite well the only good part of this ppv is the nWo ...usually the No Way Out PPV's turned out good but this year it kinda went down the drain cuz they had no matches to build up really they were juss mainly matches that you would see on Smackdown or RAW if u wanna see a good No Way Out PPV get 2000 or 2001
3,O.K. and dissapointing,The matches are ok but what I really looked for in this event was the return of the NWO. It was a stupid decision to let the NWO come out as soon as the ppv started. They should have did what they did at Bash at the Beach in 96 and let the NWO have their grand entrance at the end.
5,"A bittersweet, hilarious, & beautiful tale.","Being a big fan of Eric Schaeffer's films ""My Life's in Turnaround,"" ""If Lucy Fell,"" and ""Fall,"" I was thrilled to see ""Wirey"" and after it came out, it took me awhile to finally see it(it never came to the theatres where I was living at the time, so I had to wait for the DVD release)but when I purchased it(without seeing it, mind you), I fell in love with it just as I had his last three films. ""Wirey"" is loosly based on Schaeffer's own childhood and Eric Mabius plays the younger version of Wirey, while Eric plays the older. Absolutely hilarious at moments(watch the baby...trust me), hard to watch in others(the tense relationship between he and his mother), and blissfully romantic with his ongoing affair with love. It's so much different than most films, that is, being well-written and original, and I highly recommend it."
1,Somebody stop this guy!,"It's beyond me how Mr. Schaeffer continues to find funding for his self-indulgent films. He seems to think he's the Woody Allen for the new millennium, but nothing could be further from the truth. Having seen two of his previous efforts, I should have known better than to give ""Wirey"" a try. But I'm a forgiving soul, and I watched it. Assuming that Mr. Schaeffer's repeated use of himself as a leading man reflects an autobiographical bent to his work, he's a misogynistic, selfish jerk who seems to think that everyone else should be interested in his inability to find romantic happiness. Note to Eric: Just because you know you're a jerk, that doesn't make it okay to be a jerk. A line from ""Search and Destroy"" also comes to mind: ""Just because it happened to you, doesn't make it interesting."" Avoid this film like the plague."
1,Not good.,It didn't have what I was looking for. It was difficult to decipher. It was not useful at all. I don't recommend it.
1,terrible service,it has been a month since ordering and it still has not arrived. I would not purchasefrom this source again
4,Good but not his best,I enjoyed this cd but it isn't one of his best IMO. I bought it primarily because I had read that it was well recorded but I did not find it to be special in that regard.
3,Too Much Detail,"This book, although very interesting for an older reader, contains concepts and details that are quite advanced for a Level 3 ""Ready-To-Read"" paperback. It is definitely overly mature for a ready-to-read style of book. I would recommend it for 4th grade on up, although my own children easily read at ""Level 3"" independently by the end of 2nd grade.The illustrations are trite and somewhat comical. The whole book should have been a little longer and turned into a ""real"" book rather than attempting to fit into the ready-to-read mold."
2,Disappointing,"This is a most disappointing product. Firstly, the picture quality is not good, and, secondly, the subtitles are frequently printed in white on a white background, thereby rendering them useless. The actual film, which I first saw many years ago, has, frankly, not improved with age, and I now can only consider it somewhat feeble and overrated."
2,"Love them, hate the fuse.","I love these speakers. Look great and sound fantastic. I use them for rear speakers on my surround sound system. However, the lightbulb blew and when I replaced the bulb, the light did not come back on. Speaker worked, just no light. After taking the floor switch apart, I was alarmed to find the fuse was blown and it was soldered in. That's right, a $300 speaker and they solder in a 5A cheap fuse. Yes, soldered in. Not replaceable. I spent $20 on an iron and spent an hour replacing the fuse. So, BEWARE! It shocks me that this company would resort to such a cheap solution. I would expect it on a $99 speaker, but not one for $300. Seriously, Soundolier should be ashamed. They need to fix this on future products. I even sent them an email and no response from them. I guess they don't care about service after the sale. Again, love the sound and the look, but just confused on the cheap soldered in fuse in the floor switch."
1,Soooooooo not worth it!!,"These little gems are supposed to improve sound quality by reducing outside noise. They don't. Plus, they are uncomfortable. They also tend to fall off the headphones when the headphones are removed from the ears."
5,Una Joya de libro con dibujos de Jose Luis Cuevas.,"Cuando se juntan 3 Genios dentro de su ramo: Jaime Sabines, Jose luis Cuevas y Daisy Ascher obtenemos una joya como esta. Poemas de Jaime ilustrados por Jose luis y fotografiado por Daisy. Existe una edicion firmada y numerada. Por otro lado existe otra de 1000 ejemplares. Una joya, si amazon la consigue Genial!"
2,Where have you gone to my lovely,"Why on earth did Peter Sarstedt decide to re-record his wonderful song, the one that made him famous all over the world -""where do you go to, my lovely""? This new version, with his voice (to be kind) definitely not what it was, plus a musical arrangement so far different - and really nasty-sounding - that I thought my newly-arrived CD was flawed. Really maddening. I heard this song 30 years ago and fell in love with it, as did millions of people. The rest of tracks in this 2 CD pack seem to be re-releases of Peter Sarstedt's previous recordings, so why fiddle about with the favourite one, hasn't Peter S heard of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'? My recommendation - if it's the Peter Sarstedt of 30 years ago you want to hear - forget it, don't buy this one, you'll be bitterly disappointed! Either stick to your vinyls or try and score a CD with this track in its original form!"
3,Is Abuse OK if a Woman Has No Children? Please Read.,"This song, even though inspired and well-intended, left me asking this question. You always hear about the children of abuse and now label the woman of abuse ""the baby's mama"" but what about the abused woman without children? Also, this label of ""the baby's mama"" inforces the thought that a woman is nothing more than a Husband's-Wife (Mrs. John Smith) or a ""Baby's Mama""...doesn't she have a name, an identity and a life of her own? Or, is she only an extension of her husband or a breeder of her children?"
5,True life put to MUSIC,Very moving piece about a true life experience. Really makes one feel her pain and anguish. Can not wait to hear the whole CD.
2,Expect Disappointment,"If you're looking for up-to-date information on Native American crime, you'll be sorely disappointed with Lester's book. The vast majority of the sited data is from the decades prior to the 1990s. I reviewed the book for a college course about violence and found it to be tedious and very disorganized."
4,Clear and Consice but too Compact,"While what the book does explain about the statistical theory mentioned, it is too compact for what it tries to explain. There are also no answers to the excercises, which would be quite helpful given some of the questions asked. It's great for applications and is a good handbook, but for a thorough explanation of everything involved, I recomend getting a bigger textbook! For my 4th year Generalized Linear Models stats class, this book is helpful, but at times too compact to be more useful."
5,Great overview of GLMs,"This book is a great overview for someone who already has taken a course in mathematical statistics with a strong focus on inference and estimation. However, don't expect too much detail on any of the methods. The real strength of this book is that fact that it is concise, and gives you the grand picture of GLMs in a very clear way. If you're looking for a book that goes into more detail but covers less material, I would highly suggest Freedman's Statistical Models: Theory and Practice."
5,What is the difference?,What is the difference between DeLonghi EW0507 SafeHeat Electric Energy-Saving Oil-Filled Radiator and DeLonghi EW0507 Safeheat Advanced Oil-Filled Radiator? Similiar price and features. Are they the same thing?
4,inspector rex,"While we lived in Australia, we were able to watch Inspector Rex (subtitled) on SBS channel. It is a fun show. Especially if you are a dog lover. The new Moser is very cute too."
3,DO NOT PURCHASE!,The label engineer should be taken out and shot in the head! A brilliant album ruined with a hatchet job of mastering. At one point the tape actually ripples during a track and the overall sound is bleak and muffled.Someone should license this great album and start the mastering from the original reels. I bought one import from Germany and another from Japan so I have two CDs that sound terrible and in the same places what the hell was Warner Brothers thinking?Find an LP of this and just make a CDR for yourself if you are a fan of Jordan's fine work.
3,Charles Schofield,Deepak has a world wide reputation which is more than justified. That said this current offering is high on promise and unfortunately low on the delivery of value in the form of 'how to' information and spiritual development techniques. As with so much of contemporary quantum theory literature today this collection weaves an interesting story but that is all. Of course we can all robustly influence or own futures through our intentions... but Deepak come on... how about a few techniques. The Essential DVD Collection?... perhaps not.
3,Please include a better format next time,"First, I must say I agree with the reviewer who said, ""this current offering is high on promise and unfortunately low on the delivery of value in the form of 'how to' information and spiritual development techniques.""Yet, my biggest complain is that this type of video does not serve well those who see Chopra for the first time. The primary reason for this is because the format is rather boring. What you find here is just a collection of his presentations, rather than a cleanly editted program. You will find many of his teachings repeated in the four different presentations.And, again - these are all very nice stories, which should help to inspire you in your daily living, without demonstrating how to."
2,Very poor quality,"Item arrived with one of the little diamonds missing. Also, two of the prongs that hold the sapphires are too long, so they catch on my wife's shirt sleeve. We are returning it for a refund. At lease Eve's has a good refund policy; we'll see if they live up to it."
5,"Classic novel by a ""Grandfather"" of Southwestern Literature","This is the most popular novel by Frank Waters based in the TaosPueblo environment that he knew well. It should be made to be a movie.Indeed, attempts have been made and no doubt one will someday be successful.A story of cultural interaction and one well rmembered after reading.Still in print along with most of Waters' 26 books that include non-fiction."
2,Not A Hide A Key,It's amazingly cute but doesn't suit it's purpose. There's no way it will ever hide a key. The hole is much to small.
4,For Serious Checker Players,"Pike's book provides strategy's for the serious checker player, however, he omits opening strategies. Still, there is a lot of interesting information about the history of the game provided by Pike."
4,All Kinds of Disasters Discussed,"This book describes devastating hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, fires, shipwrecks, air disasters and industrial accidents. Over 100 incidents are described with the entries averaging 2-3 pages. There are some black and white photos. Also included are items such as ""how to survive an earthquake"", ""protecting youself during a fire"", ""el nino"", ""active volcanoes in the United States"", ""seismic waves"" etc. Glossary and index included. An informative, concise volume although due to the cost, you might have to be satisfied with browsing the book in your local library."
3,Cheap but works,"I no longer have the car I installed this in, but I still hear the system working. A neighbor bought the car. I know it has been in for a year. Not sure how long it will last.Pros:InexpensiveGood features(I like the inside temp feature, and 2-way feedback)Good rangeInstallation- not TOO terrible!(had to buy a starter adapter harness and some relays)Cons:Cheaply made('carbon fiber' is just painted design)I suspect there isn't much customer support"
1,ripoff,tried to have instaled by 2 different installers and was told this is an inferior productwhen i contacted seller received no response for a return
4,Nice small camera,"This is a feature packed little camera. I liked the cameras small size. I'm quite happy with the image quality of a printed 8x10. I don't have a use for anything larger. I found a couple of the features very useful. Best shot selector shoots up to 10 still images then saves the sharpest. Nice for intances where you can't use flash or can't see the LCD screen. The camera can make a copy your pictures in a lower resolution. Just select the smaller size and the image is ready for email. I found the 3X zoom a bit small, maximum focal length is 14.1mm I've seen 2X cameras with more magnification. The flip of that is the wide angle is real wide. The macro setting can shoot incredibly close. 1 inch or 1 foot when zoomed. The camera did have a little trouble locking foucus in macro mode when subject(flower) did not fill image area. Focused great otherwise. I will use this camera for quick shots when I don't want lug out the SLR."
5,what an upgrade from a HP camera that is only 2 years old,I have an HP 315 and this new Nikon absolutely blows it away and it was like $150.00 less that I paid just 2 years ago. Easy to setup. Great picture quality and the flash is much much better than others I've tried.Nikon has a great track record. I think this camera bolsters that attention to detail.
3,"Camera OK, Service Expensive","I purchased this camera as a gift for my wife. She had been looking for an easy to use camera, with lots of features, to keep in her pocket or purse. My daughter had previously purchased the Coolpix 2100 and was very satisfied. So were we, with the 2200, until two weeks ago when it stopped taking photos, for no reason. I followed the warranty procedures since it appears to be under warranty. I just got a ""bill"" from Nikon, asking me for $138.00 to repair the camera - it cannot be repaired under warranty. No explantion of why it can't be repaired, just send the money and we'll repair it, or we'll ship it back. I wrote Nikon and asked why the repair would cost more than the original price of the camera. No answer yet so we'll see what happens."
4,good for skin pictures,I use this at my office to photograph skin problems and record them in my patients' charts. excellent macro mode and clear clean detail.inexpensive 2 megapix but functionally great and simple.
5,A Christmas Treat,"Etta James has taken 12 Christmas standards and performed them with a comfortable blend of jazz and soul. Unlike some other Christmas cd's that sound like the performer is just going through the motions, Etta genuinely sounds like she is enjoying herself while she sings these songs.The arrangements range from small jazz trios to full horn sections. Each is appropriate, and well done."
3,Makes For A Cool Yule,No real surprises on the song choices but a nice addition to my Christmas CDs.
2,Disappointing,"I had read decent reviews of Etta James' new Christmas cd, 12 Songs Of Christmas and figured I'd buy it. My mistake was not hearing any of it beforehand, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered. Unlike in her 60's heyday, Ms. James can't hit the notes anymore; she sounds like she is really struggling along while her excellent backup musicians play beautifully. Sorry, I realize Etta James is one of the queens of jazz/r&b(I do have several of her records)but this album is a waste of your money. Get her recordings of when she was in her prime,though, and you are in for a treat."
1,Horrible Execution,"It is not only Mac users who will want to throw this thing out the window. I had numerous errors using a G3 and G4 Mac running OS9, including printing and especially scanning, so I finally gave up and connected it to a PC running Win 98, only to experience about the same thing. Errors, system crashes, etc. I give this one star because as a copier and standalone fax it works fine. The software is abysmal, atrocious, etc., and I tried to get help on their website which is hopeless and then they take over 24 hours to respond to emails with no real help. I have a HP 4M+ which has been 100% reliable for ten years so I thought I was safe to stick with HP, but apparently they think in order to compete they have to churn out junk and then run and hide."
2,Overly Simplistic,"I was expecting much more from this book. After reading an exerpt on the web called ""giving and receiving"" I was inspired to buy a copy and read it through. Unfortunately, the exerpt was the best part of the book, sort of like a movie preview that reveals too much."
4,Streamlight 45113 LiteBox Standard System 20-Watt Flood Bulb,Flood OK for lighting a small room but you may want a spot for longer distance.
5,A gift for your Soul!,"As a frequent Amazon shopper I enjoy reading reviews. Those before mine inspired me to take another chance and buy this book. I seem to be a metaphysical book junky. But this book was the greatest book I've bought in years. It contains so much wisdom that one, two or three readings will not be enough. I was finally at a stage where I could ""accept"" the messages it contains and it has transformed my long held attitudes and beliefs. For that I am very grateful to the author! Thank you for sharing such wisdom via Bartholomew! Wonderful! Love IS the answer....."
2,I Truly Know Why Prince Went On His Own,"Somebody was trying to make some money off of Prince's name when they decided to release this CD. Yeah, it's Prince - but it's not the Prince we all know and love. It is understandable why this wasn't released at the time it was recorded. I doubt if Prince had any involvement with the official release of these recordings anyway."
5,HARD TO FIND COLLECTORS MANUALS FOR AVIATION BUFFS,"THIS IS THE REAL THING, A BOEING 727 Flight Operations Manual step by step Prcedures for Commercial Aviation. This historic Pan Am Manual is rare to see, but excellent for Sim training, terminology and procedures for the advanced Commercial Pilot, It acts both as a reference and as a tool, can be added to any History of Aviation Library. Excellent Find."
4,A good supplemental reader,"This book, if used properly, adds much to the breadth and study of American history. This book contains primary documents, including images and pictures, to give the reader a deeper view and a more personal sense of how events in history have shaped this nation and its people."
1,Terrible film,"Worst film I have seen, pooly done, not worth the momney. I would not buy it, I want a refund"
2,"Serious and ""important"" = depressing and trite","A very disappointing collection of short films. The director says that these are ""important"" stories, but I just found most of them to be depressing and way too caught up in how clever they were trying to be."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Dont buy this DVD unless you are a hard core fan of gay themed movies and short stories. I was hopeful when I bought this DVD but was disappointed when I watched it. The acting is bad and I know that the budget was only $10,000, but the camera work could use some work. I think that maybe if these stories were retold but with a better budget and better actors then maybe it would make more of an impact. If I could I would give this a 1/2 star. I have watched other movies that were low budget but were still very powerful. I think maybe the director should have waited until he could scrounge up some more money. Next time hopefully he will learn from his mistakes."
2,False advertising,"I don't think this book is really ""step up from a collegiate dictionary"" It's basically a collegiate dictionary combined with a thesaurus. The dictionary section is 1789 pages and has 18 to 30 entries per page. That works out to about 40,000 entries. That's actually somewhat fewer than the typical collegiate dictionary. On the cover, it claims to have ""More than 200,000 entries and definitions."" It seems to me that this is false advertising. Of course, a dictionary that really had 200,000 entries would take up most of my desk space, so it's probably a good thing that it doesn't really have that many entries."
2,second edition inferior to first edition!,"The first edition published in 1995 combines Concise Oxford Dictionary with Oxford Thesaurus, has 1892 pages; 190,000 definitions, 300,000 synonyms and 50 pages of appendices. The second edition published in 2007 is based on Compact Oxford Dictionary(3rd edition) and Pocket Oxford Thesaurus, has only 1204 pages; 140,000 definitions, 240,000 synonyms and 44 pages of word finder in the centre pages."
2,hmmm...probably not,Bought this for a carnival themed party to use as footage to play on big screens but the quality was really terrible and it looks like its from the 70's. It is informative but randomly will show scenes that look like they come from a cheesy porn...it is informative and it explains how the carnival runs rules and such but it looks like an amatuer shot it and definitely not PG.
2,Under powered,"I bought this saw over a 16"" Husky and now I regret it. I brought it home, read the manual, inspected the saw as instructed filled it up with gas and bar oil and fired it up. It started very easily and ran smoothly. However, as soon as I began cutting I realized this saw is way under powered. I was cutting up a tree that fell in the ice/wind we had the other day. It was a soft wood tree, no locust, no oak. The base of the tree is about 12 inches in diameter. The saw would make it a few inches into the tree and bog down. Even on some of the larger branches it struggled. It also stalled every time I released the throttle from full throttle. It does start back up easily though. I will be taking this saw back and exchanging it for a Husky."
4,Satisfied,I needed a more powerful saw than my present one and this fulfilled the need perfectly. It's a good starter.
4,Very good for the money,I have had this saw for several months. It runs well and has been reliable. It will generally start in about 5 pulls hot or cold. The plastic gear for the chain adjustment does bother me a bit. Yes it works but if it was made from metal I would feel so much better about it. That being said I have already ordered a couple of extras at $5 each it is cheap insurance. With a sharp chain the saw does everything it is asked. It runs very smooth with little vibration and little noise. I can operate it for hours with out ear protection and it is light enough that your arms are not soar do to weight. All in all it is a fine saw for a typical home owner who cuts a few cords a year or general work around the house or farm. It is not a professional saw but if you are a professional you wouldn't be looking at this saw anyway. If there is any complaint I have it would be that it seems to go through bar and chain oil at almost the same speed as gas.
2,low power,"I purchased this item based on price and the size of the engine. It seems underpowered. I cut down a couple of boxelder trees, and wasn't very impressed."
3,Poulan Needs More Quality Control,"The Chainsaw was complete and everything was good until I went to use it. Out of the box it's performance is lacking. The carburetor is not adjusted properly.... the saw dies if you try to run it at full throttle. Their offer to ""... take it to a service center..."" is not acceptable when you live miles from one. Fortunately I have the skills and experience to fix it. But, one shouldn't have to do any repairs to a new product to use it. I've read several reviews of people experiencing carburetor problems and hard starting... more effort toward Quality Control at the factory would solve the problem of incorrect carburetor adjustment."
1,Two Uses,"I had a tree go down in my back yard about three years ago, and so I purchased the Poulon Pro PP4218AV. The chainsaw worked well the first time I used the saw. About three years later, I had another tree fall down in the back yard and when I was about halfway finished with the tree, I heard a rattling sound in the engine, as if a piece in the engine had broken off. I cannot pull the choke out at all, and when I pull on the start cord, I hear the broken piece rattling around in the engine. Poulan only warranties the saw for two years, so I guess I am out of luck. I have to say I am extremely dissapointed that I only got two uses out of the saw."
1,"Poulan 3314"" 14"" Chain Saw","I bought this item from a True Value Hardware affiliate who could not help in getting it serviced. The saw was almost impossible to start right out of the box. I took it back and they got it started and told me it would get easier after breaking in. It never did. I took it to a authorized Poulan dealer who charged me $35.00 to evaluate it. The problem was that it would not start easily and when I put it on its side to put more bar oil in it, the brake started smoking. Poulan said it was not their problem and the Repair facility said it would cost $175.00 to repair a $129.00 saw. I am maintaining that this saw was defective right out the box, and I suggest very strongly in not buying this product. It was JUNK! The Customer support from Poulan was also horrible. I would never recommend this company to anybody from this perspective and with problems I have seen from their Weedeater brand."
4,Good for the money!,"I bought this saw to bring down a couple of 14'' trees around my property and keep things trimmed. I am very familiar with two stroke engines and the like and found this easy to start and use with reasonable power.I have rented all sorts of stihls etc. They are nicer saws than this but then again they cost a lot more. This is not a pro level tool. It is obviously not meant to drop multiple cords of wood, day in and day out. If you look at many of the comments here you see that people are trying to get far to much from this saw, why? They are cheap and figured that an inexpensive $150 dollar saw could and should do the work of a $600.00 dollar one. They are ignorant as how to start and use a small two stroke gas engine i.e. if you run this thing full out for 15 minutes you are undoubtedly going to seize it up etc.For what it was meant to do it does very well, keep that in mind and buy a tool commensurate with the size of the work you have at hand."
5,No problems,"After reading other reviews I almost sent this back without opening the box. I'm really glad I didn't. I did not have one problem with his saw. I mixed the gas as per instructions. Started right up, kept running. Chain never slipped off. Shut it down to haul brush, didn't need to choke it, started right up never stalled, chain stayed sharp cutting maple. Been using saws for 30 years. The anti vibration feature is great. Don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. Mix the fuel properly, don't let the chain hit the dirt. I must have the best saw of the batch. Would recommend to anyone and would buy another in a heartbeat. Also, amazon had best value!"
2,Poorly designed,"Have had this saw for about a year, used frequently for everything from brush clearing to cutting down good size trees.The good:Saw starts reliably, haven't had any issues.The bad: The ""Tool less"" Chain adjustment doesn't keep the chain tight. For the first year it did fine, but recently it goes from tight to throwing the chain off in about 5 minutes of use.The saw is underpowered. I don't think this saw should ship with a 18"" bar. It doesn't seem to handle the length well, and it's normal for the saw to bog down and stop on anything bigger than small limbs.Poor fit of parts... I have had to take to carrying a pair of vice grips to get the gas cap off. I'm not strong enough to do it by hand (I'm a big guy too). Seems like the part is just designed poorly.All in all, I'd spend the extra cash and buy a dealer serviceable saw for a few extra bucks. You're going to have to eventually anyway. I'm going to the Stihl dealer in the morning."
2,Poulan Experience,"I've used Poulans for over 30 years. My old ones were getting hard to start when warm so I bought a new Poulan Pro 18"" gas. It is a fair machine for the occassional user for vertical cuts but it is worthless for horizontal cuts. If you cut a stump or trim a hedge, anything with a horizontal cut, it throws the chain off. The worse part is that it burrs up the chain guides and they have to be filed individually so the chain fits back in the bar track again. I tried a couple different brands of chains and it's the same problem. I tried overtightening the chain and still the same problem. This did not occur even once in 30 years with my old Poulan saws. I would not recommend this saw until Poulan addresses this problem."
1,Very disappointed,"Purchased Poulan Pro PP4218AVX 18-Inch 42cc 2-Cycle Gas-Powered Anti-Vibration Chain Saw with Case. Mixed 2 Cycle oil with gas as instructed. Started first time, made a couple of test cuts worked fine. Started 2nd time fine, but after only 2 hours of use, would not start. Took it to a Poulan dealer paid 35.00 for inspection and estimate, scored cylinder, more to repair than to replace. NOT HAPPY AT ALLPoulan Pro PP4218AVX 18-Inch 42cc 2-Cycle Gas-Powered Anti-Vibration Chain Saw with Case"
4,good value for the money,"I bought this 8+ years ago for light duty, and hardly used it at all. Times have changed, and find myself living in the great northwest, up to my ankles in snow, freezing my arse off. I thought this saw was going to be a throw away, as over time it would barely start, hardly run, and had trouble cutting much of anything. I didn't give up. Several hours a day, over a month plus, after learning to sharpen the chain this saw is getting it done. I've used the pro stihl saws, and have no illusions about this saws abilities, or lack of... But this saw can do it. If you don't make a living selling cords of wood or mill lumber with a chainsaw this is a good beginner to intermediate saw, that will go far. I now expect this saw to keep my home heated for many years."
2,2 stars is being generous,Impossible to saw 1-2 inch saplings for more than two or three minutes without stopping to tighten or put chain back on bar after it slips off. I would not buy this saw or for that matter another Poulan.
1,Never Again.,"Have been using/owning chainsaws for 40+ years. Worst ever. Follow all directions EXACTLY, Easy first start, runs fine 'till warmed up, then dies. Won't restart 'till it cools down. Shopping for replacement now."
5,A good saw for the homeowner.,This is the 3rd Poulan chain saw that I have owned over the past 25 years. It is relatively inexpensive and does the job for me.
1,don't waste your time,"We bought this product to do yard work. It was a very hard start from the beginning. The second time using it, the motor seized up & a wire melted. Now we are trying to deal with Poulan's customer service. After over a month of trying to get it fixed (it has a 2 year warranty), we have gotten no where (unless you count the huge run around we are getting!) Pretty sad when their own customer service department hangs up on an upset customer! Even the service centers on their web site won't touch the saw for warranty work!!!"
4,"Poulan 42cc 18"" Chainsaw","Used this saw for several hours to cut down an oak tree.Although the tree was much too large for the saw (36"" diameter, the saw cut into it quickly and cleanly. It has enough power for up to maybe 24"" diameter trunks. The blade seemed a little flimsy (it flexed easily while buried in the trunk) but, like I said I was cutting too much tree."
4,light to moderate duty - good deal,"If you're logging a 40, this is probably not your saw. But, it does have features of saws double the price. Great for cutting firewood and felling small trees. durability? TBD... planning to use as manufacturer designed ; moderately."
1,Absolute Garbage,"After very little use around the house, the motor locked up. After reading these reviews, it looks like I'm not the first one to throw one away for this reason."
4,Works very well for the price,"Great saw for the price. Great value for the occasional user.Works well for occasional use at this price point. Well made, started for the first time on the second pull and then at the first or second pull every time after. Cut through red oak without much of a problem until the logs got over 12 inches across then the low torque became apparent and you had to stop pushing and just let the weight of the saw cut through. I liked the tool free chain tension feature. Altogether an excellent product for the homeowner, if you need to cut large logs frequently though do yourself a favor and buy a better quality (read more expensive) saw."
2,POOR,"Cuts well when it runs, the problem is it is hard to keep running. The idle adjustments are covered to prevent user adjustments so you have to pay to have a shop do it. I will not buy anything Poulan after this. I will pay more and stick with Echo or Stihl."
2,You get what you pay for...,"It's a cheap saw at a cheap price.I bought the Craftsman equivalent (same saw, different color)You can liven it up by adding holes (two 3/8"" or four 1/4"") in thefront of muffler cover and then richen up the mixture screws a bit(1/4 turn out from factory setting is a good start)http://racesaws.com/index.php?referrerid=1839The motor is fairly good and has decent power when allowed to breathe.But the chain oil pump will fail. It has a plastic gear which is prone to stripping. Parts are not expensive, but it takes time and a bit of knowledge to do the repair.If you want a cheap saw that works pretty well, this is one - but it willnot last for very long.If you want a quality saw that will last, go with Stihl or Husqvarna."
4,Good Saw for the Money,"I bought one of these saws from Lowe's. I got it home and started it - it immediately ""ran away"" to full speed with my hand nowhere near the throttle. Being a chainsaw newbie, I didn't really know what was going on so I engaged the blade brake. Haha, the clutch overheated to the point that smoke was billowing out of the thing and plastic started melting. So I took it back to Lowes and exchanged it for a new one.The new one started right up. After letting it warm up for half a minute I goosed the throttle and got a nice, smooth idle. I proceeded to fell a storm-damaged tree and chop it up - probably an hour and a half of run time. Saw worked great. Went right through a 15"" trunk with no bogging down. Chain tensioner is easy to use. No problems whatsoever.I'm a little concerned about some reviews here so I'm really considering taking it back and getting a Husqvarna, but it really does seem like a good saw for the money."
2,sad...changed my review,This is our second Poulan chainsaw. Someone stole my other one last year from the back of my truck when I stopped to get a cup of coffee after cutting down our Christmas Tree. We were heartbroken. I have changed my review because it is the 2nd one that doesn't work after a few months. The repair shop keeps saying the carberator is messed up....we spent extra and got a more expensive brand...can't afford to pay the money and no chain saw after a couple of months....tooo BAD...I love the features and how easy it started. Won't buy another.
1,Very Poorly Built and Dangerous,"I purchased this chainsaw when I noticed all of the features it had for the price of about $150.00 When I first pulled it out of the box, I noticed the front cowling was broken, this did not affect the use of the saw, just the looks, so I put it together and got it running. I started fairly well, but liked to bog down near full throttle. I used it to cut up some dry cedar that had fallen and saw that it was throwing sparks from the wood as soon as it touched, the blade was very dull, right out of the box. No matter how tight I got the bar nuts, they would not stay that way and the blade would loosen and fall off randomly. I feel this saw is dangerous and very poorly made, I took mine back paid the extra money and got a trusty old Swede."
3,"When there were none to be found, it worked.","I bought this chainsaw online after the October storm when you couldn't find a saw anywhere for 150 miles. That being said, this saw performed well for the price. My husband found the vibration to be average, so I don't see where you could call it an anti-vib saw. It also seems to blow thru chain oil, but that could be an adjustment that we couldn't find and my husband's inexperience with this brand, and saws in general. Getting it started the first time, was tricky, but once you get it, its really not that difficult. All in all, its a decent saw for the money."
1,Not recommended,"I bought this saw from one of the big box stores and after two months of light use (firewood, trimming trees, etc.) I had the same pull cord problem that a previous reviewer had. The pull cord would not retract. I took apart the housing and tightened and loosened the screw holding the pull cord assembly together to try and get the cord to retract properly to no avail. I take very good care of all my outdoor equipment so I have to assume this is just bad design/quality. I'll be trying to get it replaced under warranty but based on the experience others others have had with Poulan customer service it looks like I may be buying a Stihl from a local dealer."
1,You can do better,"I bought a Poulan because of the price. Bad idea. You do get what you pay for. After a year of light use, starting it got very hard. Once it did start, it would run for a minute or two, stall out, and then could not be started until it was fully cooled down. I took it for service at a small engine shop I know and trust. When I went to pick it up, the mechanic told me he couldn't do much with it because the carb has very limited adjustability. He said the only fix would be a new carb, which he would not recommend because of cost, and because I would probably encounter the same problem again."
1,Not a good choice!,"I purchased the saw because of price and once again got burned.After 2 months the saw became very hard to start. I brought the saw into a dealer, who indicated that it needed carburator work. The saw has been there for over 3 months now. I had to buy another saw to get my work done, while waiting for this one to be fixed.I called Poulan and they are not helpful at all. They just tell me that it should be fixed soon. I thought that after all this time, that if the saw can't be fixed, it should be replaced. But they didn't see the wisdom in that line of thought.All I can say is buyer beware!!"
1,"There are few things in this world I hate more than this ""saw""","The words I want to use to describe this saw should never be written in a public domain. They are the words I mutter and sometimes yell (when I am sure I am out of earshot) whenever I am forced to use this piece of garbage. It is always hard to start. If I adjust the chain too tight it binds, too loose it fall off. There doesn't seem to be a correct adjustment (believe me, after putting the chain back on a few dozen times I have tried everything). I truly hate this product and feel sorry for anyone who buys one. Do yourself a favor - spend 300 bucks (or lots more, of course) and get a good saw. I can't really afford it right now, but I can't really afford not to, either. Time is money and this horrible instrument of mental torture will cost you lots of time."
1,Spending more time working on it than using it.,"My father-in-law had one and returned it to the big box store it came from. When the second one didn't work he returned it for cash and bought a high-end something-or-other. I figured it was just that he had bad luck. It just looked like a great and easy to use chain saw for a great price so I bought one anyway. After running it maybe 2 hours over 20 starts, the rope will not pull back in. I've taken it apart and tried some dry lube but then found that some plastic piece in there is wearing and isn't fitting tight over the spring any more.I doubt I can find a receipt to get it fixed under warranty - and am not sure I care to fix it anyway. I'm headed to the mower shop next week to get a real chain saw."
1,Poor Choice - Inferior Product,"After a short time of use, the engine would not idle, even after adjustments recommended in the owner's manual. Won't restart until the engine is cooled. Makes it almost impossible to accomplish any work with this performance. Now the rewind starter is jammed and won't operate. This is a new saw and based on my experience I would never purchase this product again. My saw is junk, at best. Spend a few extra dollars and get a saw that is built stronger and will cause less trouble."
2,Starter cord won't rewind,I have the same problem as other users - after a year of occasional use the starter cord won't rewind. I like the chain tension adjuster and it seems to have ok power but if you can't crank it -- well you get the idea.
2,Don't Do It,"Buy a known brand, and from the local hardware store. Note the return policy on items that use gas. I wish I would have heeded the advice of other reviewers. I liked the saw at first. It has a few things different from what I am used to, such as the way the chain is tightened, which is pretty nice. I cut up a few fallen tree stumps, then the chain came off. Easy enough, figured out the tightening thing, start it back up and the chain is locked up by the protector piece. The spring jumped out of place and now requires re-compression and to be put back in place. All this after five minutes of use and hours of trying the fix the XXXX thing."
5,smooth,this does what you expect it to do and dos it smoothly and quick. Was extremely happy with its preformance
3,"Problems cutting after a few uses, and chain replacement.","I bought one of these saws a couple of years ago, and it worked great initially. I use it infrequently to cut up fallen limbs, trim my trees, and have cut down about a 12"" tree without problems. After I cut down the tree the saw started to lose cutting efficency and smoke. I replaced the chain, but it still does not cut like the new saw. I have ordered a bar and chain since the bar may have been damaged, but am disppointed if the bar is that easy to damage or wear out. It looks straight, but worried the bearings for the chain end sprocket may be bad. The engine still runs fine and not sure what else could be causing the problem. (My brother keeps telling me I might have the chain on backwards, but that was the first thing I checked.)Maybe just replacing the bar and chain is the fix, but wish there was an easier way to determine the problem."
2,Two stars tops,"Not quite a 1 star item, but no more than two. I bought this as an only option after the 2005 hurricanes and used it occasionally to keep the trees in my yard trimmed and cutting up the branches I trim. This is a good short-term, temporary saw if that's what you need. Not too many hours after use, mine wouldn't stay running after it was warm. Checked the air filter and replaced the plug, and still nothing. Finally last year, after very light yearly use, it would no longer start. I even tried replacing all of the fuel hoses and filter with a kit I bought, but none of that worked. The old saying is true: Buy cheap, buy twice."
2,"poulan 40"" chain saw. DEFECTIVE???","The product did not meet my specs, the chain saw only worked one time and after five (5) minutes of use the saw would not cut anymore. I don't know what is wrong and it probably cost too much to return it. I am going to buy another chain to see if that is the problem. However. that will probably cost me a lot too. I also have had a problem in obtaining the case for the chain saw. the company keep saying that they will send the case but nothing happens. I will not buy from that company again."
2,It cuts but Poulan support is cut-throat.,"My main complaint is that I lost a nut (through normal chainsaw vibration) while cutting a palm tree. This is one of two identical flange nuts that hold the plastic clutch housing cover and the chain bar in place. The instruction manual does not specify the size of the nuts & I thought it may be 5/16 inch. I called their 1-800-554-6723 number and they could not tell me the size but offered to send me one for $9 shipping. Therefore, at Home Depot I bought 2 5/16 inch nuts, 1 with 18 thread and the other with 24 thread. Neither one would go in. It appears that it may be a metric size (perhaps 8mm). I have now ordered from BoltsDepot.com 8mm & 10 mm nuts hoping that they will work. I think it is sickening to see how Poulan rips-off its customers. Stay away from this chain saw, find a brand that supports its customers in a reasonable manner."
1,"Spend the money, get a decent one.",Bought the Poulan Pro 18 inch 42cc 2 cycle Gas-Powered anti vibration chain saw with case a month ago for $149.00 and used it three times. That's $49.66 for each use. Have not been able to use it in two weeks because it is in the shop being worked on. Won't start. Spend a little more money and get a decent saw.
1,Poulan Pro,Chain Saw does not work.Chain Saw arrived on time but it had gas in it and oil in it.The chain Saw would not start at all.
1,terrible chain saw,"This was a terrible chain saw! right out of the box it smoked, wouldn't stay running, was hard to restart, and had no power. I got a refund from Amazon, because I didn't want the saw."
1,I hate this saw,"I don't know how much I can say this. I've had this saw for two years now. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this saw. Here's why:1. The chain is either too tight or it is IMPOSSIBLE to prevent in from falling off. You cut 6 or 7 cuts, put the chain on again, and it falls off again. F R U S T R A T I N G!2. The gas cap swells and is IMPOSSIBLE to get on correctly after a couple of years. Google it. you'll see all sorts of people who have the same problem. You have to use a rotary tool to sand down the cap to get in on. Awesome.Every time I use it I want to throw it across the yard. Other than that, it's fine."
1,Should be ZERO stars!!!!,"Purchased this saw less than a year ago, and wished I hadn't wasted my money. This saw has been frustrating to use since the day I pulled it out of the box. First thing, who designed the gas and oil caps? I never could get them to go on properly. always leaked. Second, once you have the saw started, don't take your hand off the trigger or it will die. Spent more time trying to get this saw to start than using it to cut. The best this about this saw was wrapping it around a tree this morning before going to buy an Echo."
4,Seymour Firewood Stack-it Brackets,"Timely arrival, easy assembly, good instructions.All in all, a very useful purchase. I ordered two more.Best to use PT 2X4's on bottom, I believe."
4,Good product that is a time saver,"Would have received 5 stars, but the fabrication and coating of these is not as high quality as I was expecting. Overall, they work well and fit the pressure treated lumber. However, there were several scratches to the finish, and I had to bend a few into the correct shape. Thankfully, they will not be used outdoors, so I am not as worried about corrosion."
5,firewood stacking,these make constucting a firewood stacking system very easy and they seem to last for years - great product !!
2,Disappointing,There are other better options out there. This was sort of a hassle to put together. I would not order this again or recommend it.
4,"Does the job--and inexpensive, too!","These brackets work. They are easy to set up and can be moved when you need to. Leave a couple inches from the ends of the 2x4s...otherwise the brackets might slide off. But once set up, they are rock solid and tough. I like also that you can use basically any length 2x4 so they are very versatile."
2,Ehhh,"Not so bad but, not that easy of a set up. The plastic ones are a bit more easy to use. These are good for custom size stuff"
4,Excellent quick fix,The Seymour Stack-It brackets work as advertised and are a decent bargain. I created 16 foot by 4 foot high log racks with them and they are holding up well.
5,These are great and well worth the money!,"My husband said these are really easy to assemble. He used lag bolt, a wrench, green treated lumber and a circular saw and had these put together in no time. We made 4 sets of racks each with 16 foot length boards for the bottoms and one bracket each end of the board and one half way for the mid support upright board. They will certainly be easy to move around when the wood is used up so we can clean under them and I really like how the wood is not on the ground. One reviewer wrote that the pieces were a little larger than the lumber causing them to shim the wood but we didn't have this situation and infact we needed to slightly shave one piece of wood to get it to fit. Otherwise, the wood fit nicely. I would say this metal is perfectly heavy duty for this project and appears to be well coated for the elements. You didn't ask but Yes, I would recommend this to a friend! :)"
3,Please do not overpay for this game....,This game is available at CompUSA for $9.99 BRAND NEW. Do not pay the astronomical prices that people are offering this game for. I saw one person listed the game for $69.99! This is shameful. There seems to be a misconception that this title is not available in the U.S. IT IS!
2,Did WWF Wrestlemania X8 live up to the hype?,HELL NO!But I guess the card is better because of the crowdRob Van Dam over William Regal-**Diamond Dallas Page over Christian-*Goldust and Maven went to a no contest-DUDKurt Angle over Kane-**Undertaker over Ric Flair-***Edge over Booket T-*Steve Austin over Scott Hall-*Billy and Chuck won a Fatal 4 Way-*The Rock over Holly Hogan-**Jazz over Lita and Trish Stratus-DUDTriple H over Chris Jericho-**DIdnt live up to the hype and very dissapointed with almost every match besidesd Tkaer/Flair.
3,okay but wm 19 will be better,this wrestlemania was okay but it didnt have very much action in it. the main event for the undisputed championship was way predictible and the rock vs. hogan match was dumb. wrestlemania 19 will be proven to be the best wrestlemania ever including the Rock vs. Goldberg match. I cant wait to see the rock get speared and jackhammered. Also Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar in a really wrestling match so we will get to see what is better winning a gold medal for wrestling or being an NCAA champion. so you can either get this okay dvd or you can wait until an awesome wrestlemania comes out. take my advice i'm right.p.s. I will be at wrestlemania 19 in seattlesee ya
2,3 Matches do not a PPV make,"Obviously the selling point of this video is Hogan-Rock, which is one of the biggest matches of all time. Kane-Kurt Angle, and Steve Austin-Scott Hall are pretty good matches too. HOWEVER, the heatless boring ""main event"" between HHH and Chris Jericho, and LOTS of pointless HEAT-level filler make for a very bland, uninspired show. WWF, er E has really gone downhill since last year's excellent Wrestlemania X-7, and this show is proof of that."
4,hogan vs rock,This should be a great dvd...but be warned!The WWF has not said if they plan to edit thecrowd noise during the Hogan vs Rock match.On the replay following the live ppv...they editedthe match with just cheering for Hogan AND Rock.All the booing and jeers for the Rock had beentaken out. I fear they may do this for the dvd releaseas well. Be forewarned.
2,WHAT A LET DOWN!,"This was the worst Wrestlemania i have ever seen. There was no effort put into any of the matches (other than flair vs undertaker). Hogan vs Rock was a big letdown in my opinion, they stared at eachother for longer than goldberg vs lesnar, and goldberg vs lesnar was more interesting to watch than this crap yet everyone cheered it. and then there is the main event, now triple h is my favourite wrestler, but his performance was terrible. The only good thing about this match is there is two pedigrees. The only reason this event gets two stars is because of the flair vs undertaker match. That match is something you would have to see to believe, the greatest superplex of all time was in that match.So do yourself a favour and DO NOT!! waste your money on this crap. If you want a good wrestlemania get either 19 or 20 those were much better than this."
3,"Good, but by no means great.","The highlight was The rock v Hulk Hogan. This match was good but for all the hype it should have been better. Apart from this match the rest was average. Undertaker v Flair was dull and full of mistakes, Angle v Kane was good but a rubbish finish. The live band, Saliva, did nothing to help an already quiet crowd. Massive crowd reaction for the Hulk meant that the WWE title match between HHH and Jericho had little affect. Overall an OK event, but don't be fooled by the hype, Wrestlemania X8 was not ""the biggest extravaganza of all time."""
5,"The best Wrestlemania EVER!, but a disappointing DVD","This is simply the best Wrestlemania of all time. Period. The simple fact of seeing Hulkamania rise again was very emotional. Every single WWF fan MUST own this PPV. The card was good (except for the Austin vs. nWo match). and the crowd reaction was simply amazing. And that's a good thing!The bad thing is that this DVD is a dissapointment. Wreslemania 2000 came in a 2-disc set including Wrestlemania history, the Spanish commentary (very funny) and other extras. Wrestlemania X-Seven also came in a 2-disc set with a few extras (but no Spanish commentary). This DVD has no extras, at least they should include the Raw after Wrestlemania, exclusive interviews with the wrestlers, the WWF Desire clips and the Spanish commentary...I give 5 stars just for the PPV alone. It is worth the purchase."
3,Can't Touch Wrestlemania X-7 By Far,"This Overall was a decient PPV seeing how its Wrestlemania I expected a LOT more. The Highlight of the night would be the Rock vs. Hogan match Only becuase of the fan reaction. Hogan hets cheared sooo loud while the Rock gets boooed out of the building. The rest of the PPV was ok not worth 40 bucks on PPV. Overall Buy it becuase1. Huge pop for hogan vs. Rock2. 68,276 Fans3. D-von getting thrown off the top rope through a table on the outside of the ring he lands wierd and looks like he was seriousley injured.4. RVD Getting dropped on his head and yelling DROPKICK. ( watch the match carefully and you can hear him say the move so loud before he does it.CONS1. No T.L.C, HELL IN A CELL, STREET FIGHT or any great matches like last years mania.2. Very bad performences from salivia and drowining pool.3. Worst Main Event Ever HHH VS. jERICHO.4. Boring matchesWELL all in all 3 out of 5 aint bad better luck next year"
1,Don't buy it,WrestleMania 18 was stupid. Worst ppv I have ever seen. WrestleMania XIX best ppv I have ever seen. You can buy WM 18 but it doesn't even come close to WrestleMania XIX.
1,WrestleMania x8?? WrestleMania XIX!!,Wrestlemania x8 was okay. but it didn't compare to WrestleMania XIX. You can buy x8 but why buy when you have WrestleMania XIX to buy instead.
1,I gave up watching wrestling because of this....,"This card is the highlight film of what is wrong with the WWF today. Being a fan of the likes of Chris Benoit - this ""show"" made me sick to my stomach. Hogan should have stayed retired - and done the world a favor. ... I had no problems with the other matches on the card - but to see Hogan again taking the spotlight, knocked this rating down several stars.... ... Nothing the Rock could've done, would've saved things. Not even a miracle worker like Benoit would be able to restore life into Hogan's tired act."
3,wrestlebore,"This is one of the boringest wrestlemanias I have seen. I have seen every wrestlemania and own them all! This event was only built on one match which was Hogan vs. the Rock which is the best match on the card. Hall vs Stone Cold was one of the worst match that I have seen that involed stone cold. The mian event was weak too. Everybody knew that triple h was going to win.All the matches on the card was terriable. This was the first wrestlemania that I didn't watch on pay-per-view, I waited for it to come out on dvd. If you haven't seen this one I suggest you rent it first. Everybody has a diffent taste."
3,Good Wrestlemania,"1st RVD vs Regal for I.c Titlegood opener,Rvd wins I.C title 8/102nd Maven vs Goldustwhat a hardcore match, 5 peaple wins a loses it. 8/103rd Edge vs BookerTgood match Edge wins his 3 Wrestlemania in a row 8/104th Kane vs Kurt Angleanother great match somehow Kurt one 7/105th Undertaker vs Ric Flairthis match was long and bloody Arn Anderson spines buster Undertaker but he still won 7/106th Stone Cold vs Scott Hallin the words on Jr what a slobber knocker, Austins stuns Scott 5ft in the air 8/107th Hardyz vs APA vs Dudleyz vs Billy/Chuckgood match but Billy/Chuck keeps the titles 7/108th The Rock vs Hoganbest match of the night Rock kicks out of the leg drop.

3,Not what it should be,"While there have been quiet a few worse Wrestlemanias this show fails to live up to the hype. Edge and Booker should have been fighting over a title and not a ""Japanese shampoo commercial"".The Triple H / Jericho match was one of the most boring main events ever. The Hogan / Rock match lived up to all it should be and the surprise crowd reaction is unbelivable. The etras make this DVD worth it though."
3,"OK, but.......",The DVD is ok. You get the PPV obviously. There are some extras. But if you watched the WrestleMania Classics show on TNN the week of Wrestlemania back in March.......then you have seen 90% of the extras. The other 10% is some stuff the WWF showed on EXCESS on TNN or on WWF.com BYTE THIS. And it has 4 or 5 interviews with mid-card superstars right after there match that isn't must see tv.
4,Not hyped enough,"Yeah, I know WrestleMania was hyped, but not compared to WrestleMania X7. Remember the huge build-ups to EVERY match? The only matches hyped this year were Rock vs. Hogan, Hall vs. Austin, Taker vs. Flair, and HHH vs. Jericho. I'm sorry but I did not buy the PPV for any of those matches. What about the Four Corners Tag Team Match, or Booker T vs. Edge, or the Triple Threat Women's Title Match, or Kurt Angle vs. Kane, or William Regal vs. RVD, or even DDP vs. Christian? These matches all contained great competitors. I, for one, was looking forward to the women's division finally become a competitive division. With Mighty Molly, Ivory, Lita, Trish Stratus, and Jazz there's no reason the division can't become great. And it would've had WWF built up to this match. Anyways, the only extremely great matches in my opinion were Hogan vs. Rock, Angle vs. Kane, & the Triple Threat Women's Title match. The main event was horrid! ...."
5,great wrestlemania,"all the matches were good, even the womans matchi noticed in almost every match there were some kind of mistakesfunniest one *maven missing a dropkick*overall a good ppv, i saw it on vhs but i woudl rather see it on dvd"
3,Wrestle Mania 18,Well lets see here this is the 18th WrestleMania for the WWF now known as WWE which sounds really dumb..and the main event was Triple H v. Chris Jericho for the Undisputed Championship and they advertise Rock v. Hogan and that wasnt even the main event ..now c'mon dont u think the Hogan and Rock match shoulda been the main event if they advertised it more...but oh well..over all the PPV was ok a few borin matches couple dumb band performances to waste time but this wasnt good enough to be a Wrestle Mania if u wanna watch a wrestle mania buy X-7...or 10 sumthin like that...
2,"Not nearly the best WM ever, but not the worst.","I don't really know why everyone gave Wrestlemania 18 such great reviews. IMO, it was very bland. The Hogan vs. Rock match [was] really bad. The only reason it seemed good was because of the crow reaction. If you muted the t.v. when you watch that match you will see it in a different light. I can't really name one single good match on the entire card. The only reason I bought the DVD is because of the historical value. I just wish that the WWE would just stop with the whole Hogan as the champion thing. It really bugs me a lot. Oh yeah, to all of you little MARKS out there, stop saying that this is the best WM of all time. Check out WM 3, 10, 14, and 17."
2,rock and hogan is like rocky vs superman 2 me by Joe Brown,Da Rock vs Hollywood Hoganentertaing wise this match is a ****+ rating but match wise this match is around a ** rating but u have hogan n da match so i wasn't expecting a ***** masterpiece but with da rock n da match before goin 2 Hollywood 4 good anything was possible i will never forget when da rock asked hogan 4 da match at wm 18 that was one of da highlight moments of wrestling history and one of my favorite moments of my life because it was 2nd of my favs hogan was my favorite wrestling n da 1990s and da rock was my favorite wrestler n da 2000s n da same ring face 2 face it was wrestling at its best
3,Lackluster Wrestlemania.....,"First off, heading into the event truly only one match was pushed and that of course is Hulk Hogan vs The Rock, the buildup for that match was good, but the rest of the card fills like filler. Most of the matches were just thrown together and had no buildup what so ever. Also the Hogan-Rock showdown is a little overrated, true the crowd heat was off the charts, the actual match is pretty boring with alot of stalling. Worse, the world title match between Triple H and Chris Jericho was hardly pushed at all and there is NO crowd heat at all during the match. Overall this felt more like an extended version of Raw or Smackdown then a Wrestlemania and other than Hogan-Rock, nothing truly stands out as Wrestlemania worthy."
3,This was not one of the greatest WM's but it's pretty desent,This WM was not as good as the others. But it did have some great matchesGreatRVD vs. RegalIntercontinental ChampionshipGreat OpenerDDP vs. ChristianEuropean ChampionshipA good match. DDP's only WM apperanceAustin vs. HallGreat brawl. Loved this matchTag Team Turmoil MatchTag Team ChampionshipThis was one of my favorite matches on the card.HHH vs. JerichoUndisputed ChampionshipGreat Technical Match. Love what happens to Steph.The BadHogan vs. RockI don't see why rock should be in this match. It should have been Austin vs. Hogan. Stone Cold is more of an Icon than Rock. The Croud 100% Behind Hogan.Overall: This was a bad year for WWE. only a couple of PPV's were great. IT was an ok PPV
5,As good as any big-name pop/folk/country star around,"I don't know why this artist is not bigger than she is. Her songwriting and performance is top-notch. I'm not a big folk or country music fan, but I thoroughly enjoy listening to her fresh music. I hope more people can discover it."
1,not a good CD,She sang off key. Not a very good CD. I wish I could get my money back for it. 0 stars
4,Total silliness,"This book was such a fun read. I heard Danny Wallace interviewed on a local radio station and ordered the book later that same day. The story is just utter silliness but worth the read. At times I wondered why he was with his girlfriend and why these crazies kept joining when they had no idea what ""join me"" was. The vicar and Galactic guy had me howling with laughter. This is a light story that's very entertaining. I think anyone who thrives on spontaneity will love this book. Oh, and I will be sending in my passport photo, as soon as I can get one that doesn't make me look like I'm crazy too...."
1,another point of view,"All of the current reviews of this book are highly favorable with the exception of one which said it was ""okay"". Well, I have a different view. The author tried much too hard to be funny, took much too long to finally figure out a reason to have people join him (fully 100 pages), and the end result is BORING! There is nothing wrong with random acts of kindness, but one does not need to ""join"" anything in order to practice kindness. Just do it. Don't waste your time reading this pointless book."
4,Nothing else like it,"Join me is in a class all it's own. The whole basis of the book is that the author decides to start a ""collective"" out of the blue. He is unsure of what the ""collective"" will be about. It was interesting to read how Danny was going to pull this off. I found myself cheering him on when he was trying to reach his membership goals. I gave this book 4 stars because it does have a few tedious parts. Overall, though this book is laugh out loud funny."
3,Great idea for book -- mediocre execution,"I thought this would be a very interesting book and the premise was really engaging for the first 1/4 of the book. However, the author meanders around the rest of the book and doesn't tie the whole experience together."
1,Disappointed,"I usually appreciate English humor, but this time I was really disappointed. The author's attempts at humor did not even bring a smile to my face. I was curious about the story, but not enough to finish reading something that was written in such a boring way. I just stopped in the middle.Apart from that, I suppose I simply could not relate to a writer/character who is in his twenties and still thinks of himself as a boy, as he calls himself. I'm totally ok with a person getting out of his or her job and experimenting with creative things, or even feeling lost and not knowing what to do next. The real problem is that I cannot relate to the shallow person whose story I was trying to follow. I hope he became a deeper person along the way, but I just could not read anymore of that."
2,"NOT A SCREENPLAY, JUST A TRANSCRIPT","Being a big Kubrick fan, I was a bit disappointed. The screenplay seems to be more of a transcript than an actual draft used during the production. The pictures from the film are black and white and seemed stage (a little bit of Kubrick trivia: every production still from his movies was from the film itself, i.e. the actual film frame, but not some of the pictures in this book). The novel ""Dream Story"" and the typed credits were worth the price of the book alone for a Kubrick fanatic like me, though."
4,"""Shut"" falls a little short, but...","It's an enjoyable, quick read. Needs a larger variety of stills, and in color. Part of what made EWS so gorgeous was its use of color, which is ignored here. Also, one secret is divulged in the book that I'd rather not have known: what Leelee Sobieski's character whispers to Tom Cruise at the costume shop. My imagination was far more interesting!Good idea to include the original novel along with the screenplay. Makes for an easy study of the art of adaptation, which Kubrick was well versed at."
3,"Good Script, Terrible Book","While the screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Frederic Raphael seems to take us from Point A to Point B, it's very interesting and is a good, read. As it was Kubrick's final film, it was a good move of Warner Brothers to publish the script of it.The source novel of the film, ""Dream Story"" by Arthur Schnizler, has a lengthy, tedious and confusing narrative. It's almost unreadable and it's amazing how Kubrick enhanced the story and made it into one of the best films of the 20th Century.See the movie and purchase this book. It's well worth it if you're a fan of excellent, quality films and the good screenwriting that makes it."
2,The movie was awsome!!! But the book stinks!!,"The screenplay shoul defenitly have more description to it. It is a poor ""transcript"" of the movie, and i pity the one that has that taste.See the movie and you'll see what i'm talking about. Sooooo... much better it's scary!"
3,"Short, mysterious & unusual","I find the story satisfactory though am not highly impressed. I appreciate however the briefness & conciseness of the plot; & the screenplay which complements the Dream Story since it explains (or attempts to shed light) some vague & hanging scenes from the original novel.For all it is worth, I say it is interesting enough to let time pass, especially if you have a wild imagination & you come across the masquerade party."
2,TOO WEIRD,"The interesting thing about reading the screenplay and the story it was based on was seeing how Kubrick took the story and translated it into modern times and a different locale.The story itself, in both its screenplay and original short-novel form, isn't that good. It's too weird, and too shallow, and the conclusion doesn't make any sense.Perhaps it was Kubrick's legendary film-making that overcame those flaws. Having not seen the movie, I don't know. Readers, in my opinion, would be just as well to give this book a pass."
1,This Book Is Awful!!!,This is one of the most boring books I've ever read. Stick to the version without the screenplay... if you can find it.
4,Thanks,A timely receipt of a great class that I will use in my class. Thanks for your help with this.
4,A good product--but be careful!,"I've used the Orange Spice variety of this tea and I greatly enjoyed the flavor. After reading other reviews, I am glad to see that most people benefited from the tea, but I also want to add a word of warning. If you have a sensitive stomach(which I do), BE CAREFUL. I drank one cup of this tea on Thursday night and I am just starting to feel better on Saturday morning.Yes, it is an effective stomach/bowel cleanse, but I was literally in extreme pain at certain moments. If you do use this tea,stay near a bathroom and do not exceed the recommended dose levels!"
4,Great Product,"Great product, fast shipping! I was worried this tea wouldn't taste good, but I add 1 packet of Spelnda to mine & it's great! I love making iced tea out of it! Really helps to curb my appetite!"
2,JUST LIKE REGULAR GREEN TEA...,DIDN'T WORK FOR ME AS SLIMMING TEA...JUST LIKE REGULAR GREEN TEA...I DIDN'T LOOSE EVEN 1 POUND....I GIVE 3 STARS BECAUSE THE DELIVERY WAS FAST...
5,Excellent,"A flamenco guitar recording is difficult to do well. Either you get lost in techinically adept but artistically meaningless meanderings (even Paco de Lucia is guilty of this), or you get trapped in commercial flamenco-lite. This album avoids these traps and succeeds brilliantly. Very flamenco puro, a guest appearance by Camaron, and well-crafted temas that keep playing in your mind."
2,An outdated text and cases on production strategy,"I read this book long after its purchasing. Its text stuff is short (just a couple of papers from HBS) and a couple of ideas about the prospective role of production as part of the strategy function of any company and quality control management. All of it is very outdated. In adition, cases are not liable for selfstudy. So, Little profit is to be got from this book from selfstudy."
4,Good book with a lot of real life examples,"books in great condition, I already knew the content of the book because I used it for my college independent study. It has a lot of great information on how companies and factories can and should be ran."
1,Not Latin American Spanish,"Hugo Spanish Complete with six CDs and two books is for people who already have a basic knowledge of spanish and want to speak spanish as it is spoken in Spain, NOT as in Latin American. I live in Texas, I need a simple, basic, fast-paced course for Latin American spanish. I have not found one yet. Rosetta Stone is too expensive as you pay for their fancy advertising. Can anyone help me by suggesting a good course for Latin American spanish? This Hugo course would be good if it were not for use in Spain. There is a difference."
2,Spanish in 3 months,"There is no way you can learn Spanish in 3 months with this book! The book goes into too much grammar and there is not enough examples. If you are using this along side a teacher then it is fine, for someone on their own it is very difficult as the lessons go on because of the grammar. Also it is badly formated, there is stuff that one needs early on in the book not by week 5."
5,"rude, crude and very very f-f-f-funny!",Open All hours is quite literally one of the funniest television shows ever! Being British and from the north i can tell you that it doesn't get better than this. Stuttering Arkwright who is superbly played by Ronnie Barker in arguably his greatest ever role is the shop keeper from hell! his love for nurse gladys and his even greater love for money which comes at no cost! Accompanied by Granville played by David Jason his errand boy nephew desperate to find a love of his own but always being the fall guy and the butt of the jokes. Arguablly the best part of Arkwright's shop is the 'evil' till! Overall Open All Hours is British comedy at its b-b-b-b-est
3,"Worth a watch, but not Hitchcock by any stretch","Have to be contrarian on this one. Enjoyable, well-acted BBC thriller is marred by a weak lead (Nathaniel Parker), who portrays the less-than-clever protagonist as alternately smug and wimpy, the effect of which becomes somewhat grating by program's end, permitting the great James Fox, playing the ambiguously affiliated villain, to steal the show. Also, unconvincing, low-heat sex scenes would have been better implied than attempted. Hitchcockian in plot, yes, but little of the cinematic panache (or narrative efficiency) of that venerable director can be found here. 3-plus stars."
4,Nice apple cutter,"I chose to buy the Amco because it was made completely from metal and not plastic. It requires some force to use, but it slices well. If the apple is not uniform, you may have to trim some seeds. Overall, I am happy with the purchase because my kids want to eat more apples now that we have this corer."
4,i love naughty women,"I loved the Barbara stanwyck films, especially lady of burlesque. The other movies were ok. Unfortunately, one of the films ' blonde ice ' didn't work. It was fine for the first 25 minutes, but then it froze up and never got going again. Still not bad for the price."
2,Dangerous Dames Collection,"I enjoy watching old classic movies. The stories are great, but the quality of the DVD is poor. It is very difficult to watch. The movies are dark, and a little fuzzy. Just of very poor quality. I would not recommend this collection for those reasons. If it were remastered, I would recommend the collection. I guess that's what I get for paying $6.99 for a collection. But I must say that I have purchased other movies at a low great rate and they turned out to be wonderful. That is why I shop Amazon for my old classic movies."
5,Great value,In new condition just as advertised. The movies themselves were still in great viewing condition. Will definitely reccomend. You don't see this kind of acting in our times!
2,Dangerous Dames Collection,"I loved the movies, but the quality of the dvd was not up to standards. When loading the dvd it several attempts to get it started, and when it did begin it was necessary to restart it again as it got stuck. Other blue ray and dvd players did the same thing when it was tried."
2,not exact match,"seller claimed this item would work with my 1997 Camry but it was not. it was missing a non-removable metal pin on the back shoe for the ""manual"" brake cable and hardware."
5,R16 bulb,It works fine. I have used this product before from other sources - Its the best R16 bulb out there.
5,Looking out for binder owners,I'm sure this is not a very popular model number and would not fit a vast array of vehicles. It is for a 4cyl international harvester scout 152 or 196 with holley distributor. The build quality was excellent. It is made out of very thick material and has great strength. I actually broke another brand trying to depress the springs to get it to secure to the distributor. As you can see in the picture it has the window for points adjustment just like the factory cap had. If your factory cap does not have the window then you are looking at the wrong cap for your IH.
3,"Not the very best of Williams, but good.","Oliver Kemp, a self-made man from a poor background, hires a young inexperienced woman as a favor for his business associate, even though his better instincts tell him not to. Francesca Wade, a beautiful, wealthy woman, is determined to act as professional as possible, since Oliver shows nothing but comtempt for her priveleged background, claiming that she's not capable of taking her work seriously as she doesn't realize the value of money and hard work. This forms the backbone of the whole book, this clashing of the two individuals because of their different upbringings. All's well till animal attraction gets out of hand, making Fran pregnant. Honorable Oliver marries her, and till the very end neither confesses that they are truly,madly and deeply in love with each other. Okay for reading in bed, but not the best book I've ever read."

1,Spiritual Androgyneity,"In her 1990 book, Living the Vision: Religious Vows in an Age of Change, Sr. Barbara Fiand sarcastically sketches her impression of ""pre-Vatican II"" Catholic theology which, ""for the sophisticated reader trained in post-Vatican II theology"", she writes, ""may be somewhat offensive."" She sees the Second Vatican Council as correcting the errors of a false ""foundational mythology"". What preceded the Council, she states, was merely a construct of the ""dualistic-patriarchal system,"" which believed there was a right and a wrong, a good and an evil, a masculine and a feminine. Sr. Barbara, however, wants no part of that. She preaches the ""holistic"" approach which holds there can be no right and wrong, no good and evil, no light and dark, no masculine and feminine. For those who subscribe to such outmoded ""foundational myths"" as understood in traditional Catholicism, they are ""simplistic."""
4,Finally-an Affordable Heli,"Having had several previous iterations of Air Hogs products from Christmas givers who didn't know what else to but...I had thought ""here we go again"", but this product is what it says it is....a controllable INDOOR flyer. If I have 1 criticism it's that the battery life is too short...and when you reach the end, the heli will crash if you don't get it down soon enough...but other than that, it's really well designed...and at $40.00, it's a bargain based on my previous experience"
5,A STUNNER !,"This DVD & VHS has probably the best looking, hottest and sexiest women in the world. Trish, Lita, Molly, Stacy and Torrie look too too hot. Everyone who buys it will love it and watch it over and over especially the guys :P If you have a DVD player then I recommend the DVD simply because it has extra features mainly 10 matches which are worth seeing all the way. ...Overall a 5 Star DVD and VHS.BUY IT !"
5,This DVD is great if you love the Divas,"ThIs DVD was great and will be a treat for a person who loves the Divas especially Lita, Torrie, Stacy and especially Trish!Buy it its awesome!"
1,NOTHING NEW.,"In its usual fashion, the WWE has decided to play it safe and not give guys what they really want. You will see a few good shots, but in general the Divas just talk and talk throughout the video. You can hear the divas talk for free on TV; so why make us pay for it? You won't see any NUDITY here, instead the divas will just talk and show you some baby pictures."
2,Mixed examples and broad strokes that can mislead,"The authors attempted to cover too much ground and have a very spotty record of being helpful. I have trained people for 40 years how to integrate faith and counseling and it is a challenge to do it rightly and ethically. One of the articles in this volume on using Rational Emotive Therapy used a strong Christian teenager who was confused and upset with his homoerotic temptations. The therapist, IMO, was unethical in promoting his own pro homosexual ideas mixed with RET to try to change the young man's convictions. He had obviously was a novice in working with same sex attractions and never asked the client permission to take the cognitive tack in trying to convince the teen that homosexual behavior was acceptable.By bringing so many different people with different views of spirituality and different views of therapy the result is a very mixed up bag that will be unhelpful to most Therapists."

1,The warranty is a lie,"Try calling XACT's tech support line at 866-466-9228. You'll find there is no way to talk to a live operator. If you navigate to the menu for warranty/repair information, you are only given an e-mail address [...]which you must e-mail several times to even get a response, and that reponse just says to return the item to the retailer.It XACT's reponsibility, not the retailers, to replace a defective product after 90 days, according to XACT's own warranty policy! They are shirking their responsibility and I can only conclude that their products are of such poor quality that honoring their warranty would bankrupt the company.The product of theirs that I bought was an XACT cordless headset phone (the XG2500) and its battery was useless after 9-10 months from the purchase, lasting about 10 minutes fresh off the charger. I'm putting out this one-star review as a warning to others: the products are poor and the warranty is fake."
1,Size NOT 1 OZ.,"Even though the title and the description for this item says 1 oz, the bottle of oil i received WAS NOT 1 oz. It was only 1/3 oz (10 ML). I know this for a fact because i've bought many bottles of perfume oil and they were all 1/3 oz and this bottle was EXACTLY the same size and shape as all the other bottles i've purchased. I cant speak for any of the other sellers' items listed under this title, i can only speak of the 1 i bought specifically from the seller Halaleveryday. So buy with caution."
1,Do not buy this blender!,"This is the first time I am writing a review for a product EVER. That is how bad this blender is. Do not buy it! It is extremely large and heavy compared to other blenders I've had and the large spout makes it impossible to pour liquid out without spilling it all over. At times, it has trouble blending the smoothies I make for my toddler. I have found this blender to be nothing but one big frustration. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing!"
2,"Powerful, loud, overpriced","Although this blender looks great and feels sturdy, it is very loud and has poor speed controls. It's pretty much all or nothing with this thing. It's ok at blending iced drinks, but you continually have to push the mixture back down toward the blades. It works very well when mixing watery drinks, but then so does a spoon. I have also noticed a electrical burning odor when using the blender. Mine recently gave up (won't start) and I won't be getting another Cuisinart. It does look really nice, but it cost way too much given the poor performance."
1,Returned It,"Sorry I had to return this wanna be blender. I bought this at Costco and thought my blender worries were over. Before I used it I read the reviews here. I thought, hmmmm ok. Yes the stars are low, but lets give it a try and see how it goes.Well, the reviews were right. This blender fails to do its job. First and foremost it doesnt get that suction vortex going that brings your mixture from the top to the bottom where the blades are. No matter how much I shook it and tried to help it blend, it was to no avail. My soup was chunky, my puree looked like a soup.Bottom line I didnt need to see anymore. The reviews, my personal experiance all the same.Bye Bye Cuisinart. Hello kitchen aid KSB560."
2,junk,"I have had this blender for a couple years, but jsut began using it recently. IT lasted for 1 month of using it 1-3 times a day. I did blend ice, which this machine has a setting for. This morning it started smoking and the teeth burned right off the clutch. I called cuisinart to see if maybe they could replace it and they said I had to ""send it in and they would decide.used"" with me paying for shipping. No thanks, the thing weighs at leat 10 lbs. I will buy the best blender on the market. VITAMIX.Funny thing is my friend had the same problem with 2 kitchen aid blenders and they replaced them both, no questions asked. I barely used it. I wont buy their crap again."
1,Poor Customer Serivce from Cuisinart,"I have had this Cuisinart blender less than 5 years and used it fewer than 15 times and it already completely stopped working. I only used the blender for very simple, low impact recipes (to puree soups, make hummus and mix milkshakes) so its performance was particularly disappointing.When I emailed Cuisinart regarding the situation and received a prompt call back, I had great expectations for the customer support Cuisinart would provide. I was very disappointed when the telephone representative told me to ""go buy a new one"" because the repairs would cost more than purchasing a new blender. It is unfortunate that this was the best response Cuisinart could muster.After reading several online reviews and talking with friends, it seems that poor customer serivce is now standard from Cuisinart."
2,Leaking mess,"Bought this to make frozen drinks. Crushed ice well, but the design of the glass pitcher and plastic base traps any liquid or condensation that runs down the outside of the unit. Next time you pour a drink, the trapped liquid ends up leaking everywhere. I don't recommend this one."
2,Leaks,Basically works okay. Seems to have plenty of power. Very loud. Would not recommend it due to the extensive leaking.
2,Not a good purchase,"This blender does a good job of blending ice into a smoothie, but I'd not buy this blender again. The noise is not terrible, and the size and weight are not too difficult to deal with. The construction of assembling the base with the blades onto the motor each time almost guarantees that it will leak into the motor. Sometimes I'd get it to leak less or not at all, but most of the time I'd get that heavy motor smell and greasy leakage when I lifted the bowl off the base. I've not used it that much, and now the motor is wearing out, most likely because liquid has leaked into the motor."
4,Opt for a different blender - get one with an all-metal drive,"I love this blender's functional design and heavy glass pitcher. Excellent product with one major flaw - an all metal drive. I purchased this and within one week had to return it because the plastic couplings got shredded because it didn't seat on propery one time I used it and ... that was the end of the blender! I opted for an Oster with an all-metal drive at Wal-Mart. It was actually less expensive, but I lost no quality and gained an all-metal drive. This is a great product - especially for occassional use. Just MAKE SURE to ALWAYS seat the couplings together in a perfect fit or you'll be out a blender. The company's return process is very straight-forward. If you want a great blender that WILL LAST, try this one out instead.Oster BVCB07-Z 6-Cup Glass Jar 7-Speed Blender, Stainless Steel"
2,pretty but loud,"Pros:- pretty- largish carafe- good customer serviceCons:- *very* loud -- it literally hurts my ears to stand in front of it- blade assembly broke- takes a long time to thoroughly crush ice (~1 minute for a cup of ice)As reported by others, our blade assembly also ground itself away, leaving metal dust all over. On the plus side, customer support mailed us a new piece, free of charge.This blender is prettier than our cheap old white one, but functionally I'd have to call it a downgrade.One other tip: don't use the little spout to pour; that is really messy. Instead just pour out of the corner of the square carafe."
1,Expensive garbage.,"I spent the bread to buy the best blender Cuisinart makes, the most powerful motor, etc and etc. It appears scientifically designed to be unable to pour anything without spilling it everywhere, running all down the side of the glass -- I can't imagine what they were thinking when they designed this. And: it leaks when you pour it, and it leaks down into the housing, so that when you pour again, there is no way to not dump stuff on your counter top. Smooth move, Cuisinart! Way to design! I'm going to dump it and get something else, and I can promise you that it isn't going to be made by Cuisinart. I make smoothies every day, and the one good thing about the blender is that it does have the power and speed to finely grind anything you throw in it; probably you could toss in a handful of bolts and get metal shavings. So it does do that well. But that's all it does well. Don't buy this or anything else from these people, this company had a good name but it doesn't any longer. Junk."
1,My friend starved,"My friend had his jaw wired shut after an operation. It worked for about a week, then stopped working altogether. It no longer got power (perhaps something to do with the ""smart"" power). Cuisinart reps helpfully said to unplug it for 15 minutes and try again. When pressed as to what mechanism inside would be triggered after such a wait, they said there isn't. Maybe you just hope it will work. He couldn't eat that night and had to ask friends to return the product. Afraid he would starve anew upon getting a Cuisinart replacement he is looking for a different product. Preferably one that works and doesn't starve him to death."
4,PROS & CONS,"FIRST THE PROS, BEING A LOVER OF FROZEN MARGARITAS I'VE BEEN THROUGH MY SHARE OF UNDERPOWERED BLENDERS, NOT THE CASE HERE, THIS BABY MAKES SHORT WORK OF A BLENDER FULL OF ICE, THE DRINKS WERE SMOOTH AS COULD BE AND THE LARGE CAPACITY IS GREAT.THE BLENDER ITSELF IS VERY QUIET AND IT BREAKS DOWN EASILY FOR CLEANING ALTHOUGH I WILL RECOMMEND THAT YOU DON'T FORGET THE RUBBER GASKET WHEN ASSEMBLING AS THE RESIDENT 16 YEAR OLD DID WHEN MAKING A SMOOTHIE OR YOU WILL BE SOAKING THE BASE IN WD-40 TO UNSCREW IT. THE CONS ARE SHORT, OTHER THEN THE FACT THAT AFTER THE FIRST USE IT DIED AND HAD TO BE RETURNED I WANT TO KNOW WHO DESIGNED A [money] BLENDER WITH A [money] SPOUT, KEEP A BUNCH OF BAR RAGS AROUND WHEN IT'S TIME TO SERVE."
5,Great Blender,Don't be fooled by the poor reviews. This blender has performed flawlessly for the last 3 months. I have used it approximately 30 times and haven't had a single issue.Update as of 4/8/09 the blender is still operating great. No issues. I thought that the plastic handle might be an issue when I purchased it but to my delight no problems. We have used the blender for numerous parties from margaritas to pina coladas.Update as of 02/01/10 still no problems after making hundreds of blended drinks. Absolutely no issues at all.
3,4 Years of Light Duty and It's a Goner,"My wife and I received this as a wedding present 4 years ago. We use it infrequently, and recently have noticed a strong burning smell. Similar to what other people have said it appears the plastic gearing that powers the blade is too weak to support any kind of heavy job and some light jobs. I have used it more lately and it stinks up the kitchen and has even made some pretty terrible noises. I imagine that it will continue to work intermittently, but I am going to need a new one. I think I will not choose Cuisinart.My parents have had the same Oster blender for 30 years."
2,Blade Assembly stripped after 5 weeks use,"Well, I was very happy with this blender (my previous one was inherited from my grandfather, and was probably 30 years old when the motor died a few months ago, so my basis for comparison wasn't all that high). It was fairly quiet, and very quick to make my smoothies every morning. Went through the frozen strawberries no problem - frozen bananas were a little slower.Until this morning. I'd just added the frozen bananas when the blender started making a nasty sound. I turned it off, tried again, same sound. The blade assembly was stripped, never to be used again. It's probably a $10 replacement part, if I could find it.As it is, I'm glad I'm still covered by the store 60-day guarantee. I'll be checking out alternative blenders when I go in this weekend."
1,DANGER!!! Consumer beware!!!!,"Length:: 0:50 MinsI purchased this very model from Macy's and it burned up and melted the bottom unit of the blender after limited use. I did not use this blender often and noticed it tended to smoke. Foolishly, I did not follow up on the smoking issue presuming it was simply because of friction. Well....it actually melted while I was blending a fresh raspberry smoothy. I contacted the Cuisinart company directly and was told there was nothing they could do since the unit was a model they no longer supported. I will never purchase another Cuisinart appliance based on this experience and the fact that the company would not stand by their product! Please refer to my video review for further details and images of the melted unit."
2,Not reliable,"I bought this blender for its jar size, its 600 watts of power and the Cuisinart name. I assumed that meant high quality and dependable. I bought it in 11/03 to make smoothies, milkshakes and the occassional pina coloda. Two weeks after I bought it, it stopped working completly. I returned it to the place of purchase for an exchange. I figured it was a fluke. Now, less than 6 mo. later the blade assembly has stripped (blade spins freely from plastic gear housing). I consider my use normal - smoothies 1 to 2 times per week and the occassional milkshake or pina colada. And, when I call Cuisinart to inquire about the warranty, I have to leave messages that do not get returned in a timely fashion. I am very disheartened over my expensive Cuisinart mixer."
1,Terrible mixer - huge disappointment,"I'll repeat what others have said. I've owned this for about three years, used it very infrequently for frozen fruit smoothies, when the black plastic gear housing sheared off from the base, rendering the blades useless. I called Cuisinart and was advised to buy a new gear assembly, which wasn't the problem. I hate throwing away good money after bad. When I called back, customer service seemed in denial of this obvious engineering flaw, and wanted me to pay to ship the heavy base and pay to repair it. I realize it was just past warranty, but given my infrequent use and the company's bad design, I just felt that Cuisinart should make things right for the expensive product they sold. My $30 Black and Decker blender has outperformed this $100 Cuisinart. If customer service dealt with this issue, I would have given them another chance, but now I will always avoid and never recommend Cuisinart."
3,Why can't it pour?,"An expensive purchase that I spend alot of time thinking about before I bought it. Once I made the leap I was thrilled with my new blender, powerful, practical, something I would be able to use for many years to come.Once it was cleaned and put together I put it to use and everything was great until I tried to pour out what I had made. The spout on the glass jar is useless! While the liquid pours out some also dribbles over the spout, down the front of the jar and in between the base and the jar so you would always have to pull the assembly apart to clean it.Considering everything you make in a blender has to be poured out I am very disappointed and will probably return this blender.If this blender could pour as well as the rest of it works I would give it five stars but my disappointment means 3 stars at the most, which isn't enough to warrant the price I paid."
1,plastic clutch plate on motor melted,"Great blender when it works, but the plastic clutch plate on the motor shaft will melt if you blend for more than 30 seconds at a time. Mine gradually melted until it would no longer work -- a replacement part (SPB7-20TXN) costs about $8 including shipping (here on Amazon). I'll repair it and stick with if for now, but my next blender will have to have a metal clutch. Note that even the high rated Oster and Waring blenders that used to have metal parts now have a lot of plastic (even the same models #s that used to be great), so this is an industry wide cost cutting and lower quality enabling phenomenon. The glass pitcher on this blender is great in my opinion, although the gasket connection is difficult to clean. If anyone knows which blender is best, please let me know. Its not this one."
2,"poor quality, poor construction","I've owned this blender for about 3 years, and would not recommend it to anyone. Functionally, it is pretty good for liquids, but terrible if you are trying to blend solid foods. I like to make smoothies and find that I frequently have to stop and stir the contents so that everything gets blended. I've never had this issue with other types of blenders.There are a lot of plastic parts on this blender, as mentioned in other reviews. The handle and the lip around the bottom of the glass bowl are both plastic, as are several of the main mechanical pieces.I'm disappointed with this product and would not buy it again."
1,Don't walk- RUN from this blender,I have in the past looked at the Cuisinart name on a product as a positive. This product undoes many years of customer loyalty. It sucks.
1,garbage,"Bought this blender a couple of years ago, didnt really use it that much but noticed it always smelled like something was burning. Also it does not crush ice very well. I thought because of the companys reputation and the sturdiness, it would perform well, not true. I paid over $100 and now buying a new blender. Do not buy this blender. Worst blender I have ever own."
3,cheap parts,"I bought this blender from savers for only 8 bucks so I cant really complain but for those who have spent 100.00 I would be more upset. The handle snapped after a couple weeks of use. I was using it everyday, but it shouldnt do that. Also the bottom plastic jar holder split and broke after the 4th week?? now im looking for a new jar holder?! Seems like it was cheaply made."
2,Expect to buy replacement parts often.,"I have had 2 of these and my neighbor has one as well. Between us, we've had to buy replacement parts 5 times as the connection from the pitcher to the base keeps burning out. Once you start smelling burning rubber, go out and buy a replacement piece (if you can find one) because you will need one soon.Heavy blender does the job. No very durable."
1,Absoulute Rubbish,Since day one I knew that this blender was poorly made. While using it I would smell something burning in the blender. I wouldn't be surprised if one of these blenders catches on fire.Eventually it would stop working. Now I have to pay $20 dollars and wait a month to have it repaired even though Cuisinart knows that it has a serious design flaw.
2,"LEAKY, CHEAPLY MADE","My wife and I have been faithful Cuisinart purchasers until we bought this blender.It looks nice, but the plastic which holds the blades breaks easily then the blender leaks (hairline crack). But don't worry it only costs you $16.95 to buy another one which will probably break all too soon."
1,Doesn't handle crushing ice without breaking down.,"I've gone through two blades. You would think a big, heavy blender like this would have an ounce of guts, but this thing is really horribly made. It's sort of challenged by anything other than mixing jello smoothies with marshmallows. Get it together Cuisianart!"
1,worst blender ever,"If there is something I shouldn't have bought this is IT. As someone already said: stardling loud. Frequently It brakes that piece at the botton ($9.95 each) even using just liquid.No compre é fria. Estou arrependido, mas e agora?"
1,Save Your $. Don't Buy This Blender!,We have had this blender less than a year and it went ka-put on us this morning. Black plastic shavings all over the blender and it no longer blends. Looks nice but it's useless now. I'm praying that Costco will exchange it!
1,Garbage,"I've got two of those: one on promotion and one as a gift. With a very light use none of them lasted more than a couple of months. Both had a problem with a pitcher base, where the screw holds the rotating wheel. One had broke completely, another started to leak. Both are in the garbage."
2,"Used to love it, now I'm grossed out","I have had this blender for 3-4 years. I have not had any trouble with smoking, and the noise never bothered me. Although I have had trouble with messy pouring, this blender has made hundreds of wonderful smoothies over the years. However, recently I have started noticing several problems when I look inside the glass:1. There is rust on the inside of the metal bands that circle the container near the top and the bottom.2. There is mold and rust between the metal base and the container.3. I've never been able to get the metal base off the bottom so I can't get in there to clean, and now it looks like some mold is coming through by the rubber gasket at the bottom.I called Cuisinart and they offered to sell me a new container for $40. I think the design of this model is flawed and that they should replace it for free. I would not recommend this model of blender to anyone."
1,It won't last; burning smell,"We've had this blender for 4 years. Increasing smells hot, burning, as many other reviewers here also write. It worked fine at first, but this won't last. Going to contact the company to request another model."
2,"Let me put it this way, I'm on amazon right now trying to find a new one","I've had this blender for 7 years or so and compared to my last it seems really professional and sturdy. However, for 7 years, I've put up with making messes every time I pour it and having to go to the sink to pour a glass of whatever it is I'm making. I thought that surely after this long of this poor container design that they'd have a new one. I seriously cannot believe that they haven't come out with a new pitcher yet. IT'S AWFUL!"
2,Don't Buy,"It looks nice, I like stainless, I like glassIt blends ok, plenty of power, but poor mixing action. Ok for milk shakesMakes a mess when you poor it. liquids cling to the edge and run down the glass, thick shakes just go everywhere, using the corners doesn't help.Biggest flaw, less then a year and a dozen times of using it its broke, no idea what happened, it worked a couple weeks ago, went to use it today no lights.Worthless don't buy."
1,Junk!,"I've received two of these Cuisinart blenders over the past few years as gifts. Both of them smoked and melted at the gear connection after only a few uses. The customer service is a joke ... they wanted shipping to be paid both ways, along with unspecified ""processing fees"" to repair the product. Since I had two of these go through the same failure, I would expect it to happen again. No thanks on the ""warranty"" and no thanks to Cuisinart. They need to take these junky products off the market. I'd give this 0 stars if I could."
2,terrible performance,"I purchased this blender at costco and had high hopes. The blender is very loud and walks around the counter. The blender struggled with frozen strawberries and I needed to push the berries down into the blades every time I used it. The texture of the smoothie is rather coarse. The pouring design is terrible. I have to guide the smoothie with a spoon or else it spills. After 2 weeks the unit melted the blade unit into one piece and needed to be replaced. Also, the unit smoked every time I used it before the blade unit melted. I have since replaced this cuisinart with a kitchenAid 5 speed blender ksb550. The kitchenaid is awesome! This unit is far more powerful, crushes ice and frozen berries into a very smooth and evenly mixed smoothie, is quieter, never need to push down ingredients and pours out of the pitcher beautifully. I make very thick smoothies which I eat with a spoon and the kitchenaid doesn't struggle at all."
1,Two speeds: Fast and Faster,"We've owned and sporadically used this blender for just over three years. Usage was limited to 3-4 times a month during the summer months.This thing has two speeds: fast and really fast - both of which are entirely too much to get a smoothie started. All it will do is create an air bubble at the bottom and hold it there. After three years of ""I *hate* this blender!"", the glass carafe cracked all the way up the side while we were making a smoothie. This thing's going into the trash and we're getting a Breville."
1,Save your money!,"The blender lasted less than a year before the smell everyone talks about occurred and now the motor is fused. The only good thing about it was that the glass canister could be put in the dishwasher without taking it apart. Horrible pouring, limited speeds, heavy, heavy, heavy. The negative reviews are correct. Look for another blender - I can't believe I spent money for this blender thinking a Cuisinart was top notch for my kitchen. Cusinart - take this off the shelves before it really hurts your reputation!"
2,Too much trouble,"Looks great in my kitchen but I, too, only use it for shakes & smoothies. It DOES smell like burning rubber nearly every time. I used to think something was wrong with it and now I just disregard it. And after less than two years or making smoothies, I'm replacing the blade & gasket assembly."
1,Door Stop,"If you need a hundred dollar door stop, this your blender! I used this mighty blender with its 600 watt motor 3 times, mixing up 2 cups soy milk & 2/3 cup frozen blueberries. This should not be a very tough task at all for such a powerful appliance. The third mixing, in consecutive days, the motor quit, never to start again. I returned the unit for a full refund. I always thought Cuisinart was a top of the line brand. I guess I was wrong!"
2,Doesn't last,"When it works, this blender does a fine job, and looks great. However, our first one quit turning the blades in less than a year. We sent it in, after MANY calls to customer service, and they kept the darned thing for 3 months before deciding to send us a replacement. The replacement lasted only 2 years before the blades broke. During that 2 years, we figured out that our extra set of blades didn't fit in bottom ring properly, and allowed fluid to pour through the motor. Great. I should have save up to buy a vitamix instead."
5,2nd blender of this exact brand,My turning spindle has finally given up. I have had it for 8 years and we make smoothies and shakes every day at least twice a day. It is loud as most blenders are but very efficient. No complaints!
2,"nice for about a year, then downhill.","the motor seizes up and refuses to actuate the impeller, and the the carafe leaks as well as shows small fractures and chips at the base."
1,Recall Candidate,The plastic piece surrounding the blades shattered putting chards of plastic into a smoothie I prepared for my three year old son. I discovered the problem before he ate any. Luckily he eats slow.
2,Seriously awful; Glad to see I am not the only one who thought so!,"We received this blender as a gift a couple years ago. Since then, whenever we try to make smoothies, probably 90% of the time this blender fails to properly crush the contents of the smoothies. It also (basically from day 1) always seemed to smell like burning rubber. I re-read the manual to see if I was doing something wrong but couldn't find anything that seemed significant. I am glad to come here to Amazon and see that I was not the only one having this problem (well, maybe ""glad"" is the wrong word here because all these reviewers got stuck with a dud blender like me!). I would highly, highly recommend looking elsewhere for your blender needs."
1,Disappointing,"The handle is cheap plastic and cracked soon after we began using it.Even though it has an ice crush feature, the motor began smelling hot when making smoothies, and finally just died.It was disappointing; we purchased because of the Cuisinart name. Now, we don't think we will ever buy another Cuisinart product."
1,do not last long,I have gone through almost one of these every year. I replaced them through my employer since I work at a store that sells them. No more. I agree with the reviewer who called them decorative junk. The Cuisinart coffeepots are just as bad. I've had to replace at least six. I am plunking down the money for a Vita-mix since I talked to people who have had theirs for 14+ years.Vita-Mix 1300 TurboBlend 4500
2,quality control problems?,"Although we love the blender's performance, after a few months the top cracked. Cuisinart people contacted by phone were nice and we were able to get a replacement ; it did cost us 11 bucks however. In October 2011 the machine totally quit. Press the buttons and nothing happens. Not even a light. Blown internal fuse? Who knows. Called Cuisinart but recording said at least 5 minute wait to speak to human. Hope we can figure it out. Note: we bought this blender in April 2010."
4,Resolution,"Pouring must be done from one of the square corners on the top. Since owning, the plastic collar cracked, the handle assembly came apart and the glass cracked after going through the normal heated dry cycle of the dishwasher. Replacement of the glass jar would have been $40+.Contacted the company again and they are sending a replacement jar. I thought that this was handled well, and will continue to do business with the company. This is a family run business and they care about their customer base, once problems are profiled to the next level. The unit is powerful and ice can be blended for smoothies. Be sure the jar gearing is well seated for purchase of the driver gears befor starting the motor. Now satisfied with purchase!"
1,Freezing Motor,"This is another disappointment from Cuisinart. Everytime I use it to mix a smoothie, with yogurt and fruit, the motor just freezes up and burning smell emits. Yesterday smoke started pooring out of it. NEVER buy Cuisinart appliances -- I buy their most expensive product lineup and EVERY TIME have failures. A new food processor took a dozen emails, calls, and shipping returns to finally get a bowl that wouldn't lock up with food in it. My coffeepot drips when it pours, very poor design. I returned a crock pot because I burned myself on it everytime I used it.Disgusted, what a disaster!"
2,Blenders,I bought this blender at Lowes Home Improvement 1 year ago.I paid $100 plus tax for it. Its noisey to use plus now (already) the cutting assembly has quit. I have notified Cusinart & they are sending new(cutting assembly) but its costing me almost $30 to replace.I bought this one because the cheaper one had quit before that. Im not buying anymore Cusinart products if this is the best they can stand behind it as this appliance was not abused & used only as specified.
2,Buy a different blender!,"I have to join others in saying that this blender is LOUD and poorly constructed. I make a morning smoothie with bananas, yogurt and 6 or so frozen strawberries (a good blender should be able to handle that, right?) and have had the blade melt on me. Hoping to replace it with a metal blade, there is no such product available! I've read good things about the Oster Beehive, which is cheaper!"
1,Powerless,"This blender is a total waste of money. I used it for smoothies, but every time you add ice to the mix the blender can not handle it, it virtually stops working when faced with crushing ice, even though it has a ""Crush Ice"" button. I have to put in all the smoothie ingredients, then walk away for 20 minutes while the ice melts enough for the blender to be able to do it's job. Even ice cream brings this blender to it's knees."
1,Horrible blender at any cost,This blender is awful. It is too heavy and doesn't do a very good job with most foods. The final straw for me came when I tried to unscrew the base and blade to clean them. They are stuck and no one has been able to get them apart. This is a huge problem with this blender since the seals are terrible and food gets caught in between everything. Do not waste your money on this blender.
3,Cuisinart CBT-500,"It is heavy and it is big, so dedicated counter space is best. My biggest complaint however is it is LOUD! I don't use it as often as I thought I would because it is so LOUD, much more so than the processor while working larger, firmer food. I haven't noticed any burning smell yet, but I'm not the primary user either. I love Cuisinart, and have their products throughout my kitchen...but the noise on this one makes me shy away from using it much."
3,Very very pretty but not easy to keep clean and working well,"I used this blender for about a year and a half, and it is very pretty to have out on the counter, but it is a bit of a pain to keep clean. Issues with cleaning are:1) The fittings need to be very tight so that they don't leak, but then they are hard to open to clean it.2) Turning the whole jar upside down in the dishwasher results in collecting water in the inverted base -- i.e. you pull it out then have to dump the water out of the base.3) The fittings wear over time, so they handle gets cockeyed and screwy, and the base cracked eventually.Please note I am a very demanding user, since I make a smoothie every day.I think if you are an infrequent user, this blender is GREAT for you, but if you use it every day, I'd go with the Warring Professional instead."
1,Awful Blender!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worse blender I have ever had. We have made smoothies with frozen blueberries, peaches, etc...not even using hard ice and the motor quit! We have gone through THREE of these blenders and all of the motors have quit with just minimal use! We will take the blender back for a refund now!!! This blender has a burning electrical smell when you use it and we have tried to use just the low speed, pulse, and even blending just a little SOFT berries at a time....still the motor quit!!!! HORRIBLE piece of equipment!!!! This blender should be taken off of the market..it is unfair to the consumers!!!"
2,Good motor. Terrible container design.,"The CBT-500 looks great in the kitchen. The motor and controls are convenient and seem solid. It's fun to use. This blender is an advertisement for the upper-end, two speed blender, as opposed to the 18-speed monstrosities.However, the CBT-500 has a huge flaw: the glass container is an abomination. It is virtually impossible to pour liquid from the container without losing a quarter of the contents. I wonder if the design engineers bothered to simply fill the container with water and pour it. If they had, they would have seen that the liquid dribbles all over. No one should try to use this device without a sink nearby to catch the spillings."
3,The musical turning pont towards Thrash Metal,"This Album is musically ruthless! No wonder Metallica saw fit to include two of there songs on their new release, ""Garage Inc."" I was blown away by the ripping guitar assault! Cheers to an underrated band!"
2,Ok while it lasted,"I purchased this sharpener in June of 2011. I'm now shopping for a new sharpener. While it worked, it did an adequate job with careful use. The construction is fairly flimsy, so it is easy to get misalignment. The grinding wheel arbor is plastic with nothing holding it in place on the motor shaft except friction. The chain vise is also poorly built. It doesn't do a very good job of holding the chain tightly in place. Last night when sharpening a chain, the chain vise stripped out, so now instead of doing a poor job of holding the chain in place, it doesn't hold the chain in place at all. I would not recommend this unit. Buyer beware, you get what you pay for."
5,Good quality,Fast shipping. Sharpens the chainsaw in no time! Nice machine to have and i will use it a lot in the future.
1,didnt like,"i didnt like this product because when i opened the box right after i got it it was broke. the wheel is broke, the vise is broke, and the outer part is broke. i tried calling the number in the package to let them know it was broken when it arrived and all i got was a bus signal. i can not get ahold of buffalo tools."
4,Great sharpener for price,"Works very well for the ""Do-It-Yourselfer."" About the cost of two new chains. However, one down side is that you can't adjust the side-plate angle, set at about 60deg."
4,sharpener,This is not a bad product for the price. It performs exactly what it advertizes. The only problem with this machine is the poor chain clamp. Otherwise it is a nice machine for the price.
3,Other Reviewers Seem Too Generous,"I bought this sharpener after reading all the glowing, positive reviews, for about $42. It arrived a day early and in good condition. The instructions, obviously written and then translated in China, were poor and incomplete. They never really said how to set up the chain in the locking jaws, or any hints on how to sharpen the chain without doing a link more than once. I came up with my own method of marking each sharpened link with a Sharpie marker. Also, when I did the links on one side, the blade contacts the link on it's underside, then when doing the other side , it touches only the top of the link. What's up with that? Overall, the chain did cut better, but I'm not sure it's as good as a professionally sharpened chain. Finally, I later found a similar unit at Harbor Freight Tools in Fremont, CA for about half the price."
2,Good while it worked,"My husband got this in 2010 to sharpen his chainsaw blade. He was trying to save a few bucks and we didn't want to spend too much money. It lasted all of about 5 months and then broke. The last time he used it, he set the degrees and then when he tried to tighten it up the plastic piece just broke off. There was no salvaging it.We have learned this one fact over and over again, ""you get what you pay for."" It is true. Look for quality and then find the best price on it."
5,IMPRESSED,"I purchased this sharpener on 21 June 2010.I'm just getting around to writing my review.I own twenty plus chain saws of various stripes.Within the last two years I've used this sharpener to sharpen over thirty chains.I have not had a problem with this tools performance in any way.My dollar cost savings has been considerable, I was paying my local shop $15.00 per chain.With a soft touch and a little practice you can sharpen like a pro.I'm wondering why I didn't get one of these earlier?"
4,not bad,"sharpened 4 chains. no problems. take your time with set up and sharpening. a little weak on power, but a light touch is the correct technique anyways."
5,A Wonderful series.,"William Tell is a series I used to watch when I was in short trousers! To see it now is still fun, especially Gessler. Wonderful. There are only 30 episodes on this 3 dvd set, I believe the original series contained 39. If you want to see a good programme from the past,this is my choice. Steve"
3,It's great in spite of itself,"I'll admit it - I love these old shows: Richard Green's Robin Hood, The Adventurer of Sir Lancelot et al. This despite the fact that this version of William Tell is, to be kind, a bit cheesy - the costomes are terrible, the settings equally bad, the acting is challanged and the theme song! After hearing it twice I'm thankful for two things - a mute button and fast forward. That said, it is pure entertainment and I will watch every episode. Now if we could get the William Tell series titled 'Crossbow' that aired on the Family Channel, starring Will Lyman and Jeremy Clyde (of Chad and Jeremy fame) then we would really have some great viewing."
4,Old TV,"This series caught my eye when it was played as a late night filler. The plots are a bit far fetched, but it is interesting to see the use of an obscure medieval legend from Switzerland as a TV show. I liked it. Better than ""Merlin""."
4,Things I should have read in geology class,"A considerable amount of time was exhausted by Mr. Winchester in the research, writing and editing of this bestseller. If my geology course in college, which was a very long time ago, had a book of this substance, I may have spent more time reading and preparing for class.The book does not lead right in to the California earthquake of 1906. You must read a few hundred pages from the creation of the world, the movement of the continents, the history behind the chosen name for San Francisco and other cities, the gold rush days, the segregation of the Chinese, then the climactic earthquake.The book is more of a history and geology lesson than a book with a plot and characters that are followed from beginning to end. This is the book you want to read for that one up on everyone else when earthquakes are the topic at the dinner party (humor emphasized)."
4,"LONG AGO, ON A PLANET FAR AWAY...","It's not every writer dealing with the Great San Francisco Earthquake who would begin the story in Iceland during the Mesozoic Era, but it's one of the charms of Simon Winchester's books. I can understand it may strike some readers as frustrating, but I am always fascinated by connections and ramifications through space and time...Highly recommend this book, and if you do a little skipping here and there, well, no one's looking..."
2,"Writer is so pretentious, it becomes unreadable","Remember the character of Diane from Cheers? The joke of her character, was a characterization of someone who is over the top pretentious. Well, if you were a fan of the show, picture an episode where they were exagerating her character for a joke, and you have Simon Winchester. ""Stepping out of my tent and gazing upon Gemini and..."" No, seriously, that is really a line from the book.Also, there are points in the book where you have to play six degrees of Kevin Bacon, to figure out how what he's talking about, has anything to do with the big quake.While I thought a book about the 1906 quake that devastated San Francisco would be interesting, I couldn't finish this book."
3,A Big Not-So -Riveting Book,"This book covered a lot: the geological make-up of Earth, the States, and California, some political history, California history, San Francisco history, and then the 1906 earthquake and subsequent fires that devastated San Francisco. I found some of it similar to a dry school book, but there were interesting tidbits here and there (Enrico Caruso, John Barrymore, and 4-year-old Ansel Adams were in S.F. at the time of the quake).Although I am glad I read this book (because it truly does have interesting and informative information), I have to say that I wish Erik Larson had written a book about the San Francisco earthquake."
2,The man needs a strong editor,"I loved The Professor and the Madman. I liked ""The Map that Changed the World"" and ""Krakatoa"", though I ended up skimming portions that were bogged down in local geological details. I tried reading this one, but found it unreadable. Lots of unnecessary details and material unrelated to the main topic. If ever a text could benefit from some editing...."
2,simultaneously fascinating and dull,"Well researched, informative, long-winded, rambling and in the end - rather dull. Such a disappointment!"
5,The Technical Side of What Happened,"In 1906 there was the San Francisco earthquake and fire. At the time there was little or no understanding of earthquakes other than their being acts of God. It wasn't until 1968 that the concept of plate tectonics began to be developed that explained not only this earthquake but the 'ring of fire' that circles the Pacific Ocean.Mr. Winchester is an Oxford trained geologist who approaches this writing with the knowledge of an expert and the eye of a novelist. This book is a story of how the San Francisco earthquake was the first to be a major media event. He starts with the story of San Francisco and the earthquake. He recreates the story through the experiences of selected witnesses -- scientists, laborers, businesmen and more famous people such as Enrique Caruso and Ansel Adams.Beyond the story of this particular earthquake, this really began the study of earthquakes and eventually to the development of theories explaining how they happened."
2,Dreadfully Boring,"How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding."
2,Get to the point,"There's nothing wrong with giving background on a subject, but Mr. Winchester abuses the privilege. There's no digression too minute, no reference too arcane, no place where one word can't be replaced with 100. When he does finally get to a set of pertinent points, the writing is excellent. That's what kept me from giving it a worse review. Too bad those excellent parts are as rare as cashews in a tub of economy-brand mixed nuts.If you're prepared to work your way through the innumerable detractions and root out the nuggets, the book is worth your time. Otherwise, pass on it."
4,Will California ever learn? (Yes we did),For those who want to understand one of the most devastating moments in American history this is an excellent book to start with. Winchester has written some of the best natural disaster books and he does not disappoint here. The San Francisco quake devastated a city that was not prepared. Like most of his books the first half takes you through why the geological events occur. As a person who lived only blocks away from the San Andreas Fault I found this incredibly interesting. This book will not be interesting to those who don't have at least a minor interesting in geology. You do not need to have any knowledge to enjoy it but you have to at least be willing to learn because he does go into scientific ideas. Overall though this book will make for an interesting read as you hear about how one of the largest cities on the west coast was nearly wiped from the map.
5,A Stupendous Book!,Simon Winchester wrote a wonderfully informative book! One I would definitely recommend! Keep up the great work!
5,Excellent read!!,"Not only does the author provide an excellent story about the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, its cause, and the resulting fire but he also provides a series of fascinating historical vignettes about San Francisco. This is a worthwhile book to read."
3,More About Geology than the Quake,"Winchester is a great writer, and this is a fine history - but the title is a bit misleading. The book has actually relatively little on the actual effect of the San Francisco quake of 1906. Rather, it uses the event as a focal point for a larger history of our understanding of geological activity in general. There is a lot here on plate tectonics and geologic history, but the actual description of the quake itself and its aftermath is given about 2 chapters near the end. As somebody who already knows a fair amount about this stuff, I found myself skipping forward a lot. Still, a good read"
3,1906 San Francisco Earthquake and Fire,"What better book to read while on a trip to San Francisco than this one? A Crack in the Edge of the World tells the tale of the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake and Fire. The fires that started just shortly after the earthquake exacerbated the devastation the earthquake created. It took three days for the fires to be completely put out. By that time, all of Chinatown and much of San Francisco was in rubble and ashes.It's a little scary to read a book about an awful earthquake while visiting the site of the earthquake, reading expert opinion that there is a 65% probability that another terrible earthquake will hit San Francisco before 2032.Fascinating story."
3,Interesting - but all over the place,"Totally agree with other reviewers... book is interested, but it's all over the place organizationally. Tease us with a little SF Earthquake, then bounce us off to Iceland for some discovery about plate behavior there, then describe an apparent family roadtrip to California, to the night before the Earthquake, to a detail discussion of tectonic plate behavior in central california, to reviews about Enriquo Caruso's operatic performance, to...It's an interesting read, but not very focused."
2,Tedious,"The author seems to have the best of intentions but crams in far too much irrelevant information. I was looking for a book about the Great California Earthquake. This was the wrong book.I much preferred Dennis Smith's ""San Francisco Is Burning: The Untold Story of the 1906 Earthquake and Fires"". Smith's book is much more gripping, and more human. (No, I don't have a connection with either book or author.)In fairness to Winchester, he is clearly an extremely intelligent man. You will learn about geology from ""A Crack in the Edge of the World"", if you can keep awake long enough."
2,"2 separate books, neither of them very good","The author has attempted to merge two books into one - a book about geology, plate tectonics, etc., and a social history of 1906 California. Unfortunately, very heavy prose and some poor editing let him down throughout - constantly jumping from subject to subject and throwing in sayings like ""as we shall see later""...The definitive social history of a natural disaster is, in my opinion, ""The Jonestown Flood"" by David McCullough; see that if you're looking for an interesting, well-researched and superbly written social history. This book might be of interest to some geologists, but that's pretty much it."
1,Great book for the wrong reason.,"This is the book you give your students so they can see how NOT to write -- but laughably so, if they have a sense of humor. Truly a bombastic gem."
2,"If you love tedious geology, this is the one for you!","I wish I would have read the reviews. Literally half of the book is tedious geology- not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's supposed to be the history of the San Fransisco earthquake. We finally get to the substance of the subject fully at page 200 and even then, the exciting parts are pretty boring. I do not recommend."
2,It works but looks horrible,"It works fine but when you use the threads on the inside, you can see the threads on the outside. It doesn't look finished. It should come with a trim piece to screw on over the outside threads if you are not using them."
3,"Adequate, but taller than my old aerator","I just installed three of these aerators at my house. I needed to replace the 8 year old original ones for my faucets which had become calcifiedby hard water. These aerators seem adequate, but get only 3 stars for the following two reasons. (1) No flat areas on the side for easy installation/removal with a crescent wrench. They are perfectly round and smooth. In another 8 years, I'll undoubtedly have to struggle a bit to remove these. (2) They are 1/8 inch taller than my originals, therefore stick down farther out of the tip of the faucet, and are visually less appealing. The exposed height (how tall) is 7/16 inch, my original aerators were only 5/16 inch tall. They are no heavier than the originals, so are undoubtedly of only modest quality. But they were less than 1/2 of the price of no-name aerators at the local hardware store, so not much to complain about."
4,One of my favorite things...,"This album is worth it just for the introductory notes on the ""My Favorite Things/Easy to Love/Baubles, Bangles, and Beads"" medley. I worked with my piano teacher for a couple hours trying to figure them out. Although, I now can play the intro note for note, it just doesn't have that Bill Evans feel. There is only one Bill Evans and if you can purchase only one Bill Evans CD, this would be one to consider."
2,Excellent...but flawed,"Let me first say, the music on this CD is absolutely incredible. Evans has a way with the piano and it shines. However, I have a very good sound system and there is about 30dB of static covering every recording on the CD. Its just infuriating! It takes your attention away from the piano and keeps distracting you. Instead of clean notes with a black background, its noisy and it flushes away the notes. Its like trying to watch the TV during a blizzard. I'm very sorry, but I heard it on several copies of the CD and its just a terrible recording job."
5,An excellent introduction to the fun of classical music for young people,"The first book of the Read Along Symphony series (which is in turn based on the award-winning Sing Along Symphonies music series), Beethoven's Wig is a children's picturebook that combines humor with a love of music. The whimsical story about Beethoven's gigantic and growing white wig is meant to be sung along with the notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Zany illustrations of the catastrophically titanic wig and a bonus CD with ""Beethoven's Wig"" and two previously unreleased songs, all in both vocal and instrumental versions, round out this picturebook treasury. An excellent introduction to the fun of classical music for young people."
2,Too many words Too little content,"Although Mr. Peacock touts his book as an insiders view of Christian music, it really isn't, the book itself could have been written by anyone whether they had an ""insiders"" view or not. I found this book to be very long winded and totally void of any real information pertaining directly to Contemporary Christian Music. The points that Mr. Peacock makes in the book are valid but could have easily been covered in as little as a chapter. Those readers seeking an ""insiders view"" of Contemporary Christian Music should look elsewhere."
4,NT 4.0 Licences,This is a good idea from Amazom.com to carry this product. It will help some people to come strait with piracy conflic and espacialy at that price there is no reason to deroge of any microsoft regulation.
2,Umax 3400 drivers for Windows XP still UnderDev?,"I received my scanner bundled with my PC at the beginning of 2001, which had ME as the OS originally. Just recently upgraded to XP because I could not take it anymore with that dreadful Me!At first after upgrading the OS I was able to get the scanner to work if I used the ""scanner wizard"" that xp supplies but now when I scan the previews as well as the scan has either a blue or red hue to it. I tried the good ole reboot but to no avail. I only have 128 mb of ram and I'm thinking that may have something to do with it. Although I have very little else running in the background when I do scan. Is XP a memory hog or what? Memory upgrade is right around the bend!"
5,Worked great out of the box,"...The Umax 3400 works great for us. I love the Copy and Scan buttons on the front of the unit. Color depth and resolution are outstanding. Installation took about 15 minutes and went off without a hitch. The unit is much smaller than the old E6, fits nicely on my desktop.I've made copies using my Brother HL-1250 printer, and they come out crisp and clear. Much cheaper than buying a personal copier, and I didn't even have to set up software to get the copy function going!"
4,Low price with great service :-),"I am surprised by the number of extremele low ratings and negative reviews for the Unax Astra 3400. I have had no problems using this scanner with my iMac (using Mac OS 9.0.2). The scanning quality is great, and the accompanying software is extremely easy to use.Despite its low price, do not overlook the Astra 3400. I find this great for both general home use, and for the multimedia work I do."
1,Do not buy UMAX !,I bought a Umax 3400 scanner about 3 years ago. The copy utility worked great however the other programs were difficult and touchy. I have since upgraded to Windows XP and it is now not compatible. I bought the software to upgrade it (duh) and it did not work (nonrefundable). I tried to contact the company by phone and they want to charge $25 for tech support over the phone (not to mention it's not an 800# and I had to pay long distance). NO WAY! I tried to e-mail them without any response. DO NOT BUY UMAX. THEIR TECHNICAL SUPPORT STINKS!!!!!
1,Buy Umax only if you will never upgrade your software,"Buy Umax only if you will never upgrade your software. If you plan on upgrading your operating system in the future Umax is not the way to go. Any time you need to upgrade drivers for say a new operating system or if you lost yours, unlike most other computer manufacturers, Umax will not let you download drivers for the upgrade. Instead they will mail you the drivers for [a price]. Real customer service."
2,Crashing the system,"Despite the fine job this scanner does with scanning, its software is very poor. My system is above average and not frequently thrown off, but everytime I connect this thing, the entire system goes ot of whack and frequently freezes altogether. Also, it is a pain to have to unplug the cord from the outlet everytime I want to turn it off because it has no power button...and you also have to take out the usb cord when you unplug it. Bottom line is: good at scanning, but poorly designed for purposes of convinience."
1,Does not work with Windows Me,"The box says Windows 98/2000 or above. After spending 8 hours on installation problems and working with 3 tech support people, the 4th tech support person told me that the bundled Adobe Photoshop software does not work with Windows Me. They had spent a month trying to get it to work, but gave up. I had mentioned to each of the previous tech people that I was using Windows Me. They need to get the message out to their own staff and buyers that it doesn't work with Me."
1,Umax support is AWFUL!!!!,"If you do purchase a UMAX scanner, make sure nothing happens to the driver or software, because they will not help you recover the software/driver ever again. Instead, you purchase drivers and then pay $14.95. I think they are idiots for not supporting their products. I will NEVER buy another UMAX product again. NEVER!!!!!"
2,Absolutely horrible support,"The scanner itself works just fine, its the tech support that sucks. It only runs under Mac OS 9 or Windows 9x. The only reason it still works for us is one machine is running OSX 10.2 which still has the OS 9 VM. Decided to move scanner to PC running WinXP and they want $32 for an updated CD --- no free download for updates. I will never buy another UMAX product if this is how they treat their customers."
1,Not worth the 'free' price tag,"Got it for free with my last computer, finally tried it and it only gives a black screen, barring that, Umax charges for the updates to their non-compatible scanner, after about 3 different drivers (including the pirated real one) and reconfiguring the device, still nothing but black, but hey, least it was free."
4,Seems Good to Me,"I thought a scanner would be a useful addition to my home PC, so I tried to find a steal on just anything. Well when the initial scanner a bought (a no-name brand I can't even recall) crashed my system (2-3 year old Gateway running Windows 98) and took me days to restore, I was concerned that it may not be worth it. After others told me of similar problems, the Umax scanners were recommended to me repeatedly.I found a super deal on this one, although it was triple the price of the no-name one that crashed my PC, it was still quite affordable. It set up without a hitch and scans perfectly fine, although it's not super fast and I've seen slimmer models. Overall, I'm quite happy with it for the price, it fulfills my scanning needs just fine and seems like a quality built product. I can't see spending much more for the light use it gets from me."
1,Disappointing,"This UMAX scanner has been disappointing from the beginning. The Vistascan software did not play nicely with other software on my system. Up until today, I still would have rated the UMAX a 3. But today, I tried to install the scanner on an older PC (since I was tired of it messing up my primary PC). I couldn't find the installation CD so I went to the website to download the drivers. I was very disappointed to find that UMAX now charges for drivers! They want $for the drivers for a $ scanner."
1,Umax software and drivers [disappoint]!,"Like many others, I lost the original CD installation for drivers. UMAX has the gall to actually now charge for drivers and it's an outrageous price. Net affect: forces one to buy a different brand. Now, really, am I going to spend up to [money] on a driver for this scanner when I could put the money toward a good HP scanner or equal? And the VistaScan software which originally cames with the scanner is HORRIBLE! The worst scanner software on the market, far and away. Umax must be in terrible financial straits to use these tactics. Can you say, ""Terrible customer support?"""
1,AUGHHH!!!!!!!!,"When I first used this scanner, I loved it. It did so many cool things and was easy to use and learn. Then, it refused to scan or even preview. I have an iBook SE with 466 MHZ and 320 RAM, so memory or speed is not the problem. I tried everything in the manuals in the box and on the discs. The web site help is no help, and the NOT toll free customer service puts you on hold, then the extension never answers. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the software about five times and spent about 40 straight hours stressed to the gills trying to get it to work and finally having to go to Kinkos to make copies. Then I got on the web and found many sites with similar complaints and people looking for answers. It goes back in the box and back to the store tomorrow."
1,UMAX Poor Service,"I purchased a UMAX 3400 series scanner. It worked initally, but it wouldn't after one month of very light use.I spent endless hours trying anything and everything UMAX suggested in their operating manuals, website, and through tech support. I spent over ten hours of long distance telephone calls mostly waiting to talk to someone in their tech support center just to receive authorization to return this piece of junk.What I did find out that UMAX lies about the resources required to run their scanner. UMAX scanner requires Windows 98 system resources of 90% or over. This is close to impossible for most systems currently sold.What I did find out that UMAX operating manual is incomplete and provide incorrect information.What I did find out that the UMAX tech support center has poor quality telecommunication equipment that caused by dropped calls and static.What I did find out that the UMAX tech support center is under staffed to handle all the calls from people requesting tech support."
1,WARNING! DO NOT BUY ANY UMAX SCANNERS - Read Why!,I just tried to reinstall my UMAX 3400 Scanner on a new computer. I lost the driver disk. I went to their website to download drivers. UMAX NOW CHARGES FOR ALL DRIVERS! DRIVERS AND DRIVER UPDATES ARE NOT FREE. AND THEY ARE EXPENSIVE!! [price] for Drivers!!! UNBELIEVABLE. Boycott this Company NOW!
1,easy come easy go,"I got this scanner because it was the cheapest one I could find, so I shouldn't be disappointed with the results.I used it for a year with one computer and it was great. Then I bought a new computer (windows millenium, p4, all the fixings) and this piece of [junk] scanner gave me all sorts of problems. It didn't install properly, and when I finally did get it to install it wouldn't scan. The lamp came all the way to the front of the unit and then kept on coming, which made an awful screeching noise as it tried to push itself out of the unit.Nothing I did updating drivers or calling tech support worked, this thing was just busted. UMAX is a bargain basement company and their products have pretty bad quality assurance. If you're going to be cheap, I'd advise at least going with a better brand like Cannon, their low-end stuff beats UMAX any day."
4,Excellent Primer For DoItYourself-ers,"If you are looking for a volume that will guide you through simple repairs such as re-wiring a 2-prong outlet into a 3-prong grounded outlet (without forcing loved ones to cash in on that life insurance policy!), this book works just fine. Don't expect anything too too advanced though, but for you basic run of the mill, here's how it works...try this book."
5,One of the best from the 80's,"Way back in the early 80's my cousin and I walked into this independent record store in Missouri to pick up a Blue Oyster Cult album. At the recommendation of the owner we also picked up this GEM. I wore the vinyl out and switched to cassette. As the years went past I recommended MANY other people to this group and we all LOVED this band, and I am recommending them to this day. I am so glad to find them again. I have been searching for many years to replace the cassette that my other cousin stole from me....As with the other reviewers you cannot go wrong here. They are GREAT! I would put them right in the category of AC/DC, Blue Oyster Cult, etc."
4,one of my all-time favorite albums,"I had searched for this album on cd or tape in used music stores and on ebay. My brother had the vinyl and I used to listen to it all of the time. Axe isn't one of the best known or higly acclaimed bands, but the music really does kick. After finally acquiring the tape over five years after losing his record player and records I am back in my own little world. I have been a metal head for as long as I have been and this group will always be one of my favorites. With songs like ""Burn the City Down"" Now or Never"" ""Holdin On"" and ""Silent Soldiers"" I remembered the words the minute the music started. I would definately reccommend this album."
1,"Wish I could say something nicer, but","this book has neither the hard science of ""Could It Be Perimenopause"" by Dr. Steven Goldstein, nor the real solution to the problem, which IS explored in ""Estrogen the Natural Way"" by Nina Shandler. After reading these two books, I felt I really wasted my money on ""The Pause"". I recommend the other two instead."
5,"Thelonious live, and at the top of his game","Of the 16 Thelonious Monk CDs I own, San Francisco Holiday is my favorite. It is a collection from four live performances between 1958 and 1961, a period when Monk was at his absolute best. And what a collection it is, in terms tunes selected, his band members, and overall length (69 minutes). Swinging, enthusiastic and inspired versions of ""In Walked Bud,"" ""Blue Monk,"" and ""Rhythm-A-Ning"" from a concert at Town Hall in New York with Charlie Rouse on sax, Sam Jones on bass and Arthur Taylor on drums. My favorite, though, is ""Bye-Ya/Epistrophy,"" which is nearly 12 minutes of pure magic from the Five Spot in NYC featuring Art Blakey on drums, Johnny Griffin on sax and Ahmed Abdul-Malik on bass. Three tunes from a performance at San Francisco's Black Hawk with a trio of horns (Joe Gordon on trumpet and Rouse and Harold Land on sax) and three from a concert at Theatre L'Olympe in Paris round out this wonderful CD."
2,Makes face feel great - doesn't really change look...,"I bought this product a few months ago because of all the great reviews on the internet. I have moderately severe acne on my cheeks, with a lot of red marks. I had huge hopes that it would make a big difference. Alas...it really didn't. My regimen is:Morning:MD Skincare Daily Foaming FacewashMD Skincare All Over Blemish SolutionCetaphil SPF 15 moisterizerEvening:MD Skincare Daily Foaming FacewashMD SkinCare Alpha Beta Daily Face PeelNOTHING! I've spent loads of money on these products...and it's definitely time to switch, my face is just getting worse and worse (probably not on account of the products, but they're certainly not helping)."
1,not as good as reviews stated,"because of the good reviews on this product, I bought it, hoping it would work the same miracles to my acne as stated in the reviews. I have tried this product for two weeks already, and it's making my acne breaking out worse than before. Yes, the feel of the lotion on the skin is very smooth and silky, but it is not effective at all."
2,Not worth the price for me,"This product may work for other people with other skin types, but this product didn't really work for me. There was a reduction in breakouts, but definitely failed to fully control them. At a price of $80 for 1.7oz, I expect much more from the product. I tried the Murad products, and personally I had far better results, at a much lower price."
2,Exhilaratingly Creepy,"When i was younger, like way younger, i played this game all the time. And seriously, it is the weirdest thing i've ever seen. I don't know WHAT the creators of this game were on, but it would only ever make sense to you if you had some serious problems. For example; I'm riding down this river, and i pass a giant chess set that gave me the chills, a walrus i was afraid to talk to and finally i look up, and i'm in the coffee cup of a very creepy rabbit. The only other way to reach the rabbits house is through the fire hydrant. One of the things that almost brought tears to my eyes was when i turned on mr. rabbit's tv, half of it was static, and the other half reminded me of the video on The Ring. Surprisingly, I was hooked. Disturbed, but hooked."
1,Misleading title,"A collection of cartoons loosely based on the title of the collection, but then it depends on your definition of ""spooky"". The Popeye cartoon does have a halloween theme and the Casper cartoons can be considered spooky, but that's it. I'm curious how the cartoons, ""Jack Frost"" and ""Baloon Land"" even made it into this collection. Misleading title aside, this collection should only be sought after by someone interested in ANY vintage cartoons. No noteworthy catoons here, a real disappointment."
1,"Toons, Yes. Spooky? Fugeddaboutit!","As previous critics have noted, there is little in this copmpilation of (apparently) public-domain cartoons to raise a chill, though it will raise more than a hackle or two.There's not much here of a scary nature. The video transfers are often muddy and dark. And this compiation's producer found necessity in either enhancing the cartoons' original sound effects, or merely adding new ones (often loud enough to muffle the original films' music and dialogue!).A must to avoid."
4,Spiritual Lessons,"He wrote similar to his own teacher -Peter Deunov or AKA Bainsa Douno. Actually if you come upon their writings the information is compiled from lectures in many of the cases.In this book, on page 90, and several other places within the book, you will find some information similar to the teachings of the Law of Attraction. We know this is not a new concept but recently it had gotten some more attention.The information in the book is good. He speaks a lot about karma and the etheric body and at times the information is a bit more occult than spiriutal but overall for someone who wants to become familiar with this Bulgarian teacher's lessons this is a good start.He teaches good morals, love, peace, and so forth so it won't hurt anyone to read it regardles of their religious affiliations. How can these peaceful lessons hurt anyone?"
1,Big Problems,I've had the same problems with this monitor. This first year is was fine and then it started to go. I called SONY and they send me a rebuilt and that one did the same this after a week. I am now on to my third monitor and just today it started to go bad. So it looks like I'll be calling SONY again. I very disappointed I've got a SONY TV that is 30 years old. I guess they just don't built things like they used to.
1,DON'T Buy Sony SDM-S81!!!!,"I'm having the exact same problem. IN the begining everything was great, but after a year it is flashing green pixels around dark black contours."
1,Really BAD LCD !!!,The LCD is beginning to go bad. Green hazy areas - comes and goes. I started checking out websites to see if there were any reported problems and came accross the reviews posted here about the major problems with the LCD. I guess trying to get a replacement is not going to help.I was a real Sony fan. I've always bought Sony T.Vs. This has really ticked me off.
1,Very bad product. bad service,"I bought this monitor(SONY SDM-S81R) from DELL last december. It suddenly failed to work after 8 months. SONY sent me a refurbrished one for replacement. This one sony sent is a crapy old one. It even had a stick on it... They did not even clean it before sending out. They refuse to send a new one. The waiting time for customer service takes about 20min.I called DELL for help, but dell does not want to do anything.."
1,bad monitor,"Hi,I'm just adding my 2 cents to this monitor mess. I bought my original monitor not quite 2 years ago. Today, my 3rd replacement monitor is now going bad, and I will be contacting SONY to have a 4th monitor sent to me as replacement. Every monitor has done the exact same thing, after so much time, some type of weird greenish monitor flicker starts, usually intermittent at first, and then always. My system is on 24/7, and the monitor does shut off when not in use.This monitor is terrible. Very disappointed in Sony, the new one cost me $900.A good thing to note is that SONY has been good about shipping me replacement monitors.-Jerry"
1,Major Problems!!!,I have gone through 3 Sony SDM-S81 monitors and still can't get one that will work more than a month or two. I am trying now to get a replacement model from Sony - they have sent 3 rebuilt units that all end up doing the same thing. Screen has green-glittery haze and contoured lines moving around screen. Very disappointed with Sony for this junk of a monitor. Paid 800.00 for mis-engineered Sony mistake apparently.
4,Great balance between philosophy and practical demonstration,"Mr Daniels provides a great balance between the philosophy, the history of taijutsu, and the practical demonstration on the ninja art. Not for the DIY martial artist, but a good book for martial arts pracitioners who would like a peak at the ninja art of unarmed combat."
2,Taijutsu?,"To start the book is thin with plenty of pictures. However a majority of the moves are questionable. For instance if attacked with an overhead knive attack drop to the ground, kick the attacker in the knee then while he is on the ground get the knife away from him. The book is good for laughs but if you're looking to pick up a few moves to add to your arsenal, look elsewhere. I'm no expert on Taijutsu but it seems to me that the moves demonstrated in this book are far from what the origional practicioners intended."
4,"Good, but a bit flimsy","Delivery was prompt, fit is good and I like the shelf bra. The fabric is quite thin and has already started to lose its elasticity, but for the price, I feel it was a good purchase."
4,Three-quarters of a breathtaking album.,"I play this CD quite a bit, and each time I am equally thrilled, yet puzzled, because the I Become Small And Go sounds likes a compliation between two different bands. One of those bands is woeful (see Prison Mix and Black Hole). However, the other band, the band I like to believe is the ""real"" Creeper Lagoon, has created some truly wonderful music. Examples of this excellence include Wonderful Love, Tracy, and Dear Deadly. In addition, while each of those tunes is terrific, Dreaming Again is even better, and positively haunting in its lushness. In sum, those four songs make the album a worthwhile purchase, even if they are merely a glimpse of what is possible rather than what has heretofore been realized, as a total packaged album, by Creeper Lagoon."
5,It has it all.,What begins as an alternative cd turns into chanting by song number five. Then it goes into slightly rap. This is one of the best cd's I have bought it has everything from the songs you want to listen to over and over to Claustriphobia which is hidden late in song 11. Great cd.
3,big production,"There are several songs on this album I really like, but for the most part it sounds like a polished and faceless version of indie rock's best moments collected together on one cd, under one band's name. I don't understand why there's so much hype surrounding it."
3,Sharply sloppy,"3 1/2It's not an underground indie pop masterwork, though the handful of songs, when compelling in sequence, can make you think otherwise at times."
5,poetic vision,"This film is great poetry, a masterpiece. What may appear to our veiw of reality as being 'innate jabber' (jan 28 2002) may just be a different language - one of the soul (an often misused term) - an inner world representing feelings, intuition and feelings. The language of the artist.There is something about anglo-american consciousness that often doesn't recognize the language of the unconscious. Silence (slowness of pace) and the reality of the different layers of the psyche seem to disappear in our everyday view of the world. The layers of poetry are hidden from our perception by our own arrogance of judgement."
2,Cooking School Secrets for Real World Cooks,"Type was too small for practical use in the kitchen. Ifound the chapter on equipment to be somewhat lacking by not discussing all alternatives such as the section on cutting boards only mentions one type and does not discuss the pros and cons of wood, glass, etc. The tips are all pretty much the same tips and ideas I got from my first copy of ""Joy of Cooking"" 40 years ago. The best, and certainly not the greatest, portion of the book was the recipes. Several were very good."
4,The Backbone of the Situation,"A poet for whom the present lives in the shadow of his nation's recent memory, 1968--the year that these ""lyric skeleton keys"" are squirming to get out from under--and often with success: ""The idiotic silence of state holidays"" is for Petri an occassion to celebrate the warm, fuzzy squalor of private life; intercourse is an act of defiance, and the presence of a shoelace, which doubles as a noose, is proof positive that one is free (or, at least, unincarcerated). See the excellent ""To S.V."" for something of a Hungarian ""September 1, 1939""."
5,Easy and quick to learn,"I rented this DVD from Netflix to see if I would like it and I just love it. First you learn the positions, then you learn the movement sequence. It starts the the beginner level then you can move up the the intermediate when you are ready.In just the first week of use I was able to sit on a hard floor, which I could not do before because of back problems. Of course as with anyother program check with your doctor before starting."
1,Stephanie Foster's Masters Series Yoga on DVD,"This is a disappointing workout. It isn't true yoga. Breathing - the true ""life force"" in yoga - is not incorporated into the poses. Most of the beginning series is very slow, simple instruction on what is to come. The intermediate series are short exercise moves (with a lot of ab work), but not true asanas."
5,An Inspiring Story,"This made for TV movie originally came out in 1978 or 1979. I was 13 when I read the book in my public library and I was inspired by it.It deals with the story of an olympic miler (John Baker) who was a true champion not only as an athlate but also as a teacher, coach, and mentor.The original idea idea for the book came out of a Reader's Digest article written in the mid-1970's called ""John Baker's Last Race"". The article was very popular and many people asked for reprints of it.The nice thing about this book and the movie is that they capture the true spirit of generosity and quiet heroism of ""ordinary"" Americans like this man.In a fitting tribute, the school where Baker taught was re-named in his honor.Both the book and the movie inspired and motivated me through some tough times. I hope others will read it or watch the movie."
5,track fan,"This movie made the sport of track and field interesting, and did a great job of showing what drives runners to run. It was also a moving tale of a young man at the height of his potential, struck down by cancer. It is a well done film and a tear-jerker."
5,Towards a Better Model,"As a lay reader in the fields of psychology, I can only say that Shapiro presents a model of behaviour dynamics that is not only a vast improvement over neurochemical models, but is not at all inconsistent with them. The proposals are articulate, concise, and immediately proven through observation's new perspective. Anyone looking at the causes of neurosis, psychosis, or any mental illness should read this."
5,Classic comedy in a convenient 3-movie collection,The 3 DVDs came in 1 DVD case which I personally prefer. I don't need a case for each DVD; that would take up more space on the shelf than necessary. I love these movies and am happy to own them!
2,WS or FF,Dear editor: Why doesn't the product info indicate wether or not the films are Widescreen or Full Frame? This is the #1 product information I need when deciding on a purchase. Thanks
3,Interesting but slow.,"This is an interesting book on ghost stories however, I don't see where there is any evidence of most of these things occurring. I was under the impression that when something is labeled as ""true"" that there would be references that they were studied and proven. It is an interesting book as any ghost story would be and a good read at bedtime. I can't truly reccommend this book as ""true ghost"" stories, but they are ghost stories that are quite quaint and an easy read. Most of the stories in this book seems to have taken place in the 60's or 70's. Some even earlier as one story is told of a solider in WWII coming home. All very interesting, some light-hearted, some you are glad they didnt happen to you, but mostly just ghost stories that most of us have heard all our lives.If you are looking for ghost stories then this would be a good book for you. If you are looking for true ghost stories, ones that have been authenticated, this book is not for you."
5,More fantastic adventures with Cija!,"Cija has escaped to the city where she was born, though she does not at first know it. She returns by way of the slave market, where she is sold, and is rescued only to become a slave/whore in a brothel! As usual, she blunders from one danger to the next...There are no adventures like these on this earth, and no adventuress like Cija! She lurches from luxury to the utmost degradation in the space of a gasp. She is a Goddess, a fool, a child, and a mother wrapped in one skin, and is an utterly believable and empathic heroine. As are the other books of this saga, this is sublime fantasy/adventure!"
4,very informative,This book is very good about covering a range of topics that arise when considering to begin and entry level composite work. It also describes how far composites could be taken given the time and money.
4,Fiberglass & Composite Materials : An Enthusiast's Guide to,This is an excellent overview of materials and current practices.You might want to consider getting the book MARINE COMPOSITES (www.marinecomposites.com) on your site to compliment Mr. Aird's good book.
5,A real math book,"When math books made sense. Just the facts, no baloney, no color, no nonsense. Should be part of every household in America (3 of them in this series)."
2,"cute, but....","These earrings look cute....lever backs are a big plus. But, they are pretty heavy. I cannot wear them."
2,Not well made,"All the fire tools I bought from this company were bent, broken, or in some way rendered useless before the end of the first season. This rake bent about the third time I used it, so I knew I'd have to handle it carefully to keep using it. Eventually the head just broke off at the weld. My advice is to spend a little more, and get quality tools, unless you just want to hang some useless items around the fireplace for show."
4,Good tool for the wood stove.,"This is a simple but useful tool for me. I am a wood-stove owner--I use the ash rake to spread and smooth the bed of coals while the stove is burning, and also to help remove ashes when the stove is cold. The blade is a good width in the horizontal dimension, but I feel like this tool would be more useful if the blade were narrower in the vertical dimension."
2,shower chair,I feel the product is very poor quality. The latches on the arms pop open easily. Doesn't have the sturdiness of a quality item.
4,Works for me,"This chair has been a great help. The seat is comfortable and sturdy and it is high enough to roll over the top of a standard height toilet. The buttons to release the fold-away arms can be difficult to undo, but it is becoming easier as I use the chair a little more."
5,Jazzyness without the funny goatee beards,"Sweet and lovingly-crafted melodies abound on this fantastic album! I would recommend it most highly because it makes me think of clouds and stuff, kind of happy floaty but with quite a lot of sadness. The way the dreamy singer says about the girl putting on her wedding gown is one of my favourite moments. That, along with where the trumpets hit in on Aunt Harriet!"
3,Make Sure,"Make Sure you specify which Dodge Ram you Have Laramie King Cab, Mega Cab. These will not fit them. They need to make this available to people."
5,Cooking with Your Favorite Fairy Tale Characters,"This book rocks! It brings stories that children are familar with to life, while allowing them to enjoy healthy eats. They don't even know that what they are eating is ""good for them."" The characters become real and it makes the reader and cook feel part of the story. In addition to nutritional recipes the book also contains tid-bits about certain foods, measurements and interesting facts. A must have for any teacher, parent or child at heart."
2,Not what I had expected,"From reading the other reviewer I was really excited about this book, it sounded so perfect for my family. Now, that I am holding the book in my hands I am sorely dissappointed.I thought since the book was about books and recipes that each recipe would have a little more than a blurp about the book and it's recipe. The illustration has a lot to be desired, to me it looks like 20's & 30's clip art with colors that are just way off.Granted, I haven't tried the recipes, maybe they are fantastic. Just so far at first look I am not impressed. If this book sounds interesting, see if your local library has a copy or order it at your local bookstore and look at it before buying."
4,River thunder,"This book is for anyone who likes an outdoor adventure. It is about white water rafting and how friends must depend on each other to survive. It is one of the best books I have read in my life. It is a book that describes real dangers of the outdoors. The characters learn the hard way, how people must work together. I think everyone should read it."
5,Awesome book! you will never want this story to end!,"I was thrilled when i found out that there was a sequel to ""Down River"" and i knew i had to read it. ""Thunder river"" is an awesome book! i could not put it down. it is written beautifully and i never wanted the story to end! by the end you will be wishing fo another sequel!"
1,So. Many. Spelling. Errors.,"And I have only gotten to the second chapter so far. Can't believe I paid $7 for something so poorly presented. The story has great potential, I was really excited to continue the story from ""Downriver"" but all the typos and errors are really annoying. Seriously, who typed this book up? There are so, SO many typing errors, it really detracts from the story. It's not even just a letter here or there wrong, although there are actually many letters all over in this ""book"" that are wrong, but whole words are wrong. Like instead of ""the"" it says ""die"", twice so far, barely to chapter 2. How do you even mistake those two words for each other?? Did someone not proof read their work? Or are there no editors with kindle publications? What a rip off."
3,"Great sequel, horrible Kindle formatting","This is an excellent sequel to Downriver. It continues the story of the Hoods in the Woods as they return to the Grand Canyon and continue to face personal and group conflicts. There is more technical information about the river itself, which is interesting. The formatting for the book is horrible. There is no chapter index and it is riddled with spelling errors. There enough errors that it detracts from the content. Hopefully, at some point they will fix this."
4,river thunder,River Thunder by will hobbs is written as as a realistic fiction. Its about some friends that go white water rafting in the calorado river. Jessie is the main character and has to overcome her fears of flipping over in her raft.The plot of the story is to try to liver going through the big rapids at record levels. If one of them were to get flipped over they would iether die or get siriuosly hurt.I liked this book and think it would be good for 5-7th graders. I liked it because i always thought it would be cool to go white water rafting and beacause it is an action adventure book.
3,"Study the pictures, forget the essays","Ms. Mowry is a talented artist, with great finesse in shaping dramatic landscapes. This book is filled with fine, instructive examples of her work. She does tend to get carried away, though, as she writes about the significance of Art, and Life, and Stuff. All that palaver tends to wear thin after awhile. But the pictures are well worth studying."
3,Textbookish but useful,"This is a book about an important topic - the transitions compnies must go through, from the struggle for surival to becoming a large, mature company. It contains a very useful and credible model in the form of a pyramid depicting the 'normal' growth stages of a company, beginning with defining product/market and ending with establishing a corporate culture. Two noticeable shortcomings: the authors seem to largely ignore strategy and business models in their description of the growth path, and second, it is written in a very lieless and textbookish style. The management jargon rolls on and on, dulling the reader's mind, and making him wonder if he is reading the same page again and again. The entire approach is extremely conventional, with very little appreciation for more modern theories of management. Overall, a good book, not great."
4,Review of 'Bad Brothers' Ronny Jordan/DJ Krush,"I found this album browsing in Picadilly records, Manchester and had to buy it because of the collaboration of two of my favourite artists, I thought it had to be a winnerBasically, the quality of the album comes from Jordan's album tracks, being that the remix is quite a subtle one, Krush has chosen the tunes with the grooves.The grooves are cool, mainly laidback funky Hip Hop, particularly the track 'Season for change' with Guru.So What is obviously a classic funky tune and all the tracks are well listenable. Not as (amazing)wierd as Krush's usual exploits but his input is valid enough for a shared title."
5,Great for beading and other small crafts,"I have eight of these bins for my beading supplies and I love them! The moveable dividers are great for different sized beads and supplies. And the translucent plastic allows me to figure out quickly which bin I need. The only downside is I wish they provided a few spare dividers with each bin, but apparently they do sell them separately."
3,Art bin box compartment LIE!!!,The title describing the item is a lie. Its actually 43 compartments in all that can be created not 48. they say 4-48 compartments in the title description.
3,Strong but very runny and it dries an unusual color,"This glue makes strong joints, but it seems to be less dense than the Titebond II that I usually use. This results in repeated wipe ups when I use it for biscuit joints. This glue, like all others, is not really stainable enough to meet my expectations. Small point, but it dries a very unappealing orange color. It does scrape off well after drying if you use that method for clean up."
4,Bardo Pond - 'Dilate' (Matador Records) 4 1/2 stars,"Some have said that 'Dilate' is perhaps Bardo Pond's most experimental CD, so far. Great 2001 release, as it's the Philly 'noisy psych drone' band's sixth effort. Tracks I dug the absolute most here were ""Sunrise"", the Middle Eastern-inspired ""Swig"" as well as the CD's two stunning epics,clocking in at eleven minutes,plus each ""Inside"" and ""Ganges"". As for myself,I more or less have to be IN the mood to listen to this sort of music. VERY worth while indeed,Line-up:Isobel Sollenberger-flute,violin&vocals,John Gibbons-guitar&synth,Michael Gibbons-guitar,Clint Takeda-bass and Ed Farnsworth-drums.Should appeal,very much so to fans of Kinski,Asteroid #4,Hash Jar Tempo and Flying Saucer Attack."
2,Refine the instrumental excess and loose the rest,"2 1/2With the exception of a few great, murkily documented guitar ideas and some occasionally great shading, these druggy drones rarely go past self-serving, with occasional genre flirtations and much inner Kim Gordon channeling dragging Dilate towards the indulgent. Pity, since the band specializes in going down exotically-tinged k-holes of sound with much conviction."
4,Sonic Youth meets Godspeed You ! Black Emporer,Very nice stuff. Quite beautiful in a noisy kind of way. The music tends to keep you feeling like you just finished off a 20 sack of kind herb. A nice ride.
5,Dogwood one of the best bands out there,I have been a die hard dogwood fans since their roots began and cannot wait when a new album is released because they never fail to amaze me. Each dogwood album is great and is unique from the last. Im glad SEISMIC has a greater punk sound than the previous two albums. to see how great this band is download Conscience in a CAve and Absolution from mp3.com then you will know that you need to buy this album because it is awesome. thank you dogwood for never disappointing me with a bad album because everything is great. god bless
5,Great final album,"This album has the intensity Dogwood fans are used to. The production is polished, but I do wish they would have had the Descendents guy produce them again to give them just a little more... I don't know what it is, but ""Building a Better Me"" had it.The lyrics are consistently Christ-centered, which really makes the music more powerful, I think.The music took me a few listens to really get into, but now I really like it. The old guitarist Sean (now the producer) was my favorite (I wonder why he didn't play on this album).Josh's vocals are top-notch. Really very good.Tracks 1-7 are all great, 8 is slow comparatively and my least favorite, 9 is great musically and lyrically, 10 is good, 11 is like 8, and 12 is awesome. So overall, strong album. Favorite band, hands down."
2,Nooooooooo........,"Dogwood....the name brings up good memories of a band that used to be incredible. Sadly those days have come and gone and now they have released a bad cd. There were a couple songs on here that where pretty good but most of them just seemed very mediocre. Yes back when I was younger Dogwood used to be one of my favorite bands and each cd out by them was fantastic, but with all the good members gone they seemed to have gone downhill. I almost wish they had just called it quits after Matt Aragon since they would have left with a good reputation still. It also doesn't help that the first time I saw them live they put on a marvelous show but the last time I saw them it was the worst concert I have ever been to. Hopefully if they release a brand new cd it will be good and restore my faith in them."
5,Seeing through a glass darkly.,"Often in our walk with God we are given guidelines and standards that we ought to obey and live by. Often times the reasons for these ""principles"" are cloudy and obscure, such as seeing through a darkly tinted glass. This book explains, in easy to understand terms, the reasons for the do's and dont's on many of these issues that promote godly living. People usually do not mind obeying truths, when they understand them. This book bridges that gap and explains in easy to understand, laymens terms. You walk away from this book saying to yourself ""That makes perfectly good sense. I wonder why I never heard it that way before."""
1,quite disapointed,"I purchased this version of all the books of Poes work because it was one of the few to have stories and poems, as well as a working table of contents. It has no table of contents, let alone a working one. The font is strange and the line notations are distracting. I hope there is a better version somewhere."
5,Beautiful!,"Just received these as a gift. We've been using cheaper sets for the last 10 years and finally decided to go for a more-than-$75-set to ensure we aren't replacing every couple of years!These are amazing! I'm quite impressed with the weight of each knife and plan on adding the steak set to compliment it. The block is made of bamboo and has a unique, classy look to it.I've cut some pretty standard stuff... (Fruit, meat, chicken, and bread), but can't believe the huge difference between these and my ""chef's choice"" set."
1,Definitely not bold colors.,"I've purchased these 3d paint pens before, but they have definitely changed the product on the inside of the box. The colors you get will look nothing like the picture. The box is the same, but inside the colors are a very soft pastel and could not be called bold by any stretch of the imagination. I ordered a second pack hoping that maybe the first one was just a mistake. Nope. Now I have two boxes of pastel 3d paint pens when all I wanted was bold colors."
2,dissapointed!,"I was introduced to Giant Sunflower Seeds while on a fishing trip in Oregon. I liked how large they were, (and not too much salt). When I returned home they were hard to find. I went on line. I think I have ordered 3 times, may be 4. Each time the seeds get smaller, and smaller. The last I got in Jan. were no different than any number of others sell. I had written the Co. about this last year, got no response. What set off this writing is. Today I was going to reorder. The price for 6.5 oz. bags was $48.00. As I dug out my invoice from my Jan. order, I found they were $41.00 then. I am old but not stupid. I am sure I can settle for this product from many companies that advertise for some 25% less."
1,Don't buy this book,"I have no idea what the guy who rated this book ahead of me is talking about. This book doesn't have any good material on tactics, half of it is bear statistics and half of it is choosing your weapon( 4chapters). Do not buy this book, save your money and time."
1,Unreadable collection of xeroxed newspaper articles,"Although the message may be important, this book is so poorly reproduced as to render it unreadable. It consists of bad xerox copies of newspaper articles by and about the author. All of the material is available on the internet in more readable form. It is repetitive, self-absorbed and quite unacceptable in its present form. If someone would re-type the newspaper articles so that they were readable or would just download the articles from the internet directly to print it would be worthwhile reading on this topic."
5,Most damning evidence of all that aspartame is harmful.,"""Deadly Deception - Story of Aspartame, written and compiled by Mary Nash Stoddard, is undisputedly the most damning single repository of evidence available that the artificial sweetener aspartame is toxic to many and even deadly to some. - The WINDS 2/19/99 [World Internet News Service]"
4,Royal Rumble 2002 Review,"I saw this event live on PPV and let me tell you, it is one of the better Royal Rumble events ever put together. Featured matchups are:The Rock vs. Chris Jericho for the Undisputed WWF ChampionshipEdge vs. William Regal for the Intercontinental TitleSpike Dudley & Tazz defend the WWF Tag Team Championship against The Dudley BoyzJazz challenges Trish Stratus for the Women's TitleRic Flair vs. Vince McMahon in a street fightAnd the Royal Rumble Match which features the likes of Stone Cold, Triple H, Rob Van Dam, The Undertaker, Booker T and Kane in perhaps the most star-studded Royal Rumble match of all time."
4,Good rumble!,this rumble started out with 3 bad to okay matches. then it got a good streetfight. a great title match and the best royal rumble match ever. overall this is one of the better rumbles!
5,Sweet,"...This Pay Per View was the best Pay Per View I have seen. The Royal Rumble match is great. Mr Perfect, Val Venis, Goldust and Godfather all return in this match. Rikishi drew number 1 and Goldust drew number 2. It was down to Triple H and Kurt Angle. Kurt thought he had eliminated Triple H but he didnt and Triple H comes back in the ring and eliminates Kurt to go on to Wrestlemania X-8!!!! Chris Jericho also defeated The Rock to retain the Undisputed Title with help from the Lance Storm and Christian. In a street fight, Ric Flair defeated Vince McMahon. Both men were bloodied up pretty bad. Spike Dudley and Tazz defeated Dudley Boys to retain the Tag Titles. William Regal defeated Edge with help from the brass knuckles to win the IC title. Also, Trish defeated Jazz to retain the Women's title. Buy this DVD because it will be worth it."
4,Great way to get your feet wet.,"If you want to get your feet wet or you've been tasked with deploying a snort system, this is a good way to start. In the typical, humorous, ""for dummies"" style, this book walks you through getting, setting up and using Snort and the ACID console.The book also covers how to maintain and tweak the system, once it is up and running. A good effort by the authors."
2,Outdated....,This guide was great... 7 years ago I am sure... But MySQL has changed drastically since that time and those sections are rather useless... I wish there was something current...
3,"Good, but Not Complete","I purchased this book because I needed to configure Snort on a Linux server at work. I did get some good tips about Snort from this book. However, it did not clearly convey things like you don't need a database to run Snort and that you can run it from a command line. I had to do alot of research on the web and finally got Snort to run on the box. So as the title states, I felt that this book was good but it wasn't complete in it's explanation of Snort."
2,Poor Quality Cartridge,"I have used Rhinotek cartridges in the past. They are in every way equal to the OEM cartridges. What I received from this vendor was not from Rhinotek. It had plastic where there should be metal, locating pins and other external parts. The images have light bands of black about 25% of the time and there are occasional areas where the toner is missing. To be fair, it was good enough that I did not return but since they substituted a cheaper cartridge, I should have. I will not be ordering from TonerDeal in future."
2,All photo's are B&W,"All pics are in black and white, this is a multiple angle pose book. an original anime artist may gain ""some"" inspiration from the series of basic photo shoots."
4,Powerful album,"This is the sort of album that should be made more often. The guitars have resonance and power and sound like they know what they're doing. Added to Nick Cave's voice and the effect is wonderful. Admittedly they might suffocate the vocals somewhat but given Cave's lyrical work, it almost seems appropriate. The CD is a little short however ( just clocking in at a half an hour ).The DVD is amazing - I've probably played this more times than the CD itself. OK it's about 17 minutes long but what you get pure controlled chaos. The band don't talk to the audience or even themselves apart from Thomas Wydler once shouting "" eins, zwei, drei, vier "" but the musicianship is wonderful.Of course this is going to be bought as an look as to see how The Bad Seeds came about. But it easily stands alone by itself. Recommended regardless of the history behind it"
5,Very Classy,"I have seen these jackets around for a while now. I was looking for something, not as heavy as my textile riding suit but would still be stylish, yet more comfortable than leather. The jacket seems to fit the niche for around town and short runs on warmer days. I must also say the material is very easy on your paint as well."
5,Informative and Inspiring Sermons,"This is an outstanding collection of sermons by a keen intellect and brilliant preacher. The sermons included in this volume cover major events in American and world history from 1933 to 1980, including the Holocaust, the civil rights movement, and the Vietnam War, among others.Although the selections in this book are organized largely around then-contemporary events, the themes are timeless and timely. These sermons by Rabbi Harold Saperstein, a leading Reform Jewish rabbi, are insightful, inspiring, and passionately written.Rabbi Marc Saperstein has added excellent introductions and footnotes to the sermons which provide historical context and pertinent commentary.The sermons reflect an extraordinary mind and heart dealing with a succession of difficult issues, from a background of knowledge, wisdom, and ethical concern.In sum, an oustanding book."
5,Supper fast delivery,"Thanks for great supper fast delivery! Great product ,helping my muscles recover after workout quickly . Also good for so many things as per Dr. Oz show. Protects heart, eyes , aging and so many others. Thanks !"
3,Good entertainment,"The acting and stories of both movies are a bit weak but fun enough to burn some spare time. I have seen much worse come out of mainstream Hollywood, so a rating of 3 stars is definitely well-deserved."
1,Low budget,"The products arrived on time in good condition. I think these two movies are not well made, cheap, and poor acting. I will not be watching them for the second time."
5,Best books on the subject ever,"I am surprised that there has only been one review of SUPERNATURAL LITERATURE OF THE WORLD. The three-volume set is easily the most comprehensive coverage of supernatural and horror fiction yet published. The many articles are intelligently written and accessible. All criticism (even when you don't agree with it) is well reasoned, and when the boot is put in, it is well deserved. S.T. Joshi's own articles in the book are so good that I am looking forward to his upcoming UNUTTERABLE HORROR: A HISTORY OF SUPERNATURAL FICTION, due out from PS Publishing later this year."
1,Never Mine,It may motivate you to learn more about Feng Shui but it will not teach you anything. It's like a long TV info-mercial. Try borrowing it from your local library.
5,Nice watch for a great Price. Invicta is stepping up in the world of watches.,"A few years ago I wouldn't ever think of buying an Invicta. We bought 2 of our kids an Invicta and they turned out to work so well that we bought 3 more. This Christmas we just bought two more (this one and a ladies modle). My wife has had hers for 1.5 years and it is still working great. No problems. She has over a dozen watches that are way more expensive, but her Invicta is water resistant to 100M and she loves to use it while swimming and working around water."
2,2 Watches - Both didn't work,"The first watch, and the one Amazon sent to replace the first didn't work. The first lost about 1-minute per hour of time and then all together quit working. The second didn't work at all. How can you ship a watch and not check to be sure it is working? I am most disappointed in Amazon, I have several Invicta and they are nice watches."
1,Disappointment - Band Broke in a Week - Consider Disposable,"Invicta watches are very pretty and priced well, but buy one only if you can consider it disposable. Husband has only worn this watch for a week before the metal band broke. Warranty repairs are not available in the US (Pay $28, ship it to Florida and the Invicta service center ships it overseas for repair), can take the ""industry standard"" of 90 days, and require a minimum shipping fee of $28. Taking it to a local jeweler automatically voids the warranty so that is not an option either. I thought it was a fluke when the band broke after a year on hubby's previous Invicta which is why I considered them when ordering a replacement. At this point, I would be better off buying him a watch from Wal-Hell because at least I would not be surprised if it turned out to be poor quality and ""disposable"". This is definitely a case of ""You get what you pay for"" and this Amazon bargain isn't a bargain at all."
5,Great value,This watch is a bit smaller than the typical men's invicta which makes it a bit more versatile. I'm a police officer and wear it at work daily. It looks great and keeps good time. It's construction is very sturdy. The stainless steel band is rugged yet not overbearing. Overall I'm very pleased. I bought the ladies version for my wife
3,Looks Great......but I got a Dud!,"This watch is really nice looking. It's not too large for my very thin 18 year old son's wrist. He gets lots of compliments. Unfortunately, it stopped keeping the correct time after the first month. Advice to others?.....make sure you fill out the online warranty. I didn't and now my son is stuck with a great-looking non-functional watch."
2,"I love Jodi Thomas, but not this time","I couldn't get into these characters. They were not interesting to me. Clingy, yes.As a rule, I buy Jodyi's books off the shelf without a review, I have regrets for that decision. I will still read her, but maybe not the next brother in this series."
4,"yo, you mp3 kids...","This my friends, is what is to be expected. For those of you who have every one of there albums, sad sappy sucker is a worthy edition to the precious stack. These recordings are a documentation of the bands first projects and some of those are basement projects- expectedly with basement recording quality and feel. ""BAD REPRESENTATION IS BETTER THAN NO REPRESENTATION,"" a wise man once said. I'm an mp3 kid and i had 90% of the stuff already, yet it was still worth it for me to smell that Isaac Brock art on the virgin cd cover sleeve. if you aren't a die hard, spending the money won't be worth it to you."
3,Warning,This CD is a a bunch of their early stuff before they were more polished. I really didn't like it when I first listened to it but a couple songs do grow on you.
4,lo-fi modest mouse,"Much of this sounds so much like early Built to Spill that you'd swear Doug Martsch was on back-up vocals.This is nothing like later/current Modest Mouse, and, if you've never heard ""This Is a Long Drive..."" or any of the earlier EP stuff, then don't buy this without listening to it first.Modest Mouse fans will appreciate the new material, but this is VERY lo-fi and doesn't have that quirk and introspection that some of their slightly later stuff had."
3,It's Okay...,"There are some songs which really do reflect what is being called ""true Modest Mouse"". However... the end of the album seems to just be filled with 30 second badly recorded songs without much substance. It's like they wrote a paper the night before it was due... starts off strong, ends weak."
4,"not the best modest mouse album, but good","this is modest mouse for people with short attention spans. most of the songs are really short, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. The unlisted fourth track (not Point A to Point B, which is actually track five) is quite catchy and great, and Dukes up, Worms vs. Birds and Four Fingered Fisherman are simply some great indie pop songs. Though much of the album is distinctly Modest Mouse, there are some things that set it apart from their other albums, specifically the prominence of accordian and the aforementioned shortness of songs. But Isaac Brock's great vocals are there as always."
3,Leftovers,The band kicks ...- don't get me wrong. This album sounds like clips and scratch-notes from the basement though.
3,FOR FANS ONLY,Don't buy this expecting this to be a representation of Modest Mouse. Most these songs are little quirky tracks that are hit and miss i really couldnt call this an alblum there are a few good songs on here but mostly just short stuff. Your better off getting Lonesome Crowded West or Moon and Antarctica i prefer lonesome though
1,Sad it is,The title of this album fits it very well. Modest Mouse should have just kept it mysteriously floating around the net. Get the Moon and Antarctica instead.
1,Horrible,"There are maybe one or two songs on here that I like but man did MM really miss the boat on this one. They're my favorite band but it seems like this is one CD they just didn't put any thought or effort into, it just sounds terrible."
3,"Alright, but no Lonesome Crowded West","Sad Sappy Sucker is a so so Modest Mouse Album. The album is on and off providing examples of both spectacular songs and not-so-spectacular songs. The clear cut best track would be Worms Vs. Birds with other highlights comming from Path of Least Resistance, From Point a to Point B, Dukes Up, Race Car Grin You Ain't No Landmark, and Secret Angent X-9. If you already like Modest Mouse and enjoy some of their older stuff like 'Lonesome Crowded West' or 'This is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About' Then I'd recomend exploring this abum. If your a fan of 'Good News for People Who Love Bad News' and you're looking to explore or if this is your first Modest Mouse album, then the best choice would be Lonesome Crowded West."
2,I am Obviously Lost,"Where to begin....well for starters this cd is REALLY bad. I love Modest Mouse (Lonesome Crowded West still being the most played cd of my collection), but this is bad. Listening to Worms Vs. Birds I thought 'This is pretty good' then I heard the rest of the cd.I for one, do not see a brilliance here. There is one song that he just repeates Ping Pong! Ok possibly funny for 5-10 seconds but its almost a minute long. Issac's voice always is on a thin line of beautiful and intolerable (I know sounds weird but really its the truth). The biggest problem is the overall lack of song stucture, not to say that it has to follow the same formula, but seriously! Nothing holds the songs together, and the emotion for me just isn't there like it was in songs like trailer trash, or anything like LCW.Anyway, Sad Sappy Sucker, not even compared to LCW, is unlistenable at best. There are amazing Modest Mouse material, this however, isn't one of them."
1,Sad,"I am a huge Modest Mouse fan, and i love every album, ep, and split ep that they have. This is not a Modest Mouse release. This is a horrible way for somone to make money off of a great band. Its like they went and found the smalllest chunks of anything that had to do with the band, and then put it on a cd. The last six tracks are 30 seconds long. I would advise no one to waste their money on this cd. There are only four songs worth listening to, and those topped out at 1:20."
3,"For ten bucks, what the heck","Amazon has knocked five bucks off the list price of this book which just about makes it worth it. As others have noted, if you're a true MPFC fan, you've seen the movie so many times that you know the script by heart already. You also probably own a copy of the film. So why do you need this book? I dunno. There are no new photos, no commentary... If you know someone who is new to the world of MPFC, it's a safe bet that you'll lend them the video and not the screenplay. On the other hand, for the collector of all things Monty, for ten bucks, this will fill the bill. So what the heck? Go for it."
2,watch for out of print version,"Like a previous reviewer, I highly recommend the version of the script that is crammed with extras such as Terry Gilliam's sketches and a facsimile of the screenplay with edits. It's a treasure."
2,"Great photography, average acting","The most striking thing about this film is the photography. Tiny gestures are magnified in close-up; the composition is interesting overall. However, the script is slightly over-poetic and stilted in places. Add to this some hammy acting on the part of the actress who plays Freida, plus some upstaging from some heady drag queens...and everything comes down a few notches. In spite of this, the boat scene with Freida and Colin works very well. In summary: A thoughtful movie which might have been better."
2,GOOD INTENTIONS BUT SLOW PLOT,"I FOUND THE MOVIE TO BE SLOW MOVING WITH TOO MUCH TIME SPEND ON DETAILS NOT IMPORTANT TO THE PLOT. OVERVIEW THE ""IDEA"" BEHIND THE MOVIE WAS GOOD AND COLIN'S CHARACTER WAS DEVELOPED WELL; BUT THE MOVIE COULD USE MOVE INTENSE DIALOGUE AND LESS NOT NEEDED FILLER."
1,For masochists,"Black and white film with action as vivid as a dead cow. Wth people care and create such tedious things?If you want to watch it, you need either huge amount of coffee or an alarm clock, which wakes you up now and then.Once again a movie overloaded with quasi intelligent dialogues, very slow takes and amatourish actors. However, it doesn't hurt to watch actors playing two leading parts. At least they did their best."
4,"An honest, heart-warming story with amazing cinematography.","A surprisingly enjoyable low-budget film. The romantic storyline tugs at the viewer's heartstrings as we see the torment faced by a young man unsure of his wants and hopes of the future. Anyone who has ever been in an intimate relationship will be able to appreciate the joys, sorrows and struggles depicted in this film."
4,Very well captured,The complete movie happens in a single day and I thought overall they did an excellent job to capture the emotions and feelings. It's an excellent story and I felt so real about it. Very well photographed and directed. I loved it.
1,Apart is right! about 10 minutes into the movie!,"The movie was done completely in black and white, which normally wouldn't matter to me. The only difference is that this movie seemed more like a look in the lives of disfunctional people through a convenient store security camera. About the most interesting part of the whole movie was seeing the main character's best friend come in to a thrift shop to find poka dot shoes to match her poka dot dress, if you call that interesting."
5,Beautiful knitting patterns & writer's journal,I love these patterns for beautiful and unusual hand-knitted socks. I'm a new knitter and haven't yet made socks but read so much about the designers earlier book The Sock Calendar. Then saw this new one and had to get it.The patterns are very easy to read and follow even for a beginner. The colorful photos are pretty as can be. I highly recommend this book to anyone knitter and especially to people who are into the new craze of knitting socks.
4,"Quick, visceral read","The language of this book is image laden and visceral. Not for the squeamish. The plot is pretty non-existent, but I don't think it was worse for that. The book reads so quickly and smoothly and transports you to the places and thoughts of the characters so vividly. A good rainy sunday book."
2,"Tries hard, falls flat","Darcey Steinke certainly deserves an A for effort. She's nailed the plot elements necessary to be hailed as a great dark artist in this end of the age - child abuse, dead moms and absent dads, detached sexy teenage girls, philosophical/religious critique of the cult of the suburbs... I have nothing against these elements in and of themselves, although some of them are starting to be overdone.Unfortunately, her style combines Anne Rice's obsessive-compulsive love of irrelevant detail, the insistant grimyness of a latter-day rock star, and a Joyce-esque refusal to clearly distinguish thought from actuality, while lacking the redeeming gifts of any of the above-mentioned artists.Darcey Steinke will probably write something good someday, probably a short story. Keep your eye out for that. Don't bother with this."
3,"""...at the First national Bank""","Sorry, just couldn't resist that old joke. Anyway, I found the book short enough to read in one day, which is good, because if it had been any longer I don't think that I would have finished it. That's not to say that the book didn't have it's merits, it's just that I really couldn't get myself involved with the characters.The author never fleshes out the people in the book, even the main protagonists. We never learn their ages or really anything else about them that might make us care for them. When you can't ""bond"" with the characters, you can't really work up any concern for what happens to them, and even at the end I wasn't fully engaged in the book. I needed to read something to pass the time,however, and this was at least adequate in that respect."
4,Suburban Gothic,"This book was my first by Darcey Steinke and it really tears into you. I enjoyed the way the language and imagery flowed and seemed very natural. I agree with the other positive reviews about the fantasy sequences and the extremely dark situations in this suburban wasteland. Jesus Saves will make you reread the ending, much like the recent ""Sixth Sense"""
4,O'Connor for the nineties-- Steinke's visceral sacrament.,"The visceral, the violent and the bloody always find their place in sacramental art, and that's what has happened in ""Jesus Saves,"" one of the best pieces of sacramental fiction I have read. I can only think to compare this work to Flannery O'Conner in its engaging prose and extremely intelligent religious sensibility. Steinke does for the suburban wasteland what O'Connor did for the backwater Southern community. Her grapplings with the problem of evil and the problem of the megachurch are deeply gratifying. Highly recommended."
2,dazed and confused,"I read many books with this similar teen angst psychological thinking type and they all leave me with something specific. Jesus Saves was different. I read it rather fast, but was not happy with it when i was done. It was to imaginary from Sandy's view and i didnt really comprehend what everything meant. The plot was nonexistant and i still do not understand the point."
5,The Best of Furry?,"There's a CD out there that claims that Furry was in his prime in the 1920s. After listening to these recordings from the 60s, I have to disagree. Age did nothing but add strength and poignancy to Furry's voice, and his guitar work is as hypnotic as ever. On top of that, the sound quality is superb. I prefer these songs to his ""Shake Em on Down"" recordings because they have an intimate, right next to you sound, whereas the Shake Em tracks have this echo on them, like they were recorded in a bathroom or something. Another reviewer commented that this added an otherworldly feeling to the production, but I think it does nothing but detract from the performances. The blues aren't supposed to be otherworldly, they're supposed to be very earthy and immediate. Check out this CD first instead."
5,Good Morning Judge,"""Good Morning Judge"" is not only one of the best tracks Furry Lewis ever recorded, but one of the best recordings of the Country Blues revival. ""Farewell, I'm Growing Old"" is a touching, beautiful work, and Furry only fails on ""Old Hobo"", his version of Jimmie Rodgers' ""Waiting For A Train"", simply because, at Furry's age, he was not able to yodel very well. This is an extremely enjoyable cd, especially considering how it was produced by the Fat Possum Record company, which rarely produces anything even remotely related to Blues. Fans of this disc should also check out the Fred McDowell and Joe Callicott releases from the George Mitchell collection. Furry's take on Blind Lemon Jefferson's ""See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"" is also noteworthy."
4,a good resource..,..I originally checked out this book from my library & as a result decided to purchase a copy for myself. It has good ideas & straight forward instructions. I can easily elaborate on the items in this book to make them my own. Great addition to my craft library!
3,Nemesis,"Found the tape at the Salvation Army for .50 cents about a month ago, not sure who Axe was. Nemesis is a typical 80's metal album. Their style fits in with groups like Motley Crue, Great White, Poison, W.a.s.P. etc. Not knowing anything about the band I didn't have very high expectations from the album. It was surprisenly good. Songs like Heat in the STreet and Young Hearts just rock. The album never really gets dull, just sounds similiar to the rest of the groups of their time, so a pretty cool album if you can find it at a good price."
4,1980's Memories,"This music was great in the early 1980's when I was a kid, and it still sounds great today!"
5,"When the Student Is Ready, the Teacher Will Appear.","If the writings of Joel S. Goldsmith are destined to guide you along the Spiritual Path, you will find one of his books in your hands, when the time is right for you. I discovered this book after thirty years as a student of metaphysics. In this book, Goldsmith ties up all the loose ends and answers all the unanswered questions that still lingered after such extensive study. It provides the missing link. I realized after reading this book, that most of us spend our whole lives searching for God, and ""The Spiritual Power of Truth"" shows exactly where to find It. A most profound book for any serious student of Spiritual Truth."
4,Just right,"This is a perfect size for Body with zoom lens, 2 small lenses and a small video camcorder. You can even strap on a tripod. It's a manageable size for every day use."
5,Serious about food and wine,"If you love to eat and drink in style, then this book is for you. Refreshingly straight-forward and unpretentious, ""The Ultimate Wine Lover's Guide"" not only covers the spectrum of fine wines, but tells you how to pair them with what you're cooking tonight. A great value!"
1,Who else,This book was very interesting - she had some good stories but I'd rather depend on God's will
4,I liked it,"I thought this book was a great start in visualization. It gives a good description to layout a manifesting journal, meditation/visualization techniques and some more reading recommendations."
4,Great Performances,"The Cleveland and Christoph von Dohnanyi provide very interesting performances on these discs. I especially enjoy the powerful (and thoughtful at the same time) performance of the 4th symphony. I have never heard this symphony performed better. I'm not sure exactly why, but the performance just ""works"". I can listen this recording day after day without tiring of it. In that sense it is definitely a recording you can ""live with"".The 3rd symphony and Violin concertos are also strong though I have had heard more convincing performances. For a very different (and I believe best ever) recording of the violin concerto check out the 1994 Joshua Bell london album.If you are a fan of the Brahms symphonies or Violin conerto don't hesitate to buy this CD."
4,Good but a little too orange,"Overall, this tea has a really great taste, just like the restaraunt-made ones. I would caution against spilling it anywhere, seeing as it stains orange everything it touches."
2,Green tea + too much yellow food coloring,This doesn't taste like the Thai Iced Tea I get at restaurants. Maybe it's all the yellow food coloring that throws things off for me. I really feel like there is too much dye in this tea - to the point that I didn't use the other three bags. That just can't be good for you.
1,Our government would never lie to us!,I'm outraged to think that someone might even suggest that our government isn't completely honest with us. I have to agree with the government official who gave it 1 star.
1,fell apart,"it looked cool, but it fell apart. i had to put it in the shop to get all the links redone. once again you get what you pay for."
1,Author stole title directly from a well-known book on childhood psychology,"How nice to just lift the title of the book directly from an extremely popular book called ""The Drama of the Gifted Child."" I wonder if the author hoped that she would sell more books based on name-association...How about trying not to steal someone else's title and actually create your own. It makes me wonder what else from the book was stolen...."
2,A Great Example of Why Emotional Distance is a Must for Nonfiction,"It quickly became clear that the author felt too strongly and personally about this subject to be clearheaded about it. It suffers from poor reporting, awkward writing, and negligent editing. The way she repeatedly harps on how the kids in the book may be gifted and even enjoying life but they are ""geeky"" or ""not cool"" is juvenile and ridiculous. She should have written a memoir first.It's too bad because this is a book that is begging to be written properly. The subject is very timely."
3,"This is a book about bad parenting, be the child gifted or not.","This has nothing to do with parents providing healthy opportunities for their children to grow.This is about her own childhood and other extreme, unbalanced childhood lives.This very well could be ""Hothouse Kids: The Dilemma of the Soccer-Parent Coached Child"" or the ""Dilemma of the Stagemothered CHild""I give three stars because any parent needs to read this to see how an unbalanced child turns to negativity.With this knowledge and giftedness she claims to have had; where did common sense come into play and therapy perhaps, so that she could heal?"
3,A challenging book for parents,"It is quickly evident that the author is too close to the issues she presents and that she is very bitter about her childhood. I also didn't care for the condescending attitude she takes about almost everyone she encounters in her research.Unlike others reviewers, I thought she did come to a general conclusion, that gifted children generally benefit from gifted education programs but not the pressure of wearing the mantle of ""prodigy."" I especially appreciated the favorable description of Iles School in Springfield, Illinois.As a parent of two gifted children, I found a lot of food for thought in this book: topics that led to self-reflection about my motivations and actions."
1,Drivel,"I bought this book for a little light weekend reading. I was intrigued by the timely premise of pedophiles infiltrating the Catholic church, and I always enjoy books that take place in NYC.However I could barely make my way through the book. At times, the constant cliches literally made me feel a little gagging feeling in my throat. And it was boring!! The plot totally fell apart in the second half of the book. IT turned out to be a rainy weekend...I only finished it out of extreme extreme boredom. it was physically painful at times (it also made me feel sad that I could actually be THAT bored so as to complete such a book).This is the sort of extremely badly written and disappointing book that makes you want to actually go back to the store and get a refund."
3,Provocative book,"I will not go into the plot since that has all ready been discussed. I thought this was a provacative book since it touched upon several ""hot button"" pedophile priests, nature or nuture in creating criminals. I actually had to check several times to make sure this was not a true crime story since Carlo writes as if it is real. Mildly disturbing due to the molestation issue. All in all a good read."
5,Intriguing,Predators & Prayers is an intriguing and disturbing account straight from todays' headlines. A true page turner that kept me in suspense from beginning to end. This novel will be a subject for our next book club.
5,Page Turner,"I absolutely loved Predators & Prayers! This book is a page turner, I could not put it down. I enjoyed the characters and locations, especially Carlo's description of the Amalfi coast. All in all, quite amazing."
5,I fell in love with Escaflowne,"an excellent series, I would place this with Gundam Wing for one of the best Anime of all time. This series have drama, love, action, a great plot, depth, well I don't know what else to say but it is really great. No american cartoons will ever come close to series like this or gundam wing. If you are into or just getting started with Anime, Escaflowne is the series to HAVE!"
1,WARNING: NOT THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE VERSION,"I saw Escaflowne for the first time over 10 years ago. Having had a fit of nostalgia, I was quite happy initially to find that Unbox had the series. And since the credit blurb had Japanese names on it, I assumed that this would be the Japanese-language/English subtitled version. Wrong! It's the awfully dubbed English language version. The Japanese version makes the dialogue cute, but the English one renders it positively intolerable. Unbox should really start start notifying customers about what language versions they have. To make it worse, while I had originally just planned on buying the first episode to see how it was, I accidentally pressed ""buy entire season"" instead. Which I realized a split second later. And there's NO WAY to cancel an Unbox order, even if your catch your mistake BEFORE the thing starts downloading!! So, on top of everything else, that was $40 down the drain. A REALLY expensive mistake."
5,"Okay, so I'm biased","I'll admit it. This is the first and only anime series that I watched from beginning to end. I'm not an otaku and I watch anime on a very limited basis.But this series rocked the house. People should see it. There are scenes of true beauty here, great characters, dastardly villains and a wonderful love triangle [more of a love pentagon really...]. The ending has a bad twist and a truly shocking development and ends bittersweet. All in all, it was worth my time and it should be worth yours."
1,misleading info on the product,"I originally wanted this Escaflowne-The Limited Edition Boxed Set because it came with the bonus product and the special box case. I watched this series before, and my sibling has purchased the same boxed set edition beforehand. It's an awesome series; however, the person who previously owned it, he/she kept the special box case and the bonus item. All I got was the was the DVD series. I was very unhappy. I have purchased a lot items through Amazon before. This seller was the worse I have encountered. It was very misleading to me."
5,A great series that got booted off the air in favor of trash,"I'm not sure what the hell the execs over at Fox were thinking when they pulled Escaflowne in favor of NASCAR Racers. I can guarantee you that garbage didn't generate better ratings. The only thing they did right was make a different opening for the show, which is infinitely cooler than the original Japanese one(which is sadly the one used for the DVD release of Escaflowne). At any rate, there isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said. All I can do is stress that you watch this series, you won't be dissapointed."
5,It's World's Apart,"I have seen this entire series. Escaflowne is a wonderfully beautiful fantasy anime that will amaze. It has mecha action, love, and fantasy packed together to form one great anime. The opening theme song even sounds great. All you anime fans out there know what I mean when I say that the theme song sounds good. Most of the time the anime theme songs are horrible.This anime is a world apart from alot of the other fantasy anime in that it has some pretty memorable characters like Hitomi and Van. Escaflowne is the mecha dragon at the heart of the story. It becomes apart of Van and I mean that literally. The symbol of the dragon heart plays a major role in driving the plot. There are alot more hearts that are healed and broken in this anime.I advise that any anime fan interested in going on an exciting adventure filled with a power packed emotional rollercoaster ride watch Escaflowne.By the way, Fushigi Yugi is another good one to check out."
3,"It starts with a bang, but does it","Escaflowne is a fantasy story with all the soap opera components. The characters and their relationships are very dramatic and it is nice to see the different interactions between the good, bad and in between guys. However as any good anime, death is disregarded easily and characters you learn to love like Vargas and the Raja, die quickly, full of pride, and achieving nothing. I think the back stories are stronger than the real story."
1,Are you kidding me?,"This is the worst foreign language textbook I've ever seen. Definitely I do not recommend it. It doesn't explain grammar almost at all. It never tells you how to say I am, you are, he/she is etc. I wouldn't pay a dollar to the guy who wrote it to teach me Swedish( no offense though). I just want to warn others against buying this book."
1,Horrible book for beginners,"I am a linguist, with Master's degree, and I would like to tell everybody who is interested in Swedish, NOT to buy this book. As a teacher and an avid learner, I must say that this is a very poor manual for the first starters. People who make such tutorials should stay away from linguistics, after all it's a noble and long lived science, developed by many brilliant philologists, and to offer something like that to the public is purely a disgrace to all the rest of us, language learners."
2,CD broke,"The CD was broken in the first book shipped, so could not rip all tracks to my ipod.When Amazon shipped the second book, the new CD was broken too.Fortunately, all tracks could be retrieved from both CDs.."
2,"I wouldn't call it ""Beginner's Swedish""","While this book and 2 CD set is well laid-out and nicely presented, I feel that the title is very misleading. Although no previous knowledge of the Swedish language is assumed, this book is certainly not for the beginner. Even in the first chapter, a huge vocabulary is introduced to the reader. This includes words which I am fairly sure no beginner would particularly need to know, complex grammar properties and basically far too much material. For the complete beginner like me, it was very overwhelming. I would warn prospective buyers that it would be exceptionally easy to become disheartened with the content of this book."
5,UN DISCO TAN BUENO COMO VERSATIL,"Alevosia muestra a Aute como un cantautor maduro, sensible y alevoso al escribir temas de amor, además de lo versatil en la temática encontramos influencias exquisitas latinas ya mostradas en obras anteriores. Quizá el mejor albúm de los noventas del autor."
5,Perfeccion,"Sin lugar a dudas el mejor disco de Aute. No solo tiene la fabulosa colaboración de Silvio Rodriguez, Alevosía de principio a fin es una cadena de temas sensuales (o eroticos?) profundos y bellos. La voz de Aute es impresionante en este disco. Alevosía es un disco perfecto, que no solo remarca a Aute como excelente cantautor, sino tambien como excelente interprete y músico."
5,A SERIOUS ASSET TO ANY CHRISTIAN'S LIBRARY,"These books, (PLEASE KNOW THAT THIS BOOK IS PART OF A 3 VOLUME SET!), are an invaluable resource for any student of Christianity. There is no commentary or editorials- simply verbatim excerpts of the Early Father's writings. What is especially helpful is the Doctrinal Index in the back which addresses every conceivable question about Church Doctrine; and establishes a sound basis for Church Doctrine based on the Early Father's writings and Sacred Scripture.Anyone who wants to know how Christianity was REALLY intended to be through the direction of Jesus, the Sacred Scripture, and Sacred Tradition, should read all 3 of these books. IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH, THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED, READ THESE BOOKS! PLEASE!This set belongs in every Christian's library.The 3 volumes are sold separately, and will run around [price] for all three.Pax Domini sit semper vobiscum,(The peace of the Lord be always with you)."
5,Awesome book!,"Hi. I am an 11 year old from California and a great fan of Magic. Apocalypse is a great book with an interesting plot and recognizable characters from the Magic universe. In this book you follow the battles of the skyship Weatherlight with its crew (Sisay, Tahngarth, Karn, etc.) and the rebels (Eladamri, Lin Sivvi, and Grizzlegom) as the Dominarian Apocalypse nears.Gerrard and Urza are in Yawgmoth¡s lair and are fighting to the death for survival. In the end a horrible evil dawns upon the rebels and threatens to destroy everything that they have fought for¡This book is a great buy with its twisting plot and sharp imagery. Your eyes will be glued to this book until the end (or maybe longer). I applaud J. Robert King for this dazzling piece of literature.The end is near¡"
5,Barney can take a hike!,Schnappi rocks! A local radio station started playing the Schnappi theme song and my family is hooked. I wish there was a way to get the show.
1,Don't be so proud,"Even poets, poets with reasonable knowledge of film, will know that Boom is a masterpiece of trash.Spare me the ridiculous accusations that Americans are too deluged with tunnel vision to recognize the story of a poet. Boom is a story of self indulgence and self pity, not poetry.While Flanders is a poet, his visit to Sissy does not stem from his love for his craft; It comes from opportunistic and monetary desires. This is most noticeably conveyed in his own gibberish, which, poet or not, is still rather indecipherable.Esoteric ramblings are common in late 60's ""art films,"" films that strained themselves to be about something deeper than they really were. Those of you who recognize Boom as a piece of auteur camp are on the right track. Those who are defensive of its ""serious"" elements and in denial of its utterly comedic deprecation need to watch the film again and take notes.This is no poet's delight."
1,Bad Cinema With Liz and Dick,"Except for ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" and ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" the cinematic collaborations between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton never caught fire. ""Boom!"" (1968) remains the worst of the lot. Liz and Dick strike a pose in this pretentiously boring adaptation of a failed Tennessee Williams play, ""The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore."" Burton's film career survived these lapses in judgment, but Taylor's never recovered. A good supporting cast is buried in the wreckage."
4,Good CCIE prep guide,"CCIE: Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert Study Guide, Second Edition is a really good CCIE prep guide.But don't rely on it alone. you really need to study from multiple sources if you want to pass the CCIE."
1,A Wonderful life,I was having a wonderful life until I read this book. Who is this knucklehead? Did he work for Quatitude? Jesus H Christ.
3,Could be better,"I wanted a tool to review this topics I forgot since I passed my Lab such as DLSW, Bridging, Token Ring, MultiCast, WAN... I failed on a first passed 69% instead of 70%! and then got it on the second pass 3 days later and one day before the end of my certif validation with 76%.In this book the topics are fairly well covered and offered a good synthesis. However the review questions are too light not of the level of the exam which also include some simple questions (but coverage is so large !).For someone preparing the lab exam as well, I would recommend to use on the Cisco Web site: 1) the Configuration guides and 2) the ""Overview"", ""Implementation and Configuration"" and ""Verification and Troubleshooting"" pages that you access with www.cisco.com -> Technical Support -> Technology support -> Topic of your choice (e.g. IP Multicast). They are really good and covered usual and sophisticated config and known problems and solutions.CCIE # 9285"
2,Definitely for Dummies!,"Based on other customer reviews, I expected to see some real content in this book. Very disappointed to find an extremely sketchy outline of possible considerations for performance mods. Not really any details at all on any of the subjects offered.If you are truly a car mod ""dummy"" then perhaps this book is for you, to give you some very basic information on avenues you can pursue to upgrade your car. Otherwise, if you are seeking anything in the way of real technical details on how to proceed with upgrades, you'll be sorely disappointed!"
4,A warning against over doing it,"If you are thinking about modifying your car and have the ""need for speed"", read this book first. It'll give you fair warning about what happens legally and financially if you don't plan your modification properly. Bascially before you install that race-ready ECU, turbo or exhaust think of the repercussions it'll cause legally with the environment and the police. The information is very basic but useful to know and far ranging."
5,Good investment!!,If you are looking to drop a couple G's into your car then you would do well to buy this book for its meager $15 price. Heck you can't even buy a steak dinner for less than $15 bucks nowdays and this book is way more filling at 300+ pages of solid info. If you think you already know it all you might be surprised!
2,"È a promocional compact disc, that is, unsalable.","The compact disc is in good condition however, it is a promocional compact disc. It is stamped in its label ""Promocional"". This is illegal and I did not like to have seen.Dirceu"
2,This album is not one of their best pieces of work.,"After listening to this album, I am slightly disappointed. From listening their old releases, its as though Capercaillie wants to drift away from its Scottish roots and become a trendy dance/hip-hop band. Now don't get me wrong, that's fine for those who are into dance/hip-hop music. Although, for the rest of us that are into modern celtic music, its not. I don't believe that mixing one type of music with another is called evolving. It's called changing the very definition of the type of music you are playing. And that's how you lose your devoted fans."
4,pricey but I found a cheaper alternative,"Well If you are like me, I am on a budget at this point in my life. So much so that I am literally saving the change I find to buy my next monitor. Well I have not acheived my goal but am half way there right now. Well like many others I have also scoured the net for the cheapest price to this wonderful monitor. You wonder why I gave it a 4 without even buying it, well I own 3 Sony monitors(2 TV and other) and they are all flat CRT, plus I have never in my 27 years of existence ran into a problem with any Sony monitor. They are a very functional company with the end use in mind. Anyway back to the price story. After scouring the web, I ran across a sight that you can get it for around $585 with free shipping. That's right F>R>E>E> shipping, but it is ground only though, I am sure that you can upgrade to some other type. Anyway the sight is newegg dot com. Hope this helps....."
4,Good Reference,"I bought this as a reference to use at work. It does fulfill that purpose. This book does assume that the reader has some basic knowledge of the topics. Even so, there are certain areas in the book that should have used a different approach, or more detailed explanations in the calculations."
4,Field Guide to the Birds of the Middle East,"I would actually rate this book at a 4.99. The reason I did not give it a 5 is that the maps only show the breeding or summer range. Other than that the book is outstanding. The colors vivid and the artwork is exceptional. The plates have brief descriptions that you need in the field and in the back of the book the author goes into greater depth and gets really specific, this format is different than any other guide I have and I liked it. When and if it ever comes out in soft cover it should be the book to carry when visiting the Middle East.Do not get caught without this field guide when traveling in this area, it is a must to have! The price is just right."
3,birding,"The book has quite some positives but on an initial look it may not be as user friendly as other books I have encountered. One problem is you cannot tell the size of the bird based on the descriptions at the photo page. Again shuffling between the plates and the ""story"" of the birds has not beeen my forte.I stay in Bahrain so the dots are not so easy to trace. It would have been good if a caption was added summarising the countries where the birds are found. Normally if more than five countries are in the map it becomes quite a handful."
2,Poorly organized,"This book is NOT like the Birds of Europe (Princeton Guide). Many illustrations are crowded on pages with very little written information on the same pages. It is all stuck in the back, keyed to the plate number of the illustration.Range maps are only breeding ranges.This book may be the current best of the group in English for this region but it is far inferior in design to the Sibley's or the Princeton Europe effort.Very difficult flipping back and forth to find field marks or behavior information. The information except winter and migration ranges is very good, however it is not accessible as a field guide."
2,not user friendly,"I found this book to be a big disappointment, especially after reaching my destination, of Israel, and having the guide point out all the errors in the drawing and color of the plates. I also did NOT like, the color plates in one section of the book and the main information in the very back. Also NO INFORMATION on wintering habitat. Bird drawings seemed disproportionate with the actual size of the bird. You had to look up the size of each bird in the back of the book. Plus the birds weren't always in the order that they should be, Falcons were not with the raptors.It is barely an acceptable secondary book for the field, but should NOT be the first or only book. It should be used only as a quick reference to what might be there, but then still only in breeding. I would never have purchased this book, had I known."
2,Save your money,"Have not been very impressed with this book. Truely not as it has been described. I have birds around our house that are not in there - with so many and so common, you would expect them to be."
4,Good,"I've actually used these quite a bit since purchasing them. They work fine for what I do. I get the feeling though, that if I really applied some serious force they may not hold up.For casual use- they are just fine. If you really need serious wrenches- I don't know.... buy Snap On."
2,"Very disappointed, a dull and slow moving book","I loved the Cadfael novels and other works by this author so I bought this one. I was greatly disappointed. It is dry, dull and not at all thrilling. It plods along and she telegraphed the ending. ZZZZZ."
2,Forgettable,A little on the slow and dry side. A short novel that doesn't really allow one to get to know or like any of the characters. In short a rather unremarkable book.
1,Disappointing...,"I generally like Michelle Reid's works; however,I was greatly disppointed with this book. I didn't see much chemistry with the two characters. The hero is still bitter with his divorce and the situation that led to it. The heroine has to suffer because of it. Not one of her best."
4,Nice Story..but not one of her best!,"Michelle Reid always writes a good story. However this one was a little boring. Claire has custody of her baby sister, who is also Andrea Markopoulou's neice. He marries her so that his grandmother will have her great grandchild. Nice reading but not up to her usual standards."
3,headless....,"This costume was a great choice... My son loved the idea and has wanted a headless horseman costume all year. I was tentative about the costume ensemble but purchased it anyways. It was a deal $29 dollars, my son was happy. It was constantly greeted by onlookers marveling at the costume and greetings by parents commenting on it being the best costume of halloween night. It was pretty unique in our area. I would buy it again."
5,lots of fun,the five grand kids love these toys and the variety of combinations lots of fun great colors makes them laugh
5,A brilliant book that analyzes US cultural denial about sexual abuse of children and state-sponsored torture,"Schwartz's book is a gift for clinicians, most of whom were never adequately trained to work with patients who have complex dissociative disorders. If you're a therapist, and you haven't read this book, then you are missing out on critical theory about how to work fearlessly and respectfully with these patients who have suffered severe harms as children.I also think the book should be read as cultural commentary. Schwartz discusses the complicity of groups such as the False Memory Syndrome Association in the sexual abuse of children.Dialogues with Forgotten Voices also has carefully documented evidence regarding ritual abuse - where highly organized groups of pedophiles and their lawyers and doctors make a religion out of torturing children.This book has been on the shelf closest to my computer ever since it came out, and I refer to it constantly. A must-read."
5,Among the greatest jazz or movie soundtracks ever.,I've waited over 15 years for this album to come out on CD. Last Tango was my first introduction to Gato Barieri in the 70's. This CD is one of Gato's best and possibly his only orchestral arrangement.The haunting title theme is well set in tango as well as in a jazz waltz tempo. Return tango is awesome.Over 20 soundclips from the film score are added to the CD.
5,Love it,PRO: COLOR!! Vivid/bright. Resolutions and refresh rates are top notch. Very easy on the eyes.CONS: Price ...I spent countless hours researching monitors before buying this. I can't tell you how happy I am!! I use it for heavy 3d gaming and fairly intensive graphics work.If you can afford it BUY IT. You won't be disappointed.
1,not for the social,"If you are looking for a book that offers a good guide to restaurants, bars, and the ""amsterdam"" nightlife this book is NOT for you. Even the daytime activities section in this was severely lacking detail (like renting bikes or picnicing in the park). In fairness to the book, it does offer a great deal of detail about the architecture and museums of amsterdam. So if that is all you are looking for then you will not be let down as I was..."
4,Amsterdam travel guide,"This is my 3rd or 4th Eyewitness guide that I have purchased. They give you a lot of info in a compact book. It includes not only points of interest but also provides the ""must see"". Each guide also includes maps, mass transit, translation of phrases, restaurant, hotel, and general tips to make your trip more enjoyable and safer."
2,Ok I guess,"Although Eyewitness Travel Guides may offer more visual guidance than other guide books, they are still quite terrible. Maps are difficult to read and information is inconsistent."
5,Amsterdam (Eyewitness Travel Guides) PERFECT!,"We are now using the Eyewitness Travel Guides exclusively. We no longer need info about hotels, restaurants, etc., as we log on to Fodor's Travel to get the latest inside info from the Talk site. What we are looking for in a travel guide is inspiration, history and a sense of the country/city we will be visiting--we get all of that from Eyewitness Travel. We are now finishing the plans for our spring trip to Europe. The Amsterdam guide provides just what we need--lovely pictures to inspire us; practical info for visiting the city; history of the city to bring it to life. All this makes this guide just perfect for us."
3,Be Cautious,"Eyewitness does deliver according to their hype, i.e., ""We show you what others tell you about"" The problem is that all they do is show you. If you are interested in detail, especially when choosing what to see (and we all have this problem when traveling). Then Eyewitness may not be the best choice. Without a doubt the photos are great. Just be cautious."
4,Best guide out there for this great city,By far the best guide out there to visit Amsterdam. I've been a fan of eye witness for several years now (used them a lot also) and never found something wrong. Being honest updates to information are not a big deal with european cities but they are always a nice to have.Includes a nice map and easy to follow instructions to get to a lot of different options. I'm giving 4 stars because there's always room for improvement and I feel that the historical part can be improved a little.Recommended for first time visitors and also for someone who wants to have a closer look into this impressive city.
4,Big Bright Book,"This is a lovely book, bright colors and engaging photos. It is good for kids from pre-school through 2nd grade, although I wouldn't buy it for a second grader. (Too easy.) It provides lots of opportunities to count and that is good."
5,Completely Satisfied,These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have worn in sometime. I had forgotten what a Rockport shoe felt like. Just wish they had a pair in black also. Would definately buy another pair if I needed them!
3,Nice but costly,"I bought 4 of these hoping it would make my sanding project a little easier. Well it did but not really sure what the sponge side is supposed to do, it would not wipe up the dust left on the wall from the sanding. Afterwards I saw a better and less expensive option at Lowe's (2 sponges-double sided with sandpaper- for $5)."
3,Gives more insight into popular indicators.,"Talks a great deal about the ""KST System"". Could not find any material showing how to calculate it. However the book includes detailed calculations for Stochastics, MACD, ROI etc.etc all of which is readily available without this book. All I could find was a table which the book keeps referring to as the ""KST FORMULA"", and can in no way help creating this indicator!!!"
3,Heavy Explanation of Oscillators,"If you want an elpanation of how various oscillators are calculated and applied this is a good resource for active traders. The book contains some solid explanations of how to interpret divergences between an underlying security and oscillators. Additionally, several good points made for traders and investors.Why three stars? Mr Pring's book was a very heavy dry read. There was very little comment on how he might have approaced these trades, or if he took them at all. There was a lot of reference to other people's work. Which is fine, but I look for two things in an investment book. The first is ideas that can help me be a better investor/trader, but the second is enjoyment.Something like The Visual Investor (John Murphy) is just much more practical for all but die hard TA students."
2,one of the best books on momentum,"Out dated but I do recommend reading the newer version of this book, it will help you a lot in your technical analysis career. There weren't any new copies ( or a newer version at the the time i ordered this one) I had to order a used one after hearing about it from a friend."
2,More mathematics should be included in this book!,This books is a bit too preliminary and lacks the mathematics that I want.
5,trixie belden and the mystery of the queens necklace,trixie and honey are at it again having fun but being serious as well i enjoyed reading this book. Y ou will too.
4,"Great Side by Side, but...","I got this a couple days ago and have sold it:(. I really did love this stroller BUT when I walked my feet hit the middle wheel! My husband has WAY bigger feet than me and he did not have this problem, but I did (he said I must walk funny:). Oh well. It steered so so well and my kids loved it so much. Really, it was awesome. Too bad about the wheel. I can't spend that much on something that would drive me crazy."
3,Not for the Western rider,I was disappointed after receiving this book. My daughter is taking Western riding lessons and most of the book seems to be geared toward the English rider so she couldn't really relate. She could not learn correctly from it. There are a few pages that talk about Western riding but I feel it was written from an English riding perspective. I would not recommend it for the child who will be riding strickly Western.
3,Not bad...but not great either,"Having now read the 2nd book in this ""witches"" series, I'd have to say it is a pretty good. However, the characters are not all that memorable, and ""winning"" seems to be a little bit ""too easy."" All in all, a quick read but not nearly as good as the ""Wizards"" series from Dianne Duane."
5,Exactly what i needed,only annoying thing is that i had to order these as the big box stores did not have them or only had packs that had various sizes and i would end up throwing away most of the package.
1,Does not work with Vista,"Driver problems. Download imposible.Not compatible with Windows Vista. I have downloaded games for windows 95, 98 and XP on my windows vista operating system without any problem in the past. Why is this game different?"
5,Flowed well!,"First time I have read a collabertive work between mother and daughter. Mary Higgins Clark is my favorite author! Collaberting on this novel didn't seem to detract from the story at all. Anything that puts the joyous Christmas season into a story makes it more desirable to read, in my opinion!"
1,A fast read--a slow story,I am about three-fourths through this book now and am wondering if it will ever end. I have read other Mary Higgins Clark books and have loved them. This one is just dragging.
2,Ho Hum...,"I was disappointed in this book. MHC is my favorite author and I was excited to read a holiday book from her. While reading it, I often found my mind wandering and just simply lost interest in the story. May be next year's story will be better."
1,Dreck,"Let me start by saying that I'm a great fan of Mary Higgins Clark!Yet, I find her collaborative efforts are usually not as well-written as her solo work. This book is no exception. It was truly horrible. I tried to finish the book, thinking it would get better; but it just got worse and I didn't finish it.I'm hoping the next (solo) one will be better! I will skip the collaborative books from now on."
1,The Worst MHC book I've read,My title says it all...don't waste your time with this book. I am a fan of Mary Higgins Clark but this one is so bad it's not worth the time it took to read it. Only redeeming factor is it's a short book.
3,A Ho-Hum Holiday Read!,"I found this one in a stack of books I'd forgotten about. I chose it as one of my holiday reads this year, and am feeling a little disappointed after having read it. The premise of the story, diamonds hidden in a tree that is selected for the Rockefeller Center Tree in New York, appealed to me greatly. However, there were flaws in the story, as this eighty foot tree was stolen by only three, thats right, three men (a little unbelievable). Not much of a Christmas story either other than it takes place in the winter during the holiday season. MHC and CHC, you've have done better."
3,Good Cure for Sleeplessness,"Someone is out to steal the spruce tree bound for Rockefeller Center, which has a catch of diamonds hidden in the boughs. Crooks, stumble bums, fraud victims, and sleuths find merry mayhem in the written for the season Christmas mystery.Not up to vintage Clark standards, which is a shame because it was a good plot that lack development.Writing as a Small BusinessTravelers"
2,Should be listed under Young Adult Fiction,"I'm glad that I only checked this out from the library. Her stories have really seemed to lack substance recently and this is no exception. No suspense in this one. From reading the book jacket, most of her fans could have wrote this for her. These recent books are so watered down recently, they don't qualify to even be in the adult section of the store. Boring!"
1,"No one should give this one a chance, young or old alike.","When I was in my early 20's I read a lot of Mary Higgins Clark. I enjoyed them. As time went on I drifted from her work. Now in my 40s I decide to go back to my early days and try another book by her. A revisit to my youth, I suppose. Why not, it sounded like a good festive read. I WAS WRONG. What age was this intended for? The writing is atrocious; plot, unbelievable; characters, stale.By the way, I listened to the audiobook which was read by the co-author, Carol. She really doesn't have the voice for it. Plot and writing was hard enough to sustain my attention but the voice was really making me take the headphones out.Maybe my taste has evolved as I've aged but certainly no one should give this one a chance, young or old alike."
3,Quick read but nothing too impressive...,"If you haven't read the previous holiday stories by these authors then you won't be disappointed with this read.....but if you have read them (like I have) then you will probably discover that this book is not as good as the ones that have come before it. Filled with the same characters we have grown to know and love, another adventure develops that combines mystery with holiday cheer.Several other reviewers have done a great job of summarizing the plot so I won't waste my time, but I will say that it's a quick holiday read that will put you in a cheery mood no matter what time of year. I was happy to spend my spare time with it but recommend that you check it out of the library instead of spending the money to purchase it.Like others have already mentioned, I too hope that the next holiday story is back up to five-star standards!"
2,Boring...,Thought we might have something in the first 2 chapters but then it became predictable and boring.....
5,deal or no deal!!!,"I LOVE THIS GAME THE SOUND THE EVRYTHING!!! THIS IS A GREAT GAME FOR AGES 1-100.... MY DAD LOVES THIS GAMES TO. AND HES 46 YEARS OLD. SO GREAT FOR ALL AGES... I HAVE GAVE EVEN WE PLAYED THE LUCKY CASE GAME, ITS AT THE END OF THE SHOW AND WE WON IS...(10,000$) WITH THE D.V.D GAME AND THE SOFTWEARE.... SO THIS GAME GETS 100,000,000,000 STARS!!!!!!!"
2,Good Game if you like the show!,"Got this game for my 13 yer old and it was fun the first couple of times we played....think it has hit the ""bottom of the pile"" status pretty quickly. It was fun while it lasted."
3,Fantastic,"If you like the Tv show, you will enjoy this game. It has an interactive Howie Mandel that will talk to you as if you was on the show. I highly recommend this game"
1,grapics,i found deal or no deal to be lacking in grapics. grapics was slow and cd stuckor skipped and my computer is fine. dont buy
1,Can not open,I can not open this on either one of my computers and I am still waiting for tech support to call me back
1,Screens not as pictured and poor product support,The screens are not as pictured. We were unable to see cases being opened or our case at the end - this appeared to be a defect so we exchanged with Amazon (who has GREAT customer service). I had already sent an e-mail to the technical support site listed in the literature and got NO response whatsoever. The replaced software had the same problem. This time I e-mailed CatDaddy games through a link provided on the game itself and again got NO response whatsoever. So now this is being returned for credit.
4,Deal or No Deal,Thought it was fun...i've played the computer game and the tv game...they both have their pro's and con's...i like the computer game because you see all the numbers and what you've knocked out...i like the tv one because it's more real life...then the comptuer game which is virtual...still a great game...
2,Difficult to Use,"I read a review of this software in a digital photography magazine, so was excited to purchase it. While I am sure it is a good piece of software for the advanced user, I find it fairly difficult to use. I expected it to be a whole lot easier than Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, but found that not to be so. Both require a lot of study, and I needed to purchase another ""how-to"" book to get a grip on the features. While I'm sure I will use some of the features, it's not the ""one"" digital editing program that I sought."
5,Nikon Has Done It For RAW Pictures,"The primary advantage of Nikon's Capture NX is it allows you to handle RAW pictures out of the camera; where as a lot of software does not 'see' RAW data. The program allows you to do some 'basic' editing to the RAW pictures that other software does not do. It also handles pictures taken in JPEG. And if you wish, you can even print from the program as well. One of my greatest pictures 13 x 19 was taken and printed in the RAW mode, with incredible quality. Capture NX allows you to export the pictures into various Adobe Photoshop programs for final editing."
4,Works well for editing,"Works very well for photo editing. I grew up in a darkroom and I find Capture much easier than Photoshop to understand. If you need to post process images to do color corrections, dodge & burn, and other manulipations that don't involve altering your composition Capture is a great too.On the minus side, sorting and browsing lots of images is a pain. The tools in Capture are not very helpful."
1,"Don't buy this software for ""Fisheye"" 10.5mm feature","I bought this software for one reason, and one reason only: To convert some photos I already shot with the 10.5 mm Nikon Fisheye lens to rectilinear.It says it has this feature. It doesn't.It won't convert images not saved as "".NEF"" (raw images). It tells you that the pictures weren't shot with a ""Compatible Lens"".I don't always shoot raw. I bought this software just to convert a batch of photos I already shot, and it won't let me. What's worse, is I can't return it or get my money back.If you want this software to convert Fisheye-to-Rectilinear, there may be better choices. For all other things this software does, get Adobe ""Lightroom"". Nikon Capture NX looks like a cheap toy compared to Adobe Lightroom."
5,Works Great,Originally the program was a little slow on my AMD Athlon 64 3200 with 1GB ram. After I applied all of the updates as well as the new version 1.1 update the program is at least 250% faster than prior to the updates. This program is right up there with Photoshop when it comes to photo editing.
4,Great for quick fixes,"Capture NX with the new U Point technology makes it easy to correct the most common errors with raw format (NEF) pictures. All the standard adjustments are there including exposure, white balance, color balance, noise reduction, and sharpening plus cropping, straightening, brightness and contrast. What sets it apart in my opinion is the U Point technology, where you can make adjustments to small (or large) portions of the picture without affecting the entire photo.Whether it is to brighten a face that is a little dark or make the sky bluer, it is easy to do with Capture NX. If you are looking for a product to edit a picture, such as removing pimples, wrinkles or any major modification, this is not the program for you."
2,NX - User Interface Problems,"NX does work and does have some new features which I do like. Several things that I do not like: User Interface is not user friendly - windows are small and con not be re-sized, NX is slower in performance compare to prior release. The niceaties that made the older release very friendly are gone. It appears NX was written to avoid looking anything like the older version. NX does not follow stand windows application standards such as being able to re-size windows. NX does not show that it is 'clocking' when it perform background work - task shows 'no-response' when in reality it is really doing work but the user is not told.This is the first release of the product - hopefully future releases will include user enhancements and become a better rpoduct."
1,Too slow,"I downloaded the trial version of this software and it worked somewhat slowly but o.k. with 5 mp Nikon 5700 raw (nef) files. Unfortunatly once I tried to work with Nikon D80 nef files, the program ran so slow on my computer it was no longer useable. My computer: HP a520n, AMD Athlon 3200+ (2.2Ghz), 512 MB PC2700 DDR SDRAM memory, 160 GB 7200 rpm Ultra DMA hard drive. Not the latest and hottest machine I admit but also not the worst one. I assume this program needs at least 1 GB RAM to run at an somewhat acceptable speed.From what I can tell working with smaller files this program is not bad at all, however as a raw converter it is simply too slow for most computers. Why can Nikon not simply provide a $50 Photoshop NEF plug in? Why don't they focus only on cameras and lenses, the stuff they know?"
2,Nikon Capture NX,"i'm disappointed that i just ordered and installed this software only to find out that capture nx2 will be released at the end of june. it is more compliant with intel based macs. of course wait to purchase if you're using a newer mac. i imagine i didn't do good research at the time, but am also wondering why amazon didn't have the information - other sites did."
3,Not yet ready for Leopard,"The software is powerful and can render NEF's like no other. However it isn't ready for Leopard.Upon opening the software, a message suggesting a software update is needed, keeps popping up. When you attempt to upgrade, the update hangs and cancels itself.Macbook 2.2 Intel Core 2 Duo4GB Ram320GB 5400 HDMac OS X 10.5.3"
4,Good news.......no layers,"The good news about Nikon Capture NX is you don't have to deal with how to do layers! What you do get is several global editing tools and several selective localized area editing tools which all are quite easy to learn. The only thing I miss is the ""clone stamp"" tool."
3,Nikon Capture NX - Lots of Power but a Whole New Interface,"This is a very powerful tool for processing digital images, however the new GUI requires a whole new learning experience before someone comes up to speed on it's use"
4,Nikon Capture NX,"Really like the U Point Technology, lots of nice features. Seems to be more pixel oriented in sizing of photos & Crop tool is hard to get a specific inch size. I will use Capture for my RAW work, then Photo ShopCS3"
2,Not funny to me,everybody has their own taste I just saw it advertised didnt know anything about them just decide to get it but sure wouldnt but any more
3,Maybe not for everyone...,"I purchased this book because of the high ratings given by Amazon reviewers. What I found when the book arrived was 256 pages that could easily have been put into 50 pages or less. There are many pages with a sentence or two in the middle of the page. The author states that the words are so powerful that they need that whole page. I think it was to extend a short manuscript to an appealing length. There doesn't really seem to be a theme, other than the author says he has had religious experiences and what he has learned is in the book. I would have liked to have known what the religious experiences were. I perceived the book as a collection of awakened-sounding phrases and attempted parables that didn't seem to go anywhere. The other Amazon reader reviews on this book are much clearer and more interesting than the book itself."
5,"If you can still find this album, BUY IT!","This is an incredible album, especially for the time period it was released.I don't agree with some of the other reviews on them sounding like Tricky or portishead, because I feel this group has a very unique flow to them, actually one that I was pleasantly surprised by..If I did have to compare them to anything, or anyone, I would say, mix up Mandalay with Telepopmusik and then you'd be close.all in all, the female vocals in this album are how I love them, dark smokey and raspy..the beats are definitley more of a down beat with a trip hop flare..the albume is awesome!"
2,disappointing,"Ok, this is definitely trip-hop. But unlike I have read earlier, it is nothing like Tricky, Portishead or Massive Attack. If you like the music of the above mentioned bands, spare your money and buy their cds. Certainly not Dum Dum baby.This album is plain, tasteless boring material"
5,Bright light.,I've had several head lamps. The Black Diamond Zenix with its hyperbright LED is the whitest and brightest.
4,Brain candy,"I am enjoying this book in bits and pieces. If you don't have time for full committment to a novel, this book is easy to read a bit, think about a bit, and go back to later.And, I have the next two books waiting in the wings for when I finish this one. Plus, I get a new batch via e-mail each week."
2,A surfeit of chiasms,"It is, as advertized, a book of word play. Some are quite humerous and others clever and ingenious. However the chiastic style begins to wear after awhile. Ruth Smith"
5,Bright Enough,I used this during Sandy to walk from my house to check on the apple coolers. No batteries & easy enough to crank. Always ready to go. The 2 settings of brightness is also useful.
3,"Good, but can't be pushed too hard","Ok. It's my fault. But these manufactures never tell you JUST how much you can safetly wind a crank device. So, I ""pushed"" this lantern a little too much (maybe 10-15 minutes of intermittent cranking), and I 'blew' the circuity."
5,the lil lantern that could,I purchased this lantern as a result of the reviews here and wanting something that I didnt have to be concerned about batteries or for fuel.(Just something else to have to lug around)I received it yesterday and cranked it for about a minuted and half and have watched it for three hours now and it still glows great. I have it on two bulbs on opposed to four. Going into this thinking I would get so-so results has changed quickly!
4,Crank light,The lantern is very small and will cast just enough light for you to see what you are doing and may help you find something in the dark as long as you have a idea where the item is. Overall a well made lantern and will be a good addition to my camping/survival supplies.
2,Great idea but broke quickly.,"My wife and I are avid campers. We were excited to find this little eco friendly, hand-cranked lantern. It worked great for one night, but the second night we tried to use it, there was only a very faint glow for a few seconds, then nothing. We were careful with it, but maybe we wound it too much or maybe we bought a defective one.Definitely a great idea, but broke very easily."
3,Decent product,"I have found this wind up light sufficent for providing light to stumble your way around in a dark enviroment but don't expect to do task using this light. It's sphere of light is limited in range and only bright enough for the most basic of necessities. Definately not a camp light, just a personal light."
1,doesn't produce enough light,"I bought this lantern for a cave exploring trip to Peru. Unfortunately while on the bus to the cave all my gear was stolen except a small back pack, in which I had the Wind 'N Go Mini LED Lantern. I still went into the cave, which was a big mistake. First of all, this thing doesn't produce enough light to see 2 feet in front of you, then it broke on me so I was stuck a mile inside a cave in the darkness. Luckily I had a pack of matches, so I lit my clothes on fire and got out after 5 hours by using flamable bat grease on a stick to make a torch. I also had the misfortune of crawling on bat guano and maggots.Stick with batteries and electric eels."
4,Improving on Favorites,"This book provides some good techniques for reducing fat in cooking without sacrificing flavor. My family especially likes the versions of Rogan Josh, Moussaka, and Spaghetti Carbonara. The techniques, such as lower fat ways to thicken, or lower fat ways to handle eggplant, are great, and easy to apply to other dishes. Full nutritional info is given, both for the ""classic"" versions of the dish, and the ""Minimax"" recipes, so that those trying to follow a careful eating plan can do so."
3,Got the job done!,"I was given a vacuum and had the hardest time finding vacuum bags at a decent price, 8 bags for this price is too good to pass up and it gets the job done!"
5,Good Quality,I've used this product for several years now and it always has performed reliably;bags last well and do not tear.
4,They work,"They work as well as vacuum bags do. They collect trash, filter out dust and do whatever else is needed."
1,Wrong bags listed with kenmore vacuum,"I needed vacuum bags so I pulled up the vacuum cleaner on amazon and the page listed the bags as ""people who bought this also liked"". Why people would also like these bags is beyond me."
5,Great price,I am very happy with the price. I looked in the stores and you can only purchase them online and they are almost twice the price.
5,vacuum bags,I couldn't find these replacement bags in any store and was happy to be able to buy them in large packs. They work well.
2,AMD K6/2 User,"The price is right and the system is easy to use, but when I scanned a photo, the result was only fair. That was just the beginning of my problems, however. When I went on to other non-scanner activities, over a few hours my PC became progressively slower until it froze altogether.Only with great difficulty was I able to restart the system. I backed out the software and my system function returned to normal. I upgraded my memory from 32 MB to 160 MB and reloaded, after having had a technician check my PC for any other problem. After reloading the scanner software I had the same problems. I have a 400MHz AMD K6/2 and must conclude that this scanner does not work on this system. In fairness to the manufacturer, the system requirements called for a Pentium based processor, which I had interpreted as including anything comparable."
3,Changed my mind,"Since I wrote the review that was somewhat harsh on this scanner, I went back to Mustek's site in the hopes that they'd come up with something to make this work in XP before I broke down and bought a new scanner (I hate to admit defeat). While there are still no specific XP drivers for this scanner, they do have a tool available that's supposed to make the Win.2000 drivers work. .....While the site wouldn't let me download the app. that's supposed to do the trick, there were instructions for editing your registry in order to make the 2000 drivers run, and guess what, it works! The scanner now scans in better color than it ever did using ME or 98! While it still sounds like it's about to explode every time I turn it on, it's definately a deal at under [amt]. if you're comfortable tweaking your registry a bit. With that in mind, it now qualifies as five stars"
3,for the money there's better,"I bought one of these when they first came out. The scans aren't too bad if you realy play with the settings (the bundled software's not too bad either).On the serious problem side, the drivers cause problems with certain peripherals when using Win 98, upgrading to ME fixed that, and things were pretty stable. Also be aware, there's no XP support for this scanner, and from what I have been able to learn from talking to Mustek's nearly non existant support staff, they have no intention of releasing updated drivers for this scanner that will run with XP"
4,Taut & suspenseful thriller,"Chris Judge is an undercover cop on the edge who has lost everything. Suffering from burnout, he is contemplating taking his life. Ashley Marin survived a kidnapping several years earlier, and was rescued after three harrowing months by a less jaded and much younger Chris.Now Ashley's daughter is missing, and since she is not sure who she can trust, the only person she can turn to is Chris. She is convinced that the same culprits that kidnapped her are behind Lauren's disappearance. When he reluctantly returns to Colorado to assist in solving the kidnapping, Chris finds a new purpose and a new possible love, as he and Ashley join forces with the clock ticking to locate Lauren and bring her home.This is a taut and suspenseful story with a couple so damaged by the past that it will take a miracle for them to find Lauren and heal their own wounds. Erickson keeps the story tight and the tension in overdrive, resulting in a satisfying conclusion."
5,Barry swan-song an opera,"Barry's done a number of good scores for the James Bond movies. He's also done some that were mediocre to just plain bad. Not so for his last soundtrack for the series, a truly amazing piece of work that bears relistening. The instrumental work for the Pretenders' ""Where Has Everybody Gone?"" is superb, as are the more romantic ""If There Was a Man"" melodies. a-ha's title song is ho-hum but is used to good effect a couple of times. Indeed, it is one of the last Bond soundtracks to utilize instrumentals of the title track. It is one of Barry's best scores, and I'm glad he made this one his last effort. He will be missed."
2,Polished Antique,Ski Resort Extreme finds you in charge of setting up and running a ski resort. Complete with all the anemities needed to make skiing and snowboarding a comfortable pasttime.If you've played previous incarnations of Ski Resort Tycoon or Ski Park Manager there's nothing new to be had here. That's the great weakness of this game. It gives a graphic and audio facelift to those old games: if you're looking for an updated version of those then this will do well. Otherwise you're not missing anything.The game will run fine if your system meets the requirements. The Graphics and Sound were well done and a great improvement over the older versions of this game.The game interface was okay. It's not that intuitive and finding information on what to do or how to do it is sometimes an exercise in itself.
4,perfect headphones for urban dwellers who use mass transit,"I chose these by reading other reviews on Amazon. I am pleased with them and recommend them. Good sound, light weight. The best feature is that they do NOT leak sound yet you can still hear loud noises around you. This is perfect for an ipod-using NYC subway rider. Don't want to annoy others by leaking sound, but you have to be able to hear if there is exterior noise, at least enough to know to turn down the sound and find out what's going on.Only con - Once you lose or wear out the removable spongy pieces I'm not sure where you can get replacements."
2,Poor sound quality,"I was very disappointed in these headphones and returned them. Although they were comfortable, the sound was muffled. No mid or high range and the base was muddy. The buds that came with my 2nd generation Nano are much better."
4,"Comfortable, I recommend...","The earbuds that come with iPod and many MP3 players often are too big to fit in my ears comfortably. These iRhythms fit into the ears like ear plugs and deliver an excellent quality sound without the discomfort of the standard size ear phones. Over and around the head ear phones are often too big for daily use and the standard earbuds are uncomfortable. I give this product 5 stars for, comfort and 4 stars for audio quality."
1,poor sound quality and noise reduction,"While the price may have been a clue, the sound quality has been poor. Sounds muddy and muffled. No seperation or crispness. I tried the different options included in the packaging to get a good fit to reduce exterior noise. Any degree of effectiveness has been from pressing them to an uncomfortable degree into my ear canal. I do not recommend them at any price."
3,Good for a few laughs,"This compilation of Oscar's greatest moments presents all aspects of our nation's most prestigious awards show, from 1971 to 1991. Some of the moments are extremely comical as well as controversial. Chevy Chase, Billy Crystal, and Johnny Carson contribute many humorous clips from their days as leader of the ceremony. Paul Hogan appears as well, delivering the film's funniest speech, directed on ways participants can make the award show more exciting for TV viewers. Clint Eastwood also has a humorous moment when he filled in for a missing Charlton Heston. Although the documentary contains many comical clips, the musical preformances bog down its overall appeal. Never the less, this documentary of America's most watched award show is a decent provider of the show's historical laughs, speeches, glamour, and musical numbers. Don't worry, it's shorter and more entertaining than the annual four hour event."
4,"Is good, maybe not great, but good!","Is very good if you are a huge fan of Oscars moments and the Hollywood people, keeps you very entertained, has a little something from the opening ceremonies and songs nominated as well as actors and best movies, I like the fact that it shows you the actual ceremony of that particular year and not just scenes of the winer film."
4,Book Desert Fury,This book arrived in very good condition as promised by seller.My husband enjoyed reading the book. I will use this vendor againwithout hesitationtoni57
2,OK just ok,"Knife was pretty cheesy, low quality, but, I am a knife snob. The good part is for the price you don't worry about damaging it to much. Great knife if you do not care about quality of handle or blade."
2,"works ok, but too expensive","instead of buying the imac 20"", buy a mac mini, a 20"" monitor from any half-decent manufacturer, and a keyboard/mouse. it will cost less than half as much and work just as well."
2,"Expensive, NOISEY! Poor support!","This iMac is one of the worst apples I've ever used. It's way too over-priced, and what's worse is that my iMac has a noisey buzzing helicopter sound to it and the hard drive click and whirr like crazy. I called Apple and since I custom configured it on the phone with them, I can't return it.I've had many many many many problems with my iMac and I would not recommend it to anybody."
1,Do not buy!,i was very dissapointed when i recieved this set. horrible quality! it had scratches all over and the finish was warped. it's not worth saving the extra money on these. spend a little more and get heavy duty flatware. i've learned my lesson here.
3,Decent for the Price and for the Everyday,"This flatware is attractive. It is, obviously, not high-quality (the price tells you that), but, for my money, it's one of the greatest buys I've made."
4,dinnerware,"These are great everyday and for entertaining.We get alot of compliments. They are more sturdy than traditional silverware. If you are looking for fun everyday use these are great, but if you are looking for a statemant that reflects high class look at the price again. the casting is not as smooth as more expensive brands and is not perfect"
4,?,Nice set but luckily I didn't send this as a gift. Its packaging was horrible. It came in a brown plain box
5,Finally Found the Matching Silverware,"We purchased a set identical to this, several years ago at Macy's. It was under their own store brand. Over the years, we have lost pieces here and there, and thought that we would have to go with something new all together. Then this showed up on Amazon. It is exactly a match. This silverware will perform excellently for you. The lines are clean and contemporary. You'll love it -- we have !!!"
2,Royal Cuisnine Duke stainless Steel Flatware,"This is the second set I have purchase, sister ""borrowed"" the other. My family just loves the set."
4,Fantastic Deal,"I bought this set in a hurry before Thanksgiving because we wouldn't have had a matching set for everyone on the table otherwise. I am very pleased with the quality and look of this silverware set. Not a complaint by any stretch, but I like my flatware to have a little more weight than this set has. This is a great casual set, though."
3,good--but only if on sale,"I was suckerd into buying this set on a Friday only sale. At under 20bux the set is a good deal. So far (3 washings) the set seems to hold up well in the dishwasher---but I know that is not long enough review period. So far I rate the set well, but review period is to short to determine if the silverware is actually worth it. (Although 20bux is nearly free so why get worried on quality, just buy another set)."
5,Work Well,Custom made just for the finger tips. They cover your entire finger tip well and stay on. We have used about 10 bandages so far and they really work well.
3,A mature recording,"Eddie Henderson is a mature musician still playing with much power (and wisdom). He has a beautiful sound. One notices that the band has worked together for a while. Lewis Nash (dr) and Ed Howard (bs) make a brave team. It was a good idea to include vibes (Joe Locke) besides the piano (Kevin Hays). I consider Joe Henderson's *Jinriksha* as the top-selection. Grover Washington Jr. makes a nice appearance. Somehow, however, the CD is simply too beautiful. There is a lack of edges. Moreover, I think that Eddie Henderson should have included a couple of originals."
2,10 YR ????smoke alarm,"I bought 3 of these alarms in 1999. After 4 months all 3 of the alarms gave the low battery warning. So much for the 10yr battery, which actually wasnt replaced until now (july 2001)"
4,IT LASTED 12 YEARS.,We got this alarm in 1996 and the batteries have just now given up. Easy to put up and no electric wiring or changing of batteries to deal with. this is my kind of alarm! - Jeanie Cody
4,Good value ask me again in ten years,"Unfortunately the real value will not be known for ten years. I was so tired of changing batteries every time daylight saving time changed I jumped at the chance to get a ten year alarm. They arrived faster then expected and it looks like a high quality product. Activating the batteries was a snap, literally.now just wait ten years and hope we never hear them until then. I would certainly buy them again."
1,Not really Greek,"Never a problem with Amazon.com. A Greek man who found out I like authentic Greek music told me to buy a soundtrack entitled ""Never on Sunday"". So I bought it. It's pretty stale. Not what I expected at all."
4,I'm suddenly very thirsty for ouzo!,"This is a very light, charming ode to the Greek spirit that comes off as some kind of mix of The Taming of the Shrew and Zorba the Greek. The American character drove me nuts with his intellectual presumptions of telling the Greeks how they ought to be, since the real Greece has somehow failed his high-flung notions. His transformation at the end was very gratifying. Melina Mercouri radiates spontaneaity and joy, it's a shame she didn't experience greater success in English language movies. Now then, pass the ouzo and let's start dancing!"
5,THIS SELLER IS EXCELLANT,"THIS MOVIE IS WONDERFUL,, IF YOU GREW UP IN GREECE IN THE 60S THERE ARE ALOT OF MEMORIES IN THIS MOVIE"
5,Great story.,"I read this book as a teenager, back in the 60's. I re-read it and it is as good as I remember. The idea was probably the precursor or seed for the TV show ""Sliders"". It's a fast read and a great page turner."
2,poor quality and high price !!,"Very heavy and not worth the price, exchanged it with Diamond pro and Wow..."
1,Cheap but very poor quality,"This monitor, well, it sucks. It was a waste of the $600 I spent. The biggest problem is that it's very blurry above 1600x1200 making those modes almost useless (on XP). Attached to my PowerBook it can't handle rates greater than 60Hz above 1600x1200 and it so blurry even at lower resolutions it's unusable.Second major complaint is the display is flat and lifeless. Colors are washed out and contrast is poor. Forget calibrating it for anything, you are lucky to just have it look decent.It's a very poor quality 19"" display in a 70 pound 21"" box. Unless you want a monitor that's big because you have eyesight problems then this isn't the monitor for you.Would I buy one again? Hell no."
3,"okay, but I expected more.","This book is okay, and probably good for someone new to raw foods and having babies and young children. It just doesn't hold my interest for some reason and I don't believe it has a lot of recipes or suggestions."
5,Micky is amazing!,"Micky (Michaela Lynn) was running a vegan daycare in the small town where I live, and all the kids loved her. Even kids who aren't vegetarian and whose parents tought they didn't like vegetables enjoyed the food and starting asking for raw veggie snacks! I couldn't say enough good about Micke and her book. A must for any parent!"
5,Rick Nelson Masters Country,"The beautiful man with the beautiful voice, Rick Nelson, has done it again. This man could sing any style music and make it Award Winning.It's too bad his life was cut short for many reasons. But,for his fans, he could have been a Country Star.The song ""You Just Can't Quit"" written by him, should have and still could be a hit. No matter what kind of songs Rick Nelson sang, they were beautiful, and they all told a story."
4,Great singing. Needed just a bit more.,After reading several of the reviews I ordered this album. I've always thought he was underrated. His last solo album was really good so this one intrigued me.The song selection was very good. His vocals just as good as ever. The instrumentation was what was lacking. IMHO it suffers from being too much Nashville Sound imitating real country sound. Not that I won't listen to it a lot and certain songs a whole lot.Just my opinion. I think anyone that liked him and likes country-rock will probably like this.
5,A Great Effort That Was Short-Lived,"As a teenager I remember when Rick Nelson switched to C/W and how disappointed I was at the time. Of course I was young and didn't have an appreciation for these albums (yes I still bought them, so I guess I qualify as a true fan). Well I am very happy that I purchased this CD. Rick put together his best efforts to date on these songs and could have probably developed a terrific following in this steadily growing music segment at the time. Why did he stop after only 2 albums? One can only guess. But listen to ""You Just Can't Quit"" on the 1966 release and ""Alone"" on the 1967 one (both of which he wrote) and you might get an idea of his personal stuggles at the time. You won't be disappointed."
3,Good...,"... but brief. it's an interesting listen (sounds like a very cut up version of the Firmament albums), but not quite memorable."
4,awesome late 50's ambient lounge,"recorded on an Ampex three track live in the Kaiser Aluminum Dome at Waikiki, this album is part of Lyman's series riffing on the legend and mythology of the Hawaiian pantheon. I actually believe he sort of meant it. I also believe that he had no idea he had recorded the sonic ancestor to Lifeforms by Future Sound of London, and many other ambient/techno/exotica slabs.Unlike the previous reviewer, I find the sound on my original copy of the vinyl to be OUTSTANDING! it is well worth the effort to seek out the original ...have fun."
1,Technically compromised,"This CD seems to have been mastered from a mono source, with what sounds like a mild electronic amibiance added. I have some tracks from this album on a ""Best of... "" Lyman CD in real stereo, so I don't know what happened here. Also, the track listings on both the back cover and inside the booklet...are inaccurate, with tracks out of order and at least one item listed, but not actually on the CD."
2,you better watch out,"What do you get when you have a lame story, an idiotic supporting cast, a killer who is about as scary as the Easter Bunny and your biggest star is Pinky Tuscadero? A movie that Comcast's Fear Net shows for free because no one with their brain screwed on tight would pay to watch it. The entire story was so abysmal because there wasn't any character that could be identified with. Not the killer, not the heroine, no one. The ending included a slight twist. However it would have been a lot better if that annoying old redhead came crashing down with the elevator. If you like horrible '80s slashers that are so implausible that they're laughable then this may be for you."
3,Pretty Good,"First of all, I am a fan of 80s horror film, and so the cheesier the better. This movie is pretty good if you like slasher films, but there is very little blood to be found in this film. The worst part is that you don't get to see the killings at all except for a woman who is asphyxiated with a plastic dope bag. I take that back, the worst is that you want Blaze, the main character the killer is after, to die. She is nothing more than a self centered person who doesn't even acknowledge her son and you kinda hope she gets it in the end.So, overallNot much bloodNot much nudityMain character that you hope will dieWith all of that, it is still not the worst film I have seen."
2,"As noted by others, Dogobie is Not Durable","If your dog likes to chomp and chew, this will not hold up. Will not buy again (for my dog)."
2,ok dog frisbee,"The frisbee is very light weight, and is uncontrollable with moderate wind. My dog doesn't use the frisbee as a chew toy but will gnaw at it alittle when she brings it back. it had puncture holes in it the first day. it's a good back up frisbee if i can't find the the my other. I recommend the Ruff Dawg K9 flyer."
4,best big dog disc,"colors are easy to spot, but on a cold autumn day, even if the dog sees the yellow one, and its your first time throwing it around, so he doesnt know what to do, its gonna be lost. you wont be able to find it in the dry grass or cornfields you just tossed it across.the good thing about it, is the rim makes it for easy throwing even if you never thrown a frisbee or thrown a straight one before. its soft, so if you throw it hard into say, a tree, its not going to break, its flexible, so you can stow one in the back of your jeans on the way to the park.the downside, is that its not for small dogs. they have trouble holding it in their mouths. no good for chihuahua's, but decent for collies, labs, or even malamute sizes.comes in only UCLA colors."
2,Melted in the sun,"My dog enjoyed this frisbee for a couple hours, but we left it outside for an afternoon and it completely warped and was unusable as a frisbee. Still made for a decent chew toy I guess..."
5,Good value,"The Dogobie has lasted longer than any other disc that I've tried with my German Shepherd. It flies great and slow enough that he can run along and catch it from the air. It's been very durable but I don't allow him to get to it when we're not playing. I'm sure he could chew it up, but all of the other discs I've tried have been destroyed in a matter of weeks just from regular play."
2,not that great..,"so.. I'm pretty unimpressed... this disc is hard to throw.. it has to be dead flat or it will slice quickly... I haven't been able to throw it as far as a flippy flopper or flying squirrel yet... of all the toys my dog has played with so far, this is the hardest one for him to pick up.. I'm fairly dissappointed... I didn't buy it on amazon and the company I did buy it from censors their reviews.. so I thought I'd put the word out on an impartial site"
1,Useless,"Well sorry to be negative, but I just purchased this scanner and found it to be almost useless. I have a very modern PC running Windows ME. Despite this the scanner was SLOW, the quality of the images it produced were rubbish, the software managed to crash more often than it worked. Unless you enjoy watching paint dry, give this one a miss. I know it seems like a bargin, but the only thing that impessed me about this product is the fact you don't need a power supply. One star is generous."

5,Durable,"Been using it as my bed for over six (6) months now. No problems, very comfortable. I weigh close to 350 lbs."
2,disgraceful,"this was purchased as a birthday gift for my son- as he is a late September baby, the chair is being used indoors for now. Not quite six months in use and the eleastic cording has all torn away on one side. disgraceful for a product of this cost."
4,I thought it was cool -- but the guys thought it was a gimmick,I bought these items for a couple of male family members after I saw the device on Cool Tools.I thought they would be a safe way to work in tight and dark quarters with a potentially dangerous tool.The guys thought it was a gimmick. I don't know if my brother in law used it. My husband used it and said it was heavy duty and worked well. The added light was appreciated. I think he was being nice.
5,worth the money,the best utility knife I have ever used. Very sharp and stays sharp.I really like the light on the end.It makes working in tight spaces a bit easier.
4,Terrific book,"Bruchac has created a terrific historic novel that has enough action for young male adults and enough history and research to appeal to an adult audience. Bruchac does a wonderful job of giving a sense of the complexities of growing up on a Navajo reservation in the first half of the book. The irony of a nation trying to wipe out the Navajo language but using it as a crucial means of communication during 20th century wars should not be lost on the reader while reading the second half of the book. Bruchac's narrator tells this tale in an even-keeled, even-tempered manner. The reader is allowed to gain his own sense of injustice our nation has inflicted upon its Native American population. Bruchac's description of the progression of America's involvement in World War II's Pacific campaign is well laid-out and dramatically presented. Highly recommended."
5,Short and oh so sweet!,"Although only consisting of 4 songs, so really an EP, this album has puts on display the quality and diversity of The Australian Crawl's music. Reckless: A classic ballard. The Night: A Funk Rock beauty with wrought, grinding guitars and a cool rythym. White Limbo: A funk choon with a throbbing beat. And Looking For Cool: A sad but really groovy sound of minimal amplification with great percussion. For me just these four songs completely capture the sound of the Australian Crawl. A perfect compliment to this classic EP would be 'Crawl File' by the same group. However Semantics is untouchable for just sheer ambience and summer happiness! Buy it! I've yet to hear a better or more complete EP. It is definitely worth the money!"
2,Its just ok,"There is alot of background noise even when I switch channels. It would be ok for a back up phone if needed. I had a different Vtech phone for many years until I had to finally replace it. I should have got the same one. Don't waste your money, get a better grade of phone."
2,Lousy Sound Quality,"I bought this phone 2 weeks ago at wallyworld...it has nice features and is pretty easy to figure out how to set it up, but the sound quality is terrible..sounds very fuzzy ...people i talk to say it sounds real good at their end...but at my end i couldnt make out what they were saying....needless to say...."" back it goes """
2,"Good phone, bad wallmount","I was very happy with the signal clarity, and simplicity of operation. I was very disappointed with the wall mount which leaves the base unit sticking out from the wall at 90 degrees (in the same orientation as the picture). This wall mount will not allow me to mount the phone under my kitchen cabinets. I'm returning this phone to purchase a wall-mount 900mhz unit from a company that understands telephones."
2,Doesn't fit 73 1800ES,"2 stars - not completely as described. Does not fit 73 1800ES, I have tried a metal fan and my original fan is plastic. I have yet to find a fan to mount this clutch.Quality looks ok and I will try if I find a matching fan to mount if it doesn't hit the radiator."
2,candle holders,when i recieved shipping box it was open on the buttom side and the caandleholders were falling out and scratched.
4,Good product,"So far I've only used it on a few videos, however the comments from viewers (unsolicited) were that the music was very professional and fit the action. Only drawback is that it is not easy to alter the music at a precise point. Have to score smaller scenes to do it. However, for the most part after only a few uses (and I expect to get better with it over time) the product performs as I expected and I'm pleased. Web site has good tutorials as well."
2,Music Selections Are Just Plain Awful - Mostly Noise,"I could only find one category that I would consider good -- the rest were annoying to painfully bad. If you want some soft mellow background music, you are mostly out of luck. Oh, you can order some more packages of terrible music on-line. The only one I could stand was the Wedding Package, but I don't see any weddings on the horizon. And they are expensive. Just go to the Sony web site and listen to the sample music and it is representative of what is in this software. Total waste of money. Pinnacle Studio has far better selections, but obviously they don't work with Sony Vegas Pro 8. Otherwise, it works as advertised. I just do not understand whey they didn't offer more variety for other generations of music lovers."
4,A great resource,I found this Bible useful in helping me to establish a regular time of Bible reading and prayer to start my day. The text is broken up into sections that can be easily read in a relatively short amount of time. Each section contains (1) an introduction that generally does a good job of setting the stage for how the passage might be related to modern life and (2) good open ended questions that I found useful in thinking about how to apply the relevant text to my personal situation. There are no answers to the questions so its does require thought and effort on the part of the reader and does not provide canned answers or insights.
4,ClosetMaid Corner Support #1001,"ClosetMaid Corner Support, White enamel painted finish, allows the shelving edge of a ClosetMaid shelf to be supported by the strength of the perpendicularly mounted edge of another shelf. Mounts over a wire rail of one shelf and under the wire rails of the supported shelf."
1,I can't recomend this set,"Maybe I got a couple of defective pieces, I don't know. But I've had this set for only three months and already I have two of the butter knives with rust.I confess, I have left them in the sink for a day or so with other dishes to be done. But my previous set of stainless flatware lasted me 20 years.Beware of this set's mirror finish--once you get a scratch it really shows up. Don't use anything to wash it other than a soft sponge.If you immediately wash your dishes after you finish eating, and if you use a soft sponge, perhaps you won't have a problem. But I cannot understand why the pieces rusted.Also, I don't know how to get a couple of replacement pieces. When I received the set, the set was not in a labeled branded box. Instead, the pieces were wrapped in bubble wrap with no manufacturer info or warranty info.B."
5,10 stars,"Geee-I think I wore the grooves out of the dvd. As a musician,this is one of the best recordings on dvd of one of the tightestbands in music.If you spiced out Ms. Winehouse, the band alonewould be worth the dvd. Her voice, on the other hand, isone of the greatest amalgams of hip hop, dinah washington, and motown.You can hear all the influences, but unlike so many, she comes outwith her own awkward, unusually beautiful style.IMO- Just one of the most soulful, and original femalesingers to come by perhaps since janis joplin.10 stars if was able."
