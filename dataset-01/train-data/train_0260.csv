1,Bait and Switch,"Avoid this one! This CD looks like a great bargain but several of the versions are not the original ones -- and there is no clue about that in the description or on the cover. ""Walk in the Black Forest,"" ""Raunchy"" and others are absolutely awful. Must be the reason it's priced so low."
3,Great instrumental hits of the 50's - 80's,"This album is not bad - you know. OK there is only 10 tracks. But the sound is very good with a very fine remastering. Some of the titles is very old from the vinyl days. It is funny to hear Horst Jankowski with ""A Walk In the Black Forest"". This tune is very much stereo from the early days with two channels. The original LP at the time was issued in Mono and Stereo. Mantovani's arrangemnt of the theme from Exodus is maybe more like the director would like it. He was not happy with Ernest Gold's recording of the opening music, - but that's another story. If you like som instrumental music for relaxing or for a car ride - buy this CD. The price is not to high - enjoy."
3,Not a bad Cd,"I feel ten songs is very thin to spand a 30-40 year period. Walk in the black forest has a nice piano rag tempo. Stranger on the shore is still beautiful played on an alto sax. Many songs such as forever, Ari's theme and soft summer breeze are very nice with a slow mellow tempo. Raunchy is OK but I prefer Duane Eddy's version. Walk on the wild side feels like something played during half time at a football game. The striiper have very seductive feel to it."
3,Not a Bad Little Book,"I bought this book over 25 years ago when I first started weight training, I found it very inspiring and it certainly helped me starting out.The self-defense section is out of date now, but the book is almost 40 years old. I still have it in my collection, and will always treasure it!Thanks Mr.Callum, wherever you are!"
4,"nice cd, somehow unpredictable","this is the first solo kotzen cd i've heard. surprisingly i never thought it'd be done that way. i thought the cd would be filled with guitar solos.he's got a great voice, sounds much like chris cornell, but maybe it's just me. the songs are really good and some are quite radio friendly. the tracks are very diverse. cool cd!"
1,If you like Inner Galatic fusion experience don't buy this,"It's totaly diferent work from other intrumetal oriented Kotzen's work. In this album he sings on all tracks, it was totaly frustrating, not because he singing, he changed his style from previous albuns."
3,Not the best Juno Reactor CD..,"This CD is good, but does not blow you away like the other two CDs in the J.R. arsenal"
4,hard acid trance,"I expected more of a goa trance sound, but this CD delivers a driving acid trance beat that never lets up. Definitely a good pick for technophiles. Could be a soundtrack from an acid trip."
4,Not quite bible of dreams but still very good!,"I do not own this cd, but I do own 'bible of dreams' and i've listened to this recording. I think transmissions is a bit faster than bible of dreams, and doesn't have a jungle twist to it. I think: ""Atom Bomb"", ""Luna-Tic"", and ""High Energy Protons"" are the best songs on the recording. If you like the orb, daft punk, orbital, or any other trance/techno, then transmissions is a great cd for you.Not perfect but very nice."
4,there is no better techno trance out there,"Granted that the other two albums (especially Jouney to the Infinite) are in many ways superior, this one is by no means bad. The tracks 4, 5, and 6 are mediocre and you probably will grow tired of them very fast. This still leaves more than 40 minutes of very good atmospheric dance music. Tracks 2 and 8 are my favorites."
3,For it's time it was good...,"I bought this CD, having known Juno since Bible of Dreams and Shango. Then, after buying Labyrinth, I went to this. What's in the past, should be left in the past. It's a good start for Juno's career, but I'm glad to see them come so far now.If you're expecting more of excellent Juno, think again. These are good trance songs, but they aren't engineered as well here. The engineering quality reminds me of how Orbital first started out and mastered their art over time.The music reminds me alot of CoEx: Synaethesia. It has some odd voice-recordings that sound extremely archaic, but, of course, they fit the songs.They also tried to follow a theme about space, and pull it off somewhat half-heartedly. Another band, Delerium, enjoyed creating themes in their albums, and this is akin to Spheres II.This CD isn't as good as everyone's saying it is. If you're a die-hard Juno fan (like me), you won't miss this album, trust me."
2,Confusing,"I bought this movie with interest, but was sadly very dissapointed.is a storythat in writing sounds very interesting, but in action has so much missing that makes it very difficult to understand. You must stay very focused into it and even so, you'll get like ""What did just happen here?""Low budgets do that to movies."
2,Anyone can be a camera operator!,"One word for the ""professionals"" who shot this footage...Tripod!Yep, its pretty much home movie quality here, but if you want the info and don't mind the shakes...go ahead, make their day and buy one!"
4,"Good, but more for the professional","Pretty good, although recommended only for military professionals or the more advanced military reader; the book is very focused on modern warfare command level issues and so may not appeal to the casual reader."
5,A mechanized Duffer's Drift,"This book is the modern version of ""The Defense of Duffer's Drift."" Inspired by that classic (a series of fictional small unit actions in the Boer War intended as a learning experience for the commanding officer), this book follows the same story line (as freely admitted by the author.) ""The Defense of Hill 781"" substitutes Ft. Irwin NTC for South Africa, OPFOR for the Boers, and a U.S. mechanized task force for the British army. A well done, light read."
5,Perfect solution,"This rack replaced a large tote that collected all our basketballs, volleyballs and soccer balls. This rack looks so much better and the kids actually put them up when they are finished with them, unlike before. Perfect solution."
5,Basketball Ball Rack,It is a great way to organize the basketballs not have them scattered around. Love it!
2,Truly not original,"Graduation night, ex-boyfriend and buddies followed by new girlfriend and her friend catch ex-girlfriend and new geek boyfriend parking. Geek is beat near death ex-girlfriend is raped and then beaten to death with 2x4 so that she won't tell.Ten years later class reunion comes up and then we are taken on a well-known killing tour. Just another cheap revenge movie, no real gore or original killings. The cops are as always clueless and once convinced they are only there to clean up the mess.I give it 2 stars only because some of the acting is ok, and I for one do like revenge movies. It's worth a watch but only at its cheapest price are even free."
3,Movie Description,"Movie DescriptionThis a prom night that starts with mischief and leads to tragedy. These group of teens are about to find out that they can't run away from that chilling night. Prom was supposed to be memorable in a totally different way. It is about friends, fun, music, drinking and sex, but is not suppose to be about covering up murder. Ten short years have gone by since then, and now something is stalking them one by one--something with a taste for their blood, for their soul. You can never hide from the truth or from your demons in the past, but what happened on that prom night is not something that lives in the past, it hunts and kills in the present.CreditsCast: Luke Jones, Sandra Winogrocki"
3,Halo collectors & obsesive fans gather around.,This single is for the collector & the people who only like Down In It. The remixes are rediculous & added up are a waist of time if you listen to them too much. No offense Mr. Reznor. We always feel guilty for critizizing Trent!
5,The marketing strategies and ideas that made it a respected name.,"THE REXALL STORY: A HISTORY OF GENIUS AND NEGLECT covers the rise and fall of a pharmacy which became a name brand across the country before big business was a common name. Rexall was the brain child of genius Louis Liggett, who began the company in 1903. The Rexall name grew to become an accepted institution of families across the country until drug manufacturers entered the business and sunk them. Learn about not only Rexall's business and health importance, but about the marketing strategies and ideas that made it a respected name.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,Underwater Fun,"Brilliant! The case is easy to use, in fact my [...]mastered it no problem. It's easy to take photos and review them and also possible to delete photos but we tended to wait till out of the water.We found that we needed a good underwater mask to be able to see the subject clearly and the video function on the camera is what truly won me over. Taking video of my children jumping into the water and then swimming past the camera gave us some of the best footage of our holiday.One major downside is that the case FOGS UP VERY QUICKLY as the camera gets hot. I haven't discovered anyway to avoid this yet though I am still looking. This would have been extremely anoying if we were out on the reef, but by the pool we would just leave it and try again next swim."
3,Item great but Shipping terrible,Received item is perfect viewing and working condition but due to the merchandiser's shipping it to me using DHL it took excessively too long. It it had been sent to me by First Class Postal Service I would have received it in less than half the time.
5,"A ""Taste"" of what it's like in prison for a child molester.","I know it's a hard to fathom and ugly thought but put yourself into the shoes of a child molester and what it is like when you're caught and convicted and thrown in prison! What it is like to have every living soul, even your friends turning against you at the darkest and most frightening time in your life when you need someone to turn to the most but can't because of the ugly crime you commited! This movie and some of the scenes in it would be a good ""wake up call"" for anyone thinking about having sex with an underage person. The movie with some of the music and the hair styles in it has the feel of the typical late '70's like the music from ""Rocky"" or ""Saturday Night Fever"" and the disco era hairstyles.. The style of movies from then like ""Death Wish"" I highly recommend this DVD but not for the squeemish!"
4,Great Except for activity light flicker,"This is really a great wireless mouse for a laptop. It's small, travels well and the wireless USB receiver stows inside the mouse for easy packing. Like most wireless mice, you need to do something to get it active. I've found that simply pressing the left button gets it started if it's gone to sleep and that click is not interpreted so there is no risk of accidentally launching a program or other event. The one shortcoming it has is that when the mouse is sending, the blue light on the receiver which is quite bright flickers at a rapid rate and can be distracting and annoying if your laptop USB ports are on the side rather than in the back -- otherwise, I would have rated it a 5."
2,Really Disappointed in Amazon,"Due to Amazon's lack of detail descriptions, I was led to believe this was a 2 CD set. It is not! The title ""Virgil Fox: Heavy Organ (Live at Fillmore East) / More Heavy Organ (Live at Winterland)"" tells me it is two titles (note the slash) the above full title does not appear anywhere on the CD itself, so it is a deliberate deception. Also, the premo price I paid ($35.39) indicates to me to be a 2 CD SET which it is, BUT, I only got CD # 2 of the set! Again, this is NOT mentioned in the copy. There are only 8 tracks on the CD (all of them good though).The content is great, there is no one who played Bach better than Virgil Fox, God rest his soul, Virgil Fox & Bach get 5 stars. I have the vinyl version ""VIRGIL FOX- HEAVY ORGAN- BACH LIVE AT FILLMORE EAST"" and this is what I thought I was also getting. It is fantastic.What I thought I was getting and what I got was disappointing. Shame on you Amazon for practicing such subtle deception."
3,More wisdom book than manual,"There's a lot of great advice in this text, but you're just going to have to make time to read large chunks of it to gather it. This is not user-friendly if you're trying to look something up quickly between patients. The rare tables are of little use, and, seriously, how import is it that you can see a molecular model of something you are prescribing?"
4,Psychiatry resident,Great pharmacology book for the psychiatry resident. Easy to read but explains topics very well. Required reading if you're in psychiatry.
4,Good book.,I like the book. Reads well. But i think the binding on mine is messed up. I was too busy to return it w/in the window
5,A hot new talent on the Blues horizon.,"This CD blends a little of a lot of different influences into an emotional, groovable, danceable musical stew, with Freddie Brooks stirring the pot! A great harp player and songwriter who brings a unique new voice to the Blues, yet pays homage to his roots. The tight, grooving band rounds out the total package that is the Freddie Brooks Band."
1,Not at all what is shown in the picture,We ordered this because from the picture it looked like a better quality cap than some of the others. What we received looked completely different and felt cheap. I do not expect this to last more than a few weeks.
2,I do not recommend,"I don't recommend this product. I recently broke the gas cap for my old Ford Explorer. I bought this thinking that a lock would be nice. You really have to fumble around with the lock to get the gas cap to turn, it's a pain. There's a perfect point to where you turn the lock, hold the key perfectly in place, and then turn the gas cap - if you aren't at the sweet spot, it won't work."
5,Old school games on CD-ROM!!!,This is awesome! The third collection of 12 games from the 'Atari 2600' days on CD-ROM!
4,very creative songs,it is a very good cd it has a good songs no profanity or junk like that but good clean music like I like to hear.
5,not just for kids,"i wasn't much of a fan of pokemon till my little brother got me hooked on it a year ago. i absolutely love the theme song, i feel it catches the essence of the whole show and ash's mission. my sister is hooked on the song viridian city. it has that catchy tune and beat, especially when the voice in the background just throws in words like ""viridian city"" ""gotta catch them all"" etc. he's not actually singing anything but he sounds REAL good. i'm not a 9 yr old kiddy. (my bro is though) i'm actually a college student who can appreciate a good show and nice music when i see and hear it. But can someone tell me what's the difference between the blister edition and the enhanced version? anybody? i need to know. Rock on POKEMON!"
1,Did the Producers Know Their Audience?,"This CD is just KIDDYRAP, you know, rap that tries to be coolbut ends up being stupid. I mean there are older pokefans, most ofthem over 5, and this CD proves how bad material can be if you don't know your audience. Summary, IT'S C**P, and boy does this s**k! Put this CD on the burner."
1,Taking a different approach,"This CD is very disappointing for Pokémon Fans. The songs sound ""Kiddy Rap"" and get very old soon. I would suggest to hold this off unless you are part of the ""Kiddy Fanatics"""
3,"Neat-o yet, Bizzare-o","I've heard most of the sound samples, and I am a little disappointed. Pokémon is mainly for kids ranging fom ages 5-16, right? Well, this is mainly for...how should I put this....the CD seems like it's more for the younger half of the age range. This is only an estimate though. The only song I really like was Misty's song (so we now the truth about her feelings, huh? haha)"
3,"As Zelgadiss once said, ""Interesting . . . ""","Well, it's not really all that bad of a CD, but I've heard better songs on the original Japanese CD. I'm not the biggest Pokemon fan (I'm actually more into Slayers), but this is a disapointment. I'd only get this soundtrack for three of the songs, The Time Has Come, Double Trouble, and Misty's Song."
4,Ehh... not bad... but...,"One thing about this CD is that it is purely Americanized. The music is good, but they stretched and bended the concept a little too much, so now it's kind of bent-out-of-shape. Also, there is no ""Flame"" type... in case you didn't know, that was in the 2. B. A. Master song. Next, Dratini isn't the best in Dragon, Dragonite is, and so forth. The people who made these songs obviously were only watching the TV show and not playing the game. A word of advice- play the game if you only watch TV. And, on the music video, there's a picture of Poliwag instead of Poliwrath. Oh, I could go on and on and on with this stuff, but I can only enter 1000 words. Basically, this CD is too Americanized for true-blue fans like me. It doesn't have that Japanese flavor, if you know what I mean. Go buy those CDs from Japan- that's what I reccomend."
2,Main character should be a hero,"This was my second, and last, Joe DeMarco novel. I prefer the main character to be heroic is some aspect. While it's great that Emma is smart,capable and has amazing resources, its disconcerting to have the supporting role be so superior and more functional. I get the social commentary that government employees are sub-standard intellectually and morally, but feel strongly that the main character should be heroic, or at least not weak and indecisive. Joe does more harm to incidental characters and never protects anyone he puts in danger. What's that about? We should admire him for feeling guilty? Without Emma and her contacts, he is inept."
4,Promising Debut,"Emma is great.I agree with other reviewers on the main points and just have one cavil. I don't care how many deep-dyed villains Mr. Lawson puts in his imaginary South, but I wish he'd been more accurate about the region. He has Southerners addressing ONE person as ""y'all"", which we don't. And in Folkston, Georgia, a place at least sophisticated enough to have its own website (I looked), he has a woman in her mid-forties slumping around in a ""housedress"" (does ANYONE North or South wear those any more?) and a younger woman who is so ignorant (or should I say ""iggerant""?) that she has never seen or heard of an alligator logo on an upscale shirt but apparently thinks it's a cute tribute to the Okefenokee Swamp.Less stereotyping please!"
3,Enjoyable but flawed,"Two suspicious, semi-principal characters become mysteriously wealthy in the early Sixties. One of them who later becomes head of the Secret Service pays ""income taxes"" on a supposed ""inheritance."" This sort of inane ""clue"" detracts rather than enhances the story, which otherwise is enjoyable though not entirely gripping. The characters DeMarco and Emma are also enjoyable, but many readers will guess the gist of the surprise ending long before it is ""revealed."""
2,So bogus the book levitated into the trashcan.,"The other Lawson book I read, Second Perimiter, was pretty good, so I got this earlier book - That was a mistake. Maybe he was just learning his trade on this one, but the hero, DeMarco was doing things like refusing to arm himself or take simple precautions when he knows his life is threatened. Later, we have the scene where he is talking to a woman at her remote house when Surprise! the bad guy and his elderly boss suddenly join the conversation. They were not heard driving up or walking on the porch ? That was too much for me and I tossed the book."
3,Good pace but poor plot and characters,The further into the book you get the weaker the plot becomes and the more preposterous the characters get. The political intrigue is just lame and the villain of the piece makes Boss Hogg look complex.
3,A Vince Flynn or Nelson DeMille in the Making?,"Not bad for a first time novel, but there is plenty of room for improvement....especially in development of the characters and action as it springs forth...a good story (Apparent Assassination of the President by an ""Insider""), but it lacks the page turning urgency of a Flynn or DeMille novel...Still, a good first effort and worth the read...Michael Lawson is a writer to keep an eye on, but he's not there yet."
4,Insider Fun,"When Nancy Pearl recommended this writer, Mike Lawson, by comparing him to Ross Thomas, i immediately ordered the book. Lots of fun and maybe alittle bit true too. I like a good laugh and likely characters. All of Mike Lawson's have both."
4,"Nice socks, wrong color","I bought socks for my husband and my mom. They love non-skid socks! My mom wanted Royal Blue, and my husband wanted Black. Unfortunately, I was sent all Royal Blue. Besides the color error, these socks fit and feel great, good construction, and warm. I would recommend these to others, as long as they didn't care about what color they may or may not get."
4,Work as advertised!!!,"These slipper socks are great. They come fast and work for what you need them to do!!! Wish they were a little thicker, but I still like them!!!"
4,slipper socks that are the best,"Great sock. A nice easy fit. I like the colors, and you can mix and match for fun. These socks are a must."
1,I love my socks,my socks are warm and cozy. I like to wear them at night after I take my shower and put on my pajamas and settle in for the night. The bottoms are thick enough that I don't feel the floor when I walk across the room.I purchased my slipper socks at Amazon.
4,It's alright.,"For the money. It's not a lot of toy, but if your child is into this type of stuff. Got to have it!!!!!!"
1,weired mounting mechanism,"I bought 4 of these, 2 for light and 2 for heavy cymbals. I bought them without having had any experience - just some youtube videos. Unfortunately the mounting mechanism that attaches the spring to the stand totally ruins the thread of the cymbal holder - even after one tightening!!!! I am glad I used it on a cymbal stand that is old and not one of my newer ones!!!! I never used any of these!!!! I read the reviews that deny this......."
1,Good --- As Long as it lasts - New Rating 4 stars,"I am an active older individual (64) with a heart that is prone to an irregular hearbeat, even atrial fibrillation. I felt this was a godsend for someone of my condiition and who was not ready to become totally sedentary. It worked as advertised for a while but would occasionally refuse to inflate and return an Err -2. Until today, I could just try it again and it would work fine. Well today, it just stopped inflating at all. All I get is an Err -2 and the instructions say contact the retailer. I would like to exchange it for one that works but it failed not quite 60 days after purchase. However, after I little determined digging I finally found the right button to push. I got an almost immediate exchange, have received my new one and all is sweetness and light again. I'd change the rating to 4 stars but won't let me."
4,MF-84 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,My husband and I use the monitor as we travel over the road in a semi truck. It is so easy to use and small in size so is easy to store. We like it a lot better than the pump up arm monitors.
5,Working Great,Easy to use. Accurate upon testing. Have to be careful about arm position or error message comes up. Will never go back to arm style. Pulse reader easy to see. We are very happy we have this item.
3,"Right size, wrong readings",I liked it's compact size but the readings I get are never the same as the manual or the other electronic monitors I have. It reads higher. There is no adjustment for this or no mention why this happens.
1,terrible,I am suppose to be receiving a refund because I have done sent it back but I have not heard anything from ya'll.
1,poor accuracy,"This BP Monitor was accurate for about the first 2 weeks of use. BP from monitor checked closely with manual BP. After the first 2 weeks, got very inaccurate results dispite replacing the batteries. I can not rely on this monitor for my patient's B/P results."
3,BLURB-O-RAMA,"I started the book because I like Mexico stuff. However I discovered shortly that I couldn't bond with the characters. So I eighty-sixed it. It could be a very good book. Or not. What was really cool was the blurbs on the back cover. Jerry Stahl used ""riveting,"" ""searing"" and ""wire-taut"" in one sentence. Wow! Stokes Howell used the word ""hallucinatory."" (I guess since he used it Jerry couldn't.) The picture of Joy in the back reminded me of that girl in the French movie that found that box of old toys. A little older though, obviously."
5,A book to own,"Not just as a study of black white photography. The power of emotion these photos emit is staggering. I bought it while getting over divorce, so the palpable emotion felt between subjects of May's pics was unbearable. I wept flipping thru it. Really strong."
5,As good as it gets,"I'm really glad to have bought the book, it's wonderful and exceptional. Exceptional because it shows amazing high-quality erotic images without being pornographic at all. I can only recommend this item! Stefan Mays other books are also worth looking it. I love them."
4,Beautiful Imagery,"I thoroughly enjoyed the imagery presented in this book. The journeys of the soul were mesmerizing. The guidance for drumming was most useful. The songs presented were short, easy to remember, and inspiring. I was a little put off at the end when the author seems to imply that the book is more for the use of Native Americans (although I have some Cherokee ancestry) and not for people of other descents."
4,More than drumming,"I expected a book which explained the fundamentals of shamanic drumming but I got much more than that. Just as 'The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' has little to do with motorcycling or maintaining them, this book explains more about Shamanism than it does about drumming although it also does an excellent job of revealing the integral part that drumming plays in Shamanic practice.The author, Michael Drake, is an accomplished musician as well as a dedicated Shaman. He writes in a style that is pleasant to read and connects his points in a logical manner. I would have rated this 5 stars if he had included a CD with some examples of Shamanic drumming. He has released a few CD's but they all include other instrumentation to give them a pop-jazz feeling. I would like to hear only shamanic drumming with no frills which are intended to make it more acceptable to non-shaman listeners.Michael, how about a pure shamanic drumming CD?"
2,Not at all what i expected,"well its a good book but in comparison to the other books, its really quite a boring book."
1,"Too Dark, Too Slow, too Cruel","This book starts off as a fairly interesting story but becomes mundane about midway through and absolutely darkly cruel toward the end. The idea of making a child believe that a beloved pet has been intentionally tortured and burned to death is too dark to consider, much less allow to enter the realm of any impressionable child's thoughts. NOT recommended."
4,Hypnotism and More,"Hypnotic time travel advemtures and going back in time - what a great concoction of adventures! This is an awesome book if you like hypnotism and time traveling. In this book Molly Moon has a dog named Petula. Molly and Petula are trying to save the world from this master of hypnotism,Cornelius Logan. Molly and Petula have to use their hypnotic powers to try and stop him.How do they save the world from Cornelius Logan? Read the book to find out.I enjoyed reading this book because it was very exciting. I also liked reading this book because I like hypnotism and time traveling. I really liked the adventures that happened when Molly used hypnotism on characters in the story. I think a lot of people would enjoy reading this book. I would recomend this book to girls,but some boys might like it too. This is a awesome book!"
3,Molly Moon,"After the exitment and scheme of the first book the third and second books were kind of a let-down.A lot of books do that and I find this book is no exeption. Same old story. Every time you think you have found the power crazed manic , you find out he has a master , a more power crazed manic than him/her."
1,Not What I Expected ... At All,"The first two Molly Moon books were really great, they grabbed me in and held me until I was done with every single word in them. By far, the first two books were my favorite in the world. I was really excited to read the third book, hoping that it would be just the same. But Nope, that isn't what happened at all. This book turned out extremely slow and boring. Even reading the book made me feel lethargic. It draggged along, with maybe one cool thing per. chapter if you were lucky. It was definetely the worst Molly Moon book so far, not really worth reading. But, if you really want to see how bad it is (I know I would), then you should get it. Then you can write a review for it on Amazon.com, and say how much you hated it! Happy Reading - I wish you luck, whoever is brave enough to read this boring book!!"
4,Brilliant reading,Once again this book is great for 7-10 year olds. My granddaughter has become an avid reader due to this series of books. Full of imagination and very captivating.
2,Not very exciting,"I love Country-Western, but this was very disappointing. It has a few good songs, but otherwise not much to write home about. I guess for $4.62 you can't expect much. I gave it away."
4,A Must for your Knitting Library,"While not as extensive as some multi-volume stitch collections; this book is a handy and indispensible reference. The stitches are organized by type, thumbnailed for quick selection, and photographed adequately. The instructions are easy to follow."
3,It's ok,I thought that the book was interesting. It's a little dated. And the charting diagrams make you have to constantly go to the back of the book for the key. I think I was expecting more from it.
5,Knitters catnip!,"I bought this book as a gift for my sister who coveted my copy. After I overcame my anxiety about using charts, this book became a very useful tool for the knitter with a bit of experience. Probably not the best for a beginner though something to aspire to. Great design tool."
4,Practical,"This is a handy little book. It contains a decent amount of stitches, not too much, it's good for a beginner. It's layout is super friendly, great pictures and nice graphs. The fact that is small and ring bound makes it even more practical. Would give it 5 stars had it had more stitches."
5,¡ I Want You Is Great Single !,"1. I Want You (Radio Edit) (5/5)2. Its My Party (5/5)3. I Want You (Pablo Flores Club Mix) (5/5)Magnifico Es Estupendo, Deberia de havber puesto Mas Canciones Porque en Verdad es una Excelente cancion."
5,Perfect Kitchen Tool,"We bought a KitchenAid two years ago and use it all the time. Mixing cookie dough or whipping cream is a breeze. It's solid and stable (won't tip) and is well made. We've never had a problem. Lot's of accessories are available, but it's the basics you'll really appreciate."
5,Another great CD from Seasick Steve,"Another great CD from Seasick Steve. If you are a fan, a must to add to your collection. We wished he'd come to the US more often."
2,Pretty bad,"Having read many tales of the supernatural (my favorite being Dorothy Macardle's The Uninvited), I looked forward to reading this. But after a promising start, I was disappointed to find this book to be pretty dull and I skimmed most of the last 200 of 300 pages. It's a journal written by a crippled RAF airmen and his rambling discourses are sometimes very boring. The story could have been trimmed by 100 or more pages at least. It's not really a ghost story, either. Not recommended, and hard to understand how it has such a good reputation."
4,Interesting Book,"I had watched the movie The Haunted Airman which is based on The Haunting of Toby Jugg before I read it. I usually do not do that but I read that the book was way better than the movie (which it was) so I wanted to see what it was all about. I enjoyed the book very much even though it was tough to get through in some places. There was a lot of religious talk in it that I personally didn't agree with, but I didn't write the book and I know that I don't have to agree with the opinions of others. Anyway, all in all I enjoyed the book and the interesting twists and turns that took place. It was a good read."
5,VERY GOOD READ....SO FAR,"okay I got this book about a week ago and I'm in the last chapter I believe so I'm not done, but this book is really good. of course there are alot of things in this story that are a contradiction, if you claim to be a christian, but all in all it's very good and it does cause you to think and consider certain things concerning spiritual warfare, faith, satan and demons."
4,The Haunting of Toby Jigg,"I am enjoying the book, and I love the way you kept me posted of it's arrival."
3,A faux legacy,"Liberace was from my hometown, Milwaukee. When I was a kid all the old ladies used to like to watch him on TV and say what a nice guy he was. They truly believed he was a bachelor who hadn't met the right girl yet, he took such good care of his mother and he had such a nice personality. Well, Liberace was sick with AIDS when this book was published less than a year before he died. He never admitted being sick -- in fact he referenced the rumors and dismissed them. He told stories of his seduction by women (only), and he showcased his horrendously over-the-top material boy life. He was writing a book about how he wanted to be remembered, with a tremendous amount of spin. It was just the way the old ladies in Milwaukee would have wanted to remember him. Even at the end of his life he was Mr. Showmanship. This book is very amusing and kitschy but it is especially valuable to demonstrate the way the mid-1980s world could deny the realities of AIDS and homosexuality."
2,Thinly Edited,"While I appreciate the breadth of this collection, Olson and Worsham have failed to include even minimal scholarly apparatus. The introduction is anemic. No context is given for any of the contributors. This is especially problematic for a collection with such diverse inclusions as Homi Bhabha & Luce Irigaray. The original sources of the interviews are not given(!), which makes it impossible to date any of the selections. It's probably just as well to choose the theorists you care about most and download the PDF of the complete interview from JAC."
5,replenishing,"Months of writing my thesis and reading these dense theorists, it is so helpful to read them in a more converstational way. These interviews really add a much needed presective to their theoroes and the ideologies of writing in general."
4,Just guide bushings,Not a whole lot to say here. These are just Bosch guide bushings and they work well....not alot to them.
1,"Ok, but not great","To use this on Bosch routers, you still need to get the RA1126. PC style threaded templet guides are better.Just get RA1126 + RA1100 and brass PC style threaded templet guides.Never should have bought this."
2,USe?,"I bought these to go with a router I bought from Amazon and even though it is recommended to be used with the specific router I bought, I can't figure out how it can be used."
1,Can't Mount Without RA1126 Adapter,"I ordered this template guide set and expect to get working with the Bosch router right away. I was so wrong. None of the template guide will fit in my new Bosch 1617 router base. They all fall straight through. I found out that you need another adapter, RA1126, before you can use these guide bushings. What the heck. I don't see that described in any of the product descriptions. I had to go to the Bosch website and search for it. Bosch even made it difficult to purchase because none of its recommended vendors have this in stock.So my project is on hold while the adapter is on backorder. Why doesn't Bosch include this quick change adapter to the kit or even in the router? I buy the tool and have to wait for Bosch to nickle and dime me."
1,Bosch template guides,"I own 4 Bosch routers and the weakest link to such a good router is the templates, Two broke while using the router, destroying the template guide the bit and the peice of work. Very furstationg when this occurs. there is no excuse for this product being made by Bosch."
5,No problems,"I purchased this product so I could do some dovetail work with my Bosch router. The locking insert worked perfectly with the dovetail guide that I bought. I have only used the one piece out of it so far, but I'm completely happy. I only got the ground shipping when I ordered it but I had it in a few days."
3,"Does not include adapter, neither does the router!","I echo the comments by others. I purchase a new bosch router and this set of template guides. Imagine my surprise when neither the router nor the guides had the adapter to use them together. On top of that it is not even offered by amazon. not a huge deal, but uncool(i also ordered the deluxe PC dovetailing jig and was looking forward to taking it for a spin this weekend)"
3,Still need more parts,"Bosch routers when purchased do not have any means of using the Router Template Guide Set without also purchasing a Template Guide Adapter, which is also a Bosch accessory, not included with the original router. I would recommend Bosch adding the Template Guide Adapter as part of the ""SET""."
5,Bosch RA1125 7-piece router template guide set,The template guides make it easier to make accurate cuts when used in conjunction with jigs. The set allows you to accomodate various bit sizes.
2,Comes up short,Nice idea to have the quick change guides. They don't hold up to actual use. They are made of two pieces and become loose after only a couple uses. Disappointed I am.
3,Not the only accessory you need,"When buying this product, be aware that you also need an adapter (RA1126) to attach the template guides to the router. Amazon does not sell this item and doesn't inform the buyer that it is required. I had to buy it from International Tools, which took 2 weeks. What a pain!Also, you'll need a screwdriver to remove some of the template guides from the case because they are snapped in so tightly."
3,Must have for Bosch router..,"If you have a Bosch router these quick insert templates are a must.Pros: Cheap, quick insertCons: Cheap, templates aren't precision machines, need to spend extra time centeringConclusion: Although I wouldn't use them with a dovetail jig, them seem to work for just about everything else."
5,bosch Template guides,This product was exactly what I was expecting. If fit very securely and easy to my Router base. I've only been wood crafting for about 3 years but this worked great with my Dove Tail jigs and some miscellaneous templates. If you own a Bosch and looking for a template this was shipped out and I recieved them with in 72 hours regular shipping.Happy Customer.
1,didn't last long,"My bit was rubbing the side of the guide a little, the guide heated up and came apart. Ruined an expensive bit. These are cheap garbage."
3,Good design,"Pretty good product, good design.Compared to other brands, material used appears cheaper but the be design offsets the quality.Frankly, I would have preferred high strength brass alloy over the material used.I would buy again, just wish it was higher quality"
3,Template Guides,"The guides work alright, but I found the gap between the guide base and the template adapter to be almost too large to be practical for most applications. The best piece in this set, in my opinion, is the threaded bushing adapter. This allows the user to use smaller 'screw-in type' bushing plates typically used for Porter Cable routers. The benefit to these is that the additional adapter will bring the bushing plate up to level with the face of the router base -- making template and jig work much easier than using a similarily sized guide that comes with this same set."
3,"Nice set, needs yet another part","I had a Hitachi router kit that came with a fixed base, plunge base, a set of template guides, and a centering tool. When it was stolen, I grabbed the Bosch kit with the fixed and plunge bases.I then ordered their edge guide (which seems nice, although I haven't used it yet) and this set of template guides (another 27 bucks on top of the cost of the router kit). When it came, I was surprised to find that, lo and behold (and as the description says, d'oh) I need yet another part to actually connect any of these guides to the router.So as much as I like the router, and the set of guides, I have to say that I'm getting a little tired of continuing to spend money on parts for this router that were all included with my Hitachi router. I hope the quick change adapter will be the last thing I need."
2,incomplete set,This set doesn't include the bushing insert. It's sold separately.That's ok but it would be good if this info was included in the description.
3,"OK, but here's a way to save money","The Bosch template adapters are handy due to the quick-change feature, but they are poorly made, among the few Bosch products I don't enthusiastically recommend. If you own a set of Porter-Cable adapters, you can save $15 by getting the RA1100 PC-Bosch adapter alone. Amazon has it for less than $7. It is cast (not stamped), solid, and locks into my Bosch routers very securely. The PC adapters fit the RA1100 very closely, so there are no problems with slop or poor centering. This is my preferred method of using template adapters on my Bosch routers.BOSCH Tool-free Templet Guide Adapter for Competitor Templet Guides RA1100"
4,not bad,"These work allright but aren't the best made guide bushings out there. They're made up of 2 pieces pressed together kind of like a rivet. They're ok, but not heavy duty. The Porter Cable type guide bushings are a little beefier & made with thicker metal. What I ended up using was just the PC adapter (available by itself at any wood working store), a set of PC guide bushings (available anywhere) & a centering pin. Make sure to close the lever tight on the Bosch template adapter, otherwise it can move around & the bit won't be centered in the bushing. Personally I find these reviews very helpful & want to say thanks to the people who write them. They can definitely save us some time, money & headaches. If you have an opinion on a product I encourage you to put it in writing. Happy wood working!!"
3,"Okay for some, but utilizes 2-piece construction","This set seems okay, but it utilizes 2-piece construction, so the guide can loosen or eventually separate from the base. I think the most useful part of the kit is the RA1100 adapter, which can be used to install Porter-Cable (PC) style threaded template guides on the Bosch router sub-base. You can pick up PC threaded template guides just about anywhere. The RA1100 adapter is available separately for about $7:Bosch RA1100 Threaded Router Template Guide AdapterFor reference, the following adapter sizes are included in this Bosch kit:RA1100: threaded template guide adapterRA1103: 5/16"" OD, 17/64"" ID, 9/64"" depthRA1105: 7/16"" OD, 3/8"" ID, 9/64"" depthRA1109: 1/2"" OD, 13/32"" ID, 7/16"" depthRA1113: 5/8"" OD, 17/32"" ID, 1/2"" depthRA1115: 3/4"" OD, 21/32"" ID, 3/16"" depthRA1121: 1-3/8"" OD, 1-19/64"" ID, 7/16"" depth"
1,poorly made product is this Harbor Freight,"my experience is the same as KB,s, cheaply made and not up to bosch standards.mine snapped at the junction and job blown.mike"
3,Buy a clear base and brass templates.,Not very well made and not what I would expect from Bosch. There is too much play in the guides when they are seated in the holder. A better solution is to replace the stock base with a clear base with a standard opening that will accept regular guides.
3,"Very good tools, but not so good accessories.","Bosch certainly makes some very fine power tools, but this accessory is very poor in my opinion. It is not any easier to install than Porter-Cable, and quality is lacking. The case is very poor. It is very difficult to get the guides out and to put them back. They really should use a system like the Porter-Cable. Porter-Cable is simple, easy and very accurate. These even have ""cheap"" appearance."
2,"Sounds great, but not realistic","This book is a quick read but successfully implementing the suggestions in the book is unlikely. The cover looks great, though, and the idea is appealing. But in the end, its like daydreaming... pleasant thoughts but not realistic for the vast majority of people. Even when it was published, which was before the drop off in eBay buyers and recent inflation in China, this book was (and is now) useless to most people."
3,Straight & forward,A simple & good approach to those unfamilliar with the basics of our new commercial world: Outsoursing & trading!a must read to starters & non internet amateurs.
2,Save your money-Volume Sucks,These are not amplified so they only 'whimper'....you'll be sadly disappointed in the volume. Save your money and buy a stereo to stereo plug ($7-10 at Radioshack) and play the Archos through any radio/boombox/stereo that has an AUX jack.
3,"Fun to color, not for keeps","This is a pretty complete coloring gift set. My niece was really excited about all the different things included for her to color and create. The only problem was that the materials were made of thin, recycled paper that bleed when you used the included markers. We decided to use crayons instead but since there were only 8 in the box, we used her 64 crayons she already had from Crayola.Because of the poor quality of the paper, you could see the colored image on the other side of the paper through the page, even when we used crayons. They should have made each page one-sided instead of two. After coloring the included stickers with the included markers, the colors began to smear and create a big mess.All this aside, I gave it three stars because my niece still enjoyed coloring the different pictures. You're better off buying a few coloring books and supplying markers and crayons. You'll probably pay slightly more but it'll be worth it."
4,Packaging not equal to product's quality,"The brand name is as reliable as ever; but the shipping carton was so flimsy that the end rung at one end was bent. It did bend back and the only objection is that it isn't perfectly straight. However, it does not compromise the use of this high-quality product at all."
1,poorly engineered,"Installing the wall uprights very straightforward, until we discovered that we were missing 6 of the 14 anchors and screws, $5.31 later we completed the upright installation. the we installed the brackets, easy. Finally, we tried to follow the instructions for securing the shelving on all four brackets, 1 hour later we have not completed the first shelve, we get one bracket in but cannot get the next one.I would call this a poorly engineered product, with limited quality control"
2,Not her Best Effort,"Normally a fan of her novels, I'm glad I read the library's copy and didn't spend my cash to buy this one. The characters were so annoying I couldn't help but think perhaps they all got what they deserved. Poorly crafted dialogue and no sense of direction didn't help."
1,Not Even Average,"I read through Chapter 7, at which point I simply gave up. How a supposedly brilliant woman could surround herself with such despicable characters spoiled the underlying ""mystery"". An ex-husband, who personifies ""looser"", a whiney, spoiled brat college age daughter and a lover who is totally one-dimensional. These characters were so bad that I just couldn't care enough about the story to even finish the book.A very disappointing read."
2,Many many errors,"The whole story was pretty good. There were so many many errors, spelling, grammer and words. Is this whose fault. I would really like to know. I have never found so mayy."
3,Past Uncovered,"I read Nancy Taylor Rosenberg's BURIED EVIDENCE soon after reading MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES and was very comfortable with the characters though I had a hard time accepting the self-centeredness of the ex-husband. He attempts to get himself off from a vehicular homicide by exposing his ex-wife's viglanti murder of a criminal in the original story.It was a fast and easy read, that is perfect for when your attention is not recquired to interact with the story. It just dawned on me what I didn't like about the book. It was too much like reading MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES a second time. The sequel was too much like the first book, but not strong enough to be a continuation.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
3,"Story was ok, too many mistakes","I enjoyed the book as a whole, but I was disappointed in the number of errors. What happened to the editor? There were at least five grammatical errors and a couple of errors in the story. For example, when Shana and her friend went to the duplex to pick up Shana's stuff, they decided to take the van. The opening sentence of the next chapter even stated that the ""van"" arrived at such and such a time. Then, moments later, the detective sees two young women loading items into Lily's Audi. So what happened to the van? It was very frustrating to me. On at least two occasions, male and female pronouns were used incorrectly. I blame these things more on the editor than the author, but it really took away from the novel as a whole."
2,Ho hum,"This is the first book I read by Ms. Rosenberg and I'm not sure if it will be my last since I have another one on my shelf to read. I found the book slow and boring. Ms. Rosenburg writes like this was a sequal, but yet it isn't. I've been corrected it is a sequal, sorry. Things are mentioned liked we, as the read, are suppose to know already about them. The characters in the book are ho hum. They are very one sided or flat. Many different story lines start the book and then are dropped when the ""real story"" starts. Then they are picked back up later and treated as not important. I will say this Ms. Rosenburg does know about the law, but knowing about the law and writing an interesting book about it are two totally different things."
2,Disappointing,"I eagerly awaited the latest Nancy Taylor Rosenberg novel and was very disappointed by the characters. Lily was annoying and her daughter, Shana, bordered on the unstable. I found every character to be unpleasant and obnoxious. That said, some of the story line had interesting turns. I've enjoyed Ms. Rosenberg's books in the past and hope that I enjoy the next one more than ""Buried Evidence""."
2,A weak thriller with no character development.,"The protagonist of Nancy Taylor Rosenberg's latest thriller, ""Buried Evidence,"" is Lily Forrester, a prosecutor with multiple problems. She has a deadbeat ex-husband, a troubled daughter, and a stormy past, including some dark secrets that she is desperate to keep hidden. This novel falls short on a number of counts. The dialogue is stilted, the characters are undeveloped and the plot is contrived and unrealistic. Lily's character never comes alive. Her love interest is Richard Fowler, a gorgeous and wealthy lawyer who holds a torch for Lily. Neither Lily's and Richard's relationship nor the various legal plot lines in ""Buried Evidence"" held my intrerest. This is a thriller that never comes to life."
4,very informative book,"Yes, homebuying can be an overwhelming process. There is a lot that goes into the process that most people don't even consider. This author attempts to make that as painless as possible and gives you detailed information. I bought several other books as well because I wanted to be as knowleable as possible and not be suprised about what may be lurking around the corner. Even though it was not the right time for us to purchase a home I'm glad I had this book to guide me along."
5,Excellent Book in Excellent Condition,I am very impressed with this book considering I am about to buy a house and was ignorant to the process before reading this book..
4,You will change,"Confessions of a Spent Youth is bold. Unafraid of the warped, pre-p.c. agendas of the 1950's-60's, it is an honest tale of a young man peering through the mask of hormones, war, death, sex, and the constant inhaling of random drugs and liquors. Riding with Quincy is an adventure.Probably the most memorable aspect of the book is the boyish way it is written. He's curious in his egotism, shocking in his innocence. He doesn't try to grab your collar and make you feel some fake emotion that's more outrage than empathy.He's real.Yes - this book is... good."
3,Lots of info here,"I am still reading this book. I got bogged down because it's kind of dry compared to the previous book in the series, but it is clearly well researched and informative. But dry."
4,Longer,"Are you crazy you want a longer book? It's a great book very readable well structured. But, it could have had a little more on foriegn affairs Spanish Civil War etc. This brings me to my main point. By the third volume there will be enough pages to put out a 4th volumne taking the footnote pages. Evans himself said he only used footnotes for references not additional information. Put them on the web for God's sake.Even those few who would read this book and don't have the web won't be missing anything"
5,Readable history,"What an achievement. One of the pre-eminent Third Reich scholars teaching today has written an incredible synthesis. (The bibliography is 74-pages long and includes about a dozen of his own books!) In seven sections, covering everything from the economy to racial policy to education to militarization, Evans takes us from 1933, when Hitler became chancellor, to 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. (The third book, THE THIRD REICH AT WAR, takes it from there.) Extremely well-written and easy to read -- though I did pause at the end of each section to either read a few magazines or another book (a sort of palate cleanser), which greatly increased the odds that I would finish this 700-page tome."
1,Kindle Version Too Expensive,Why is the Kindle version more expensive than the paperback? This makes no sense when one considers that it is much more costly to print a book on paper. I refuse to buy this book until the Kindle price is lowered.
4,Volume 2 of the trilogy,"This is the second volume (published in 2005) of Evans' trilogy. I read the first volume, The Coming of the Third Reich, on 9 Oct 2009. This volume extends from tthe summer of 1933 to Sep 3, 1939, and traces how the Nazis took over Germany, body and soul, during that time. It is not pleasant nor easy reading, at least until the final chapters when the way Hitler drove to war is set out , which reading while not pleasant expounds the way Hitler sought to have war, even though his brain-washed people still did not want such, in contrast to the giddy German joy in July 1914."
2,A Good Book But...,A highly detailed coverage of the Third Reich as it rose to and consolidated its power in Germany during the 1930 decade. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone interested in analysing events leading up to World War II.The Devil however is in the details. The author makes sweeping statements about the Versaille treaty that are neither logical or reasonable. He fails to place the beginnings of the practice of racial hygiene in Germany within the larger context of the worldwide movement in that area. When he mentions the Spanish civil war he quotes from some sources that are known to be inaccurate.These are just a few areas where the author has been less than thorough. Despite the foregoing I would gladly urge people interested in the history of the Twentieth century to read this book; always bearing in mind that this obviously vast subject is covered incompletely here.
5,works well,This tea is really good tasting and it works well. There was the matter of getting up at night to urinate though.
4,good product,have been looking for this tea for long finally got it. this will help anyone get a good balance in their system
4,Gentle Bouquet,"I love the smell of Lemon Balm. This has a nice hint of Lemon Balm to it and is smooth, but I think that it needs a little more strength to it."
5,Morning sickness!,This tea cures morning sickness! Everything else has failed this has been my savior! I drink it warm as soon as I feel queasiness coming on.
5,Beautiful family celebration of adoption.,"Cheerful, brightly colored book done in song that celebrates the uniting of a family via adoption. I am a parent on her way to adopt her child internationally and I was looking for a good children's and family book. Most books I saw treated adoption as ""different"" or a ""problem"". This book celebrates! Very cool"
2,I Wanted To Like This Book,"Books about adoption are very important to me. My wife and I have adopted two girls from China so we want to read them stories that show adoption as something beautiful. Happy Adoption Day has great color, lots of smiles, and even comes with a song that you can play on the piano or some other instrument. Unfortunately I didn't like some of McCutcheon's lyrics. I don't like how he repeatedly says, For out of a world so tattered and torn, You came to our house on that wonderful morn..."". The entire world is messed up, and I don't like this ""we saved you"" mentality. Elsewhere John writes, ""Some parents come different, some come the same..."". If you come from a conservative mindset, I can see how you might want to explain this in a different manner."
2,Do not appreciate reference to homosexuality,"At first I thought this book was a wonderful learning tool and good story for my newborn son. However, the reference that some parents 'come the same' and the picture of a lesbian couple walking with a little girl was very inappropriate for an adoption book. Why do homosexual references need to be in a CHILDREN'S book??? This only opens up the opportunity for a young child to ask an awful lot of questions about same sex relationships, perhaps BEFORE a parent is ready to discuss. I will not be reading this book again."
4,"Colorful, happy, especially nice for foreign born adoptees",Nice child like illustrations. Uses families of all ethnic background in the illutrations. Great sing song (music tape available) reading. My son loves it and wants to read it again and again!
1,Upbeat but somewhat awkward and disturbing word choices,"After reading this book my husband and I were a little disheartened by some of the content. We are hesitant to be able to enjoy this book with our little one from China because of the words, ""For out of a world so tattered and torn, You came to our house on that wonderful morn..."" We don't want to make her feel like she came out of the ghetto to come to us and want her to feel good about her birth country. Anyway, there's no getting away from these words--they appear on 4 pages of this little book and of course the song also includes them. It sounds a little arrogant to us, sort of like, Good riddance to China... We were disappointed in the book for this reason."
4,Conflicting info in Product Review Section,"Why does the reading level under ""Product Details"" say ages 4-8, when reviews by School Library Journal and others say that this a book for toddlers and kindergarteners? Judging from the text, I cannot believe that an eight-year-old would be interested in this book. Please be more thoughtful with your product descriptions."
2,It was OK,"It was OK, but is not my favorite nor is it a favorite of my daughter. Families are Forever was much better."
1,As an adoptee...,"While I understand the intent of the book is genuine, it does not acknowledge the LOSS that the adoptee must feel and grieve throughout their life.Celebrating the day an adoptee came to their new family is great for the family; but it is also the day they will NEVER be able to return to their biological family. It is the day they officially have no recourse; no possibility to go back.As an adult adoptee, I can sympathize with the reasoning behind it; it does echo ""acceptance."" but, what many adopted parents also need to acknowledge is that the loss many adoptees feel - can never be forgotten or even mended by acceptance."
5,Happy Adoption Day,This book has wonderful illustrations and my kids love it. You must get the CD (song #10) by John McCutcheon . We listen to it each adoption day.
5,Sings a joyful song,"Generally, science fiction anthologies are a mixed bag, some terrific stories, some terrible stories that you think may be in there just because the author has a ""name."" Space Opera, however, is nothing like any anthology I have ever read before. It is a one-note song, but that one note sings a joyful song. Made up of short stories commissioned for this anthology, they all share a theme, music. Within that theme, there are as many variations as the human mind can devise. Some stories are only tenuously connected with music, like the faintest hum. Others throb, resonate and pound into your brain like Sony's megabass. But all are worth reading, and some reading 2 or 3 or 4 times to capture all the rich nuances. For anyone who loves science fiction and music, Space Opera is a rare find and a thrilling melody. I particularly enjoyed the story contributed by Elizabeth Ann Scarborough, and not just because we are both nurses. Anne Berson RN (bersonfamily@worldnet.att.net)"
4,very good anthology,"I liked these stories and thought they were well-chosen. Anne McCaffrey & Elizabeth Ann Scarbourough make a good team. It was an interesting concept, mixing music and science fiction. This was a very good book for a collection, although I did prefer McCaffrey's Pern series."
2,Not bright enough,"I love Vanessa Willams' voice and was really looking forward to adding this CD to my Christams celebrations each year, but I unfortunately found it a souless experience. There are just too many slow and quiet songs on 'Star Bright' and they begin to sound the same. I think she needed a better producer and arranger for 'Star Bright' as her voice is as beatuiful as ever. There is one track I truly love, and it's her gospel version of ""Mary Had A Baby/Go Tell It On The Mountain"" but it's also found on David Fosters 'The Christas Album' which I enjoy much more than this CD."
4,LOVE Vanessa Williams!,"I always wanted her Christmas CDs and I just received ""Star Bright""... and love it. BUT... am I just stupid, or on ""Do You Hear What I Hear/ The Little Drummer Boy,"" is there actually NO 'Little Drummer Boy?' I listened to it twice in a row and I swear I didn't hear that song. Maybe I'm just getting old and senile! lol."
5,Perfection,"Vanessa Williams' voice is truly perfect for this collection of traditional and pop Christmas songs. Truly, the best Christmas album I've heard by a solo artist. (i.e. not chorale--such as the Mormon Tabernacle choir)"
3,writing,"book had a handwritten note on inside cover. didn't think that was part of deal, even though it was used. Janet S McLean"
4,Good product for good price,"This is a good product, good fit. i am a medium build and ordered a medium. that was my only mistake. my chest is a 36"" so i should have gotten a L. other than some sizing confusion there is nothing to complain about"
2,Don't waste money on this!,"I usually enjoy all kind of movies. I like some of Kurosawa's films.Before I saw this movie, I was excited about it, because it's famous Kurosawa's movie! However, just 30 minutes later I felt this movie was so boring and also acting was so bad. Especially, Mifune, I really couldn't understand what he was saying. Speak clearly!! Also the other actors aren't that good either.The story isn't so impressive or entertaining at all, you'll just get depressed by watching this movie.Don't waste your money on this, it doesn't mean all Kurosawa's films are great! This is a really weak film of his."
4,How low can Humans sink?,"As the title this is a film that shows a group of People gathered together in an Inn at Edo (tokyo).They have one thing in common, that is that they all have reached the bottom of their life.Akira Kurosawa have created a great atmosphere of Gorki`s play that you feel right away.We have many aspects of Humans shown and what poornes, depression and anxiety can drive them to do.Kurosawa made a very dark and tense atmosphere in order to show the ""lowest of the low"" and to rip away anny hope of happyness.It`s a very ""depressing"" movie but it`s a lot of humour in it."
3,Brilliantly Simplistic and Uplifting,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie, but it's an amazing film. It goes to show you that you don't need fancy sets (or in this case, many) or overly elaborate characters. The film centers around a group of nearly poor Japanese people who stay at a hotel and squander what little money they have on rent and sake. They live with little hope of advancement in their lives, until one day a pleasant old man comes by and boosts everyone's spirits. Finally, the people feel that they have a reason to live. What I loved was how amazingly simple, but complex the movie was and how we identify with and not feel sorry for them. This is, unfortunatly, one of Kurosawa's less-known works, but it should not be avoided."
3,Spode Blu Italian 3-Piece Tea Set,It is MADE IN CHINA. Looks good. Do not like the lid... they do not stay on if you're pouring the coffee out. Hold on to the lid!!!
5,They Loved It,"I actually purchased two of these Tea sets for some friends overseas. Upon delivery of the first one, the lady who wanted to give it as a gift loved it so much she asked me to get another as she was going to keep the first one for herself! Packaging and shipping were fantastic. Get's my 5 star."
4,Teacher's Puzzle Creator,"This is the perfect program to create puzzles for spelling and vocabulary. I am a former teacher who stays at home now. Spelling can be a hard thing to teach without just ""drill and kill."" Our major way to study was using flashcards and giving practice tests. This has opened a whole new way to help my daughters. They view it as a game. It is very easy to use. I have created Word searches and Crossword puzzles. You choose the size and shape. It works fantastic! I highly suggest any teachers looking for new idea should purchase this."
2,What was he thinking?,"This recording features marvelous players and a skilled chorus. But McCreesh's take on Messiah just seems weird. Maybe I'm too much a creature of habit. But having sung (chorus and soloist) and played (viola) in this work for 20+ years, I find myself flinching throughout. Not a jolt of recognition (wow, he's really found something wonderful there!) but of puzzlement (what is he doing?) Tempos seem either slow or fast; aspirated (ha-ha-ha) passages by soloists and choir are ugly (and given the latter's skill, I think unneeded). Like others, I would highly reccomend the Gardiner or Hogwood. Maybe I'll like this someday; but I doubt it."
4,Misses the mark-by a bit,"Maestro McCreesh's 1996 effort is a strong contender among the PI (period instrument) crowd. The orchestra doesn't screech, the chorus has weight, decent diction and color and the soloists have fine voices particularly the sopranos and the contralto.McCreesh appears to see the Messiah as drama or perhaps as opera. For example, contralto Bernarda Fink's desire for us feel her pain in ""He was despised..."" is over the top and distracting. The apparent intent of the players to strive for effect and to shade every word robs the performance of genuine sincerity-this is a work of spiritual expression after all. Nevertheless I enjoyed the performance for what it was and the interpretative approach will appeal to many."
2,not soft,"The item was going to be late to arrive, and customer service overnighted it so it would arrive for my trip. BUT. This item is crunchy sounding and not the soft item I have seen in stores, I can live with it but, it was supposed to be a gift for my husband and he hates it."
2,I doesn't fit,"I bought it for comfortable sleeping on airplane. However, this pillow is soft and it just lies on your shoulder. You neck has to bend so as to reach it. The other drawback is it occupies a lot of space in my bag.I will definitely buy a inflating pillow in the future."
2,"hot, sweaty neck","I didn't find this one to be very comforting during my travels to oversea. the pillow wraps around your neck and it made me get so hot and sweaty, I couldn't get any sleep during the 14 hour flight (I'm sure there were other factors involved in my insomnia).If you're looking for a travel pillow, perhaps a travel pillow made with more breathable, vented material would do a better job."
3,"good value, a little firm","I'd actually give this a 3.5 star if I could. The pillow itself was a good size and good value. It's filled with buckwheat husks I believe so it is a pretty firm pillow. I actually like firm pillows, but I would've preferred that it were a tad softer. Nevertheless, it worked well. It was a nice size.I wish it had a small snap button loop on one end (as is found on another travel pillow I have) so that I could attach it to my carry-on bag. Sometimes, the carry-on is just too full to stuff a pillow in and carrying by hand always leaves the chance of you leaving it behind. I found the little scent packet a little gimmicky."
4,One of the few times Mike didn't blow me away,"I am very happy that this lost gem, has finally been released since I am a HUGE J5/Michael Jackson fan. Musically very tight by '73 these boys pros at their craft. The only disappointment was my boy Michael. Michael Jackson without any question is top 5 greatest live performers of ALL-TIME!!! Everytime he's performed from age 8 to probably 35, he absolutely blew me away. This time because his voice was changing he couldn't hit the upper registers of the songs that he made just 3 years prior. Mike's adlibs are average (thats usually where he shines)and he is fighting the notes. I'm guessing as his voice is changing by the day Mike probably doesn't know what notes he can hit from one day to the next. Mike is professional, he sounds good but he wasn't his normal mind-blowing."
1,A disapointment for the Native American reader,"I have read many books about Native Americans and Prehistorical people. I thought this book was boring and I had difficulty finishing it. It was unrealistic to think a man from another area could come in and know more than the native people who lived in the swamp. I could not believe that the native people would allow their children to go and live with a crazy man in the swamp. Native Americans love and protect their children, and would never allow a man from another tribe to guide them in any way. Add the small girl into the island and it became to unrealistic to even enjoy."
2,HEY DRAKE GIMMIE A BREAK..,"although the game's cel shaded graphics and design is simular to the batman animated series, drakes does not exceed my expectations..the game seems too rushed and the levels can become frustrating and unispired.majesco was on a roll with gunmetal and bloodrayne the 2 hit sleepers of 2002. but drake is sorely lacking. for shooting action and better graphics/playability, choose gungrave instead.better luck next time guys"
1,One of the worst Video games ever created on a console,"Two words can describe this garbage.....it sucks..I won't even go to detail all I will say is not only is the gameplay glitched up and horrible to do especially how to controll drake, but the story is just plain stupid. Gamer no how doesn't know what he's talking aboutGameplay is just plain awfulMusic...............I'm not even gonna go thereThe controls is just plain awfulI have to give it a 1 out of 5...Hell I wish I could give it -5 stars but I can'tWHAT EVER YOU DO DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"
1,might be seizure inducing,"not just cause of the lights or the colors but how frustrating and brain epileptic teasing it is, it sounds like a hazard, shooting mechanic works with drake are horrible with him just moving his arms in the air like an idiot instead of using them right, and on top of that the story might seem to have some development but its nothing good its just stupid compared to like i dunno billions of other games out there that have better stories than this game ?."
3,A history of familial depression,"This story that documents a grandfather in depression, a distant strange father who eventually results in the family left behind is strange indeed. The book is quite short and does imply that that the father/priest lived a mentally troubled life leaving his family behind in the quest for his God. It is an interesting tale but short of an uplifting experience."
5,"The Father and the Son is a compelling, lively narrative.","The Father and the Son is a compelling, lively narrative that addresses universal issues of faith, self-discovery, and parent-child relationships. Through Murray's eyes, we see his father's journey from being a husband, father, and civil servant to becoming a monk and a priest. More important, we come to understand that transformation. Murray describes his reaction to that journey with humor, warmth, and, at times, a reporter's skepticism."
4,A moving account of an everyday family dealing with change,"I am an agnostic and usually don't have much patience for books about religion/faith. But Matt's book was wry, sad and well researched, making it a compelling read. The chapters about his mother were moving and honest. Actually honesty about memories that at times must have been painful is one of the most redeeming qualities of this book. I would strongly recommend this book as a vivid recollection/recreation of the changes that could happen in any American family.And in the interest of full disclosure I have known the author for about six years. He is a colleague at The Wall Street Journal and a very good friend."
4,The Father and the Son written by the youngest son.,"This must have been a difficult book for Matt Murray to undertake and complete; nonetheless, I think he did a great job. The book appeared to be an honest account and was well-written, as well. Everyone has a story and Matt Murray told us about his Dad's rare journey. I'm glad that I read this compellingly-written book."
2,A disappointment,"The premise behind Murray's book is certainly a fascinating one. The problem I had is that he never bothers to dig very far into the psychology of the father, never offers us more than a hazy, opaque figure at the center of the story. The father's thoughts, feeling and motivations remain unexplored, as if the author were reluctant to poke around too much into the man's private world. He thus remains more an archetype than a fully rounded human being. I'm afraid I have to agree with the Boston Globe, which said of the book: ""It's an awkward story, awkwardly told. Not only do the multiple viewpoints pose a problem, but so does Murray's palpable unease with the subject, and a cliche-soaked style that frequently plummets into bathos and self-dramatizing."""
4,"""Painters Painting"" of cosmology","Aspiring astronomers should see this. This is the ""Painters Painting"" of cosmology. My only complaint is that many interesting conversations between experts are over dubbed with narration. This is a slice of life of astronomers."
5,Comical Christmas carols from Star Wars Universe.,"The voice of Anthony Daniels and the bleeps and howls of R2 and Chewie form a wonderful Christmas album. Comical numbers such as What Do You Get A Wookie For Christmas If He Already Owns A Comb?( Love, understanding, and a brush) are a riot. Good numbers such as Bells, Bells, Bells and Sleigh Ride fill the rest of this CD reintroduced after being a record released after the Star Wars Holiday Special on TV in 1978. Also, Jon Bon Jovi makes his debut in R2D2 We Wish You A Merry Christmas before he signed a record contract. The only drawback is Anthony Daniels doesn't sound like he did in the movies. To sum it up, this is a must for Star Wars lovers! - Garrett END"
5,The reason I wake up in the morning,"I personally love ""Christmas in the Stars"". I am an 18 year old currently studying dramatic writing at one of the most prestigious universities in the world and I can honestly say that this album has helped me get through all of the rigors of college. I listen to this album while writing, walking, doing laundry, eating, showering, etc. I highly recommend ""Christmas in the Stars"" to any star wars enthusiast, children over the age of seven, your aunt, grandfather, and homeless drunk who has currently found temporary shelter on the corner from your house. I LOVE CHRISTMAS IN THE STARS!!!!!!!"
1,This is Lame,"Compared to the other Star Wars CD's, this was a huge disappointment. This is a disgrace to the Star Wars legacy. I am shocked and appalled that everyone here gave it five stars. Forget it, I just can't go on without seriously offending anyone."
5,The Best!,"This album is wonderful! I know the people who did background vocals. The music is fun, a great family album!"
1,big dissapointment,"I bought this album thinking hey maybe it will be kind of like jingle bells johm williams style, but instead it turned out to be a bunch of terrible 60's recordings by morons. Buy a different album if your a star wars fan. It's not worth it, at all."
1,a little disappointing,unfortunatly it wasn't the Quality of music I was expectingnot bad as a joke cd but bad for Star Wars
1,you won't believe this...,"But it's true-- bon jovi is the vocalist on this--- check it out on allmusic.com. now if that doesn't tell you how bad this is, nothing will. PLEASE keep this out of stock AND out of print."
4,Wonderful Christmas Silliness,"If you like the silly songs of Christmas (Grandma got run over by a reindeer, I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus, etc.) and you are a Star Wars fan, you'll love this. I've had the cassette for years and it's now a MUST at Christmas. I'm getting the CD now so I can have it in perpetuity."
5,"Great for children of all ages. If you have kids, buy it.","As a music educator and composer it upsets me when critics judge a work on criteria it was not composed to meet. This CD is great! It starts with the fast paced ""Christmas In The Stars"", frolicks through several fun numbers in the middle and ends with the climactic song ""The Meaning of Christmas"" starring characters all kids from 1977 to the present will be familiar with. If you have kids who like Star Wars or if you feel you are still a kid that likes Star Wars, this CD is a must, not because it has some characters from the Star Wars movies, but because it is fun, innocent and has some good messages. WK"
1,I got my copy autographed by Anthony Daniels!,"This album's story line takes place in a droid factory where the robots make toys year-round for S. Claus. But they don't quite know what to make of Christmas until the comedy duo of droids, C-3PO and R2-D2, helps explain it all. To call this album bad would be an understatement. I realize that this is a children's album, but I can't imagine that too many children would enjoy this insipid junk. The lyrics are especially awful. When I met Anthony Daniels, he called this album ""pure crap"". Take it from C-3PO himself, folks."
1,Don't order thinking its a 2lbs pack?!,"Shipped item was only 1 pound not 2 like amazon has on the page!!!! Bon tool is a tool and will not help you, your on your ow. GOOD LUCK!!!"
2,"Book superb, but kindle edition NOT",I had the printed version of this book with me and wanted the kindle version to make it simpler for me to refer and take notes. The major problem I found was that there were a lot of language mistakes in the kindle version. Words appear misspelled or broken up. Arabic rendering of SAW('all All'hu 'alay-hi wa-sallam) appears broken and in gibberish etc...So the enjoyment of reading a really good book is messed up on Kindle due to the bogus proof-reading or editing done.
2,Couldn't finish it,"I don't know what all the fuss is about. Ive heard people raving about this book. I wasn't able to finish it. It seems like it's been translated. For me that gives it a very stern feeling. It is extremely textbook-like, but as far as that goes - the textbook we had back in school was more detailed. For such a poetic title, I thought it would be written in a very sensitive, moving way and would be a lot more engaging than it was.If thats all I want, a serious, dry account - then I might as well get a book that's at least rich in details. It was 'A Short History of Islam.' Unfortunately I don't remember who the author was."
1,Opposite of Robert Spencer,"Now if Robert Spencer on the one hand paints Mohammed as a thug, this book on the other hand makes him walk on water.Avoid reading completely biased biographies either too-Muslim or anti-Muslim.To read a balanced biography read Karen Armstrong or Martin Lings or even Tariq Ramadan."
3,"Somewhat outdated book, but an interesting concept","I bought this book because I really do need to relax, but I found that the recommended methods for relaxation are just too complex and time consuming to be practical for me. I wouldn't recommend this book for someone with limited time or patience to try it because you would need over an hour of uninterrupted time to hold still and not focus on relaxing each day. It's a bit confusing to me as well. Maybe if you could do this under the supervision of a practitioner it would work, but the 5th edition of the book came out in 1978. I doubt you could find someone familiar enough with it."
2,"Livemotion is no FLASH, it's just a slower Imagestyler.","Livemotion was created from the ImageStyler product of Adobe. I am Imagestyler user and was impressed by its functionality and ease of use. Imagestyler 1.0 is a great product especially for web designers who would like pixel-point accuracy and flexible layouting tool.But it has some limitations though which I expected to have been addressed into Livemotion. Instead Adobe put animation features into Livemotion to rival that of Flash.When I evaluated Livemotion, these are what I found out: 1. Livemotion could not rival Flash in terms of animation and it will probably take 2 or more releases before it can be at par with Flash. 2. Livemotion is no better than Imagestyler instead its even slower.So what Adobe did is they dropped the Imagestyler which is a good product on its own and now they try to compete with Flash with Livemotion but its is no contest. So Adobe, please give us Imagestyler 2.0."
3,Great Animation - Can't Export to any AVI files,The money you pay is just not worth it. I'am not able to export it to my video editing programs. Great in creating effects for your Web Site - but with the money you pay I just think that Adobe should've allowed to export into other media.Not worth it - unless you only intend to export to Web Pages...
3,New York theaters 1873-1932,"William Morrison's book covers 74 theaters from 1873 to 1932, including those demolished as well as those still standing. Most theaters get two pages of coverage, consisting mostly of b&w photos of both the exterior and interior. The accompanying text emphasizes noteworthy performances. This book is a nice overview of the topic, although I preferred van Hoogstraten's ""Lost Broadway Theaters,"" which gives more information about the interior layouts, but doesn't cover theaters that are still standing."
4,Good Food for Rats,"My rats really love this food. The only problem is, they pick and choose what they want to eat. They would get a more balanced diet from a pellet form of food. They do eat most the food and like the dental crunch pieces. It is a little messy because it is seed based and the shells end up all over the bottom of the cage. We no longer use this food because of the lack of balance when the rats chose only their favorite parts."
3,Entertaining but instrumental is shadowed by vocal,The vocals are well expressed in this cd. But unfortunatly it masks out the instruments and if a chorus is singing the womans part is sometimes hard to catch. Some songs dragged like Scandal and Outrage. I feel personally denied that the dream music is not included. The best part of the cd is the expression of the actors in the music (except Alle Hackem). I personally wish I had bought a more modern recording of Oklahoma. This one is decent though.
2,"Great Musical, Dated Recording","This original production made history, no argument, but due to the restrictive recording techniques of the day, the album is showing its age. While the stars were remarkable, Alfred Drake, Joan Roberts, the great Celeste Holm, and Howard DeSilva, the recording doesn't do their performances or the groundbreaking score justice. For the best recording and to hear how the score should actually sound get the revival from 1979 with Laurence Guittard, Christine Andreas, the delicous Christine Ebersole, and the definitive Jud Fry of Martin Vidnovic. Not to take anything away from the original, but the recording of this revival is so far superior technically to the original. The reason revivals are so wonderful and vital, it gives theater lovers the oppurtunity to obtain recordings of shows with completeness and audio quality unavailable years ago."
3,Oklahoma in 1943,Since this was done later than most original cast recordings is seemed to lack the enthusiasm we have come to expect from recordings of this type.
2,Probably not the one you're looking for,I thought I was buying the film soundtrack and it turns out it's just a subset of the tracks.This is the one you're probably looking for:Oklahoma! (1955 Film Soundtrack)
1,Bad bad bad,I just wouldn't recommend this book. I don't even remember why I bought it. Maybe I was in a trance.
2,Wow. That just wasn't good,"I was looking forward to reading this book after hearing a few good reviews about it and liking the premise. I was sorely disappointed. I felt like i was reading the rough draft of a novel, not the finished piece. It was in desperate need of editing, reworking of action scenes, and better explanation of the mildly ridiculous magic system. I was bored the entire time. But it did have some witty dialogue at times and it never took itself too seriously (definitely a good thing!). Maybe the next one will be better..."
3,Disappointing,"So many good ideas!!! And yet, so little development. It almost seems like the author was racing to meet a deadline. Details are wrong (Red Guard are from China, not Iraq), the timeline is screwy (I couldn't figure out if it was day or night and a week went by with no sense of development), and there are at least 3 'first' chapters (the opening paragraphs read like the first chapter of the book). This could have been drawn out into three books worth of mystery and magic. Instead, it was slapped together like a meal at an expensive restaurant that will close a month after it opens in New York because the chef is a great cook but a bad manager."
5,Little known but deserves to be read,I think this one dates from 1973. It is a very good crime story. It has always been obscure and difficult to find but deserves more light of day. I couldn't put this down when I read it. Recommended!
4,remarkable first person account,"This is a remarkable and well-written first person account of a young woman's detention and imprisonment, arrested in East Berlin in 1950, accused as an American spy and sent to prison camp in Russia after World War II. It is an intriguing story of her personal ordeal over five long years, caught up in the sometimes faceless and inhumane global political conflicts of a dramatic time in world history, early in the Cold War era, and at the height of America's anti-communist McCarthy terrorism. Erica Wallach's vivid memories of her long ordeal provide a compelling portrayal of a critical period in the formation of America's current international political position, and of a very intimate battle for survival and personal integrity. This is a book worthy of study by serious historians of the period as well as for the interest of its intended audience, namely the concerned and interested American citizen."
4,little jimmy is a whoopie I enjoyed,"i enjoyed all of the songs on this cd. most were popular in the 60's, some i had never heard before. if you like old hillbilly, whoopie style you'll like this cd"
5,A Nice Touch For any Fan,"Good quality pin for hats, lapels, backpacks and more! Great quality at a great price! Colors and details are very nice on this pin!"
2,Very Laborious Read,"This book was a laborious read. It was a century ago and the writing style is archaic and the formal logic in the arguments is flawed. I found it difficult and tedious and would not recommend it unless it is required reading for a class, as this was."
3,Not flexible enough to fit my head.,This wig is not for adult size heads. I would have liked it if it was bit bigger but was uncomfortable for my head. And I do not have a large head.
5,I just started in the entertainment business & don't have too much $$$ so this Wig is perfect for my budget!!!,Excellent Wig for the price.. I love it and I get a lot of complements. I used it 5 times already and still looks beautifull!!! Definatelly will buy it again :)
5,One Flew Over the Cucckoo's Nest collector's Blu-ray,so my god you must see this film .. very nuts hahaha great transfer picture to high defintion with big aspek ration 5/5 and average audio or good for drama movie 4/5 and great feature 4/5 and a lot of git edition 5/5. i buy from Amazon with a great deal prices.
1,go for the 3-8,"Even though we tried to keep it away from her, my beagle puppy chewed up the cord pretty fast. So we got the 3-8 as a replacement, and the all-belt design has held up much better."
1,It worked great the first week...,"When I first bought this leash, I couldn't have been happier. My dog could run all over and the leash would never get caught in her legs. I could let her have 5 feet or 25 feet. It's like she wasn't even on a leash. That all changed in the second week when the cord stopped retracting. Now I have 20 feet of cord laying on the ground and getting caught between her legs.Do yourself a favor and find another brand."
3,Something lacking,"To me, most of Hemmingway does not translate well to movies and this was no exception. It seemed to lag and was a bit confusing until the end."
4,DECEITFUL,OK. OOOOPS! MY ERROR. I. didn't look close enough at the small print. This indeed is Burt Lancaster's first film. If anyone looked at my first review. please ignore.
1,not worth the hassle,This program takes several steps to do something that should only take one. It's cumbersome and illogical. eClass Grades is much easier to use.
1,Teacher's Toolbox 4.0,Do not waste your money. The program is not user friendly and does not offer anything I can't find on any other program.
3,mirror works,This mirror is about what I expected for the price. What I didn't expect was that once installed on the wall it was tweaked and wouldn't lock to the magnet closure. But for the price I guess it is worth it.
1,Not for chewing dogs.,"I gave my wire hair terrier the ""Man Best Friend"", came back 5 to 6 minutes later with my coat on to go outside and play, and he had the stuffing out of it already. Threw away. Only for throwing and retreiving and then take away from dog immediately. Not worth it."
5,Very nice weight set,"Perfect started weight set for a home gym. The weights look and feel like professional ones that you would find at a gym. The stand is also the perfect size and easy to put together. They do have a little bit of a funny smell for a couple of days though as the rubber off gasses, but that goes away."
5,same problems as everyone else but a good item none the less,"I checked the prices at 6 different stores and the price for the dumbbells alone was $4 more than I paid here for the dumbbells and the rack. I plan on getting the 30 and 35 pound dumbbells at the store with the best price.Even after all the reviews here, they still ship with no instructions and in a box that disintegrates during shipping. My square box was actually completely wrapped in packing tape and then put into another big brown box during shipment. I'm surprised they arrived safely."
4,Good cookbook for the Lewis and Clark Lover,This cook book is a great gift idea for people who love reading about Lewis & Clark. The only downfall I've found is some of the recipes may not be general supermarket friendly.
4,"Nothin' fancy, just a blade","Was well satisfied with this purchase.Exactly what I was looking for when ours broke.Didn't know if I could find a part for a 14 year-old food processor, but there it was.A MINOR hiccup with getting it shipped, but after I contact the company, I had it in just a few days.Satisfied customer!"
1,Doesn't Fit!,"This items looks like my old blade, but doesn't fit my machine. It also looks 'used'. The blade is scratched and dirty looking. I am very upset with this purchase and even more upset that I now have to pay return shipping. Waste of money!"
4,It brings back my childhood christmas memories,"My parents had this album as I was growing up. My sister and I have been listening to a recording of it that my father taped for us years ago. I have been looking for this is CD format, since CD's came out. This album is all about Christmas. Adults having fun and acting like children again! It's a true sing-along."
5,What Fun!,"What a fun and merry Christmas tape. All the traditional songs (with some twists) and some very fun songs for the kids. My favorite, ""Angel in the Christmas Play,"" reminds me of my childhood and our Christmas programs. Buy it...Christmas music should be this fun!"
4,Gift for Grandson,"I bought this CD for my 6-year-old grandson because he just lost his two front teeth. I thought it would be fun for him to hear this song, and I My grandson loved it! He had never heard of the song before, and had to play it for his mom. He also likes ""I'm Getting Nuttin"" for Christmas."" We all keep telling him to be good or Santa will not bring him anything. His eyes popped when he heard this song, and he laughed at all the bad things the child did in the song. Again, I think the Spike Jones versions are the best. They are full of fun, noisy sound effects and things that appeal to kids. It's a great recording, and I'm glad I found it at a reasonable price."
3,Not your average Spike CD!,"This CD was a surprise to me. Spike Jones shows in this that he has a serious side in most of these songs and only goes ""crazy"" with the songs sung by George ""Georgie"" Rock. ""All I want..2 teeth"" is good but the original version from the 40s is much more spontaneous and fun. ""I'm the Angel in the Christmas play"" and ""My Birthday Comes on Christmas"" are both very cute and worth the price of the CD. Also a pig-latin version of Jingle Bells is very Spike-ish! In the end though, Spike gives a good balance of crazyness and religiousness."
5,Great Classic Holiday CD,"This CD is not just the crazy Spikes songs, but a great eclectic holiday mix. If you like a vintage or retro sound, then you'll love this!"
4,What is the making of a genius?,"Inspired by Paul Gauguin's life, this novel shows the reader the life of a man (Strickland) who's possessed by producing art. Late in his life he changes his normal life into an extraordinary, bohemian life and thus he leaves his wife and his two children to fulfil his life aim to become a painter. For that he moves to France and later on to Tahiti, where he suffers from poverty and eventual illness. Strickland is an extremely single-minded person even though he marries his second wife, who of course does everything for him and loves him dearly. In Tahiti he lives the last few years of his life, blind but still producing great works of art. Strickland just had the soul of a genius."
2,I'd suggest cakes and ale,"This is very far from Maugham's best (to me, his short stories and novellas). The character, Strickland, genius painter perhaps based on Gauguin, is just not believable. Real great artists (such as Gauguin) may be odd in their personal lives, but they do spend time with other artists, they do discuss art; they don't seem to be the ignorant brutes this fellow is. The book feeds off a popular idea of the artist as outsider, and certainly there have been many who were. Yet even Van Gogh, exemplary nutter genius, talked to other painters, including Gauguin. Strickland's art comes out of a personal vacuum, which seems unrealistic.So unlikely is the main character that before the book ended I lost interest and stopped reading. For a better book by Maugham on the unexpected personal life of great artists, read Cakes and Ale instead."
3,A sociopath with talent is still a sociopath.,"This was my first attempt at reading W. Somerset Maugham. The man can definitely write. But the story told here is somber. A writer becomes fascinated with a man who gave up everything in order to become an artist. This artist is a brute of a man whom we today might call a sociopath. He cares nothing for the feelings of others. In fact, he is so unlikeable, that it was hard for me to finish reading this book. I don't buy into the theory that ""genius"" is an excuse for appalling behavior. This book left me depressed. I don't think I will be reading any more novels by Maugham."
3,The Moon and Sixpence,"(side note - i actually was interested in reading this book after reading bag of bones by stephen king. in that book the main character mentions that this book was a favorite of both he and his wife's and that led me to amazon and do i really need to explain further?) i would probably give this a 3.5. the first couple of chapters were a bit tedious to get through but sticking to it i found the rest of the book to be interesting enough. i don't know if or who i would recommend it to, i think you'd need to be in a certain frame of mind to read this book, which i just happened to be this weekend. i can't really explain it any better than that. overall as i said it was an interesting read and i'm not sorry that i finally bought and read it though i'm not sure it's one that i'll ever read again either."
3,"Good point, horribly bland execution....","What makes the book so unbearably boring is precisely its insight: In the recesses of Strickland (a stand-in for Paul Gauguin), far beneath his brutish public trace and gamut of personae, far beneath anything observable, lies an artistic genius that, for most of the characters, isn't even manifest in the artist's work. How's that? It's hard to tell whether Maugham is circuitously disdaining the posthumous and arbitrary obsession we all have with artists or with boyish persistence reaching for that which, though veritable, none of us are great enough to discern and appreciate, a kind of absurd communion with inspiration that necessarily morally outcasts the inspired. Either way, even when Strickland is biographically tethered to history, it's hard to find him compelling, as a man (or madman) or symbol."
4,Follow your way!,"The main character is Charles Strickland, a successful stockbroker. He gives up everything to follow his own vocation. He's obsessed by the passion to create beauty. Even though you don't know much about his daily life you get involved in the spirit of art and the way artists live and think. The last part of the book when Strickland's life in Thahiti is narrated by people who got in touch with him there. There you learn most about his character and you understand his feelings better.Somerset Maugham was inspired by the life of Paul Gauguin when he wrote this book. But it's not a boring biography which contains each detail of Paul Gauguin's life, a lot of the events in the book didn't happen in his real life at all. I really enjoyed reading this book and Ican recommend to read it to everyone."
5,On par with 'Of Human Bondage',"One of his best works. Maugham uses the first person to tell this tale (as he does with most of his other stories) and there is a sense that most if not all of his writings contain many autobiographical parts. This book is one of them. It is the story of how the life of the writer and that of a painter criss-cross until the death of the artist. The artist is based on the life of Paul Gauguin (the painters name is different in the book, but the similarities are too compelling). If you enjoy 19th century art history, you must read this book!"
4,Great read,"For fans of Maughum's work, this book does not vere too far from the style and substance of his others. As always, he writes in a tight and lucid manner that suggests more of a conversation with an old--albeit very ""old World"" proper--friend. There's no rocket launches, or car crashes, or DNA mutations...simply a well written tale which, as an added bonus, provides for the reader a glimpse of an era gone-bye."
3,"Well written, but flat out depressing","Not a book I would recommend. As far as literature goes, I guess it is ok, but the subject matter is frustrating from beginning to end. Nice guys finish last kind of plot. In other words, beat your girlfriend and have no compassion, and your girl will love you till you die and everyone else will treat you like a god. (I am a nice guy, so that is why it irks me so much.) By the end, I just wanted to take a gun and put it to my head. It just struck me on a personal level. (Keeping in mind the year in which it was written helped a bit.) Reading it on the Kindle Paperwhite was fantastic, however."
5,I think of this book all the time,"The subject was of utmost interest, a selfish man who is thoroughly and well portrayed in this biopic of a novel. I will re-read it one of these days. One of Maugham's best for sure and haunting in that you remember it when you see a Gaughan hanging in the museum."
4,Follow your path!,"I had to read this book in school and I was really positivly surprised. Maugham tells the story of anbusiness and family man called Strickland who is obsessed by art and who decides to become a painter. Maugham tells this story in a very interesting way and you can read it almost in a day. Personallly I like the beginning and the end most. There you get a good view of the different persons and characters and he tries to explain what art can do. In the middle is a long stretch of narration where Strickland lives in Paris, which is really too long and I wonder why Maugham did it because you don't really get much insight into Strickland's character at all. The end of the novel is very well written. Maugham tells the story indirectly by introducing a narrator who interviews various people who met Strickland during his life in Tahiti. I can recommend this book to everyone that likes fluent language and an interesting plot."
5,Brilliant tale of a misunderstood genius,"This book is incredible. Maugham's delicious descriptive sense and writing ability are a delight. For anyone who feels like no one understands them (and don't we all?) will enjoy this urge. It will also give all readers an overwhelming urge to create somethig with passion. I suggest you read it and decide for yourself, but you will not be dissapointed."
2,Counterpoint,"OK, so the author's storytelling talent is great, he told a counterintuitive story and Paul Gauguin's works continue to inspire a broad swath of humanity a century later .... The novel is not that interesting. The artist is an ass. He cares for nothing. Even his commitment to art, beauty and truth is nothing more than an obsession. The obsession is not well described. The third party commentator approach becomes boring. The characterization of four potentially inspiring locations is weak, almost bleached out. There may have been a time when the artist's courage to provide a countervailing perspective, running against the inertia of the culture, was a heroic act, worthy of praise. Today it seems pedestrian, self-serving, even formulaic. I appreciate many of Maugham's other works, but this one fell flat."
4,2 thumbs up!,"I really enjoyed this book.It stands out in my memory.Some classic books can be boring, but not this one! What is amazing to me is that I actually felt some sympathy for Charles despite his immense selfishness. People should not overlook this book."
5,Wonderful classic,"Maugham gives a subtle, believable portrait of a man driven by his need for artistic creation, a person very unlike ordinary human beings. There is nothing like reading a famous old writer -- the language, the diction, the story development! It was a pleasure to read. Plus, in this case I presume, I learned something about Paul Gauguin."
4,A good read about a radical artist,An interesting story about an author who follows the mysterious trail of a successful businessman and husband of a socialite that forfeits it all to follow his dream to paint.
4,Great to a point.,"Nice book, though it wanders away the last 40 pages. Not at the level of the brilliant ""Of Human Bondage."""
2,no good,"no good, its all in black and white. I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing.The first volume, revelations was beutiful glossy color. I'm wondering if there is another issue with the same cover in color beacuse on the amazon ""look inside"" it is in color."
5,Portfolio Saver,I had to do a 100 page portfolio project in this book saved my life. It was easy to read and follow. The pictures were amazing and I loved the book. It was filled with so much information about our history and the history of art.
4,Not the right picture!!,"Amazon has the wrong picture posted for this item. The picture shows a case with a telescoping handle and wheels so that you can pull it behind you like luggage. This is the case that we WANTED to purchase. Unfortunately, the case we received did not have the telescoping handle or the wheels. The item # for that case is 1510, not 1500. This is very frustrating, not only for the consumer but also for the merchant. The merchant in this case told me that they do not have control over the picture that Amazon puts with the description. They did give me a $15 credit but would not trade out the product we received with the product that we actually wanted and THOUGHT that we had ordered without wanting to charge me the difference."
3,Dissolvd too quickly,I like the flavor and ingredients but wish the mints would hang out in my mouth a lot longer without dissolving so quickly.
2,Very soft,Richochet mints are so soft you just eat them. They are not to be sucked. I don't like the softness.
2,"lies, all lies",The package makes it seem like these are typical peppermint hard candies (with Xylitol). They're not. They actually look like aspirin tablets and dissolve in about three seconds. They're not what I thought I was buying.The flavor's ok --just ok. It's hard to say for sure when it's gone before you know it.
5,Great!,"Simple, natural ingredients. Great flavor. Great product. Plan to buy again. . . . . . . . . ."
4,Good for you mints,Our dentist reccomended that we start on mints with Xyletol in them and these mints fit the bill. They have a nice taste and studies have showen Xyletol can help your teeth.
1,NOT Star Mints!,I based my purchase on the package picture. Boy was I disappointed! The product is very strong and induced instant heartburn. There were also many broken pieces in the box that I opened. I am going to ask for a refund even though the product is non returnable.These may be right for you if you like powerfully strong mints.
4,Refreshing with xylitol,"These mints are different from the other xylitol mints to which I had grown accustomed. They have a great fresh, cool, minty effect--typical of xylitol--and are very good. The main drawback is that they can dissolve very quickly vs. some of the harder mints I have had, which is the only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars."
1,Research FIRST,"First time users need to check out side affects of Xylitol before investing in it. It can cause gastro-intestinal ""disturbance"" that is not very pleasant. I now have almost 600 mints to put in the trash."
5,Cute!,"I purchased this item for the offic gift exchange. The golfers went crazy for it. We have the kind of exchange where you can ""steal"" someone else's gift and this bbq set really made the rounds! Nice quality and is bigger than it looks in the picture."
1,Previously Used Set,I ordered this purchase as a *new* item and when i received it it looked scratched and used. I had planned on giving it as a gift but given the condition of the set I was very disappointed as I could not give it to anyone (other than my college age brother)!!!
3,Raw,"Gill-Branion is a writer, there's no doubt about that, but he's also an Author in need of some guidance with the craft. With a little tutoring from an experienced and successful science fiction Author this young man could go on to write extraordinary masterpieces of fiction. The rawly talented way he speeds you through a story packed with creatures and planets is astounding. The emotion of the characters literally jumps off the page at you. However, errors in the print and editing take away from a cleverly written play/story-style that Gill-Branion has ear-marked as his own."
5,On The Front Line.,"Gill-Branion places women on the Front and in Leadership positions in this sci-fi thriller. He makes it seem logical for us to be there and we are strong, we are invincible, we are humanity's last HOPE. Hurray! The story is great and people who have preconceptions and prejudices may find it difficult to read. Take your time because an abundance of information is thrown at you in a short period of time with a wild pace. The Amanda & Tiffany sex scene is to die for!-Raven"
5,Move Over Star Wars!,"Splendid! Unlike Lucas, Gill-Branion is able to keep one enthralled the whole trip across the Galaxy and his characters aren't weak and innocent trying to develop strength and courage along the way. They are seasoned from beginning to end! A very moving story which has you siding with the enemy of humanity, especially after 9/11/2001. Brilliantly written! I hope more close minded people here in Missouri read it.Tori"
4,An Unusual Writer-Great Up and Comer!,"This writer is a personal friend of mine, so when he told me his book was finished i could not wait to read it. Suffice it to say i have not been disappointed so far- i am only on the first chapter and i usually know by then if a book is worth my time.This is worth it, the characters are well developed, the storyline is impressive and the books premise is quite astounding. Finally this book gives the genre of science fiction a much needed boost. Well Done!"
5,Well! Well!,"It's very different and refreshingly so! It reads as a book or play, but I wonder how difficult it would be to try and perform onstage. It has it all; steamy sex scenes, gender preference/difference, Politics vs. Ethics, The Blame Game, Right vs. Wrong, Good vs. Evil...etc.Aliens respectfully sentient, Humanity guilty of ignorance, Starships and Sunskip, oh my! It's enjoyable and I became especially fond of Tiffany in the story. Women will love the ending."
4,Guts!,"It takes guts to write a sci-fi book with the sole purpose of turning it into a movie. Obviously, this is what GillBranion has done and you can tell because it's written as a screenplay when the characters in the story talk. It's very confusing at times to say the least.I liked the story because it's an actors dream! Every character part would be important (would actually mean something) and you would have a lot of lines. :-)I live in Hollywood and this unusual little book is becoming an underground cult classic among my clan of unemployed actors.It's not cheap, but interesting. If you're an actor you'll like the lines in it. If you're not you'll probably like the sex..."
3,Not sure what I think.,"We used this on our dog, who had a really nasty abscess on his neck. I'm a RN so I'm well versed in wound care and figured I could translate that to taking care of our dog's wound. We did have it lanced at the vet and he was on antibiotics for a week, so I ordered this just as a supplement to help with healing because we didn't have the money to have the abcess surgically removed just yet. Despite daily dressing changes with irrigation, packing with sterile gauze soaked in this, his abcess just got progressively worse. We had to have it removed before we were financially able to afford it because it had gotten so bad.I was hoping this would have helped it to heal up, but who knows, maybe the abcess was just too deep for this to do the trick. We still have about 75% of the tub left so maybe I'll give it another chance when the need arises since so many others swear by it."
5,Old fashioned drawing salve in a huge container,"When I was growing up in the 60s and 70s, our family always had ichthammol in the medicine cabinet. My most vivid memory of it was the time I got a staff infection and boil from shaving under my arms. My mother spread ichthammol on it and covered it with a bandage, and in a day or two it had opened and drained. She also used it on a deep splinter my father had, and in a day or two it had drawn out the splinter and all the infection.This is the same tar-like goop I remember from my childhood, in a very large container. It's labeled for veterinary use, but like many veterinary products, it's fine for humans too. Be sure to cover whatever you use it on with a bandage because it will stain clothing and bedding.There's a reason why these old remedies are still around today - they work!"
2,Ambiguous Product Description,"The Duvet cover comes with too much lint. To top it off, the product description mentions pillowcases as part of the package, but promptly fails to arrive. This repeated with the replacement too!The material is pretty nice I think except for the lint. Maybe after a few washes it will settle down.Amazon customer service requested me to return the item and were pretty nice and apologetic about it. I feel that they did a good job so far."
1,Very displeased with this water heater!,"We are very displeased with this water heater. Often when we have a windy day, maybe twice a month on average, the wind BLOWS OUT the pilot light. There is no pilot adjustment screw on the pilot. We have spent hours trying to figure out how to increase the pilot flame size to no avail.We have read all the documentation that came with the unit and all the Bosch documentation online. For some reason Bosch documention is very careful to not discuss this issue. They keep refering to: ""call your local service representative""! We do not want to pay for a service call for something as simple as adjusting the flame size of the pilot!Often the pilot will blow out at night leaving us with out hot water for our morning showers!!!"
4,Suicide in a children's book?,"A good book... but is it for children? It is,if your child won't understand the reference tosuicide. But would you risk that? What is suicide doing in a children's book? Of course,Defoe's Robinson Carouso contains references tocannibalism, The Giver contains infanticide, etc.So consider this before selecting it for yourchild. Otherwise, it's on a philosophical parwith The Prophet... but will children be able tounderstand it?"
2,"Cute cover picture, but not a little kids book","My 3 and 4 year old just tuned this out. I thought it was a kids book, I'm 1/3 the way through, seems like some artsy thing that probably has deep social connotations or some fancy irony. It's silly and frivolous so far. I want to say lame, but I haven't finished it yet. I hope it will have some redeeming value on the last 2/3 of the book. I wish I had bought it used."
5,Great Book!!!!,"Excellent book. I ordered for my daughter, because I read it when I was a little girl and it became one of my favorite books until today!!! She loved it!!"
5,The one to have,I recently purchased a copy of this beloved little book for a friend but it was not translated by Ms. Woods. The version I bought doesn't say who did the translation. I was printed in India in 2007. It doesn't have the same quality illustrations and the translation lacks some of the emotional power of the Woods interpretation of the book. I recommend you find the version that has Katharine Woods name on the cover. The new book is cheaper but it is NOT as good as her version. Eventually I paid three times as much for a used copy of her translation but I think it was worth it. Yes it is that much better.
4,Helping survivors find closure,Follows the activities of the organization trying to identify buried remains of murdered family members. Interesting how they try to identify those found.
4,Amazing true story from history that could be today's news.,"I had the very good fortune to read this book when it was in Galleys, and it is wonderful. It's one of the earliest books written in the USA, and was written by a woman. Set in Fall River, Massachussetts in the 18th century, it tells the tale of a young girl who is seduced, impregnated, and then abandoned and defamed by an scoundrel of a minister. What was truely striking (apart from the quality of the writing), was how little things had changed in the intervening period. As I was reading the galleys, a very similar case was being tried in the same area. Well worth reading, not only for its style, but also for its content, and for its depiction of life in New England in that time."
5,Outstanding Musical Compositions,"The rhythmic sounds of ""Are You Going With Me"" has made this album a timeless collection piece for any serious progressive jazz fan. Metheny has broken through with rich sounding orchestrations complemented by the keyboard brilliance of Lyle Mays. A must for your collection!"
4,My Metheney Group's version of Pink Floyd,This album is one of those private pieces to listen to. There is music to listen to with the rest of the world and this is in fact the opposite. Head collecting and reflecting mark this one as unique.........
1,OH SO BORING!!!!,"I find this album, cd or whatever you want to call it pretty boring. I mean Metheny is obviously a master, but if your expecting anything comparable to bright size life you'll be disappointed. Imagine Kenny G with a guitar synth and some cool wind noises behind it. I'm sorry if I just don't get it, but I don't."
3,Is it Metheny or is it Mays?,"Sorry. I realize that jazz pundits consider this to be one of Metheny's landmark albums. It certainly was the beginning of Pat's latin period in 1982. However, I honestly can't tell most the time if I'm listening to Metheny's Roland GR-300 guitar synthesizer, or if I'm listening to Lyle Mays' Oberheim synthesizer. This album sounds like two ""Dueling Synthesizers"" going back and forth to me. Now you might like that sound and that's just fine. But to my mind, the classic Pat Metheny sound we all know and love is his good ole' Gibson ES-175 jazz guitar that he used in the late 1970's."
4,Soaring side streets,"Too short it may be, but rest assured Metheny makes this brief detour completely worth getting lost in."
4,Slightly Outdated but Good,"This book has reasonable approximations of Russian pronunciation, and lots of grammar, but some of the words are slightly dated. Most of the names of cities are the USSR versions, not the Russian (i.e. Leningrad, not St. Petersburg). Otherwise, though, the examples are good and the exercises can be interesting. I'd recommend it for basic vocabulary and grammar, and a good Russian-English dictionary for more modern words."
4,"Good Read for Parents, Not Neurologists","This was a good read for parents of teens or pre-adolescents who are not in the medical field or some related field. The author is not a researcher but a journalist putting together what they've learned about the topic. (Some parents may have already done this for themselves.) It's not as detailed as someone well-read on the topic may hope, but for someone just becoming interested, perhaps someone experiencing shocking episodes in their own home with their own primal teen, it's a good starter book! Glad she put it together. Hopefully there's more to come with more neurological detail."
1,"Terribly, Terribly, Terrible","Terribly, Terribly, terrible book. The characters are so broadly drawn, it read more like an outline for a book or a manuscript , not a finished piece of work. It touches on so many themes and characters, the diva, the no-so struggling new stay at home dad, the playground mummys who hate, the work frenemies, and follows up on none of them. Not very funny and not very believable, especially the faded diva Mary Ford..and the PR guru Jack characters. This is one is a pass. The best thing about it is the cover."
2,Not very good.,"This is a story about a woman who ""must"" return to work while leaving her husband to care for the baby and home. The story lacks emotion and the characters are not very well developed, with the exception of Mary Ford (not the main character). It was a boring read and I couldn't wait to finish it; which I had to force myself to do. Not recommended."
4,Described just how I felt when going back to work after motherhood!,"I certainly recommend it for anyone who had planned to stay at home, but life decided otherwise."
3,"This is fun, it's fiction for gawd's sake","This was a fun read. I really liked the pace of the book, I liked the smart-alec wit of Julia the main character. I thought that Zigman nailed the 'mommy stuff'. I loved the husband with the gingerbread house that's perfect on his first try, of course and the three ring organizing binders and the coordinated Halloween costumes. So maybe that isn't the way we think of most husband but my girlfriend has one she says is a better wife than she will ever be! So it CAN happen! I enjoyed this, it was a quick easy read. If you want something substantial and deep this isn't it. If you're looking for something fun and suburban give it a try you might like it."
3,Audio CD version was entertaining,"This review is of the unabridged audio CD.The book took me a little while to get into. I'm not sure if it was the storyline or the narrator (this is the first book I've listened to by her) or some combination of both. But I settled in after a bit and the book kept me reasonably entertained as the time and chapters passed.If you are looking for an audio book in the chick lit genre that does not demand much active listening so you can keep your mind on the road or other activities going on while you listen, this would work."
2,How can you give this book 5 stars?,"I know I should really assume that people who rate books like this one 5 stars are relatives, friends and booksellers, but C'MON! This book started out nicely enough, caught my interest. But as I kept reading , I began to notice that the characters who promised to be round became very flat. The plot is so contrived that a twelve year old could have written the last three chapters. The husband, who is fired from his job in the first chapter, embraces being a stay at home dad to the point of creating gourmet meals, helping his wife's friends with organization, and creating vegetable costumes for the whole family. Puh-leeze! Cloying comes to mind. Skip it."
3,Definitely candy - not mints,They taste fine-a little sweet. They melt and break down instantly. I was hoping for more of hard candy or mint.
1,THEY DISOLVE TO QUICKLY,I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AND LIKED THE TASTE BUT THEY DISOLVE INSTANTLY AND I WAS CONSUMING THE WHOLE BOX AT ONE TIME. I WILL NOT PURCHASE THESE TABLETS AGAIN.
5,Great Mints,I have tried these and the tangy Xyla mints. These are worth the money and more. The tangy mints are a little weird.
5,Donkey's Gift,I read this book when it first came out as a Reader's Digest selection. I loved the obstinate donkey and how he helps take care of Mary and Joseph on their journey to Bethlehem. It is a great story for Christmas. I am using it for my book club selection.
5,Natalie Barney At Her Best,"Sometimes, it is difficult to follow the narrative, but Barney's sentences are sublimely beautiful. Writers don't write like this anymore. Barney wrote in a 17th century style of French, so the writing is formal but as well, poetic."
2,Not by her,"This book was ghost-written for her by Leo Guild without her input. He got so many facts wrong, and took so many liberties, that she ended up suing the publisher over them.There are much better books written about Hedy Lamarr, truly a remarkable woman worth reading about, but sadly she never wrote one herself."
1,Poorly written,"This book is very poorly written beginning with an incorrect date of birth, the lady goes on and on and never talks about her scientific accomplishments but harps on her sexual conquests which appears to me more timid than some stories that we know of from our personal experiences. May be it was torrid when it first appeared but now it seems pretty tame."
4,"NOT white, its satin","Don't be fooled by the picture, these are not WHITE, they are the satin nickel (grey) finish. For some reason I cannot find the 16 inch ones in white, I assumed by the picture that they were white, but when I got them they were not. When I more closely read the details I then saw it was satin nickel. Which is fine but not with white shelving in a white room. My fault for not reading details."
4,Great! Be sure to order enough (2 PAIR (4 brackets) for 2 shelves),"I made the mistake of thinking they came in pairs. I ordered what I thought was two sets for two shelves, but what I got was two brackets. So, I was left with one shelf up, the other on the floor with no brackets.No biggie, right? Just go get two more Rubbermaid brackets? Sure, except the only place I can find this particular kind (5E20) is on Amazon! And I live in the DC/VA metro area - there are plenty of places to go to. Aarrrgh! So, I have to order, and wait. In the meantime, my shelf is on the floor along with a bunch of stuff that would go on the shelf.Besides this minor mishap - the shelf system itself is awesome. I like the look, the quality is good, and they are strong, sturdy and durable enough to hold my books and other miscellaneous items. They will last a long time."
5,great!,The only place that I could find the bracket with clips was on Amazon!!This was easy to install and we had shelves in seconds
3,confusion...,It's been too easy to mix up these Fast Track items with regular closet organizer configurations - additional parts. This is just a note of caution!
4,A trip down memory lane.,I have not heard this album in years. I ahd to get it to relieve my childhood. There is a warmth here that is missing from recent collections of Christmas instrumentals.
5,Christmas in Beantown,"In Boston, Christmas music is synonymous with The Boston Pops, and for many people, Christmas music is synonymous with its legendary conductor, Arthur Fielder. The album contains many Pops favorites including Leroy Anderson's arrangement of Christmas carols and his well known Sleigh Ride. We actually hear the authentic rendition of Sleigh Ride on this recording since the Pops made Anderson's music famous. The recording includes classical favorites such as music from the opera Hansel and Gretel, Mozart's Sleigh Ride, a highlight from The Nutcracker, and Fantasia on Greensleves. Newer works include Al Hirt's Toy Trumpet. The recording concludes with the Pops timeless rendition of Santa Claus Is Coming To Town.As soon as the music of this recording begins, the listener is transported to Boston's Symphony Hall. So take a break from the hectic holiday season and enjoy the sound of the Boston Pops!"
2,the red and white,"this film is in black and white. characters are many, and they have short film appearances for the most part. one doesnt know which side is which most of the time, reds or white!! very haphazard film editing, story line almost impossible to follow. i though most of the people in the dvd were whites, but other reviews say they were reds. i dont think so , which is one reason this is a very confusing movie...why is was banned in the ussr after it came out i dont really know. dont see why though.. the acting is pretty bad too."
4,An excellent collection,"An excellent collection of almost all the Eurovision winners since 1956. From cheesy euro-pop (Ding a dong) to the anthemic ""Insieme,"" a wide range of styles is in evidence. Omitted here is the hauntingly beautiful ""Si la vie est cadeau"" -Luxembourg's 1983 winner. Perhaps the standouts are ""Waterloo,"" ""Ne partez pas sans moi"" and ""Un jour, un enfant."" It was a nice touch to include ""Congratulations,"" which was vastly superior to ""La la la."""
5,Track training schedules,This book is great if you're looking for detailed workouts overa whole season of training. It really takes the guess work out oftrying to figure out what workouts to do when. Excellent info for all runners up to elite levels. Well detailed...
3,Espana Classical Solid Top,"Received the guitar on time, no damage from shipping. There are approximately 20 small dots/bubbles below the bridge under the clear varnish, but the surface of the body/vanish is smooth. I guess they sent me a blemish product due to an on-line buying. No visual inspection on the guitar can make. I hope Amazon will contact the seller to send a better quality of the product."
5,The best.,"I know it's been awhile since this came out but I felt it was the time to review. When I first listened to this Cd's a couple of weeks after the movie came out I new this was one amazing piece of music. Every song fits the mood of the movie and the feel of vampires in general. To this day I still can not stop playing this Cd, the music never gets old. Every time you play it, it is like listening to it for the first time. To anyone who is hesitant to buying this, all I can say is you get your moneys worth and so much more. If you still can not get enough try listening to the score for Queen of the Damned. Thank You."
3,Disappointed--not the same music from the movie,"When my daughter, a goth teen, brought home Queen Of The Damned, I thought, ""Ugh! Another nausious horror movie."" But I was immediately drawn into the incredible music of this musical horror flick right from the get go. So I ordered the soundtrack CD from Amazon. Big disappointment! They're not the same versions of the songs as in the movie. Forsaken, for example, is not sung as well as it is in the movie. The versions of all these songs in the movie are sung with more emotion and are much better than those on this soundtrack CD."
5,This cd rocks!,"When I first bought this cd I thought It was going to [stink] majorly. But after listening to the entire thing I realised that the whole cd is Excellent. Althought Jonathan Davis sings none of the tracks, All of the songs are great. Redeemer and forsaken are my faves but I think everyone should buy this cd since the whole thing is good which is a rareity."
5,The Soundtrack being the best bit...,"I have to say, after seeing ""Queen..."" the soundtrack (and Stewart Townsend) is the best part. All of the music played in the movie was terrific, and in the best parts. The lip syncing wasn't bad, but the MUSIC is what stood out.The only qualm I have, if that, is the use of the song ""I Watched You Change"" (Deftones). It's really just the placement in the movie - during a scene with Lestat and Akasha. The tone of the song fit well, but not the part of the movie.All in all, if you like metal/punk/goth and all that, you'll really enjoy this album.Rube"
4,Wonderful CD for such a Harrible movie,This CD is so great... I play it on a regular baces at both work and home... It's one of those CD's that you only hate like 2 songs... You know how each CD there are always those cupple of songs that ya just hate (sometimes for no reason) this CD is extra cool cause it just has 2 (and sometimes only one depending on my mood).... It's all around great...
4,Great?...yep,"This cd is really great. The movie is ok too. I think that some of the people that gave this album a one-star should wake-up. I mean damn it's not the greatest ever but it sure as hell isn't the worst either. I love the atmosphere that is produced on this album. This is one of the best soundtracks that I own. ""Slept So Long"", by Jay Gordon of Orgy is one of the best songs on the album. Other standout tracks are ""Down With the Sickness"", ""Penetrate"", and ""Before I'm Dead"". The only track that I have a problem with is the Tricky song, ""Excess"", it doesn't really go that well with the other tracks, I skip that song most of the time. If you're looking for a dark, gothic influenced cd with a range of different artists this is great. If you don't like ""dark and depressing"" then stay away, it's that simple."
4,(four and a half stars),"I would give this five stars cept i just really hate that papa roach and the other music that did not make me think, queen of the damned.But, put that aside, i love this cd! I am not a goth fan but i love the songs that Jonathen Davis and Richard Gibbs made. The sounds are totally erotic. I love all these songs.I really love Kidneythieves- Before I'm Dead, it made a f-ing good ending song."
3,"good, but...","Which songs did Lestat sing in the movie? I really want to know. Please, can someone tell me?"
1,Just awful and boring!,"I think this ""soundtrack"" (if it can be called that) isjust AWFUL and boring! The songs are pretentious crap consisting mainly of Cookie Monster style vocals which are the worst I've ever heard. What is a fake shock rocker like Marylin Manson doingon this CD anyway? This is 100% corporate manufactured garbagefor angry teeny boppers stupid enough to buy it.I suggest you get a true Vampire-singer style CD and tryLucan Wolf instead. At least he can sing and would have beena better choice than ANY of the lame ""artists"" or bands on thisdisc. Avoid this hyped, out of date trendy garbage!"
1,Bad soundtrack for a bad movie based on a bad writer's work.,"So, you've decided to do a movie about a vampire who starts a goth band. Who do you get to provide the music? I imagine the board meeting went something like this:Chairman: We need someone to do the music for this movie about a goth band. Any suggestions?Executive 1: Peter Murphy? Nik Fiend?Executive 2: What about William Faith?Chairman's 12 year old retarded son: YO HOWZ 'BOUT KORN, THEY'RE DOPE.Chairman: You're a genius, my boy!In short, the entire thing is nu-metal, which is another word for CRAP. Don't bother."
2,Vamipiric Media Manipulation is gross,"Really now, looking over some of the reviews and accounts from others in person, this album seems quite overrated. It's a silly, childish goth-fest which sells, but doesn't produce. The tracks attempt to be dark and bloodlusty but fall just short of the intended effect and achieve only supreme depravity, except, perhaps, the Jay Gordon track. That one, too, was disappointingly weak, regardless of how catchy it might have been.Wayne Static had to put his two cent in with two equally dreadful tracks. His singing really is painfully bad, and ""Cold, we're so cold..."" always brings to mind an image of him sitting in front of a fire on top of a glacier, roasting a mastodon that he stole from his crippled grandmother.Oh, yes, and anything associated with Aliyah absolutely should follow suit with her and crash into the earth."
5,As Hot as the Movie Itself!,"This CD is full of thumping beats that make you think--..., hot, yummy!!! Great for road trips or just blowing off some steam."
5,kidneythieves kick ..!,"I got this cd after I sawthe movie, which I thought was really good. The music stood out and being a vampirs enthused freak, i bought it. It was awesome and it seemed to have just enoug goth and rock to make me happy. The songs made for the movie were the catchiest and were relly good. But the others stood out too. They came from bands not as well known but the best one wa kideythieves' ""before I'm dead"". That was incredible and their cd isssss so good. Now I am ne of their die hard fans. Well, if you don't aready have this cd, buy it please. Or just listen to the song at least. You'll be hooked, promise"
5,...,"Personally, I think the soundtrack was the best thing about this movie..The best song, of course is Forsaken, in fact all 5 songs Jonathan Davis and Richard Gibbs wrote are great.They are really powerful songs. I love this CD! Ok sure theres quite a bit of swearing but, were all mature enough to deal with it.For me, this CD was well worth buying, I love linkin parks Chester and I think Static-X is ok too. After this though Im gonna go listen to disturbed (David Draiman -Forsaken)."
4,better than it has to be,"for a 3rd rate movie, they sure pulled together a decent soundtrack...the Tricky and kidneythieves songs are first rate, and the David Draiman and Papa Roach songs are not far behind."
2,Could've been A LOT better.,"When I first heard of this soundtrack, I got all excited and bought it the 3rd day it was out. I listened to the ""Forsaken"" song by David Draiman first because I heard it on the radio. It is currently the only song I like! I don't even like the Chester Bennington song, and Linkin Park's my all-time favorite band! And this version of Static-X's ""Cold"" completly [stinks]. Could it be because i'm not really a big fan of goth? Or could it be because the artists just got lazy? Who knows. Get The ""Scorpion King"" or ""End of Days"" instead."
4,Awesome Compilation!,"If you're a metal fan this is a must! Some of the songs are older, like Deftones ""Change"" and Papa Roach ""Dead Cell"", but there's also new goodies from Marilyn Manson and can't forget Jay Gordon from Orgy, which is the reason I bought this CD in the first place! All the songs are good so get out there and buy it!"
5,Damned if you don't,"This piece of hard-ish rock will boil your blood with heat, and churn waves of gratifying violent emotions. Highly recommended"
4,If only Epic Records let Jon Davis sing....,"the cd would get 5 stars....but since Epic Records is full of greedy bastards who wouldnt let Davis sing on another label, it gets a 4. But of course, your getting this CD for the Head and Munky geeetar playing, and Davis writing 5 of the songs...All five of the songs he wrote are bad ass. System being the best song of em all. Look for the Davis version on your favorite file sharing program.I was kinda disappointed in the last 3 songs, since, in my opinion, they sucked.Its a pretty good CD, but, you can just as easily get the 5 davis songs somewhere else...if you wanna go that direction...Take this how u want, but its just my opinion."
5,Greatest Soundtrack,This is hands down the best soundtrack ever. Every song is great. Go and buy it.
5,Queen of the soundtracks,"This album overshadows any other soundtrack that is out there. You might be able to tell the Jonathan Davis songs apart form all the rest. Those are the ones you should be listening to. The first three tracks by Wayne Static, Chester form linkin park and David Drainman of disturbed are worth buing this album."
2,BIG Dissapointment.,"This soundtrack could've been a lot better. The only good new song is David Draiman's ""Forsaken"". All the other good songs ([stinks] as Deftones' ""Change (In the House of Flies"" and Papa Roach's ""Dead Cell"") are already released, and another song that would've been good is Static-X's ""Cold"", but they redid it and now that [stinks], too. Wayne Static's song is OK, but that's the only other one. The problem is that they're all slow. Not melodic, SLOW. And I usaully like slow songs, too.Oh, yeah:Linkin Park is my all time FAVORITE band. I like every single song they have, even their demos and the DJ songs. But Chester Bennington's ""System"" song completly [stinks]. Hope that gives you an idea.The movie sucks like a vampire, the soundtrack [stinks] like a vampire!"
1,TERRIBLE QUALITY! FELL APART,"These bases are terrible. The price appeared great, but after only one season playing Arc Mens Softball, they completely fell apart. The look like they are 20 years old. My old bases, which I gave away, are in much better condition than these. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! TOTAL JUNK THAT IS MADE IN CHINA! I am forced to buy new bases after only one season!"
4,Nice Visor for the price!,Visor was nice and matched my window tint perfectly on my 2007 Avalanche. My only issue was the screws were a bit too short but other than that no problems.
2,"Okay overview of the process...light on most topics, though.","Reasonable overview of the process required to build a data warehouse...however, most topics are given only light treatment. There are better books than this on data warehousing."
5,1 of JM's best,"This is a great album & shows the begining of Mr. Mayall's penchant for exploring , expanding & growing that would be the hallmark of his work.A friend gave me a cassette copy of this album back in the day. Although I was aware of JM this was my first JM album. I have had a CD ( the budget edition ), but , this edition is superior in every way.The sound is great , the bonus tracks are wonderful additions and the package is full of nice info about the band and JM"
4,A little something for everyone,"Very broad in its scope with enough depth to deal with the fundamentals while pointing the reader in the right direction for a more detailed treatment of the subject matter. Could be used as a text or reference book, or simply read as I chose, to broaden ones knowledge. Contains a good overview of the tools and techniques of radio astronomy. A fair bit of math employed, but not overwhelming to the educated reader. Reading level is geared toward a 3rd or 4th year undergrad in physics/astronomy but would also be useful as a primer for graduate level students or the serious amateur. Good book at a good price!"
4,Las Vegas season four,"Las Vegas season four was very good and entertaining, and i will recommend it to all my friends. I will buy the complete series."
5,Las Vegas Season 3,"James Caan is great. Love his acting abilities and he was perfect for this part. Recommend for any one who enjoys the carefree attitudes and possibilities of Las Vegas. Enjoyable entertainment, with lots of laughs and tears, ups and downs and zany situations and circumstances."
3,What happened..??,"I have ordered Season's 1,2,3,4, & 5. The third disc in season three would NOT play in my portable DVD player. The others were fine. The particular case for the third and forth disc was broken in the center. I could understand the Post Office breaking it, but NOT in the middle of the set..?? I am now very hesitant regarding purchasing DVD's on line...."
4,Awesome las Vegas,I love the chemistry and the action and the actors and the town. What more can I say!
4,Awsome,The dvd was awsome there is a problem with one of the disc though. Other than that problem everything else is great.
4,"Great, but one problem.","This is a great CD, but the problem is when you load it on to an I-Pod, the I-Pod cannot identify the CD or the contents of the CD. It does not recognize the songs titles or the cover artwork on the CD. I don't know why, wish I would have known before the purchase. I hope this review helps someone making the decision of whether to purchase it or not. Other than that the CD sounds normal."
5,Fine Compilation,"I've had the pleasure of owning (and wearing out) a few Keith Whitley Compilation albums, and I'd have to say that this one is the best basic, yet comprehensive, collections out there. The sound is excellent, and the 16 numbers provided here are a fair reflection of his ""much-to-short"" career. The usual biggest hits are here, including ""Dont Close Your Eyes"" and ""I'm No Stranger to the Rain""; but best of all is the inclusion of lesser known, but equally as good, ""Turn to Love"" and my favorite ""I'm Over You"". The price cannot be beat. Highly recommended."
2,Raw 101: Better Images with Photoshop Elements and Photoshop,"I am not unexperienced in Photoshop and I must say this book is difficult to follow at best. It is disjointed in it's layout, moving from Photoshop to Photoshop Elements willy nilly. Plus it does not give a lot real and useful information. It touches on the surface of the information but it does not go into detail. I much prefer the book Adobe Camera Raw for Digital Photographers Only, more useful information and written in a clearer and more concise manner."
3,Raw 101,This is the only book you need to understand how to shoot in raw formatand use the raw workflow.Wonderful book
3,Raw 101,The book is outdated and doesn't have the updated camera raw features so. It is lacking the new features to make it helpful
5,"Great book, excellent transaction.","The book itself is a text that we as Americans should read. Prompt shipping, I will buy from this seller again."
5,Love it!,"I wasn't sure of the quality of this product as I had added it to my registry on-line...well I was pleasantly surprised when I took it out of the package! And the bins that coordinate with this organizer are nice too! I have 3 of the coordinating bins on the shelf in the closet, the closet looks so organized! I hope it stays that way!"
5,For Space Saver Lovers!,We don't have lots of space and needed something to maximize the closet space. This organizer is perfect for organizing all of baby's small stuff. Eliminates wasted space and makes closet look 10 times better.
2,Only if you have no storage...,"We picked out these closet organizers for our closet to organize. Unfortunately, they take up quite a bit of space but also waste a lot of unsed space. They were not worth anything for any type of organization if you do have space. If you have a closet or other peices of furniture you are better off using what you already have then to buy this product. I would only recommend this if you have no space or room for your babys stuff. We were quite disappointed."
5,A Man Escaped,"This film is about the imprisonment and escape of Robert Bresson during World War II. What makes this film different from many escape films is that it strives to recreate the enormous challenges that a prisoner had to overcome to achieve his freedom. The Mozart musical score matches the emotional highs and lows that Bresson experienced at different times during his ordeal. The director/writer shows how his contacts with other prisoners caused Bresson to constantly readjust his original plans; though aware of the sufferings of his fellow inmates at the hands of the Nazis and their French helpers, he continues to move forward with his plan, learning from his prisoner friends' failings and bits of information about the prison. The climax of the film is very inspiring, and it is presented in a direct and exciting way."
1,Attention not paid to Spanish language detail,"This book is advertised as a beginner reader book for English and Spanish. However, while the English is on the beginner level, the Spanish is not for beginners. Additionally, the list of vocabulary words in the back includes some of the nouns WITHOUT the articles. There is no pronunciation guide. I believe that the Barron's I Can Read Spanish Language Learning Series is much better for the beginning English/Spanish reader."
1,Not worth the money,"I think that I can sum up my advice for someone wanting to read this book in four words... Read the bible instead. I think that George Calohan wanted to be a preacher rather than a cop because he spent the entire book quoting scripture and describing his own spiritual growth and trials rather than discussing the actual hunt for the Son of Sam. I purchased the book in hopes of understanding the ins and outs of a police investigation or learning about the ways in which the police caught this famous serial killer, but instead got a sunday school lesson. I would highly recommend buying any book other than this one. Something by Dr. Seuss would be more relevant to the subject..."
1,Tripoley Diamond Edition by Ideal/Cadaco,"BEWARE--THIS GAME DID NOT COME WITH A TURNTABLE AS ADVERTISED! It comes with a very cheap plastic stand that holds the chips. Nevertheless it says: ""Product Description:...This deluxe version comes with a rotating turntable for easier play!"""
3,Not what I expected,I wanted the one with the lazy susan. The description said it turned but it does not we glued a spice rack turntable to the bottom. Now it works.
1,Do not buy Cadeco silver version of Tripoli game board,"Totally disappointed in this ""toy"", already sent it back. I expected it to be a full size tripoli board and not a minature for a 2 year old. I was so thrilled to find it on the web site and then totally uphappy with the whole thing. I even had bought 2 extras for family members. We are now still using our full size plastic game boards that are years and years old. We have to put tape on the bottom of a few of the ""bowls"" because we have worn them through over the years. I also have one game with the plactic ""sheet"" that is totally worthless. Whether you use pennies, as we do, or chips , you need space to put them in and this new ""toy"" I bought, you could do neither. I will be looking around for a different manufacturer. Do NOT recommend this to anyone."
2,great game -- cheap plastic tray,Purchased this game to play with friends. Tray is really cheap and doesn't fit together properly. Great game but I wouldn't recommend this version.
2,Disappointed,"I have played tripoley for several years, but never owned a game of my own. My friends have older games that are of much better quality than the one I purchased. The pockets on this are way too small - it does not spin in place, you must turn the whole game piece, and the quality of the plastic just doesn't match up to the older versions of the game. I was very disappointed. I have not been able to find a better version anywhere - if I could, the one I purchased would definitely be retired."
4,Tripoley,"I have loved this game for years, my parents have the old version with the plastic mat that lays out on the table. We played this New Year's Eve with our neighbors and they enjoyed it too."
5,cherished memories,this is a game i played as a kid with family members that are no longer with me. its great to share it with my kids and keep the memories and traditions alive!
4,Fun game,"This is a fun game, actually its three games in one. We enjoy gettingtogether with other couples for game night, especially during the winter whenits cold outside and cozy inside. Everyone enjoyed it and so I'm happy Idecided to purchase it.The tray is easy to take apart and put back in the box when you are done.This is a combination of hearts, poker and Michigan Rummy but you can also justplay one game if you chose. You get the tray, chips and cards are all included.Enjoy!"
2,Great Game--Limiting Board,"My husband and I love to play Tripoley and we play often with friends and neighbors. It's three fun games in one and we laugh and have a great time playing it. When we bought the Diamond Edition we didn't realize that it was a small, plastic container that's incredibly inconvenient to manage. Tripoley is most fun when you have6 or more players. It would be a real challenge to get six people around this game to collect their chips, etc. We ordered the old felt green board and are back in business. It's much, much better to reach and navigate. We rate Tripoley with five stars, but this edition gets two stars."
4,Party Game,"Tripoley Special Edition, on its swivel base, is very easy to access by all players at the table. The pockets are most convenient to hold your bets (coins or chips) and the board is both easily read and durable. Great fun for up to 8 players. I use it often as a party game for an evening of fun and would recommend it for young (with chips) and old (with pennies or nickels). A great way to spend an evening with friends."
2,"Fun Game, but made Cheaply","I love this game and purchased this one because it said it was on a turntable. It's not. It's made out of the cheapest plastic that would no doubt be damaged after one use. Imaginea plastic disposible cup... Needless to say, I returned it and will most likely pay the extra money for a really nice version because the game itself, Tripoley, is great. I played it before on my brothers sturdy 1980s version."
2,"Still fun, but can't look past shoddy quality","Length:: 9:45 MinsI played Tripoley all the time as a kid and when I got it recently, I was excited...until I opened the box..."
2,cheap plastic crap,The old ones are better this is cheap plastic crap. I would have returned it but it wasn't worth the money to ship it back. Ended up finding an old felt board on ebay.
5,Cadaco Tripoley Diamond Edition,"Purchaed this game after playing with friends. A rotating game base really moved the game along! This Cadaco Tripoley Diamond Edition claims to have a rotating base, BUT IT DOES NOT!"
1,junk,"I have played this game for 40 years, starting as a child with the family. While I LOVE the game this version was a huge disappointment. The layout of the plastic trays is very confusing as opposed to the mat version where it is easy to see the chips in each catagory. I would not recommend this to anyone who hasn't played before. I am going to purchase the regular game with a mat."
4,almost great!,"I remembered playing this game as a kid and was thrilled when I came across it online. The game looks great. I only wish I could remember how to play it because the directions absolutely suck. I've had the game out twice so far and neither group has been able to play it because nobody can agree on what the rules are supposed to be. Eventually I'll take the time to go back online and find a source for the instructions. Once I find them, I'm sure I'll enjoy playing the game... did I mention that the directions that came with the game suck??!!"
5,Beautiful Story,I love this book. I read it in a world women's literature class in undergrad. This is one of my favorite books.
5,"A great read, very amusing!","I have to say that I 'enjoyed' this novel more than I usually enjoy Jane Austen, but in terms of raw literary merit, Austen is probably superior. Evelina is a really lovable heroine, and my only complaint would be her lack of action, but of course that's a sign of her time. This book made me laugh out loud and I was really sorry to finish it!"
3,What a difference 40 years make.,"Interesting. Haven't read it since college, and it seemed like a totally different book this time. As an older person, have less patience with the young protagonist."
3,"Not perfect, but pleasing","I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a sweet and sentimental classic. All in all an enjoyable read, but the writing style never dares equal the skill of Jane Austen.It has an interesting plot which, once you get wrapped up in it, is hard to disentangle yourself. Yet, I feel the plot could have been better developed by a more skilled novelist. Due to the fact that the book is written in passive letters (most of them Evalina's), the characters are often flat, and real active emotion is lacking. Several excellent opportunities for dramatic events are glazed over in a ""re-telling"".However what the book lacks can be overlooked, and take the tale at its face value: a gentle love story."
4,An Excellent Account of Propriety in the 18th Century,"This story, although seeming to take the shape of a soap opera with the many twists and turns of society, was spellbinding in its wonderful protrayal of decorum under usually wild circumstances. The young Evelina is thrust into society and into the hands of wolves, mostly because she is so beautiful. The most wonderful thing about her is NOT her beauty, but her elegant and ignomious education and charm. She a beauty to the core and always wishing to do the right thing. To share her difficulties is almost heart wrenching. To share her delight is heart warming. Evelina will steal your heart as she did Lord Orville's. Wait and see."
1,Didn't Work,"Even after returning the item once, the second copy didn't work any better than the first. I have tried it in every CD player and every laptop (even the MAC) and it says disk is corrupt. Which is a bummer because I was really excited to listen to the book. Oh well, I guess I am just out of luck because there is no way I am going to pay to send it back to get another piece of crap. Sorry to be so snippy but I am angry."
5,A great quick read for adventure and scienc fiction lovers alike,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read finished it pretty quickly, and found myself wishing for more when I was through. I loved the plot, and the main character. I will probably read it again in a few months, and have downloaded a few more books by H.G. Wells to read. If you're considering it, go ahead, it's only .99! I highly recommend it!"
4,A Classic,"Having read this book years ago, I decided to have this book read itself to me. I knew the books on Kindle were ""speech enabled"" but I had never used this feature. I had a blast listening to this book! (Every once in awhile, I would have to look at the text to understand when a quote had ended and a new character was speaking.) I have decided to ""read"" more free Kindle classics this way -- books I've been putting off for years!As the Product Information section revealed, this was H. G. Wells first published novel. As a debut novel, it is quite impressive. The story has been told and retold in these reviews, so no need to repeat them. I looked at the 1 and 2 Star reviews out of curiosity. Oddly enough, there are a lot bad ""kids reviews"" for this book. My guess is they saw the movie and didn't think the ""novelization"" lived up to the thrilling action sequences in the movie. Okay, so it's not a kiddies book. It is, however, a classic for a very good reason."
3,Brutal formatting,"I found this book somewhat awkward to read. The story was easy enough to follow, but it was written from the perspective of one man writing down the speech of another. 90% of the book is one run-on speech so every paragraph opens with a quotation. Combined with the god-awful formatting of this Kindle edition, it made this feel very awkward. Beyond this, I found the beginning and the ending of the book to be rather compelling (the middle drags). This is especially effective when you know much of the ending at the beginning, and we as the reader are left to guess as to how they get to that point. Because of the poor formatting, I am glad this came to me at no price."
4,Free SF Reader,"It will come as no surprise that the protagonist in this story, thetraveller, invents a time machine and uses it to venture into thefuture.The society that he ends up in seems amazing for a brief time, thenhe realises that all is not as it seems. There is a large underclassthat is terribly exploited to produce all this for the eloi, as theyare called.The underclass are named Morlocks, and it is here that the Time Traveler's sympathies reside."
3,THE TIME MACHINE,THE TIME MACHINE IS A VERY INTERESTING BOOK. EVEN THOUGH IT HAS ALOT OF HARD WORDS AND A LITTLE HARD TO UNDERSTAND YOU GET CAUGHT UP IN IT AND YOU WANT TO KEEP READING TO SEE WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT AND WHAT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE MORLOCKS AND ELOIS AND ABOUT WEENA AND THE TIME TRAVELER. ALSO TO SEE WHAT MIGHT ACTUALLY HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE IF WE KEEP TREATING EARTH THIS WAY. THE TIME TRAVELER THINKS THAT EARTH IN THE FUTURE IS PERFECT BUT WHEN HE FINDS OUT THAT MOST OF THE ANIMALS ARE EXTINCTED AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HUMANS HE THINKS OTHER WISE. SO THE TIME MACHINE IS A GOOD BOOK TO READ ITS A CLASSIC! SO I'LL BE READING THIS IN THE FUTURE AGAIN.
3,Rachelle D. p.2 A Mr. Moshe Review,"The ""Time Machine"" was a book written about a hundred years ago. It's mostly an interesting book with old english. To summarize, it's about a man who tells a story to important men about him time traveling about 800,000 years into the future and discovers how the world turns into. The Time Traveller, in which H. G. Wells calls him, adapts to the 800,000 life style of the Eloi's, the little future human race, and its peaceful and carefree world. After rescuing an Eloi, Weena, he realizes that they have a fear of ugly, nocturnal creatures. The ending is shocking and leaves you thinking."
3,Time Machine,"This book is ok, but might be a little hard for younger readers to follow. The story is presented in a factual manner, which reduces the excitement a bit. If you are looking for an older science fiction book that will invoke some thinking, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a book that you have to think about to understand, this is the book for you. The ending isn't all that great, but the story itself is interesting and suspenceful. Overall this is a good read."
3,The Time Machine,"The Time Machine by H.G. Wells is a great science fiction book with great mental effects. This book gives the idea that time travel is harmless and cannot hurt anyone. I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys science fiction and also for people who like reading adventure books. The only downside to this book is that it gives the impression that in the future, there will be no advance machines or technology. That is a part which is a bit depressing. Other than that this is a great book."
4,Time Travel and Social Commentary,"H.G. Wells was a modern utopian socialist. This sci-fi suspense is not only about the possibility of time travel, but a warning about the bleak future of mankind, created by extreme class divisions. Workers develop into nocturnal humanoid creatures who pray on defenseless and simple Eloi, also humanoid creatures and descendants of the 19th century upper classes. A decade after this book was written, Einstein's theory of relativity suggested that time travel was perhaps more than a mere sci-fi idea. But that evolution follows class lines in an unlikely, although interesting and original, idea."
5,Classic,A timeless classic that never goes out of style. Everyone should reach t at least once in their lifetime for sure.
1,Not a real book,It was only half of a book. Only chapters 1-5 were there and the remaining half were not included in the book.
3,Good read,Decent book and still relevant to this day. A Good quick read. I will be reading more of his works.
4,Language arts project,Very good book. Almost exactly like the library books I had to use. Not to mention this was FREE!! The twist at the end was surprising.
4,Interesting. Very interesting.,"This book is interesting. I would have never expected that we would end up with two specific races of people like that in the future. It makes you think about if we would see that ever in ""human-like"" existence."
3,Review for Time Machine,"The Time Machine is a pretty good book. The Time Travellor went down into the wells to explore. When he got down to the bottom, he laid on the floor to rest. I did not like this part because it seemed silly. If you were in a dark and scary cave, you wouldn't lay on the floor and close your eyes! I did like how the Time Traveller described the land, though. It sounded so lush and beautiful! The first setting was in England, late 1800's, in his house. The next setting was in the future, then in the Palace of Green Porcelin, then inside the wells (where the Morlocks live),then the last setting was even more far, far, far into the future.The main problem of the story is that the Time Machine gets stolen by the Morlocks. It was resolved because the Morlocks set a trap for the Time Traveller by setting the Time Machine outside so he could see it and come to it. When he went to get it, the Morlocks tried to get him, hut he escaped in the Time Machine. -S.J."
4,Is Time Travel Possible?,"I have always been interested in this book after seeing the original movie in the 50's. I really enjoyed reading H.G. Wells own words. This book held my interest and I couldn't put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone who asked the question ""Is Time Travel Possible?"""
3,"Great read, way too short.",This book was a really great read. Short and to the point. It could have been alot more interesting if the events would have been expanded on.
4,Now I know why it's a classic,Easy read and fun. I saw the movie years ago and the book filled in all the gaps. I've read other HG Wells and this is probably my favorite so far.
4,"review of service, then of book","I ordered this book but could not figure out where it wound up, so I couldn't read it. Then I got it on the FreeBooks app and enjoyed it. I'd still like to know how to find the copy I ordered."
3,Different Way of Writing Back Then,"I attempted to read one more ""classic"" story - H.G. Wells' The Time Machine.The way people wrote stories back in the day is very different than what I'm used to. For the books I read, I don't know all the answers until the final twist.For books that fall under the genre, ""Classic"" (i.e. Jekyll & Hyde, Invisible Man, etc...) you already know how things turn out.Take this book for example. The Time Traveler invites his audience to his flat for dinner. As they are waiting for him to join them at the table, he stumbles out of a doorway and proceeds to tell them the story of his adventure traveling through time.There shouldn't be any suspense because you already know that he survives the ordeal. Perhaps the purpose of this book, like it's classic cousins, is to inform the reader of some deeper point than just to deliver an action adventure story.Having said all that, I am glad I finally picked it up and finished it."
4,time machine,"I thought this was a mostly good book,but some parts were a little creepy. Also some words were a little too big (but hey, more dictionary practice!).On the plus side, the plot is interesting, and it is a definitely a book i d recommend. It seemed to me like it was a cross between mystery and science fiction. For younger kids, I'd advise a retold version because of some of the big words and creepy parts. Overall, I'd say this is a good book to read."
4,One of the pioneers in the sci-fi genre,"This book has alot in common with ""The War of the Worlds"" in the sense that it is also one of the books that helped shape the future of science fiction. It is also similar in the sense that modern readers might find it a little slow and hard to trudge through. But if you enjoy classics, then this is one to buy and read. A great and ""timeless"" story (no pun intended!) :)"
3,Aye,"I had to read this for English in preparation for an essay, which always has a way of detracting from a book, but even so, it's a worthy classic that presents you with loads of fresh, crisp images. It does lag in bits, but there are some stupendous bits that need to be read. As i remember it, some parts genuinely terrified me and i think Morlocks were the pre-amble for what has now materialised itself as my utmost fear and hatred of all spiders tht have the audacity to come within four feet of me. Minions. Well, read if you think it will benefit your life. If not, avoid."
4,Listen carefully!,"Listen up if you are hesitent to read this book. I had to read this for gifted English class, and I was ready to quit reading it after the first chapter (I only knew like half the words he used), but really, believe me, it gets a LOT better and more exciting. I hate science fiction books but the adventure was captivating. So please, stick with this book and I'm sure you'll enjoy it."
2,Seen better,"The time machine does a good job atracting people to it. The cover and the well written summery really brought me in. The begining really intriged me. I loved the descriptive detail the author gave, especially the part where the Time Traveler speeds through time. Once he stops in the future, is where I think the book could have been a lot better. My expectations are probably higher than most after reading the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. The reson I scored so low because I have seen a lot better."
2,Juvenile Fiction,"I was expecting a lot more from this book, as it was part of the Masterpieces of Science Fiction Collection from Easton Press. However, I wanted to make sure I wasn't throwing away $40 - $50 on a book just because somebody labels it a ""Masterpiece"". It's a good thing a read it first, because it was rather boring. This said, it was written some time ago, but still does not excuse the lack of depth in this title. I recommend ""Ender's Game"", by Orson Scott Card, or ""Dune"", by Frank Herbert, instead."
2,A bit too wordy.,"""The Time Machine"" had the potential of being an interesting novel, but came up short. I felt that the story was a bit redundant and unclear in parts. The descriptions of the places he went to and of what he saw, are what made the chapters the length they are - without them, it would be considered a short story. I do not recommend."
2,Boring,"I MUST be spoiled, because after seeing all versions of the movie and only now reading the book? I was bored out of my head. This was a free book on Amazon's Kindle so it wasn't a total loss, and it's nice to finally get to read the actual book vs. just a movie. Still, I was disappointed."
2,Cinthya C. Mr. Moshe review,The book the Time Machine is a book about a man who builds a time machine. He decides to go to the future. At first everything seem perfect but after spending days in the future he notices that it not. He meets Weena and the Eloi. Then he finds out about the Morlocks. Over all this book is a very challenging book but it a good book to read.
3,"A must read, but there are better books","This is a story that should be read for cultural literacy and the political satire, but it is really a mediocre book. Wells' is not a particularly good writer and his action is jumpy and characters are poorly drawn, but fortunately he is very creative so his imagination carries the day. This is a very short, easy read which would be great for book reports or a Sunday afternoon on the couch, but it is an excellent critique of late-19th century society and the ills of the industrial revolution and time travel stories are always intereting, particularly in this story in which the genre was basically invented. I would recommend it to students, science fiction fans and people who just enjoy increasing their general cultural literacy."
1,Terrible,"Do not read this book if you enjoy character interaction. This is definately not a character story. The Time Traveller doesn't even have a name, much less a personality. Never did I once care what happened to the guy. The plot, which Wells seemed to attempt to make interesting is rather bland. There were no motives other than scientific curiosity. Very unrealistic. The Time Traveller assumes that because the Morlocks are strange and ugly by his standards, that they're evil. He didn't even give them a chance. Looking at everyone as part of a stereotyped group, no one, not even the Time Traveller himself nor Weena, was an individual.What's worse is that this book had true *potential.* But potential left untapped is better off nonexistant. Don't expect too much from The Time Machine."
1,Worst book ever!!,The Time Machine is the worst book ever!! I had to read the book 1 chapter at a time before I was about to rip the book to shreads! DONT BUY THIS BOOK! YOU WILL BE DISAPOINTED!!
2,A Good Story,This story is the kind you read when you just need a good story without many intellectual challenges.
4,a masterpiece,It was a great book that was well written and truly deserves to be a classic if I say so myself.
3,The Time Machine,"It was a very strange beginning to the book, although the rest of the book was pretty interesting. I have to admit at times I was very intriged. I'm not sure if I would have continued with the book normally, but honestly I'm very happy that I did."
3,"Enjoyed, but wanted to like it more than I did","Another of the classic books I never read growing up, but have always wanted to. I had, however, seen the old movie version of this book a lot of times. I was surprised to find that the movie was a bit different than the book, and so reading this was refreshing!For someone who had been through what the main character had, I felt that his recollection was a bit unrealistic, though if it had not been, the book would have not had as much substance, and would have had to been written in a different way. Even so, I believe that being more realistic could have made for a more engrossing story. The other notion would be to have written the story in an autobiographical viewpoint, which would have been equally as good. Yet, the ending would have to have been different, in that case!Possible spoiler: Regarding the question posed at the end, my vote is that he returned to save Weena, and vanquish the Morlocks, providing freedom to the Eloi!"
5,Extremely Good Book,This book gives a very realistic view of the future thatmight be. The book may be fiction but the future it potraysmay not.
2,Classic science fiction,"A classic of the English language that should be read by all. This book is not enable for listening, that's why I gave it only two stars."
2,Good to read before bedtime,"I enjoyed watching the 1960 version of the movie as a child. I thought that if I read the book, that it would enhance my movie watching experience. Boy, was I wrong!This book was a slow tedious read. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Anything. It never did. All I wanted was for the book to end. Reading it was like dying a slow agonizing death. I forced myself to read the first seventy pages, then I could not stand it any more.The characters were uninteresting and had no personality whatsoever. The plot was way too basic and uneventful. Even the descriptions of the locations were bland.This book is good to read before bedtime. It will put you right to sleep."
3,A good book,"The Time Machine, in my opinion, was a one time read. I'm not a big sci-fi fan. To me this book was interesting but a little on the non-interesting side. If you know what I mean, there's times when it's exciting and leaves you wondering and then there's times when you think, 'What is this guy talking about?'. All in all it was a good book."
3,the time machine,I thought the time machine was a very interesting book and was well written and had a wide range of vocabulary.
3,The Time Machine,"I saw both the movies and read the book. They were way different, so you can't assume the book will be like the movie. The book was about a man, reffered to as the Time Traveller, who traveled through time. He ended up in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One. He discovered that mankind has divided into two types of creatures, the Ellois and the Morlocks. The Ellois are the Upper-world people who are vegetarians, and live a care free life, or so the Time Traveller thinks. A few days after his arrival, the Time Traveller then discovers the Morlocks, who are carnivores and live off the Ellois. The Time Traveller spends much of his time in the future searching for his time machine, which the Morlocks took in attempt to try to capture him. When the Time Traveller does escape, however, he travels even farther into the future and stops at the end of time.By Kristin Period 3"
4,A Good Book,"This classic novel has a compelling storyline with complex vocabulary. I would recommend this book to anyone that has a wide understanding in vocabulary and a good taste in sci-fi books. My opinion is that the adjectives and sentence structures in this novel are quite challenging, therefore my understanding of the complete plot was sometimes unclear. Any how, I really recommend this book for the middle school and up readers. I hope you choose this book because it's idea is very interesting as to how it applies in the real world."
3,THe Time Machine,"I thought the book the time machine was a very interesting book to read. In each chapter, the time traveler comes to a new climax that he must solve, and that is what gets you hooked. The main problem in the start is that the time traveler is trying to explain that he made a device that can travel to and fro. He then tests out the time machine and goes far into the future. This brings him to the problem of his time machine being captured by morlocks. Before he enters the future, he states that the future will be more advanced in everything, but he comes to find that he was definatly wrong. He then meets 'creatures' that seem to have no feelings. But then he meets weena. After that he goes through an amazing journey. He then finally gets back his time machine and goes back, but then no one beleives him, so he leaves again. Since then, no one has seen the time traveler in 3 years."
2,The Time Machine Review,"The Time Traveler was in his lavatory when he went into the future. This part was good but it was a little slow and too specific about how he felt.The Time Traveler landed in the year 802,701 and life was completely different. This part was alo slow but it was interesting to see what the author thought about the future.In this book there were many different settings. One of them was at the Time Travelers house in 1809. He was gathered with his friends and showed them a model of his Time Machine. Another one is in the future. There was tall buildings and a river. The people were called Eloi. There were also wells were the evil Morlocks lived.The main problem was the Time Traveler's machine was missing and was now stuck in the future. He thinks the Morlocks have taken it. So, the Time Traveler must find a way to defeat them.This review was written by E.O."
2,Uhm,"When you read this book, you have to take into consideration that it was written in 1893 (?). If you don't, the book is boring. Hardly anything happens. It's like the point of the book is not what happens after he travelles in time, but the time travel itself. I'm sure this was entertaining enugh when it first came out, but it's not today. We are too spoiled... It's nice to have read it because of the huge difference it made in the world of litterature, but if you just wanna read a book, I don't reccomend it."
5,Worth it for the Introduction,"There's about 100 different versions of the Time Machine for sale out there, but this is by far the one to get. Greg Bear is an amazing award winning sci-fi writer in his own right (Blood Music, EON) and reading his introduction to the Time Machine not only illuminates the text, but it also gives us a peak into his own mind. Bear deftly discusses Wells's scientific influences, the scientific culture of his time, and Wells's role in nearly single-handedly creating the sci-fi genre. Reading Bear's introduction to Wells is like hearing the Beatles talking about Buddy Holly: it doesn't change the original, it just helps you appreciate in anew."
4,Still good,"Last read in high school, that was along time ago. Can be a little long winded in places but still a good adventure."
5,not just sci-fi,"I enjoyed this book not just because of the science fiction slant (and HGW does a good job of theorizing time travel), but because of the thinly veiled commentaries, covering everything from class struggles to evolution. The narrative is a bit dry, but hey, I can deal with it, and the fact that this book was written so long ago only adds to the outstanding quality of the plot. A funny note - my edition was published in 1968, the cover showing the traveller materializing against a background of Eloi and Morlocks. The Eloi, as they should be, are represented as slight people covered with flowers, and the front & back covers as well as the intro page emphasize how this book predicted the coming of the ""flower children"" and how HGW foresaw the peace movement of the 60s. Yeah, it's a stretch, but cute nonetheless..."
5,A True Classic,"Why was I not forced to read this in high school instead of the tired old 'classics' they push at us? I read the book for the first time last night, and finished it in less than three hours. The symbolism of the future is clear, but beyond that it is also a really good story. This is how science fiction should read - an adventure around every corner. In addition, HG Wells' superb use of language helps this rise above the myriad of look-alike sci-fi out there today. This would be required reading in my world."
5,Sad Ending but Wonderful Story,I have very moved by the ending of the book. I wish Wells had written more though I see that he wrote enough for a great short story.
4,Wonderful Story,I love the details and the way the writer tells the story. The thoughts that go through the time traveler's head seem realistic and spot on to what an inquisitive mind would be thinking in those situations. I really wanted to read more after the story ended.
4,A good classic,"Not the easiest to read but worth the while, as most classics are. Although it's one of those books where, I would say, it really doesn't matter whether you watch the movie before or after."
5,Great time travel,"The Time Machine is one of those books I'd been meaning to read for years and finally got around to it this summer. I'm a sci-fi fan and enjoyed Wells's book, which was one of the first well known time travel stories ever written. It's a concise story without any unnecessary fluff, which makes it exciting all the way through."
4,Another great H.G. Wells read,"The Time Machine is a fun read about a time traveler who travels into the future some 800,000 years. The Time Travler speculates that humans have split and evolved into two different classes. One class is called the Eloi; they are a group of peaceful communists who have evolved into weak, unintelligent but elegant child-like beings. Strength and intelligence are no longer needed. Working-class humans have evolved into light-sensivite ape-ish beings called Morlocks who live and work underground. After traveling into the future the time machine is stolen, so the Time Traveler has to find a way to get his machine back so he can travel back to his familiar world.Now that I have read H.G. Wells' three most popular science fiction books (The Invisible Man, War of the Worlds and The Time Machine) I have to say that The Time Machine is my favorite of the three. Wells keeps the story short and simple, but very imaginitive."
3,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: It's a sci-fi classicWhat impressed me: The Time Machine was imaginative, even from a modern standpoint. It's look into the future feels plausible which is a feat given how long ago it was written.What disappointed me: I saw the movie first and it was very different. And in my opinion, better. I just could not get into the interactions with the races, which was the bulk of the story. I found myself much more interested in how he traveled as opposed to where and when he traveled to.Recommended: Not especially. I much prefer the movie."
4,Great Classic,"I had seen this as free book, and I know of H.G Wells as classic science fiction writer, and I had never read this one.Very good read, where I just kept reading and reading. The writing is a older style, and some words I used the kindle dictionary to help here and there.It was shorter then I had thought it would be, but I did enjoy reading it. Rather then a novel or eppic, it is more like a short story, not sure of definition but it is just over 100 pgs long."
4,Good read,A good read for the I can not say how many times. Always a fun book to reread in the many books of his.
5,Subtly Sucks You In ...,"As the author ofThe Cloud King: Thunder Nuggets and Fog, I definitely prefer both science fiction and fantasy books where the escape from reality ""creeps up on you."" The Time Machine, a science-fiction classic, does exactly that.In the beginning, you're reading a historical novel -- very straightforward, except that you start getting hints of more than what's scientifically possible. As the story progresses, so does the ability to move through time. Before you know it, you now believe in time travel. And that's just about the point that H.G. Wells takes you on a wild ride through time.How would fashion change as the years progressed? What would happen if you went so far forward that society and civilization as you knew it collapsed and was replaced with something new?By the end of the book, you'll believe in coexisting societies, destiny, and .... time travel. This is what I call a ""must-read classic."""
3,ok download,"i tried to download this and quickly realized that it was not going to work to well for me, not the downloads fault, simply to hard to format to read on my device. deleted the book."
4,Certainly Good... With One Nitpick,"The Time Machine has been my favorite book for many years. I have read it 7 times and I know I will read it many more. Therefore, this review is not about the story, but the edition of the book itself. It's very difficult to find a hardcover version of such a small book. The binding on this edition is great and doesn't feel cheap. The paper quality is good for the price. Overall, I would have given it 5 stars if not for one gripe: They included illustrations. I was most disappointed to see pictures which did not match up to my grandiose visualizations of the book's many amazing locations. The cartoony representation of the Eloi was my least favorite part. They looked more like the dwarves from Snow White than the graceful, diminutive people which they were described as. If you can get past the visual setbacks, this would be a nice edition to have on hand for those ""I'm really in the mood to re-read it"" times."
4,Traveling Through Time,"I very much enjoyed Wells' writing. The atmosphere of joining a group of people in a room while listening to the Time traveler's experiences was quite mesmerizing. The adventure and worlds he elegantly paints are definitely images that still wander in my mind after finishing the book. It appears as if Wells has built a social criticism of his times and the future it awaits, although I cannot help thinking that he is encapsulating the dichotomy of humanity in a story of the future. Regardless, a very enjoyable and short read reaching into the Victorian realm of fantasy and science fiction. I will definitely pursue more of his works as well as take a peek at his nonfiction. Apparently he wrote all his famous stories as a young man in his 20s."
1,A BAD BOOK,"1. I liked the part when the Time Traveler was in the forest and the Morlocks attacked becasue it was exciting.I didn't like the part when the Time Traveler was showing his guests the Time Machine because it was boring.2. In the book the the settings were at the time Traveler's house in his labratory in the year 1899, then in the land of the Eloi in the year 802,701, then even farther into the future in a land unkown.3. The main cnflict in the story was that the Morlocks stole the Time Machine and the Time Traveler was stuck in the future. The way he got it back was the Morlocks set a trap and when the Time Taveler went to get his Time machine the Morlocks attacked him. he luckily fought back and made his way to the machine and left the future.G.W."
1,This book is terrible,"1.I like the part when the Time Traveler went down in the wells and fell asleep on a rock and the Morlocks were looking at him when he woke up.I didn't like the part when he got emotionally atached to Weena because she is just a little weird girl that is as smart as a 5 year old.She is from the future and he doesn't even know her that well.2.t he settings are in his kichen in the year 1899, the way future with the eloi,and even longer in the future with crab like creatures.3.The problem as that the Morlocks took his Time Machine. If he didn't get it back he would be stuck in the way future. He solved this ptoblm by goin in the sphinx and getting it when the door was open. The Morlocks tricked him and tried to get him then, but he was too fast and went even further in the future to escape them. He then went back to his time and told people about it.T.A."
1,Horrible,"This book was one of the worst books I have ever read. The author make an attempt to sound as though he has an extremly high vocab. in the beginng of the book by using words that most average people don't know, but then stops as the book goes on almost like he ran out. The story itself wasn't bad but the way it was told was. From the start you know the ending, but then at the end the author make an attempt to change it in a way he did, but in away that it would not have mattered if he did or did not. I would like to finish by saying if you like sci-fi stuff you might like this book, but if you don't you'll probaly hate it."
3,The Time Machine,"The Time Traveller made his frind push the leavor of the Time Machine model so the other frinds would not think that he was playing a trick on them. I liked this part because he was being smart. I also liked when Weena was saved by the Time Traveller and got so attached to him afterword. I thought that this was cute.The first setting in the book was in the Time Traveller's house. He lived in England in the 1800's. He was in two different rooms,the dinning rooom and his laboratory. His Time Machine was located in his laboratory. Thye next setting was in the yeasr 802701. He meet littlepeople called Eloi and Morlocks who ate the Eloi. The last setting was further into the future. Here he found giant crab-like things.The Time Traveller's main conflict was getting his Time Machine back. He got it back by falling into a morlock trap. They ambushed him' but he soon got away and zoomed off.-MG"
3,I think that The Time Machine was a very good book.,I think that The Time Machine was a very good book. I especially liked the way Herbert George Wells mixed science with fiction and added a little mystery ending to the story.
5,H.G. Wells was the first.,"Regardless of what an earlier poster claims H.G. Wells was the first to write a novel about a Time Machine. That being said,I recommend this book to anyone."
4,Good Science Fiction Story,"H.G. Wells' The Time Machine sets a presecedent in the genre of time travel stories, books, and movies. The short novel explores a future far stranger than those assumed by later distopian works like Brave New World and 1984, or even more current movies like the Back to the Future Series. The future envisioned by The Time Machine has neither glaring technological advancements nor a strict government. Instead, Wells envisioned that a far distanter future would eventually lead to mankind's decline. Although the story is often thought of as pure science fiction, it contains a prevailing theme against class structure and an anti-Darwinian theme by juxtaposing the Eloi with the Morlocks.The Time Machine may not be the most in-depth science fiction when compaired with some of its offspring, but it was definately one of the prominent forerunners of the genre. It is also a short and intreging read."
2,Best part is that it is free,"I couldn't get into this book and didn't read more than a few pages, skipped forward and couldn't find anything that interested me. It might be the book for you and since I didn't actually read the book, you might want to ignore my 2 stars."
5,An in-depth look into the ingenious mind of H.G Wells,"To be honest with you, I only found out about the Story ""The Time Machine"" while I was looking for a copy of ""The War of the Worlds"". I really didn't have any interest in the book at first, but I figured I owed it to myself to read it with such good reviews. And boy was I ever surprised by this AMAZING book.This is just one of those books that has ""it"". I mean, it's a facinating trek to the year 802,701, with every time I open this book. H.G Wells was one of the most amazing writers to ever live, and that is evident within the first few pages. It is H.G Wells genious and painstakingly intimate amounts of detail that make this book a real voyage. From the ""new"" Earth of 802,701 to the amazing description of the Time Traveller's voyage in the time machine itsself, this book really shines.I recommend this book highly to all those interrested in an amazing journey. Truthfully, this is THE book to read on a rainy day."
1,Great tale--but this version is incomplete!,"I advise a high school sci-fi club, and I was thrilled when they asked to read H. G. Wells' The Time Machine. Excited to get them started with the book, I ordered a dozen copies (on a 4-for-3 promo since I was using personal funds to purchase the books) and distributed them as soon as I received the shipment. Imagine how upset I was to learn that these books do not contain the full text of the book; they stop in the middle of part V. I cannot return them for a refund, as I gave out all copies to students and they began annotating their copies as soon as they began to read.Wells' novel is wonderful! This edition is terrible..."
3,The Time Machine,"The Time Machine by H.G. Wells. I believe that this is a book that many people might like reading in the beginning. It touches on one of the things that humanity has wanted to do for ages. To be able to go back in time. So in this novel the Scientist gets the opportunity to do so. He creates his own working time machine. He then goes into the future. Here he has many interesting adventures with the futuristic people. Yet, his time machine is gone one day. So now he starts his journey to get it back. This story is well a classic and most people should read it. It ends with a small disappointment yet I don't want to spoil the ending for you. Well I give it 3 stars because it is an interesting read, yet it may not and is probably not right for everyone to enjoy."
3,time machine,"The Time Machine written by H.G Wells is a book in my opinion which is written to connect to those who have an interest in reading about an adventure with twists and turns. The book as a whole is for one that reads books that may not seem to be realistic and is very imaginative. I am one who enjoys reading stories that connect to me as a person with events that I can relate to. But at the same time I am one who desires to finish a book to see the outcome of the story as a whole. The turn in this book was traveling back to the fourth dimension and the twists were being an environment split having Good and Evil. As a result, ""The Time Machine"" is a book that can get people interested but also one that makes people only want to finish it only to see what the outcome will turn out to be."
5,"Good Philosophy, Excellent Story, also read SB 1 or God","This is a masterpiece of creative writing and venture in time hundreds of thousands of years forward. What the protaganist finds is amazingly entertaining, Peace and Harmony. If you are interested in material as such this is the Icon. The Name H G Wells speaks for himself. I also recommend a book that goes back in time to the beginning and only 29,000 years into the future, where people have evolved into...They wish to return for us, Title is SB 1 or God by Karl Mark Maddox a super read."
2,The Time Machine,"I did not like The Time Machine. I thought that it was sort of boring and I could barely keep reading it. The actual machine itself was ok but I did not like the diologue that H.G. Wells put into the book.When it got to the part where he first goes to the future I almost went to sleep right away. I was very bored and I almost picked up another book.Anyways the book is about a man that goes to the future and meets up with these small people that eat fruit all day. Then he meets the mongrels that eat the small people. Which I think is sort of stupid.In the book H.G. Wells doesn't, I think, portray the time traveler as he should be portrayed. I think it would also be nice if could have given everybody names instead of calling them their profession.Over all I give this book a 2 out of 5."
4,"Wry Epoch, Or Mood Piece? Still A Classic.","A psychologist builds and uses a time machine to travel 800,000-30 million years into the future. It is made of Ivory, Crystal, and Nickel, with two levers for control. I found his turning the hypocritical Victorian society inside out to be refreshing and made the book a fast page turner. His not using overly technical language was another plus. The future society he described was intruiging and scary in its extremes. The gentle Eloi being taken care of by the slavish Morlocks makes the reader think of other historical eras where the few parasitically lived off the many. Feudalism and Communism come to mind. But, in this world the Eloi send their own on a regular basis to be fed to the canabalistic Morlocks. This book makes the reader think and encourages one to want to read more about both history and other fiction novels. For that alone, it deserves four and a half stars."
5,A Great Classic,"The book the Time Machine by H.G. Wells was a great book. I liked it a lot and highly recommend it to people who like science fiction books and like the older classic books.This book was very interesting because the Time Traveler had found differnt types or species of people and ancient ruins of his time. It was also adventurous because in that he fights and outwits one of the type of people that became his enemies. Also the author was very creative by his theories and detail when he is travelling through time.""I came back to his house but he was nowhere to be seen"" said the narrator of the story. This book was creative, interesting and adventurous with the theories of the Time Traveler and his explanations. Also the use of fire made the book adventurous and interesting. The authors imagination and creativity had a great influence on this book. He made it very exciting and made me not want to put it down."
4,"An imaginative and enjoyable tale, rich with meaning","As with all his works, Wells demonstrates that he was truly ahead of his time in this novel. The opening scenes are very memorable and set the stage for wonderful chapters to follow. As characterstic of all of Wells' writings, there is much more here than just an entertaining story. His books always contain deeper themes and ""The Time Machine"" is no exception. He crafts a brilliant tale here while interlacing it with philosophy, politics, human nature and more. While this isn't as warm an introduction to Wells as ""The Invisible Man"" or ""War of the Worlds,"" this is reading I recommend highly."
5,Simple Perfection,"I've been meaning to read this book for the past 15 years, and I can't believe I waitied so long. This is one of the best sci-fi novels I've ever read. It is short, simple, and nearly perfect. This is about the ultimate human invention and the ultimate human adventure. the protagnist is part time traveler and just as importantly part story teller. In the far distant future he witnesses and ponders humanity's fate. A must read."
5,Another Timeless H.G. Wells Classic,"Here's another Wells classic that has been adapted to the silver screen at least twice. But the story of the Eloy and the Morlocks plays even better to the reader, who gets to fill in the details from the richness of their imagination."
3,"Not what I was expecting, but not bad","This was a required reading for my science fiction and fantasy class, and it was one that I rather enjoyed. The characters are purposefully ambiguous, forcing the reader to focus solely on the plot. I'm not a big fan of the lack of character development, but the story itself as well as what it implies about the future, add well as current state, of humanity leaves much to question."
3,Interesting but dissapointing,"While this was a rather interesting book, it was disappointing. Not enough happened."
2,Stephan 's Review P.5 Mr Moshe,This book may seem very interesting but it really isnt. I gave this book two stars bacause i felt that the hoook was pretty good. But once it got my attention it soon lost me. The ending really wasnt worth my time. I could have been reading tons of other books within that time period. I really did not like this book and I hope you dont go throught the sa me torture that i did.
3,good,"It came in a timely fashion...however, the product was mislabeled. The item I got did not have the same cover as was advertised."
2,The Time Machine,"Well The Time Machine was an ok book. It could have been better. Wells does a great job at describing the future from his view point. High points in the book were chapters 4 through 9 thats where the Time Traveller goes to the year 802701 and meet carnivorous creatures called Morlocks. One thing I did like about the book is the epilouge after chapter 12 saying that the Time Traveller never came back, it was a great cliffhanger. All in all, The Time Machine is an ok book. I strongly recommend this book to H.G. wells fans."
3,Maybe a little dated,"This novel is a classic for a reason. The writing is excellent and the thought process behind it are even better. This novel was not only about time travel but about consequences of social philosopies. Some of the science in the novel is dated but it does not really detract from the novel very much. It loses one star for length though. Wells could have written an epic here and totally missed his chance.Do not confuse this with the recent movie. The only similarities are that they both were about men in time machines going forward in time.I would classify this as appropriate for all ages, although, some of the language and ideas may be hard for younger children to grasp."
3,The Time Machine,"I havent read the book yet, but I have heard that it is very good. And it was a free download"
5,Hahahahahah,Have yet to read it..... But hey it's free so why not download it! Let me know if it's any good!
4,The Time Machine?!,"If you were to build a time machine where would you go? In the story, THE TIME MACHINE, the time traveller goes into the future to see what the human's outcome is. Instead of finding a sophisticated human race, he found Eloi and the vicious Morlocks who ruled over them. The Morlocks steal the time machine and after many quarrels and fights with them he manages to retrieve his Time Machine once again. He travels back to his time only to be dissapointed that none of his friends believe his incredible journey. The last anyone saw of the Time Traveller was when he jumped into his time machine and vanished. That was years ago now and no one has seen him since. Did the Time Traveller go into the past or back to the future? No one knows for sure."
4,Review for the time machine for Mr. Moshe by. Michael Munoz,"H.G. wells book the time machine is a very interesting book that always keeps you guessing about what will happen next. The whole story is really just about the Time Traveller a very intellgent man that constructed a time machine. With his time machine he goes all the way to the year 803,701 and in the begining he meets the Eloi evolutinized people who are care free and live in a perfect society , well that how it seems at first. He also makes a friend , Weena that first presents the fact that the eloi have also fear that is the darkness. Then the Time Traveller learns about the Morlocks melicious creatures that live in the underworld and that have taken the Time Travellers time Machine. The rest of the book is just about Him tring to get his time machine back from the Morlocks , and the Time traveller returning back to his own time."

4,Wells Was Far Ahead Of His Time!,"This is a cool book from Wells. In it he takes a giant leap into the future, more precisely year A.D. 802701! This is an action packed novel, it's really quite amazing that it was first published all the way back in 1895! Because the action level is equivalent to a Dan Brown novel. Of course Wells is far better than Dan Brown, because Wells is not only action he is also vitamin! The novel ends with the words ""in the heart of man"". That end is kind of a signature for Wells' work, because he was really curious, and of course the curiousity was particular related to what a human can do? What a human is? What a human can become? What there is in the heart of man?"
3,A Very Imaginative Book,I found The Time Machine to be very imaginative story. It takes you away from reality and opens your mind to the future. It actually makes you use your brain and think. It was nice to read a book that turned on your imagination skills. H.G. Wells had an extensive vocabulary. I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to people who enjoy science fiction books.
3,The Time Machine,"The Time Machine was an entertaining book about time traveling. I thought it was interesting for a few reasons. First of all, everyone has their own ideas about time travel and what the future might be like. Through H. G. Wells' story, he incorporates his personal theories about the future. Furthermore, the conflict between the Morlocks and the Time Traveler keeps you at the edge of your seat because you don't know if the Time Traveler will make it back to the present time. Also, The Time Machine is very descriptive. From the delicate flowers to the grungy wells of the Morlocks, the author does a wonderful job explaining the strange, futuristic world. At times, I felt like I was in the story, because the descriptions were so detailed. The Time Machine was a great book, and I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in time traveling or about the future."
3,it was ok,"I quite liked it, but it would have been better if I had read the book before seeing both movies - this way the book didn't bring anything new, which is a shame."
3,The time machine,"It was a good book. Having seen the 1960 movie, however, I couldn't help but picture the movie characters when reading the book."
5,Great Book,Always loved this book/movie. Great to be able to find good prices on it online. Hope others enjoy it too.
4,growth in classism?,"The Time Machine is a classic novel about an unnamed traveler that adventures to a different, futuristic time. He finds this future has 2 very separate worlds. One made up of the fortunate upper class that is intelligent and small in size. The other a boorish lower class of workers, forced to live underground. This timeless piece outlines the possible consequences of a growingly divided world between the more and less fortunate. And the differences between the physically superior and the mentally superior. Wells paints a vivid picture of this future world with descriptions of the settings and characters appearances. However the one thing that is most vague is the chief character that is not even awarded a name but is called simply ""the time traveler."" This book outlines the conflict involved with classism and is still relevant in today's society. It is a must read for all people interested in classic literature."
2,The Time Machine,"The Time Machine was a fairly entertaining book, although I do not like how the author wrote it. It's a good story that I would recommend it to people, but I just don't like the way he wrote it out. It was very detailed and made you think. Although there were many parts in which it got boring. Also I'm not much of a fan for time travel, I would really recommend it to those who do."
2,I don't think much of this book!,"Although I am quite a fan of the works of H.G Wells, I have to say that this book was a disapointment.Unfortunately, it held far too socialist a view for me; the originallly wealthy people degenerate into a useless race who cannot do anything to stop the people of the underworld.The working people ,on the other hand ,control the people of the upperworld,and prosper.I found that the end,too, was unsatisfactory.I would not have minded if the hero had at least died in the end! Instead, the ending and the fate of the hero was unresolved. In conclusion, I cannot recommend this book;probably the only Wells book, I DO NOT like!"
2,The Time Machine,I bought this for my 10 year old son who saw the movie. He didn't like the book and said it was too slow starting for him. He also said the movie was better.
2,THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE-TIE IN,"I am a big H.G. Wells, THE TIME MACHINE; fan... If you are looking for this novel to be the official Motion Picture Tie in just because it has Guy Pierce as the Time Traveller. All of you will be disappointed. I have to rate this a 2... For several reasons...1. The cover of the novel is misleading.2. This novel again has nothing to do with the March 8, 2002 movie release.3. Very misleading Foward by Simon Wells.The reason to give this a 2 is clear. It's misleading but it's still Wells... The orginal novel. Guys save yourselves money if you really want the Time Machine novel buy the Bantam edition. ISBN 0-553-21351-2 US people pay 2.95 for the same novel... Minus the Simon Wells, introduction which is nothing more than bragging rights to the new movie.Buy the cheaper book... save your money... by not buying this unfortunate money making edition of a classic. Simon wells, is not worth 2 dollars more."
4,Liberalism of the Future.,"This book's underlying tone is a siren to humanity. A warning as to the decay liberalism always engenders. A classic book, with a sage message."
3,"Mr. Garden says ""hi.""",This book was okay. Read it carefully and try to understand it. Just try the first 20 pages and see if you like it. It's about a time traveller who goes in the future and the society isn't smart and advanced as you'd think. 5165846518
3,Not as good as the movie,"This is one of the few cases where a movie based on a book is actually better than the book.The movie, although dated by today's standards, brings the machine's inventor to life and lets us see that he has true concern for the welfare of people in general, and the welfare of future generations in particular. His relationships with the Eloi of the future are far better displayed in the movie.The book's writing style is stilted and at times much more difficult to follow that it needs to be. It is a wonderful story, but the writing often obscures the story."
3,not truely original,"I don't mean to badmouth H.G. Wells; he was a talented, intelligent man. His work The Time Machine is thought to be orininal by most people. However, after some research, I realized that this novel is not as original as one thinks. Many aspects of this novel were already used, if not trite. Several scenes were similar from previously published novels; even some of the topics he discussed (evolution, time travel, class structure) were intertwined in earlier novels as they were in The Time Machine. It was, for the most part, enojoyable, but it certainly was not completely original. This really has nothing to do with the quality of the work in itself; out of the three novels I've read by Wells, this is the best one. Besides the fact of its triteness, the novel was well written and deserves to be a classic. I don't know if anyone reading this knows of H.G. Wells thoughts about sex and such, but for some reason, his relationship with Weena reminded me of his troubles/thoughts on sex."
4,Much more than a Science Fiction story,"The Time Machine was an early novel by Wells.He is a wonderful author in his abilities to blend the elements of science fiction with social commentary and human feelings.The relationship between the Time Traveler and Weena is special.The true moral is said in the final sentance-that even when mind and strength have gone,graditude and a mutual tenderness live on."
3,The Time Machine,"When the Time Traveler and his Time Machine go forward in time, no one really knows what to think. In his travels, he sees everything from four-foot tall men to the concavity that comes from seeing the absence of life. His most incredible travel is his travel to the year 8??? AD, where what he sees more resembles the past than the future.I rather enjoyed this book; it always seemed to keep me on edge. I would recommend this book to any fans of the sci-fi genre that enjoy tales of fantasy and adventure."
3,Not for adolescents,"The school where I am teaching had this book in the syllabus to do in the beginning of 8th grade but after carefully reading through the book and assessing its advantages and disadvantages it is clear to me that although the book is a fantastic sci-fi novel and intricate portrayl of a futuristic world, it is not a book for adolescents or young adults. The language, although beautiful, is antiquated and the meaning gets convoluted in many ways. The vocabulary is extremely advanced and the theoretical diatribes are way out of a Middle School or early High Schooler's league. Kids would struggle through this book and not get to enjoy it as they might with a less complicated read. H.G. Wells has written a beautiful piece of literature but I suggest that you choose your audience carefully if you plan to share it with less than advanced readers."
2,Pretty Lame,"Bottom line is that there's just not much to this story. Weak characters, an uninteresting plot, and a lame mystery just left me flat. This is the first Maigret mystery that I have read, and to be fair maybe I just don't care for his character and that bled into my opinion of everything else. I don't know. Whatever the reason, I just didn't care for this book at all and found it to be quite dull."
3,"Decent Domo plush, but don't expect perfection...","As ""TappiCat"" noted on Dec. 10, 2011, the Domo I received also had visible hot glue in the mouth area (specifically near the teeth). My particular plush also multiple quality control defects: one of the inserts within his feet was tweaked, meaning that my Domo can't stand on a flat surface like he's supposed to; the stitching/fabric junction of one of his arms to the body is done really badly, so that the seam is really weak; one of his eyes is glued on higher than the other; and the lower teeth are not cut right. I fixed the badly cut lower ""teeth"" (it's white felt) and removed the excess hotglue and it looks better. I've provided pictures of all of these defects so you can see what I mean. If you're just going to sit him on a shelf somewhere, not a big deal, but this version isn't a carefully made, high-quality item, nor should you expect it to be for the very low price. Also, by my measurement, he's 9"" tall, not 10"" as stated."
1,We Can't Dance If We Wanted To... :(,"First off, I love this group and I have most of thier stuff on CD or vinyl. The reason that I give this such a poor rating is that Men Without Hats DID NOT RELEASE THIS AT ALL!!! Oglio Records put this out without permission of Men Without Hats who, as a result, got nothing out of this! Secondly, the songs are not in the order that they were on the vinyl cut AND Oglio put that butchered 2:45 single version of ""The Safety Dance"" on instead of the 4:32 album version. Thirdly, ""Antarctica"" is not a bonus track, I have the vinyl version and it follows ""The Safety Dance""! So, needless to say, I was NOT amused. To this day, I am constantly searching EBay for the official version of each of the CDs that make up this compilation and will pay a very pretty penny to get them... thank you."
1,Antarctica on cassette I bought in the 80's,"I don't know whether it was on the lp, but it sure was on the original release cassette, and not as a ""bonus"", either. I hope that they release Safety Dance somewhere soon, these prices are ridiculous!"
5,Classroom use of THE DEATH AND LIFE OF PHILOSOPHY,"I have used Robert Greene's THE DEATH AND LIFE OF PHILOSOPHY to provide an overview of philosophy for students in an introductory philosophy course. Greene is a very skilled writer and knowledgeable scholar who explains the ideas of major philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Kant, and Hume with insight and humor. While some students may find the text demanding, it should inspire them to delve more deeply into the subject matter than they would otherwise have been inclined.Not all readers will accept Greene's call for a return to a more Aristotelian perspective, but his presentation of his case for Aristotle gives the book an elegant unity.Several of my students have commented favorably on the book. One said that, once she started reading it, she could not put it down. Her comment is consistent with my own impression of the work."
1,Piece of Junk!,"NOT worth the money. The board is just painted pressed cardboard. Ours came all chipped and splitting down the sides. It is cheap and flimsy and sags in the middle, even with the legs properly set. For the price, this set is a rip-off and won't last one season. Save your money and buy a real plywood set with real corn bags (and not tiny plastic beads)."
1,PIECE OF GARBAGE,"I bought this for a BBQ, and within 10, yes 10 minutes, the entire thing fell apart. First the board split down the side, fixed that with duct tape.Then the plastic covering the whole broke off on one of them. Then the middle part of the OTHER board collapsed. This is from regular playing, nothing special.It literally is cardboard pasted onto cardboard.Legitimately the worst product I have ever purchased in my entire life. I never write reviews on things I buy but I have to warn people about this piece of garbage.DO NOT BUY"
2,Chuck-0 rating,After 30 minutes of play the plastic rings around both holes fell off. I recommend buying Baggo instead. Chuck-O is a cheap piece of c__p!
2,Made for kids only,"Do not buy this if you are an adult who like playing bags, repeat do not buy this if you enjoy bags. After only about 20 minutes it was clear how cheaply this is made. The construction seems solid enough with it's weight, but when you unfold it and ""chuck"" a few bean bags you'll see it quickly fall apart before your eyes. The center hole has a plastic ring that is secured by tiny screws and the support legs in the middle are attached by little more than staples. The design shows promise but they need to add better materials to make this a solid item."
3,Beanbag Game,This is the second game I have owned. Had it shipped to my husband's office and brought to my Summer home in Maine. Right out of box it was broken and looked like it was used. Glued it and got it working. Disappointed!!
1,"Absolute peice of JUNK, DO NOT PURCHASE",constructed of particle board and no screws or nails. Just barely glued together. Ours fell apart during the first game. This is going back. Build one yourself. Save your money and frustration.
1,Very Regretful Purchase,"This set lasted less than two hours (of extremely moderate and typical use) before it was completely dismantled. The frame is held together with a terrible glue-job and the hardware is completely unstable. DO NOT PURCHASE. Now I have to deal with returning as defective and fronting the shipping cost for a fairly heavy item and file for reimbursement. Thanks, Chuck-O. It was a wonderfully frustrating two hours we spent together."
3,Chuck-O Pro,"The game is compact and comes in a great carry-case which makes it easy to transport. The bean bags are lightweight and not equal to the pound of corn found in regulation Corn Hole bags. The board is in need of a support piece to bridge the joint because it sags when playing. The board used to be produced with a support as shown in the picture, but the supports have been discontinued. Overall, the positives are the compactness & portability. The biggest negative is that the boards need support to keep them from sagging. We will be creating a support for our boards and have made canvas bags that are filled with corn so the game is more akin to Corn Hole."
3,Family Fun in and out of the Sun,"The first time I saw this type of game was on a cruise ship. I happened to notice how involved everyone got over a very simple game. I ordered it as soon as I got home and when it arrived it was a great reminder of the cruise ship without the waves. Talk about bringing a family together and then creating a havoc. What fierce competitors I live with. If its fun excitement drama and war you want this will do it. We use it often so the one complaint I do have is the paint doesn't wear to well. The other complaint is that an 8 year old can really make you look bad. This game is not as easy as it looks, and that is a good thing."
3,male bond,"As understood, post-WWII Japan was under the U.S. occupation filled with prosperity to move from ""feudalistic"" to the Western way of living as film's major characters, a TB-stricken yakuza-man and a sober GP exemplified.Upon decades seen, any-epoch-contemporary viewers can decide a degree these inspirations have been released in Japan-of-their-timings."
5,A Scathing Commentary,"Unsentimental, gripping morality tale of Japanese society after WW2. This is a simple story with the sharpness and balance of a finely crafted sword! Mifune and Shimura play off each other beautifully. Who is the drunken angel? We are told it is Shimura. But..... as Donald Richie says in his book on Kurosawa, Mifune is also an angel, though of a darker breed. Vivid images remain with you long after the film is over and respect for all those involved increases with each viewing!"
1,"A weak excuse for a karate book with ""Art"" in the title.","This book has absolutely no substance, just pictures. One could learn just about as much about stretching from a comic book. This book should be titled ""The Art Of Taking Blurry Pictures of Someone Who's Really Flexable"". I hesitate rating this 1 star."
2,"OK, good for begginers.","I would recomend this book for someone who wants to learn ""cool kicks"", and basically look like Jean Claude Van Dam. The book has very little text. It's devided into two sections: the first half is on stretches, and the second half is on kicking (big supprise, huh?). The stretches deal mostly with the legs and torso/back, which is OK, given that this is a book on kicks, and not punches. The section on kicks deals with a variety of kicks, from the basic to advanced, but most of it is high, flashy stuff that looks good in competitions. I'd say that the greatest benifit is that of health, or good form. Some of the kicks might be useful in point fighting. I know from experience that the stretches work, at least for me, so I wouldn't consider it a bad buy."
1,Not worth paying for.,This a short not a feature length film. This clip is available for free as a bonus with many Pixar DVDs. My kid was very bummed to figure that out.
2,great if its free... but $2.99 is a total ripoff for 5 mins of video.,great if its free... but $2.99 is a total ripoff for 5 mins of video.Note to self: read verbiage and don't be in such a hurry.
1,would be a cute short if it worked,"This video freezes up at the one minute mark everytime we try to watch it. If we fast forward about halfway in we can watch another 45 seconds then it freezes again. I have not had this problem with any other amazon movies, only this one."
1,Jack-Jack Attack- Runtime only 5 minutes,"This movie was selected by my 7 year old grandson. Because it ended so quick, I felt that there was an error related to playing it. I was very disappointed when I realized that we paid for something with this short of a runtime."
1,Just wrong,I thought I was buying a movie not a preview! Why would I spend money on a preview so disapointed.
1,poor sound quality,the cd is not worth [the price]. the vocals break up and the tape drags. the cd was made from a 20 year old amateurish tape and sounds like the quality of a worn cassete but it is clear. [....] if you can handle [inferior] sounding cds the content is good. i cant.
5,awesome tower!!,"this is a awesome little water tower,has an extremely bright flashing red light(almost a strobing effect!buy it!!"
1,Misleading label,"This is only Vol 1 and its appendices. And no, you can't tell that from the sample. Amazon needs to apply some discipline to the descriptions and metadata on re-publications of old multivolume public domain works. We shouldn't have to buy a pig-in-a-poke. It happens much too frequently."
5,A book for Coues Whitetail fans,"This book is well written, contains good histroical information of Arizona's early Coues studies,history of Fort Huachcuca wildlife programs and Fort management. Not a large book but an enjoyable read well worth the money and one of the few books written about the Coues deer. The author was the game management person at Fort Huachcuca for about seven years and during this time he consulted with Arizona Game and Fish biologist while setting up the game management for the fort."
2,could've been so much better,"I don't understand why they keep making these silly walking tall movies with little or no regard to Sheriff Buford Pusser, the real and only walking tall (HELLO)!!!!! Why can't someone just remake the REAL TRUE STORY of Sheriff Buford Pusser??????"
3,How to Double Decrease beret,"After hours of seeking help for the DD I have devised a solution for the BERET.At the second row of beret top SLIP the first black st to the right needle. That st has now become the end of the row so if you are using a marker move it over to the left of the slipped st.*K1 one st with wht yarn, K3 blk, K3 wht, K3 blk, K1 wht, K3 blk, K3 wht, K3 blk, K1 wht, slip next two sts (1blk & 1wht)from left needle to right needle knitwise, K1 wht st from the left needle to right then pass the 2 slipped sts over the one you just knitted. The center white st is ""raised"" of the 3 sts just worked. Repeat from the * to end of row.I write this because I consider myself to be an experienced Knitter and I love the book 45 FINE and FANCIFUL HATS but the Double Decrease description (or lack of) had me stumped. When I looked for help on online I could find so many complaints and so few solutions. Perhaps this will help the next person seeking to finish a beautiful hat."
4,Highly recommended if...,"-You love to work in the round in multiple colors-if you are looking to practice your fairisle technique on smallprojects-are comfortable working entirely from a chart-are happy to choose your own colors without any specificrecommendationsThese hats are sized to fit a medium adult woman, made on acircular size 7 or so needle with worsted weight yarn. Sizeadjustments are recommended by changing the size of yarn and/orneedles or for extremely large, adding repeats. The techniquesrequired aren't overly difficult- two color work, simple increases anddecreases. If you like Anna Zilboorg's other works, for exampleSimply Socks, do yourself a favor and buy this book!"
2,You'd better like fair isle knitting...,"I bought this book for its variety of hat shapes and was hoping to knit them in solid blocks of colour rather than in stranded fair isle. Zilboorg states that if you are going to knit these designs with one colour per row (rather than the two colours that are charted), you need to increase the number of rounds, however, she does not give the reader specific instructions or charts - not even a calculation - for how to do this."
3,***OUT OF THIS WORLD***,"THIS BOOK IS A BIT MUCH FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR BASIC PATTERNS. HOWEVER, FOR DESIGNS OUT OF THE ORDINARY, THIS BOOK IS A MUST HAVE."
3,Tibetan Incantations,"The cantations are ok, but over produced in Britain. It would have been nice to know that the CD came from Britain and not Tibet when purchasing."
2,One out of Three,"First two chants are too schmaltzy and ""Western"" to assist in meditation. The third chant however is good, the least embellished and helpful for meditation."
1,Don't Bother!,"I bought this CD with great expectations: I thought I would have some lovely mantra chanting to play throughout the day. NOT. All expectations were dashed - no, shattered. This CD is horribly New Age, with cloying instrumentals and silly chanting rhythms. It was a complete waste of money and a total embarrassment to play. I took a chance on this one, and lost. Bigtime. If you are interested in Tibetan Buddhist chanting, look elsewhere... preferably for something recorded by actual Tibetans."
1,New Age Pabalum,"I am sorry to go against the well-wishing reviews here, but I must agree with Zimra's disparaging review below.This is not authentic or traditional chanting at all. It is sickly sweet and unsubstantial New Age music meant to appeal to Pollyannas.I am a fan of more seriously original and innovative New Age music, and I continue to search for more authoritative and traditional chants.This CD, despite its evocative cover art, is not for those searching for what the Tibetan monks really sound like. There is far more candy here than earnest spirituality or respectable musicality."
1,Not at all Tibetan,"This disc is more of a Japanese pseudo-disco version of some distorted version of Tibetan Chants. Not at all what I expected. The subtitle ""The Meditative Sound Of Buddhist Chants"" is extremely misleading. Rather sleazy money grab from people who are looking for Tibetan music. A waste of money... If I wanted this type of music I would have ordered KC and the Sunshine Band sing Buddha Rocks..... I think you need to add a zero stars to your rating system."
5,Hypnotic and serene,"This is a beautiful CD and I recommend it for those who are Buddhist practioners, anyone with an interest in chanting the ""Om Mani Padme Hum"" mantra, or anyone who wants something soothing to play in the background. I promise though that no matter who you are, it's hard not to sing along eventually. The songs are long and repitious but here, that is a very good thing.I have read the other reviews and just want to add this. No, it's not Tibetan, in terms of style or singing, but the mantras are revered by Tibetans. Just don't go into this expecting monks chanting in the muti-tone deep manner. These are songs beautifully done, sung by a chorus of singers and that which is sung is beautiful in itself. While in Dharamsala, India for three weeks, I could not go a day without hearing one of these songs played in the streets. Check it out."
5,Very good album !,"The first time I have listened this music was in Nepal during an excursion for visiting the Budish temples in trip of dream and of a lot of amazing experiences. I was fascinated and like so many people we got only a bad copy of this album, anyway ...Thanks to AMAZON.co.uk I got a brand new album and I liste it once and once again. The melody is so calm and nice. Don't miss it !!"
2,ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENTS !!!???!!!!???,"I found this CD in the World Music section under TIBET. All I had to go on is the front and back cover information and photos. I bought it. As soon as I opened it and started to play it, something seemed seriously wrong. Sounds like New Age music. I looked at the booklet and what jumped out was ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENTS. OH NO! There is a disturbing lack of information on the performers or musicians. Are they monks? Are they even Tibetian? Where WAS this recorded? There is a photo of a monk but he is not identified. This is absolutely NOT what I was looking for. I feel like I was suckered into buying this. If I had only listened to samples of the music FIRST!"
5,Simply Sublime,"If you are reading this review then all I would say is just buy it. It's perhaps the best audio cd you will ever buy. I came across this while I was in a restaurant (Tashi Deleg) in Keylong, India where it was playing. I had to wait till I reached Leh to get this on audio tape way back in 2002 and ever since this has been my all time favorite meditation chant. Both Om mani padme hum, and avalokitesvara version have the best melody compare to any other version done so far. It's one of those CD you will never get tired of !"
4,Very Good Read,I found this book to be informative and insightful. It really helps you appreciate the developing personality of your little one and gives you some understanding as to what may account for changes in their temperament during this stage. I would gladly recommend this book to others.
4,OEM MTD 190-833 SNOW BLADE FOR CUB CADET LTX 1046,Got the snow plow in short time.Assembly was easy until I went to mount it on to the riding mower.Guess what NO FRAME BRAKETS wow I can't mount it without them.Found out that the FRAME BRAKETS don't come with the plow.Cost me a extra 23.00 for each FRAME BRAKET from MTD ( need 2 )would think that MTD would of inclued them in the box.Oh well just another speed bump in life from the great MTD.Now waiting for MTD to send me the FRAME BRAKETS for my Cub Cadetso I can mount the plow.Got to use the snow plow worked GREAT at plowing the snow we had around 4 inch of snow.Even wet melting snow was no trouble for it.BUT found that the plow SKID SHOES ware out fast.Have to replace them in just one month of using the plow.they should of been made from thicker steel or maybe harder steel.
1,dissapointing!!,"We bought this attachment for our lawn tractor. After the 3 hour installation complete with missing bolts, we attempted to plow our driveway in the first major snow storm of the year. Well, just like the review above...we should have bought a snow blower! The tractor is just not powerful enough to push all the snow. The tires, even with the wheel weights and snow chains kept on slipping & sliding. We ended up having a brick wall of packed snow at the end of our driveway, that we had to shovel anyway. We will be returning this and sticking to lawn mowing with our tractor! Dissapointing!!"
5,Snow Plow Blade for Lawn Tractor,"The product was well packaged and shipped promptly. However, the item had to be returned because it would not fit my 700 series lawn tractor. The web site stated it would fit all tractors while the box stated it would not fit 700 series machines, which it did not. The item was returned at Amazon's expense and their refund of my money was prompt. Overall, a smooth transaction."
2,Yep! Parts Were Missing!,"I bought this snowplow because I had one like it many years back. That old one pushed a lot of snow! I sold my old tractor and blade. I decided to get another one for my newer garden tractor. I read the reviews and noticed a few people said that their plows arrived short some parts. I bet against the odds and figured it wouldn't happen to me. Yep! Sure enough, mine was short parts, too! The parts bag was intact with no tears or openings. I was missing the blade return spring, a handle bolt & hitch pin, and a number of other hitch pins. I had to go to the hardware store and pick the parts up there. Right now, I have purchased about $15.00 worth of necessary parts! How hard can it be to count out a small list of parts correctly?"
5,Works great,Takes a while to install but we have been able to use our mower without removing the mowing deck. A much better value than a snowblower and less work.
2,Possibly good thinking obscured by poor writing,"I don't like to speak ill of persons who have passed on, especially since the picture on the cover makes it appear that the author was a kindly individual, but this book was very disappointing. The author apparently intends to provide insights into the dynamics of human consciousness and relationships, but his writing is so convoluted that I have great difficultly understanding any of the points he is trying to make. His writing is possibly the most obscure I have ever encountered, and I have 3 post graduate degrees. My view is that he didn't put enough effort into expressing himself clearly. Perhaps he felt that the subject matter was so hard to understand that folks reading his books would expect to have difficulty. However, the more difficult the subject matter, the more it is incumbent upon a writer to put effort into expressing his thoughts clearly and succinctly."
2,VB.Disappointed,This books stinks. It's just a rehash on vb.net. It hardly touches on MS Access and covers more on SQL. I've been waiting a long time for the book and am really disappointed. Good book if you need basic instuction on VB.net and database programming in general. Guess I need to wait until they come out with an advance version.
2,Microsoft writer Disappointing,Nothing about the MsAccess Promise.hardly touches MS Access. If you want to convert yourapplication find another solution.
1,Not a Good Book,Poor teaching style!Code does not work!Code not complete!poor reviews are deserved! find another book!
1,Not as Advertised,"I have been working in this profession for 30 years and have migrated from COBOL to VB-3, to VB-6, and now to VB.Net. The title of this book is ""Programming Microsoft Visual Basic.Net for Microsoft Access Databases.""When I started reading the book it began with very basic VB for the first 128 pages. Then once you do get into the VB sections of the book, there is a lot of repetition and not all of MS Access/VB programming is covered. Everything is done using embedded SQL commands. No raw access to MS Access. Try and find an INDEX change, or a SEEK command.Rick, you should publish a second book and finish the topic and send it to everyone who purchased this book free."
2,Don't buy it,It is sharp. It is cheap. But it is almost impossible to open with one hand. I was able to open few times with one hand but almost broke the skin on my thumb.So don't buy this one for a everyday carry knife. I own many knives by the way. Spyderco is the best but a little more expensive.
2,Beware the incompetent typesetting,"This otherwise lovely edition is marred by incompetent typesetting, where the typesetter has messed up the line-spacing, causing half of the Rubaiyat to be split across pages, which for me makes them unreadable. This is such an elementary mistake it takes the breath away. After the typesetter made that mistake, presumably an editor at some level approved it."
1,powdered sugar,"Thought I was getting something to serve as a breath mint equivalent. Instead these are mildly flavored powdered sugar that last a few seconds and do nothing more that give a sugar rush. I bought 3 flavors, a case each. Don't waste your money."
4,My favorite anime,"Vampire Hunter D, as you can tell by my title, is my favorite animated feature to come out of Japan. The storyline, as well as the atmoshphere, is rich and intriguing (the Castlevania games ""borrowed"" heavily from this movie.) My only gripe is that the animation is incredebily dark--making some scenes hard to make out (like when D falls into the catacombs,) so that's why I only gave it 4 stars. Be warned, though: there's blood, cursing, and nudity, so if you're offended by any of those, Vampire Hunter D won't be for you."
4,Better than the first...,"A much better movie than its predecessor, Vampire Hunter D.The backgrounds are beautifully done and the character animation is more fluid. The storyline flows better as well."
4,"Not quite 5 stars, but great nonetheless","Maybe it's just because of the fact that I am a spoiled , nineties anime fan who is used to much more fluid animation and epic stories, but I just don't enjoy this as much as some people do. It clearly looks dated, is what I mean.That being said, it is a classic anime film and very engaging. D has got to be one of the coolest anime characters around. One of the gripes I had, though, was that the whole romance between him and the girl seems very forced and unrealistic. Now I know what you're going to say. ""It's a vampire movie and you want realism!?"" I just couldn't feel any chemistry between the characters and it seemed like the relationship was just thoughtlessly thrown in there.Besides that, this features very interesting characters and is not to be missed by an Anime fan."
1,HIGH PRICE - LOW QUALITY,"Always liked this movie - it's a classic. Simplistic? Maybe, but it's entertaining, and you have to consider when it was made. What I DON'T like is this DVD transfer (""Special Edition"") - it's absolutely HORRIBLE! Half of the film is visually unreadable - and it's even more disappointing when you're waiting for great scenes that you remember and find that you can't even see them when they're on screen. No matter how I adjusted the picture, it was still a dismal mess. And the special features are anything but - doesn't come close to making up for the poor quality of the actual movie. In fact, clips of the movie that appear elsewhere on the DVD look better than the actual feature. This is one of the most expensive DVDs I've ever purchased and also one of the biggest wastes of money..... buyer beware."
4,Vampire Hunter D,"I don't review movies but after watching this one I'm compelled to applaud it for the great drama that it is. For those who love vampire movies, but care to see more sentimental and intellectual stimulation, this animation does the job well. Usually, I'm not a big fan of Japanese anime with its exaggerated features and lack of realism (both for the caricature of the personae as well as the backdrop), and my inclination would've been to give this movie three stars, but I've given it four because of its strength as a drama. First, there was Bram Stoker's Dracula, then Interview with the Vampire, and afterwards I'll rate this as my third most favorite vampire movie."
1,Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust,"When I first learned that this movie was coming out I was extremely happy. The trailer was cool, and I loved the original. But this movie was more cheese than I could hold down. I hated it. Spaceship Castle? Give me a break. If you loved the original VHD [though it is old, and a little cheesey it is all together more enjoyable for me] you my find yourself in horror as the plot to this unfolds. I suggest checking out something else."
2,Loved all but the end...,"I loved this movie, the intro, action sequences, story line, chareters etc. except for the end. I guess I'm the only one, but the end of this movie killed it for me. Granted, it did surprise me, and it was unexpected, but to me, it was INCREDIBLY weak. I mean, come on, why not waste Mier's a**? Letting him go?...please :-|. How non-dramatic could that get? I was just hoping the rocket would at least explode. Ohh well, sorry if you disagree, but the movie goes great right until the end. Also, the dvd does not include japanese dialogue, way to go numb-skulls. 2 stars for great action and animation, however the resolution, i just cant get over. P.S.- the original is way better, no comparison."
2,Neutral rating at best.,"Vampire Hunter D - Bloodlust will not win any awards. It is just another Japanese Anime that had its 3 seconds of glory and will fade away.Want to get your hands on some classy, collectible Japanese Anime? Get works by Miyazaki Hayao...This is truly for the kids. I have no clue why I bought this title on DVD."
1,worst anime movie i've ever seen,"I was going to make this review really long and just tear this film apart but instead I'll say it's an extremely poor example of a really great genre. Everything about this film is bad. The art, the story, the action scenes, there is nothing in this film worthy of even a rental. If you're in the mood for anime save your money and see 'Ghost in the Shell', 'Akira', 'Perfect Blue', 'Princess Mononoke', or 'Ninja Scroll'. Please do not see this film."
1,Vey bad in many complex ways,"Horrible, terrible and extrodinary crude and bad animation. It's also death boring and stupid plot, very stupid.TOO BAD"
2,Good Story.......That's all folks!!,"As the title of this review states `Good Story' and that's exactly what this movie represents, story telling and nothing more. The fighting scenes are very dramatic but far too short (they only last mere seconds). Don't purchase this movie if you are really into animation for the action (I am) and this movie almost has no action at ALL!. Again I will like to stress that the fighting scenes are too dramatic, the movie does not give you an opportunity to get into the action. You will see two people about to battle and just when you sit up to take in the full effect of what's about to take place one person just dies!! Just like that !! The movie was good but I bought this movie because I thought it would have been action packed so I am very disappointed."
3,The times they are a changing...,"While Vampire Hunter D may have been a masterpiece of its time I can't say it held up well. The idea is simple - 10,000 years into the future vampires, demons and mutants roam the Earth. So some humans became skilled hunters. Some hunt werewolves and some vampires.Vampire Hunter D is a vampire hunter. I don't wish to give too much of the story away but he is, surprise, surprise, not all that he seems to be.Kind of a mixture of Gothic horror and a dystopian setting it seems a tad too dark. I don't mean the setting as much as it is sometimes hard to follow what is going on when everybody is wearing black, when fighting at night, covered in black blood. We get to enjoy the early voice acting of such greats as Kirk Thornton, Steve Kramer and Barbara Goodson but that's about it.Get it used if you have to or rent it."
5,The single greatest Anime you will ever see.,"Way back in the days, before the Japanimation hit, I myself wouldn't have even bothered to watch one. One night my friend and I were rolling news papers when suddenly ""D"" came on TBS. For two hours Cam and I were awe struck. This movie has it all! Lies, Murder, Love. . . ""D"" is a nonstop thrill ride that keeps going even after the film itself ends. It also puts a new twist on the way you may look at vampires."
2,Boring like hell - slow like a snail.,"I am a casual anime fan. I like cartoons in general, and I love sci-fi. I've bought into `Vampire Hunter D' based on all those fantastic reviews. I was extremely disappointed. This is was the slowest anime I have ever watched. No thrills, no action, stupid dialogue, and no mystery at all. The story line was also very simple, and the heroes lacked dimensions. I bet the original comic book was much better than the movie. At least the graphics were true stills."
2,Weak,"give me a break people, this movie is weak. His hand talks to him. Wow. To all of you who rated this 5 stars, you probably like fist of the north star, too. Hell, you]re probably watching it right now. The only good thing about this movie is the cover. Please, people. Start with Akira. Well just keep this basic for you. That is a good anime example. There are others. Macross Plus. Ninja Scroll. Even Ghost in the Shell. You should be able to find these easily. Once you do, watch them and see how bad Vampire Hunter D is. Even if you love the company, get Darkside Blues instead. Now i'll write it in as big text as i can. VAMPIRE HUNTER D IS BAD ANIME. PLEASE, DISAGREE WITH ME. ESPECIALLY IF THE MOVIE IS ONE OF THE 5 ANIMES THAT YOU HAVE SEEN. Come talk with me when you people learn how to be a little more critical of what you watch. Until then, go watch Ishtar."
2,Had High hopes but over rated,"After all of my friends telling me how great this was I finally picked it up and watched it. It feel really sluggish and (yes I realize it is old) the animation seemed poor. Overall it was very boring, and left me disapointed."
2,Am I missing something?,"I had high expectations for this film after reading the reviews here and found myself very disappointed. I am not an anime fan per se, but absolutely love Cowboy Bebop and enjoy movies like Akira and Spirited Away.Although I found to plot weak and the animation unimpressive, my biggest complaint was that the voices didn't seem to fit the characters and it just seemed to be poor acting. In general, I found it more childish than I expected, despite the frequent violence.A lot of people seem to disagree with me and you might love it, but do yourself a favour and rent or borrow a copy before buying it."
5,the original movie,"This film is set 10,000 years in the future in the year 12,090 A.D. where a vampiric nobility terrorizes human peasents. A young girl, Doris Lang, is attacked by Count Magnus Lee, a powerful vampire said to be a 5000 or 10,000 years old. She hires a horsman D to protect her farm from vampires' predations."
3,Vampire Hunter D: Fanlust,"This movie was spectacular. The animation is crisp, and the backgrounds are very lush and eye-pleasing. I've found it difficult however to make out some dialogue due to the predominant background music (mainly D's parasyte, he's a low talker). The DVD doesn't have subtitles, I see this product as a rushed effort to keep foaming-from-the-mouth fans at bay and make some quick bucks. I can see within the next year or so a ""special edition"" coming with japanese audio and english sub. Even after that fact I don't regret the investment, and will gladly shell out for a ""special editon""."
2,Poor Anime Ruins an interesting idea.,"The premise was interesting, albeit far from original.In the far future, man has become disparate and are under the control of Vampires. It is a world of werewolves and other strange creatures.The local Baron is Count Magnus Lee and he has become enamored with a resident. He is bored and needs a little action. While having bitten the young woman, he sends her home, until the night he will marry her. Instead of accepting her fate, she hires a vampire hunter named D, who is a half vampire decendent of Count Dracula himself.The animation is weak, almost at the Ralph Bakshi level and the dubbing is poor. The characters are static and the action is fairly lame. It is gory but the movie is so weak that without the blood, the movie would have been a complete waste of time.If you like horror movies, try Devilman instead."
3,Great Animation But Lack Of Subbed Audio And Only Awful Dubbed Audio Hurts This Movie Greatly,"I actually had to order this movie overseas from one of the Asian market stores so I could get a subbed audio version rather then this awful atrocious dubbed version we're forced to hear. The animation is incredible and the overall story fits with the movie just like the first movie, but if you're expecting more new age fight scenes like with Trinity Blood or Hellsing you're going to be disappointed then. Again though I'd advise trying to get the subbed version of this movie as the terrible acting and awful timing of the dialogue just makes you wince sadly this happens primarily with the main cast characters which really hurts the enjoyment value of the movie even more(Comes as no surprise we haven't heard any of the actors/actresses on anymore anime movies or series luckily)."
5,One of the best all time classic.,"Vampire Hunter D is what made me a huge anime fan. This is one of the all time classic anime that will be around for a long time. It gives you that eerie feeling when you are watching this movie, with its gothic feel and horror style music. I have been waiting for this to come out on video, ever since they took it off the shelves. I've only seen this movie on TV and that did it for me. This is one of those anime movies that you just got to have in your collection, if your a O.G. anime fan. You can't go wrong with this movie. I just love this movie!"
5,"NO. 1 IN MY BOOK - AL THE TIME, EVERYTIME","""He Leaps, He Slices, He Slays, ..... VAMPIRE HUNTER D. RULES! This is by far, in my personal opinion the absolute finest anime movie I've ever had the pleasure of seeing! Anyone know of one better, either post a review or tell me!"
4,1985....,"OK, so this didn't have the greatest animation... it is from around 15 yearsago... you can't compare the animation of say... Evangelion of 1996, to a movie that was made about 11 years before it, its simply not fair to VHD.At times the story is a little slow moving, but you have to watch it to the end, the end is simply the best part of the movie.This is a classic, at its time, this had to be one of the best, and now everyone is spoiled by great anime such as evangelion and kenshin where the animation is amazing, and colors, and shading are perfect... you can't hold the animation against it... it still stands alone without it, and it was an outstanding dub... no stupid slang terms, or ghetto talk used... thank god.."
3,Vampire Hunter D,"Brahm Stokers and the likes of Anne Rice are considered among the top Vampire movies, too bad they over looked Vampire Hunter D because its Anime, action packed well preformed and equaly well written, this movie is among a favorite anime in my collection"
3,Mixing of the best of Anime,"The Vampire Hunter D world was brought visually to life using the best of Amano and Shiozawa. Although, the story may not be suitable for the main stream viewers. It collects many storylines from the manga to the screen in a way that much of the public will fail to connect. But this movie was made for the fans of D only. The 1980's vibe is felt in big waves. The music and the effects are all out left behind. But the story stands timeless. It is a must for Anime and Manga fans."
3,A very pretty movie,"Ok I just have to say this. My and my friend, we watched this movie with the sound off. And you know what? It was still very enjoyable. This movie is all about the art. The story is merely an excuse to have a dark, very badass anti-hero walk around acting like a badass in a visually interesting and pleasing environment. I didn't know until after I rented this movie that it only comes dubbed in English, and it really threw me off. I HATE dudding... which is why I had the sound off. The dubbing on this is about as good as can be expected, although of lesser quality than Princess MOnonoke or Akira. The dialogue is terrible and a bit confusing at times, and the plot... well the plot is basic and not terribly important. Rent this movie if you want to look at something pretty and nicely animated."
5,as good as you can expect,"let my start by saying that this is one of movies that everyone has to see, the movie was compared to ninja scroll more than once and with some justification. Again a fighter with unusual skills has to face evil in all of its forms.the story line is interesting and well made, there isn't a singel moment along the film in which one may feel bored and thats what makes this movie so good!the movie has some problems that cannot be ignored, the most disturbing one is that you don't really get to know the hero, how he thinks and all the interesting things relating to such unique character, he is always in distance.if you have any doubts about buying this movie, i say it as clear as i can: ""it is worth the money"".if you won't expect too much, you won't be disappointed.i hope this was useful."
3,"Meh, I wasn't that impressed","This is an ok sequel. I wasn't all that impressed with the story line, and the action sequences left a lot to be desired. It also felt like it lacked some of the grit of the original. This just feels like a watered down let's ride the coattails of the original and see who we can get to buy it. That being said it's still better than a lot of the junk out these days and it was watchable."
1,"Looks promising, but gives us little to nothing!","Bad anime...What was good about this movie:1. Excellent animation!2. Characters with such potential!What i didn't like:1. The plot was mostly a big chase!2. The dialogue/dubbing was bad!3. The character's potential was wasted!4. D overcomes almost every obstacle with his sword!5. The movie's plot was too video game-like!6. Too many parts of the movie were slowed down to tell back-stories!7. The score/music was loud and awful!Overall, this movie had so much potential to be so much more than it was! I was so disappointed, I wanted my money back!I didn't really like this movie!My grade; D- or one star!"
2,"Movie, dialogue, blah blah blah...","I could care less about how bad the dubbing was, or the plot (its a mindless fighting anime duh), or how lame it was that D just used his sword all the time....What pisses me off is the fact that A) ITS ONLY IN ENGLISH B)No subtitles C) No Japanese audio....W. T. F>?Why on earth would they leave out so much? It's like making a DVD today without anything other than the movie! There's no point. If I wanted only the movie I would just get it from the net.If you're ok with just English audio and aren't trying to study Japanese or want to hear the original voices, this is for you. I guess I didn't really think/read before buying this movie...oh well.2 stars for lack of everything a normal freaking anime DVD has...."
5,Vampire Hunter D,"I love this movie! It introduced me to anime, yet it remains my favorite one. I have four copies. A couple of them are messed up from constant viewing. It's that good!"
2,Weak,"He talks to his hand. The cover is the best part of this Piece of trash. I shudder to think of what else he uses his hand for. :o Watch something by Miyazaki instead, or good old Ninja Scroll or Akira. This one goes on the shelf with Fist of the North Star."
4,Over-hyped but defiantly worth seeing.,"Although I usually prefer to watch dubs so I don't have to read movies, I found the Japanese version to be much more entertaining. The English Dub seems very distant and almost boring. Luckily it is ""standard"" for anime DVD's to have both dubs and subs.Unless you are a collector of VH-D stuff there isn't really any good reason to buy this. However, it is defiantly worth seeing. Especially since the sequel is so good. If I had rented this or seen it on tv I probably wouldn't have bought it."
5,One of the best,"This is probably the best horror anime ever. The plot is tight and fast-moving, the characters well-rounded, and the animation is simply stunning.Dialogue is crisp and well-done, the voice acting is excellent, and the movie does a marvelous job of creating suspense."
4,geat anime,"very well done and excellent, over all. i may have missed an explaination of 2 characters but i enjoy the aspect of showing the time in which D has been in the world"
5,Really Good,"I havn't see Vampire Hunter D, but I recommend you not to buy it or perhaps you can rent it. I heard reviews that Vampire Hunter D blood lust was better than the first. I was astounded by this movie. The extras are really good,and this will show you where they officially done this movie at. This is a western movie, but there isn't no subtitles and japanese version of this movie included which I personally don't think this will affect the movie. One of the best titles I've seen."
5,BloodLust,"Vampire Hunter D: BloodLust is one of the best anime movies that I have ever seen. It has a great story, lots of action, and beautiful animation. If you loved the first Vampire Hunter D, then BloodLust is the anime for you."
1,Fool's Gold,"Although brimming with ideas this movie is so badly dated it's not funny.... Although D's character is suitably dark and well-realized, the monsters in the castle make you laugh, not shudder. This is not gold. This is old.Don't waste time and money on this sub-par fare. Instead, wait for the new Vampire Hunter D flick directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll). This version will not only prove to be an instant classic, as one can surmise from the awesome trailer, but will also readily condemn the original to the status of a cinematic has-been."
1,"Great idea, but abysmal animation","This was a very disappointing experience. Although the storyline is one that could have been turned into a great piece of anime, the simple fact is that you would be as well off quickly flipping through the pages of a comic book. The animation is unanimated, and dull looking beyond belief. The DVD presents a nice picture, but nothing that special, since the source material is not good to begin with. That the plot has so much potential, makes this an even more disappointing experience. Stick with the subtitles--the spoken English translation is not very good and the people doing the dubbing are a poor replacement for the original Japanese. I can only add that anime has come a long way since this was made, and anime shouldn't be judged on the basis of this very uninspiring visual experience."
1,Handy man,"To whoever thought that this was better than Darkside Blues and Ninja Scroll: You probably watch Star Trek. Darkside blues had an equally WEAK story, but infinately superior animation. And you think this is better than Ninja Scroll? I'm sure everybody out there agrees with you... (a smile followed by shouts of laughter) It's ok. I'm sure that once you watch a few more good examples of anime, then you will wake up. But take your time, we can all laugh at you in the meantime."
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The anime is very old and poor, story line is interesting, but it is done very poorly. I couldn't even finish watching this movie. I am so upset that I wasted my money on this piece of garbage. So if you are thinking of buying this film please DON'T! Please don't let my mistake be in vain. This film is CRAP!"
1,HOW? WHY?,"My only guess is that someone someone said it was a classic and everyone agreed as to prove they were ""true"" anime fans? I am a huge anime fan and all i can say is this is the WORST anime, hell, its the worst anything i have ever seen. I cannot put into words how bad this was. the animation- terrible, dialogue-my god....so stupid and cheesy. storyline- a joke. do yourself a favor, gauge out your eyes... and ear drums. before you put this one in."
2,Mediocre at Best,"Maybe I anticipated the release of Bloodlust too much or maybe I've just watched too many really good animations recently, which detracted from this movie. Most likely, it just wasn't that good. I was a big fan of the first VHD, but for a new movie that has had this much attention and praise I was quite disappointed. I'm not going to just give it a good score simply because of high hopes and respect for its predecessor. D didn't deliver the sword battles that can be found in Samurai X. The artwork wasn't sinister or gothic compared with Blood - The Last Vampire. The characters weren't nearly as well developed as those found in Ninja Scroll. After the dust settles and the hype moves on to a new movie, Bloodlust will be far removed from the status of ""an anime classic"" reserved for the likes of Akira and Ghost in the Shell. This move could've been much better than what's playing in movie theaters right now, but that's just my opinion."
5,This is the definitive vampire movie (until the remake) !,"I think the first time I saw this was when it was on TBS (TNT?). It's really too bad it's out of print. It has its moments, good and bad, but it's all worth it in the end. Low points: It has a tried-and-true story which can get a little cheesy, and the battle between D and Regensei has TERRIBLE theme music. Maybe the subtitled edition isn't at all cheesy, which is why I'm turning a blind eye and giving this otherwise excellent anime a great rating. It's a good rent for the meantime."
2,Masterpiece? Hardly...,"This is one that, like Fist of the North Star, most anime beginners like until they see more. The animation is quite stiff, and the plot and characters are just dull. I think it's certainly an interesting concept, having an anime based upon Dracula, but the final execution just was not very good. Basically, I've always felt it was lots of wasted potential - the underlying ideas of the movie are far better than anything actually in it."
3,I would skip this and watch the Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust....,"This was really boring and bad movie.. Plots are mundane and characters are flat. It try to have sex and violence but it is so overly done and not much of story that they almost seems comical (well depends on how you look at it, they may be seen differently).I gave three stars of animation and music attempts for the blood and gores. By the way, I think good horror movie does not have to show so much of sex and violence and get the job done."
2,vampire hunter,Not loving this very much. I bought it without looking at any reviews and wish I would have. It was a let down for me.
2,worse than i remembered,"i purchased this movie because i remembered watching it, way back in highschool, and loving it. i guess i remembered it being better--somehow reconstructing its animation and plot so that it seemed amazing.watching it again, however, was a monotonous experience. the plot--while promising--is ultimately flimsy, dull, and predictable. furthermore, the animation is pathetic. the movement and action is wooden and hundreds of frames are sorely lacking.i think most people like this movie because of the gore. hey, i like gore as much as the next person--but the lead up to the blood is boring: streaming backgrounds with still figures and other outdated, primitive animation techniques.furthermore, like lots of anime, the movie possesses lots of pointless nudity and scantily clad women: it's insultingly sexist. it was only worth watching for nostalgiac reasons."
1,"Great Premise, Worst Actual Story Ever","Thought I would try an anime to see what I missing out on, wow was this horrible. I think I and everybody else should sample the best of a medium. I get that this isn't in that number, but again wow. The mentality of someone that could enjoy this boggles my mind. I'll try Ninja Scroll and if the story development is as offensive I'm checking out. This makes X-Men 3 seem reasonable."
3,"beautiful indeed, but little more than that","Aesthetically amazing. Very beautiful gothic-style art. Fairly good dubbing.The storyline however, is not extremely boring, but definitely nowhere near anything interesting. In truth, I believe everyone who thinks this movie was more than decent would not have, had the movie been animated as averagely as the storyline itself. Eye candy truelly often blinds persons from recognition of true perfection. Just about everyone likes this movie though, so be like them all,VHD 1 = superior"
3,"2 stars for graphics, 1 star for plot.","I have to say that the graphics were extreme! I loved watching D's entrance! However, I am not so easy to please. I need a plot as well. Here I was disappointed. You can tell americans wrote this story. The plot was very weak and did not even come close to doing justice to 'Vampire Hunter D'. Hey, but the graphics were good...right?"
2,Violence with little else beyond that!,Now The movie definately was violent and for that I enjoyed it but otherwise I did not find anything origanal or likable about it. Not to mention so many things make zero sense. Why do they ride robotic horses when they could drive a car or something sense they obviously have the technology? Why do they use melee weapons save the appearance of 3 guns when houses are protected by laser defence grids? I addition they had to some how tie the storyline to count Dracuala which I found unoriginal. The western theme just did not work for me either. I guess if your really into violence and do not care for much else you would be a big fan of this movie.
3,Blood & Guts,"Why is Vampire Hunter D, a more or less avrage anime considered a classic? Dose it have a great plot? Well developed charecters? Err... no ~_~. An anime that is most often watched by students looking for gore and buckets of blood, plus a crazy monster or two. The protagonist, ""D"" has little intesting to tell the viewer, and the antagonist, an old, old vampire with a fetish for humans is just boring. The stars come from the art, the dark feel of the anime and the supporting charecters, who more or less steal the show. Style is what ""Vampire Hunter D"" has. Yes, it has some problems, and the story alone can keep this from repeated viewings, but it has a little charm under it all. No ""Classic"", but of you like your anime dark and violent, D is worth the cash."
5,This a Classic and great anime,"First of all to all those one star people how dare you this anime was around long before one such as akira, macross, or ninja scroll not that ninja scroll or macross are bad infact they are very very good can't say the same for akira but that is a different review, The gothic style and scripting are what personally intregied me and gave me reason more anime granted i was in fourth grade when i saw it. However, that was six years ago and I've seen lots and lots of anime most of which cannot even be rated same categoricly speaking. Now i'm not saying it's the best but it's in the 97 percentile of all anime. (Mr. Wang)"
5,Greatest Anime Story Ever,"Although some other reviews have responded negatively about this movie, including one person very recently who said everyone should watch ninja scroll instead, this is only because he wasn't able to appreciate the deeper meaning of VhD... D(the main character, duh!) represents the duality of man, on one end, he's your average ""oh, let's rid of the evil of the world, and rescue the damsel in distress!"" hero type, but on the other, he is a beast. D must continuely battle not only the evil outside, but also within, as he struggles against dark, bestial desires. Some of the other characters also represent elements of humanity, the count for example represents evil, and lust, whereas his daughter represents arrogance, and pride.All in all, it's an enjoyable romp for the intelligent viewer, and I recommend it to everyone."
4,"Good, But not Great","This anime lacks one thing: a good fight-action sequence at the very end. In the traditional stories of good vs. evil, this anime's ending leaves much to be desired in terms of a final show-down. I don't want to give away the ending (it is a good movie, and I recommend it), but I think you'll see what I'm talking about after you watch it."
5,Classic,"Vampire Hunter D is one of my favorite stories of all time. I first discovered it back when I was 14, and I just fell in love with the character. So glad they brought this to DVD!! The DVD itself is really good quality, considering how old the original film is. My only complaint is that I find the English voice acting to be annoying on everyone except for D. Totally prefer the subtitled!"
5,Awesome,"I've always been a big fan of anime, and its somehow the allure of ""vampire'y"" themes that make such titles interesting. Many fail to live up to the hype, such as the original Vampire Hunter D in my opinion, but this one is just awesome. There's something about D's taciturn nature, and how Meier Link is evil, or is he? Nothing profound in plot, but the action is fast-moving, and if you think hard enough, the usual philosophical themes in almost any anime is there. Excellent anime for the general public, if you don't mind the gore."
4,Very very very good,"Artwork an animation is excellent, and the dialog is surprisngly very well done for an anime. My only complaint is I felt the story wasn't developed enough, it seemed to move to fast, and that the movie was based around the fight scenes. But hey, with fight scenes like these, thats not too big of a complaint. If you want a stronger and more developed story, get the first Vampire Hunter D movie. If you want better art and animation, get Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust."
3,Vampire Hunter D Good animation bad Transfer.,"I watched the VHS version of this animation years ago and thought it was good.Now i have it on Dvd and i have this to say "" oh man what a pile of rubbish ""i can not believe the picture is so low,you can not even see the background or the animation.Most of the time i am adjusting the brightness of the TV.Regardless of other reviewers i would like to warn you of : the picure is very low standard for a dvd.It just goes to show you that the manufacturers are out there ready to con us.An animtion last from 35 mins upto 4 hrs and we expect it to be the best quality in sound and picture....but how wrong are we """""" what do they give us......LOW,BAD and Unwatchable Films on Dvd """"""Last word : Vampire Hunter D could have been the best but there is 2 many blured scenes in it. B warned."
5,VAMPIRE HUNTER D KICKS ASS!!!!!!,"IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.LOTS OF CKICKS LOTS OF BLOOD AND A HELL OF A LOT OF VIOLENCE. ONCE AGAIN ""VAMPIRE HUNTER D KICKS ASS!!!"" FROM YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD PHYCHO ""SLAYER"""
5,better than it deserves to be,"first off i want to stay that i HATE vampire hunter d. the original that is. i saw it once a few years back and thought it was the most worthless piece of trash i'd seen this side of dragonball z. i still do. so going into this i already had some preconcieved notions about how assy this would be.the opening scenes just floored me. the animation is second only to akira, and its a close second. the characters, even the secondary characters like the marcus brothers, are spectacularly designed and have great personality. the plot, while on the surface may seem very standard fare, is done delicately and with enough pinache to absorb a casual viewer.the action scenes are top-notch. the music is awesome.the ONLY downer to the movie is the main character, who through most of the movie just sorta sits there. as boring and mannequin-ish as he is they did a pretty noble job of giving him some personality. if you dont believe me just watch the closing scene."
4,Go with Bloodlust!!,"I started off my Vampire Hunter D collection with Bloodlust (the more recent sequel to this movie) and then eventually got around to renting this one. The story, characters, and animation in Bloodlust are far superior so if you are opting for just one of the VHD films, go with that. In all fairness though, compared to other movies that 1985 dished up, this one is very watchable."
2,where is the japanese w/ subtitles version?!?!?!,"Ok, I saw this movie when it was out in theatres and it was amazing! Unfortunately for me, it was english dubbed (which I hate) so when the dvd finally was released I bought it, especially for the fact that I would be able to watch it in its original japanese language format! However, to my disappointment, IT HAS NONE ON THE DVD! They acctually released the dvd, with only the dubbed version in it!! The special features also are terrible...this ""fan's favorite scenes"" feature is completely useless and even dumb.Therefore, for the anime itself, I would give it 5 stars, its a great movie, but if you're like me and hate english dubbed versions and expect more from your dvds, I give this dvd a mere 2 stars and suggest that you rent it or borrow it from someone else (or if you can, find a japanese dvd with subtitles with your region encoding)."
1,No Japanese,"It is disappointing to find that this DVD doesn't have Japanese dialogue setting. English voice actors for Anime are [bad]. I always hear similar voice like Goku(Dragon Ball)from all the animes, or either they all scream in the scene. Can't they afford much better voice actors?"
1,Great Anime - Crap DVD ed...,very good movie - 4 stars!but this us edition only contains the english dub!!!(and got very poor picture quality...)
4,Worthy Sequel to the old Vampire Hunter D,"Well, to make it short this Movie has it all. Bloody action, little humor ( some of it quite dark ) and a love Story.It features even some of the coolest Animation I've ever seen !!But there is only one thing with the 5.1 sound on the DVD I found a little anoying.They pretty much f...ked up the whole sound settings.At first I thought it was just my Sony DD Receiver messing it up. But when I got my new Harman/Kardon 3500 AVR I noticed it really was the DVD Sound !! Well, ok it's not too bad. But it's pretty dumb to pump the db's into effects and quite too little for the dialogs comming up front !That's why I can give this cool Anime only 4 Stars !"
5,This Anime totally Kicks!,This is one of the greatest anime movies I have ever seen! The animation isn't as good as some but the storyline definitly ranks high amongst the storyplots of the other anime pieces I've viewed. I recommend this movie to all anime fans and vampire movie fanatics.. I think it's one anime almost everyone will enjoy.
5,Fantastic,"If you are into anime and vampires than Bloodlust is a MUST HAVE. This is something you will want to watch over and over again. This is a movie you don't want to end.*slight spoiler warning*Unlike in other vampire movies, this one has a twist. The vampire that steals the girl actually loves her.****The action, the passion, the comedy. It is all there; Bloodlust has the whole package. You will not be disapointed.If I had to criticise the movie it would be that there is no part two or that it is not twice as long. Seriously, this movie is that good.I'll be buying another since I lost the last one I had."
1,They call this anime?,"What a horrible waste of time and money. Vampire Hunter D has to be one of the worst animes i have ever encountered. With such a poor plot, lifeless characters, and low budget animation, this movie is an insult to any viewer's intelligence. I dont claim to be a connossieur of anime, but even to the anime novice this movie is severely lacking. Not entertaining in the least bit. I thought it would never end. My strong disappoinment prompted me to write this, my first review ever. I am ranking this movie one star because half a star is not an option."
1,Boring and childish,"I bought this dvd because people are raving how good it is,IT IS NOT, this Animated cartoon first starts off as maybe something good but it ends very fast to a childish transformer like cartoon with goofy cartoon characters of the future with antics like the Kimba cartoons or childish Saturday cartoons your kids would watch but you will dread, this is pure kids stuff only I hope to sell my copy soon on ebay."
1,Bleh,"Funny how the cover has nothign to do with the feeling of the movie. I know it was done like 18 years ago, but the color scheme is aqua,pink,navy,black,white, etc very dull, the characters look like they have been drawn by a kindergarden class, and the story isn't that interesting, honestly i got through half of it, and turned it off. I couldnt even finish the movie!Watching this, all i could recomend is sticking to cheesy cartoons on tv, because they are highly more superiour to this. And not to mention the dialogue is beyond histerical.Rent if you must, then return it fast."
1,D looks like Boy George gone goth.,"(...) I don't care how much effort they put into drawing those vampire castles, because in the end it's a lot of static, 2 dimensional scrolled images. There was hardly anything 3D and cinematic about it at all, definitely nothing close to Akira or Ghost in the Shell. The first third of it was entertaining, but I expected a much darker, more advanced animation style, especially considering how they were supposed to be using state of the art computers for it. It appears they used the computers simply for speeding up the animation and layering the sprites. The biggest problem I had with the new D film was the lack of game rules on how the vampires can be killed. By the end, the same entities keep coming back to life, seemingly at the whim of the film's creators. Without rules, a film becomes a pointless exercise. I just wanted someone to die for good and the credits to start rolling."
3,Definitely not as good as the original...,I was hoping for more of the old stuff but this movie takes D into a slightly off direction from where he was in the original movie. Instead of the silent hero D is transformed into a mercenary who is only a shadow of his original character. Maybe I am being harsh but I was hoping for something a lot more than I got...
3,Wooden voice acting,"Why is every English version of Anime so terrible? On this one - you have no choice but to listen to the English speaking actors - and hoo are they stiff.The animation is great, the story's a snoozer, and the voice-acting terrible. Rent it first."
1,This is the best,"(ha ha) example of bad animation that there is besides Fist of the north star. Suprisingly, they have the same director. This one had a great hook, but was executed very poorly, and never got off the ground. Besides, it is cheezy as all hell if you want the blunt opinion. Save your money."
3,not that great,No Ninja Scroll.the Talking hand was anoying and never explained. if your a junky go for it. if you just getting into anime like me than get ninja scroll or ghost in the shell. Feel free to contact me if you dissagree
2,Old animation with generic storyline,"Story: generic good-vs-evil, feeling love but can't love, macho and cool warrier must move on after saving a girl he already had feeling to.......I don't mind this kind of old story, but the scenes are not really grapping or touching, and the drawing is retro, similar to animation style 20 years ago, colors are not well defined, layers not detailed, but in the end it's the common storyline not well directed that leaves one hoping for more actions, more emotion, and more ways this kind of story can be told and filmed"
5,Which D is better?,"I just watched this DVD this weekend, and let me tell you that I was blown away. I have the first D movie, and I can't decide which is better.I got to say the animation quality on this movie was amazing. A giant leap from the first. The story is great. Sound is much improved over the first. The voice dubbing is good. D's voice fits him nicely. It was less gory than the first movie which is good in my book.D makes a great dark, silent hero. You should see the scene where he catches a flying quarrel. Sort of Batman with a sword (and I mean the dark knight Batman, not the 60's Batman in thights, the horror).If you like action anime with dark atmosphere, this is a must have."
5,The best anime ever,"I saw this movie in the theater (Shocking!). It was sooooo good. The first movie was a bit goofy but this one was great. The plot, the Bishies, the coolness. I would sugest it to any one and every one!"
3,Odd anime has good moments...,"To be fair, ""Vampire Hunter D"" held my interest, but I wasn't necessarily wowed by it. It tells the story of D, a vampire hunter in a future far from now. D is hired by a young woman to kill a powerful vampire. What ensues is blood and guts, as D fights not only the demons of this lost world, but also the demons inside of him. The animation is very dark and not always at exotic as some anime is. The voice dubbing in this movie also leaves much to be desired. But there's enough violence to please fans of the genre, which I guess is good enough for most people."
4,one of the best Anime action flicks of all time,"The ink alone is worth the time spend watching this. By that I mean the art. The manga that inspired it is one of the more artistic and gorgeous mangas even inked. It translated well, even if the characters are a little 1 dimentional. The point is the action and the powers that clash. Very well done.Quote of the Day: He who overcomes others is strong, he who overcomes himself is mighty. Tso Proverb"
5,One of the Greatest Japanese Anime,"I grew up with some of the greatest anime movies and series, such as Macross, Ninja Scroll, Area-88 (not the remake), Akira, Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Ghost in the Shell (movie, not the series), and I have just recently watched this awesome re-telling of VHD. This has some of the best animations and coolest action scenes ever. The colors are very vibrant for a supposedly dark-themed setting, great orchestral soundtrack, and really poweful scenes--whether it's about society's views of monstrousity/discrimination or the (predictable) tragic love story. Plus, the inclusion of computer graphics blend very well with the silky-smooth painstakingly hand-drawn characters. Yet, it manages to be funny and not overblow its delivery--which has made D's character not as a loathsome and tragic misanthrope. After watching some clips in Youtube, I had to hunt down (sorry, no pun intended) for a copy at a reasonable price here in Amazon.com."
3,A stable and solid release from Omar & The Howlers,"One might wonder what Omar & The Howlers (i.e Ken Dykes) want with this release because most of the tracks are already recorded and released earlier. The only (artistic) reason would be that Omar have changed his opinion about how some previously released songs would be arranged, and now wants to set the record straight. Even if some songs sounds a bit different from the original versions it's not obvious that these new recordings are better versions. Omar have also decided to cover Mountain's ""Mississippi queen"", but I believe that this slower version doesn't add anything special to the otherwise great track. This album is of course worth having, either you're a big time fan of Omar & The Howlers or just a blues lover who's seeking an introduction to this band."
4,Bender rocks!,"Bender is really cool and makes a great desk toy...the only problem was that his cigar was not in the package. He did have his beer can, but how can you expect him to drink beer without a cigar?"
4,Great Collector's Item,I bought this wind-up for my brother who is a huge Futurama fan. It looks great on his shelf. I wouldn't really recommend this as a toy though. I don't see it being very durable.
4,Good as Display,This Item is good for a collector. The hand crank was difficult to turn and felt like the key might break.
3,Fun collectable,Anyone who loved the show will definitely be please with the toy. It is fun to see it walk across the desk. Although it is quite delicate and must not be over wound or played with by small children.
3,Not earth-shaking . . .,"This is a 46-page introductory book for kids. There is nothing earth-shaking in it. This might still be a good book to show children who are curious about judo.For young students, I recommend the Janicot book (See my other reviews, or just search ""Janicot Judo."")"
4,Pretty Good so far,"This PC is first I've ever bought and owned but I've used many over the years. Its got a decent speed with normal tasks and gaming. One thing I noticed is that its not much of a difference in the smoothness of games with the athlon 64 chip and this graphics card from other machines. I installed diablo2 and sometimes have slowdown and glitchiness. I thought that this was where the difference would be.Other than that its got a good price, big hard drive, and comes with one of the sh*ttiest software bundles I've ever seen. I mean come on,...no microsoft office?? The most basic and popular of all modern computing and I get a 60 day trail version? Not to mention that this ESSENTIAL program that should be bundled with your OS is about 450$ to buy separately. So if you are going to buy this pc, please already have friends with office that you can ""use""."
4,Devotionals for Quilters,"Short inspiring stories from fellow quilters are each followed by:1. Quilting Frame - the lesson, moral-like2. God's Template - scripture verse3. The Binding Stitch - prayer4. Scrap Bag - applicationSome stories are common to all of us, some extraordinary. A good devotional to have if you love quilts or quilting."
2,very yellow pages,"I bought this book under the condition that it said gently used and when i recieved it, the pages were very yellow."
3,Okay,It was the correct book but was completely different from what was pictured. That is a down fall to internet shopping that should no longer exist.
2,it was an ok book because it started off slow.,I wasn't to thrilled with the book when I started reading it but as it went on I started to enjoy it. It just took a lot of energy for me to get into the book during the first couple of sections. I would never read the book again but I'm glad that I read it.
3,Classic Novel / Lots of Typos,"I'm enjoying the novel, but have noticed quite a few typos, missing periods, etc. I don't know if it was just transferred to the electronic version sloppily, or if the print edition had the same errors."
5,Powerful and thought provoking!,"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is a brilliantly narrated book that describes an era in our history with a magnificent truthfulness. It is a very deep story riddled with symbolism and double meanings. The characters are beautifully portrayed by showing both their weaknesses and stregnths. One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is not only the tale of a group of mental patients, but also describes human nature and what lies in all of us. A brilliant novel."
5,What a great book,"This is one of the most enjoyable stories I've ever read. The characters are so full of life, and the narration is exceptional. Kesey does an incredible job of fleshing out RPM; it's one of the few times where I've felt that I had a full view of a literary character. I recommend not even seeing the movie. I watched it after reading this and was quite annoyed, especially with the emphasis the film put on the boating trip - zzzzz..."
3,My Review!,I thought this was a very good book when I first read it and I enjoyed it a lot but then I started wondering about some things. Like why are all the hospital staff either women or black and the patients all white males? What was he trying to say with that? The doctors a white male but you get the feeling that there are similarities between him and the patients and that he can sympasize with them. I suppose I'll just have to read it again though.
3,Ok,"I was expecting a little more from this book. I found it hard to follow at times but overall I did like it. In my opinion, the movie is much better."
3,...yeh,"Well from what I actually read from the book, it was pretty slow. The whole beginning was boring and it took a long time for things to actually get moving in the story. From 150 or so and up, it gets more interesting because the chief talks and the Nurse starts to crack. I was mad that the Nurse was so uptight about the patient watching the world series. It was only for a few hours for about a week and that was it. That made me mad but overall, I guess the book was decent. It just needs to start faster and things need to happen without so much description."
3,"Pretty good ,but not as good as reviews lead one to believe","This book was for the most part pretty good, however, I was still a bit disappointed in it. Having read some of the reviews on this board I was expecting more from the book. But it just never pulled me in until the end. There were some good parts, but for the most part I would say it was just an average read that I was glad to have over so I could start on something else."
4,One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,"I enjoyed this book very much. It gave a wonderful yet somewhat depressing look into the lives of mental patients during the sixties. It also showed how rebellion only got you deeper into the hand's of the government. Through the main character's eyes, you got to know and maybe even understand each and every one of these patients on a different level of intensity. Some made it passed the system and others did not. I would recommend this book to anyone."
4,"Good, but i [prefer the movie","This is a good read, and its fun to see everything through the eyes of the chief, but Cucoo's nest is one of my favorite movies, and i prefer watching this then reading it. Kesey was a great author, and gthe book is good, it just isn't as good as Jack Nicolson."
4,Leslie PRGimm,"Aren't we all insane? To me labeling something as ""sane"" is a waste of breath. The entire world and every being in it has same crazy truth hidden by layers of ""normalcy."" We judge those who are insane because we do not want to see the human spirit unmasked. Nurse Ratchet has worked tersely to recover those who have removed society's bindings of normal. I really liked this novel but it was more the ideas that it questioned that I enjoyed than the actual writing.I envy Mac Murphy for his bravery and confidence to challenge authority. I wish I had the audacity to do the same, to pull back my veil and reveal my true insanity. Overall I think this novel deserves praise for its own audacity and ability to challenge literary normalcy."
4,One Review Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"In the beginning, I didn't like this book.It made the work of psychiatrists look like horror, rather than help. However, once I was able to get passed the miscalcuations of what psychiatrists did in the book, I really enjoyed it. I especially liked the end, but I won't give anything away! It is a delightful commentary on some different philosophies of life. It also made me want to make a difference in the world, the way McMurphy made a difference for those men."
4,A perceptive and original take on mental health and institutionalization,"I saw the film adaptation of this novel before reading the book; I wish I had had a chance to read the book prior to watching the movie! It was quite different than the film interpretation, and a vision of Jack Nicholson as McMurphy kept creeping into my head as I read the book! Overall, I felt Kesey's novel had really original take on mental health and institutionalization. I liked that it was told from the point of view of the Chief (one of the patients)...seemed very authentic. Although it was gritty and the ending was hard-to-take, I really was impressed by this novel."
5,haven't read since h.s.,"okay ... I haven't read this book since high school, about 5 years ago. I remember enjoying reading the parts where the cheif is having his psychotic breaks. There was one passage where he's cleaning a wall and imagining that he's whiping sludge and slime off of it. I've never tried getting baked and writing down everything that comes into my head ... but if I did, I'm sure it would be interesting to read later. This book was like getting an inside glimpse of what it's like to be insane. I thought it was awsome and would love to read it again. I'm sure it'll bring up bad memories of homework and worksheets but I'll give it a try. Like I said, I haven't read it in a while so I don't remember what the underlying theme is. I do remember relaing to the patients and the way they viewed the staff, like they were otherworldly or something. If you think my review is stupid it's cool ... I'm no intellectual but I did appreciate this particular book."
5,An undeniably intense experience of human psychosis,"I found this book so intriguing from the moment I picked it up. It held my attention from beginning to end. Although I found some of it hilarious, other parts completely shocked me. The ESt given to Mcmurphy and other patients, the pure hypocrisy of the treatment of the so called ""insane"". This book not only tells the plot from the eyes of a so called lunatic, but makes the reader wonder how insanity can possibly be defined. Who's to say that one man is any crazier than the next. The paradox of giving a man EST so he is a brainless vegetable, just so he no longer exemplifies characteristics that society deams ""not normal behaivor"" was very frightening. The end shocked me, but was very fitting to the novel. Kesey is an amazing writer who has sustained the test of time. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a laugh and needing some intellectual stimulation"
5,He makes the Cheif big and he makes all of us big,"The perfect metaphor for school, or work and the handbook for any revolutionary. What can I say about such a good book except for what it has meant to me. R.P. McMurphy dies for all of them and all of us. He makes the Cheif big and he makes all of us big, and I spent my life feeling just like that locked in a system inescapable and hopeless, so powerful that resisting is foolish, but resistance is the only option, because they don't only want your body in chains, but they want your mind, and to stop resisting would be to give them your soul. I think of McMurphy when I'm at a seminar, or driver's education class, or anywhere with bad florescent light and dirty chairs, or when I'm playing poker.Peace,Jacques Paisner, Author of Albuquerque Blues"
5,The best read ever,This book entertains educates and generally keeps the reader interested to the very last page.A thoroughly enjoyable read. Reccomended to all
5,Good quality,"I had to buy this book for a summer homework assignment for Honors English. First of all, the quality of the book for being used was outstanding. You might as well call it new. The book over all was a great book and I am a person who does not like to read at all... I'd recomend this book to anyone who is looking to read about interesting characters. While your at it, might as well watch the movie!"
5,DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER,When I read this in 7th grade I didn't fully inertpret and appreciate this book's message. Ever since I have re-read the book it has been my favorite book of all time.
5,As Mick Foley would say it is truly the greatest book.......,...for all Mankind. A psyco's dreambook. This one will keep you warm on those really cold nights when your cardboard box doesn't hold up.
4,It was a great book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. The ending was the best. I would of never read it on my own, but over all it was great!"
4,Worth Reading,"The book always keeps you guessing, when you think something is going to happen the opposite does. You can never put it down you always want to know what will happen. I recommend this book to anybody. The book shows stregnth of caracter and courage. The ending might through you off but it couldn't be anyother way. If you are looking for a good book to read read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."
4,Mc Murphy's code of ethics,"Because this book is discriptive it can seem slow moving, but when it gets to the action parts, it becomes more interesting. the second half of the book is the most interesting, it has a lot of unexpected twists near the end. so try not to fall asleep before you get to them!"
2,The Nest,"I honestly didn't think the book was good at all. From now on I will not start reading any book that was wrote by an auther on drugs. The beginning of the book was very hard to understand and it couldn't keep my attention. I started liking the book when McMurphy was trying to get the nurse to let them watch the world series and she wouldn't, so then he punched a window out. Its really hard to understand why some of the patients are actually in the institution, because they don't have to be. Like Harding he has succeded on the outside life, because he has a good looking wife, even though she might have been the reason he is in there. I just mean that he can live out there by himself, and not be in the institution. I don't recommed this book because it is hard to follow, and wasnt that interesting."
2,Definitely not the best book I've ever read!,I found that I could not really ever get into this book. It took about 5/6 of the book before I actually started to get a bit interested. I did like the rowdiness of McMurphy and how he shook up things but I do not necessarily suggest this book to anyone.
2,Wrong Item,"The item was listed as the Spanish edition, but the book is in English. I was sent the wrong item or it was listed incorrectly- I asked the seller why but did not get an answer. The seller did, however, refund my money- so thanks."
5,great book,Excellent book - one of those classics that's very readable. Everyone can and should read this book.
4,Cuckoo,"This was a good book but the end seemed rushed. It was neat how the Chief narrated, and because he was a permanent inmate in the hospital, he was very insane. It's written in a phycadelic manner because he has so many hallucinations. The part about Santa Claus made no sense though."
4,Read the book first THEN watch the film,"I watched the film years ago, it was compelling and memorable - a brilliant story. Then i found the book at an airport - i thought i should read it. The book, (I dread to comment in this way) was as good as the film. It was well written, the characters well formed, the narrative well balanced, in fact as good a book as any. HOWEVER my opinion i think was jilted because i had the images of the actors in the film in my head as i read the book. How could anyone forget the contorted face of Nurse Ratched and the idiot smile of b b b b b billy from the film? I hope everyone will pay their respect to the writer and read the book first. It is a great book and should be enjoyed for itself. That the film was just as good, may mean that One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest will never reach outside a generation of readers, in the same way that Catch 22 will (although that made a great film as well). Buy this book and ENJOY."
4,Awareness,"I started this book having to work hard to understand what was going on, but as the plot and character development progressed, I found that it was not just because I had my head stuck in summer break- the transitions that the narrator swings through in tense, place and time do wonders for the reader to understand the process that Bromden is going through. They start in a place where his thoughts and analyzations of his surroundings are so removed from reality that the reader has to trudge through pages, maybe even rereading a few, to get at what he is actually seeing. That was overall my favorite aspect of this book, seeing Bromden became more and more aware and interactive with his environment and friends through his own admission of it as well as the literary style involved in his metamorphosis."
3,One Flew over The Cuckoo's Nest Review,It was a very good nice book. I like very much. Make me happy and smile and nice attitude. I order everytim and make me happy.
4,Life.,"Punching against the mechanical & soulless white walls Kesey presents Randall Patrick McMurphy to existences dramatic sway.The group of characters are real,& the unforgettable nurse painfully so.Though the novel is pretty slow & uncompelling at the start,& McMurphy more of a shadow than the central being that he's supposed to be(its the supporting characters that shine),Kesey goes on to show,to dramatic final effect,the situations in life's scenarios;its moods,dreams,illusions,limitations,& final twists of fate which lead to it's unpredictable outcomes."
4,One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,"The book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest written by Ken Kesey, is a entertaining yet disturbing novel. I think the theme of this book is men create their own prisons. The main character of this novel is Randle McMurphy, who ends up to be a hero in the patients' eyes. Nurse Ratched is the conflict in this story. Nurse Ratched controls everything the patients think and do. At the end of this novel one of the characters overcomes her. I hope this review persuades you to read this book."
4,"4.5, good","Don't watch the movie before you read the book! This book has a little bit of everything in it and it's funny, catchy and crazy all at the same time. I'm not going to describe the plot like everyone else, just read this. It takes hardly any time to read but it's a great book and the author describes things very well. Make sure you know what all the words mean (ie. the diagnoses, etc) before you read though!"
4,Let the Milos Forman and Jack Nicholson entertain you.,"I first watched the movie, then read the novel. With respect, I enjoyed the movie much more than the book. Milos Forman (The director of ""One flew over the cukoo's nest."") made the movie magical and as entertaining as it can ever get. However, the book is filled with deeper details and themes. In the book, Chief bromden is describing Mcmurphy's behavior and in the movie, we see in perspective of the patience. Either way, it's a masterpiece. I would definitely recommend you with the movie rather than reading the novel in this particular case. I know that some books are far better than the movies but this one is different. Jack Nicholson and the rest of the crue FLIES OVER the CUKOO'S NEST. They are unbelievable. Most importantly, without the book, this movie wouldn't have existed. Thanks to Ken Kessey for his eloquence and passion in bringing this book possible. Wonder lies within you Ken Kessey."
1,Hated,"I actually did begin to read, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and I must say I was very uninterested, to say the least. I know that many people say, ""Don't judge a book by it's cover""... but maybe if the cover was more interesting, I could at least study the cover. The book itself did not draw me in. Personally, I don't care about Chief Bromden's ""psychotic"" episodes where he hallucinates into some fog. I was surprised because usually these kind of books interest me. I like to learn about how the human mind works, but McMurphy's constant perversion with the nurse annoyed me a bit. There was sexual tension between them that needed to be released, and wasn't. I didn't finish the book so my judgement calls might be wrong, but so far from what I read this book is nothing too interesting or too great. Sorry."
1,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"This book is a boring book. I started readng it and i found it really boring and diffcult to comprehend. The book was extremely boring. I only read a few pages in part one. But, i started reading the second part because i had to for class. The book got a little bit better, but not good enough to finish. I would read every nwo and then. I would not recommend this book to anyone who has hard time reading regualr books."
1,iedurtuilg5tg,"Honestly, I didn't take the time to even read this book. I got to the 3rd page and then decided it wasn't worth my time. I skipped around the book only to read a few pages for the quizzes i had to take in class. I found it to be extremely boring with multiple ideas leading off in all different directions. Keesey should most likely be condemned for writing such a pointless novel. I think we now know why LSD is illegal. I would not recommend this book to any living soul, and I strongly recommend that Kirkorsky re-evaluate his literature choices."
5,One of the best books I have managed to read in a while.,It a great book and I encourage others to read this book it's sad it funny beautiful and it will keep you reading
5,Great book...,"I got this book to read because it was required by a writing conference I was attending. I thought it was well written, in the fact that the description, dialogue, plot, etc. were excellent. I don't usually read ""these kind"" of books, my preference being fantasy, but I would recommend this book to anyone despite the depressing topic..."
3,BOB,Bob say's this was a good book.Bob liked this book. Bob say that the book is full of humor from the battles between the big nurse and Mcmurphy.to how stupid the people in there are. Bob say's go buy this book
4,"One flew east, one flew est, one flew over the cuckoos nest","This book is a great example of women's need to control man. It shows through the actions of Nurse Rathet how powerful and controling women want to be. Although a ""man"" is usually figured to be the dominant sex in life, women clearly show in this story that they are just as powerful as men. Randall Mcmurphy who is the protagonist in the story is the person who takes the role of the male in the story. However, Nurse Ratchet has no intentions of giving up her control over the combine to Mcmurphy. The stories climax is the ""dual"" betwenn Mcmurphy and Nurse Ratchet. This story clearly shows america's psychiatric society in the mid 1900's and how man and woman often clash for the right of dominance."
4,I thought that the book was hilarious!!,The book was great at but also got kind of slow at times. i loved the part when McMurphy broke the glass in the nurses station. I also loved when they all sat in front of the blank t.v.
4,"It's a cruel, cruel world out there.","I really liked the way that this book was written, although the whole ""plot"" of the story made me realize that our world is really corrupted. Our society is against anything different. I liked seeing the world through Big Chief's eyes and knowing what he thought of his own society in which he lives. For me, the whole book was about Big Chief's building himself up enough to make a breakthrough, and then finding the courage to break out of the combine and begin his life once again. I enjoyed the book and would encourage anyone who likes books out of the ordinary to read it."
3,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic anti-authority novel and a pretty good read. The story is told by Chief Bromden, a fragile giant who has delusions about the Combine, a conspiracy that runs the economy and keeps the population under control. In the mental hospital where he lives, the Combine is capably represented by Nurse Ratched, a rather tightly wound mother figure. Using a combination of psychological manipulation, drugs, and shock therapy, she and the rest of the staff keep the inmates in a passive state of acquiescence until her system is upset by the arrival of McMurphy, a red-headed drifter and non-conformist. The point of the book, of course, is to show how socialization processes have a homogenizing, leveling effect. Societies work best when people are interchangeable; exceptional people, or people who can't fit in, are usually not welcome."
1,Not the right editio,"I ordered this book expecting it to be the Great Penguins Edition, much to my surprise of it being an older edition. I ended having to buy a second book from another seller. Ended up spending more than i saved. So dissapointed."
2,Hollow Mind,"Ken Kesey was, is, and will always be a second string writer. He quite overwhelmingly lost any claim to authenticity or originality with the publication of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" It reads like the jottings and musings of an orderly with an eighth-grade education. Nurse Ratched's paper thin representation of the ""Man"" is so entirely hackneyed as to make the reader wish he or she were born absent the gift of sight and not have to read another single book.This is a non-redemptive novel, and deservingly so, given the author's/protagonist's trip through the hollow's of the mind where superficiality reigns supreme.Chris Roberts"
3,1 flew over cukus nest,I think the book was alright i mean i dont think i would of ever picked the book out my slef. But lisening to the class discusions and reading cliff notes. i think the people in the ward just have no life since they should all check them slefs out or break out to actually make it a good book. I Think that Mc Murphy was a pretty tho.
1,One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest,"This was the worst book I have ever received from ordering on-line. Amazon should no longer use this person! The book was late, dirty and used.I should have gone to the bookstore. Big mistake."
2,Eww!,"Initially, the book was very hard to understand. That was probably one of the main reasons why I was never interested in the book. McMurphy is by far one of the best characters in the book. He reminds me of myself at home. At home I try to take over the TV, gamble, and rebel against everything my parents say. When I say McMurphy rebels, he's all against nurse Ratchad. He does everything in his power not to do what he's supposed to do just like walking around in his underwear.If this book was alot more clear in the beginning it would be a very noble book and I think a lot more people could enjoy it."
2,"Vivid Prose, Juvenile Ideas","Two stars for the occasional vividness of Keysey's writing--and no more for the tiresome use to which it's been put. Stanley Kauffmann, mentioning this book in his review of the film version, referred to it was one of those books he ""needn't read--simply outlive."" And perhaps the time will come that this story of a psychopath looking for a cushy ride in a mental hospital and locking horns with the tough nurse in charge is seen as the whinings of a perpetual adolescent and not some epic struggle between freedom and conformity. All Randall MacMurphy wants to be free to do is steal and cheat and toy with women sexually. Subtract the hero-worshipping tone, and we have a denizen of a true-crime magazine story, the sort of lowlife the cops pick up after a string of violent rape-murders or robberies. In the end, you don't have to like Nurse Ratched to wonder if she might have done the world a favor . . ."
1,My Rant,"I did not enjoy reading this book. I had to force myself to finish it and at the same time avoid ripping out my hair due to boredom. The only character I liked was McMurphy. It was interesting to see the way he was able to impact each character in the book with his antics and ideas. Admittedly at some parts of the book I was uncomfortable reading about what went on in the asylum, and I think this was kind of the point, so the book was successful there. To me, the most important aspect of the book was, as Medgar Evers once said, ""You can kill a man but you can't kill an idea."" One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest demonstrates the power an idea can have over people, and how even if you cannot see the idea in action, once it has been introduced it will survive."
1,Extremely confusing,"I could not concentrate whenever I started to read this book. It is hard to differenciate between what is really happenening and Chief Bromden's hallucinations. The book has yet to capture my interest. There are too many different characters to keep track of. I have a really hard timing remembering which characters are chronics and which characters are acutes. Part 2 is supposed to be more captivating and easier to understand but if I can't make it past page 60, how am I going to get to part 2?"
3,A Cuckoo Book,"This is a very original novel that takes place in a mental hospital. McMurphy is clearly the big hero that cracks you up. He brings life to the ward and gives hope to the patients. The downside to this novel is it is VERY slow moving at the beginning though it does pick up as it goes. It's comical in parts but sometimes there doesn't seem to be much of a plot. Also,on this specific copy, with the house on the cover, the font is sooooo small! It's like 7 pt. or something. It makes the book seem slower. It is a very different and cuckoo read, and if you like action-packed books it's not for you. On the contrary, many people enjoy this book, you really get to know the characters."
3,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"This story is made up of skirmishes between McMurphy and Big Nurse. With a series of practical jokes he changes the life of his inmates. He make the patients feel smarter then the staff thought they were. However McMurphy would pay for his pranks with a lobotomy. I don't think that it was that good of a book, definatley not a modern masterpiece."
5,So much better than the movie...,"...and i thought the movie was great when I first saw it. I was amazed by the performances of Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher, so I told myself I have got to read the book.Luckily, my english litterature teacher in college gave us an assignement on that book. I have read it through and through, over and over. I have read it twice in about two days. I couldn't stop reading. The slang that Ken Kesey uses when Chief narrates the story is just great and really brings us back in that period.But what i really loved in the book, is that you get to know why chief is like that. In the movie, you only get a little bit of the story, and that's a shame. I really enjoyed the book and the movie. But if you only saw the movie, you're only getting half the picture, so I say, if you liked what you saw, then buy that book and read it, you won't be disappointed."
5,Masterpiece,"Kesey does not waste words. Each sentence has a deeper meaning. All the characters are unique. You will be blown away by the writing as well as the ideal behind this book.Sex, gambling, swearing... this book has it all.P.S.: There are hints of sexism, but they are minor details. This is truely an amazing book."
4,chief bullgoose loony,"if the reader approaches the book as a literal rendering of a story , the narration is bound to cause him problems.the chief is not consistent with the reality.kesey suggests that the choice of the indian narrator may have come from the association of the indians.it is obvious that the choice of the narrator corresponds with keseys interest with the states of the altered consciousness."
1,Price point,"My review is for the price point. I am currently at a major bookstore and the paperback book is the same price as what amazon is offering it on kindle. I have a membership to this bookstore so actually the book would be cheaper. Its really disappointing that I am not getting a discount or a cheaper book by being ""green"" and not buying a paper product of a book that is 50 years old. It is actually quite obnoxious."
5,"Call me crazy, but. . .","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a book about an insane asylum in the mid part of this century. It is told in a distinctive style that lets you identify with the insane people (along with a few that are not quite so crazy). You can genuinely feel the power in certain events, like when Chief Bromden looks out the window for the first time. The reader is always on the edge of his seat, waiting for something else to happen. Everyone I recommend the book to gets something a little different out of it, which is why this is such a tough review to write. You really have to read the book, because there is no real way I can explain it to you. I would strongly recommend the book to anyone who loves a good story."
3,"An Interesting Tale, Not An Engrossing One.","The first half of this book is quite slow. It does have its funny and sincere moments though. If the first half of the book was as well written as the last half, it would deem five stars. The protagonist in this tale is a good natured lug who tries to inject the spirit of life into a ward of patients of mental illness. He unveils the hollowness and darkness they live day in, and day out, while striving to weaken the clinical hold over them by the head nurse. It is a touching and heartwarming story. It illuminates the contemptible views we had, and to a large extent still have of ""mental illness."""
4,One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,"I enjoyed reading One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey because throughout the novel Randle Patrick McMurphy helps the other men realize they're not as crazy as they thought. He tries to make shortcuts through Nurse Ratched's rules. Also, he tries to get the best of her to prove she isn't as strong and powerful as the men think she is. The other men on the ward start to look up to McMurphy and begin to believe he is their savior."
3,Overview of Cuckoo's,"I believe that Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest gives a different perspective of what the every day person thinks of a psyciatric ward. I myself did not find this book a real interest grabber. It draged alot in the begining and alot of the humor really wasn't that funny.One creative aspect to this story was the hallucinations that the narrorator Cheif Brodem has. Kesey uses the fog as a get away. But also as a life turner.Many of the characters in the story also did not a appiel to me. Normally there is one person you can some what relate to, but not in this case.Big Nurse to me was over exagerated and non realistic.I guess I give Kesey credit for his thoughts on paper and his imagination but I don't believe that him himself sober and not on LSD would make any type of writer."
5,Crazy House,What I do not like about this book is the fact that they are living in a dictatorship enviroment. These chronics and acutes are put through a lot. They have no choice of what they want to do. They have to follow Nurse Ratchets every order. I feel that the only thing I like about this book is the fact that McMurphy stands up for himself and that he teachers the other people in this nut house how to stand up for themselves as well. The book has a good story line I am just not into reading about crazy peoples problems. I have enough problems of my own.
3,One Flew Under the Cuckoo's Nest,"Unfortunetly I have not gotten far enough to write a decent review. But from what I heard and what I have read so far, it is pretty decent. Chief Broom goes through many experiences throught the text. His personality and his character eventually grows from a very shy, ""deaf"" man, up to a man that can make his own desicions. The characters go through the institution with an attitude that they will soon get out. They know that they ultimatly know that the Nurse decides when they will leave. They dont tell this to the main character, who is trying ever-so-hard to get by with his 2 month sentence. Through conflicts, the loss of friends, and proving himself, he goes around defying the rules and arrouses the other patients to step up for what they believe and get them to stand up for themselves. I would recommend this book to people who want to read about a person going through his life in an instituion and wants to be free."
3,Cuckoo's Nest,"Overall, this is a decent book where all the inmates are affected by a new person by the name of McMurphy. Everyone changes once he enters the ward. Everyone starts to think for themselves and stand up for what they believe. This turns out good for some people, and bad for others. One of the main characters, Chief Bromden, is a large Native American who is thought to be dumb and deaf. Over the course of McMurphy's stay, he comes out of his shell and actually speaks. There are other people who come out in different ways. For example, Billy Bibbit is a shy man who stutters, and McMurphy changes him. He finally gets a woman and then Nurse Ratched, the ""bad person"" of the story, finds this out and threatens to tell his mom. He ends up committing suicide. Ratched represents repressed life while McMurphy is very outgoing. I recommend this book to any person in high school or above. This book is complicated to read in the beginning, but over time it gets easier. This is a decent book to read."
3,banned book assignment,"Was shipped quickly, though the condition of the book was not the greatest. It was ment to be stored and not read, as the pages when i read them started tearing when i turned them. I had gotten this book as an assignment for a banned book assignment. I had watched the movie (a classic), and enjoyed reading the book much better."
4,"a common theme, a different approach","the topic explored in one flew over the cuckoo's nest is not innovative by any means, it is touched on in other novels like a clock work orange and 1984, perhaps more clearly. the detail that sets it apart from these other novels, though, is the setting. placed at a mental hospital, it allows the book to dabble in the socially taboo subject of dementia, daring to explore the effects of government intervention and ostracism. this is not a book that makes you feel particularly happy or enlightened, but an excellent read nonetheless."
4,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"this was a brilliant book. once again, ken kesey establishes wit, courage, and remarkable tactics in his words. well done."
1,"This is not the real ""Green Hell""!!!!!","This is not the real ""Green Hell""!!!!!It's not a great book either. I recommend to read ""Green Hell"", a classic 1935 novel by costarrican author José Marín Cañas, about the War of El Chaco.There are lots of ""new"" novels with the same name, this is one of 'em, copyright holders, where are you?????"
3,I wish this were longer,"What a great 300 page story packed into 100 pages. This is one of those stories that everyone should read, but sadly the delivery of the walk home is so straightforward. I wanted to know more about what the three girls went through, I wanted to really be able to see into them a little more. That said, western readers love characters. They do. It's a trait of being brought up on those books we all read in high school. This book does subvert expectations about character being central rather than journey or community. Indeed, journey and community are paramount to this story. But I still would have loved 200 more pages. So many places left me wanting for more landscape, more discussion of language, more description of the people. Just more. Read it, but know that there's a whole other story underneath this one as well."
4,Rabbit-Proof Fence,"'Rabbit-Proof Fence' is the short, but completely captivating story of three girls escape from a half-caste aboriginal centre and their epic, long walk home back to their families. This book is simply written, but extremely evocative and can easily be read in a couple of hours. But, for those hours, you will live and breathe the lives of these tenacious and brave girls completely. Written by the daughter of one of the girls (Molly) and pieced together from recollections and telegram records, this book charts what the human spirit is capable of and what bravery was shown by the girls to get back to their homes. A simple story, beautifully told and one to leave you awe inspired and full of respect. A solid four stars.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,needs more,The story is amazing. The writing however is ok. There are many things that need an explanation that aren't given one. If the book were two or three times as long it would be perfect.
3,I saw the movie first,Reading the book after seeing the movie was a little disappointing. I was glued to the movie but the book didn't quite hold my attention.
4,Australia's Lost Generation,"The speed of service from Amazon is second to none. I have free two-day Prime shipping & received this book in ONE day.I am giving the book 4 stars, but would give the story 10 if I could. The writing is okay - but its really the story itself that deserves to be read. The Lost Generation of Australia has been swept under the rug for decades & in literature is grossly misrepresented. This stealing of children from their families lasted into the 70's when my mother was living & working there.We (I am a dual citizen of Australia & the USA) stole their children, their lands, their women, their culture & their language, yet this book at face value is one of adventure & the enduring human spirit. The feeling of injustice this book may awaken is not a result of browbeating, or lectures contained within the text, but a manifestation of our own humanity & guilt.I would encourage anyone wanting to understand Australian or Aboriginal culture more deeply to read this book"
5,Wonderful Multi-Audience CD,"I purchased this CD specifically for the ""2001-A Space Odyssey"" soundtract to play at my son's 7th Birthday Party with a ""Star Wars"" Theme....we played it while the children were entering and placing their special object into a time capsule that we will open in 2019 at the children's High School Graduation Party....the other tracks are classical and wonderful to listen to...my son likes to fall asleep to it, my husband likes to unwind to it.....Highly recommend"
1,DON'T BUY THIS CD,"Of course all students of Talmud need a Jastrow dictionary, but this CD rom is a scam! It has no search capacity--you have to scroll through 1700+ pages to find what you're looking for. Some con artist must have scanned the book into PDF format and then put it out on the market for nearly 20 dollars a pop. Shameful, shameful, shameful! It is completely unusable."
3,Needs to be updated and cleaned up,"Although no Hebrew or Aramaic scholar should be without this dictionary, the current edition of this text needs to be updated. The words at the top of each page are difficult to read and the title page indicates that this text only includes entries for the letters aleph through kaph when, in fact, the dictionary includes entries from aleph to tav. The publisher needs to clean up these problems rather than just printing new texts from the same plates that they have been using for the last eighteen years."
2,CD version unhelpful,"I agree with the posters here about the usefulness of the content of the Jastrow. The CD-Rom version, however, has been very disappointing. It's just a massive PDF with the entire dictionary scanned in. I guess that helps if you need to zoom in on the type to see what's going on, but the fact that they didn't even bother to put in a search option really bugs me. Really, aside from the zooming (and physical space issues, I guess), there's no reason to buy this on CD-Rom."
3,Good and Comprehensive,"The Jastrow is a good reference piece. It describes the language of Aramaic very well, albeit dated (c. 1900s). There are much more recent additions, (cf. Hebrew University's Initiative). However, it is comparatively cheaper than its Hebrew University Counterpart. The Jastrow is a comprehensive treatment of Jewish-Aramaic. It does however, list according to Root, which makes finding forms difficult (especially for the beginner). It does however list a few examples, and references. Jastrow however is one of scholars of the reform movement (see the introduction). This makes the work not entirely reliable from an Orthodox perspective. It is however scholarly. The typeface is difficult to read, and the whole book needs serious updating and review."
5,It is a very useful cd-rom,"It is a very useful cd-rom,with the complete Jastrow dictionary in it.Jastrow brings down numerous examples of the usage of eachword, ensuring a firm grasp of each word's nuances.And with the CD version you can print what you need...Great Book and very good cd-rom"
4,Jastrow,"Jastrow made a great workthis dictionary can help you to learn any aramaic textbut in my case help me a lot to learn the talmud.It is difficult to thread one's way through its massive pages unless assisted by the helpful experts who contrive systematic directives -'who make handles to the Torah'- to meet the varied approaches of those who seek to know its wisdom and doctrine, its laws and its poetry, its folklore and even its apparent trivia. The well-known Midrash comes to mind.King Solomon applied his wisdom and prudence to help students find their way through the intricacies of the Torah.He was like the clever man in the parable of the large palace with many doors where a man would enter, become confused and not find the door by which he entered.The clever man took a clew of rope and suspended it by the door of entry so that it could serve as a guide to all who entered or came out."
4,good,not quite as heavy as I had thought but this was a good buy for the price. I would order it again.
4,a nice Mid-level Graphic Card,"I've spent quite some time researching and comparing all major graphic cards before I decided to take this one. Several reasons:First, this is a card without a fan. This means the card will make NO noise. Also this means this card probably doesn't generate much heat.Second, Nvidia cards on average are faster than ATIs nowadays. 7600gs>x1600pro, 7300gt>x1300.Third, this card has got all the stuff that its higher level card 7600gt has. The only difference is the speed of memory and core. So we can expect it to have a nearer performance to 7600gt if we can OC it. And since this 7600gs' starting point is only at 400MHZ/800MHZ, I think I will have some chances. Also this is a 90nm card.I have had a great experience with it. I can play all current picky games. The only weakness that I can see is that you cannot expect to use it to play the current popular 3D games with all the effects turned on or at a resolution higher than 1024*768."
1,Great idea if it worked,"It took forever to ""enroll"" a fingerprint. Despite trying multiple fingers was unable to get any consistent recognition--takes far longer to get a good swipe then to type a password. Am sending it back."
3,"OK keyboard, terrible fingerprint scanner","I got this on sale (mercifully) hoping to take advantage of the biometric fingerprint scanner to save time and possibly to skip all those passwords. Important note: the functionality with Windows 7 is not good. The drivers that came with the product were incompatible with Windows 7 and I had to hunt the internet advice boards for hours to make it work at all. When I did get it functioning, the training and operation also took forever. At best, it reads a fingerprint swipe 1 out of 5 times. At worst, I have to enter my password to bypass it. A good concept, but badly executed. Also, after 2 months of ownership, the print is already fading on some of the keyboard keys. Skip this mess and buy a generic keyboard for less.Note: I never did get the fingerprint manager software working to allow a swipe in place of multiple passswords."
1,Disappointing,"This book was way over my head. I am a avid reader and do enjoy the O'Shaughnessy's books, but this one left me behind."
4,These sisters never,"disappoint...a very good page turner. As a very math-averse person whose eyes glazed over when it got to the bit about integers and prime numbers,,,well, I just skimmed over those parts to get back to the story. An unusual premise...are there really people who can count cards, etc. in a blackjack game?? Interesting and surprising. Nina doesn't seem as strong as she did in some of the earlier books. And Bob is really growing up. Not one of their best, but well worth a read."
3,I wanted it to be five stars,"I have been a fan of these authors since the beginning. Some books are better than others, and at the start I thought this book was going to be one of the very best. The authors' prose style has improved, Nina has a full and realistic life (not always the case in the past, where plot seemed to push character), the story is intriguing, and the other viewpoint character - one of the witnesses to the crime - is fascinating. I was engrossed in the story all along, but by the end I was scratching my head, feeling cheated. The motivations and actions of the main culprits (trying not to give too much away here) are totally without foundation or logic. That ruined the story for me. I recommended the book to a couple of friends while I was reading it, and I've had to go back and tell them, ""maybe not."" Still, if you don't think about logic or motivation but just go along for the ride, it's a fine ride."
2,Shaky plot and premise,"I am a big fan of the Nina Reilly series; however, this one was not up to par. Overkill(pun intended) on both the math theory and the number of witnesses killed with our heroine standing right next to them. Dialogue and character development also not as stellar as we've grown to expect with this author(s)----some of it unfortunately sounded like a romance novel (albeit one of the better ones). Hopefully, next one will be up to the standard---haven't given up, but was disappointed!"
3,Disappointing,"The 11th entry into the Nina Riley series is the first real disappointment the author has come up with.For an author who has specialized in tight plotting, CASE OF LIES comes as a major surprise. It suffers from ""Just Cause"" syndrome -- killers kill just because they want to, player gamble just because they want to, a minor red herring character with-holds major evidence until page 300 for no good reason than to try and tie all the flapping loose plots threads together that are thrashing around. Nina doesn't even really solve the case; she's as fooled as everybody else is.Adequate quick mystery reading, but compare it with say, UNFIT TO PRACTICE from a few years back, and it is definately wanting. Hopefully the series will bounce back, although the outlook is grim, with the authors' next novel being their first non-series, stand-alone."
1,Incredibly boring mystery,"I am a big mystery fan - mostly of the English variety. American mysteries are too action oriented , English mysteries are more interior. This book to my mind did not hang together, was improbable and really quite uninteresting except for increasing my understanding of prime numbers. I actually wound up skimming the last 4/5ths of it. I kept asking myself why I was bothering at all."
1,Disappointing Plot & Reader,"I was terribly disappointed with this Audio book because of the plot and the reader. Laurel Merlington was a bad choice to read the book she can only do young American women accents. She butchered most of the male voices, the other older woman lawyer and all the foreign accents. It's clear she has never heard a German speak. The German girl's accent was annoyingly wrong.As for the plot, from the pointless foray into mathematics to the unlikely happenings; e.g. where did this unsophisticated, rather stupid shooter get money from to go to Germany and find the witnesses? Why wasn't Nina Reilly shot at the masseuse's parlor? Why would the shooter hang around a Lake Tahoe?Much of the book does not make sense. I am sorry I bought it."
2,"By far, not one of the best in the series","The longer this series runs, the less interesting it becomes. Nina seems to be increasingly reactive rather than pro-active. I guess I never quite understood why she pushed Paul out of her life and that action doesn't seem to have improved either her outlook on life or her ability to choose cases/clients in her own best interest. I finished this only out of respect to the time I've spent reading the series."
4,M or F by Lisa Papademetriou and Chris Tebbetts,"M or F by Lisa Papademetriou and Chris Tebbetts was a joyful book all about boys, crushes and high school drama. The book tells the story of Frannie and her best friend Marcus and their life in high school. M or F is a Cyrano De Bergerac for the modern age. Just like in the play Cyrano De Bergerac, the main character likes someone who they are afraid to talk to, and they get someone else to do the talking for them. In M or F, Frannie likes Jeffrey, Marcus tells her to talk with him on-line, but she is afraid he won't like her because of the things she might say. Frannie gets her friend Marcus to have all of the conversations. Jeffrey and Marcus really hit it off, and Marcus begins to believe that Jeffrey is really falling for him. M or F is a great book to read with a lot of funny action and moments."
3,Missing parts,"I was disappointed that the accomplishments and contributions of French, Spanish, Swedish, German, etc., ethnic groups to the Mississippi story was not told. I think the book gave excellent coverage of the contributions of the black ethnic groups that I was unaware. Is this a 'politically correct' version of the Mississippi story?"
4,The good and the bad,"I have been using this device for 8 months and been pretty happy with it. As with all phones and PDA's it has it quirks. The biggest one being that it occasionally locks up and there is no rhyme or reason to why and sometimes takes 20 minutes to get the thing reset and back up and working. It is not something that happens all the time but it does happen.On the pluses, syncing with my corporate mail, calanders and contacts without any effort on my part. I love this seemless integration.On the negetive,it is hard to dail numbers while doing something else, like driving.Jury's still out on the perdictive typing. And with large fingers, sometimes I may cause my own issues.Overall, I like the device and am going purchase one for my wife who has email envy..."
5,Great phone and handheld,I love this phone. Once you get used to the keyboard it is great. I used to have a sidekick and was limited to what T mobile would allow me to download. Now I can go online and download all sorts of games and programs I want. I love it. I am able to have emails from sevral email accounts I have online delivered to the phone. I would recommend this over the sidekick any day.
2,Great for email - bad for phone calls,"I have had my phone for almost one year. The screen is great, emails come through fast and I have no problem typing a quick email or text message with the keys. However, the microphone is super sensitive and picks up every bit of background noise. Plus, you have to keep the phone well away from your mouth or people will not be able to hear you. Many times people tell me it sounds like you are in a tunnel. In the car, the sound is worse. I am going to look at that new blackberry 8700 that Cingular now offers as a replacement. And i did download the latest software that was supposed to fix this microphone problem, it didn't."
4,Had it for while,"This device does an outstanding job with email. The PDA functionality is equally good and syncs nicely with outlook. Personally, I have not had a problem with battery life, although the phone quality is not perfect. Using the Suretype keypad is almost as fast as typing on a regular QWERTY keyboard. I give this device an overall 4 because the browser is a disaster (but that's hardly RIM's fault). It's way too slow and altogether very annoying. Buy this device for its email functionality and not the browser. My overall experience: cannot survive without it."
3,Cannot view image attachments,Cannot view image attachments. They use tricky marketing by saying it support attachments. Even their user guides say it. But what they don't say is that T-Mobile has disabled the viewing of image attachments. Shame on T-Mobile!
1,Rotten Berry,"Don't buy this phone.The ugly:Endless resets. More than once I had to pull the battery out to get it to work. It will keep searching for a signal until you do so.It also gets into a ""call failed"" mode that will go on and on until you...big surprise....pull the battery and watch the dancing hour glass.Many is the time due to the above that I did not know I could not get calls and almost mucked up my day.Ringer very low and the setting are overly complex. Crappy ring tones.The organizer---you'd do better with a PDA.The good...When I am done with my contract I will get a nail and drive it through the electronic heart of this piece of junk."
2,"Not so great PDA, not so great Phone","I've had this phone for about 6 months and will definitely be trading in for a full keyboard PDA/Phone. If you do any volume of email at all, this thing will drive you crazy! The built in dictionary must be using some type of foreign language, because it comes up with words that don't exist and aren't even close to what you are typing. The calendar function is just ok, web is a joke, address book is just ok. As a phone it's too bulky. My recommendation if you are into BlackBerry, get a full size keyboard and a bluetooth headset. Luckily, it was practically free when I got it. After owning this Blackberry, I'll definitely research something outside RIM for my next PDA/Phone."
2,"This is a cool phone, but def. test one before buying","Yea, there was SUCH a HYPE when this phone came out, so i decided to purchase it. Yeah, it looks sleek and all, but I didn't find it to be too useful - because the interface is not very user-friendly. Plus, there were many bugs in it. many problems with AIM and e-mail and that.The contacts totally SCREWED up the address on my computer, so I decided to part ways with this phone, and I got the TREO 650 pda phone - that is the BEST thing out there - check it out!"
4,Great color screen,"Just received this unit.Thus far, very happy with the phone and the ability to surf the web.The only down side that I have discovered is the keyboard does not have the 'ABC' on the keypad the way a desk phone is equipped.Thus, it is hard to 'spell' out a persons name when using a voice mail system."
2,Good until it stops working,"I liked this phone pretty well until the 'shift' key stopped working. It started acting up a week before warranty ran out--unfortunately, I didn't click to that, and I waited to see if it would work itself out. It just got worse.I had run down T-Mobile in this review previously, as they were not much help in this situation, but I am not sure that's fair. If the phone's out of warranty, it's out of warranty, you know? I was just frustrated. I've been content w/T-Mobile overall, though this instance wasn't resolved satisfactorily.Pretty good software, OK phone service, subpar keypad design. I see they've changed the keys on the 7105--maybe they changed some things for the better. I do not recommend the 7100, however."
1,poor phone/ marginal PDA,"phone reception is very marginal. Lots of dropped calls. Lots of complaints from people calling me. The phone is definitely weaker than standard T-mobile phones. I can be standing next to someone with a T-mobile phone and they have 4 bars and can place calls. At the same time and place, my 7100t gets one bar and cannot call or receive calls. This is the 4th 7100t that they have sent me and all have the same or worse problems. I have this problem in an area that T-mobile says is a great reception area, and have similar problems in the middle of big airports and cities.PDA limited but works. Only complaint is that several times each week the PDA does a hard reset in the middle of a call, which takes about 6 minutes to complete before I can use the phone again."

5,book review,"Listen, I was enjoying the book when I came accross missing chapters. Two, I believe. What can you do about this? I would like another book if possible.--Arturo"
3,"not too good, not too bad","It only took me a couple days to finish this book. It is very brief, and easy to read. Sproul gives a very brief summary of the major philosophers. If you are looking for an intense introduction into what the major philosophers throughout history have taught, this is not the place to go. However, if you are looking for a brief and very simple overview of some of the major philosophers (he left out some major ones too) and their views explained and a simple and easy to understand way, then this would be a nice book for you to check out."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","After watching this 80s slasher flick, my review for this would probably say that it wasnt bad, but wasn't great. Now we all know that 80s slasher flicks can be predictable, but this film is VERY predictable. Any 80s Horror Collector will certainly add this to their collection, for those of you who are looking for an actual scare, well you might find this film to be boring. I collect horror films, so I am happy to add it to my collection.I will say that the video quality was excellent, considering the age of this film."
3,mortuary is for the dead!,if you like 80's horror and classic horror like me you'll like this one. i had never seen it. it's not as great as some onhere have reviewed but it's good. bill paxson is really good as the psycho kid. a little boring in middle but ending is good.it has just enough gore and horror for me unlike new movies with all the blood and gore and no story.
2,"""I'm going to embalm you.""","Not what I had hoped for, this film barely classifies as a slasher film; you can count the number of victims on one hand, with a digit leftover! The plot plods along in no hurry to get anywhere. There's little in the way of suspense, no fright. The pacing is way off; most scenes feel as if they're skipping a beat, trying to be something they're not. There's no great secret who is doing what and why. The villain is standard fare, employing the usual affectations: wild eyes and a crazy grin. Even the ending is lazy. For me, this was a huge disappointment."
1,overpriced pamphlet,"Other reviews give the impression this is a comprehensive text. It is not. It's as informative as a vague pamphlet, worth 50 cents at most. I found a real book on electrology: Principles and Practice of Electrical Epilation by Godfrey. (Unlike who I'm guessing the other reviewers are, I don't know the author of the book I'm recommending.)"
3,Not a Solid Winner,"I was really glad to find a new series by Anne Parry, though her writing is always very readable, this book was not as satisfying for me.I fell that the characters are well developed, however the World War I setting is too depressing.I just can't enjoy that setting. The story could well have been told, tightly in one volume instead of the projected five. I have read the first three, I don't think I care enough about the main storyline to buy the last two."
3,Something to think about...,"I just found this out yesterday and it might add a new dimension to your reading while enjoying Anne Perry novels. When Anne Perry was a young girl, she and one of her friends were convicted of murder and put in jail. This story is told in the movie ""Heavenly Creatures"" directed by Peter Jackson of Lord of the Rings Fame.It'll be fun to read her novels now and see how her past growing up years shapes what she writes."
1,Quality of plot and writing continue their downward trend,"I found this book, and the other 2 in the series, to be poorly written. I have enjoyed her both her Pitt and Monk novels, but this series seems almost to be by a different author. I find the style in which she 'hides' the identity of the Peacekeeper and his associates to be particularly annoying. The action seems to consist of people driving back and forth, and thinking, and changing their minds, and thinking more. There does not seem to be much investigating- just suspecting someone for a while, then suspecing someone else."
3,Angels in the Gloom,"It was not as good as the previous books in the series, still I enjoyed the continuing saga of this WWI era British family. Mainly, I love the whole atmosphere of the War years in Europe...... sort of nostalgic I suppose. Anne Perry is excellent when it comes to take you back in time."
5,Beyond Mystery To Magnificent World Literature,"It does not matter to me - the title, subject, or look-of-a-book by one of the greatest authors of our time, Ms. Anne Perry. What matters is that I know as a retired criminal attorney and author myself, that I am going to get the absolute best that great literature has to offer. And this latest masterpiece, Angels In The Gloom, is no exception. Ms. Perry has utterly transcended the genre of mystery by bringing to the fore, world-wide issues concerning all of humanity that once again span the good versus evil dymanic amid forces of pyschology, metaphysics, religion, faith-or-no-faith, history, economics, morality, philosophy, law - and, of cousrse, poetry. Because her prose is truly that grand. Bravo Anne! You've done it again!"
5,Wonderful!,This book contains nothing but full page reproductions of Bill Mauldin's cartoons drawn during WWII. This is a fantastic addition to any WWII buff's collection. Snap this one up quickly!
4,Great for the holiday dinners!,"I only use this on the holidays to keep the gravy warm at dinner. My only complaint is that the cord is much much too short. Unit works good, have had it for two years now."
2,Warmer for the table,I am not thrilled about it. Because it takes long time to warm it up. I am kind of suck with that.
4,Applause from Heaven,"Very beautifully written by one of my favorites, Max Lucado. Using this text for Bible Study with friends. I like it."
3,Didn't much like the questions,"The chapters were very interesting and had lots of good lessons; however, our group did not like the group discussion questions at the end. Had some misprints in chapters and and references to the Bible which confused us. Need to do a better job in editing."
4,excellent books,"these books are full of information on Scot-Irish settlements in early Virginia, a special time in the history of America. It is certainly worth the price to all who pursue genealogy in this time period."
5,Great resource Available Free,"These are invaluable resources for the researcher, but they're available free online from google books. No need to buy them."
1,Ultra Militarism At Its Worst,A detailed blueprint for brutal imperialism. This text sets the stage for perpetual warfare and the constant manufacturing of security threats to achieve that end.
1,Doctrine of Evil,Dig below the surface and this book is Hitlerian doctrine gussied up with Democractic Mythology. A recipe for world disaster. Read only if you worship at the feet of Machiavelli.
1,"If you want a CONSERVATIVE perspective, this is not the book for you","I was reading the review written below that indicated that this book gives the conservative perspective on the war in Iraq. You couldn't be more wrong.This book gives you the NEO-CONSERVATIVE perspetive for going to war. And as with anything the neo cons try to sell you (see the Weekly Standard, Commentary magazine or anything written by Richard Perle or Robert Kagan), this is more propaganda than it is fact. This book was clearly written to promote a war that this small, but influential political faction have been pushing for since the early 90s.If you want a CONSERVATIVE perspective on all this, pick up Pat Buchanan's ""Where the Right Went Wrong"" or the recently released book from Scott Ritter. The ""Neo-Conned"" series is also a good starting point."
5,The way monsters are born,"I would venture to guess that some others who reviewed this book did not read it, but assumed because of its authors it was propaganda. I found it a historical account of how we came to the clear and present danger of WMD in the hands of dictators and madmen who consider the American people their enemy.While it did not explain why they hate Americans it does chronicle years and years of foreign policies that failed in their obligations to protect America.While I did not find it a easy read I would say everyone should read it to understand how we got to this point in time and why we should not and will not take no for an answer this time around!"
4,"Finally, a book that asks the missing Next Questions","Either the ""reader from New York City"" below read a quite different book, or s/he is one of those unfortunates who has only one template (racism) for all social and political phenomena. This book takes a realistic look at the options available to advance our national interests (including the interests of all the ""brown people"" immigrants the reader below cites). It also considers the results of various choices the U.S. has made in the past, or can make now, and describes how those results lead to a need to make MORE choices. Some readers may disagree with its conclusions - that it is in the U.S. interest to intervene in Iraq actively and violently - but the book arrives at those conclusions after honest analysis."
3,Why does anyone listen to this guy,"Everytime he makes a predictions or shares his ""expertise,"" only a few months later he is shown irrefutably to have been wrong. Why does he still get on any talk show as a specialist or knowledgeable about ANYTHING?He said our invasion of Iraq would quickly lead to good things, and the more we get involved, the more we follow KRISTOL'S advice, the more the place spirals into chaos."
3,"Starts fast, gets boring pretty quickly, disappointing","Following a boring intro, the first four chapters read almost like a good novel, but then it becomes rather pedantic. It doesn't appear to have been proof read, as mistakes such as having Saddam Hussein invading Iraq (probably meant Iran)and calling French President, Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister don't add to the scholarliness of this effort. The reference notes are only indexed by page and the reader has to search for or conclude, to what they refer."
2,disappointed,"I purchased and read Bambi's first book on wedding photography published in 2000 and also this one expecting new information and an updated on all that has changed over the past 5+ years. I was disappointed to find little new information other than a lot of plugs for Canon equipment.Many images that illustrate the value of NIK filters for Photoshop but little discussion of when to use them or why. One example is provided on an approach to converting images to black and white but no mention of the literally dozens of ways to do this and the many after-market action sets by Kubota and others to make this easy and efficient.Strongly suggest anyone getting into wedding photography or making the transition to digital from film purchase first the excellent book ""Digital Wedding Photography"" by Glen Johnson. Then fill in the gaps with books such as Bambi's - though I believe her 2000 book was better than this latest one which is largely a cosmetic makeover."
3,Icing without any cake,"This book is definately pretty to look at and it offers a few tips that any amateur photographer could make good use of, but the title is certainly misleading and overall its not a good buy if you're hoping to learn something. I found it to be very light on practical wedding photography information and heavy on photos.... It might answer your basic ""what"" questions, but it doesn't come close to answering any ""why"" or ""how"" questions. If you're looking for a book with several beautiful pictures that would look great on your coffee table, than this book is for you, but if you're actually hoping to learn something, I'd recommend buying something else."
1,First book much better,"I returned this book after the first read. As a new wedding photographer I admire Cantrell's style and her first book was excellent, thus I had high expections for her second book which covered digital wedding photography. It seems as if she was distracted in writing this book. The explanations regarding equipment, dealing with the wedding couple, pricing, are vague and the explanations tired and repetetive, and many of the photos are out of focus and grainy. Definitely not of the quality and caliber of her first writing endeavor. If one is buying this book searching for ideas on how to effectively manage your digital workflow, deal with jpeg vs. raw, eye-candy photos for inspiration for one's one work, and digital techniques for wedding photography, you will not find it here. You may want to purchase her first book for inspiration and ideas, it is better written."
2,Not worth $18,"This book has some cute pictures in it, but most of the info is misleading like how to find dust on your lens/sensor on your digital, they say to shoot wide open at a light source but everyone knows you stop your lens down to f/16+ to see dusty sensors or lenses. Alot of the pictures look amature at best, and the use of Nik filters on alot of them just does not look right.The print is a so so job, alot of the pictures look like blobs, but then again that might be from the original photo.I can only recommend this book if you find it on sale for under $9."
4,Good general book on Digital Wedding photography,"Bambi covers all the basics, from before the event, the event, manipulating the image and delivery. Not a lot of details (except she does give exactly what is in her camera bag), but overall a good book. I was somewhat surprised at the poor quality of some of the images, especially the cover image. Not what one would expect from Bambi."
3,are you a photographer?,"If you are a photographer, you know perfectly well that no book is going to teach you much of the style you develop on your own. It is great for general ideas, but you really should be able to see who you are working with and figure out what kind of shots will suit the couple. I doubt that there are many brides that will appreciate a picture like the one on the front cover of this book."
1,One of the best books on COM programming available.,"One of the things I like best about this bookis its comparison to other object models, butespecially to RPC. The examples and experimentsare well written and provide much insight. Thechapters about DCOM under the hood is simplygreat!!! Buy it if you want to truly know DCOM."
5,DCOM jumpstart and comprehensive coverage of details,"Learning about DCOM is not easy. Yet, the book makes it very likely that almost any reader with some VC++ background can do it. The entire book, starting from first few ""backgrounder"" chapters and ending with chapters about NT Services, Multithreading, Microsoft Transaction Server, as well as Appendix, is very useful from both theoretical and practical points of view. Dr. Richard Grimes made sure that his detailed explanation of issues is complemented by good code examples. Besides DCOM-specific things, the author explains (not fully covers, though!) many general topics like COM itself, ATL, and COM Threading Models, which might be helpful for readers without solid background in those areas. If you are going to work on design and/or implementation of DCOM-based systems I cannot suggest any better book to read - Professional DCOM Programming really stands out!"

The examples and experimentsare well written and provide much insight. Thechapters about DCOM under the hood is simplygreat!!! Buy it if you want to truly know DCOM."
4,Nice book for experienced developers,"This is a good book for experienced developers but for beginners it is not, as the flow is difficult to understand. But examples are very practical."
5,Dr. Grimes does it again!,"Whenever an author cuts to the chase in 2 chapters, he's done busy developers a favor! I am usually swamped at work, and need a book that can get me started quickly. I have (once again) used one of Dr. Grimes' books to get my compiler going in order to solve a remotable distributed systems problem. He DOES cover all the bases. WARNING: You had better read Dale Rogerson's book (Inside COM) first. You will need the detailed background in COM to get the most out of a more advanced treatise lik this."
3,"Very handy, but ""crisp breeze"" scent is better","These are very handy--you can stick one right on the side of your toilets with the two-sided tape. The scent comes out strongly almost immediately, so you can screw it shut again by the time you leave the bathroom. I'd recommend the ""crisp breeze"" scent over the ""fresh waters,"" however. This one smells like the disinfectant used in a lot of restaurant bathrooms, where they leave them open all the time until the scent is suffocating."
3,Doesn't last very long.,"It worked amazingly well when i got them, and freshened up the room a lot. however, after just 5 days, the smell died out. They are good for short periods, but not as a permanent solution."
1,Didnt seem to make much difference,"I put one of these up in our kitchen, and another near the cat litter tray in our spare room. It hasn't made a difference in either places. I will not be buying this product again."
3,Not as strong as anticipated.,"We ordered this to uses in our garbage container container. I find the air freshening power of these to be a little less then what I am used to from this product,. I had to use both in the same area for the same effect."
1,Disappointed,"This item was not at all what is seems to be. The box was the only durable part of the toy. I unfortuantely purchased 3 of these as Christmas gifts for 3 different boys ages 5 & 6 years old. After seeing them open and what was in the box, I was very disappointed."
4,fun for the whole family,My niece enjoyed this magic set. She was able to figure out a few of the tricks without anyones help. She is 5 years old. Her little sister even enjoyed figuring out new tricks to use the pieces for.
4,Son loves it!,"While some of the stuff in this kit is a little chintzy, my son absolutely loved learning the tricks and showing them to everyone. It is one of the few things he still plays with months after the purchase. I would recommend this product to someone else if they asked."
5,So original,"Having been a big fan of Agatha Christie all my life, I found Anne Perry to be comparable and just as original. Especially in this book. From the first word to the last, she had me hooked and I read this book in record time.Sadly, against the advice of others, I read this book first instead of starting the series with ""Cater Street Hangman."" I was just so eager because I heard this was the best of the series. While that might be true, I also found that because I read this book first, I kind of ruined it for myself with the previous books becuase I knew how things would turn out. So my advice is read this, but start with ""Cater Street Hangman"" if you are new to the Pitt series. (And believe me, after reading this one, you'll WANT to read the others.)"
4,You'll Love the Mysterious Woman in Cerise!,"Ninth in the Thomas Pitt series by Anne Perry, Charlotte, Thomas Pitt's wife, and her sister, Emily, play major roles in helping Pitt with his investigation of an unsolved murder in the upperclass neighborhood of Hanover Close. In this book, Silence in Hanover Close, the author, I believe for the first time, toys with treason and its cover up as a possible motive for murder. It turns out not to be the case but, as with all Anne Perry's Pitt mysteries, the motive and the murderer are revealed in the final pages.I loved the intricate plotting, the main characters, the minor characters, the portrayal of the mysterious figure, the woman in cerise. Perry evokes the Victorian age with a deft hand, and paints a picture in this book of the rigors of a life in service as well as the state of prisons in Victorian England."
4,Quite enjoyable,"This was a really good Charlotte & Thomas Pitt story. Even Charlotte's sister, Emily, was involved (posed as a maid in a household to try and solve the mystery). The end was quite a surprise."
4,Silence in Hanover Close.,"This book shows Victorian England in the way the aristocracy treated the servants and their attitutde to the ""lower classes""."
4,The Pitt's,"I enjoy a good mystery and the setting in old Londonwhere ""society"" reigns adds to the package. The bookis well written and an easy enjoyable read for thosewho enjoy period pieces."
2,disappointing,This book is not comparable to other Perry books....the book drags on and on with very weak plot and then suddenly during the last 15 pages brings a surprising end.. but I had really to make an effort to continue reading. in general I find the Monk series much better!
3,Big Dave,"This is a different DAM than I had hopped it was. I saw a DAM at a small Northern Minnesota (Rutledge, MN) Bar back in the late 1980s (while on a Rock Climbing Trip to a Rock Quarry in Sandstone, MN.) and they kicked but -- they were a 3 piece that covered everything from REM to Led Zep. plus their own stuff. These guys are OK but they aren't the DAM I was looking for of my drunken youth. Old Downtown Rutledge, MN. used to have 2 Bars, 1 Rock and the other Country -- I think both are now gone?"
2,The Natural,"Not a big fan of the way this book is written. Doesnt flow and is easy to put down and not pick up for a while which, in my opinion, is not how a good book should be. One of a few books I have read where the film is better"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A supremely outstanding baseball player is not supremely outstanding off the field, and ends up having a lot of problems because of his stardom and inability to cope with that in general.This book is ok, but as far as sport books go you can certainly get better and more interesting things to read than this."
1,Don't read if you like hope or happy endings,"I had to read this for class and was appalled at the prevailing message of despair and falling heroes and depravities such as rape. Please don't read this, it makes me sad to think of any one else having to suffer through this for a depressing ending. It's like Sweeney Todd; it doesn't get better."
2,The book and Roy Hobbs -- Both also rans,"If you want to read a well written book, this one is for you. If you want to read a good story, skip it. The author toys with the reader (or allows the reader to fool themselves) by making you think this is going to be a boy is good, bad thing happens, boy turns bad, man redeams himself story. The best line from the book that sums up the book and Roy Hobbs is ""Say it ain't true, Roy"". When you finish the last five pages you will be thinking the same thing."
2,disappointing,"considering the fame of this novel, I had the right to expect something more instead of a silly plot (very predictable and full of cliché) and a not particularly interesting style. I don't know what the main character stands for, but really it has taught me nothing."
1,"The Natural was a ""Natural"" porn","The Natural was very disappointing. It seemed a sports fans pornography. It described women's bodies in such an obscene way that it could make anyone blush. The use of sex to rush out of real life for Roy Hobbs was revolting and extremely dissatisfying. Bernard Malamud made it seem as if a baseball players life is all sex and money. I find this book unsatisfying and an utterly gross picture of the way Malamud describes life. The fantsies of these women were shown as carefree and a perfectly good thing. If one likes to read about sex then, this book would be a wonderful piece of disgusting and defiling literature."
5,The Natural by Bernard Malamud,Ordered a couple of copies due to requests by our clientele for classroom readings. It is very popular at our public library and has to be replace every few months. Loved the movie!
3,"Okay, would not read it again.",Hard to follow and super boring. I would not recommend this book to others. Great author b with lots of description but just not enough to keep you excited through the whole book.
4,The Natural,"The book was in good shape, exactly like what was advertised. I was pleasantly surprised & I am enjoying it."
4,A Dark Book about Second Chances,"When you pick up Bernard Malamud's The Natural, inevitably the Robert Redford movie creeps into your conscious mind. But this book is a far darker vision than the movie, and the end, with its even duskier conclusion about human fallibility, makes reading The Natural both sad and enlivening.The Roy Hobbes of the book is intent on getting his second chance as a major league ball player. The strain of misogyny in the novel is strong, and women are the element that continually fouls Hobbes' chance at success. This is an ugly part of the book, but in keeping with the overall gray moral sentiments expressed throughout. Hobbes is not the eunuch of the movie, and he is interested sex, money and fame as much as success in baseball (and he often views baseball as merely a means to that end).The Natural provides a hard look at second chances, and the inability of people to capitalize on them. Our first lives intrude on our second. We repeat the same mistakes."
5,Simply one of the best I have ever heard!,"Simply smashing! A number one success! You have seen the movie, now it's time to listen to the book. Blackstone Audio has a real winner with this audio version of a great novel about America's national pastime - baseball.The five 1-1/2 hour cassettes recant the life of Roy Hobbs a promising young baseball prospect from that farmlands trying to make it to the majors. Hobbs is sideline by a woman with a deadly bullet and after 15 years his dream comes true.The story tells about the ups and down of Roy Hobbs and the New York Knights baseball club. From the strange death of Bump Bailey to the wiles of sports writer Max Mercy, you be treated to a first class story and you'll find it hard to stop listening.The ending was a true surprise and a real pleasure. I enjoyed the listening and would highly recommend this to anyone. Remember the movie is the movie and as is most cases movies often fall short of the books they copy."
3,"Powerful, Well-Written, but Lacking","Anyone looking for a novel that's similar to thefilm adaptation will be mightily disappointed. Thisis almost nothing like the film adaptation of thesame name, especially when it comes to the conclusion.The novel itself is well-written and fairlyentertaining & absorbing, but it's a pretty good effortat best. Worth a read, but not necessarily incrediblymemorable. It's a shame, too, because much of the proseis so indelibly beautiful that I wish the overall plotwere better."
2,"Although I am a fan of baseball, I did not like this book!","Perhaps I did not like this book because I was forced to read it. Perhaps I did not like it because I am over critical... At any rate, I absolutely did not enjoy this book at all. Bernard Malamud created a sex-crazed, egotistical moron who was better at hitting a ball than making passes at women. Malamud opens with a young, green, 19 year old Roy Hobbs who is too shy to order breakfast, but not shy enough to try to touch a woman in a *personal space.* After an unexplained 15 years, Roy comes back, plays great baseball, and brings the underdog Knights to the Penant. What I don't understand is, why did Malamud decide to end the book like he did! I won't give it away, in case someone actually wants to read this book, ..."
2,A sad and depressing tale of a coarse fool's downfall.,"Having first viewed the film of the same name, I found this book to be disappointment. It lacked the mythic and Arturian aspects of the film. Roy Hobbs is a coarse, unpleasant and not too bright character whose downfall is painful to follow. After finishing the book I felt the urge to take a shower, there was a feeling of being defiled, and certainly saddened by this account of a unfulfilled and wasted life. For once, a film adaption was better than the book."
1,"don't bother, watch the movie instead",this is one of those rare instances in literary history when a film adaptation of a book is far more complex and inspiring than the book ever hoped to be. The addition of the Glenn Close character as having been a childhood sweetheart tied the film together with respect to Roy and her relationship much better than Malamud did. Roy's character is a shallow and selfish man who doesn't know a good thing when he sees it. The film's Roy at least has a sense of what is right and wrong(in some areas of his life). My advice to anyone is to enjoy one of the best movies ever made and forget about the The Natural by Bernard Malamud.
1,Worst Baseball Book Ever!,This is absolutely the worst baseball book I ever read. I wasted my money. Save your money; go rent the movie.Spoiler alert:Hobbs sells out and strikes out.
2,The movie is just better,"The Natural by Bernard Malamud is consistently lauded as the best baseball book ever written (along with Bang the Drum Slowly, another egg), and while it wasn't a bad read, I certainly don't put it up there in the best ever category; but perhaps that's more about me than it is about the book.In one of the rare cases of the movie being superior to the book it's based on, Robert Redford's film `The Natural' is just a much much tighter and more engaging telling of the same story with a better ending, and in fact probably the best baseball movie ever. I found the book depressing and the Hobbs character not very likeable, while Redford is brilliant as the flawed hero Hobbs. You sort of get the sense that if Malamud watched the movie he might be thinking ""Dammit, that's what I wanted to do with the story!"""
5,Superman Decal,"The ""superman"" decal was exactly what we ordered. The colors and manufacturing is perfect. We had other decals in past and lasted a very long time."
1,Order Never Sent,"It has been well over 30 days and nothing. Left message for seller, no response at all!Amazon is now handling problem and has contacted me w/ an apology and notice of no charge to my credit card.Very bad business practice to not communicate to buyer."
1,Christmas CD,I did not receive the item. Also poor communication from seller. I WOULD NOT purchase anything from this seller.I am presently in a dispute with Amazon and the seller regarding not receive my Christmas CD Gift!
4,Relationships between generations?,"Turgenev is no Dostoevsky, but I like him. His thinking. Writing style. But most of it, his insights, into human behavior in relation to ""relationships"". I think D H Lawrence's Mothers and sons, was written in the same spirit. But the most interesting knowledge the two authors provided me with, is that the basic/intrinsic nature of human being has not changed much over the last century."
3,Terrible Translation,Turgenev is wonderful. This translation is awful. The translator does not / can not speak English. It's as if she did it with a dictionary and thesaurus and no working knowledge of spoken English. Also lots of typos in the Kindle edition.
1,Read the product dimensions,"The book is huge - almost 8.5"" x 11"" and thick as well. Also the font is ancient, it looks like it was typewritten. Don't buy"
3,Who is translating?,"The various translations of Fathers & Children (aka Fathers & Sons) by Turgenev are listed as available on Kindle. However, as Edith Grossman points out, translation does matter. I wanted the Pursglove translation but almost purchased the Kindle-available Caldwell translation just 'cause it's listed in all translations...a bit misleading..."
4,A good book.,"This book is a good book, and I recommend it to anybody who wants to read a book. I'm an extremely bad reader - and so may not have picked up on all the nuances, but at the end I was touched by that fuzzy feeling of truth one gets with good art. Is the end a little like D. Thomas' poem ""Mourning"" something or other - you know the one! - or was it my imagination."
3,Quick read a little fluffy,"I read this book with anticipation, since John chapter 15 is one of my favorite parts of scripture. The book was short--only 110 pages of actual text. And the way she presented the scripture did not have very much depth.The book was all right, but it was by no means outstanding. It did not challenge me in any way. I much prefer books like RadicalRadical: Taking Back Your Faith from the American Dreampersonally.It would be a good book for a new Christian, and would perhaps be a good book for a women's Bible study, but it is not a good book for someone who desires any type of depth or challenge.I would like to thank WaterBrook Multnomah for sending me a free copy of this book. They required nothing from me other than an honest review."
4,Discovering the Secrets of the Vine,"The Secrets of the Vine for Women, ISBN 978-1601423979, is a great little book that would make the perfect group study or personal devotional. The story is set in Tuscany with a daughter and her father as they discuss the wonder and workings of their family vineyard. Each chapter begins with a look into the life of this family as the father gently instructs and illustrates the secrets to the vines, all the while preparing his daughter for a future full of promise. What a great metaphor for our relationship with Christ as the vineyard owner and we are the vines. I found the simple truths wrapped in a visual word picture engaging, transforming and relevant. This little book would make a perfect gift for every woman in your ministry."
4,"Small, powerful read","Secrets of the Vine for Women is a great inspirational book about how God helps us to not only bear fruit, but to bear it abundantly in our lives. The author uses stories about a young girl learning from her father about how to tend a vineyard. The lessons learned in the vineyard are directly related to how God tends to us. The book is inspired by the book Secrets of the Vine by David Kopp, which I have not read so I cannot comment on the content related to it. This book was a small, but powerful read. The book contains thought provoking questions and a study guide. It would be a great resource for a women's study group.""I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review"""
4,Bearing Fruit,"note: I got this book for free from Blogging for books.What does it mean to bear fruit abundantly? Most people when they hear ""bear fruit"", it's to have more and more children to fill the earth. That's what some select groups say. But other people have no idea what it means to ""bear fruit"". In this book by: Darlene Marie Wilkinson, she explains the secrets of the vine for women. Her husband is Bruce Wilkinson and he was the one that wrote the prayer of jabez. When Darlene explains how we can achieve abundance through our blessings to other people, it made my heart feel very peaceful for some reason.I highly recommend this book to women all around the world who wants to ""bear fruit"" in abundance."
4,Secrets of the Vine,"'This book was a little dose of encouragement. A quick, simple read on a very meaningful passage of the Bible. It helped give a little insight into God's perspective on our circumstances -- good and bad.It's amazing how God used simple reminders of His Words throughout Scriptures that are still visible to us today. This passage focuses on the blessing of being deeply connected with God and what it means to bear fruit. ""As [Jesus] talked, I believe He was pointing to a branch, to leaves, to a vine. But He was looking right at His friends. With every word, He was thinking of His love for them, of the challenges they'd face, of the amazing and specific future God had in mind for each one of them. And I believe He was thinking of you"" (12-13)."
2,Secrets revisited,"How does a tender gardener raise a daughter? Secrets of the Vine for Women reveals a story that is heartwarming and shows you just how important you are to the father. There are charts and a study guide section.Before you read this book, I recommend reading Secrets of the Vine by Bruce Wilkinson. Secrets of the Vine for Women is written by Darlene Marie Wilkinson because of the overwhelming response from women readers of Secrets of the vine.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group and was asked to review it on my blog."
3,Good for a women's Bible study,"'Secrets of the Vine for Women' by Darlene Marie Wilkinson is the female version of 'Secrets of the Vine' which came out about ten years ago, and was written by her husband, Bruce. She draws on the experiences of women in particular to draw in the reader, and displays a gentleness in how she approaches her topics. A detailed Study Guide is in the back of the book, going chapter by chapter over valid questions that the reader might ask. It really is very suitable as a women's Bible study.I just wish it wasn't such a mirror image of 'Secrets of the Vine' and had more of an original feel to it. But still, for women who haven't read that one, they'll enjoy Mrs. Wilkinson's take on the same topic.(this book was provided free for me to review from multnomah publishers)"
4,Devotional,"This little book of only six chapters would make a good personal devotional. Because of the extensive Study Guide for each chapter, it could also serve as a source for a group Bible study.A frame story, set in Tuscany, about a vinedresser instructing his daughter in the art of growing a bumper crop of grapes is the metaphor for this study of John 15. The reader quickly sees that she is the daughter, and God is represented by the father, the vinedresser.Thank you to Cindy Brovsky at Random House for my copy."
4,Each Woman's Branch is Different,"I wasn't sure at first how God would use this book when I first got it last year. However, I didn't know that I would need it a year later today. The book is for women and our tendencies on how we sometimes prevent God from giving us the life he planned. I did love how Darlene Wilkinson uses John 15. She broke it down in such a way that it became clear the small things in my life mattered for Christ. In doing those things I thought wasn't important I actually bear fruit for Christ! He doesn't expect any more from me then what I am capable of in my everyday life. There were a few parts of the book that were confusing for me. I didn't completely understand her explanation of pain existing in punishment but not in pruning. So that was kind of clear for me. I would recommend this book for women who are struggling with feeling like they aren't baring fruit for the Lord and women who want to bare more fruit."
5,Love it!,"This is a handy little tool! I am a medical student and was looking for an all-in-one that I could use while in school. It is extremely handy and I was surprised at how quickly it shipped. Great service and product, would definitely by from again :)"
3,5 in 1 neurological PINWHEEL,"It's a good product with a very good design idea behind, except the rubber tips on the reflex hammer come off too easily. Overtime, I may lose them and I don't think I can use the reflex hammer afterward. I may have to glue them in."
1,Its a toy...,The product is badly crafted..comes apart. It is too light to work as a good tendon hammer...you shouldn't be using the same pin on everyone and I am nearly positive the tuning fork does not vibrate at the said frequency...very bad product...do not be tempted by the 5 in 1 thing...its useless!
3,didn't use as much I wished,"purchased this during neuro rotation. used during that month. patients would give wierd looks when you start unscrewing things, and then I realized this is probably not the most hygenic thing either, and therefore I stopped using it."
2,Obnoxiously large,"Item does everything as pictured. Just not machined nicely, pretty big and bulky. Not going in my lab coat pocket."
1,Not what it was cracked up to be,I tried it for 2 weeks and never could get it to hold the HDMI connections for the video. I don't know if the unit was defective or possible user error but after numerous hours trying to get it to function properly I give. It seemed too good to be true at the 600 dollar price. I'm sure it works well for some people but I did not think a masters degree in electronics is necessary to listen to good quality music.
2,"Works OK when it _does_ work, but is unreliable.","I got this shredder because it was supposed to shred up to five sheets at a time and accommodate staples, and because I found it on sale. However, it has been a disappointment from day one. Even three sheets taxes it and slows it down. It jams easily, and the reverse function only clears about half the jams. To clear the rest, you must unplug the shredder, lift off the _very_ heavy lid, and meticulously dislodge every tiny piece of shredded paper, which can take 10-15 minutes. It is difficult to place the shredder lid back on the canister. On the positive side, staples are handled with ease."
4,My cat did not like them....,I was so excited when I bought these thinking my cat would love them. However that was not the case. For some reason my cat was afraid of them. They bounced and jingled (a bell is inside the star) just like her other toys.I ended up giving them to a friend who has 2 cats. Both of her cats love them and go nuts for them! I am giving this toy a rating of 4 based on the reaction from my friends cat!
2,SPECIAL DIRECTORS CUT,"Yo yo what up G? Dis movie is sweeeeeeeet! And for reals yo, you get the extra special, dopey dope suger sweet fresh Directors Cut yo! Word yall yaheard me......."
5,"Stylish,durable and comfortable boots!","My 9 year daughter started horse riding lessons and these were the boots we chose to start with. They are very ""pretty and really cool"" she states. I absolutly agree. They are comfy, long-lasting and affordable as well. The silver toe tip gives the boot great style. Thumbs up for this product!"
5,The Cowboy Kid,"A beautiful pair of boots. I can not wait to see my son's face when he sees them! They really are the genuine artical. Keeping everything crossed that I have got the size right! Had to convert from UK to USA and then go up a size. These boots would make any young man (or girl) who dream of the Wild West, feel like they have made it!"
1,I HATE THEM,I think that they are a load of !$%@! They are over-priced and my child doesn't even fit in them!! I HATE THOSE BOOTS!!
4,DETAILED REVIEW,The first match with flair vs mvp was boring. Nothing even happened. I give it a 2/10. The second match with jericho vs jbl was still not an eye opener but a bit better. 4/10. Now edge vs rey mysterio. It was okay but why was mysterio getting booed? And it was in edges heel days so of course he used vickie to win. 5/10. Next is jeff hardy vs randy orton. Nothing to say. Boring match. 1/10. The royal rumble event made up for crappy starter matches 10/10
3,A Not So Royal Rumble,The 2008 edition of the Royal Rumble lacked something for me...Ric Flair defeated MVP in a match that was plodding and sedating to me as the watcher. The Savior Chris Jericho went bezerk on JBL with a chair as part of a fued that I don't recall going much of anywhere and even the Rumble match lacked a bit of star-power after the Undertaker-Shawn Michaels left. Although the crowd did seem reasonably excited for the showdown between Triple H and John Cena. The part of the Rumble with Piper and Snuka was kinda sad two guys nearing sixty staggering around the ring getting their licks in on guys half their age before they where mercilessly eliminated by Kane. Randy Orton and Edge retain championships as the Road to Wrestlemania begins.
5,Worth every Penny,I work in a fine-jewelery store where we sell a lot of loose diamonds. This is a great loupe! The first one I had wasnt a triplet and was not very easy to see through. After getting this one Im amazed at how clear it is and how many more details you can see. Even the tiny hammer dents in the gold settings. There's no distortion in the lense at all. It even comes in a very nice leather protective case. Looks very nice and professional. Im very happy with this purchase.
4,Good Buy!,Good Buy here compared to same item selling elsewhere. Arrived quickly and little leather case is appreciated to aid in carrying it and not scratching it.
4,Good Product and Good Price,"Exactly what I ordered. It bulges out a little bit, but it does fit. I cant complain, works just fine."
4,An amazing and very useful book,"This book is a delight. It has three parts. The first part, the theoretical presentation, is of exceptional quality.The second part lists some applications - this section is of lesser value. The third part offers C++ implementation of the presented concepts. This last part is less valuable. For instance, the authors begin the section with a presentation of ... C++ classes! Clearly, the authors are not programmers!Despite these shortcomings, this is an extremely useful and easy to read mathematical book - including non-mathematicians."
3,One of the Best Songs Ever and Some Average Songs,"The title song is so amazing that I don't even care about the rest of the album being bland. I bought it for the song ""November"" because that song is so beautiful."
5,GREAT BAG!,"THIS BAG IS HUGE! I CAN CARRY ALL OF MY BOOKS TO CLASS, AND PUT ALL OF MY IMPORTANT THINGS IN THERE FOR THE WEEKEND. A GREAT BAG!"
5,NEED TO LAUGH? THIS ONE'S FOR YOU!,"The Gentle Season by Dia Hunter is a fun-filled romp of a romance. The heroine, Alewine Jones, is a cross between Calamity Jane and Ma Kettle. The six-year-old child, Jezlynn, proves to be an even bigger stinker than the surprise one at the critter wash. While the child keeps gambler Nick Turner on his toes, Aly does her best to keep the to-die-for hero on his back! This historical romance is a keeper for readers who enjoy love and laughter."
4,Great for Your Barbie Girl,"This is a super gift for girls. It caught the attention of every girl at my niece's birthday party and the pictures were an instant hit. -- A nice 'Barbie' kind of gift without being overtly about body conscioussness or gender stereotyping. All in all, both my niece and her parents could feel good about the gift. And the little pictures made a nice addition to the birthday memories scrapbook."
2,"dax "" hair shaper""","Delivery was quick. Product it self isn't great. From the description I was expecting a pomade athletes shaper. This is just a slightly thicker gel. Not great, a little disappointment"
5,I love these shoes!,"Very comfortable, look a bit racy with their bronze patent leather (albeit with low heel). I wear them often."
3,Average live album,"Much as I love Spock's Beard, I can't help but question the motives behind albums like these. There is nothing wrong with the songs on offer, but a single disc and no new tracks, no new versions and no special extras at all, is hardly exciting.This album was released to tie in with the Beards recent tour with Dream Theater, and the set-list on offer is quite similar to the songs the band played on that tour. But is this really the a collection any curious newcomer will find all that exciting? I doubt it.So. One for the die-hards, but nothing more."
2,Don't Try Releasing A Poor Live Album At Home,"While I am a die-hard Spock's Beard fan, I question the decision to release a live CD that is only 50 minutes long with songs only from the last two albums. They easily could have fit ""The Light"" and/or ""The Doorway"" on here, the two definitive SB songs.The only song that sounds better on this CD than on the studio recording is ""Gibberish"". For some reason I can't get into that song in its studio form, but I absolutely love the live version. ""Skin"" also shines on this CD, mainly due to the added punch provided by 2+ people singing the chorus.I encourage anyone looking for a live album from Spock's Bear and order Live At The Whiskey and NEARfest."
3,2.5 stars,"Little if any variation on the studio versions of this material. All the cuts are from the two discs-Kindness of Strangers and Day to Night. Sound quality of studio material is also, obviously, better than live versions-Neal Morse's voice in particular fares better in the studio. So why bother. Stick with the studio discs-this one's redundant...Simon"
4,The Relationship Between a Psychoanalyst and Her Patient,"This novel tells a concomitant tale of a psychoanalyst and and her patient, a young woman who she is analyzing. Both lives are juxtaposed, making this book interesting and giving it a page-turning quality. The book is quite readable in an easy and fun sense."
4,At times overwhelming,"I read this book my second year of college since it was recommended by my psychology professor. The book is interesting but at times overwhelming as young Dawn goes on an emotional journey to find herself. Dawn exhibits classic casses of transference and depression, as she works with her therapist to use her past in helping her present and future.I recommend this book to any psychology enthusiast, although I have to give it 4 stars because its somewhat dry."
5,A must-read for anyone interested in analysis,"A snapshot of analysis in high resolution. I'm not someone who ever re-reads books, but I broke the rule on this one. A stunning piece of art."
4,Journey into the human mind,"Hard to put this down, even though it was difficult (disturbing) reading. Fascinating details of a patient's therapy with a psychiatrist. Many who are abused not only survive, but grow stronger."
5,"Amazingly useful, always reliable","This CD-ROM presents the most comprehensive literal translation of the Bible accompanied by the Oxford Companion, a virtual Biblical Encyclopedia, and the Episcopal and Common Lectionaries. The most outstanding feature to me is the ability to immediately view cross-referenced verses in the annotations. Also, the Lectionaries can be used to immediately find the readings required. And these are only the simplest features, there are many more complex searches available for those needing them.Of course the most uniquely valuable feature of this translation is the availability of the complete Apocrypha. Bit is is also outstanding for the high quality of the scholarship that produced such fine English prose and poetry. This CD-ROM is endlessly informative and a pleasure to use."
5,Bring It Back!!!!,"This CD is one of the greatest of all time, in my opinion. The smooth vocals, groovin' tweak on hip bop, as well as the 90's-flavored lyrics, put this one right at the top. I just can't understand why it's gone out of circulation. It must be one of those ""business things"". I've tried to purchase it for over a year now. Please, please, someone, anyone -- bring it back 'cause my teenagers took my two copies!"
3,Delving into the past not as rewarding as I'd hoped.,"I've been exploring a lot of new music lately, notably, Thievery Corporation, DJ Vadim, and all of Ninja Tune, as well as Air and Dmitri from Paris.I guess Amazon's recommendation program decided that since Stereo MC's was grouped into the same category as Thievery Corporation or Air, that I would be default enjoy it.Well, I remember a long time ago, when this record came out, and it got a lot of radio play. I liked it back then, but thought it was a fluke. It appears I was both right and wrong. The album wasnt a fluke, because there is a whole genre of music around it now... And at the same time, the album is just unfulfilling and not as soulful and enjoyable as contemporary music of the same Genre.So while it might be a ""collection piece"" -- something you would keep to round out your collection of a genre, or to pull out at parties -- it isnt really worth buying new, and never really offered me much ""new"" to listen to."
3,Good Driving Music,"I must say the only reason why I initially bought this album was because of the nostalgia of ""Connected"" and ""Step It Up"". After listening to the album though, I was pleased to discover a few gems like ""Ground Level"", ""Playing With Fire"" and ""Pressure"". But unfortunately those are the only songs that really stick out. The rest is just background lounge music. That said, this is still a decent album to listen to - especially on a long drive. I would have given this 2 stars out of 5, but I had to give it an extra star solely on the basis that this it is undeniably quite a creative and original record."
5,My Favorite Pop Album Ever,"This is one of my very favorite CDs; I've probably listened to it more than any other single piece of music I own. What John Woo does for action movies and Bill Clinton does to political speeches, the Stereo MCs do to hip hop: cool, effortless execution that leaves you amazed at their virtuosity. The lyrics are raw, seething, and rely not at all on shock value: there's nothing that would have to be removed for radio play, but the subversiveness of the lyrical themes are undeniable. Fine words, great music, not a bad track on the album: buy it!"
1,"If you know anything at ALL about computing, STAY AWAY!","It must be very difficult to bring deeply technical issues to an insanely non-technical reader base. In all of the Net Force books, Steve Perry tries to do so and fails. If you know nothing about how the Internet works or the basics of networking, and don't mind being fed absolute bull, then go ahead and read this book. But, if you know anything at all about these things: RSFE (Read Something Else)."
1,Write your own books!,"I have read about half of Tom Clancy's other books and they were phenomenal for the most part. I am an attorney and a pretty good writer. Cybernation was one of the worst books I have ever read. I read the entire book so that I would truly give it a chance to get better; it didn't! I am part of the force designed to protect the nation's infrastructure and this book was childish at best. I am sorry to be so harsh, but if you let someone put your good name on a book, you should read it first. Not to worry, every page has its own cliche. The end of the book, not to ruin it for you, ""Yep. And they lived happily ever after."" Great ending!"
1,"Shallow, trite, predictable... total waste of time!","I can't believe that something like this would be published under the name of such a respected author (Tom Clancy)... who, by the way, is not even listed the writer for the novel.I had admittedly high expectations when reading the book jacket, since the premise seemed quite interesting. After all, with more and more people 'living' online, it doesn't seem far fetched that the distinctions between online and offline communities (and their resultant challenges) would become increasingly blurred.However, this book utterly failed to deliver. While I kept expecting some inventive plot twist or thoughtful character development, what I got instead was embarrassingly adolescent writing and complete predictability.I can't even label this book as a guilty pleasure, since there was no pleasure in reading it, and the only guilt I feel is that I didn't recycle it after the 2nd or 3rd chapter."
2,time to quit!,"The characters are superficial, the story line (what little there is)is disjointed. There is a samness in all of the serie now, and this particular one reads like a tired, out of wind and out of ideas rerun: It's time to quit!!"
1,Unbelievable! It's so Bad!! :-(,"I wrote my review about 40 pages from the end of the book. I must now revise it and remove all points. This has got to be about the worst book I have ever read!!!I picked this book up because it was sitting there, I was out of reading material, and it had Tom Clancy's name on it. I was skeptical when Clancy hadn't written the book, but I thought that if he put his name on it, he believed in it.There is no story here. Nothing happened. Nothing! ... A few disconnected scenes of people practicing martial arts, some guy drinking beer in virtual reality bars looking for clues (ridiculously stupid angle), and a conclusion that must have been written in one afternoon because the author was bored. The problem is, as is customary, I read to the end of the book to find that out.... There were some parts that held some promise, but there is no coherency, and the conclusion is so bad that I wanted to destroy the book and any credibility it has. ..."
2,Weak writing and disappointing.,"On the plus side, the book was interesting enough that I finished it. However, when I bought the book I failed to read the small print and assumed the book was written by Tom Clancy. I think it is a somewhat sleazy trick to print Clancy's name so prominently on the cover. The writing is poor, and at times laughable. Even though I finished the book, I would not recommend it."
3,Decent,Not really sure what is going on here with his writing style. I kind of preferred the old plots like Bear and the Dragon. It is not that I don't like the technology based books but this is not why I started to read his books. I hope he goes back to old mainstay with the CIA etc.
4,A good read that encourages independent thought,"Cybernation does a good job of anticipating future questions that may arise with the growth of technology, specifically problems with the Internet & intellectual/corporate rights. They don't answer the questions for you though; which encourages the reader to think a bit.This book is interesting and an easy read. It has good character development. Cybernation deals with both the character's work lives and their personal lives which allows the reader to better understand them. Action scenes are primarily centered on the martial arts and are strewn throughout to keep your attention. I did not read the first five books of the series, but was able to understand and enjoy this book thoroughly.I'd highly advise this book to anyone just getting into cyberpunk or anyone interested in computers and possibilities of the Internet who doesn't have a lot of technical knowledge to begin with."
3,CyberNation - a new fantasy?,"It is understanable that since CyberNation is one of the episodes of Net Force and the main concern is the Net Force, the depth of the meaning of CyberNation is not fully developed and explored. CyberNation, substantially a good topic, is not only about the cat-mouse game, but also a story of human's colonization of the cyberspace. The interactions (or communications) between the CyberNation and the outside world is still limited to computers. Computers are some what physical; however, I think the idea of cyber is far more than physical, viz. metaphysical. Of course, it is impossible now to upload our consciousness into the cyberspace and let our consciousness live alone in the cyberspace. But, may be one day we will separate our awareness from our bodies to live in the cyberspace and become a ""real"" cybernational. I like the slogan the most: ""Anywhere, anytime, anybody you want to be - CyberNtion can take you there."" (93) Isn't it a fantasy that we desire?"
1,Disappointed,"I am always looking for books that will entice my 14-year old son, who so far does not enjoy reading, to love books the way I do. This book looked like it might be just the thing. I read the first 26 pages and found all the gratuitous sex in a book that purports to be for teens very unfortunate, to say the least. I will not be giving the book to him. I'm wondering if all the Net Force books are this inappropriate for his age group. I'm still looking ..."
1,Simply Horrible,"Up to this point, I have loved all the Clancy books I have read. This one was simply horrible. Please note that the author of this book is Steve Perry, not Tom Clancy, and it is not up to par with the works Clancy is known for.The story line is very simplistic and they characters are very one dimensional. About 50 pages from the end you could predict the ending with a good degree of accuracy.If you haven't read any of Clancy's books (the ones HE wrote), then pick one of those up. This one isn't worth the time or the money. Too bad 0 stars isn't an option."
3,Great backdrop for a story...so-so book,"Cybernation has a great backdrop...a virtual nation without geographical borders. I would have enjoyed reading more about the Cybernation itself. Instead, the book is a cat and mouse, suspense thriller. The plot and storyline are so-so...there's not much original here. However, the background of a virtual nation on the cusp of formation is exciting...and I would have enjoyed reading about that more."
1,What a mess!,"Amateurish and boring. I cant believe Tom Clancy lends his name to this tripe.Move along, nothing here worth seeing."
1,Cybernation,Tom Clancy needs to stop hiring other writers to write his books. It is obvious that this books was written the other listed authors and Clancy's name added to get the sale.
1,like the handle but it broke in half,I BOUGHT THIS A COUPLE MONTHS BACK I REALLY LIKE THE HANDLE I WAS CHOPPING ONIONS THE OTHER DAY TAPPED IT ON THE CUTTING BOARD TO CLEAR ONIONS THAT WERE STICKING AND POP THE BLADE BROKE OFF ABOUT 1 INCH FROM HANDLE AND it WAS A GENTLE TAP REALLY DISAPPOINTING BUT FOR THE SHORT LIFE IT HAD IT CHOPPED GOOD really liked the handle too bad the blade was so brittle
5,A must-have for anybody who likes mathematical-challenges,"This books is what every book on math olympiads should be, it deals with high level problems in a way that readers can easily follow; I also liked it because there are some problems who have many interesting solutions and generalizations"
2,"Good at first, but tiring","The book is good at first but one tires quickly after reading the heavy syntax and the similar style of many of the problem. For example, the authors avoid sums and binomial coefficients, and the problems that make this book interesting are nothing more than difficult theorems that you would find in any textbook on number theory"
5,Good Russian textbook,"I used this textbook in a 3rd semester Russian class. I was quite disappointed by Golosa and Nachalo -- they seemed to lack reasonable coherence and organization. The descriptions in V Puti are concise, well-written, helpful, and well-organized. You might want to read the table of contents, skip ahead, and find some neat constructs if your class has a composition component.Also recommended: Schaum's Outlines of Russian Grammar and Katzner Russian dictionary."
2,Its really only OK,"Our teacher is currently supplementing almost every lesson since the explanations and examples are poorly clarified too frequently to be excused.My guess is if your here you have no choice but to buy it, just think about ditching it the second your done with the course.-Rob"
2,Why is all the mints?,"Mint is not pleasant to have in winter time at all, just realize there is no winter in India where the Ayuvendic fomulla was made for. So a good formula for people live in India doesn't mean it work for people live in other part of the world."
5,"I ""gift"" this to everyone I know :)","This tea is so wonderful, delicious and makes you feel great. It definitely does help alleviate cold and sinus symptoms, and I'm convinced it helps immune function as well. It tastes so yummy though, I drink it almost on a daily basis along with all my other Yogi teas. I end up having to buy this one the most because I give so much of it away!"
5,BEST COLD TEAS,CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THESE TEAS KEEP THEM ON HAND ALL WINTER DRINK THEM IN EVENING EVEN IF IM NOT SICK TO KEEP MY SYSTEM WELL AND THEY ARE WONDERFUL IF YOU DO GET A COLD.
1,An insult to the original,"Why do excellent movies like Ferngully and The Land Before Time get such half-baked direct-to-video sequels? The depth, complexity, and offbeat spirituality of the first movie are all painfully absent from this godawful piece of garbage, as is Robin Williams' voice talent."
2,"Kids liked it, I was not impressed.","Although I LOVED the first Ferngulley, this one was pretty sorry. I don't think that any of the actors from the original worked on this movie. The guy that they got to take over for Robin Williams as Batty Koda sounds like a really bad impressionist. The kids loved the story in this one - the fairies trying to save poached baby animals, but I thought the story was weak. Whenever they watch it, I make sure to leave the room!"
2,Amateur effort with redeeming qualities,"The idea is good, but the charm is missing. Mediocre animation, decent plot but poorly carried out, actors that sound like they're reading the script (a badly written script...). For most people involved in its making, their movie experience is extremely limited--in several cases (especially with the actors), this is the only film in their experience at all. In short, not a true sequel to the original. But they get an E for effort, with a few highlights with creative ideas of what happens to little fairies when they get mesmerized by the world of a human carnival and forget about their true mission in life: to protect living creatures. It is a clean film which promotes good values and has nothing inappropriate for young viewers. Songs are so-so, even if they might be a bit catchy in tune. This has some entertainment value for the 3-6 age range, but anyone older than that will be quickly bored."
1,Donde Esta Robbin'?,"Robin Williams is god. I cried tears of joy when I saw him in the first Fern Gully. I replayed his voice recordings over and over until my parrot memorized it. Words could not express my happiness when i heard that there was a second Fern Gully.Much to my dismay, Robin Williams was not in this movie. I was sthuper pissthed off when I did not hear Robin William's seductive voice in this film. I tried to flush it down my toilet as well as burn it, but this VHS tape was indestructable. However, I love the elf with his shirt off, he is the Robin to my Williams.~*RoBiN wIlLiAmS 4eVeR*~"
2,Sorry :(,Ferngully 1 is classic. This movie was such a dissappointment to me. Some little animals get kidnapped from Ferngully so Crysta's friends go to human town to find them. the film was just corny and not interesting and the way that truck rolled down the hill in one of the scenes had me rolling my eyes- i know it's a cartoon but come on!!
2,Eh,"My entire family loves FernGully, but not a single one of us cares for FernGully 2. It was an overall let down for us, but maybe your family will enjoy it."
1,knock off,"This video was a COPY of the original. Whomever I purchased this dvd from, copied it and sent me the copy with the original case cover."
4,"Fern Gully's character ""Batty"" is very funny.","""Fern Gully The Last Rainforest"" by Century Fox Film Corporation is rated G for general exhibition.I am six years old and I enjoyed this film as the character ""Batty"" is very funny and makes me laugh. I liked the flowers in the rainforest. I also liked all the colours of the trees.By Tarni 6 years old Brisbane."
1,FernGully 2: The Magical Rescue Review,"THIS MOVIE STINKS TO THE 9TH POWER. None of the original voice actors repise their roles in this film. The animation is not as good as the first one. The story is nothing more then a bad road trip movie. The hero:Pips does little-to-nothing to save the baby animals from the 2D villians. Crysta who should have been the lead,instead of Pips. The rest are bland and forgettable. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
2,For Die-Hard Fans Only!,"As others have said, this is a very low-quality product. Looks like third- or fourth-generation VHS. When I placed my order, I assumed that it was an band-authorized DVD, but I can't believe anyone would want their name attached to this. The audio was okay (if that matters), with a few drop-outs here and there. I can't believe this is being offered by all of the major music retailers."
1,There Are Bootleg DVDs Of Higher Quality Than This Dog,"I put the DVD in my player last night and watched the first song.Do not buy ""THE REVEALING SCIENCE OF GOD"" DVD. The picture is terrible and the sound ain't too hot, either. My guess is this a someone's personal VHS tape of the TV show from 1998. It's terrible, picture-wise. Abysmal. This thing shouldn't have been released on DVD at all."
1,Is This Really An 'Official' Release?,"I cannot believe that this DVD is an Official release by Yes. The video quality is REALLY poor and the audio is only slightly better. The video resolution looks to be about 320 x 240. So when I play it full-screen on my 23"" Apple monitor, the pixel blocks are about half an inch square. I have seen Bootleg DVDs with better quality than this one. (I will not make any snarky comments about the band's post-Jon Anderson standards if they actually did approve this release.) I simply cannot believe that there isn't a better quality recording of the tour than this.I coud only recommend this disc, with the above caveat, to a die-hard Yes fan; someone who is aware of the disc's quality and still wants a visual record of the Open Your Eyes tour."
4,This is FAN material not for the average buyer,"Video production is discussed throughout and is weak, however, Yes, live, with the genius of Anderson, Squire, Howe, Bruford and the rest IS brilliant herein. More eye pleasing videos are available and better mixes are to be found for sure but what a treat to find this dvd, especially given the setlist. Classic Yes, later stuff and some interesting musician changes. I was at first dismayed by the video quality but listening to the music changed my opinion. I am a life long Yes fan and glad I found this unique item to add to my collection. The balance of the audio gives one a chance to enjoy new perspectives on all the material. BUY IT if you love the group, ah hell, buy it if you aren't...it will give you some entertaining insights to live music."
2,Budapest TV Show,This DVD being from Europe was originally done in PAL format. Somebody took the PAL footage and converted it to NTSC. When this is done it loses some quality. I have the PAL version (which obviously) is superior but still far from perfect. I got the PAL version for free in a trade back in 2006. The sound is good considering it's from a TV show. Good delivery!
2,buyer beware,"this is obviously magnification era yes (no rick wakeman). supposedly a televised concert. the video quality is extremely disappointing, the sound is lo fi (no surround). the performances lackluster and uninteresting, just going through the motions. i'm a longtime yes fan, and this is disgraceful. shame on you yes"
5,a classic,"This has become one of my favorite recent purchases. This is a lot of blues for under $8 (price as of April 2010).My main interest in this album was Red's New Dream; a hilarious tongue-and-check critique of the Internal Revenue Service. If you have never heard this song about the tax man, you need too!While the version on this album is exactly what I wanted, I've found myself enjoying the other cuts more than I expected. Red's version of The Same Thing is solid and he demonstrates his versatility on Freight Train to Ride and Louisiana Blues.In sum, this is blues."
2,A dissapointment.,"I thought this was a collaboration or each author contributing short stories. It was short sotires but i could not see the collaboration. We get different versions of the same stories. I am a Jack Ketchum fan. I have read and liked many short stories by Edward Lee. I expected better. It was okay. Read if you are a fan, if not, look for another body of work from these two."
4,Good Read,"I was not sure what to expect when I purchased this book, but I thought it was a good read. I purchased the kindle version for $4.99 and would probably not purchase the hardcover book. I enjoyed all of the stories, except for Masks. My only complaint (which is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5) is that the I ran into what appeared to be editor notes in the kindle version. Here's an example from sleep disorder: "" The benzothiamide (???Bensthiazide?) you were adding to his nighttime dose...."" This example was frequently found in the book with many different words. To me it seemed like someone was planning to look up the word, made notes about it, and then forgot. I thought this was very unprofessional and I have never seen this in a book before. Otherwise, the stories were great!"
3,"Quick Delivery, pook packaging","These nicer spark plugs are pretty much required in Saabs after 1999. So I just bought what I was told and the car is running fine.The way they were sent, the plugs were in small boxes somewhat loose inside a bigger box. The smaller boxes all opened and and all the spark plugs were loose when the package arrived. Luckily, I had just bought a gap tool and was able to see the factory gaps were not compromised."
3,A Guide to the Best Historical Novels and Tales.,I have not had the time to make a fair appraisal. After I have had a chance to read more I will make a more accurate appraisal.
2,Not very useful,"This guide had mostly very old novels listed, from the middle ages and up. It listed very few books in which I would be inteested."
3,Love Clint Black,"Listened on an old cd I had when I was down. It just cheered me right up but was scratched so ordered a new one. This is really good but didn't fill the bill for me. I wanted some of his lighter songs like the one with Uncle Kracker. Shall order another. But this one is good. Heck, he is good."
1,"Bad prose, bad characterization, silly plot","This was my first Peter Tremayne purchase, and it will be my last. Mr. Tremayne doesn't seem to know if he is writing a historical mystery, a fantasy novel, or a really bad romance. I finished this book because I couldn't believe it was so bad--it gradually assumed a kind of horrible fascination for me. The prose style is clumsy, the diction overblown, and the motivations are silly.If you want historical mysteries, stick with Brother Cadfael. If you want hokey but fun fantasy, read Barbara Hamblyn. If you want romantic mysteries, read Elizabeth Peters et al. Or read Lindsey Davis' ""Falco"" mysteries for a bit of all three."
2,the poor quality of the gilmore hose,the hose kinks all the time not as good as the craftsman rubber hose said it was com. grade i would say not
5,Great,Been using for a few months. It handles the hottest water setting on my hot water heater. No leaks and no burns.
3,Nice town hall,The shipping was fast and even though the USPS had messed up the box the product was undamaged. Looks good on the model railroad I am building up. All the pieces don't quite fit right so get creative.
4,Adequate Holds,"These legacy necessities hold about 90-120 minutes tops.Yay.I got two in case I really need the 180-240 minutes of production while away from outlet or solid ground, like mid air or at sea."
5,Excellent,"I like the aroma of this perfume, have sense of specific smell, i use it since 1995, cannot find in Asian region market"
1,Very unhappy,"With the great reviews I ordered this over a month before Christmas. Did I get it? NO. Two days before Christmas I get a note that this is no longer available from Nutricity, despite their page saying they are in stock and can ship immediately. VERY UNHAPPY Christmas for the family involved."
2,Broke on the second use,The trays looked great and was happy to receive them. I also thought it was clever to create the space for lime wedge. Unfortunately its must have been made up of bad plastic. One tray broke on only told the second time I tried to squeeze out the ice cubes. Very disappointed.
3,Snapped on Second Use!,"These are super duper cute - no question. And it's a great concept to be able to incorporate bits of fruit into the ice cube design. Unfortunately either I'm a hulking brute (I'm not) or they are cheaply made because in attempting to turn out only the second batch of cubes, the tray snapped in two pieces in my hands. Sad."
4,Superb stylist,"The obituaries of John Gregory Dunne led me to VEGAS, a fictionalized autobiography that cuts between the author's residence in 1970s Las Vegas and his youth of 20 years earlier in Connecticut. It is a strange book filled with fascinating Vegas characters -- the comic, the bail bondsman, the hooker -- and their back stories, played out against the author's life story and his quest for, what exactly? Well, he lives a disconnected life, and finds meaning in the stories of others, but doesn't want to get too close because that would require an investment in time and care he isn't willing to make. He is a reporter. He is also a brilliant prose stylist, very funny, sharp, with keen observational and descriptive skills. A terrific book."
3,"Not what I was expecting, but quite good.","I have only good things to say about the man John Piper, both as a theologian and pastor. I was however, a little disapointed with this book. I love all three of these Christian heros and was very excited to read about their lives and ministries especially agaist the backdrop of their blatent failures. Piper however, spends more time molding their lives into three preset themes he wishes to discuss then their lives themselves. His chosen themes are Sovereign Joy, Sacred Study, and The Divine Majesty of the Word.This book is certainly not a biography (something that is tipped off by its 150 pages of large type) but is interesting if you wish to read about all of the aformentioned ideas. It certainly is a quick read and worth the edification. I would reccommend though that after this book you read some of the men themselves to get a fuller picture of their lives and more importantly, how they display God's glory."
4,"Joyful, Joyful we Adore thee","Our devotion to God often gets mired in the traps and snares of everyday living. We fall into complacency or a feeling of inadequatcy to God's purpose. We then look to our historical, spritual fathers and feel that the zenith of their devotions is far beyond what we think we could ever achive. But, we miss that the nadir of their depravity is far beyond what most of us have ever had to face in the call to Christ.This book is brief in its number of pages, but the testimonies of their lives ought to help us become more desperate for God who out of His grace will return to us passion, devotion and joy. If God can use these men, He can use me. If God can overwhelmingly entrall these men, He can do the same for me. If God can bring joy to darkness in these mens lives, what will He do in mine if I devote myself to Him.I read this book in two days and it was well worth it"
5,Giants of the Faith,"The books in the Swan series are taken from a conference for pastors, where Dr. Piper presents these biographies. The biographies are never meant to be exhaustic treatment, but tailored to encourage pastors.I find these brief biographies to be so wonderful and often whet the appetite for more. One can only be encourage and motivated to do more for the Lord, having bathed the soul in these well-written, tailored sketches."
4,Solid Shelf,"Shelf was good quality if you use the rubbermaid shelving system. I use the entire rubbermaid system in my garage and it helped organize my entire garage, in which I used a half dozen of these shelves.Just be aware that the shelf is just a board that fits on your shelf system. You need the pieces that screw into the wall and the brackets that hold the shelf up separately.I rate this particular product as a 4 stars as it is just a board that fits on the shelving system that you could just cut yourself if you felt so inclined. The shelving system all total I would give 5 stars."
2,Measurements not exact,"This shelf is 47.5"" x 15.5"". The Rubbermaid label on the shelf confirms this. It is not 48"" x 16"". Be aware if you need exact measurements."
2,No Shelf was Included with the brackets.,"Of course I bought this to use as a shelf in the garage, though there wasn't one single shelf with the item. I'd contacted the seller and they said there wasn't a shelf included. Nice, huh. So, I'm not too satisfied."
5,Wow,"This is Chap Mei at it's best, (lontic is the stateside distributer). The set comes complete with HUMVEE truck, Dino, and loads of accesories. Normally these items are found only over seas, Thanks again Amazon for coming through with the hard to find items."
2,Bad Like a Badger,"Also sold under the name ""Black Diva."" A rich white NYC doctor has been married to a sexy moody black woman and they haven't had sex for 3 months. They have a Jamaican maid, and they just hired a Nigerian chauffeur. It isn't long before the maid and chauffeur are having sex. Then the maid gets fired and the chauffeur is ""coerced"" to have sex with the doctor's wife. The twist at the end was unexpected as there were no clues leading up to it. In fact the script was contrary to the twist. Acting was fair, script was bad. Low budget. The movie swapped back and forth between 2 songs as its soundtrack, one was Mr. Mister ""Broken Wings.""F-bomb, nudity, sex."
1,Vegan Beware!,"This item says that it is a good supplement for a vegetarian or vegan diet. It contains Marine Fish Oil Concentrate. Do not buy this if you are vegetarian or vegan. And please, Being Well at Hillcrest, fix the product description. There is nothing vegetarian about this product. The description is deceptive and misleading."
5,Posh by Porsche,"I was looking for a small sized plug & play high capacity external hard drive to back up all my MP3s and videos onto and found this.With a capacity of 100GB, it is small (about 1cm wider, and 2.5cm longer than my iPod) and extremely lightweight (180g), it is very convenient to carry about, and with a simple but sleek design by F.A. Porsche, it's not too bad to look at too.Supplied with a black, velvety pouch, it comes with USB and firewire cables, as well as a power cable (not needed, except for some laptops which may limit the amount of electricity provided by the interface cable, according to the manual). Data transfer is rapid (I use USB 2). So far, I'm a happy camper!Great product!!"
5,Does the Job,"Device works exactly as expected. I am using it with a MacbookPro via firewire and an XP laptop with USB. Works great with both and I can transfer files between. Device is light, reliable, and fast. More expensive than other versions and brands but worth it."
5,was what I needed,"I'm following the Vaso Guard therapy from ""What your doctor won't tell you About Hypertension"". The author has a list of vitamins,etc to take and lists specific forms of the vitamins.The author (also a doctor) really emphasized the benefits of celery. He suggested either several stalks of celery a day or a celery extract."
4,works for me,"I have been using the celery seed extract for about a year now... at my last blood work the doc congratulated me on my good health and keeping my blood sugar under control and almost in the normal range now. My good cholesteral had escalated and my bad cholesteral had decreased. The doc told me to keep doing what I was doing. The only thing that I had done different this past year, was to add the Celery Seed Extract to my diet... so I am still taking it and will do so on a daily bases."
4,celery seed extract,"Celery seed extract helped lower my blood pressure.I didn't want to go on blood pressure medicine, so I decided to use this product first. I also heard that this product is great for lowering uric acid levels."
4,Good stuff,"The order went through very smooth and was delivered on time. I was only disappointed that the extract is not the celery oil, but I guess this is my fault as I should read the description more carefully."
1,ugh... pesticides?,"Because celery is on the dirty dozen list, why would anyone put a concentrated amount of conventional celery in their body. I fully believe in the benefits of celery as I do many other natural, God given foods, but in the case of celery it must be organic for me."
4,Poetry With A Political Statement,"Death row intimate, Reginal S. Lewis offers up a collection of poetry that offers an impactful punch. The book is a gathering of 69 poems divided into four chapters, which are titled ""Upside Down,"" ""Outta My Head,"" ""Literary Love Affair""and ""Inside My Head."" There is something for everyone in INSIDE MY HEAD.Lewis' point of view may be different than that of the average reader, however, he writes with compelling passion and the reality of life. My personal favorite is a poem titled ""A Place Called Lonely."" To me, this poem spoke to the trials and tribulations a Black woman suffers at the hands of general society on a daily basis.Reviewed by Nedine HunterThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
4,a remarkable mind,"""His poetry reflects a remarkable mind and speaks to a wide spectrum of issues and human conditions.""Midwest Book Review"
4,So far...so good,"I started reading this book yesterday and I'm halfway through it. So far, it's pretty good. I wouldn't a young kid of the age of nine or ten to read this book due to the content and the foul language. Teen girls would like this book because there's always something juicy that's either happening or going to happen."
3,Morgan's Makeunder,"Morgan is a teenage star, an actress who loves spending money and living it up. After overdosing at the Viper Room and nearly dying, then spending time in rehab, she is sent to live with her mother's best friend in Indiana. She must attend a public high school for a year as Claudia Miller and let no one know who she really is, requiring a ""makeunder"" to disguise her famous face.This book was written as a journal, so it's easy to stop and start. Though a tad predictable, as any 'secret identity' books are to me, it was surprisingly decent. Morgan has issues - big ones, beyond her materialistic ways - that come out as the story progresses. Make sure to check out the other titles in the series. The second book, More Confessions of a Hollywood Starlet, picks up right where this book left off."
2,Unexpected Texture,"Received this product today. The direct application of the surface to hardboard is a great idea, and in the event of errors, all but the darkest colors can be washed away.I just don't like the surface. It has an unpleasant feel during application, and wastes color. If you examine the enlargement of the surface, what look like tiny dots are like exploded bubbles of an epoxy-like material. It's rather like trying to apply pastel to 80 grit sand paper."
4,Very nice and a terrific price,"This is softer, more durable, warmer and nicer looking than a similarly priced sweatshirt. I plan to order more.p.s. The sage color is grayer than I would like. The orange is vibrant, the red is too bright and the maroon is a bit aubergine. The colors were all washed together and the red didn't leak onto the sage.pps. Turfer is infuriating because after not receiving a response to my inquiriy re a nonworking coupon code, I went ahead and placed a larger second and final order after which the coupon code was activated on Amazon along with a free shipping promo. ARRGH.ppps. Turfer fixed the problem for me. Thank you."
4,Ordered 2 different sizes,I ordered these in 2 different sizes because I wasn't sure at the time how accurate the descriptions were. As mentioned by other reviewers they do seem to run large. I got a Large and an X-Large in Burnt Orange (Hook 'em Horns!!) and a Sage. I don't care for the sage color. It's almost a drab olive. The orange is a good bright color. So I'm very happy with the V-neck style and will order some more while they are at $14.95. A great buy even though I have to pay shipping.
5,Nice Sweater,"These are really nice sweaters. But, it would be nice if they were made with cuffs on the sleeves. As some had stated, the sizes do run a little large. I usually wear a Medium but purchased three sweaters in the Small size and they fit just fine. One thing that I did notice however, was that the the sleeve length on all three was slightly different...one a little long, one a little short, and one just right."
4,very useful and has lasted for about three years of weekly wear,I bought about eight of these to be worn mostly at home. The Sage is the least flattering color. The shoulder seam split on one of them after three years and needs to be resewn but otherwise this has been a great value. Machine washable and dryable
4,Got the orange one,"Got this within a few days of ordering, and that same day toted it to an outdoor event. Cold, rainy, icky. Wearing a couple layers under this soft, fuzzy shirt kept me warm! I ordered it one size larger than ""normal"" because I like pullovers to be roomy. It's kind of like a slightly fitted guys fit - the sleeves are long but the shoulders fit. It's survived one washing just fine so far."
1,Hearsay Hunter Spencer Embarrasses Himself,"In this often-tiresome made-for-TBN tome, Spencer denounced so-called Christian ""heresy hunters"" for publicly criticizing other Christians without ever bothering to talk with them ... and then proceeded to publicly criticize them without ever bothering to talk with them. Go figure.Spencer attempts the impossible -- or at least the impossibly stupid -- in defending pseudo-Christian con-men like Robert Tilton, Bob Larson, and Mike Warnke. And the specifics of his defense are in many respects comical. God forbid that anyone in the secular community should, for example, see the incriminating details of Larson's 1991 divorce.Like Warnke and Larson, Spencer has been caught in an attempt to overstate his personal credentials, fraudulently palming himself off as a ""former AP journalist"" when his only experience there was a three-month internship writing copy."
2,Battleship Potemkin DVD,"This Battleship Potemkin DVD is a glimpse into the lives of Russians just at the time when the era of the Tzars was coming to an end. Black and white, and a SILENT film, often a bit dull, but it will give you a perspective of Russian life that you will probably not be able to see anywhere else. Especially for fans or students of Russian history."
2,Russian classic has little for the modern viewer.,"A movie that contains some very clever sequences and shots, particularly those of the massacre on the steps of the city. There isn't much of a story though. It's more a snapshot of a moment in history, that of the Russian revolution, and where as, it may have had emotional significance for the Russian audience of the time, the same cannot be said for the modern viewer."
1,"yes, I've seen this propaganda piece","Yes,I had seen this propaganda piece and this is all to this flick and its not my opinion but fact of life as everything from Russia is propaganda and I claim it as an ex-citizen of said/sad/junky/lousy place."
3,Well worth the effort.,"Remembering that the film was both a product and a tool of the Soviet political machine, the hatred of the Tsarists is evident throughout. It takes discontented masses and charismatic leaders to spawn a revolution. The seeds of discontent are graphically illustrated in this classic production. The charismatic leadership is not an issue in this movie, which is not surprising since they were no less evil then the Tsarists.The story is compellingly portrayed through the rapid transition of action sequences that should please even the short attention spans common in the MTV set. No Hollywood Pretty People in this movie, each is distinctive and right for the role. The grime on the faces, maggots in the food... the polished brass on deck, the bloodshed on the famous steps of Odessa... the story is a visual delight, though it was hard not to smile at the obvious propaganda promoting a classless society."
5,Classic cinema history at its finest!,Even the socialist propaganda cannot hide the wonderful work by Sergei Eisenstein and his cinematographer Eduard Tisse in establishing the basic theories in editing and montage. A must-see for every film student or general film lover.
5,AN EXCELLENT EISENSTEIN MASTERPIECE,THIS 1976 RELEASE ALONG WITH THE DMITRI SHOSTAKOVITCH SCORE IS THE EPITOME OF VIEWING AND LISTENING. THE SCENES ON THE ODESSA STEPS DURING THE MURDEROUS ATTACK OF THE COSSACKS IS AWE INSPIRING AND AN UNFORGETABLE EVENT WHICH SHOULD BE VIEWED BY OUR MODERN DAY F/X FANATICS. AS A NAVAL WORLD WAR II VETERAN AND PEARL HARBOR SURVIVOR I CAN REALLY APPRECIATE THIS FINE CLASSIC.
5,A Masterpiece of it's time,"If were to make a top 10 list for my favorite movies this one would be number 2. From it's time and Taking a film class I have been very open to watching silent fims and This one was the best that I have ever seen up til now. It shows on how things were developed into today's time with war movies and to the classic "" Odesa Steps"" scene, refering to The untouchables in 1984. It's a one of a kind masterpiece that all movie goers as myself will appreciate of it's time."
3,"yeah, but it's been censored","Note that the Republic Home Video edition of ""Battleship Potemkin"" (originally released on laserdisc in 1991) is of a version that censors the Odessa Steps sequence, specifically a second shot of the little boy being trampled on the stairs and the iconographic image of the bespectacled woman having her face hacked by a Cossak's sword. Speaking of hacked, Republic also released a version of ""Birth of a Nation"" (from the Killiam collection) 30 minutes shorter than the running time it listes on the jacket. Be advised."
1,Very low quality DVD,"An extremely low quality DVD. No opening titles, imageclouded and barelydiscernible at times, very poor sound (assorted noises),outrageously priced.""Enhanced edition"" is a joke.Avoid this DVD. Buy the KINO version."
3,Perhaps Eisenstein's Masterpiece,"In one violent but purposeful film, Sergei Eisenstein took the art of film out of the hands of sentimentalists like Griffith and pushed it, screaming, into the highest reaches of modern art. Eisenstein admitted that his film was given life by its bias; that, without bias there could be no ""why"" for a film. That he was rooting for the ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" is sometimes painfully obvious. Nonetheless, 'Potemkin' is one of those films without which so many later films would have been inconceivable. Grigori Kozintsev later admitted: ""Perhaps of all that he achieved 'Potemkin' was the only completed work, and that because there was no time to spare, no time to reconsider the problems."" Eisenstein's subsequent work has always seemed studied, exactly as if the film genius had had too much time to ""reconsider the problems."""
4,"The Brotherhood of Man, as it applies to the State","I think people are too quick to overlook the propaganda aspects of this film. While watching it, I was conscious of a blind commitment to ideology in the first part of the 20th century that would find its ultimate fruition in 60 million deaths. Invaluable as a piece of history (of both the world and film), but a great movie in itself? I can't see how one can remove a film's political subtext anymore than removing an actor or the way it was shot. Goebbels loved this film, by the way, -as good of an endorsement as I'll ever need."
5,NEVER give your only copy of this book away!,"We are never prepared for the loss of a child, yet this beautifully written, and compassionate book wisely prepares us for what comes next. Though we don't believe there will ever be a sane or normal moment again, ever so gently, author Rothman guides the reader/parent through stages of grieving and Kubler-Ross's stages of dying...and, we will survive. A grief counselor herself, Rothman shares her own and others' experiences of this incomprehensible pain. If there ever can be a ""guide book"" for the treacherous journey of losing a child, this book is the one. Succinct yet thorough, Rothman provides information about where to reach out for support from others, including a toll-free telephone number. Share the wisdom when it is needed, but NEVER, NEVER give your only copy of this book away!"
3,"Mostly Good, but CAUTION !!","I started thumbing through Wayne Dosick's Living Judaism, but when I got to the Afterlife portion, I was shocked. Someone taught this man that Judaism believes the same as Christians when it comes to punishment in the hereafter. Not so. We believe that the soul undertakes a spiritual ""cleansing"" of it's sins, but only for a maximum of twelve months. We only say Kaddish, what most folks would call ""The Prayer for the Dead"" (which is actually a misnomer, as it doesn't even MENTION death !) for eleven months, and not the twelve maximum, not wanting to believe anyone would require the maximum. Rabbi Dosick mentions Hell, which is not a Jewish concept, and eternal damnation, also not Jewish. Other than these things, I found the book very informative, and a good beginner book for anyone wanting a solid intro into the world's oldest monotheistic religion"
4,"Great Overview, Showing Orthodox and Liberal Views","Rabbi Dosick has compiled a wonderful introduction to Judaism that provides a clear window for the outsider to peer into this historic, sometimes puzzling, world that is Judaism. Broken down into logical categories, the book is also indexed, so it can be used as an easy reference. Topics include descriptions of the various Jewish sects, Jewish holidays, the Holocaust, Jewish views of non-Jews, life after death, and discussions about all the major Jewish rituals. As three of the world's major religions trace their beginnings back to Abraham, this book should prove a help to most who are unfamiliar with their ties to Judaism."

3,Fun Film - Okay Transfer from Cheezy Flicks,"Destination Inner Space is a classic b-movie monster flick with a solid cast, a great monster suit, and some pretty dodgy miniatures. The cast is good, the acting mostly competent, and it's even got a few good scares. Four stars for the movie itself (if you're a b-movie fan, like me).The Cheezy Flicks transfer is very similar to a copy I'd obtained on DVD-R previously; in fact, I'd say that it's the _same_ transfer, but Cheezy cut out the opening logo of the original production company and replaced it with their own. They lose points for that in my book. Give the original its due, even if it's public domain.The transfer itself is pretty good, but not DVD quality. I was really hoping for a fully remastered copy of the film in DVD quality. Still, this is much better than no version of the film at all, and should serve as a good introduction for the curious.I, however, will be waiting for a full digital transfer in the original widescreen format."
3,destination boring.....,"good for a lost weekend,or if your haveing trouble sleeping..everything is bad,the script,the plot,the sets,and the acting...buuuuuuuuuut the one girl is cute...and the monster,that looks like a giant goldfish,only blue...is well do i dare to say ok...so if your a hardcore b-movie person..(thou i think cheesey would reject it),rent it..don't buy it...who knows maybe i need to go back and seach my inner b movie soul...on this one...naaaaaaaaaaaa..."
4,Shades of Irwin Allen,"Possibly a copy idea from Irwin Allen's watery productions. Very good color with quality directing and a bit hamming acting, which fits the flick. A superbly entertaining movie from 1966."
5,Excellent organizational tool!,"I keep a journal for all my various responsibilites (home finance, church records, homeowners association records, important notes to remember, and a host of other entries). This record book allows me to keep everything in one place and is very convenient for being and staying organized."
5,JUST WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM DIANA ROSS AND THE TEMPTATIONS.,"LOVE THE WONDERFUL SMOOTH VOICES ON THIS CD!!! THIS IS A WONDERFUL COLLECTION THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING EVERY YEAR. LIGHT, BRIGHT, AND WITH THE CLASSICS LIKE ""SILVER BELLS,"" ""MY FAVORITE THINGS,"" ""WHITE CHRISTMAS,"" ""SANTA CLAUSE IS COMING TO TOWN,"" AND ""THE CHRISTMAS SONG."" WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY? WE ALL KNOW THE TALENTS OF THESE ARTISTS AND THE STAYING POWER THAT THEY HAVE HAD IN THE BUSINESS."
1,Inconsistent,"I purchased this product for my seven year old who has not been dry more than one night at a time since birth. Purchasing an alarm as an alternative to medication was highly recommended by our pediatrician. Prior to this point we have tried no liquids several hours before bedtime, waking him up in the middle of the night, etc. Needless to say, we were cautiously hopefull. Unfortunately, the alarm has been very inconsistent. Some nights the alarm sounds, and I am able to assist my son to the bathroom, other nights he wakes up with a wet pull-up and the alarm hasn't made a peep all night. This has been frustrating primarily because my son began to make progress in response to the alarm and started getting up on his own when the alarm sounded. At one point, he was even dry for a period of five days. The inconsistency of the alarm has really hampered progress and we are looking into a more reliable product."
1,Dri-Sleeper - Poor Quality!,"I purchased the Dri-sleeper for my son hoping it would help him. We told him how much this would help him and it barely worked for 3 days. He was unbelievably upset at how it failed over and over. I realized the main unit had an intermittent connection and tried to explain it to the help line. They kept insisting the main unit was fine and only the sensor needed replacement. In fact they repeated the line from the on-line documentation stating ""the sensor is a wearable item and should be replaced from time to time"". Are you kidding!! How ridiculous is that! I repeated that the main unit had a specific fault condition but the help line would NOT replace it. At this point we do not have a functioning bed wetting alarm for my son. My son, wife and I are very discouraged with this experience and think the Dri-sleeper product should be removed from Amazon!!"
4,"Eerie, man!","First of all, this is not a ""sound effects"" disc. This is New Age music of the spaciest kind. The best track on this for me is ""Traveling Without Moving"" - put this one on late at night with all the lights off and allow it to creep you out, which will especially be the case if you're into the mystery of UFO's, alien contact, etc. The cover art says it all - the music here very much lives up to those large black piercing eyes. I sincerely hope Phil Thornton records Alien Encounter, Vol. 2."
1,For completists only.,"Doesn't the cover say 'New World MUSIC'? This is no more than a collection of sound-effects. Very dull, lifeless and disappointing."
2,Not very helpful,"I live in a Natalie Howard house, but didn't get much out of this book. We were considering the addition of a guest house."
4,Nice knife set at a good price,"Ok, this knife set isn't quite to the quality of the 4-figure knife sets but, it's way better than that cheapo one you got as a college graduation gift. Just make sure you use the sharpening rod before each use."
1,Bad news,I purchased this last year and some of the tips of the knives broke off with regular use. I contacted Kitchen aid and they never responded to my concerns. Love other products but not these.
3,"Well organized, but not for younger toddlers","I like the way this book is organized: the chapters are logical, there is a nice match-up in the back with milestones in the areas of cognitive, physical, and social-emotional development and activities to support development in these areas. Each activity lists materials, age group, time, and whether for a group or individual. HOWEVER, I bought this book with my younger toddler in mind and the majority of the activities are just beyond her. The activities are divided into age categories, with the youngest being 18-40 months. It isn't intended for 12-18 month old toddlers, and even of the 18-40 month activities, I find only a handful are appropriate for my 18 month old."
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping this book would give me great new ideas about what to do with my toddler but mostly it was just stuff any mother would have already thought of, I got about maybe 10-15 new ideas but I expected a lot more out of it."
5,Very Thorough Retrospect,"This biography is very thorough on describing the life and history of James Dean. From his childhood to an in-depth look at what he was like on the set, this book is great. The great thing is that the author doesn't concentrate on his sexuality through the whole book. A great tribute to an icon that will never die."
2,Tom was just having fun when this book came out!,A miracle a week for the old National Tattler.I would rather have alopathic surgery myself!
3,Traditionalist,"This photog is for traditional style photos. They don't have much style, which if that's what you like, great! But, for me, I like to put a little flare into my photos. This only helped me understand what some people might like if they needed me to shoot a very traditional style wedding. (AKA, no personality)"
3,10 years old now,"This book is totally based on shooting film, plus a lot of B&W, infrared and medium format. The pictures are nice but I think there are more current books that would be more helpful to the photographer starting out."
2,There's better,"I agree that this book is getting long in the tooth. Its completely film based and frankly its not that informative. You've got a lot of nice, if dated, pictures and a few cute comments next to each picture. Comments such as, ""Don't worry about how much film you're using. You're goal is to capture the excitement, sensitivity, and passion of the ceremony""(p56). That's about as good as it gets unless your looking for some info on the film types that she likes; or you want to hear for the twentieth time how much she likes her Hasselblad fisheye. I also own wedding books by Bell and Johnson which I feel are much better whether you're a novice or have some experience."
3,Waaay too old material !,"I was disappointed with the book because it was first published in the year 2000 and apparently it hasn't been updated ever since. The book talks a lot about how to abtain your best results using films! It stresses the importance of not worrying about saving films, it advises the photographer to shoot as much as possible - I doubt that is ever a worry for today's digital shooters. Wanna have an idea about how out-dated that is? Page 116 :"" ...In the mid 1990's Bambi made the decision to go proofless(...)To use Montage, send your film to the lab and ask them to put the images on a CD, or scan the negatives into electronic form yourself"" - That was one of the ""hottest"" pieces of advice on the book! The pictures are ok, nothing really impressive - It might work well for a beginner, though!"
3,this book is not for everyone,"if your looking for a book to help you on your way ,forget this one ! if you dont have hassleblad or other high end equipment' forget this book, if your not already a professional forget this book ,if your using digital media , forget this book, the book however does have some good pointers and suggestions, but if avant garde photography isnt your bag,,, forget this book. i was extremely disappointed in the way it seemed to just address the already established proffessional, and last if your not interested in black white and infrared film usage forget this book!maybe if this book was updated it would be better but that is a big maybe"
5,A great book on the the Art,This is one of the best exposes on the art rather than the technique of contemporary wedding photography. It is not intended as a beginner's guide to the technical aspects of wedding photography--although beginners stand to learn much from this inspiring book. But this book will be of most benefit to more seasoned wedding photo artists interested in broadening their horizons and capturing a visually more demanding and sophisticated wedding market. To date there is no better book on the art of sensitive insightful wedding photography.
3,"decent, but starting to age","The imagery in this book is of a fairly high quality. The locations and scenes look believeable; nothing over-the-top and extravagent like some books show (by that I mean, obviously created by wedding photographers who shoot only for the wealthy in the best locales). The complete lack of digital is a real weak point to this book. As of the time of this review, I'm told that nearly 95% of wedding photographers shoot digital, especially starting out. Therefore the equipment suggestions, while still somewhat informative, are heavily dated (the primary emphasis on medium format, while compelling, is no longer the most efficient way to get going in the business). The images are all high quality and quite inspiring. It's a decent work, but I'll probably buy a few more wedding photography books before finding the one that does me the most good."
4,Above the normal beginner's guide!,"Although this is an excellent book for the beginner, I believe that those with more experience will find it most helpful. You should be thoroughly familiar with f/stops, film speeds, and shutter speeds to get the most from it. Above average information and ideas will be found within. Truly inspiring examples throughout. And the sections on the business side contain much useful information for the beginner on up to the advanced pro. Pay close attention to the details of light position, many things that the beginner and pro normally don't think about watching for. I received this as a gift and have absolutely loved having it. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
5,This book rocks!,"If you are going to buy only one book on the subject of wedding photography, buy this one. Over the years I have read hundreds of books on the subject and have been disappointed with most of them. Bambi Cantrell's images are art in every sense of the word."
5,Phenominal,"I've been a casual photography for a few years. I was recently approached to photograph a wedding and after much agonizing I accepted. I immediately began searching for books on wedding photography and saw this one. I must say that the reviews are well deserved! The book is fantastic from beginning to end and just what I like, capturing the event as it happens (true photojournalism). The pictures are phenominal and explanations and techniques are very helpful and an easy read. I am now no longer nervous to shoot weddings thanks to this book! Great Job."
2,A Lone Dissent,"Everyone loved this book, so I bought a copy prior to my daughter's wedding. I am not a professional photographer. I am a lawyer by trade.I was disappointed by the lack of any discussion of digital camera techniques. The word ""digital"" is nowhere to be found in this book's index. There are many suggested techniques for film and developing, but much of this has no application to the digital realm. The implication of this book is that if you are not using a Hasselblad you are out of tune. I would suggest instead that the writer join the modern world.Secondly, I was disappointed by the rambling style of the discussion. I know it is likely my professional bias, but I wanted a comprehensive table of contents with a thorough discussion of each point. Instead, the book's style is more of an informed ramble.Yes, the book has many pretty pictures. But this is not the up to date and well written book I had hoped for.E. Wickerpbase.com/wickerpix"
5,A Must Have Book,"You must have this book and read it... you will learn something and giving ideas... I do not mind what camera they used but the measurement of lenses is very important... I searched throught out the web site... my conclusion are most of wedding photographer I counted used 35mm, 50mm, 85mm, 100mm and 300mm. My attention is to shot portrait and wedding therefore I bought 50mm and my 85mm is on the way but I could not afford to buy the rest might be the wide lens and zoomsWas this review helpful to you? (Report this)"
2,Outdated,"The original publishing date for this book was 10/2000. That said, the author talks about photography in terms of film, not digital, techniques. Which in and of itself is very sparse. There are many pictures both color and black and white, but not much else. A good book for inspiration perhaps, but if you're looking for something more in depth, this is not it. Barbi Cantrell is a wonderful wedding photographer and may give great seminars, but those are lost in the translation of this book."
3,So far so good,"Although a bit outdated in regards to software etc, the skills, tips and techniques are as good as ever. Hope to put in practice some tips soon."
5,Ths best wedding photography book I have read,This book is a must have for any photographer that wants to learn about the current trends in wedding photography. The book is filled with the advice of one of the most successful wedding photographers in the country. It is well written and the photographs are first class. This book has had a great impact on my wedding photography business.Juan Carlos Torreswww.juancarlosphoto.com
5,Wedding photos is about getting the feelings !,"This book is really about the ART OF WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY. It's pro-driven, so you won't find that much on things like how to set up your camera or lights. But it explains in details how the authors get the feelings in the weddings, where they are and how to catch them. It's a GREAT book with wonderful insights and explendid photos (also with technical information like film type, f/stop, shutter speed, etc for each photo). Also very good opinions on how to set your business if you want to be a wedding photo pro. Thank you Bambi, it's really a wonderful book."
3,John Loves Mary,This is a film adaptation of a successful Broadway Play. It is Patricia Neal's first film. Ronald Regan does his usual low key performance. Wayne Morris is vey funny as well as is Jack Carson as Ronald Regan's ex-army buddy. The scene where Jack Carson in civilian clothes takes over for Wayne Morris announcing immediate seating in the balcony of New York's Strand Theatre is very funny especially for those of us that remember the announcements from the uniformed staff in the movie palaces. The very fine actor Edward Arnold who plays comedy equally as well as drama is excellent as Patricia Neal's father. Paul Harvey as the army general is also very good in his role as a pompous autocratic general. I waited a long time to see this film on DVD and the wait was woth it. The only thing in this DVD is that the selcted scenes are not indexed and one has to go through 10 minute segments to get to the desired scene.Barry Goodkin
4,deep movie about a previous time,"the story is about a time gone bye and customs no longer used, excellent acting unusual use of a young boyto be the narator"
2,Huh?,"1941 must have been a barren, rotten year for filmgoers. How else could this jumbled affair have won five Academy Awards? How Green Was My Valley is a fine film but in no way is it worthy of such praise. Did it stay true to the original novel? If so the original story isn't that good. What's up with the sister's marriage to the coal mine owner's son? Where in the heck did that come from? And Huw (played by Roddy McDowall at his most dimwitted) decides to become a coal miner? Huh? Shouldn't this story have been about the changing times and economy in Wales? Shouldn't it have been about transitions? About how the narrator went to school and escaped this dead-end trap of the coal mine? I'm Welsh in heritage; I really wanted to like this film. Do yourself a favor and skip this stinker."
4,Touching melodrama,"This film traces the changes that befall the Morgan family and the Welsh mining community where they live as the pressures of capitalism and industrialization put an end to a gentle way of life. The narrator prefaces the story by acknowledging the tendency of memory to amplify our primary impressions of the past, thereby setting the stage for some of the rampant sentimentality to follow. John Ford's film is melodrama rather than a deeply insightful look into the human condition, but it is affecting, nevertheless. The film provides some much needed balance by treating such issues as unionization, environmental deterioration, and the corrupting effect of poverty and unemployment on the human soul. There are many fine performances, including Roddy McDowell when he was just a little chimp."
5,A beautiful Classic,"I believe everyone should see this movie! It is a classic of American movie making. I loved it because of the great acting and wonderful directing. The story line is beautiful too reflecting a time in history that is in the family history of many Americans. It is a tear jerker but not in a silly sentimental way. Of course, you can find flaws and anachronisms but still it is a must see classic in my opinion."
3,How bad was coal mining in human terms?,The Welsh mining town is the subject of this movie from the perspective of a young boy and his five brothers and one beautiful sister.The love story of the sister with the minister is told with the back drop of the boy losing his older brother and Dad and his four brothers leaving England.The mining remained a problem even until today is shown by a modern movie about a miners band that was popular.The unions have really only been partially successful in coal mining.Black lung disease and lack of real effective safety regulationshave made this one of the environmentally dangerous of moderntroubles. The sentiment of the movie doesn't change the long term human damage that resulted. The Welsh folk songs in the native languageare a treat as song by a large chorus.
2,"Great film, but DVD not great quality","How Green Was My Valley has been my favorite movie of all time for many years! I was delighted to add it to my DVD collection. However, there were spots in this DVD that broke up as if I was watching digital TV that was having satellite problems. In other words, the picture broke up into small rectangles. I have to wonder where the DVD copy was made. I wouldn't have given any stars for the quality of the DVD, but I did give it 2 stars for the great story."
4,"Great, old movie",Received quickly and watched it within a couple of days.It shows what many lack today -- a great work ethic and solid family values -- despite very hard times and many difficulties.Illustrates tremendous strength of character.
4,"How green was my valley, walter pidgeon, john ford",It was amazing how hard life was and how people endured the hardship with a grain of salt. Very strong characters portrayed.
5,Place to store all my cloth baby carriers!,"Three sections: wraps, pouches/slings, and ABC's (Asian Baby Carriers). Perfect. Plus room for clothes and little booties. :P"
4,handy to have,Every thing is great about this except how the hanging hook slides a little here and there. You have to simply slide it back into place by an inch or two. Not bad.
5,I love this organizer,"I've had this exact organizer made by Kolcraft in blue for nearly 2 years. I love it! My two sons share a room and closet, this allows me to keep all their clothes in the closet rather than use a dresser. I will probably buy another one when baby #3 arrives in February."
5,Great for organizing babies closet,"I purchased this item because I have very little closet space. This organizer triples your space. It has two sections for hanging clothes. I use this to organize the clothes by size. Right now I have one section for newborn to 3 months, the other section for 3-6 months. I use the shelves for towels, bibs, hats, blankets, etc. It keeps everything neat and within reach."
1,It's not the play!,"I didn't see the other user comments when I ordered this. I must have been distracted. What a disappointment! I thought I was ordering a theatrical version - a play as I had seen it in 1978. Instead, it's an orchestral version with narration. If I want the music, I'll just order an audio. I can't see that this version does any justice either to the music or to the play."
3,a book that has two sides to it,"I first read Candide as a book, not a book I tried to see under its layer. The result was a fairy tale: a country where gold and precious stones are considered as nothing etc. The ending was very disappointing for a fairy tale. But after I read it, i realized there was an inside meaning, Voltairan philosphy. Then I saw how each event supported his philosophy. Overall, its a good but confusing book to read. One is required to look under the superficial meaning of the book and see how Voltaire mocks society. END"
4,A side of Japan rarely presented,"This book is rightly considered a classic, and his description of Miss Suzuki in the chapter ""Slaying Dragons"" is, oddly enough, one of the most erotic things I've ever read.
