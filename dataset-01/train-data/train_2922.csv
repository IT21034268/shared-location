2,This fan blows,This fan is moderately consistent with remaining on. There have three instances where I needed to reach in and jostle the power wires at unit side connnection to get the fan going again.I'm not sure I would buy this product again.
3,It's okay...,The first one started making loud noise on start up after about 2-3 weeks. The noise goes away in about a minute. RMA'ed it. The new one is holding out okay so far after a couple of weeks. The fan seems kind of weak though especially considering it's dual slot. Med and low setting pretty quiet. On High setting you can definitely hear it if you have a low noise setup.
1,Bearings noisy after 2 weeks,"I bought this fan to cool my Nvidia video card. It ran fine for 2 weeks and then became very noisy after about 2 weeks of intermittent operation. Would love to be able to contact the seller, but as of yet have not been successful. AVOID THIS PRODUCT."
4,Great idea!,"This is a great idea and it works well.I don't even hear it.I could care less about PC noise, if it is not like a crop-duster, buta little wind does not bother me.However, I was surprised at how quiet this item was being as big as it is.Great Item and great idea whomever came up with it."
4,Good Read,"Jerry Funk's writing style makes for an easy read and a very interesting story. He carries the reader on a journey through his life and career, ""stumbling"" from one experience to another. From Montana to Ethiopia through Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and South Africa, his time in ""Zaire"" (DRC) and Namibia make for an adventurous read. The author was funny and very irreverent and I picked up a thing or two from this book on how to approach work. :)"
3,"A little slow, but still good","This is not a fast paced movie, so don't watch it if your on the ""tired"" side or you might doze off. However, if you're looking for something clean that is mildly entertaining, then this is a good choice. There are a couple funny places in this film and it has a good ending."
3,Growing The Big One,"A single middle aged woman inherits a farm and decides to move to the beautiful countryside where it is located. She is a radio announcer that must balance her job in the city with running a farm. Fortunately her handsome neighbor is willing to help with the farm and her boss is interested in her rural life and allows her to do her broadcast from home. It turns out she not only inherited a farm but pumpkin seeds as well that may help her grow a prize pumpkin that can help get her farm out of debt. A good Hallmark family movie. If you enjoyed this, catchThe Good Witch.CA Luster"
1,More like free sample than collectible!,Was not happy with order at all!I would not call it a minature collectiblemore like a free sample! Will take blameshould have paid more attention to sizing.Felt completely ripped off - will not usethis company again.
2,Poorly written,"The language of this book is horrible. It's like a clumsy translation from some eastern European language, and sends you to sleep in 5 minutes."
5,Thank you for your exceptional service,"I recieved the item in less than a week after placing the order. In addition, the item was actually in better condition than the description indicated. I like this seller, If you are a smart online shopper, you will not think twice about making a purchase with him/her."
4,it's alright,If you want a really well done documentry about ECW's history buy the WWE's Rise and Fall of ECW...but if you're a fan who knows the history and want to know some inside stories from the guys who lived them buy this DVD.Forever Hardcore is pretty much all interview. I found the interviews very entertaining (New Jack cracks me up) but a lot of people I know thought the documentry started to drag midway through.There are five bonus matches included:Terry Funk vs. SabuShane Douglas vs. Chris CandidoNew Jack vs. Vic GrimesJerry Lynn vs. Chris Hamrickand Sandman vs. Konnan
1,Poor wrestling documentary,"This really drags on waaaaayyyyyy too much. It is all interview footage with very few photos and virtually no video to back up the narration of the interviewees. If you are a hardcore ECW fan, it may be interesting to hear some of the storied, but from a documentary standpoint, this is poor. It is very dry and does not capture the excitement of the ECW it claims to extol."
1,RIPOFF,Another guy trying to make a quick buck off Bob.Buy the Original done by the real BOB.We don't need yet another ELVIS....I mean BOB impersonator here. Send them to Vegas.
2,Why?,"Why not just get a Dylan album? I could understand maybe seeing them live, but why buy this when you can get the real thing?"
3,Review of Recorded Books on Tape version,"This is not a book that lends itself to a good audio recording. Listening to the ""text"" portions of the books was fine - very enjoyable and very informative - however, it is impossible to listen to the lists of published books without getting bored. I ended up fast forwarding through the book lists and probably missed some of the text as well.Yes, I recommend this book - but read it - don't listen to it."
4,Literary History,"Making The List does jut what its title suggests; it takes the best seller list since the early 1900 up until 1999 and analyzes them in order to make meaning out of the tendencies and the reocurrences.The analysis itself is only slightly above average as Korda mostly only states the obvious. The real reason to get this book is to be able to analyze each list by yourself. Some books on those lists I've never heard of, others are still very well present today (Rebecca, Old Man And The Sea...). And some of the tendencies are quite strange; during the 60s, the biggest best selling novel was in fact The Bible. And it's quite frightening to see how unorignal the lists for the 90s were; only the names like King, Clancy, Steele, Clark, Cussler and Grisham seem to appear on those lists.I really enjoyed going through this book. It's brief, straight to the point and very concise. A great piece of literary history!"
3,Interesting As Far As It Goes,"""Making The List"", is an interesting book that piques the reader's interest rather than satisfying it. This 10-chapter book contains 195 pages, and more than half, 100 pages, are just the lists of the best-selling books for a given year.Michael Korda provides informative, witty, and at times sharp edged commentary for the 10 decades of books that he comments upon. The analysis he offers is uneven, although it greatly improves once his observations originate during his tenure as a publisher. I have always wondered just how many books need to be sold to make the annual list. He does provide numbers occasionally, but they are the exception not the rule. Some of his remarks are readily apparent to readers who pay attention to the names of authors that routinely appear year after year. Being told that a short roster of names have virtually locked up the annual lists for almost 20 is not news."
2,"Its ok for the price, but don't be surprised with its quirks","It takes somewhat grainy pictures and it also seems to have some problems with its colors, but for its price it is ok. Although its quality is kind of low (you wouldn't take pics with this for printing out), it is alright as a general purpose digital cam, especially in situations where you would not want to take a more expensive camera. One big problem is that this camera eats up batteries like crazy. Unless you are using rechargeables it will end up costing a lot. It might end up actually being cheaper to just buy disposable cameras and develop the film to get higher quality pictures and scan them if you need them on the comp."
2,I didn't buy this product but was asked to rate it??,I do not know why this is showing as one of my unreviewed purchases since I did not buy this item.
4,Good camera for the price,"I bought this camera because it was an inexpensive way to try out digital photography. I prefer regular cameras because I don't have a great printer yet, but I just wanted to have this type of camera around in case I wanted to take pictures I want to see right away. It takes very nice pictures that print out great on my old printer. It was extremely easy to use and the pictures download very fast. The software was fun to use.Since I had my fun with it, and it's so easy to use,I am going to give it to my 5 year old son to introduce him to photography. He already took some great pictures and enjoys seeing the pictures pop up on the computer. He can take as many as he wants becuase I don't have to pay for film and processing."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA,"Other than buying this for a young child to experience the digital camera world, I would not recommend that anyboy purchase this camera. I purchased it thinking I could use it to put pictures on ebay, but oh, I was wrong. If there is any light in the room, the camera pictures have a white background. If you turn the flash off, you can't see. If you turn the flash on, it turns white again. I know its reasonably valued, but remember, you truly get what you pay for. Invest in something else unless you really are buying this for a child between the ages of 3-5."
2,Incompatible with WinXP,"The camera is lightweight and comes with the USB/serial port attachments, but unfortunately it's not compatible with WinXP. Going to the Polaroid website is no help. After emailing and searching the site, I found the appropriate drivers for XP.Taking pictures is a snap, the instructions are very easy to follow, the pictures are so-so, best to take pics during daylight. It's a good entry into digi-cam if you're not familiar with uploading pics to the computer."
4,A Masterpiece,This is a fine piece of men/s jewelry. It attracts many appreciations and it works very well.Otherwise is a little too bulky on my hand. I'm not a big man but still...I like it and I strongly believe it is a good buy.
1,Nelson 5210 timer mate watering switch,"I've searched everywhere for this product (locally and on line)and can't find it...The manufacturer stopped making them, so ordering them through Amazon has cost me a lot of time and frustration with nothing to show for it. This product would be great, but since you can't find them, all the glowing reviews in the world won't do you any good. I give it 1 star due to unavailability."
5,Make your manual water system almost automatic,"Using a couple of L.R. Nelson 5210 Auto Watering Area Switches in series in conjunction with an automatic timer has given me the ability to water my yard while I sleep, without investing lots of money in an underground sprinkling system."
5,R2 D2 BENEATH THE DOME MOIVE ITS OK! MARK,R2- D2 Beneath the Dome was very good. R2-D2 is so cool!!!! There is one partthat is funny. R2-D2 eats too much food! You need to get this dvd. It is so cool!!age 9Mark Thomann
2,Save your cash,"This book isn't really worth the paper its printed on. The code examples are very incomplete, and the book covers the subject matter very poorly in my opinion. I don't know how well Mastering Delphi 5 covers ADO, but Delphi 5 Developers Guide barely mentions it, which is why I purchased this book. The examples in this book are terrible, and it skips over a lot of information that I had to hunt down in newsgroups. All in all, I'm sorry I purchased it, and did better using newsgroups and mailing lists then with this book."
2,Good for learners who like to read from physical paper,"Very disappointed with this book. It's a basic book, not advanced. A high percentage of the text is ADO object definitions - I did not need to pay to read this, I can look at the source on disk. There are many electronic tutorials for ADO available that a competent and experienced developer would get the same benefit from. This is only a nice introduction for beginners (imho)."
1,Much Ado about nothing,I found essentially nothing new in this book that I had not already found in Delphi's DG. I can't think of anything that I took away from it. If this was advanced I better run and take my Mensa test!
2,Advanced?,"The book is barely OK, advanced it is defenitely not. If I had bought a binder, 500 sheets of paper and some ink I could have printed a better reference from: 1. Borland documentation and 2. Just about any website with the most basic ADO tutorial.Overall I'm not saying that you should avoid purchasing the book like it was the plague, but if you are anything above novice level on ADO you better look elsewhere."
1,Use it as a door stop,"Absolutely dreadful!! This is probably the worst computer book I've ever bought. The authors must have been ""on"" something when they wrote it, and I can confidently say it'll be getting pulped by the publishers soon.Gives nothing the regular Borland documentation doesn't already cover. The code examples do not fill me with confidence that the authors actually understand Delphi programming basics either.You are better buying Understanding ADO from Microsoft press - I had to after reading this drivel."
4,true crime murder,this movie is taken from a true crime case where a man who lost his wife & his teenage daughter took over the wife's chores in taking care of the children & the father. He desided her wanted her to take on all of his wives duties. she told a class mate what her father was doing to her & wish someone would kill her father so he desided to help her & he killed the father.very intense.
2,Scratches easily,"These plates look beautiful, but do not hold up. I returned the whole set after 1 week of use because forks left scratches on the plates."
4,Beautiful Dinnerware,"We love the Pinzon Tomato Collection. It is really beautiful. We were disappointed with the quality - mostly that the underside of the plates where they sit on the plate underneath isn't finished smoothly. We cut Easy Liner in circles to fit inside each plate, to solve this problem. But we think the quality should have been better for the price."
2,AquaJogger,I did not like his item at all. I have an above ground pool and do my summer walking in the pool. I bought these thinking they would give a little more strength training but I could not walk with them. They just caused me to fall into the water because they are too slick against the vinyl bottom of my pool.
4,Off to see the wizard,"Ojos de Brujo (Eyes of the Wizard) is one of the most creative bands in Spain at the moment. They blend stains of pure flamenco (guitarist Ramón Gimenez comes from a line of flamenco guitarists) with hip-hop, jazz, African, Indian, whatever... to make their own unique withches brew. The new album may not be as genre-bending as their second disc ""Bari"", which I discovered on a trip to Spain a few years back, but after virtually inventing a new style that would be difficult to do. Vocalist Marina Abad is a commanding presence. Check the band out live if you have a chance; they just rocked LA's California Plaza for a free Grand Performance concert. This disc has ample highlights, in particular ""Todo Tiende,"" ""Runalí,"" ""Feedback"" and ""Respira."" A must-have disc for fans of Spanish and Latin music."
5,Brilliant CD!!,"Brilliant CD!! Fantastic vocals, musicianship, songs and production mixing Flamenco (especially rhumba and bulerias) with influences of salsa, India, the Middle East, jazz, Drum 'n' Bass, reggae, hip-hop and rap (including beat-box)... all while retaining it's Flamenco core! At times, rhythmically complex, the CD is still funky as hell and will appeal to most listeners who enjoy the styles mentioned above."
5,Great Book.,"We used this with our first born, and we used it so much it became very worn. This is the second time buying this book! We are now using it for our youngest to help with speech therapy."
4,She drooled over it,"CON: The pages are somewhat hard to turn because they're 8th inch cardboards trimmed neatly at the edges. Luckily my 18 months daughter didn't frustration over it. If only each page was trimmed with a tab or a notch then it would have been easier for a kid and an adult to turn the pages.PRO: The pages themselves have a water-resistant finish to them so when my daughter drooled over it I wiped it off 15 minutes later and the book is still good condition without any damage. Food and juice got onto the pages and only a tiny spot got peeled off when two pages got ""glued"" together. She loves the book. There are hundreds of pictures to teach my daughter and ask her to point to. These include words for the body, transportation vehicles, fruits, flowers, colors, shapes, animals, and everything activities.Overall, the book met my expectations for what I paid for. (I saw it in a store first before I purchased it online.)"
4,JVC Arsenal CSAR650,"With a good radio like the ""Pioneer Z110BT Navigation system"" and ""external amplifier"", you would bring out the subtle details in your music. Cast aluminum frames use JVC's own heat transfer technology to keep things running cool even under extreme conditions. The perfectly aligned woofer and tweeter deliver sound from a single point source for unbelievable realism and distinct stereo imaging."
1,don't buy!!,"If your a fan of shocking and crazy videos of people getting shot, ran over, or people jumping to their death. Then don't buy this dvd it sucks plain and simple all it shows is the aftermath of people who died and it doesn't even tell you how the died all you see is people like cops and EMTs poking at a dead body. i know it is under four dollars but save your money for something else like BANNED FROM TELEVISON... NOW THAT IS A GOOD DVD."
5,we love cherub wings! weeeee loooove iiiiiit!,"All of the Cherub Wing videos are great! I wanted some videos that would inspire and teach my children as Christians. They loved this cute little angel who tells Bible stories and teaches about being better people! Enjoy!""Will you like this? YES! weeeee loooove iiiiiit!"" - Dominic, 7"
2,Good for very young kids,"play time: 22 min. The angel choir master and Cherub Wings retell the story of the first Christmas and the gift of the Savior to the world. Lots of songs (""Come and See Jesus,"" ""All Must Draw Near""), some familiar (a samba version of ""Friendly Beasts""). 3-D and 2-D animation, plus some live action. Cherub is precocious and conversational in a kid-friendly way, explains the story of Christmas easily and thoroughly (and biblically). Sometimes cheesy, but probably good for younger kids. The show culminates with the angels singing ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas."" Suggested age: 3-7 (I would have gone 3-6) Feels like a children's TV special you'd see very early on a Saturday morning on the Baby Einstein channel."
3,Generous at 3 stars,"I'd be kinder with the stars if the title were ""Learn Database Administration using SQL-DMO"". But I am already clear about that. The only reason I went with 3 was that some of the scripts are indeed useful. But what I was looking for was a good succint overview of SQL-DMO. Rather than focus on the SQL-DMO object model and how best to employ it, the book is a series of tasks DBA's might typically want to accomplish with example code. What I needed was answers to how do you know to use such and such method over some other alternative. Or even a discussion on the pros and cons of techniques employed woud have been more helpful."
2,Dead When it Rains!,"This may be a good system if you live in the desert. If, however, you live where it rains; it is essentially worthless. The signal goes out in the lightest of showers and when you get a thunderstorm, forget about it. You will be without television for the evening.DirecTV's claim that, ""DIRECTV delivers a digital signal 99.9% of the time, rain or shine."" is quite simply untrue. At the moment, my television signal is out - AGAIN. I am on-line using my cable. It is undisturbed by the rain. If you live where it rains, do yourself a favor and stay with cable. Much better service and no lease commitments"
5,great at-home reference for peds resident,"This is a keeper for any peds resident's personal library, and it should probably be the go-to book. Rudolph's is comparable to Nelson's in its scope, detail, and comprehensive subject matter in pediatrics. I think where Rudolph's tops Nelsons is in readability--the writing won't put you to sleep quite as easily, the charts & tables are very helpful, and the font is also much more reader-friendly. Nowadays, if you're a resident, you really should be current and be able to know what's beyond the textbooks (i.e., journal literature). However, Rudolph's is a great basic place to start when learning a topic in Peds."
1,Missing LinkTheater,"First time -- the drive door wouldn't open. Sent it back (to the fairly helpful on-line vendor...) and received a new one that worked (quite nicely) for 3 months. Then the drive stopped working, wouldn't read any disks but an audio CD and that kept clicking. Because it was past the 30 day return policy of the original vendor I had to return it to Buffalo (after spending interminable hours on the phone with tech support) at my own expense. They then sent me a new one, which I hooked up one day and used for 15 minutes. The next day it wouldn't even switch on at all -- something completely dysfunctional in the electronics. Three machines, none of which worked. I will be demanding my money back and will NEVER buy another Buffalo product again."
3,Works as advertised,I bought Linktheater last week. I have been reasonable happy with the device. i have connected it through my hard wired router. I have no problems playing MPEG and WMV files. I have not been able to play AVI files.The device has trouble playing WMA flies from a large library.I found I need to point the software to individual albums to access music files.My main goal for this unit is to play video files from my hard drives. I find the device work well when playing files through the connection with my PC. The unit does not recognize hard drive formated NTSF unless you play files through PC. Hard drives must be formated FAT32 to take advantage of the direct USB connection.Over all I am happy with the device but I can see room for improvement in future models.
2,LinkTheater doesnt link!,"Great idea...poor product. Works like a product thrown together by a couple genius college students. Awesome idea, but not really ready for prime time. Too many bugs and glitches. Basically it just wont play my music from my PC without locking up after about 10 minutes and requiring a restart."
3,Be Careful with iTunes,"A word of caution to all who think this will work with iTunes. It won't. Buffalo had no answer for me, and had no plans to resolve the problem. I'm running the PC Link Server Application on my computer with iTunes version 7. I've even tried running this application with other computers in my home, and it refuses to work with iTunes' protected AAC format. As far as pictures and videos go, it works great. Pictures appear in full screen, and crystal clear. If you want both the pictures and video with the ability to handle iTunes music, go with the AppleTV."
3,"Great idea, bad implementation","In all fairness, this is one of the best media players on the market in regard to compatability; however, the firmware, navigation, and remote functionality are far from user friendly or efficient. Navigating to media files on the network is painful...it takes far too many clicks of the remote to navigate through a poorly designed menu interface. It can take 20 minutes just to locate a media file.If you plan on using the unit as a standalone player, it will play about any disc you throw at it. If you want something that will stream divx, xvid, WMA etc over your network, hold out for the next product as this one will surely frustrate you to the point you can't use it. I had to return mine as it simply didn't perform adequately and modified my PC to perform the same function."
3,anger,"what are kids nowadays so angry about?perhaps mom and dads satelitte dish fell off the side of the house?you got to like the enthusiasm and energy of these guys. lots of fun. its really nice to hear a band that means it. really means it and believes in it.check out the percussion. that's Mr. Jeffy Scott along with his side kick Rudy. Jeffry always brings the A-game. one of the best punk rock drummers on this continent.I wouldnt be suprised if he goes through two or three snare drums a show. this guy is awesome!!!!!!best track is ""army of hope"""
2,Disappointing,"Too many of the essays are plot summaries. The font and spacing and design of the text pads the page count and looks amateurish; rather inexcusable given modern publishing tools.Two good essays by Disch and great long interview with Crowley re Aegypt. Worth ten bucks, not twenty."
1,Such High Hopes,"I found it impossible to identify with or appreciate the main character - she was snotty, selfish, and completely obnoxious. I am a new mother, and had hoped this book would help me get through the tough patches with a little bit of humor, but the writing style (overly simple) and the self-obsessed nature of the aspiring actress made it difficult to even finish the book."
1,"Read it if you like flighty, self absorbed characters","The title of this book is extremely misleading. Camille didn't even have a baby until halfway through the book.Camille is a self-absorbed bad actress who doesn't even know if she likes, let alone loves, her psychiatrist boyfriend. She's always somewhere else when they have sex (can't call it making love, she's not even there with him at all). She's floating in the wind. Get a grip, girl!She has a baby and is shocked at how much work they are. She still can't stand her boyfriend and can't really acknowledge his feelings about fatherhood or the changes in their already dull relationship.Then she gets this flirty idea to pursue Eric Hughes? Puh-leeze.The character and her boring problems did not draw me in. Sure, there was an occasional funny moment. I read it only because my husband bought it for me, thinking it was humorous non-fiction in the vein of Erma Bombeck. NOT!Borrow it from the library is all I can say if you must read it."
1,disappointing,"As a poet, poetry lover and children's librarian I found neither originality of thought nor beauty of language here although I do give Sahara Sunday Spain credit for taking the initiative to draw and write so prolifically. These ""poems"" seem to have come from a little girl who has listened to the sophisticated adults around her rather than from the heart of a child. They are chock full of ""new age"" cliches.Poems by a Little Girl by Hilda Conkling (op) is an example of exquisite and original poems that are truly reflections of a child's perspective."
1,Not worth it,"I'm sorry, but I just cannot bring myself to believe or enjoy this blatant attempt for Sahara Sunday Spain to get into Harvard. Not only is the poetry weak, but it's formulaic and not particularly insightful. Why anyone would want to read poems by a nine year old girl that aren't any good is beyond me. This girl is clearly one of those ""helping orphans in Mozambique"" community-serivce college-application driven little putzes with a good PR agent. Don't waste your money or buy advertising spiel, this book is strictly not worth it, unless you are someone who thinks that Yoko Ono is a talented singer and Al Gore invented the internet. It's fine if her family thinks she's talented, but they could keep it to the refrigerator. This book of Saharah's mother's poetry is passable on any shopping agenda.Thanx! :-)"
1,Profundity for idiots,"I recieved this book as a present, and was skeptical about poetry written by a 9 year old girl. Unfortunately, I had every write to be skeptical, as this is the stupidest book I have ever read. These are the kind of poems kids can churn out, which, in fact, one has. The only thing is that children's poetry shouldn't be published. Sahara Sunday Spain hasn't looked into her soul and given a profound statement one what it is to be human, she's just written down junk and doodled a little, and got it sold. If you want to read real poetry, buy a book of poems by Emily Dickinson, or Sylvia Plath, or someone with talent. Please, don't waste your money."
5,A Genuine Wealth Of Knowledge -- What A Find!!!,I really do like this book. The clarity of thought demonstrated in this book to explain and convert a reader to drive to Customer Success is compelling. I now understand the vast differences between customer service and customer success. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to read it. I have a definite advantage over my competitors and I plan to have all of our office heads read this book and teach it to our staff!
2,Display only.,"I recieved this set for Christmas 2012. The pieces are amazing and wonderful. The detail is over the top. It brings new excitement to the game. However, I've only played a few games and as I return for the next game I find parts broken off and chips. Mind you, it has not been in the hands of any child and so far both bishops and both queens are distroyed. The durribility of this product is good for display only. A real pitty. Not worth the price, I wish it came with a warranty."
4,Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare,"My copy has been a family treasure, thus read aloud over and over. This is an excelent book to read aloud with families and children. The many small illustrations aid the interest of the young reader and listener. E. Nesbit creates an excellent transition between today's spoken English and the language you will hear in Shakespeare's plays."
1,See for Yourself...,"This book is good for historical value and amusement, but if seeing a Timon of Athens who looks like he waltzed out of a fairy story is bothersome to you, don't buy it. E. Nesbit is firmly of the ""Shakespeare is the greatest moralist since Jesus Christ"" school, and the plots have been tailored to fit this characterization. The tales have so little to do with actual Shakespeare that your own memorial reconstructions would be more accurate and entertaining. But you can check it out for yourself at <http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/lit/Shakespeare/BeautifulStoriesfromShakespeare/toc.html>."
1,Cheap product.,This product is made of very brittle plastic and is poorly designed. The hinges broke the first time I opened it. Don't waste your money on it.
4,LOVE it!,"I'm on my second one of these, and searched high and low to find it! My first lasted for years. This is the best size for daily compostable kitchen scraps. A larger capacity would take longer to fill - and smell rather ripe before filling. I line ours with a paper towel and empty daily. An occasional bleach solution removes stains. ~ One VERY satisfied customer! ~"
3,"Sorta dissapointing, but","Kinda dissapointing, but hey, for the price?Wish it had a handle.Just the right size for our small household.Even Germphobic Hubby likes it. Which is really saying something."
4,Enlightening!,"The great thing about the exercise system described in this book is that there are no hard or fast rules to follow. You set the pace you want to work at, pick the music you want to listen to, decide where and when you want to work out. If you feel like jogging, you cary the hand weights and instantly improve the quality of your daily run. If dancing is more your speed, adding the arm movements increases the intensity, and, I feel, the enjoyment of the session. If you have been intirgued by the new ""cardio-boxing"" craze or Tae-Bo, you might want to try the boxing workouts in Heavyhands first. It may give you all the sparring and punching you could ever ask for. In short, this is a workout you won't grow tired of because you can always alter it or add a new element. You are limited only by your imagination!"
4,Brush your teeth after listening!,"This CD is almost identical to an old vinyl collection called ""The Best of Buddha"" (Buddha being the label that originally released these songs) that I owned when I was just a little guy. The last track wasn't on it, but it had a rather eerie song by Melanie (who also sang ""Brand New Key"") called ""Momma Momma"" where she kind of shrieked and wailed and basically scared me. So I always skipped that track. But in any case, this is definitely one that is recommended only for nostalgia purposes, unless you have a strong appetite for kitsch. But it does a pretty super service to those of us who have these songs embedded in the folds of our brain and want to reawaken some long forgotten childhood memories!"
5,This bubblegum pops!!!,"Just before I discovered the Beatles, this was my musical world (this and the Monkees and Herman's Hermits in my house). I was 4 years old in 1969, but I already knew how to operate a record player, and I borrowed my older sisters' records. Included were ""Yummy,Yummy,Yummy"" and other Ohio Express and 1910 Fruitgum Co. 45s. This cd brings me back to that time, and includes a few songs I missed back then."
4,3 Great movies!,I couldn't beat the price I paid for these 3 movies. And the picture quality is like any other bluray from the store.
4,Cheap Deal for some great movies,"I love watchmen and V for Vendetta. I havnt seen Constantine yet, but the video quality of these movies is amazing. Great buy for only 13$"
3,jipped,thought i was going to get all 3 of these movies but i only got v for vendetta which was basically what i was looking for. still a let down when i opened the package
5,Great Deal!,What a wonderful way to add (upgrade) three great movies to bluray. The price was beyond reasonable and am happy i've added all three to my growing collection of blurays. Extremely happy!
2,Disappointed,"The Year and Month windows are manually updated, not operated by the watch mechanism. The description does not note this.Also the 24 hour dial is not separately settable to a different time zone. This is not clear from the description and IMO makes the feature pointless.DOM and DOW settings are initially set via edge plungers on the watch but on mine the DOW plunger is not working so I set the watch to the correct DOW via the time setting stem and use the plunger to set/update the DOM as necessary.The watch uses a wrist watch size automatic wind mechanical watch mechanism, apparently from China, and while it appears to be well made and has a very solid stainless steel case I question the validity of the claimed MSRP of over $1000."
3,OK for newbies to Bibical studies,"This is a documentary given in a traveloge type of view, by two evangelists. They travel through the various locations looking for indications of evidence for the Ark's final location.a bit goofy in some parts, but the whole comes out well."
2,Otherwise nice picture quality suffers from Blooming Distortion,"This tv would be nice except for blooming: when bright bodies of solid color(whites, yellows) appear on screen, they bulge out, distorting the picture. So sometimes, when the colors are subdued, the picture looks pretty good, but when something bright appears on screen the picture is messed up. This can sometimes seriously screw up what you're looking at. I say look somewhere else."
2,"OK picture, terrible sound","I had to return this tv because the sound was so bad. There is a constant buzzing (probably due to 60Hz hum) coming thru the speakers at all times. It's really noticable thru the headphone jack which makes headphone listening useless. The display in the store had the same problem, too (I checked with headphones). This is not the same sound as the high-pitched whine that the tv makes from the transformer! That is annoying, too.The picture was fine but could not get the color correct even after adjusting every picture setting. This is unfortunate because it has a nice remote and great features for the price. Not recommended unless you are using in a noisy environment and without headphones."
1,Buyer Beware,"I had this TV less than a year and the sound went dead. Since the TV was still under warranty, Phillips told me to ship the TV back to them and they will send a new one. The ""new"" television was refurbished and didn't work. Bad products and horrible customer service."
4,Energetic Tjader Album,"Mambo is Cuban, NOT Mexican music. It was the most popular Cuban rhythm (cha cha cha is a type of mambo), and salsa was the result of the experimentation in the US of Latin jazz and Latin fusion. Cal Tjader was one of the most influential practitioners of Latin jazz, and although he himself was not Latin, his music sounds just as authentic as that of Tito Puente and Ray Barretto. Although some of the covers on this album sound like, well, covers; other tracks, like Guachi Guara (later titled Soul Sauce), Tjader's composition Mambo Macumba, and Fascinating Rhythm, have a fresh, authentic sound that will get you dancing. This is much more than just a cover album, and suitable for true Latin fusion fans."
1,Tepid. Lots of dragging scenes. Incredibly Boring!,This story is set some time during the Roman rule of Nero. I really feel that I was cheated of my money's worth with this one! There wasn't much 'action' and the story itself lacked witty repartee and touching scenes. It was only in the end that Gaelle and Cerdic outwardly showed their unity. Both characters also mistake respect and compassion for love. Yuck!
5,An outstanding gardening book,"Ed Hume's book is perfectly indexed, amazingly organized and an outstanding reference for selecting, planting and maintaining a yard. His down to earth language is easy to understand and mixed with humor. The perfect gardening book."
4,gardening by ed hume...nw gardening made easy,received quickly and in perfect condition...the book itself was informative but more photos of plants would be helpful to novice gardeners like myself.
5,"Fantastic, spirited baroque music",This is another great release from Chatham Baroque -- I'm never disappointed by their exciting and fun playing of interesting repertoire.
4,Good stuff,My second bottle of CLA. This product is good and well packaged. What more can you say about a supplement... I'd order again
3,CLA,"I received excellent service and delivery was very fast. I have only been taking the product for 3 weeks. I have been told it can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months to notice a difference. I am going to continue to take it for the full bottle (3 months) supply. I notice small differences in my appetite not being as insatiable, I also have been having heartburn more frequently. Although I don't know if that can be attributed to the CLA."
4,Why Don't More People Listen to Spike?,"I read about Spike Robinson before I ever hard him play. Gene Lees did an essay on him a while back. Since then, sad to say, Spike has passsd on; but I'm glad he left us some recordings.He was an amateur player for most of his life--an engineer by profession, just sitting in on club dates. But, according to Lees, he was always a remarkable player.When he retired he went musical pro and did a small number of records before he died at a decently old age.Spike's work belongs to the Lester Young, Stan Getz, Zoot Sims school of sweet but swinging tenor playing. So if you if your taste in tenors runs to Coltrane and Stitt, you won't find Spike very exciting.But if you like Harry Allen, Scott Hamilton, and other such like romantic players, you'll love Spike. I do."
5,easy to use,These water color pencils are versatile. They can be used like regular color pencils or washed with a wet brush for a water color effect. Combine the large areas of regular water colors and add detail with the pencils. They are so much better than the water color pencils offered years ago.
3,somewhat disappointed,"When a fellow art student showed me watercolor pencils, a product I didn't know existed, I was SO excited. These don't seem to leave as much pigment as theirs did, so the color isn't as rich, or go as far when using water. I am a very beginner so operator error could explain a lot. Another disappointment was the delivery time. Amazon is usually amazingly prompt, and I was anxious to get them. The site assured me that I could choose a shipping option that would arrive in 2 days. At check out that option was missing, and it took 5 days to arrive. That's like a year in Amazon Prime time."
3,Crappy tire,"The bike got a damaged tube, which was unbelievably frustrating for a brand new product."
1,Odd Book,A retro diagram-only chunky little book appropriate for someone who is not familiar with common sense American culture or general life skills. I regret not reading the reviews before I purchased.
1,Does NOT teach you everything you need to know,"I still don't know what year France occupied Austria. This book is GARBAGE! I paid 20 dollars to learn what year France occupied Austria and you know what I got? Tips on how to redecorate my stove.Like a stove needs redecorating anyway...What next, an autobiography by Bill Clinton?!"
2,Outdated,"Modern textbooks for younger readers can go overboard on flashy pictures andgraphics. This text certainly does not do that. It's visually flat and uninteresting.The primary points in a lesson are not graphically highlighted; making them hard tofind. The most common use of graphics is to intersperse cartoons to lighten thesubject. Frankly, it's hard for me to understand what the other reviewers see in thistext that is worth recommending."
4,Algebra,This is an excellent book to use for tutoring middle school students learning beginning algebra. The book is well written and is easy for the student to read on their own. There are large numbers of problems for each topic and if they are solved they provide a great opportunity to insure that the material has been properly understood by the reader. It would have been better if solutions for all the problems were provided for those students trying to learn the material on their own.
5,Elementary Algebra--Jacobs,This is an excellent book! It could easily be used for a two-year algebra course. My daughter (seventh grade) is enjoying the cartoons and mind puzzles. The answers to section two for each lesson are in the back of the book.
3,Good intentions,"I foolishly bought this book with the usual high hopes that I could somehow glean some understanding of the complexities of Algebra. Not so. It is slightly, only slightly more understandable than other Algebra textbooks, but still requires someone with a good basic understanding of numbers and how they work. I simply am not at all a math person. Never will be. I would not recommend this book for those who struggle, as in struggle with everything in them. The very best book giving basic introductory Algebra concepts is Mathematics Connections, Integrated and Applied, by Glencoe McGraw-Hill, ISBN 0-02-834978-4. God bless whomever wrote that life-saver."
4,Great book.,My daughter loves and enjoys the book. She has problems in math and this book has helped alot. I recommend it.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book after reading great reviews and hearing wonderful things about the Jacobs books in general. I have been working through the problem sets so I can be prepared to help my daughter if she gets stuck and I am very disappointed. The verbal descriptions and examples are helpful but the lessons are not long and detailed enough to provide adequate explanation. I have had to continually refer to other sources to help me. Some of the problems are quite easy but some are extremely confusing. My son is in a college calculus course and had a hard time following the reasoning in this book. It may be a good text for someone with a ""mathematical mind"" but it has proved fairly useless to me."
5,Always a New Yorker,"No matter where I live, I'll always and all ways be a New Yorker. I lived in the Bronx on a street with about 30 kids. These are the games we played until the summer light failed or our mothers called us in from the street. I bought 5 copies of this wonderful piece of nostalgia to give to my siblings. The price was right and amazon has proven again that it offers what I want to own."
3,Relive the past!,A great walk down memory lane. The games I played in the streets of New York came alive on this video.
2,Hippies only,"If you like music that sounds like it's from the 60s just for the sake that it sounds like the 60s, in a wandering-around-Berkeley-feeling-groovy kind of way, then maybe you'll be into this band. The guitars jangle a little like the Byrds, and the harmonies pile up like the Airplane, but there's nothing here you haven't heard before somewhere else, and probably done better there too."
3,Great service,It came as advertised. It came rapidly. The only complaint I have is that I ordered a hardcover and received a paperback.
2,Do not pay more than $1 for this,"It is a bit shocking to see someone other than Buster Crabbe play Flash Gordon, although Steve Holland holds his own as a steely-eyed space ranger. I'm not sure how to classify this DVD. It would be a good stocking-stuffer, last minute gift for a sci-fi geek or film aficionado, a nostalgia piece, a reward for obedient children, or an historical curiosity.However you classify it, you need to take these episodes with a grain of salt. They are low-budget scripts, low budget sets, and low budget acting. So anyone under 8 years old will be impressed.What these episodes do well is to spark the imagination and sense of wonder. Space is a reality that we, and our descendants for many generations, will have to deal with. Films like this get us thinking in the right direction."
4,One song,I admit I liked this song but everything after this one blew.I heard they are back with another sucky album.
2,Cemetary,it doesn`t seem like anyone that posted their review noticed that 'cemetary' isn`t an unreleased demo.. it`s a cover a Silverchair song...
2,waste of money,"... she's one of the girls screaming ""I LOVE BENJI AND JOEL!!!!!""about the cd:there's lifestyles... i'm not a big fan of that song. i'm a huge fan of gc, but they wrote it to get famous... i know where they're comin from but i think it's a major act of hypocricy to complain about the famous when you made that song to GET famous.cemetary: i wasn't too impressed with this song.the click: this is one of my favorite songs on the first cd. i think it was a waste to put that song on the single when it's the LIFESTYLES single. dur.the video for lifestyles: like you haven't seen it... it's clever, but mtv plays it too much so all you have to do is push the record button and you can watch it as much as you want. no big deal. plus you don't have to pay 10$ for it.conclusion: if you want it for lifestyles: just get the young and the hopeless, it's a much better cd, and it's worth the money..."

1,Chinese staples inferior,I'm in the middle of laying hardwood and bought a new box of staples which were made in China. Immmediately had misfires and twisted staples. I had a number of left over partial staple racks from ones I bought two years ago that were USA made and put them in the gun and they worked fine. Went back to store and exchanged box but the chinese staples have over fifty per cent mangled misfires.
2,You get what you pay for,It is a costume but the minute my son removed it from the package the shirt ripped company could care less. Will not issue a return would never do business with them and Amazon was of no help. If you could cut w/scissors make your own. cheap cheap cheap
3,Slik Pro 500DX just an average Tripod,"This is a very well made and sturdy Tripod that should make a great companion for many years. Extending the legs vertically on this Tripod is very easily done and once the legs are set you can forget about them. However, when it comes to extending the legs horizontally, this tripod only gives you three positions do do so. Most would say that the three positions are enough, but I purchased a not-so-famous brand tripod a few years ago for half the price, that lets you extend the legs horizontally in an infinite number of positions. Nevertheless, this Tripod would make a great companion to one of the Slik Ball-Heads which are some of the better heads on the market. Another beef I have about this tripod is that it did not come with a carrying case. You can purchase a carrying case from Slik as an accesory. On a scale of 1-100 I would rate this Tripod at 75-79."
5,Hilarious spoof of the teen horror genre.,"Jendra MacKenzie is a pretty ordinary, unpopular seventh-grader who is, to her dismay, flunking algebra. One day in the girls' bathroom at school, a shoe drops from the ceiling. That's the start of a totally weird series of events. Because the shoe has a piece of pompon on it, she shows it to the cheerleaders, who discover it is the principal's shoe (turns out someone stole the principal's socks, shoes, and pants that morning). Tina, the most popular girl in school and leader of the cheerleaders' clique, asks (well, ask is a loose word - more like FORCES) Jendra to become the mascot for the cheerleaders. After a super-weird initiation ritual in which she discovers the cheerleaders worship a ""sacred"" pompon, she's had enough. But the cheerleaders won't let her leave. Is she truly doomed? This was a hilarious spoof of school cliques, cheerleaders, and the teen horror genre."
4,"Pretty good, even though it was in japanese.","This movie was a great movie! I loved the game series so I figured I'd buy this movie. I must say I WAS disappointed to find that almost NOTHING from the game was in it, but the interesting storyline kept me watching. Yes, it is in Japanese BUT, there are subtitles. I recommend this to all parasite eve and movie fans!"
3,I would like to have given this movie one more star...,"BUT THE ENDING OF THIS MOVIE HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST COMPLETELY, UNREALISTICALLY SAPPIEST ENDINGS I'VE EVER SEEN!But I still don't want to give it away, as I was entertained throughout the first 3/4 or 3/5 of the movie. But, be warned: There's a lot of drama and SAPPINESS before and after you get to the part where Parasite Eve is causing havoc."
1,a forewarning,"It is subtitled, so if you are one of those people who like to read the movie, you will enjoy. However, for people who like to watch the movie, like myself, i would not have gotten it had I known........."
5,Great fan. I have been looking for years.,"I have been looking for years to find a replacement for the noisy cobbled exhaust fan the builder put in my attic to vent 3 bathrooms and the laundry room. Amazon is the last place I would consider to look for something like this. I only found it while I was looking for something else. I'd rather be lucky than smart.This unit is quiet and easy to install. Their installation methods and hardware are very flexible. The 240 CFM size is adequate to exhaust four room outlets of 4"" diameter each with major restrictors at the room outlets. I have the fan on a timer that runs 16 hours a day. The inlet of the fan unit is only a single 6"" opening. You must construct your own inlet plenum for multiple inlet connections. A Y-connector or a T-connector works nicely."
1,Not at all elegant,"I ordered 8 of these dinner plates because they came up as a substitute for the 8 Hotel Collection Classic White dinner plates I had ordered previously, but were no longer available. There were 2 reviews which raved about these Pinzon plates (clean classic lines, look great with her bone china set). The Pinzon plates are definitely not going to blend with bone china. TheyPinzon 11-Inch White Dinner Plates, Set of 4lack any elegance. They are thick and chunky. They remind me more of diner dinnerware that Hotel Classic dinnerware. I will be returning them."
4,Sobrevive...Sobrevive mis gustos,"I've always liked Kudai. Their first CD was more soft sounds, while their new CD reminds me somewhat of Evanescence. The songs are good, and the girls are pretty. What more could you need out of a group? I would definatly recomend this CD."
4,Easy to use,"I was a little worried that this is made in China. The product is slightly cheap looking. I used it on my offset smoker/grill conversion on king cooker burner. It was very easy and no leaks. Nice product. Even with the low pressure 10 psi, the high setting is still pretty powerful. I set my on the lowest setting for my offset smoker."
2,Not good result for me,I have used this cream every they (whole jarr) andi haven't seen any result. I think it's expensivebased on it's quality.
2,just a cream,"its just a cream. I do not look any younger, my wrinkles are still here .Skin texture is the same. Not worth the money. Nivea works just as well as far as i can see and is cheaper . Every so often I get conned by these creams and try them, but as of yet, I haven't found a ""miracle"" cream that actually lives up to the hopes it raises."
2,Chafa,No me gusto mucho. Es un poco aburrido. Hay unos 2 o 3 canciones buenas y no vale la pena poner el disco solo para escuchar 3. No la uso.
4,Blessed,"The cd arrived in a timely manner & was in great condition.Our church celebrated Holy Cross Day & other Mexican holidays that were in May with Mexican food,music & a speaker & guests from Mexico. They were very surprised & impressed to hear the cd playing & they started singing along with it."
1,Can't believe I paid $19.99,"This is hardly worth the $20 I spent on it. So much more could have been said/taught. I had hoped to use it as a compliment to the OT course I teach at a University. So much of it feels like the creators included the reading of long passages of Scripture to fill time. They could have included much more historical background information. I won't be using it, and I'll be listing my copy for sale. If it was under $10, I wouldn't feel so ripped off."
5,slappy,hi this book slappy is back!With his twin. he has to do three good deeds. can he do it?read it to find out. It is a good book.
5,Better than the rest!,No Goosebumps book can compare to this one. It's a lot better than the others because it's aimed mostly on Slappy rather than the victim for a change. I couldn't put it down.
1,Night of the Living Dummy V proves to be a disappointment,"Fans of Slappy tales prior to this one will be disappointed. The entire story actually takes place from Slappy's point of view, and the situations seem familiar but backward. There is no horror or excitement in this disappointing and bland story. Slappy actually has to perform three good deeds, causing him to lose his evil edge and notorious appeal. The book is a disgrace and a nightmare in itself."
5,book,great gift!!!! my son was so excited to receive this one he loves to read and finds that goosebump book to be interesting
3,Slappy's nightmare review,"I feel that in terms of the goosebumps books that involve slappy the dummy, this is my least favorite. It just seemes that it went in a completely opposite direction as the other books and the plot line just didn't end up working out. On the positive side however, there were parts that surprised me and parts that I found to be well written."
3,"OK, BUT NOT SCARY ENOUGH","Slappy is back and this time he has to do three good deeds or else Jimmy O' James will put him to sleep forever and ues the other copy of Slappy as his new dummy. R.L. Stine has his way of creating suspensful twists and turns but there is something missing in each Goosebumps book: It needs to make you get real GOOSEBUMPS! Sorry to say this, but Goosebumps just insn't all that great anymore."
1,Amazon has let me down several times,"I am tired of getting ""ITEM NOT AVAILABLE"". from Amazon.It is a waste of my time."
5,Railfan loves BigBoy,"The shirts are a bit big, so a XS (2-4) fits my 5 year old.Initially got the S and had to return.Company was good about the return.We really like the shirt."
5,The Benchmark for all exegetical commentaries on Romans,"William R. Newell, the Spirit-blessed author of the precious hymn ""At Calvary"" containing more doctrine in it's 4 verses than most sermons in today's pulpits, brings a sound, Dispensational verse-by-verse study of Paul's Epistle to the Romans. Truly a must-read and study for any serious Bible student, teacher or preacher."
4,Green Mansions - A Life Long Love,"The first time I ever saw this movie, I was in my teens. I fell in love with, the story, the haunting music, and the characters. Years later, I came across a 1944 edition of the book, Green Mansions, and fell in love all over again. Since then I've read and reread the book and watched and rewatched the movie. I now have to replace the movie, since I've worn it out. I may not be a movie critic and I don't always agree with their assessment of certain movies. But, I do know what I love. This story has a certain magic to it that is hard to find in movies today. A simply beautiful love story."
1,"I love Audrey, but this movie was terrible!","I bought this movie because I am Audrey's #1 fan, I collect her films and etc. I watched it once, and plan never to watch it again. The script is horrible, the acting is cheesy, and even though Audrey was an enchanting woman, even she couldn't do much to make up for this poor film. It was so ridiculous it made me laugh. And Audrey's hair (which I'm sure was a wig) looked funny. Was her husband (Mel Ferrer,the director) trying to destroy her career?"
2,Not Audrey's Best,"This movie could not be pulled off even with Audrey Hepburn. I am an ardent Audrey Hepburn fan but, the script was terrible and so was some of the acting. I hate to say it but this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I have not read the book but, from what I have heard the movie does not do the book justice. By the end of the movie I was actually glad it was over unlike many of Hepburn's other movies. I only gave it 2 stars because it is a Audrey Hepburn film."
2,Audrey's oddest film,"Being an Audrey fan, I tried to watch this movie despite others' bad reviews about the film. Well, they were right. This is probably one of the strangest film that I've ever seen. Due to my impatience, I just fast-forwarded to the scenes where Audrey's in it. Her stunning beauty is not enough to save this movie though. And, was Anthony Perkins supposed to look that clean-shaven even if he's in the forest? Oh well. 2 stars for Audrey and the doe Ip."
5,"Meditation ,supplication a spiritual practice.","""Wonderful book for those who wanted to learn more about supplication.Create intimate relation with God through meditation,contemplation and invocation that arises from deapth of soul.Goes beyond rituals prayers of islam to spiritual awareness of prayers. Ghazali has explained prophetic supplications ,concepts ,meanings very well to inspire one to supplicate."" Sincere prayers bring spiritual solution to our daily problems."
3,Bought for my overweight pug,When I first bought this for Sweetie she did not like it at all but she sleeps in my bed and I put it at on my bed at the foot and now she loves it. She rests her head on the sides. I was a little disappointed that it did not have more padding.
3,Soft Gel Hand Sanitizer - Lavender,"The lavender gel hand sanitizer is great because it doesn't dry out your skin - i prefer the lemon scented one over the lavender but it still smells nice. I feel my hands are getting germs killed without ripping off a layer of my skin. I keep bottles in my car, at my house, and in my pockets. I can't leave the house without any! It is all natural so it won't harm me, plus it's not greasy and you only need to put a little bit on so you get more for your money."
3,"EO Hand Sanitizer, 2 oz.","Smells more like Juniper than Lavender. I was buying this as a gift to one of my friends' daughters, but I don't think it would be a good thing for her to be reeking of Gin..."
3,"Equity in Roman Law, W.W. Buckland","Anything by Professor Buckland is of interest.The volume under review is short, consisting of three lectures delivered at University College, London, and some further material. He managed to cover considerable ground with a succint style that is appreciated by a lawyer or student.For a student who might require more broad-based information, I would recommend Professor Buckland's A Manual of Private Law instead"
3,Excellent until the last pages...,"This is one of the most hilarious books that I've ever read, but the end is absolutely ridiculous, totally non sense..."
1,Hard to finish.,This book was disappointing. The ending was nonsensical. If you are a fan of gratuitous sex scenes...this one is for you. This book was all over the place. Where was the editor?
2,Shouldn't a tv last more than a few years?,"I bought this tv a couple of years ago and now it turns red and shuts off every couple of minutes, sometimes after a few seconds. Granted I paid about $150 for the tv and it did work well in the beginning, shouldn't it still work after a couple of years.After reading about other people online who have other Phillips brand tv's and are suffering from the same problems that I am, I would say ""STAY AWAY""!!"
2,Wish it worked,"I purchased this item as a gift for a young girl who loves music. When she opened it she was thrilled she had her own ""iPod"". Even after putting in the batteries, double-checking them, flipping the switches on and off, testing the headphones on a different item, and consulting the instructions, we could not get this to work. On the plus side, the headphones seemed to work pretty well when plugged into an mp3 player, and the company refunded my money promptly."
4,An absolute window into new thought and healing.,The book is easy to follow and interpret even if you are new to this type of thinking. After reading the book I was so motivated to find a way to heal my own spirit while facing cancer treatment that I decided to attend the one week program called Return to Wholeness at the Chopra Center for Well Being in LaJolla CA. I highly recomend the book and program outlined in the book to anyone who is facing the challanges of cancer treatment.
4,Finally have it!,"After seraching for this cd, I have it. It displays all of the best latinos who thrill us with salsa. With Huey (DLG), Son by Four, Victor Manuelle, and others, this cd has a great collection and mix of our favorites. I like it so far, some of my favs include Son by FOur and Huey's song, b/c I have heard them before some place, but I guess it is nice to have a little sample of others. I don't know why Eddie Santiago decided to make this cd, or why he is not featured as much as i expected him to be on the cd. Listen to the sample and give it a try. A fun piece to add to your salsa collection!"
4,Good Classic,I had long awaited to find this horror film as I saw it as a kid. Although the movie is in black & white it still has some punch even after all these years. Its not your standard Hollywood blockbuster as it is a Mexican production set in Mexico. The cover does not give any indication of what the movie is about only a small scene which I think does not give the movie justice. In my opinion a good classic horror movie that is slightly better than a 'B' grade.
2,FOR PITT/MIRANDA FANATICS ONLY,"The image and sound quality are terrible. The images are grey and murky. The sound is full of hiss. I was confused when I read the review by phasedin he states ""it's still better than my early 90's video copy from one of those companies who specialize in public-domain titles."" This is an Alpha/Gotham release and thier forte is public domain. When I zoomed out, I saw video tracking on the image. I did some searches and for some reason you can only get this from Alpha Video. The plot and acting are better than O.K.The price is right, but this is by no means a feast for the eyes."
3,Scary as hell!,"This is an underated movie...mostly because the cinematography is poor..But it is a very scary premise; what's scarier than a man eating dinosaur come back to life? An INVISIBLE man eating dinosaur...(well it doesn't really eat them, but it may as well have!)The scream this thing makes will make a chill go down your spine....if that doesn't, the deceptively happy sounding bells that chime when the monster is coming....or the shuffling sound of it's footsteps as it approaches....will.One important note; you will need an imagination for it!"
5,Wonderful,"I have been involved in a great amount of self healing / meditation / focused exercise etc., for a long time.The particular exercises and methods recommended in this book have helped me tremendously.It is very practical and can be used by anyone.Highly recommended.Thank you for your extensive research, Dr. Demartini."
5,Awesome and a must read. . .,This book is truly an amazing piece of work.

2,nothing new.. want more money to get questions answers,I found nothing new in the book... when i emailed for clairification was sent back info from courses i was told i would need to understand my question... of course the workshop cost much much more than all the books combined.. and there are courses after that one... much like scientology.... much of what wasin book i ran across 40 years ago...
1,"Fun Concept, Flat Characters, Flat Plot","The concept has the potential for a lot of fun, drama, etc. Name your hook. Instead, you get characters which turn out to be faceless and featureless manequins who are thrust through time at points which are key to the story. There is very little drawn out of any of the characters which would cause a reader to empathize with them or care about what happens to them in the end.Without giving it away, the ""plot"" is so fragmented by the end one just wants to see the end and move on. The plot of both the title and the novel fail to impress. Finally, the cop-out twist at the end is a crutch that has made an appearance in many works of fiction, and rarely adds to the story."
5,A real page turner,Paul Levinson expands the imagination in his page turning science fiction novel. The well developed characters felt so real one could believe they actually existed! I couldn't put it down. Well done!
3,almost,"I have read previous Paul Levinson novels and found them very interesting. This is my least favorite. It may be the time travel theme. There are so many time travel novels that we are used to the time travel paradoxes. Levinson does not have a really creative addition to the time travel novel, except perhaps the confusion of time travel which he handles by bouncing the story through a variety of times. Yet this device gets tiring. He moves characters around just to do so.Socrates is an interesting choice, because he was'nt a scientist only a gadfly. There is a question of the real importance of Socrates."
3,Intriguing But Ultimately Unsatisfying,"This book could have been really fantastic. Time travel, ancient Greeks & Romans, Alexandria, I mean, it was all there. Intellectually, the book is actually pretty good. Intelligent, philosophical. A couple of nice plot twists. However. Levinson's writing is so spare you feel like you're reading some kind of graphic novel -- without the pictures. He includes almost no descriptions. His characters are extremely wooden. His sole female character (who every male character is in love with - give me a BREAK) is so poorly written you just have to laugh. To keep from crying. Ultimately, it failed to satisfy -- extremely disappointing as it had so much potential. Perhaps Levinson should co-author with someone who can flesh out his intriguing plot."
4,Review of Levinson's 'Plot to Save Socrates',"Classics and science fictions aren't generally bedfellows. However, Levinson takes this unique union to place a variety of classical characters is a new light. The 'Plot' is a fun, fast re-imagination of the trial of Socrates, Hellenistic Alexandria, and Victorian English. The author also offers a vision of the future. The story is fun, yet also thoughtful. Many of the most important conflicts in the story reflect classical research."
3,"A good ""symphonic goth"" album","I had never heard Sirenia before, until recently when I a song of from their newest (at the time) album. Enjoying this song very much, I went to find all the album they had out and, after listening to some samples, I bough ""An Elixir for Existence"" (not their newest). I was surprised when I heard the album that it was different then I expected (of course, clips of songs from the internet never tells you the whole story) - lots of growls and not as much female vocals as I had heard in the song from their newest album. I'm not a big fan of the growls heard in much of symphonic metal, but I think they are well-placed and accompany the music well. I classify this album as more ""symphonic goth metal"", a ""heavier"" version of Theater of Tragedy's ""Aegis"" (I am more into bands like Nightwish and Midnattsol). Having said that, I think this is a great album, if you're into goth and great to listen to if you're in a ""dark"" mood."
1,"Do not purchase these, they are garbage",I bought a set at Autozone. The custom center section cracked off and I had to buy a remover kit to remove them. Waste of money.
3,samsung battery,wrong size but i will take the blame for that. wrong size but i will take the blame for that. wrong size but i will take the blame for that. wrong size but i will take the blame for that. wrong size but i will take the blame for that.
5,Perfect! Excatly what I expected...,Fun to play like the old days. Fun game! Item as described. I had lost my old version. This was just what i was looking for.
3,Limited coverage of regions this year,"I always love these calendars but I've gotta take a few stars off from this year's France calendar. These is definitely a lack of coverage from AROUND the country. Regions covered are in only the Northwest, Southeast, or Central-east areas of the country. To me, this is like creating a US calendar without including at least one destination from the Southwest, or the Northeast. Please include wider coverage next year.Regions covered:January - Cote d'AzurFebruary - Alpes de Haute-ProvenceMarch - ParisApril - DromeMay - FinistereJune - VaucluseJuly - Cotes d'ArmorAugust - SavoieSeptember - BurgundyOctober - Ile de ReNovember - Ile de FranceDecember - Ille-et-Vilaine"
4,Intresting...,Satan Is No Mythby Oswald J. Sanders is very heavy in modern and traditional theology. Its what you would call a good mixture.The author displays his thoughts and opinions while not over shadowing the hard facts with his own thinkings.A good read. Enjoyable.
3,Too Bad The Ending Gets Sucked Down The Black Hole,"I picked up this novelization to find out what in the world happened at the end of the movie. In almost all cases the book is better than the movie, but not this time. If you want a coherent ending, this book disappoints. The last page (213) of my 1979 Del Rey / Ballantine edition has hanging sentences and paragraphs that have no beginning. Seems like someone else didn't know how to end this book either, so they choose not to.I had to press forward through the first fifty pages but the middle and most of the ending is a great read - burn the last three pages.This is not a kiddie book. A good read for young adults and adults. It is refreshing to read a novelization using vocabulary like ""desiccation"", ""subsumed"", ""quiescent"", and ""stanchion"". I appreciated the major themes, such as good and evil, more with the book than the film.Not a bad little science fiction jaunt with a fascinating topic. A better ending would have helped tremendously."
1,What a load!,"This is not a good diet. I gained 10lbs on the diet, after losing 5lbs, exercising and this was 8 months post-preg... And after I spent money to get my blood type checked, just to ""be sure"".. I feel so jipped based on buying the book and buying the ""recommended"" pantry items. I'm guessing you have to eat very minimally to make this work. I work out 5 times a week and eat organic now and have lost all but 5 prego pounds."
2,Good Information - Bizarre Food Choices,"After hearing great things about this book and success stories we purchased both this book and the coordinating cook book. While the ""principles,"" were interesting, and insightful, it is not a diet I could stick with nor my husband. The food choices were a bit bizarre, some I never heard of! Not only that, most of the regular foods you've been eating all of your life are banned from his diet, depending on your type. Interesting, but definately not a life long program to stick with."
3,Don't bother of you're B.,"Was disappointed there weren't that many ""highly beneficial"" receipes for blood type b.Get the shopping guide instead.Worth the read if you want all the details behind the theory."
3,Good Book,"This is a good learning book. Use your own best judgement. Nothing is written in stone. Enjoy life, love & happiness."
3,Very Interesting Concept,"I bought this book because it was highly recommended to me by my sister. She knows that I watch what I eat and exercise everyday. However, it is very interesting ""eating for your blood type"". There were far too many things that I just love that were TABOO. I would suggest getting the book from the library to see if this book and kind of eating is for you."
4,Super Book,Love this book....I'm making so many of the recipes and my hubby loves them....it helps being the same blood type!!
2,very basic and boring recipes,"I bought this book and another edition from this authors called eat right for your type. The latter is much better,because it describes what is highly beneficial for your blood type and what you should avoid. After knowing this you can easily integrate this knowledge in your every day cooking. I really expected more from the cook right for your type book! First of all the layout is not very appealing, no colours, no pcitures. The recipes as such are very basic and boring no haute cuisine!!! I think you will soon get tired when eating this every day! I think I will have to look in my favourite cook books and alter the recipes according to my blood type.All in all I cannot really recommend this book. But for people who like basic and simple cooking this book maybe helpful."
2,so disappointed.....,"I found Live Right For Your Type to be fascinating and I couldn't wait to get the cook book to make it easier for me to stick to the diet. These two books contradict each other left and right! One book says don't eat this, the other book says its okay to eat. The other book says this is okay to eat, and then the other book says, no! Don't eat this! WTF?? And the couple of recipes I tried were bland and boring and the sample menu is unrealistic to a full-time working person who doesn't have a lot of money. I am soooooo disappointed in this book. Did D'Adamo even author this book? I know its SAYS he did, but how could he not see all the contradictions?"
4,Cook Right for Your Type,"I heard about the blood type diet from a close friend, so I decided to purchase this book along with the Live Right for Type book. Haven't gotten into the book yet but it seems to be pretty logical when you consider that today's typical diet consist of foods that are not right for you. So I will be reading this one as well as looking forward to purchasing the Eat Right for Type book as well as the encyclopedia. I just find the whole concept pretty intriguing."
2,Recipes lack taste,"I was steered toward the blood type diet by my physician, and believe that the diet works well for some people.My low rating for this book is based on the recipes themselves. I found them lacking in flavor and interest (at least for the A diet). I think the author would do well to consult with some recipe and cuisine experts and combine his theories with more talented food makers."
1,The Recipes are Very Unoriginal and High Glycemic,"I was greatly disappointed in this book - the recipes are so unimaginative and unflavorful. Plus, many seem much too high in carbohydrates, especially the fast acting variety...Too Bad."
2,Cook right for your type,"not impressed, not a diet for me... too many nutrients are left out to meet ""your type"""
5,Simply AMAZING,"My wife started to casually glance at this series of books . .and added 2 + 2 and it actually spelled out the foods that trigger some odd things in her bodyfor instance...my wife has consumed more raw tomatoes & green peppers , than any other person I have knownBUTusually get s fever type blister on her lip monthly. . .WELLher blood type is Not compatible with peppers or tomatoes...she is a faithful fan & follower..."
4,Good information,"Some of the information in the book is not up-to-date, for example, the book recommends avoiding gluten but the recipes call for ingredients with gluten in them. I'm not sure why there is that disconnect in information. But the comprehensive material is still beneficial."
2,Not a useful cookbook,"I was really looking for some practical menu and recipe help to use with the blood type diet. Unfortunately this book did not deliver The recipes contain a lot of ingredients that are hard to find, even at health food stores such as Whole Foods. Also the meal plans often list things, with no explanation and when a dish is suggested in the meal plan it is not always listed in the recipe section. Would have been really helpful if they had starred the items in the menus that had recipes in the book. Very confusing the way it is laid out. Fortunately I bought it used so didn't pay much for it otherwise I would return it."
1,Medical Nonsense,"The idea of a healthy diet being based on blood type is ludicrous nonsense. There is no actual scientific basis to that. Here's the truth for anyone who has claimed to lose weight on this diet: by generally lowering calories and sugar in your diet, you are going to lose weight, no matter what ridiculous fad diet you are on. For people who succeeded on this diet, the success had nothing to do with the silly idea of matching your diet with your blood type and everything to do with generally eating better. You wasted your money."
5,Excellent book,"My husband and I have started this plan and we are doing quite well on it. I wanted a cookbook for easier meals. It is all laid out for you as to which blood type these recipes benefit, are neutral for, and avoidance types. Some of the ingredients are a little hard to find but they are out there. We both feel so much better with this change in lifestyle. Get this book as well as the one for your blood type and start the best change your body will undergo."
4,Great book,"I am really enjoying this book, its helpful because not everyone in my family has the same blood type. This book is easy to use. My only grip about it is that sometimes on the thirty day meal plans, the recipes are not listed in the book. I also do not like the fact that on the meal plans they do not have the page numbers on where to find the recipes. Other than that I really enjoy the eating right for you type books and highly recommend them to everyone."
4,Give Your Tastebuds a Chance,This is a must have book especially when husband and wife are different blood types. I have used several recipes and will continue to experiment.
2,Not what I expected,"I ended up sending this book back. Didn't like the formatting of recipes. While it did identify which recipe was associated with which blood type, this was not very clear. There also seemed to be a lot of ingredients that were not available in the typical grocery store. I think the recipes could have been a little more user friendly. Time was needed to cook most of the recipes, not geared for a family on the go."
3,Cooking Right For Your Blood Type,I received the paper back book right away. The only thing is that the cover is on upside down but not a serioous problem. Looks odd when I read it.I would order again.LO
5,Another Great Baseball Movie,"This is not the greatest movie of all time, but whenever it replays on HBO, I can't NOT watch. Joe Mantegna is great in this, and it has a wonderful, sappy appeal. Why are movies about baseball so good, and the sport itself so booooring?"
3,Fun baseball movie,"I enjoyed ""The Comrades of Summer."" It had better baseball than a lot of sports movies, and the characters were engaging and entertaining. The situation of a hotshot manager who is brought down to earth by his own greed and over-reaching is a cautionary tale for all of us who think the world is our oyster. Having a railroad track running through your practice field's infield gives new meaning to the term ""bad hop."" I thought this was very funny stuff."
2,not horrible,"a fun movie. my biggest problem was with joe mantegna...i just couldn't picture him as a baseball player. i'm a huge baseball fan, and think you would like this film more if you are not really into baseball, but just have a general knowledg of the game. it certainly wasn't a ""good"" movie but it has funny scenes, and is playful. certainly not in the league of other baseball movies, though."
4,"Cheap, but with some surprises","On the one hand, this is just a cheap-o budget CD with only 10 tracks. On the other hand, Sony tosses in some real rarities including:* Christmas Is... (1970, a hard-to-find single)* Ave Maria (1958, from his Columbia LP ""Good Night, Dear Lord"")* When You Wish Upon a Star (1964, from his Mercury LP ""The Wonderful World of Make Believe"")* When a Child Is Born (with Gladys Knight, 1980, a ""Christmas #1"" single in England)...plus a couple of rarely compiled tracks, ""The Sounds of Christmas"" and ""Christmas Day"", from his 1963 and 1969 Christmas albums, respectively.So, even if you have a bunch of Johnny Mathis Christmas albums (and lawdy, there are a bunch), you may not have these tracks."
3,I could have made this myself,I love p funk but I was expecting something new and interesting these are old songs and I could like download them myself.
2,Useful only for the most hard core pilots & instructors,"The Aeronautical Chart User's Guide consists of five parts:1. Explanation of VFR and IFR terms and symbols 2. Listing of NOAA (now FAA) Aeronautical products 3. Aeronautical Planning Chart Symbols 4. VFR Chart Symbols 5. IFR Chart SymbolsSection 1 provides several pages of interesting background on the charts you'll use in flying. This is the most generally useful part of the publication, especially the highlight of military training routes and class C. If you want to stump your instructor, ask him or her why the Maximum Elevation Figure (MEF) varies between 0 - 300 feet above the actual highest depicted object on the VFR sectional chart. (For the answer, email me or consult page 4 :-)The remainder of the book is thorough, but most pilots won't use it becuase 99% of what you'll need to identify on a chart is listed on that chart's legend page. Thus, this book is really useful only for the most hard core pilots and instructors."
4,boss of bosses,"good movie, very slow moving for mafia action. some points are wrong about the true castellano. chazz is a good actor but wrong for this part. still a recommended buy for a serious collector of mob movies."
3,"Functions well, but will be very rust-prone.","I bought this along with the new stainless-braided 10psi controller. The controller is great. Wish I could say the same about this. It's basically the same as the one it's replacing, which means that it's cast-iron, poorly finished. That means that leaving it outside for one or two periods of rainy weather will turn it to a pile of rust. I don't know what they use to ""paint"" this thing, but it doesn't work. So, before this new one goes into service (and into a life of rain/humidity) I'm going to disassemble it. Then it gets a good wire-brushing and a couple of coats of Rustoleum High-Temp manifold enamel. That ought to keep it usable for a lot longer than it is in its factory finish. I recommend that you do the same thing. And while you're at it. you can smooth off the rough spots in the burner area which will make the flame a bit more uniform.Otherwise, it's a good companion for the 10psi controller."
4,Cast Iron Replacement Burner,Rock solid replacement for the one I had which corroded. This one I believe has better distribution of the flame as well.
3,More Educational than Relaxing,This book contained several exercises to help relax and explored a variety of different medical treatments available to help those who are suffering from stress.I was most surprised by a chapter detailing hypnosis and dispelling common misconceptions about it.
5,The Best !,I have a young son who is 13 and he shows an interest in auto repair. I was in the market for a comprehensive book that would give him a good understanding of automotive principals and theory. Well I certainly found it in this book.
2,"There should be more Westerns, but not like this","Whoever wrote this saw one too many episodes of Deadwood because it has more F-words in the first scene than what you might hear in a gangster movie. The action scenes feature cuts between every punch and there are lots of weird pauses during conversations. You'll probably hear a lot of complaints about the editing and direction on this one. In the end, it's pretty forgettable. You can watch it streaming on Netflix if you want to check it out right now, though."
4,It's a western for people who like westerns.... DUH!,"This is a new western... will it go down as a classic -- no. But, I have seen those classic westerns, know their plots inside out and this is a decent recent film that certainly does justice to those famous western good/evil conflicts. It is not entirely unpredictable, but who thought John Wayne wasn't going to ride off into the sunset?"
1,"Poor quality, not stimulating enough","My son received this table as a gift, and we liked it for about the first week. Pieces broke really easily, and the bridge piece never fit the track correctly so it wanted to keep lifting out. This frustrated my toddler to no end. Plus, compared with wooden or other train sets that you can change and rearrange, this table is completely static -- all there is is a windy loop of track, and that gets dull very quickly. Add to that the fact that there was no lid with our table, and it's become a pretty useless and large hunk of junky plastic. Can't wait until Santa brings a wooden train table and set for Christmas, so we can pass this one along to another home! If your kid(s) are into trains at all, skip this one and spend the money on a set that you can add to and use in different ways."
2,cheap plastic,I bought this for my 4 and 2 year old boys. My 4 year old broke the signal off the house the first day!. The actual table is durable but not the track pieces. Made of very cheap plastic. The bridge is removable and didn't fit in it's space well. I don't know if I will buy from stage 2 again. Stick with little tikes!
1,BORING,"This table got many good reviews and looked like fun, so I ordered it. It isn't worth the space that it takes up! The train on it barely chugs along and my two grandsons (age 2) are only interested for a couple of minutes. Maybe they will like it better when they get a little older, but for now seems very boring! Wish I would have spent my money on something else!!"
3,Fun Train Table,"This toy is sturdy and fun, but I would only recommend buying for younger children who are just starting out in their interests in trains. I wouldn't pay full retail price and I'm glad I got it at about 60% off. Why? Because obviously you can't move the tracks around. My 3-year-old has a lot of fun with it, but I know it's not going to be a hit for years."
3,price changing on amazon?,"I was going to purchase this, as well as several other items this morning for the kids. But, I noticed that this items price jumped from $39 to $79 overnight. There was another item that jumped up in price from $60 to $84 during the time I was shopping last night. Neither item mentioned that they were on any kind of temporary price reduction. What's up with amazon? Is this Christmas price gouging? Or do they always change prices once stuff is in your shopping cart? This is the first time I have noticed it. It makes me much less likely to buy anything from Amazon after seeing this. Everybody seems to offer free shipping these days, I just purchased this item from the manufacturers website for $49. Will let you know how it is."
4,Good for a while,"This table is sturdy and has held up well over the past year. Even with a child, cats and dogs on top of it. No complaints with the toy itself. The pieces last and fit well where they belong. The toy was fun at first, but because you can't change or move the tracks, it gets a little old after a while. For a few months, my son never left this toy. Now, it's taking up space and being replaced this year for Christmas.For the money, it's worth buying. I've had friends and family buy bigger, better tables and the child loses interest just as quick. I would buy it again, but I wouldn't expect it to last years and years (unless in a daycare or multi-child setting possibly.)"
2,disappointed,the shipping was fast and the price was really cheap but there are some missing pages. I had to buy a new one because I can't find the pages I have to read.
5,LOVE IT!,"I bought this CD as a compromise for my classroom. As a devoted parrothead, I could listen to Buffett and day however some of the lyrics are not quite child friendly. This CD was a way to marry the two parts of my life. It started as my indoor recess music for volume control. If I couldn't hear the music, the kids were too loud. The kids loved it! By the end of the school year I was playing it all the time, during quiet writting time, anytime I wasn't teaching. If only businesses would use this for elevator music or while you are on hold!"
2,john deer seat,what was sent was in good shape but there were no mounting brackets. It is useless in the in the form sentDG
3,"Disappointed, almost didn't finish","I wish I would have checked this book out of the library instead of buying it. I have read much better legal suspense thrillers....I considered putting this book on the shelf without finishing it. Shank was such an awful character, too bad he didn't get poisoned by eating the fish, but he did get what he deserved in the end. This book didn't become a ""page turner"" soon enough."
1,Worst book I've read this year,"I can not believe the good reviews for this book. I don't have particuarly strict standards, but I thought this one was a real stinker, a pot boiler of the worst kind. The female clerk is supposed to be brilliant but she acts like a moron. She's always being rescued or is screaming or having her clothes ripped off or admiring the hero's ""muscular arms"". The characters are cartoonish, the judges behave in a preposterous way, the dialogue is straight from a comic book and everyone is always winking conspiratorially or performing some other cliche. It's really just.... ridiculous, pulp fiction of the worst kind. If you must read it, by all means, wait for the paperback."
2,unbelievable characters and sloooow moving.,"This book at 560 pages is about 200 pages too many! The main character is a totally unbelievable former stripper, super intelligent law clerk that does some incredibly STUPID stuff!!! The book plods along and was a downright disappointment!!! I couldn't even justify finishing it, because to tell you the truth I was never invested in these characters so I didn't care what happened, not that you couldn't guess!!"
2,"This is a soap opera, somewhat unrealistic failure.","We found the book to be formula in nature, can you imagine a supreme court judge, already guilty of sexual harassment hiring another bimbo! Evil bad guys, but just not believable. Read Martini instead."
2,levine sells out,"Fans of Levine's hard-edged and colorful Jake Lassiter books will be in for a dismal surprise when they read _9 Scorpions_, Levine's apparent attempt to break out of the Miami crime genre and reach the mainstream. This is pure soap opera trash, complete with one-dimensional characters, gratuitous sex and violence, and the requisite power-mongering by cardboard cut-out villians. Jacqueline Suzanne could have written this pap. In fact, I wondered if Levine hired a ghost writer. The so-called ""love story"" between a Supreme Court judge and his assistant is laughable. We could care less about these spoiled Washington D.C. yuppies. Please, Paul, bank your profits on this TV-movie garbage and let's get back to Lassiter, a man the reader can care about."
4,real history of a forgotten time,"Why would a Dane write about American Merchant Seamen from two centuries ago? Because two of those brave & articulate men, landed up on Henrik Christensen's peninsula to survive & recover there, after the ship in which they were impressed was stranded.While WILL I AM is written in novel form, it contains, verbatim, log entries & letters home from American Merchant Seamen William Watson, John Brown & Amos Stevens, penned between 1805 & 1812, during their forced service aboard British warships, their incarcerations, together with their own family histories.WILL I AM is an uncut diamond, the stuff for which ardent Readers of history - real history - yearn & hunt."
4,Historically Important,"Considering it's age and filming techniques, this is a great record of two eras of the band. Everyone craves the first incarnation, but I'm very happy with this release. The audio tracks don't work in my player but do in the computer, and these comprise more than half the playing time of disc 2 (earlier group 1974). What exciting shows these must have been for those lucky enough to have been there."
3,The Real Deal Is At YouTube,"I'm looking forward to seeing what this DVD holds, but have only just come across it here today. I understand the disappointment of some reviewers, as I was at the recording of Nothingness & Eternity in Central Park and saw the second incarnation with Ponty there as well. each band had it's merits, but only the first had that amazing fire. I am guessing that the rift between the individuals who comprised MO Prime still exists or that McLaughlin is trying to distance himself from that band for some reason. But you CAN see some of the performances like Dance of Maya at YouTube, albeit kind of grainy. But considering the age and the sources, better than nothing."
3,Bad product description:,"I buyed this DVD as a Jonh Mclauglin fan, Me and my wife loved the Apocalypse in 1974 with the london symphony orch as one of our best records ever, but....The video is not complete ,and we know exists....The product description says there are three video songs in mahvishnu 1974.There are ONLY TWO!!!!WHY!!!!! The all mahavisnu 1974 video in montreux exists!!!!!! look in youtube!!!!!!"
2,Don't Buy It,There is a lot of missing video - just audio. What a ripoff! I will hold out for real video of the original M.O.!
4,Good book overral,"This Book doesn't analize the exchange Ruy Lopez in deep, but explain you the main ideas in all important lines, with examples and commentaries. Good for somebody who wants to learn a new opening, or like me who wants to play the Open Spanish but I need to face some other variations and be prepared for that. It's all about ideas not for memorize,The author mentions in page 5 that this is the kind of openings ""analysed through the endgame"" I'll be happy if I see a chapter that connect this opening with the endgame and give us some tips on that for future editions."
3,Ultra Clear Telephone,"It makes the sounds louder, but not clearer. Has some value but not as much as expected from the description of this product."
4,great bag overall,"I've used this bag for almost a year, and it has held up well. I don't use the smaller bags that came with it, but like the number of inside pockets. I wanted a backpack instead of a shoulder bag, because I always was close to hitting my son as I was bending down to pick him up. The size is good for outings to the mall and such. I do wish that there were other closures on the outside instead of the velcro, which sometimes doesn't hold that great. It would also be nice if there was an easy access outside pocket, but overall this bag has been great. I do use it as a purse/diaper bag and would likely buy it again."
3,It's ok for the price but not great.,"I got this backpack at Christmas last year. It is ok, but it is very stiff and not very comfortable to wear. The pockets on the sides are a little small to hold sippy cups and it is not as spacious as it looks. I have a 2 1/2 year old and another on the way and I will have to get a bigger bag for sure. I do love the backpack style but this one is just not big enough to carry stuff for 2 kids."
3,"Nice, but uncomfortable.","This is a lovely bag with lots of nice little extras, but it is not as comfortable as I would have liked. I ended up giving it away after a few weeks of struggling with the stiff shoulder straps and wishing I had bought the similar one that is designed as a tote. It's nice to look at, but uncomfortable to wear as a backpack and it doesn't really work as a shoulder bag. (Some backpacks do okay when you wear them over one shoulder. This one didn't for me.)It was especially annoying to put on over a winter coat."
4,Rare opportunity to enjoy Phil Wilson on CD,"This CD needs to be reviewed as two separate works. The Wizard of Oz Suite is interesting, but to me of only marginal interest. The second half shows why Phil Wilson is an innovative arranger of big band jazz and enjoyable soloist, going back to his Woody Herman tour in the 60s. As a teacher at Berklee, his recordings are much too infrequent. I wish he recorded big bands more often and his rare albums were available on CD."
5,EXCELLENT AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND!!!,The book explains complex concepts in an easy and relax manner. The author makes the reader feel at ease with the complicated world of hypnosis.
1,Don't Buy--Poor Quality,"Absolutely DO NOT buy these. Not only did almost half of them arrive broken, but the red color transferred onto everything. It actually stained my countertops! I tried washing one four times and it still got everywhere."
4,Paper Plate Holder,"Well since I thought I was purchasing 2 plate holders at $16.00, and ordered 2 sets, I guessed that they were going tobe superior to others. But what I got were 24 plate holders sent in 3 boxes, so I guess I got a very good deal. Either the ad online is incorrect or you were just clearing out your warehouse for new stock. Either way I guess I got what I wanted......"
1,pretty much junk,they sent me another one because i gave them bad feedback but I didnt really want another one and after receiving the other one and realizing that it was junk as well as the first one I was just pretty much disgusted that I wasted my money. Buyers dont waste your time on this piece of junk it doesnt sound remotely real and its just cheaply made and a bad buy all around.
4,Very interesting segment,"I teach high school psychology, and this segment is very good for showing the limitations of memory and the dangers of reconstructed memories.It's short enough to be shown in a typical high school period and still allow time for discussion and reflection."
2,whistles are out of date.,"one dumb magna!!! the only reason i gave it two stars is because i like soccer.its one of thouse dumb no vilonce BIG DEAL IF I SPRANG MY ANKLE kinda magnas.its WAY to dramatic for me but if u like one of thouse drama queen soccer playing wimp magnas i'll garantie you'll like this magna.i dont, but if your looking for something more actioney try et cetera for ages 10+ and zatch bell,one pice,and rave master for ages 11+.and if your looking for comedy try zatch bell and ledgendz.from magna loveing whistle hateing \\zatch bell fan"
2,Soccer.,"When I read this book I didn't feel like it was very good. I thought that this was going to be one of my favorites with Prince of Tennis. The author doesn't do that well of making the book seem exciting. There was a little 'underdog' drama but I was easily bored by the lack intensity. Soccer is much more intense than it is portrayed in this book. I was dissapointed since soccer is a huge thing for me. Practically everyone that I know plays soccer and this manga made it seem like such a wimp sport...If you are looking for a sport related manga I recommend Prince of Tennis. Even if you aren't into tennis (like a lot of people I know in the US...) it is still a great book. One Piece is another good manga that I like, the main character has a lot of determination and tries to overcome his goals."
2,"Network ""Movie of the Week"" Fare. Pass This by.","Unless you have a crush on Sean Connery you won't like this movie. Implausible and Poorly Developed Plot, Non-Existent Character Development, and Bad Directing."
3,"Not what I was expecting, but my mistake.","I went to see Trans Siberian Orchestra and thought this was a oldie but goodie from them, but it isn't and it was all my mistake. Have tried to sell it as I am not interested in it, but no takers yet. Going to list again as I really have no need for it. I assume it is O.K., but truthfully really had no desire to listen to it once I realized I didn't buy what I thought I was buying."
2,Trans Siberian Express,I did not care for this at all nor did I like the other one I bought.Not my kind of music.Mary Lynn
2,Mediocre,"I checked this book out for some background research on a paper that I'm working on for a conference. I had hoped it would be more scholarly and was quite disappointed.This is a Tom Peterseque foray into the topic. And, that's fine, if you like that genre of work. I'm sure that my partner would eat up this book...and for a Saturday read, I'd leaf through this book.However, noting that the book crosses different disciplines (inner jacket) proves a false assertion. Frankly, I can see how another reviewer referred to this book as ""pseudo"" intellectual. The boot fits."
3,Enjoyed,"I enjoyed this book but not as much as ""How They Grew"". Polly is annoying because she does a lot of crying."
1,Poor follow up,"Needed this product to be right when I received it but it wasn't!!! Threads had to be RETHREADED to have the supply line nipple fit and the ports had to be cleaned before the burners would light properly. Did this at my own expense because I didn't have time to return the product. NO REFUND FROM THE SUPPLIER FOR THIS INCURRED EXPENSE. JUST SOMEONE WHO COULDN'T SPEAK OR TYPE ENGLISH SAYING THEY WOULD DO THE ""NEEDFUL""?! I'm guessing that means IGNORE THIS CUSTOMER because I haven't received any further communication from them. My suggestion to anyone who is contemplating buying from AceHardwareWarehouse, DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Not As Good As The Book,"This movie didn't follow the book that much. It pretty much got rid of half the characters and most of Renee's philosophical thoughts. Paloma was more of the main main character in this movie, which I thought was interesting because I've always like Paloma better. Although this movie was a condensed version of the book, it was still pretty moving. I recommend it to readers of The Elegance of the Hedgehog."
2,SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!! I was extremely disappointed with the ending!,"I absolutely adored this movie, but was unhappy with the ending. If you are looking for a fairytale ending, you will not find it with this movie. That being said, the movie was superbly written, the characters were complex and loveable. Truly an outstanding movie and I fell in love with the characters."
2,don't bother,"boring, boring, boring. the main girl was so unlikeable i could barely watch the thing. i appreciate eccentric characters and their nuances, but this girl was annoying and pretentious. the only good part was the japanese guy. if you want to watch a ""quirky"" movie, this one might fool you into thinking you've hit the jackpot...but don't be fooled...be ready for a total yawn-fest."
1,Dismal Movie,"The trailer looked great, and as often happens, the best scenes were there. Overall a dismal movie focusing on a dysfunctional family and their landlord. A few bright spots were overshadowed by the worst ending ever! If you are into hopelessness, this might be for you."
2,Read the book,The subtitles were grossly inadequate in conveying the depth of thought in this story. Read the book for a thought provoking experience.
4,a bittersweet story,"Fascinating film on how a widowed retiring concierge is almost invisible to the well to do inhabitants of the apartment block; and how through the efforts of an reclusive child, with suicidal ideations and a widowed Japanese resident slowly overcome her years of reticence and open her up to new life.The concierge ,although gauche and unsophisticated is a voracious reader, a fact she jealously strives to conceal.When she starts to accept that her awkwardness is of little consequence to the girl and the Japanese gentleman she begins to gain in confidence and in turn this turn helps the little girl gain a new perspective on life and enriches the Japanese resident...very good acting, a measured pace... a film you can immerse yourself in and savour the unfolding enrichment of three lives...I thoroughly enjoyed it"
3,Okay,"This was a disappointment after reading the book. However ""the elegance of the hedgehog"" is a difficult book to translate for the screen due to the extensive internal thoughts of the two main characters."
4,"Patience Will Be Rewarded. The Film is Slow-moving, Yet Powerful","Anyone who has felt alone, like they don't fit in, or un-deserving will be able to identify with this movie. The film moves slowly until the character, Mr. Ozu, enters the picture. Stellar acting, directing, and screenplay (I did not read the book). Those who dislike the movie are probably uncomfortable with real people and emotions."
4,A success...mostly,"This film, based on the novel The Elegance of the Hedgehog by Muriel Barbery, is delightful and captures the quirkiness of the characters very well. Unfortunately, I read the book first, which is one of my favorite books ever, which is deeply thoughtful and more philosophical, as we are privy to the characters' thoughts. A film can only attempt to reflect these thoughts in a 3 dimensional way and can't fully succeed, naturally. The poignance of understanding the ""hedgehog's"" personality and the reasons for her lifestyle choices is only possible in the book. The precocious little girl Paloma, however, is captured more completely through her actions on film. The casting is spot on, and this film contains much of the humor, drama and essence of the book's themes. I really enjoyed it and will watch it again and again."
3,not what I expected,"I have an earlier book from author Ades that had text that was very good. I bought this book thinking Hallucenogenic Torreador would definately be in it- one of his most interesting optical illusions...and it wasn't in there!Pictures are big but I think she could have used more that she didnt. I sent it back as it wasnt worth $40... if it would have been in paperback and cheaper, I would have thought twice. Hope this helps."
1,False Advertising,"Why does Amazon allow companies to post information about products that are false. The Manufacturer states 2 tablespoons for 14 grams of protein. However, the container states you need to use 4 tablespoons for the same about of protein. basically you get half the protein or use twice as much as advertised. THis is just not right."
3,If protein per serving matters to you...,"Just a note to those like me who are looking for a high protein concentration per serving: There is a customer image on this page from 2006 that shows 14g protein per 2 tbsp. Thus I ordered it. I received it today, and found the image to be outdated. The product I received has 13g protein per 4 tbsp. I uploaded up-to-date images to show this."
2,All around awful experience,"My first issue with this product is the manner in which they treated my order. I was told to expect my order within 5-8 business days and it took 2 weeks to simply ship it, and another 2 or 3 weeks for the product to arrive.When I finally relieved the package, I did not like the product whatsoever, the only reason I haven't shipped it back is because of the terrible experience I had receiving the powder.I've mixed this product into various drinks, all of which are overpowered by the hemp seed powder. Terrible, terrible taste. I still have it just because I don't want to throw it out. And I'll try and use as much of as I can bare simply because I don't want to waste it."
5,hemp protein powder in dessert,"Just bought this Hemp powder for adding some protein to my diet, but was discouraged upon reading reviews regarding what it's good to mix it with.However, with my being an ""ice cream-aholic"", I decided to try a rounded-teaspoon of this hemp powder stirred into a scoop of Costco's high-fat vanilla ice cream, and it tasted great!So I added another heaping teaspoon to it, and find it easily edible, and am going to have a second serving.Although I was aiming for high protein/low sugar/low salt/low junk additive product.....I was going to eat the ice cream sometime today anyway. So why not ""require"" myself to add this protein to it when I have ice cream....at least until I have a chance to purchase some of the other suggested items to mix this hemp powder with."
5,Love it,"It took me a while to get used to the taste. But now that I have, I absolutely love it. Plain organic yogurt with hemp tastes delicious, granted I only use 1-2 teaspoons per cup. It's a great pre-workout supplement as I have noticed more endurance. If you're keen on flavor, this product might not be for you. Try the vanilla flavored one."
2,Anyone want the rest of mine?,"Strongly horrible tasting. I've been enjoying smoothies that are more than half greens (kale, chard, etc.) with chia and ground flaxseed thrown in - so it's not as if I demand 100% sweet - but this stuff, even at a quarter of the recommended dosage, takes ""must be good for you"" to a new level. Or should I say ""to a new low."""
2,"OMG, if you have an iron tummy than buy","I can eat anything, I had squid jerky the other day from my friend from Japan, no worries, ate it like a champ. I drink coffee at work after it has been simmering on the burner for four hours, no worries. This stuff takes it to the next level and than some, if you are steel stomach savant than buy it, if not, look elsewhere."
2,Mmmmmm. Sand...,"I wouldn't call this protein powder. The particles are way to large. Maybe protein granules? Protein grains? Guess it just doesn't have the same ring. It doesn't taste bad, in fact it doesn't really taste like anything when I mix into a shake, but it's almost like sand and never really dissolves at all. If you don't mind eating sand though, this is the product for you!"
4,Great in smoothies,"I've just started using this in smoothies. I have been put off by the texture and flavor of many protein powders, but this one is great. I've been limiting dairy and high-carb juices and fruits, so I make a ""coconut"" smoothie every morning: light coconut milk (NOT CREAM), this hemp powder, a teaspoon of raw coco powder, chia seeds, and a very small amount of sweetner (I use Stevia). Blend with ice and enjoy! I've also put frozen coffee cubes in this smoothie...sort of like an iced frappe in the morning. Delish!"
4,It is not bad :),"I was put off at first by the GREEN powder! But, it isn't that bad. There is a little of a grainy texture in the smoothie and it is a tad nutty, but not a strong nut flavor. I use a non-dairy (blue almond) vanilla milk (around 5-6 oz) , 1-2 bananas, 4-5 strawberries, 2-3 crushed icecubes and a couple scoops and blend it in the blender. It isn't that bad....and if color is an issue and you have to have everything a pretty color, than...natural is not the road to go ;) [...]"
3,Choke on less protein than advertised,"After nearly finishing one container of this, I cannot reorder.A serving is 4 tablespoons for 13 grams of protein. Try to choke that down. That's about 5 grams of protein for a tablespoon. The recommended daily intake is 56 grams for most men and 46 for most women (more if you're active or body building).I find I can mix about 1 Tablespoon with a banana. (The reviewer who says this tastes like bananas is bananas).I can mix about 1 T. in a bowl of soup.I can mix about 1 Tablespoon in a serving of yogurt.This tastes horrible in Bob's Redmill Oats. It's making me hate my homemade yogurt. Tried it in hummus...did not make me happy. It's making foods that I love into foods that I'll eat because they have some chance of carrying hemp.I find it difficult to eat 4 tablespoons of this daily."
5,The Best Latin Pop Album of the Year!!!!!,"Get ready to enjoy the best pop album of the year, sang by the most sublime voice in Latin America. After so many hits and albums, Yolandita brings a fresh sound in her latest CD. There are modern beautiful ballads like ""Si Tu Te Vas""...moving lyrics like ""Me Quedo en Soledad"" and ""Para Que Seguir Viviendo""...wonderful instrumentation like ""Te Vine a Buscar"". The dance rendition of ""La Luna"" will be burning the dance floors and beach parties in months to come...great work Yolandita, get ready for many more fans than the thousands you already have!"
4,The GREAT singer is back&#65533;,"Puertorican Diva Yolandita Monge is back with a refreshing collection of good songs and of course she ALWAYS excels with her amazing voice. I hope she gets a good exposure with this CD, she definetly deserves it. This is an excellent pop CD."
3,"Sneakers look good, but.....",".....the first time I played tennis in them they cut up the back of my feet. When I put them on they felt comfortable and maybe I should've broken them in more before playing in them, but I must say it is the first time my feet bled after playing tennis. They're good looking sneakers so I just wear them for hanging out - they can handle that."
1,Never received the item,I never received this item. It was sent to the wrong address and the company wasn't very helpful in helping us. We asked for a refund and got that.
1,Cardcaptors verses Cardcaptor Sakura,"This, along with the other Cardcaptors videos, is horrible. If you wanted it for a 5 year old, I can understand that. But the original anime was geared towards 13 and up children. TheUS version does NOT do Cardcaptor Sakura justice. If you want something with more of a plot, MUCH better voices, good songs, great friendships and actual emotions, then I suggest getting Cardcaptor Sakura videos which are subtitled in english for those who can't understand Japanese. The quality of this video (I have seen the english episodes) is not very good, and most of the plots and intricate details have been whiped out."
1,Hi!(don't have a good title),"I really don't reccomend you buy this. If you like Cardcaptors then you should LOVE the origanal. The music is much better, they don't cut-out so much, and the voices are much better. The episodes are also in order. Thanks lot for listening, and I hope you find this helpful. You won't regret getting CCS instead of this."
3,Well....,"My favorite show on TV happens to be Cardcaptors, and I was aware that they had cut out alot of the plot and whatnot, but as I explored online I learned alot more. It's sad that WB felt that they had to cut out everything. *tear* This has all lit a fire under me and as soon as I get $$$ I will be spending it on the Cardcaptor Sakura VHS's! I may be 15, but I still love a great cartoon and I'm sad that my favorite cartoon is nothing like it's origional. Hopefully, WB and Nelvana will see the error in their ways and do it right (somehow I doubt this)."
5,"Great Episodes, Terrible Cuts.","Ok. I'm giving this too many stars but I just cant do this to one of my favorite episodes. I have never seen the Japanese version of the Firey episode so I don't know how good or horrible it really is. The show is great. The cuts and voices are horrific. I can sorta get over Sakura's voice. She has a half decent one but poor Kero-chan. He sounds like a New York City cab driver. Li I can get over too. But Tomoyo.(Tear drop) OK she now has one of the worse voices EVER! OK buy this DVD if you are a Cardcaptors fan, but if you are a Cardcaptor Sakura fan DON'T THINK ABOUT IT! EVEN IF I'M LOOKING FOR THIS DVD DON'T LOOK FOR IT! IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY! NELVANA CHANGED IT TOO MUCH! JUST DONT BUY IT! Unless you are a CC fan don't buy this DVD unless you are upsessed with the episodes in English.(Sorry if I made any grammatical errors or spelling errors.)"
3,The cut and uncut version are equally good!,"Cardcaptors and cardcaptor sakura are equally good. The uncut version is aiming for older people 13+ and nelvanas cut version is aiming for aroung 12 yr olds. The voices are brilliant on the cut and im not so sure about the uncut voices.Hope you find the cut and uncut version of cardcaptors equally good!! Although the original has more friendship, emotions and more of a plot."
5,Best Of The Best,This Action Packed Movie Is Based On 3 Episodes Called 1. The Third Element 2. Buyer Beware 3. Stormy Weather This Is A Must SEE Movie Its A Great Video And It Comes Out On July 10.
3,"Looks like this movie was filmed in Austin, Texas",In the movie Loni's character returns to hometown after 15 yrs. Witnesses a murder. The murderer turns out to be her sisters husband.
5,LOve that LONI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a great movie of Loni's! One of her last tv movies and really good. It is suspenceful and well acted. Loni looks fantastic as always. Greg Evigan plays a great bad guy and is also still not hard to look at.
5,Amazing Photography,"This book had beautiful photographs, also amazing stories of Linda's times in the 60's. I especially liked the intimate view of her and Paul's life and their children. Extremely glad I purchased the product."
1,Makes your wrist sweat,Not good at all for a sports watch. My wrist becomes itchy and sweaty from the rubber strap. Shouldn't your skin be able to breathe when you're working out?
5,Best Knives Ever!!,"I love, love, love these knives. I gave them to 4 of my adult kids for Christmas and they love them as well. They are so incredibly sharp that I find myself wandering around the kitchen looking for things to slice and chop. They hold an edge well too."
4,"bad seed,sad seed","This is a really good movie...i mean,good intentions gone awry,somehow.Luke Wilson was a bit boring and unemotional.But Norman Reedus gives a great performance,as usual."
4,JK,"Although this guy is rock'n a sweet 80's skullet, the DVD is very informative. Pedal steel is not for the light hearted and probably one of the most complex instruments but this DVD does a good job at breaking down scales, licks, muting techniques, etc. At times this guy loses his place and/or speeds ahead too quick but just plant to use your pause button. It's not a perfect lesson plan but there is quite a bit of useful information to absorb here. One warning, if you get caught by your girlfriend watching this DVD, you are bound to take some heat as this guy is pretty goofy looking....sorry Bruce Bouton..."
5,"Barney Miller, A must have.","This is a Must have for any Barney Miller Fan. All Uncut and Beautiful Quality.Also Including the Short lived (and Hilarious) Spin off ""Fish"""
4,"Great buy, BUT...","With only two seasons of Fish in existence, why include just the first one? Don't get me wrong, as bonus materials go, that's amazing, but why not throw in the second half too, so that the entire Barney Miller legacy can be housed in one package? If Fish: Season Two is released (due to overwhelming demand, of course), I'll have to buy that too and prop it up next to the box set. Why not just put the rest of it into the box and charge an additional $10?"
5,Barney Miller the Complete Set,"Finally someone has come out with the complete series of a very funny older show. Its too bad that everyone who bought previous uncomplete sets is stuck with them. I too bought the first three seasons and waited for more to come out; I also bought from Columbia House years ago on VHS tapes hoping for a complete series. Oh well thats water over the dam. Started watching these and so far I am pleased, good job shout."
5,Barney Miller dvd,Everything great. Picture and sound real good for being filmed years ago. Would highly recommend to anyone liking Barney Miller.
2,Poor quality recording,I loved this show and was looking forward to watching it on DVD. The quality of the recording is just terrible. Looks like someone filmed it off of their tv using their camcorder. very bad picture. The set was expensive and I expected a much better product for the price.
1,The hustle is on...,I go along with the other disgruntled reviewers who paid for the first three seasons only to be sandbagged with this box set. This is an opitional purchase that I will never make.
1,Simply amazing...,"Agree with the rest of the folks, to only produce a total package now, after already selling seasons 1, 2 and 3, just isn't right, can't rationalize buying it for the remainder, only hope is that they will SEE some of these comments and sell them individually for those that already purchased the earlier ones...:-(G2"
1,Buy a box set?? Corporate Rip off,"I agree with everyone that has posted a comment regarding the box set. I too purchased the first three seasons and REFUSE to buy a box set unless the distributor is willing to reimburse me for the cost of the first three seasons. What a sham, ripoff, etc. I was really looking forward to getting season 4 for this Christmas. Well you know what? I will watch Barney Miller repeats on TV in Chicago. They are available Monday-Friday at 2:30 pm on ME-TV through Comcast Cable. Screw you corporate world. You won't get my money. Yes I would like to own the set but I have principles, unlike the suit and tie crowd."
1,bombastic!!!,"I also have seasons 1,2 and 3. Have been waiting (for years) for 4th season. Now the audacity to come out with a ""BOX SET"". Horse feathers, and a pox on their house. I for one will never buy what I already own. Boy, did you guys blow this one!!!"
5,Great to finally have,Its great to finally have this complete series available. Before this I only had seasons 1-3 that I could get unedited and the rest of the series from a tvland recording. Its amazing how many little jokes got edited out for syndicaton. I got this a a christmas gift and it was one of my favorite things that I got starting to watch Fish now. The special features are well worth watching as well
4,Old memories,Bought this as gift for someone. Watched a few episodes. Brought back many old memories of when I used to watch it w/family. No problems w/viewing. Everything clear.
5,GREAT LOOK AT 70'S BASEBALL,"IF YOU LIVED THRU THE 70'S AND FOLLOWED BASEBALL, THIS IS A GREAT REMINDER OF THE EVENTS THAT SHAPED THAT DECADE OF BASEBALL. FROM THE OAKLAND DYNASTY, BIG RED MACHINE, AND HAMMERIN HANK OVERTAKING THE BABE THIS WAS A GREAT 10 YEARS OF THE GRAND OLD GAME. THIS BOOK TAKES THE READER ON A NOSTALGIC TRIP THRU TIME. PHIL PEPE DOES A GREAT JOB RECALLING THIS MUST READ BOOK. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR BASEBALL HISTORIANS AND ALL BASEBALL FANS."
5,Space Battels,"AS the White Fang preps. for battle aginsed MO2 and Treiz, the gundams begin to attach. With the war raging, Relena trys to talk some scents intoher brother. Heero comes to the rescue and takes Relena to Peace Million, after talking with Millardo. And in the rage of war, Catre discovers that Libras mobile dolls are controlled by the Zero System. Next on Gundam Wing Episode 44 The Beggining of the End."
3,"Good songs, but not as advertised","This is NOT Waylon's classic 1972 album ""Ladies Love Outlaws"". Although this isn't even billed as a 'greatest hits' collection the songs in this disc are from various albums from 1972 to 1982. There doesn't appear to be a good reason for this album to exist, except maybe to make the record label (BMG) a few bucks. Still, there are some great songs here, such as ""Waltz Across Texas""; some of these can't be found elsewhere. Hopefully, Buddha records (which has recently rereleased some of Waylon's best albums) will get around to putting the original ""Ladies Love Outlaws"" out on CD as well as others like ""Lonesome, Onry, and Mean""."
5,LADIES LOVE OUTLAWS,"THIS CD IS ONE OF THE BEST BY WAYLON. THE SONGS ARE GREAT, AND THE LAST ONE (HE WENT TO PARIS) IS THE BEST. IT IS A JIMMY BUFFET SONG WITH A STEEL GUITAR. THIS IS OUTLAW COUNTRY."
3,Only if you're a obessed fan. Not in stock!,"My all time favourite movie - I thought that this would be money worth spent because it comes with the original story. Only problem is Amazon don't have this in stock anymore so I was directed to buy it second hand. It came much much cheaper, 15 cents, in all right condtion but the pages were rotted a bit.The book was poorly written, it lacked detail and dicriptions of the wonderful landsapce of the story and just focused on the plot and the dialouge.And the original story is enough to make anyone go to sleep."
3,Exciting Novel,Sleepy Hollow (the new version) was a very exciting tale. It is quite different from the original version yet contained more thrilling events. The beginning was a little slow but the last couple chapters wizzed by. The original story was short and could have elaborated more on the last scene to make it better. All in all it was a good novel
3,"If you loved Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow, this book is a must","This book is awesome for one who enjoyed Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow, and are interested of reading the Washington Irving story which the movie was based upon. That is what happened with me. And you can't go wrong for this great price you can get both.Sleepy Hollow by Tim Burton the book has much added dialogue and scenes that wern't seen in the movie, and Washington Irving's Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a timeless classic but it didn't intrigue me as much as Tim Burton's version."
5,Simply Wonderful,"When I got this album off of a used CD shelf one summer it got me hooked. It was one of the first two jazz albums I ever bought, and put me on the road to a life-long love affair with both Burrell and Coltrane. Recorded when both Burrell and Coltrane were on the rise, it is simply beautiful and gives some hint to the greatness to come from Coltrane (it was recorded when he was still playing with Miles Davis). In short, if you buy this album you will not regret it."
4,wait a minute,"well im a litle white kid but i hate 50 he's pop him and buck should go have a ""good time"" with lloyd skanks and tony heyhoe. any way I like that real N.W.A, Dr.Dre, Snopp dogg, Game, M.O.B., Eastwood, Tupac, and D-block stuff and sheek fits in with them. go D-Block, nas , F Fat Joe , F Gitty Cent, GI GU GI GI G-UNOT"
2,dissapointed,"I bought this album with high expectations.I must say i was very dissapointed.I couldnt wait to get after hearing Kiss Your Ass Goobye and Street Music but unforuntley they are two of the only bright spots on the album.If i sing is a terrible song, he could of used any of his other diss songs about 50 instead of this one.And then critcizes 50 and then puts out One Name, which is laughable.I recommend that no one buy this album.Instead download the before mentioned bright spots."
3,Somewhat Watered Down {3 Stars},"On his second outing, Sheek Louch takes aim at the airwaves and his sound takes a hit because of it. Gone are most of the gritty, no nonsense thug anthems from his first LP. Those songs are replaced by radio friendly love songs that sound as cheesy as you might imagine. Sheek is at his best when he has 50 Cent in his crosshairs. Only then does Sheek return to his old form and covers his old topic range. Though the album is entertaining in spots, there are still a lot of noticeable holes in it. Guests include T.I., Ghostface Killah, Jadakiss, Styles P., Fabolous, Beanie Sigel, and Carl Thomas."
4,After taxes is a nice album,"After taxes is a good album from sheek louch, this album is a follow from the 2003 hit with wit me with sheek proves he has the best flow with pretty good songs, better lyrical content and better story.I Love song on this one, this is one of the best albums of this fall.Thumbs Up for Me."
3,(sigh),"I'm a big L.O.X fan, but I must say that Sheeks lyrical content is starting to bore me. Needless to say, he raps about the same things unlike his fellow L.O.X member Styles P. who has an array of topics he touches. Anyway...The production is so so, and my hip-hop collection would have been absolutely fine w/out this addition."
1,This D-Bum should kiss his ass goodbye,"This trash is just wack, it's no wonder this album flopped. Not to mention Sheek is a hypocrite. He dissed for 50 for singing(which he doesn't) yet I hear this clown singing the hook on Kiss Your Ass Goodbye. Every song on here sucks from that corny love song he made(One Name) to that stupid and weak G-Unit diss(Maybe If I Sing). I can now see why this crap sold 33,000 in the first week which is half of what his first album sold. Don't buy this or any other D-Bum album. Just wait till G-Unit exposes these idiots for what they are. We all know that 50 waits for low points in his enemies careers. Oh yeah, Jada and Styles are retiring. Next up is the D-Bum disaster Gay-Hood. These guys have always been wack and I never liked them, even before the beef with G-Unit. Go get that Get Rich or Die Tryin soundtrack instead of this watered down crud."
1,What's with that posture?,I'm no expert on every style but that posture on the front cover is enough to make me run a mile from this book!
1,Guided injury by Taijiquan?,"I only can run, too, seeing this posture. It's a shame what's sold under the title ""Official forms of Taijiquan"". PS: I have studied different forms of Taijiquan (Yang, Chen) and other martial arts in Taiwan for more than 10 years."
3,Just for fun,"Not truly educational, but the ponies are all very nice to eachother, which teaches some social skills and gives some fun girlie entertainment."
1,"""hee hee I'm just a girl""","This video has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.I love watching all sorts of cartoons with the kids, but not this DVD. There is no story, no laughs, no life lessons, and no entertainment value. Worst of all is the girls-just-wanna-have-fun attitude of the whole thing. I'm by no means a feminazi, but I find this video demeaning to little girls. It's like the writers decided, ""hey just throw pink ponies on the screen and add lots of giggling.""If you want your daughter to grow up with no ambition or interests other than giggling and the color pink, then this DVD is for you."
1,smashed dvd,"I am so dissapointed with the seller, However the last time that Amazon asked me for a review I got a hard time from the last lousy seller that I had bought something from! I will no longer buy a product from one of your vendors. If Amazon sells it directly than I will make the purchase. Please do not send me anymore requests for purchase reviews. Anne Marie metts"
4,Cute Movie,My daughter is very happy that she got this in her Easter basket. She loves ponies and she likes to watch this while having ALL her ponies surrounding her.
1,why dont,why dont you type in the karaoke songs so the poeple no what songs are on the cd or eles no one is going to buy it!
2,Stolen,Stolen: Certainly not up to here later writing. She is one of my favorite authors but not for this short story.
4,"Great documentaries of sacred places, cultures","This is a series of documentaries on various cultures and sacred places: Varanasi, India; the Taj Mahal; Haitian voodoo; Hinduism on Bali; Burma; Peru; Egypt; Jerusalem; Greece; Australian aboriginal tradition; the Anasazi ruins in the American Southwest; and Tantric Buddhism in Bhutan. They are each about 25 minutes long. They don't presuppose any knowledge of the religions they cover. But far more remarkably, they don't oversimplify and very rarely mislead or descend into shallow sentimentality. They maintain fairness to the traditions as well as historical accuracy without condescension. The ones on Burma, Haiti, Varanasi and Peru are especially good; Jerusalem and Egypt are perhaps a little weak. Few documentaries about religious topics would receive this high of a rating from me. These are genuinely good."
3,"Fixture is great, Bulb out with in 2 days","Previously I had purchased a few at local big name hardware store they all work great. The one I purchased on Amazon was only available in black; I would have liked the white housing like the others I purchased. I was careful not to touch the bulb when I installed it, but it only lasted 2 nights, lucky I had a spare bulb. Works fine now. Ordering and shipping was great!"
5,Easy to install and works like a champ,"I could do this review in one word ""flawless"". Not fancy, but a workhorse that does what it promises day after day. The photocell works perfectly, and if and when the bulb fails, it's easy to replace."
1,cooper MD70HB 70W HIGH PRESURE OUTDOOR LIGHT,Put it up yesterday and it worked for about 2 mi than would shut off then come back on fo a minute or two and off it goes again. I had to shut the power to it compleatly off and leave it off. When it goes off theres a crackling sound comming fron lamp. Wouldn't recomend this to anyone
1,"Weak hold, smells like silicone, horid texture.","Not nice to work into your hair. Runny, snotty texture, with liquid and gel separating.Could this be old stock from the seller or a by-product of the item freezing and thawing during shipping? I really dont know.But it appears to be a silicone based product and should give a weak hold. Should work good on short hair for creating relaxed spiked hairstlyes with a decent amount of clumping (of your hair.. not a bad thing). Being silicone based, it adds a bit of shine. Good for normal to dry hair types. Bad for oily hair."
4,Good product that is hard to find,"Hard to find a men's styling gel that is not too firm or stiff. The drugstores usually only carry stiffness ratings of8,9 or 10. This product replaces a less stiff discontinued product(Slick It) from another manufacturer.I would give this a 5 or 6 stiffness rating. Although I purchased this as a non-fragrance type it still doeshave a slight ""perfumey"" smell that seems to go away after application."
4,"Works, and doesn't make you smell like a girl","The place where I first bought this could no longer get any more because the manufacturer stopped selling to hair dressers. I liked the product because it works as a gel and doesn't leave a trail of girly, perfumey fragrance behind you. Had to order online once the store could no longer provide it locally."
4,Power90,"I purchased The Power90 dvd to be able to have cardio and stength training in one. It's a great work-out,the cardio portion is tough but doable and you're done before you know it! The strength portion is 28 minutes of weight training. Tony takes you through it quickly but you know you are working those muscles!! I recommend this to anyone wanting to get a good workout in the comfort of your home. No gym required to get a good work-out!Rose T"
4,Some Reviews are Reviewing a Different Product,"Some of the reviews here aren't reviewing the Power90 workout. Power90 has ONE DVD. Check Amazon's description of the product. It says there is ONE DVD. The DVD has: SCULPT Circuit 1-2, SWEAT Cardio 1-2 and AB RIPPER 100. That's it. I like this video, and am getting a lot out of it. But there is no fat burner DVD, and no Sculpt/Sweat versions 3-4, just the 1-2 versions. Fine with me. It's a good video."
3,I prefer Jillian Michael's titles.,"Tony Horton seems very male oriented. His banter kind of annoys me. He doesn't seem to have any method behind his workouts other than ""muscle confusion"", which seems like a fancy way of saying I do whatever because I don't have any science behind my routines. It's ok for a burn, but I think Jillian Michaels is a far better trainer."
2,not as good as it looks,"Though my criticism is going to hurt all the fans of this game but I must be honest. The game's good great graphics, enemies and surroundings. The designes and makers were brilliant and did produce an awesome game. Two bad things are that there are too many enemies (though I dont mind) coming to fight and sometimes the characters do not follow commands as I've spend 3 days bashing my head on the floor, now I've got a headache.Most of the time you try to attack but the characters take too long to follow and end up being stricken. Unlike Defiance it has camera angel problems as well as the ability to set your nerves on fire. I wouldnt recommend this to people who have anger management problem, short temper but I would recommend it for people who are mad about samurai games"
2,How could they have gone so wrong,"Well the fact is this is a game you shouldn't buy... unless you see it in a $5 bargain Bin, and only if your curious, but I'm tellin ya it's a waste of time. It looks good. Actually it looks great. I just can't for the life of me figure out how they could have screwed the camera up so bad. The fact is you have no control of the camera it zooms in and out on it's own, and moves to akward angles. This can be really frustrating ecpesially when your getting shot at by archers and the camera zooms in so you can't dodge. I got to the second level and never touched the game again. In fact I traded it for Resistance. It could easly have been a good launch title if they didn't ignore years of what other 3d action games could have taught them."
4,Great game but not complete,"If you have played Genji-1 on PS2, then you will be a bit disappointed in the way G2's gameplay was detailed. G1 had a unique reference to counterattacking and timing as G2 did not. If youre interested in playing the history, try it. If youre interested in samurais, try it. Its a great game with great concepts but left out a lot of specs from the first game"
1,Beautyful but not functional,After playing this game I wonder what the developers were thinking half the time. The graphics were great prolly some of the best I've ever seen. The game play could have been a lot better. For one thing it would be nice to know where your going half the time or to see the enemy behind you so you can prepare for an attack. The controls could be somewhat better. I move left and it goes slanted to the left or right. Aren't these guys supposed to be professional game developers.
4,It's exciting game!!!,This game is exciting and interesting. Also the story was good. I like this game. This game wasn't bored.
1,not good,This was one of the worst games I've ever played. For the first time in my life I sold the game because I couldn't stand the game.
1,WTF is this,"Whoa iam very surprised by this heaping pile of plastic. Get call of duty or something else. The graphics in this are very ps2 ish. Controls are good, sound is ok. I just dont think alot of time went into the game...it seems very rushed and incomplete"
2,"Played the demo once, deleted it","As other reviewers have mentioned, the camera is a big flaw. It's always at the same distance and angle, so it's really easy to get into a position where you can't see your enemies. Enough past games have gotten this right that I think this is an inexcusable flaw.I also found it hard to aim, and the demo didn't give much explanation of the controls so combos were just a matter of random luck. After dying near the end of the second level, which is the end of the demo, I was completely unmotivated to try again."
1,Charged me for 2!!! Don't purchase from these guys!!,"I only wanted one. However, I was charged for two and never given a refund. My lawyers are currently working on this case, but beware of these guys."
5,Lousy shipping..,"Don't get me wrong, the product is a good one. That's why I wanted it. After researching a variety of similar products and companies I felt good about this equipment and it's price. HOWEVER, I received it damaged from the shipping process TWICE! The plastic collars that fit into the cast iron legs need to be better protected so they don't break in transit. An ounce of pretection.. you know. It's a shame, I really wanted that equipment, but I'm not going to pay for it broken."
1,Missing Parts. Poor Customer Service.,"Received the unit almost 3 weeks ago. It's missing a critical piece. So I've got this useless half-assembled unit taking up space in my house. I've called Powertec multiple times and they assure me they will get back to me and keep me informed of the status via email and telephone. They don't follow up as promised. First they tell me they should have the part in stock in about 1 week. That was 2 weeks ago. Now they are saying 4 to 6 weeks. They told me to go to home depot and look for something I can use as a replacement part. WTF? I ask them why they can't just pull a piece from another unit and send it to me. Same ol' BS. Now I've got a heavy, bulky, useless piece of junk that I'm probably better off selling for scrap value. If you like to gamble, then check out Powertec. You may or may not get a complete set of parts.Update: 2 months later. Still no replacement part. Still no returned calls or emails. I hope this company fails miserably."
3,Stained Glass Kaleidoscope. (DVD),Interesting and educational video to spend enterteining moments realizing the works that they propose. Very advisable.
4,Great,This is an excellent book to have for collectors. You shouldn't purchase unless you are a serious collector.
4,Not bad at all -- It is simple and quick,"I really like the pimsleur approach to learning: they repeat things at the right time. Kinda weird, they say thing backwards so you learn it better -- and it works. Some method they patened.I'm not too familiar with Arabic at all and this CD set (4 of them) helped me with a decent pronounciation basis, basic vocab, yadda yadda....Also keep in mind that I've never bought Pimsleur's $300 dollar learning lessons (or whatever high price they charge) so I can't compare it to those.Definetly worth the $15 I payed."
2,Another Dissappointment,"I was very dissappointed after completing Pimsluer's ""Quick and Simple Egyptian Arabic."" The set includes 4 compact disks with 8 30-minute lessons. However, about 10 minutes of each lesson is a review of the previous lesson with a couple of new words introduced. Review is always good, and it's the only way to learn a language, but couldn't one just rewind the tape? I feel like I only learned about 10 words. In truth, I probably learned about 60, so that works out to about 33 cents per word since I paid $20.00 for it. The disks don't teach anything about grammar, tenses, and writing, of course. I don't even feel like I've sratched the surface of the language. Perhaps I should have purchased the Egyptian Arabic I audio, but it is extremely expensive. In short, if you are looking to learn Arabic, I'm sure you could find something less expensive and more worth your time."
5,Pimsleur Egyptian Arabic 4 CD's,A highly recommended tool for learning Egyptian Arabic! I am definately going to invest on the next set of lessons. It's very easy to follow and learn with the Pimsleur sytem.It would be nice to see what they could do as far as learning how to read and write it as well. That would be something I would also be interested in!I am very pleased with this purchase!
5,Pimsleur egyptian arabic,"Like they say on the CD box it's Quick and easy and it is. It's the best I have seen, I might do the full program."
1,POS,"What a rip off! I should have known better than to buy a used valve, but this POS didn't even include a solenoid! At least the box made a decent pooper scooper."
5,Great Rain Bird Quality,I installed 4 of these in my yard 6 months ago.All are working great.These valves are simple to install and to operate.
5,Disney's Art of Animation: From Mickey Mouse to Hercules,This book is excellent. It is also very different from the 1st edition in 1992 which featured Beauty and the Beast. About 50% of the book is all new from the previous edition and it's really worth owning both versions. Gives you much insight into the making of Hercules and in '92 edition into Beauty and the Beast. Great pictures and lots of good information in a very entertaining format. All ages in our family enjoy the book from 4 years old on up. You will too. I Wonder when the next edition will come out?
1,"Same Old, Same Old","Many of the names given in this book are fee-charging agencies. For the uninitiated or new writer, this is NOT where you want to take your work. You would do better to stick with established books on literary agents, such as those published by Prima or F&W Publications. Literary Marketplace is also an excellent reference guide; most of these can be found in the reference section of any library. Don't buy an expensive book that will by hyped as out-of-date the following year when the very same information is available free of charge."
2,Looks great but too loud to have on,"Got the Westinghouse Comet installed today just in time for an Arizona summer. To my disappointment the fan is too loud to keep on if you don't want a headache. Sad thing is that I bought a cheaper Hampton Bay for the other room and it's perfect. I'm not sure if it's Westinghouse or just this model, but I'm now going to have to replace it. Ugh!"
1,Terrible,"This product was nothing like described. It is not marble or black, this fan is maple colored with white blades on the reverse. It looks cheap and of poor quality. Before you buy be sure you know the color is not as stated in the description!!!"
3,Not Sci-Fi but Witch World Fantasy,"The characters are out of Time Traders, but the story is pure Witch World. I read Norton from the time I was a small child but stopped when she went heavily into fantasy starting with Witch World. If you are a fantasy fan - read the book; if you are a si-fi fan - pass and keep looking."
2,What A Let-Dowh....,I'm a big Norton fan but this fell way short of her other novels in the Time Trader series. There was almost no action and it came toward the end of the book in one paragraph. The suspense wasn't very good either as the storyline seemed to be mired down in mindless prattle. The various creatures mentioned were not described enough for the reader to form a mental image of what they might look like. The storyline was also very sketchy and I just never seemed to grasp it's depth--if there was any. I was very surprised at how disappointing this book was. I read it on my Kindle 2 complete with a number of formatting errors.
3,A sequel to something,"It seems necessary to have read a previous book to fully appreciate this novel. The opening chapters make continual references to previous action. The first half of the book develops the characters, and almost entirely deals with interactions between individuals in a group. The book starts out slow-paced and it was difficult to hold my interest. The team of individuals finally arrives on an alien planet in Chapter 11, their mission to travel back in time on the planet to attempt the rescue of another team that has disappeared in the past, discover the origin of artifacts, etc. The pace of the action picks up when they go back in time, and it becomes hard to put the book down as they unravel the mystery of the planet and determine the fate of the missing team. They also encouter the paradox of time travel, i.e., some things exist in the present because time travelers from the present visited the past to create what is found in the present."
1,Tribute To Tha Goddz,"Limp Bizkit,da greatest band in da world,deserve a tribute.They never sold out,and neva plan on sellin-out.Deez people really covered tha awesome genius,betta know az Fred Durst,songz very well.Get dis cd honorin' tha goddz of metal.I would have given dis more starz,but tha Durst iz no where 2 b found on dis record,so one is good 4 now.Peace."
5,Another great workout by an excellent instructor,"The DVD is well produced and has once again got Karen's excellent cuing and great form. Yes, you do need the foam roller for this workout, but it is a really well worth investment, as Karen shows a lot of different ways of incorporating it into her workout. I especially like the 20 minute preprogrammed options for days when time is tight or when you might like to add sections on to other workouts. The cardio is fun and the toning effective but not too exhausting especially for people like me ,who work out a lot. I want to feel energized after a workout , not completely wiped-out."
3,Good for light days,"Karen Voight: The Complete Sleek WorkoutA bit of cardio, a bit of strenght (light dumbells, few repetitions),workout for the whole body but not for advanced exercisers. This is for when you are already sore from another workout and need to go lightely on your body. Karen's posture is excellent. I liked the production and the option of doing everything (cardio+strenght+abs+core/back+stretch) in one 50min workout or separately."
4,Good to have in your collection,"I've had this DVD for 2 years now and yes I'm still using it. It's not explosive high-intensity workout but i think designed to warm you up and dig deep into those muscles and work on strength building. I used parts of this DVD in my pregnancy (adjusting the movements and exercises) and since having my baby it has been excellent for strengthening everything up again. You do need the foam roller and you can adjust the weights. I like Karen and would buy more of her DVDs. So, good for those low intensity or low energy days but when you still want to feel like you've workedout."
3,Just okay,"I love Karen Voight, but this one is just so-so. I have used her DVDs for more than 10 years. I like how organized she is, and she doesn't have an annoying voice (Denise Austin, hello?). The music on this is dated and it doesn't have any real new routines. Once you've been doing her work-outs, you see similarities in almost all her dvds. I love her Power Yoga and Streamline Fitness DVDs. Much better than this one."
5,It's a hit!,We bought this little chair for my son's guinea pig. It's roomy and she gets so comfortable lounging on it. I washed it once already in a front load washing machine and it came out just fine. I'm not sure how it would do with a top-load machine though. Well made too. Definitely worth the price.
1,Valley of Decision - Archives Collection,"This is a wonderful movie so I was so anxious to purchase it. It is too bad it was not restored in any way because the presentation is awful. The sound was terrible - many times the music totally overpowered the spoken lines. I was so disappointed! This was the first and last time I will ever buy an Archives Collection. These are only transferred when ordered. What a terrible idea. This film deserves to be restored, remastered and with closed captioning! It is a marvelous story and I love Gregory Peck and Greer Garson. The 1 star is for the DVD, the movie itself deserves 5 stars!"
5,Wonderful movie...adding to my list of favorites!,"I caught this movie recently on TCM, and it is a true gem. I became a Greer Garson fan about 10 yrs ago in high school when we watched Madame Curie during a chemistry class. I was impressed with her acting and followed that up with Mrs. Miniver, Pride and Prejudice (bonus for having Sir Olivier), Random Harvest, etc. She had such talent and was such a beauty.She was equally lovely in this. She and a really young Gregory Peck (so handsome and a great talent) had wonderfully palpable chemistry with each other. The supporting characters, including Lionel Barrymore and Jessica Tandy(!!), were excellent in their roles as well. This story had humor, tragedy, love, sadness, joy...just a wonderful film to behold. I stayed up late finishing it bc I had to know what happened at the end. The ending might surprise you! (that's not a spoiler, btw). I can't say enough good things about this movie.I plan on reading the book now, and of course, purchasing the dvd!"
4,Great ambiance music,"I listened to this CD at the San Diego, Courtyard Hotel. It was playiung in my room and it was a great ambience CD.This CD has a great sampling of acoustic artists and is great listening over a glass of wine and creates a relaxed atmosphere for just chilling out.If you're looking for some great acoustic guitar music, this CD would be a good purchase."
3,An accurate account of Western history and Colorado ranching,"A well written book that tells of the rich Indian, mining and ranching history of Colorado's San Luis Valley, based on historic documents, photos and stories handed down four and five generations. It also tells a story about Mel Coleman, a fourth-generation rancher who litterally bet the ranch on the growth and popularity of natural foods, and WON!"
2,NOT an Ethernet/Phone Combo,"Although this item is advertised as an ethernet/phone combo device, it is not. It is simply a retractable phone cord with an RJ-11 (phone)connector. It performs just fine in this capacity, but look elsewhere if you want to purchase an ""all in one"" gizmo. This won't do it for you as there is no way to use this baby to get on your LAN"
5,Hilarious - Top comedy to enlighten the heart,"Best performance I've ever seen from our famous Maggie Smith, to immerse yourself in this movie is sure to cure anyones malady. At first a frown may appear on your brow, but once you understand the characters (especially 'Augusta' - Maggie) the true colours of fantasy, comedy AND reality where some are concerned - just shine through. I cannot understand how this movie has never really had the publicity it deserves, get your wallets out and buy a copy immediately. I'm about as selective as one can be when it comes to comedy's, particularly from the '70's but this is one you cant let go."
4,Laugh a lot,I am a big fan of Maggie Smiths and saw this film years ago. It 's memory stuck in my head and now I happily own it and can watch it as often as I like.
4,Matt S,Lighthearted and very witty. We don't see enough of Alec McCowen in films. This film demonstrates his great acting skills. A huge dose of classic British eccentricity!
3,The Book is Better,The book by Graham Greene is charming and beautifully written. The film is totally different. There are episodes in the film that are not in the book and it is not nearly as subtle and charming as the book. Maggie Smith is worth seeing (though she does overact some) but the film was a disappointment. I purchased the film at Amazon because it is not easily available elsewhere.
1,Disappointing,"We had fond memories of this movie when we first saw it on it's release. For us, it turned out to be one of those great memories best left in the past! Wonderful costumes, and great settings did nothing to save this for us, and the wonderful Maggie Smith over-acted like mad; probably highlighted by the fact that her supporting cast, to a man, was unspeakably boring. Her 'old lady' make-up was a tad scary also. Visually the restoration was excellent, but the sound quality was very poor."
5,An excellent way to get started with Visual InterDev 6,"This book will provide you with a fast way to get up and going in Visual Interdev. Coverage of the basics of DTCs is excellent. VID has a lot of breadth and requires knowledge of ASP, which you will be better equipped to understand after you read this book. After reading this book I found the on-line ASP docs from Microsoft sufficient. Mr. Amundsen's book provides some very nice information on ADO. You get information on using it both at a low-level and using DTCs. Learn the low-level approach first and the DTCs will make much more sense. The author supports a mailing list and web site with some great tutorials and a FAQ area. The list and site with the author's support constitute a great resource for learning the more advanced topics."
1,Not worth it,"The good reviews here on Amazon helped me make this book my choice. Sorry to say it hasn't gone so well. The first few chapters are ok (I learned a lot), and the writing style is fine for me, but the errors make it frustrating to use. I started by writing down the errors that leave you wondering ""Did I do something wrong, or is this another error in the text?"", and stopped after 8th one. I don't think the best way to learn is to constantly correct errors in your textbook. The last straw for me was the database chapters. The book does not come with a CD-ROM with the examples.. The database chapters reference sample databases to learn by, but without the sample databases from the website, the chapters are very difficult to learn anything from. I'm cutting my losses, and beginning my search for another Interdev book. I recommend you learn from my experience and don't repeat my [mistake]."
1,Only for absolute web beginners :o(,"After all the nice reviews this book got, I was looking forward to ""read and learn""....BUT I was dissapointed. If you now the basics of HTML and VBScript, you can skip the first 400 pages. After them Amundsen does every lesson in way ""you are a student and therefore stupid""-way. I dont see any relavance in telling people how to add a ASP page to their project in EVERY lesson. Some of the lesson doesn't work the way he said it would, he doesn't cover servervariables very good, he ""cheats"" in some of the lessons (not writing what he ACTUALLY did to get to the result), it's almost impossible to get the ""downloadables"" from the support website and his coverage of Active X Documents in connection with VID is VERY skinny. I think that I would recommend this book to VisualBasic programmers going for the web or absolute webbeginners, but thats about it."
2,short on detail specific to Visual InterDev.,"This book is short on contect about many aspects of Visual Interdev, but has filler chapters on SQL Server administration etc. Does not even show the properties of most of the design time controls that ship with InterDev 6"
1,A total disappointment,"We ordered the book to learn using VID, what we learned was how not to write a sensible book. With this book you'll learn how to open, close a file, etc, but not much about building ASP pages. For example, there are only 3-4 lines written about Form Manager. Don't buy it, if you can find a good book on VID 6."
2,Get a different book.,"When I bought this book, I realized that it was for beginners. That was what I was looking for. But this book assumes you're retarted. Every example starts by telling you how to open a New Project. After doing it 10 times, you don't realy have to be told, Click on File, then New Project, then name the project.Also, the database section is far to vag to be of use. One of the most importand aspects of InterDev is its Database abilities. Unfortinatly, there is only a few chapters on how it works. I also had problems getting some of the examples to work.If you are a complete beginner, with no widows experience, this is the book for you. If not, then I would suggest a different book."
2,Lots of Errors.,I have personally worked thru more than half of the book and have been totally frustrated with the number of Errors. The DB chapters (16-17) simply are wrong. It took many hours to debug his instructions
4,Great resource!,"I would give it 5 stars, but some of the resources/suggestions are outdated. But that's to be expected considering the book is 20 years old. Wish she would do an updated version!"
5,Sew to Success Great Book,This is a great book. It was written a long time ago so some of the things don't really apply like pricing based on local sales.. because now we can sell over the internet. But what a great book and eye opening to the different ways you can offer your sewing services.
5,Excellent!,This is a small book that is very informative and doesn't take hours to read. I loved it! I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to start their own home sewing business. Thanks Kathy for writing such a wonderful book!
5,Excellent watch,I bought this watch for my fiance. He loves unique jewelry and he loved this watch. The picture does not do this watch justice. The way the light hits it is spectacular!! I am very happy with the purchase.
5,great watch,"I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. The styling is very unique and different, just what he wanted. To say he was surprised is putting it mildly. The watch arrived on time and in perfect condition."
1,Disappointed,"I am disappointed in how Paramount has released this DVD. While the art on the box is nice and that we get the following episodes A Chipmunk Valentine, Simon and Dr Heartthrob, Theodore and Juliet, and Dear Diary. Here are the following problems that I found with it.A Chipmunk Valentine is in Mono sound and the sound is slower then when it was broadcast originally.. Another problem I found with this DVD is in the Theodore and Juliet cartoon. The song ,Love Potion #9, was replaced with the Witch Doctor. Those that own the original valentine video will know what I'm talking about. I think that it's sad when Bagdasarian productions alters it's own works... I am so tired of music replacements for shows that involve covers. The witch Doctor song does not fit this cartoon IMOO... I just wish that the cartoons were left intact... I thought that DVD was meant to preserve shows... This longtime fan is leftt feeling disappointed...."
4,It's about time!,"I dimly remembered the Valentine special from childhood. When I first saw Tuxedo Mask on Sailor Moon, his attire reminded me of Alvin's Don Juan getup, but I wasn't entirely certain it wasn't all in my head. I'd looked and looked for the Chipmunk Valentine special, and when I finally saw it in a store the other day I couldn't snap the only copy up fast enough!It's been years since I watched Chipmunks, and I'm a bit startled by the cheesiness of the show, but these episodes are funny and lighthearted. The first episode is especially charming, as we see a world full of hearts in honor of the holiday. I recommend the DVD!"
5,Great as Always,"As always, Alvin and the Chipmunks are as entertaining as ever. The whole family loved them."
3,Good chipmunk & Alvin love fest,"I have always loved Alvin & The Chipmunks, but my interest began long ago in the comics before the animated cartoons. They do manage to fill their episodes with familiar or new music just for the occassions they are celebrating, and watching them does remind you of the comic style characters which is also an added plus. I just can't get over listening to helium sounding voices for long periods of time. Just like Peanuts, Alvin & his friends seem to live in a world nearly uninhabited by adults and mature voices to offset the continuous chipmunk voices. That is my only concern about the cartoon series, but Dave does appear quite a bit in the scary Halloween cartoons more than the Valentine specials."
2,not keepsake...,"this cd is balls...they got rid of their bass player. also there isn't any hint of hardcore... they have definitely sold out. some of the lyrics in the CD go something like...""a nightmare for you, a goldrush for me..."". All together I bought this CD hoping to get some good hardcore/emo but I get an album of almost what is pop punk. blah. and just to add the keepsake song on pop goes punk is balls."
1,A disgrace,"This is a disgusting tribute, filled with excellent Tool songs, that were brutally destroyed by the ""artists"" that performed the on this CD. I am a huge fan of Tool, and have every CD that they did, or was about them which includes this monstrosity. To start, the vocals were horrid, I am not sexist, but women cannot sing Tool (ex. Stinkfist), and techno bands should not even try (ex. Disgustipated and Reflection). The vocals on every song were just wrong, no one can match Maynard's strong vocals, and the bands sound. If you want to buy a good CD, get the string tribute to Tool. Now that is a good CD."
2,Well...,"I understand that Tool is about being open-minded and seeing things in another way, but that does not mean we can't have an opinion about the album. If you're looking for a very cool album to put in your cd player and sit back, this is not the right one. Some of the songs are impossible to recognize and some of them (specially Aenema) made me laugh. But if you're a Tool fan or you'd like to hear their songs in a different way, then you should get it, even if just to understand both sides of the discussion."
1,nothing like i hoped,"went to bestbuy and picked this up, being a huge tool fan i thought this would be interesting.. and i guess some may describe me as a tool 'purist' of sorts, and well,some things that might have made this album better, is #1 use singers with good vocal range, instead of useing voice modulators and singing in a rather monotone way. #2 don't use crazy distortions/sounds, that only distracts the listener from the actual music. #3 it doesn't have to sound like tool to be a cover, but it has to sound good. #4 having some talent doesn't hurt either. (some of the intros sounded good, but bought the farm a few seconds later) the way reflection sounded, it lost all of it's magical qualites. and though i admire the courage of these bands taking on these songs, it just didn't sound right to me. The lack of emotion and passion behind the singers kind of disturbed me. overall my recomdation is, don't waste your money."
1,Slap in the Face,"I've been a TOOL fan since the beginning. This album is a mockery of TOOL's genius. They have twisted the songs to turn them into some sort of techno crap which is the exact opposite of TOOL. If you are a true fan of TOOL, DO NOT buy this album."
2,bland,I don't usually write reviews but i bought these and was disappointed with the flavor. The chocolate was too mild and the peppermint part a little bland. I prefer the kind they sell at Williams Sonoma...
2,An American-centric and partial book,"The book is often openly biased, and it fails to confront impartially different opinions on the topics of discussion. It also suffers from a lack of cultural relativism as it takes the American-centric point of view for granted.The volume does not offer a reflection of possible American wrong-doing, but tends to defend it. As a result, anti-Americanism is too often considered as static, unjustified and illegitimate without analysing it as a relevant critique of American foreign-policy attitudes.The book poorly analyses the sources and reasons for anti-Americanism and its trend in relation to US foreign policy decisions. Having analysed how US actions have resulted in increased anti-Americanism, the book could have provided a stronger evaluation of American foreign policy and would eventually offer a lesson for a more multilateral, law-based, balanced and pacifist US foreign-policy strategy."
4,A NICE STOCKING STUFFER FOR BEGINNERS,"i don't really see any theme for this discother than a brief sampler of willie's rcayears, or just another repackaging that maycontain a song a fan may be looking for. forme it was the second. i finally got ""every body'stalking"" on cd but minus the strings found onthe ""sweet memories"" lp.when i found the""sweet memories"" cd i snatched it right upin a hurry to get get it home and listen.guess what? the cd version was missing""everybody's talking"" as well as twoother songs. oooooooooooooh THANK you rca.this is the same ""everybodys talking"" but adifferent mix: two acoustic guitars,bass& bongos. the bongos REALLY stand out inthis sparse mix so i made a dub of justthe right channel on to another cd.bongos gone, i'm happy. rca releasedso many different mixes of the samerecordings, this disc just may havesomething you're looking for!"
2,Tends to break hair,"I have had this model for a couple of years.Positive:- It does a great job on underarms.- The fact that the unit is rechargeable is a big +.Negative:- It tends to break hair instead of pulling it with root and all, so hair grows back faster than it should.- The depilating head is slightly curved, which makes it less efficient on flat surfaces and depending on the orientation of the hair, impossible to use. I really have to press it down on some areas, just that so it grabs something.- You'll have to run it over the skin several time for it to get all hair."
3,good,"probably is a good product, but in the specification didn't mentioned some import ants information to consider before we buy it. Like that the diabetes can use it"
3,Not the best one,"I have no problem with waxing or with epilator. yes, it hurts. it doesn't hurt THAT much. both waxing and epilation are the same to me. the only problem i found with that product, is that cordless became corded way too fast for my liking. now, i need to look for a different product and hope that the battery will hold a little longer than it worked with that product."
1,Emjoi = JUNK,"Dont' waste your time and money on Emjoi products.Our epilator purchases have lasted a maximum of 6 months, with an average of 3 months. Emjoi proves to be a poor investment, a poor value. Repair service and customer service are rude and useless.Emjoi = JUNK."
4,Pretty decent,"With animation just below that of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, this movie looks simply beautiful. The story is decent with some flaws, but nothing major or anything detracts from the experience. The creators of the movie have been in the business for over 20 years, making over 200 a year with many for Warner Brothers and Disney. I look forward to owning this on DVD."
1,Please tell me this isn't a real book,"Tell me it's some kind of sick joke that someone is making. Tell me that such a disgusting, sexist book never got published. Somebody. Anybody."
1,I don't get it,Very strange that sexual mutilation is considered humor these days. I suppose I am one of those people who does not LIKE TO LAUGH.
5,The Gray's Anatomy of Classical Architecture,"This is a brilliant book. Derek Brentnall's illustrations are superb. What makes this book a joy is that it really opens a world for anyone who wants to know more about why so many of our banks, office buildings, schools and halls of government look the way they do. And it really gets detailed - not in an overwhelming or pedantic way - but in a fun, informative and artful style that calls out the venerable ghosts of our classical past for a festival of discovery."
4,The Norliss Tapes,"If I really have to think about it,this was a movie I had seen years ago. For some actors and actresses, you just like them, period. Roy Thinnis starred in a ABC TV series, also a while back called ""The Invaders"" which was a Quinn Martin production. The producer Dan Curtis,(who also did ""Dark Shadows"" an ABC weekday afternoon horror series, from 4:00-4:30. The series ran for 5 years from 1966-1971),and his assistant Robert Colbert, (he did the music for ""Dark Shadowsw"",""The Norliss Tapes"", and a movie also a while back called ""Burnt Offerings"", also produced by Dan Curtis. ""The Norliss Tapes"" dealt with the supernatural, which I have always been fascinated with. I'll admit the ending of ""The Norliss Tapes"" leaves you wondering what happened to David Norliss? But still, all in all, I liked the movie just the same. Isn't that just like the supernatural? and in real life? Certain things can't be explained."
3,Good effort>>>,"I was surprised. I really liked this. If you like Kolchak: The Night Stalker series, you'll probably like this. Be forewarned, the ending may not satisfy most people. It's very obvious that this was a pilot.Despite this, I liked it and the ending. I like Thines as well."
5,The norliss tape(tv movie) DVD,This is a good DVD to have if you are a acifi fan. The review of this TV movie is poor too because it compared itself to KOlchalk the NIght Stalker TV movie.
4,From the past,"I was glad to see this movie released on DVD as it had been years since ithad terrified me late at night. Alas, as a 30+ year old made for TV movie,it just didn't pack the same fear as viewers are now used to as this type of movie genre has exploded in the last 15-20 years. Everyone this has been loaned to has enjoyed it though."
5,Excelente de Principio a Fin,"De la Mano de Dan Curtis, Llega este film de Thriller y Terror.David Norliss (Roy Thinnes) es un detective que es contratado por Ellen Sterns (Angie Dickinson) para invertigar extraños sucesos dentro de su mansion tras la muerte de su esposo, un excentrico millonario que se dedicaba a coleccionar arte antigua y oscura.Lo que ellos no sospechan es que este es el inicio de la lucha contra las fuerzas oscuras de un antiguo dios, Sargoth, al cual intentan resucitar; deberan a toda costa impedir su retorno.Episodio Piloto de una serie que nunca fue continuada, para muchos una joya del Cine de terror de los 70's; particularmente excelente desde el punto de Vista del Cine fantastico y Terrorifico.Recomendada 100%, la pelicula tiene un ambiente oscuro durante todo el transcurso de esta y la actuacion esta a la altura del reparto."
1,So much for memories,"You know how sometimes you recall in your mind an old movie or show that you saw many, many years ago, and how great it seemed! Then you stumble across it on DVD and buy it..... Wow! Maybe this movie seemed great to me, when it was on TV, but now days, watching it, it SUCKED! Very boring and cheap effects... not scary at all, just a waste of my time."
3,Not one of Dan Curtis's Best Movies,"Well lets just that this movie was ""OK"" and thats it. It isn't one of Dan Curtis's best movies thats for sure. However, this movie is just that..average and sometimes dull. The vampire looks more like a ""zombie"" and any movie that needs narrating isn't that good. I guess the high rating made this ""high rated"" because it took so long to get it on DVD, but, other than that, its an average movie thats a rental..no more..no less."
5,Very Entertaining. Great role for Roy Thinnes and Angie Dickinson.,"A must have for fans of the Dan Curtis brand of story-telling. An eerie tale that should have spun-off into a regular series. Roy Thinnes is great as always and is ably supported by Don Porter, Claude Akins and Angie Dickinson. Superb print. Buy It!"
3,Te Diem,"If I may be permitted to speak oxymoronically, this book as it once indispensable and utterly useless. It is indispensable for the sheer wealth and weight of fact it carries. The book constitutes a veritable rhapsody of small details, collected without due regard for relevance and with every regard for hanging on the the myriad fruits of bibliophilia. How then is it useless?It is useless because it dispenses with the immense effort - at once imaginative and cognitive - of reconstructing the relationships and the world to which the work and activity of Yeats was a response and against which he defined himself. This task of reconstruction is never only a matter of painstaking factual excavation. It is a question of reimagining a whole ""field of force"" (Wittgenstein) into which, so to speak, the poet was ""thrown"". This bok is a heroic but antiquarian leviathan."
3,A bit flimsy for thick and long hair.,"I bought these clips for sectioning off my long, thick hair for styling (straightening, blow-drying, etc.). The clip hinges are nice and springy, but the overall clip is kind of flimsy -- not ""snappy"" or ""grabby."" This is excellent if you normally get your hair tangled or stuck in other clips, but I found that they like to slip right out of my hair. They have small ""teeth,"" more like ""texture nubs,"" for ""gripping,"" but this really didn't do anything for me. Still slipped right out of small, looped sections of dry hair.Also, the shape is somewhat odd... I wasn't expecting ""metal alligator clips,"" which pull and get stuck in my hair, but these are almost like old school banana clips from the '80s.To sum it up: A very gentle clip. Definitely not strong hold for styling, but won't tangle or pull your hair. For my purposes, it isn't strong enough."
2,Eh... not for hair with any kind of length or volume.,"I wouldnt say this product is terrible, but rather cheap.. My hair is pretty long though.. These clips do not hold well even for a minute or two.. Sections must be very small in order to work. I think next time I will just use metal ones.They DID arrive pretty fast though!"
1,Worse quality ever,I bought the Marianna jumbo section clips. The clips do not line up at top and bottom. I expect them to break right away. Makes no sense to pay to send them back. I also received all brown vs. three colors. Very unhappy customer. The one star is for simply receiving the clips.Marianna Jumbo Section Clips 3-pack
4,Does the job,"I am satisfied with these large clips. Keep in mind that they are quite large and wide, nearly six inches long, and more than twice the width of typical, skinny silver clips. Three of these clips should be enough to clip up the hair of nearly anyone - one for each side, and one for the back. They hold fairly well and release the hair without pulling the hair. The arch makes them comfortable against the scalp. No problems."
2,Received all black,"Do not get fooled by the picture on the item, I received the product and it was three black clips, not 1 black, 1 white and 1 pink as the picture shows.My 2 cents."
2,Not so great...,"I have thick, long hair and was hoping to find sectioning clips to put my hair up when I'm drying/straightening it. I thought these were supposed to have a strong spring, but when i put a section of my hair in it, it doesn't even close, and my hair slides out of the open end. Plastic seems kinda cheap and the springs are not strong at all. I would say these are not worth the price."
1,Poor Quality,I received these a few days ago and I'll be returning them immediately. The quality is terrible - the clips do not stay closed and the bottom part of the clip isn't even centered with the top part.
1,NOT HONEST,"THE PICTURE SHOWING 3 COLOURS ,WHICH IS BLACK- PINK - WHITE BUT WHEN I GOT IT COME WITH 2 COLOURS ONLY , 2 BLACKS AND 1 WHITE .TELL ME WHO'S WILL GOING TO BUY YOUR PRODUCT ANY MORE , NOT GOOD NOT GOOD"
2,Absolutely HUGE,"I knew they said jumbo but this is like the size of my head, I would not recommend this size."
4,Interesting but not the Best,"Natacha has a lot to offer, and I am pleased to see her exploring Latin American rythms in a more evident way. However I must admit that I really prefer to listen to her soothing and gifted voice in Middle Eastern drums. So Hayati Inta was a very nice addition to the collection. The hip hop with other singers is not my cup of tea, the only hip hopish song I actually have enjoyed is with 'El Tunisiano'; but all the others, including the ones in this CD are to 'young' for Natacha. I like her when she gets serious. It's ok, but look forward to more chabbi-like songs in the future."
2,"Natacha, no offense but I dont listen to you for hip hop!","Natacha, I love your voice and I am deeply disappointed every time your music veers into banal, incessant western pop culture! I give you two stars for track 8 & 10. The rest is not worth anything except to make me cringe because you have one of the greatest voices we will ever have the priviledge to hear! Imagine Leontyne Price singing Brittney Spears! I hate to sound pompous but give me a break ok? I hear this kind of stuff coming out of every club and car in the USA, can't I be a fan of your Arabic music and voice? What would you think if Beyonce did an album in Arabic?"
4,a fantastic journey,"Natacha Atlas has undoubtably one of the most alluring, beautiful, sensual vocal presences around. This album, at its best, has some nice contemporary flourishes while staying true and accentuating the feel of its arabic roots."
5,Journey Through Texas,The best word to describe this book: excellent. It is informative narrative coupled with humor. It depicts the life of the times in relation to different ethic enclaves and commmentaries regarding each area. The narrative is written in a smooth -flowing style that makes for easy reading on what might have otherwise been a potentially boring topic. Young Olmstead's ability to provide such a mature and perceptive perspective on his topics of choice allows us to see how this famous visionary could have envisioned and thereby formulated the most famous landscapes of the USA in later years.
4,mountain bike,"i was very surprised about the quality and easy installation of the bike,i like the most the disk brakes front and rear.with a discount of more than 40% it was a very good deal."
2,A very mixed bag.,"This collection is a potpourri of tales involving Jack with Captain Marvel, a jarring crossover that serves neither character well, and tales of the past which all lead to Jack's eventual journey to the stars. This book merely serves as a connecter to a more epic adventure and probably would have worked better if divided among the other collections. As it is the stories barely hold together and leaves you just waiting for the next journey."
3,"Good graphics, but a flat game","The game looks pretty good, though not even close to a game like Gears of War (xbox360). It has decent level design, but ultimately the game falls flat and feels rather dull. The art style is derivate and uninspired as well as the gameplay. In the few days that I've had my PS3 I've had more fun playing the motostorm demo than this game. Hopefully some better games will come out soon."
4,720p,"This is the #1 game for the PS3, and yet it only supports 720p and not 1080p. I want my money back. Actually, it still looks very good on my 37"" 1080p LCD and is pretty fun to play, especially online (up to 40 person games). The 720p is still weak though."
3,Most unimpressive,"I'm glad I bought this used for $30 shipped. I was expecting much much more, based on all these glowing reviews. This is my first PS3 title, coming from a 360 rig. After playing through about 6 levels, I am sad to say that this game does nothing much for me. My favs are Halo, Rainbow Vegas 1&2, Ghost Recon, Gears of War, Bioshock, Call of Duty 4, etc.. Other than the baddies jumping from side-to-side, avoiding your rounds, there's just not too much A.I. to work against. Maybe things will get more exciting as I move further into the game. Hope to find a better title so I can enjoy my new console more."
3,Not worth the price,"I bought this game after seeing all of the good reviews it got. I've since tried to find some reason other than lack of titles for the PS3 that would make this game more fun. If you played Halo before, you will have been spoiled by good AI. These enemies seem to be on rails like back in the pre-PS2 era of games. The only time I really get excited playing is when I get ambushed by groups of bad guys. I haven't been able to play online yet, so if you can you might enjoy this game more. Playing this game single player though, graphics and a couple interesting weapons are the strongest points in this game. Story, well, I feel it is like a Harry Turtledove novel, if that's what you like here you go."
4,Good FPS,I own both systems (360/PS3) and for the ps3 this is a good shooter now about $25-$30 new. Comparable to halo 3 but lacks the graphics of Uncharted and Gears of War. You assume the role of an American fighting an alien menace in England. Controls are very smooth and intuitive no tutorial needed. Resistance is now two years old but for the price you can't go wrong if you like keeping the world free from aliens.
5,My favorite FPS game,"Great game play, It's fast and really easy to learn, on the 1st stage you can get up to it.The story envolves you, its well planned and flows very nicely.Game play modes are quite vast, you can play Story mode alone, or Cooperative with a 2nd player offline only. Multiplayer offline goes up to 4 players while Online you can play with a lot, i mean a LOT of players...my favorite mode in this game is Capture the Flag.It has some unlockables and cheat inside game. Can't tell how many, but it has a lot...Its a must Buy for every PS3 owner...Over and out."
5,Way better than I thought it would be,"When I first saw this game in 2005, I thought it would be a load of garbage. Well a year has passed and I have really changed my mind about this game. The graphics are gorgeous, The sound is great, and the online modes are near perfect. My favorite game for my playstation collection."
5,This game is sick,"Ive never played a war game before this game is tight. Its like counter strike meets resident evil with a great story. It has really awesome graphics and the best weapons ive used in a first person shooter. Currently the only game I own for ps3 and Im confident its the best available for the time being. If you love action, suspense, and whole lot of options in game play definitley pick this up."
4,Good FPS,"It's no wonder this FPS game made it into the ""greatest hits"" list. For its marked down price and playability, it a good addition to your PS3 collection. I would recommend it to anyone who likes FPS games."
4,Get yourself surprised,"Pros: Appealing storyline, highly addictive, great graphics, gives you the feeling of a serious fps, gives you thrillsCons: Some weapons look like toys, gets frustrating sometimes, distance between checkpoints (saves) can be pretty long.This was my first PS3 games and I loved it!"
3,Its ok.,"If you've played Area 51 , Time Splitters or the Suffering , you'll feel right at home playing this game. The gameplay is very similar Area 51 as are the graphics and some of the enemies are very similar to The Suffering enemies. There's nothing really groundbreaking about this game , but there's nothing bad enough to drive you away from it either if you can get it for a decent price.In my opinion if you can get a copy for around $10 you should give it a try, any higher than that I'd give it a pass . If you've played many FPS's you won't find much new here ."
5,Lo Maximo!,este juego es simplemente lo mejor!! esta muy bien hecho y la trama es muy buena!! viene en casi todos los idiomas!! lo recomiendo!!! no es el que tenga las mejores graficas pero es lo mejor!!!see ya!
2,Resistance is just a mediocre game,So I finally got a ps3 off of craigslist for a good price and bought resistance off of amazon which shipped super fast as always. Right when I booted it up and saw the super ugly 90's style menu system I knew I was in for a dissapointment. The graphics are very subpar and the gameplay is just decent. It's still an ok game but just not what I was expecting since people were comparing it to halo3. Gears/halo3/cod4 all blow this game away and I really hate playing fps's with the ps3 controller after using the 360 controller. I'm really looking forward to little big planet though and hopefully that will make my new system purchase worth it.
2,"Repetitive, boring, nothing new","I guess I should not have bought this so soon after beating Biosphere. Got it for $19.99 so it is not a BIG loss. It has no depth and is pretty uninteresting after the first few hours of play. It rapidly becomes just ""same ol....same ol"".Can anyone recommend a FPS that really shows off the PS3???"
3,Now lets kill Aliens,"Well this game is good for people who ""thinks"" that aliens are bad foreign creatures who come to kill us all.After chinese people, japanese, rusians, and arabs.. now LETS KILL ALIENS. TAKE COVER E.T. you are next¡¡¡. thsi game has great graphics. great sound but is a TIPICAL FPS nothing new but GRAPHICS."
1,Could only stand it for 5 minutes,I bought this as part of the dual pack and Oh my god is this game terrible. I damn near fell asleep playing I just started shooting anything because it was that boring hopefully the resistance two i have yet to play is at least a little bit better... if not im getting my money back and putting it towards deus ex or something
1,why is this game 4.5 stars?,"I played resistance for 15 minutes at a motor cycle convention; i was glad when i was done. The game has a very simple, and narrow track feel. Dull enemies shoot and clamer at you as they try to eat you or something. So it was a surprise to me when I saw this game rated at four and a half stars, which is higher than both the rainbow vegas', as well as MW bad company. I like a lot of video games, but this one is not included in that roster. So why the high rating? why?I would give this game 2 or 3 stars but i thought i'd give it one to counteract the fallacy of this games quality."
2,Not That Fun,I thought it would be something like rainbow six games but the graffix were cartoony.Maybe fun for small kids.
3,Hilarious,"I usually agree with people on game reviews and id have to say your all overating this game FAR too much. All you hear when ps3 comes into conversation is resistance fall of man.So what is resistance fall of man?A combination of a ww2 game and Halo. yes halo, even have a gun that sounds like that stupid needler on halo.I guarentee you everyone who gave it good reviews is a halo fruit. Dont get me wrong its not a bad game its just totally overated by far. You play it once and thats it. The online play is just like halo except worse.I guarentee you , mark my words the next resistance that comes out you will be ""duel wielding"" more weapons ( Theres 1 wep i know you can duel wield in this game ) just like halo 2. Anyway the graphics are allright but considering no hdtv i cant see the full glory of it.And im being 100% honest when i say cod3 is better then this game. Yes online and offline, better."
5,Well done game,"Everything about this game is great, the gameplay, graphics, controls, story. I suggest not skipping this for Resistance 2... this can be considered a better game, and it's cheaper!There is a lot of variety in the guns and the landscapes, and the enemies have mild variety. It's a very good shooter."
5,Still holds up,"I just recently finished this game after leaving it on the shelf for so long, and I am amazed. It still holds up and I LOVE the 'old school' feel to it. Limited regenerated health, and you can hold more than the ""usual"" 2/3 weapons at a time. This game was enjoyable from start to finish. I love the story and the setting, and playing this game with myWireless Stereo Headsetcreated an absolute blast of an experience, really makes the sound stand out. For a launch PS3 title, meaning it's quite 'old' in today's rapidly evolving games, absolutely amazing. The end leaves you wanting more, and on that note... Time to continue withResistance 2."
4,alot of fun,this game is great it has coop and a great story my only complaints are that you have to toggle your sights and that you have to hold the crouch button to stay crouched
5,Awesome Game!,"When the PS3 first released in North America this was the hottest title out there. - and rightfully so! I still remember delving into this shooter for the first time after getting my PS3 as a belated Christmas present... I was sooo happy to have one of the first line of PS3's and I couldn't wait to test out the console's amazing new capabilities... But when I turned on Resistance: Fall of Man for the first time... HAHAHA! I was smitten! I loved the way you had to shake the controller when the aliens would latch on to you and the environmental effects where simply mind blowing at the time. I felt like I was a twelve year old on Christmas again... It brings back such fond memories. Sometimes I wish I hadn't sold it to GAMECROCK. - Coarse then I wouldn't have had the money to buy the brand new game Oblivion at the time so... Well, anyway... Oblivion was definitely worth the trade off but I still love this release title."
3,standard (but fun) shooter,"A totally solid first person shooter, but definitely doesn't offer anything new to the genre. Several times while playing through it I felt like I was playing Halo (imitation is the highest form of flattery?)The game is properly difficult on the Hard setting, and you really do need to think through some strategy to get through the more difficult battles. I enjoyed the combat thoroughly, although the plot and depth of gameplay left something to be desired. The graphics were great for their time but are looking slightly dated today (duh) and a real lack of realism in the gameplay is only slightly annoying (can't open many doors, can't really interact with environments).For the price nowadays, I recommend it."
3,Ok for an early next gen. game.,"Good graphics for it's time. Weak storyline, but awesome gameplay. Used the sixaxis controls for no reason though. All in all not a bad game, just an old game."
3,Hype machine,"Don't really see what all the hype is about this game. I mean, sure it's a decent first person shooter but don't see why some people think its the greatest game ever...."
4,"Solid, Intense, Fun FPS","Nothing really new here, but the funnest first person shooter since BLACK. The controls run so smoothly you don't even have to worry; they come as 2nd nature after a little while. The game(single player mode)reminds me of a sci-fi-ish Call of Duty, where most of the enemies look like Eddie from an Iron Maiden album cover. The graphics are very detailed; There are some truly crazy battle parts, a nice weapons variety, and some cool vehicle stuff(and I usually hate it when they put those into a FPS). And while I have seen most of what was in here before, it's hard to fault a game when they do it so well. Can't wait to see what the new Killzone is like..."
5,My Favorite Online Game,"40 player online, great graphics, awesome sound, good atmoshere, and killer battles. This game has it all in a wrapped of package of greatness, and it's worth getting a PS3. Best online game I have ever played. Buy it today."
5,The only good game in PS3,"It's a sad thing, but I must to say it: This is the only good game in PS3 until now. The weapon system is very fun, the nail grenades are one of the funniest weapons in the game. The environmental is awesome. The non-vibrating control is a shame, but the game design, weapon system and playability is so fun that you don't feel this absense.You won't find any new in this game, but it has all that you want in a FPS game. The multiplayer system is the best thing of the game."
5,Great FPS for the PS3,"I purchased this game when it first came out after reading some reviews about it. All I can say is I'm glad I bought it.The gameplay is great....Although can be challenging at times, try playing in superhuman mode :) Unlocked after beating game in hard mode.Graphics are not super detailed but are on par with most next gen games."
4,Great game to play with two people!,"This was one of the first games me and my husband got for our PS3, and it is by far the best FPS game I've ever played. The storyline is interesting, post WWII but no Germans just Aliens! I used to hate FPS, and was just an RPG fanatic, but I really had fun playing this game!The only bad thing about this game is that its really short. If you really wanted to you could finish it in a night. Also, you can only save one one player game and one two player game at a time or else it will save over your previous progress. But don't let that keep you from playing this game its really fun and I've played it over many times on a harder setting.I really give this game credit over all other FPS games I've played on the PS3, most others say they are ""two player"" but don't let you play with another person AND let go through the story (like rainbow six and ghost recon, you can only play levels you select with no story, or one on one, boring!)."
5,Very Fun Game,"This game was better than expected and I try to pick games apart because I always think they can be better. Although I do have a few issues, over all I thought this game was one of the most fun and surprising games I have played in a long while!"
4,Not bad but...,"As an avid PC gamer, I have a fairly high standard for video games. Clearly the PS3 possesses some serious horse-power and potential. Visually this game is on par with very high end PC games. In terms of actual gameplay its pretty average. I am pretty comfortable with a keyboard and mouse so adjusting to the PS3 controller for a first person shooter is a bit tricky but I don't blame Resistance: Fall of Man for that. The truth is that so far (granted I've only played the game for about an hour) I'm not particularly awestruck by this game.Any PC FPS enthusiast knows Half-Life 2 and BattleField 2 really are the state of the art and so far this game on the PS3 isn't in the same league.Good but not great."
2,Maybe this was fun when this was the only exclusive title for PS3,"This game straight up suuuuuuucks, I bought resistance 2 from a friend but I wanted to play the first game to get the full story before I went on Nathan Hale's second mission. But um this game sucks hard, I played about half way through and just put this game back on the shelf. Controls feel cheap, especially controlling vehicles, and the graphics suck suck suck. The only reason it gets two stars is because the story kind of kept me interested, and the AI is smart. I think I'll just wikipedia this story instead. PASS ON THIS GAME*Update: OK 5-2-10 I finally played the whole game through, still stand by my original review. The key here is that the AI is smart and the story is pretty cool, but at the end of the day it feels like a poor mans HALO."
3,not as good as I thought it would be,"After reading all of these reviews, I thought this game would be almost as good as the darkness. The darkness is the game I like most right now. Resistance is just ok game I think. The darkness you have to think when to use your powers and where and what powers. Resistance is just point and shoot. No thought."
3,"Decent game, but definitely NOT next-gen","I really expect LOTS more from my PS3 that the old COD-look! graphics look cartoonish. Gameplay is decent,but not outstanding. I want to have a serious threat for gears of war, not a beefed-up COD!"
1,what is this?,"luckily i don't feel too bad about this game, because i wasn't really looking to buy it, it came free with a new PS3 controller.i bought the two pack deal (controller and game all i wanted was the extra controller) at sam's club's for 37,99 USD. so i don't feel bad at all, gamestop sells a used PS3 controller for about 40 dollars so if anything i feel like i made a good purchase.now about the game.graphics are terrible.the story is ok but with the stupid interaction with the rest of your team, it is like being among idiots and all these idiots do is die in front of you. for example in the begining of the game, you have this Sargent who gives you a top of the line speech about being HOORAHHH and than poof him and the entire squad, seriously the entire squad dies in one tiny explosion. lmao....i am still trying to understand why this game has a 4.5 out of 5 and a 9 out of 10 rating.i would give it a 0 but amazon wont let me do so."
2,"PC players, stay away","I've been playing mostly first-person-shooters over the last 10 years, all on PC. I also play console games, but I never tried a console FPS before. I bought this game because of the rave reviews, and hoping that it would support a keyboard and a mouse. Well, that was a bad choice... The graphics are gorgeous and the plot is nice, but the controls are just too frustrating. Aiming with an analog stick is not only harder, it makes the character's movements unnatural. I feel like I'm playing Doom all over, with better graphics.I guess you get used to it after a few hours, but a mouse is just so much more intuitive and precise, and would make the experience so much more enjoyable.In my opinion, not being able to use a pointing device in a FPS is the biggest reason why consoles will still fail to capture a lot of PC players... This game is no different. So PC players, beware..."
1,This game sucks.,"It took me awhile to buy a PS3 - but when i finally did - i bought Resistance(big mistake), call of duty 4, metal gear solid 4 and assassin's creed.Man does this game suck. I hate it - It's just an overhyped Shooter. To me it does nothing special and it executes terribly. I don't see how this game has such good reviews. Maybe its the whole developent team that voted 5 stars for it.I can't even give you a full review cuz i stopped playing after about 45 minutes but i'm telling you this game sucks!!! Call of duty 4 was far far far better than this sorry piece of software called a ""next-gen"" shooter.I wish i could give it 0 Stars."
1,Terrible game....,"If you've played any of the Call Of Duty games, (or nearly any other first-person shooter out) this game just can't hang. The graphics are so..so.. and the game itself is about as much fun as watching a mouse on it's spinning wheel. I'd rate this game below 1 star if I could. What a dissapointment."
3,Good game.,Great PS3 game buy nothing compared to Gears Of War for Xbox 360. Campre the two and you will see why 360 is a better console..
1,Awful,I found this game to be a huge dissapointment. All I heard about was how good the game was and gettin it started everything was so repetitive. Not to mention I felt like I was playing on the ps2 with those graphics. Do not waste your money on this game
1,boring,"i think this game is highly overrated, its so dull and boring and the graphics are like ps1 status, give me a break, this game is garbage. im going to go play bioshock, peace."
3,Dissapointed,"i was expecting this to be a better game. the graphics are not that great. im not sure the word to use for this game, but i just did not like it. but i paid less than $10 for it so ill just hang onto it."
3,It was ok...,"I don't know, I just couldn't get into this game. Maybe if I got this game when it came out and was more involved with the online community I'd have a different view. I'm just more partial to COD:WaW for my fps."
3,PS3 and 360 Owner,"My setup is as follows:Sony Wega 36"" HDTV (tube) with 720p/1080i, ps3 using HDMI cable, yamaha 7.1 receiver with infinity 7.1 setup. 360 connected via component inputs.For a launch game this game is pretty good but compared to more refined second generation games it is just not all that fun. It is more of the same in my mind, nothing revolutionary. I would compare the graphics to that of the Call of Duty 2/3 line for the 360 but the environments seem a little more expansive. The frame rates stay high in the game and the controls are very responsive. They also seem to have good collision detection. I wish the environment was more destructive and to have a continuous gameplay like they 360 does with Gears of War, xbox with halo/halo 2. I believe the online will be fun but the lack of the PS3's in the market place and the overall cost will prevent me from playing with my friends like on do on the xbox/360 thus the lasting appeal of the game is lower."
2,an old throwback,I was interested in the game... wow... what a let down. Gave it to my grandson. Hopefully they won't come out with a update.
4,Not as impressive as I thought,"The graphics aren't as good as everyone say. But tha first wave of games for the playstation 3 are crappy. fortunately, there are very big titles coming out next summer. The only good games for the playstation 3 right now are fall of man and that one boxing game. My suggestion to buyers is to wait another 3 months."
3,Just Halo for the PS3,"This is just Halo for the PS3. The storyline is mildly intriguing, but you have to wait for later games in the series for it to be resolved. There are several plot holes: times when you're suddenly transported out of one unfinished situation into a new one that's been going for a while. This means that your ammo / health / supplies get reset every level, which would give you little reason to maintain those if you could only tell how much longer the level would be. I can't tell you how many times I quit before going through a door because I didn't have time for another fire fight, came back later to the previous checkpoint, fought back to the door and found out that going through the door triggered the level ending sequence. There were several scenes that looked like they were straight up copied from Halo."
4,Very entertaining,"Resistance is a shooter game which reminded me of Doom. Graphics and storyline are good. The game has a good progression, with every new chapter bringing new enemies that you have to figure out how to defeat. The game is expanded to included chapters where you drive tanks and machines from the enemy. It's not a hard game to beat, but it takes some time, so it's a good buy."
4,Best PS3 Launch title,"I'm not normally a fan of First-person shooters (FPS), but I enjoy Reistance. The graphics are wonderful (for a launch title) and the game does a fine job of building tension. You'll grow to dislike the enemies you'll encounter, but the story doesn't do a great job of making you care for the game's protagonists. Anyone who has played Insomniac's flagship game Ratchet and Clank will appreciate the creativity of the weapon design, although the large selection you'd expect isn't there. If you've got a PS3 console in it's early days, R:FOM is a must play."
4,Great 1st person shooter,"I won't do an in depth review because others have done that well. I will say I play a lot of 1st person shooter games and am a big Medal of Honor and Call of Duty fan. Resistance Fall of Man is a terrific game of that genre and I'm having a blast playing it. Personally, I still prefer the more realistic war games like MOH and COD but for me this is a close second. As this one is a bit older now, got it at a great price on Amazon. Plan to get Resistance 2 when I'm finished with this."
3,Good game. Fun. Typical FPS.,"Resistance seemed like a remake of Killzone with different enemies. Combat gets a bit repetitive as in most FPS. I waited til the price dropped because the game is not worth $60. I'll probably do the same with Resistance 2. It's a good game, great graphics, very simple gameplay, shoot 'em up, blow 'em up, don't die, and save the world. Storyline is worth getting into. Replayability is nonexistant and multiplayer is completely terrible compared to games like Call of Duty 4 and Battlefield."
5,Fantastic shooter,"Since I could'nt get a ps3 this year, I went over to my friend's house because he was one of the lucky ones who actually got his hands on it. So far he has Call of Duty 3, Madden 07, Fight Night Round 3, and Resistance Fall of Man. Resistance is by far the best game out of the entire bunch. Great graphics, excellent sound, and a multiplayer mode that will keep you playing till a sequel comes out. Best game so far for the ps3."
5,As far as compilations go...,"Any John Anderson compilation with the exception of ""You Can't Keep a Good Memory Down"" is a good compilation. I'm not particulary fond of the sequencing here (whoever put ""Solid Ground"" right next to ""My Kind of Crazy"" must've had an odd sense of humor) but overall, it's a good listen."
3,Nixon Tide Watch,"This seems to be a well made and good looking watch. Battery went dead right after receipt, and supplier offered to replace the watch, but they do not have any idea how old the batteries are. So I got a local jeweler to replace battery, and all is fine.Watch is heavy, and I wish it had a stop-watch feature."
2,Save your money!,"First let me say that I have only been using the Tarot for a couple months now. That was the main reason I bought this book. It was supposed to be a simplified way of reading the cards and in that respect it is. However, after using the single card method for a couple weeks I have come to the conclusion either I am doing something wrong or its all a wash. After reading everyone elses kudos I have to admit maybe to the former. But not one of the things that the cards have said have come to past. I always use the cards in the morning before I go to work while all is peaceful and quite in the house. My goal is to get an idea of how my day at work will go. This morning,for instance, I drew the Tower which fortells of tragic events. I almost called in sick!! However my day, not only at work, but in general has been great. Granted, I did take every precaution so as to not allow anything tragic to happen. So until I get better results from my reading I have to say. Save your money."
2,Good Beginner Book,This book is good for the beginner that feels unsure in their explaination of the Tarot. Tarot Made Easy takes the reader in a simplified way through all the possible ways of interpretation of the Tarot. This book focuses more on the art of fortune telling than the exploration of the personal soul journey that can be the Tarot.
1,As good as a Magic 8 Ball,"Anyone with at least a little experience in tarot knows that though the cards and positions themselves have suggested meanings you can not deduce one's subjective experience to a single sentence. Interpreting tarot is like interpreting dreams, something which can not be done without some basic knowledge of the internal situation. The beginning of the book is useful but everything else should be taken with a grain of salt."
5,The only one,"This book is so insightful and amazing!! It it the only book you will ever need. I had it before, and it got very used and started falling apart, so I had to order a new one. I've bought a few others, but this is the one I always go back to. And the interpretations are always right on the money!! You cannot go wrong with this book. It is a must-have for every tarot enthusiast."
2,Not very accurate,"I was recommened this book by a guy at our local metaphysics store, not becaue he was a tarot expert, but because he said a lot of people bought it. Now, I'm not a beginner, but I thought I would browse through it, in hopes of reading it and having it for my library, and I liked the idea that it has several headings for each card, such as Romance, Finance etc. Well, I read my tarot on a daily basis, so I compared a reading I had done for myself. I have to say that given my question, the descriptions in the book were way off base and in some cases exactly the opposite of what it should have been. My recommendation is to just compare a few of the cards you know and a question that you had in mind. I didn't buy the book, even at half price. This may be ok if you just like to do tarot as a parlor trick and don't take the tarot at all serious."
5,User Friendly,This is the best book for learning how to read the tarot and it is really good for helping you interpret your own readings. I recommend this for anyone starting out.The guidance that is offered is superior to anything that I've seen. Nancy Garen is very insightful and inspirational.
4,This guide is great for beginners.,"Tarot Made Easy is a good reference source for people who want to read their tarot cards for themselves and their friends. It provides some good spreads and key information about the cards. While no tarot book tells *everything*, this one is perfect for beginners."
2,very disappointed,"I bought this book used and found it to be very dry and too concrete for my taste. I did several readings and found that ""none"" of the the appropriate catagories related to my questions??.... Unlike the more esoteric texts such as ""tarot as a way of life, ""78 degrees of wisdom"" and the classic ""tarot and individuation"" I feel that this book does not challenge the reader to ""think"" and intuit for themselves. I ended up trading it in for another classic ""hallowquest, the arthurian tarot course""."
1,Utter Rubbish,"This book is for parlor games at parties. There is no help in a path suggestion and more than often is completely WRONG. Use only for a game, it places Tarot into a comic book status"
1,I think that the booked sucked. I wish I never bought it.,I didn't like this book because I thought that I could have found better information elsewhere. Books like these are a waste of time and money.
5,Tarot Made Easy,"I have been using this book for about 10 years now - it's turned shades and is literally falling apart in spots. But it has kept me on track during some of my most difficult decisions, and is much more accurate than half the money I have spent on readings from reputable psychics (that's a lot of money). GET THE BOOK!"
4,Good mix of environmentalism and religion,"Gottlieb does a fine job in this work of mixing environmentalism and spirituality, from several different religious perspectives. The author makes clear his Marxist leanings, but these do not seem to overly impact his work, which does a fine job analyzing the woes of our planet and how one can view them from religious viewpoints. He seems to take a slightly moral relativist viewpoint in assigning all religions equal weight, but this is also a positive in that it shows the support for the planet from numerous perspectives. A fine mix of anecdotes and statistics, science and faith, I recommend this book to anyone, regardless of their stance along the political spectrum."
1,Attachment Sucks,"This net sucks because attaching it to the goal is a real pisser. You can't easily attach it to the goal and remove it quickly. It came with plastic electrical wire fasteners, which are a permanent way to connect the net to the frame. You got to cut the plastic fasteners to remove the net when you want to take it down after a game or practice, which is very impractical and costly."
1,weaving history,Buy this book if you are into history of weaving and admire personalities and their philosophies. I was looking for more instruction on design and was disappointed.
4,Moisture Tester,"easy to use, low cost moisture meter. Works well at detecting moisture in drywall, concrete, insulation, stucco etc."
2,freezes!,"The product worked great at first, but after awhile it started freezing on me. If I took out the battery and put it back in it would fix, but now it just freezes on the main screen, or it will get to the music and not play anything. I've done everything I can think of, and even tried looking at the manual, with no luck. Spend the extra money, it's worth it!"
1,Malfunctioned; very disappointed,"We purchased this as a gift for my mother. We downloaded some of her favorite CDs and it was working okay. The next night, when we started to download another CD, the charge was gone. It would not recharged. While connected to the computer, it indicates that there is no longer anything stored on it.We will return it.If you purchase this item, you should purchase it from a source with an easy return policy."
2,doesn't fit standard headlights,"wow this was a long time ago, but i remember i had to send them back because they weren't the right size. i ended up getting the hella ones - the don't have the colored ring but at least they fit."
2,Mainly noise...,This album consists of mostly disharmonic atonalnoise. There is one nice polyrhythmic song.
4,The Magic Of Chilli,"Aside for the history of Illinois chili culture and its great chili cooks (the double ""ll"" spelling is unique to the Illinois region and fascinating) the book's added strong point is it listing of excellent pointers on cooking chili and getting into the chili cookoff game. I wish I had read Christine's book years ago. It would have saved me countless hours of frustation in contest chili cooking."
2,Just buy the book,"The software basically covers the SAME EXACT INFO as the book and 99.99% of the times its word for word the same. Why spend extra money ? Just get the book. Also, on my computer there were about 15 - 20 test questions where some html tags were not interpreted properly and were therefore indecipherable in some cases (I do know HTML). The book is great. Just get the book. The authors could have did a lot more with this concept, but sadly they didn't. I did pass the SCJP test and their book helped a lot."
4,"Funny, sexy, crazy special effects!!","This movie was as funny as they get. I only wish giantesses looked so good! This movie, though a B-rated movie, was not too bad. Fun to watch, a pleasure to own, this movie was a great dream come true!!"
3,"Corny, cheesy skin flick fun","""Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold"" takes an already cheesy original, ""Attack of the 50 foot Woman"" and makes it cheesier! But it does so in such an engagingly cornball manner that you can't help but smile even as you groan at the inane plot and low rent special effects.The cast are all from the ""golly, gosh"" school of acting. They know full well they won't be up for Oscars so they lay it on shamelessly. There's an affectionate parody of Hugh Hefner. In a cute touch Michelle Bauer, who has stripped in dozens of b-flicks, plays a fully clothed science researcher.Lead actress JJ North and her fellow ingenues are amply endowed but the nudity, toplessness actually, isn't raunchy. They're too busy hamming it up to heat it up. There's not all that much nudity in the film, so don't expect a flesh parade."
2,Big Let Down,"Movie takes too long to develop to what we all want to see. When it gets there, we find ourselves in a situation in which we are waiting for more, but, as a TV Guide review of the orinal movie said, ""The attack, such as it is, doesn't come until the last 5 minutes of the film.""Would have liked to have seen more interaction between GTS's and normals."
2,60 feet of bad film,"I recently purchased this film while looking for titles similar to the Attack of the 50 Foot Woman which I liked quite a bit. Please, if you are looking for any kind of actual special effects, look elsewhere. Obviously the makers did not find a 60 foot actress, they used blue screens and splicing. Believe me, the makers could not even line up the actors so they'd face each other. Admitedly, if you want to see three hot girls modeling with and without tops, this movie can do it, as long as you don't mind some pointless and frequent jumps into a scientist's lab. Again, I think this movie has fine actors and actresses, and even the acting is tolerable, but it just doesn't make the grade. Trust me as far as the shots, the 60 feet doesn't help one bit. So I sadly must rate this movie as a 1 for content, and as a 3 for girls."
4,'Attack Of The 60 Foot Centerfold' (New Concorde) Time: 84 min.,"Great to see a movie that,I myself have had a fantasy of ever since I was like maybe twelve years old. Better than HBO's remake of the '50's thriller 'Attack Of The Fifty Foot Woman' mostly because of the total nudity. Angel( J. J. North), a simply die-for gorgeous curvy blonde unknowingly overdoses on some concocted beauty-enhancing liquid. She soon wakes up realizing that she is now sixty feet tall. Problem is there are no clothes large enough to fit her, so she's forced to walk around in the buff. Most movie fans may not enjoy this, saying that it's just too weird for them to grasp. Most memorable scene is when one of the other three beauties, Betty (Tammy Parks) a revenge seeking rival of Angel's drinks some of the same liquid and the two girls are dressed in shrouds having a brawl in a city street. Great entertainment here, as far as I'm concerned. Recommended."
3,Babe-a-liscious!,"Normally I would give a disc with absolutely no extras (except for 3 trailers for other Corman movies) 2 stars but I gave it an extra one since the price is so right. J.J. North is a babe beyond belief in this ripoff...er uh, I mean tribute to 50's sci-fi flicks such as 50 Foot Woman. REALLY bad special effects mixed with mostly forced perspective shots make for a fun flick with cameos by other favorites of mine like Nikki Fritz and Michelle Bauer. The catfight between the two female giants through downtown LA is a hoot and gives us the best line from the movie: ""My God! Look at the size of those T*TS!!"""
2,Not much going on here,"Got this because I thought it would be a funny take on the orginal ""50' Woman"" movie but it's not. Only a few weak topless scenes, even though the models are gorgeous."
4,por que no pasaron esta peli en mexico?,"Bastante bueno el guion...super actuacion de Mariana Martin, lastima su distribucion solo en Sudamerica a pesar de actuacion de algunos Mexicanos."
5,Caresses. A love/hate story,"The city, restless, at night. A chain of eleven stories complete a circle, linked by characters with different relationships: couples, mother-daughter, friends, brother-sisters, young-old people, father-son, lovers, father-daughter, mother-son, who cannot manage to communicate through love, to caress. It is set in the present, at the end of this millennium. These are naked moments in which human beings show their most intense emotions, as well as their basest instincts, love/hate, but also love in its many forms. Despite proximity, people can be total strangers. They can talk without listening, listen without feeling and act without thinking. But there can also be a spark of hope, of communication, a few caresses. It's a very strong play."
5,Best Spiritual Book,"This is the best spiritual book I have ever read because it is about 'doing' rather than theorizing. God is a verb, not a noun. It takes the traditional 12 Steps and makes it applicable for everyone, even if you're not fortunate enough to be an alcoholic. That sounds odd, but if you speak to many recovering alcoholics, they thank their disease and their use of the 12 Steps for their awakening to a Spirit-infused universe."
5,Best of Both Worlds,Spirit vs Spirit! This is the definitive essay on living a free life! Don't whine--Just work the steps.
5,Wonderful view of Pio Nono's Papacy,"This book is a wonderful historical overview of the papacy of Bl. Pius IX. To say the least, it's intense - it proposes to give an vision of his papacy, as well as a defense of Pius' major accomplishments, all within a few pages. Also, he gives endless footnotes to back up all of his claims. A good insight to the life of a good and holy man."
5,"Lovely, and Badass","The book is like a diary. There's good days for Maggie and there are bad days for Maggie. I love this book. It just sucks that the book came to me in bad condition. And it said it was in excellent condition. So i got my money back, but overall. The book was fantastic."
3,Very pretty,"I really liked these earrings. However, i agree with one of the earlier reviews that I thought they would have been a little bigger."
2,Why don't I ever learn?,"When They say this earring is 1 1/2 inches long...that includes the part that goes through your ear. Even then, I'm not sure the earring is an inch long. They are TINY. Don't buy jewelry on amazon."
3,item is smaller then I expected,I thought item would be longer. I know it has measurements so make sure to thouroughly review them prior to purchasing. Because I did expect item to be longer and they are very small earings. And a bit pricey for the size of item
5,Precious!,My granddaughter's birthday was complete when she opened her new pair of earrings. She has not taken them off since she put them on. Her birthstone is Peridot and she specifically had been asking for dangly earrings. These absolutely filled the bill. Thank you.
1,These brown and crisp bags don't brown and they don't crisp,They simply don't work. I followed the directions exactly and found it's much simpler to just fry stuff up on the stove. They don't brown and they don't crisp anything I tried to cook.
5,Contempory honky-tonk at its best.,"I purchased this CD the Tuesday that it came out, and it has not left my side since. I love every song on it. Reno and Honky-Tonkin' Fool are my personal favorites. If you love REAL country music, don't let this CD pass you by."
3,Only looks!,"A very nice watch, it looks great! But unfortunatelly, that is all it has.It runs faster! It gains 30 seconds somewhere around every 24 hours, and that is totally unacceptable.Also display of the date is very small and is easily readable only from 1st to 9th of the month, you have to carefully look to read when there are two digits in they number of the day.If you don't mind that each week your watch is 3-4 minutes ahead, then buy it! It's a nice deal in this price range, but I am a little dissapointed with it."
5,A very good read,"This is a very good read. What is nice is that it is a bunch of short stories that you can put down a nd pick up at a later point. I have been to quite a few of the parks mentioned in this book, and have spoken to quite a few of the Park Rangers."
2,too human,"i like the book and author but it is not as good as 'Oh Ranger'. too realistic, stories of the dirty work and cleaning up after stupid travelers."
3,Disappointing,"Afraid that there is too little humor in this book. Seemed like the author was afraid to offend visitors to National Parks by relating tales of some of the really strange events and things said by Park visitors. Spent one summer myself in Yellowstone NP. Favorite line there was ""What time do they let the bears out? What time does the 11 o'clock horse back ride start?"""
2,Boring!,"I found this book boring (sorry all you reviewers who loved it!). I wanted to love it, I really did. But the acronyms that the writer made up were annoying, and I got tired of basically the same stories over and over. What I mean: stupid camper/boater/hiker/etc., ranger to the rescue, safety lesson. Rinse and repeat. I really wish I liked it, but I didn't."
2,Hey Ranger,"I hate telling the truth about this book because I think I would genuinely ""Like"" the author as a Man But,I was very dissapointed with ""Hey Ranger""...His described situations were far from Hilarious and only really approached mildly entertaining.There were very involved ""Build-up"" sections that left me with a ""where's the punch-line feeling"".Although he mentions some contemporary subjects I get the feel that he is describing ""turn of the century"" history.He could've used a good editor.A great deal of his dialouge is peppered with repeat phrases which are only a little entertaining when you first hear them and then possitivly irksome when you read them four more times.Regrettably I give this book Two stars and I believe I have been kind.In retrospect I feel that if I had been ""sedated"" this book might have been enjoyable..."
3,Milk Toast,"Hey Ranger ! Is lightly entertaining & minimally informative. It is well written but the acronyms the writer makes up are corny & get old quick. It's just not that interesting !I read these type books on a regular basis & must say that it is below average & definately not on my Re Read list. I keep most of my books but this one will be gone when I'm finished. Try Jim Reardens ""Alaskas Wolf Man"", Pete From's book ""Indian Creek Cronicles"",Larry Kanuit's books or Dick Proenneke's story."
1,boring,Tedious and boring. Could have been written by Jack Web. Dull info. A lot of yada yada and little humor. To few amusing stories.
1,I sold this book to a used bookstore one day after reading it.,"You know that guy at work who tells really boring stories, tells bad jokes, and never figures out that everyone avoids him so they don't have to listen? Well, they exist in the Park Service too, and here's another one - Jim Burnett. Not only is Former Ranger Burnett's writing style and vocabulary reminiscent of a sixth grader, he also likes to make up ridiculously long and utterly unusable acronyms. If you are looking for some very light reading that's more worthy of painful moaning than laughter, then this book is for you.It is not for me.TryNature Noir: A Park Ranger's Patrol in the Sierraif you want a well-written, realistic view of a ranger's life."
4,"Ronald Reagan, My American Hero","I first became aware of our political system in the early '60s when Barry Goldwater was running for President. I liked him and listened to his speeches. Ronald Reagan introduced him and I was spellbound and voted for Goldwater. Even tho' he did not win, the message of these two men never left my heart and I have been a conservative Republican all these years. I was afraid whoever made this DVD would spin his message and try to disparage Reagan. This could not be done because it is mainly made up of his speeches in his own voice and words and his message resounds loud and clear. If you want pure Reagan, this is the DVD for you!!"
3,"Beware, Old Concert","As a great admirer of Sade I was very disappointed to get this DVD and find out that it is from a 1984 Munich concert. Additionally there are only nine songs from, what could be best described as a lackluster show. The entire DVD is 47 minutes and not even any extra material. What a rip off. I blame myself as there was no previous reviews and I jumped based on the assumption that it was a concert of newly released material from their Soldier of Love album. Their other DVDs are very good, high quality video and sound. This DVD is not very good in either category. Buyer beware, this DVD is only acceptable if you want an early and short version of a Sade concert."
1,False advertistment!!!,This is quintessential false advertisment...One is led to believe that this is a dvd of SADE's current concert tour.IS IT A CRIME!!??? It damn so IS!!!!
1,Dial face too light,The digital numbers were impossible to see I don't know if there was something wrong with the watch but the glare was terrible. I sent this watch back.
5,Very nice paper,This paper is very clean and white. Since its not cardstock its not as thick but it works wonderfully with stamps. Its also thick enough to sustain gamsol when use it with colored pencils. this paper will go a long way.
2,Not what I expected,"The paper is of a much lighter weight than expected. I sort of assumed that there would be only one weight for this paper, I had ordered this same paper from the Neenah website previously... so I can't really use it for what I was planning it. Also, I don't like that the watermark is so prominent... if you are using it for stationary, think twice. It is really in your face, and I find that disturbing on a letterhead."
2,Consistently damaged,"The paper itself is actually acceptable. However, every time I order it several reams (or partial reams) come damaged and unusable. It is shipped in the same box that the manufacturer puts it in. When shipping smaller quantities by common carrier, this item needs to be ""double-boxed"" so that the corners and edges are not damaged during shipment. This has become very frustrating. Maybe better to just buy locally?"
3,"Nice paper, good price. Too smooth.","I bought this Neenah Paper only because my letterhead, which I got printed by a professional printer, came on this paper, and I wanted to match it.Frankly, I prefer Southworth paper. This paper is more expensive than Southworth and does not have enough texture ... it is too smooth, and once it goes through the laser printer, it is smoother, giving my clients the impression I print my statements on plain old colored 'xerox' paper.The price is right, however, as I got it for about 15.00 a ream cheaper than the printer I bought it from originally."
5,Neenah paper,Who doesn't love this paper? It takes inks well and is a beautiful shade of white. It seems to be the paper most popular artists use in their videos.
3,Poor Quality,"Unfortunately, this tape is of relatively poor quality. The fabric base is thin and brittle and the adhesive leaves residue.Both of these problems make it poor for theatrical spike tape or equipment coding."
3,not widescreen,I'm giving this 3 stars not 4 because it is not widescreen. What really is the point of buying a DVD that is not widesreen? For some reason some DVDs don't seem to consider it important to tell you this before you order. I took my chances on this one and was disappointed.
1,Ugly,"This is one of the ugliest movies I have ever seen. Everything about it seemed ugly: the story, the characters, the events, the cinematography, the dialogue, the action. Real people just don't act like this.I have been fascinated by the story of Cabeza de Vaca and had real expectations of this film. But it proved itself a dud and less than a dud.My apologizes to those of you who really enjoyed this movie, but it did not make a connection with me. I did not like this movie and I simply cannot recommend it."
1,Unrecognizable fiction,"This movie has essentially nothing to do with the real Cabeza de Vaca. Buy and read the book, in Spanish if you can, or in English translation -- for example, ISBN 082630656X. It is no exaggeration to call his true story an epic, fascinating for those who trouble to understand what he is saying in it, and deeply meaningful. It is one of the great neglected masterpieces of eyewitness history. The author was not writing fiction in the slightest, but an account as truthful as his memory allowed, of his wanderings and struggle to survive for eight years in the unknown interior of America, among natives whose struggle to survive was generally as desperate as his own. By contrast, this movie is absurd fiction, apparently influenced by politically correct revisionism, containing hardly a hint of Cabeza de Vaca's sustaining Christian faith as anything positive. Although it would be possible to make a greatmovie on the subject, this movie is not it."
1,Dubious allegory at best,"The image on the box cover is from the last scene. Obviously, it is allegorical. Unfortunately, the entire movie is allegorical, whereas the work on which it is based, ""Naufragios,"" written by Cabeza de Vaca himself, is neither allegory nor any other sort of fiction, but a factual account of what happened to him during eight years of wandering among indigenous Americans who had never before met a European. (Despite Amazon's note, this review refers to the VHS version, but I know of no reason to believe that there is any difference between the VHS version and the DVD version.)"
1,Confusing and Boring,"I had really looked forward to viewing this movie. I guess I should have read all the reviews before I bought it. I was expecting a rendering of de Vaca's actual survival experiences and hoping to learn more about a fascinating bit of history. Instead the movie focused on a few of his experiences which were so mysterious as to be unintelligible and dragged those scenes out into sheer boredom. The movie jumped from one experience to the next with no narrative and no explanation of time passed. There was no way to understand the main character, much less empathize or sympathize with him. As my husband said after watching it, ""And you paid HOW MUCH for this movie????"""
3,Why i give a low score to a great movie?,"I agree whit all the good reviews, is not a good movie, is one of the best movies I have ever see, great in any aspect, but, Yes here comes the problems! The DVD is just a bad copy, whit the subtitles built in, no menus and the worst, Huuuu! This just make me sick! No 16:9 How can that be possible? Is a great movie, So why is not realised like a movie? I just hope this get to the person that is responsible of those mistakes, and even if there is no menu at least take off the subtitles and put it on widescreen the way is supposed to be."
4,ottimo libro,"salve a tutti, ho ordinato questo libro tramite amazon.com ma la prima volta non mi è arrivato, amazon mi ha rimborsato il mio credito, la seconda volta ho ordinato libro usato sempre su amazon.com ed è arivato puntuale. il libro è un ottimo libro sulla critica dei media, un argomento questo poco dibattuto nei giorni nostri. il libro contiene una serie di saggi che raccontano la storia della critica dei mass media e smaschera cosi un mondo solo apparentemente oggettivo."
5,How fun!,"I found these short stories only brought about more curiousuty. I would love to see many of them that were about little known characters developed into their own novels, and am greatful for the additional information on characters that have already been introduced. Thanks are due to Mrs. Kurtz for putting together this anthology."
5,This DVD features...,"Dog Gone / All You Can't EatFlea or Die! / CatDog FoodFull Moon Fever / War of the CatDogPumped / Dummy DummyNightmare / CatDogPigSquirrel Dog / Brother's DayThe Island / All You Need is LubeParty Animal / Mush, Dog, Mush!Diamond Fever / The PetShriek Loves Dog / Work Forceand that's all. A Part 2 DVD will come soon in 2012."
5,Catdog,"It's kind of funny... when I was offered the chance to review Catdog, I was thinking ""It's a cartoon! That won't fit on my blog."" Then as I was about to log off my email, a voice behind me said ""Catdog! I love that show! Mom, you have to get it!""My youngest kids are 12 and 8 years old... so they've actually only seen a couple of re-runs of Catdog. On the other hand, my oldest kids grew up watching it and have, I'm sure, seen every episode ever made. So in our family, as the saying goes... ""Everything old is new again!""I miss some of the older cartoons and prefer many of them over what is on today. My kids love watching them and some, like Catdog, actually have a moral to them. We enjoyed it!*I received a free DVD from Click Communications in exchange for my honest review. ~Thanks! :)"
5,Finally,Finally kids these days can watch real cartoons. Not that Icarly or anything. Catdog and Hey Arnold actually had values and were entertaining. I grew up in the 90s and loved all these shows.
5,Cat-Diggity-Dog!!!,"I used to get a kick out of this cartoon when it was on TV, and I'm not even a ""cartoon person"". Bought this and my kids loved it today as much as I did then. Great buy!!! I plan to buy Part 2 as well, which is apparently coming out in March 2012."
5,TV stand,"It's very nice looking - sleek and unobtrusive. The angled sides make it ""disappear"" so it doesn't stick out into the room. Not too difficult to put together, but an unimportant bracket was missing."
4,fine Product,Change of plans but the unit does what it is sold to do. Support heavy ass tube big screens...Would buy again if needed.
1,Kenn J. Hanlon,"Don't waist your money on this stand!It will take every bit of 2 hours to assemble. Not a problem in its self until you clean the glass and find the serous imperfections in the top, beveled, tempered, glass. When run through the beveling/polishing machine it was damaged and in handling received a few minor scratches as well. Prior to being tempered it had been washed and the streaks remained permanently! Made in china by Powell who could only asy I needed to go through Amazon. Well we all know how easy that is!I suppose I'll junk it eventually in favor of something that I will not buy on-line.Very disappointed!"
4,Not a continuous mix!,"As the other reviewer pointed out, disc 2 isn't trance and doesn't belong with the other two discs. Another thing I want to point out is that the material says that this is a continuous DJ Mix. It's not. Just a bunch of songs with gaps between them. Still a decent selection of trance music, but definite false advertising."
2,Truly A Winner,"This is the autobiography of Baltimore Colts middlelineback,Don Shinnick,who played during the team's glory years.Mr.Shinnick talks about his life and career,as well as his commitment to Christ.I read this book in college several years ago,and found it encouraging and readable.It's a lost treasure worth reading."
5,Thought Provoking Study,"This ""Study of the End Times"" is much more than a study of the Book of Revelations. Questions concerning Old Testament prophecies, Hell, Paradise, Lake of Fire, souls of the faithful and unfaithful, as well as the latter days of the world as we know it, are answered with scripture references both in the Old as well as the New Testament. It is obvious that the author has a keen knowledge of the Bible. This book was thoroughly engrossing and certainly merits a second and third study as there is so much to comprehend in the chapters."
4,Tape is bad,Hello: Film itself is great but tape it comes with is really bad. It would not stick on surface. Good thing I purchased extra 3M 2145C Indoor Insulator Film Mounting Tapes
4,"Save money, feel warm","I have used these window sealing kits in Iowa for a number of years. Pretty much standard issue in stores in that part of the world. Recently moved to Calif and is very hard to find. Given the old houses/apartments here (read: single pane, wafer thin windows, and leaky caulking) and the fairly cold night weather (temps in the 30's to 40's in winter), these are indispensable. Electric bills slashed by 5-10%, less dryness-causing heater use (and therefore less need for humidifier).And they are easily resuable. Just be careful when you take it down after winter is over, fold and store. Only wish they gave more tape to go with it."
4,Good but could use some improvements,"Don't get me wrong, I do believe these work. They can be a bit frustrating to install however. The plastic is tough and resists tearing however I found it a bit difficult to cut. And somehow I wish the company would mark cutting lines on the plastic that would go away with heat.Once I got the plastic up and applied the heat, these looked great and did what they advertised. I just believe you have to have the patience of a saint to be able to install more than 2 windows at a time."
4,insulation,"it does what it says it does! tape doesn't always stick to window seal very well, but have some patience and it helps"
1,Save Your Money!!,"This stuff does not work at all! Impossible to put on your windows if it's cold outside, which is when you want to put this on to keep the cold out! Plastic wrap does not stick to the tape and the tape barely sticks to the window sill. Overall, a complete waste of an hour and my money!"
3,Window film,cheap enough. I use every winter in my apartment. seems to do the job. Better than buying new windows. Whick is not an options because I rent.
1,Buy your own double sided tape,"The tape is really pathetic. It shouldn't even be called tape.If you're going to buy this product, save yourself endless frustration and buy some quality, heavy duty double-sided tape and don't use the tape that comes in the box. While you're at it, you might as well buy some saran wrap and just completely forget about this horrific product."
3,Hole-y Dissapointing,"I've made a point of only buying 3M window-covering kits for years now, due to some dissapointments about 5 years back, but decided to give Duck a try, as I've liked a number of their roll-tape products, they were cheaper than 3M, and I needed to cover a more than 5 windows, so I would be able to compare the two produts. Sadly, Duck has NOT been nearly as good . . . the window plastic is thinner than the 3M material, and the tape does not stick as well . . . I've been forced to check the windows over and over again, to re-stick where the sides may have blown out from a gust of wind outside. Next year, I'm sticking with 3M for all of the windows I cover."
1,Tape does not stick to film,"The tape supplied with this is pathetic.It stuck to my window sill / frame ok, but would not stick to the film. I used a hair dryer to try and get the wrinkles out, and the whole thing just pulled off the tape. So I did another window with this. I stuck it up, and did not use the hair dryer hoping the plastic would stay up. Less than 6 hours later, the plastic had fallen off the top section of the tape.I also tried the 3M tape, and that worked great. I used the 3M tape to finish off this plastic, and I will be ordering an extra roll or 2 of the 3M tape.I guess the duck can't do it."
4,works fine,"this product works great, it is a little challenging to cut the plastic perfectly. but assuming you are skilled enough to cut and measure accuratly this will work fine for you"
3,Inexpensive,"In comparison to other kits. However, I did not notice that my fuel bill gets any smaller. So I will continue to use it, hovewer, I won't have so much hope for huge savings."
3,Works Fine,"It works as far as I can tell. It is thinner than the Frost King brand that I have used for the past several years though, but I don't know if that is good, bad, or doesn't matter."
1,Waste of Money,"Paid $8.99 for a piece of thin plastic, a double-sided tape, and six alcohol surface wipes. Double sided tape cannot hold the plastic and the plastic came out within few minutes. If you are using it to seal the drafts and make your home more energy efficient, I don't think it's worth the time and money. I ended up using packaging tape to seal the drafts for the time being which is much better and cheaper alternative."
1,not usable,"AFTER I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT, I FOUND THAT THE ADHESIVE TAPE WAS WOUND BACKWORD AND THE PRODUCT WAS NOT USABLE."
2,Beware: Double sided tape will peel paint!,"I bought two packages of this Henkel Duck product and completed nine 3x5 windows in my apartment.*This product came with poor/minimal instructions.*I tried calling the Henkel Duck company and sat on hold for over 20 minutes and finally gave up trying to get a hold of someone about my questions.*I found it time consuming to cut the 3x5 sheets and it was not easy cutting a straight line.*THE WORST PROBLEM: The double sided tape DOES PEEL PAINT OFF. So, now thanks to Henkel Duck I have a painting project to complete.I do not recommend this product."
2,Sub-Par Film,"Lets get to the nitty gritty. If you are looking for the easiest kit out their to insulate your windows, this is NOT it. It comes as one big roll of plastic and is awkward to handle. Other kits come with pre-sized sheets that are much easier to manage. I am pretty handy, but this really is just a pain sometimes. It does work though."
4,More than enough & Easy to install,"We recieved this product over the weekend and had 10 windows to do. We live in a mobile home, so the windows are a little smaller than standard. This one kit is more than enough to do your entire trailer. The adhesive tape works fine as long as you thoroughly wipe your surface with alcohol pads. I would also suggest going over your exact measurements because it's easier to apply and adjust when you have some slack and then trimming off the excess afterward. The first window, we did exact measurements and I'm not an expert at keeping this straight so I had to pull on the one side to get it over to the adhesive and ended up ripping it. I was really impressed that this isn't like the old transluscent kind where you could not see outside. If appled correctly, you don't even notice it's there. Very satisfied."
1,Totally worthless.,"I really wanted the 3M version, but it wasn't available locally, so I went with this product. I attempted one window twice with the same results - it wouldn't stick to the window or the tape! This product is totally worthless. I will be return it and ordering the 3M version."
1,horrible product,"The film is fine, the tape sticks to my window frames, no problem. What the tape won't do is stick to the plastic.This is Duck brand. Hello??How hard can it be to make tape strong enough to stick to lightweight plastic??Now I'm still cold--and I'm out the money I spent on the stupid kit.DON'T buy this."
3,Works well,"Great product but you see a haze and spotting at times with light. Works as advertised as I have been using this product for years.I would strongly recommend the 3M version, it's mill is thicker and better quality."
5,Wish I had done this earlier.,"It took me about an hour to do several windows. There window panes were always cold to touch in the winter and the rooms were a little chilly. Immediately I feel more comfortable and the sheet does not feel cold, so I am sure I am saving energy. Very affordable and fool proof to apply. Applying a warm hair dryer makes the film shrink so that it stretches taut, so that any wrinkles disappear and you can barely see it. A truly useful product."
4,time consuming but worth it,"We purchased a kit when we were tired of our outrageous energy bill and had little choice for cheap, single-pane apartment windows. We noticed a difference right away with no draft, within a couple hours in the temperature of the room. We ended up using it on all the windows, as it works so well and comes off without leaving marks or damage. It did take about an hour per window, but we had a lot of condensation to wipe and are perfectionists haha."
2,Did not last,"The product consists of a tape and plastic. The plastic was a little cumbersome to cut but managable. Once I got the insulation up, it seemed to be working fine. I put it on four separate windows - 3 of them consisting of Duck insulation, and one a 3M product. It is about two weeks from the time I put these up. Two of the Duck insulation tapes have already started peeling off. :(. It does definitely keep the house a little warmer though."
4,Seems to work well,"Figuard I would try this out on my old single pains to save a little money.Easy to do.1.Use wipes to clean surfaces2.apply 2x tape3.afix plastic4.trim if needed5.Heat (says to use a hair dryer but I don't have one so I used a heat gun on low)Turned out real nice, just hope when it comes time to remove it is easy and doesn't mess with the pain on my trim."
2,Henkel Patio Door plastic,I usally get this product every winter to do my windows and patio doors. This year I had to hunt very hard to find it and even had to order the patio door plastic on-line. After using this product this year I have found that the tape does not work very well this time. I have had to redo just about every window and patio door that I put it on this time. I was not pleased with the product this year at all. I hope you will let them know how bad this product is this time.
1,Waste Of My Time And Money,"Installed this product in a room with 8 windows. Followed the directions completely. Lasted about a week, then the tape on every window let loose. Don't wasted your time, get the 3M version."
3,Good idea but...,"I have done window film around my windows before, however this product was new for me. The plastic is very thin, slightly thicker than saran wrap. One would buy this product because they have a drafty window, so you'd think the tape would be able to withstand the draft. Only 2 days after applying it some of the film came detached from the tape and it had to be redone.It is helping somewhat, but I feel a thicker plastic and something stronger to adhere it to would have worked better. I am in Michigan and the coldest months aren't here yet. I am hoping it makes an impact on my heat bill, but we shall see what happens....Aside from the downfalls - it was easy to apply, shipped quickly, and the instructions were clear. So I am not completely negative about the product. I just feel some tweaks should be made to make it better."
4,"Great Product, Does the Job","I've used this item for my drafty windows and it worked like promised. The film has been up on the windows for months now and it hasn't detached, moved, etc. I hear it crinkle sometimes when a draft comes through the window, but it is holding up well. I even installed it over a window with an AC unit it and I put it right over the AC unit. Just had to be very careful about how I cut the shape and how I attached it to the window. Take your time and it will come out right."
1,Do not waste your money.,"Followed instructions, cleaned the surface thoroughly with the provided ""dry"" alcohol wipes and let it sit for several minutes to allow any alcohol to dry up before applying the tape. Double sided tape was not sticky at all and therefore fell immediately off of the window frame. Product was complete garbage. Took it back for a refund and ended up purchasing what seems to be a generic brand from Home Depot, which worked great. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,horrible,"Not as simple as they make it sound! Trying to cut flimsy plastic that comes in a folded mess of 62"" x ""210 is not exactly simple. Taking mine back to the ""Wal"" store I got it at and will shop elswhere. After I finally got a sheet cut it pulled away from the tape after 1 week! HORRIBLE PRODUCT. Don't waste your time, spend a little more and get a quality product!"
1,Save your cash,"you can get the shrink wrap flim in bigger quantities for far less somewhere else. Doesn't stick, but I managed to use it for one season."
1,Does Not Work as Advertised,The plastic is too thin and the double sided tape does not hold. After a couple of weeks I had to go back and re-tape over half the edges with packing tape. I had to take it down from one window and just put up regular plastic sheeting and taped it up with packing tape. I would not recommend this to anyone. A waste of money.
5,Window Shrink Film,"Duck Brand window kits have crystal clear film and are easy to install. Double sided tape adheres firmly to window moldings. Works well on painted/varnished wood, aluminum and vinyl.Guarantees a draft-proof seal. Great for indoor and outdoor useNon-splitting shrink film and tape removes cleanly and easily at the end of the season with no residue.Kit insulates 10 standard 3-Feet by 5-Feet windows."
4,Did the job if you follow instructions,"I bought this product with some hesitation after reading the reviews, but like another person said, if you follow the instructions all the way and don't skip any, the product will work great! Still covering my windows three weeks afterwards and going strong! The only downside, is my windows are the same size as the one on the box so i ran out of plastic pretty soon but that's about it."
1,You get what you pay for - not much.,I purchased this product in 11/11 and by 12/11 the plastic was already coming off the five windows I had put it on. The tape is not adhesive and the plastic is easily torn. For some reason I had forgotten that I purchased this same brand several years ago and had the same experience. Never again. Spend the extra money and get 3M.
3,Should have read the info more carefully,"I bought this thinking I got a great deal, but I should have read the information more closely - it is one big sheet, not 5 pieces, as I imagined. As it turned out, we could only cover 2 windows (I guess they're larger than normal?)Now I'm reading reviews that the tape unsticks after a few weeks. I hope this isn't true, but we'll see.Two stars because I don't like it, but part of that is my error.EDIT 4/18/12: We took the plastic off about a month ago, so apparently the tape held just fine, contrary to what another review stated. After all that, I'm upgrading it to 3 stars."
1,Doesn't stick! Shrinks and Detaches,"I have 4 rooms and 4 large windows, I have had to redo each one because once the film was heated, it kept shrinking and pulled the tape off the frame.Sucks, going back to old brand"
5,Excellent product! Read the instructions so you are not disappointed and write bad reviews.,"After reading the instructions completely and knowing I was not suppose to place this product on the painted surfaces or drywall, I must say it was the easiest and best solution to our problem!! I stuck the double stick tape directly to my aluminum frame all around the window. I used the blowdryer and got the film to a crystal clear state. Clean your windows inside first! The drafts coming through our bedroom windows are gone! I didn't have to get new window coverings to help with the drafts. The draft was the problem and now it is gone. My husband sleeps right next to the window and has thanked me every night."
4,Works,"One giant sheet of plastic. I have three large windows, so it covered all of them with not much to spare. Didn't cut easily, but was easy to rip. For the price it works."
2,Tape is useless,As soon as the weather got cold (within about three weeks of us putting the tape up) the whole thing has come down. The tape is just not sticky enough to hold the plastic onto the window frame.
1,Spend the extra few dollars on the 3M version,"I've used both the 3M and Duck tape version of this product. The 3M version is far superior. The only reason I used this version this time around is because the hardware store was sold out of the 3M ones. The (clueless) sales associate tried to tell me they were equally effective, but they are not AT ALL. The tape doesn't stick to the window as well, nor does the plastic stick to the tape, which totally defeats the purpose because it's supposed to be sealed off in order to work. In addition, the plastic is not long enough for my windows, and even though I do live in an older house, this was not an issues with the 3M version. So not only did I waste my money, I wasted hours putting this product up in my house and then trying to ""patch the holes"" with 3M packing tape. I've also tried the Ace Hardware version, and even that is superior to this version. Don't waste your time and money, go with 3M!!!"
1,save your money and buy something else,"Tape doesn't stick to plastic, plastic rips easily. Save your money and buy something else"
1,I guess I lack the essential skills to make this work.,"I tried to use this today - I got the double sided tape up onto my window and then was faced with the problem of how exactly to cut the giant piece of plastic down to just the right side. I wasted a good quarter of it trying to get it right. When I finally got a piece that I thought might be ok, I attempted to stick it up onto the double sided tape. But when I released the plastic, the tape would not hold the weight of it (it is very light), and the plastic just fell off. I read the instructions. I followed them. I gave up. At least this failed experiment cost me less than ten bucks."
5,really works,I love this . It really works for our home downstairs and up. Keeps it alot warmer dstairs in winter causing that heat to come up! I recommend. we love it. Easy to put up.
1,Do Not Purchase,"The tape will not keep product securely attached. After I shrunk with hair dryer, with in 1 week half of the window film was lifted! Buy 3M product, I will next time!"
1,Waste of money,The tape does not stick for long allowing air leaks after all of the expense and work and its worthless
4,works great,"works great no problems with instalation or at least i had no problem using it, fairly simple to put up adn get in place"
2,"Good, but probably not what you need","Most windows you are looking to winterize will be coverable by the 10 piece kit Duck offers. Only use this if you are covering a window that doesnt meet the length of that one, else you will end up wasting a good bit of plastic."
1,AWFUL/DEFECTIVE Window Shrink!!!,"We purchased three (3) boxes of the Duck Brand 5-Window shrink. Though we have used this product in the past, we believe we received three defective boxes from the retailer who sold us these on Amazon. We have used this brand for the past four years. This time, all the plastic pulled away from the tape. Obviously there was a problem with his batch and it is sad that it was sold to us. We had to re-buy all new plastic after having put it all up in our entire lower level. We will never buy this product from Amazon again nor anything from the seller!!!! No Good!!! This deserves zero stars for a rating!!!"
2,Not the size stated on the package,"Material is slightly thicker than the hardware brand I used for years. Tape holds to my metal window frame, shrinking to seal with hairdryer visibly works and the sealing seems to be holding after a few days.However, like many of the other comments, the size listed on the package is wrong. It is NOT 84"". I was able to work around this, as I bought more than needed for my large window, but be warned. Also, there is nowhere near enough tape included, so buy extra."
1,Broken in 5 minutes,"I thought that a glass bottle would be healthier for a hamster and easier to clean than the plastic. We also were hoping for a bottle that did not leak like a plastic one that we got from the pet store. Unfortunately, we never got to try it out. When my 10 year old son filled it up and put in the rubber stopper, the glass broke. Since it was only $3, we did not bother to send it back. We since ordered a plastic one that works well for $2 more. Also the rubber stopper leaves a strong petroleum smell on our hands. The glass is too delicate for kids."
4,Great water bottle if ...,I have several of these and they are my pets favorite bottles however they don't feed water into the tube if the tube is completely vertical. I have to use baby links to put this bottle at an angle but then it works great especially for small animals like mice which I always worry with the ball they wont get enough water. This would also be great for dwarf hamsters as they dont drink much ( all 3 of mine love it)
2,Breaks,I love that this bottle doesn't leak but it's impossible to get the cap off once it's in. You will probably end up breaking it.
5,Great Tool,"This is by far the best 10 bucks i ever spent. Why they aren't offered in the box stores is beyond me. This will save you lots of time and digging to replace a faulty pop up sprinkler assembly. If you use rain bird pop up sprinklers, this is a must have and a no brainer."
2,Don't even think about networking it,"The positive: I wanted an ""industrial strength"" printer/copier/fax for my home which has a PC network and some heavy users. As a STANDALONE, or attached to ONE PC, this is every bit the product advertised.HOWEVER, the Canon IC D680 is not compatible with the print servers that come built into home networking hardware. You have to buy another $170 proprietary print server from Axis. I did, and regret it. The Canon/Axis combo is HIGHLY UNSTABLE on my network, especially when interfacing with Windows XP PCs. It usually works for a few documents and then fails. Failure requires a server reset, and often a complete DRIVER REINSTALL on the offending PC (2 CDs and 2 reboots!). It's a nightmare, and Canon tech support (which isn't available nights or weekends) has no idea what's wrong. I've been back and forth with them half a dozen times, including several multi-hour calls, and 2 months into ownership can't get it working.Don't go here, it's miserable."
4,Glorious Dawn,Wonderful and exciting. I ran the gambit of emotions on this one. Well writen and edited. The charicters were strong and dominering. I enjoyed it very much. The sex was good without being graphic. Well done.
4,Glorious Dawn,"When I first discovered Dorothy Garlock's books, I was captured by her story telling ability. I almost felt like I was in that period of time with her details in the story. I read all of her books that I can get my hands on. In Glorious Dawn, she captures the reader and keeps us entertained. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes historicals."
5,"The book that changed my life...well, at least my career.","I bought Levine's book to help me promote myself when I struck out on my own as a freelance copywriter. The book did more than help me promote myself--it gave me an outlook that reordered my relationship with my clients. And, oh yeah, helped me make stacks (small stacks, but stacks nonetheless) of money in the process.Specifically, the book provides tips and formats that allow writers of average ability to present themselves as professionals. The book's conversational style and logical, progressive organization make it both an easy read and a quick reference tool. Also, the book gives advice and starting reference materials to help PR novices get off the ground on their contact databases.Mostly, though, the book gave me an attitude--a concept of the way PR ought to be done. This has led to about 90% of my business being PR related. Thanks, Michael!"
4,guerrilla PR: how you can wage an effective publicity campaign,"even though his book was written (1993) before the internet was a way to communicate and advertise, this book shows that determination and follow through are very important in public relations."
5,One of the most practical books on PR in recent years,One of the most practical short books on PR and publicity to come out in recent years. Mr. Levine shows that PR is an attitude more than expertise- good news for small business owners and entrepreneurs.
5,"Young, Guerilla-Minded, Publicist Seeking Opportunity?","Great book that exemplifies our out-of-the-box marketing and p.r. mentality of this Los Angeles-based internet start-up. If you read this book and then think -- hey, I can do even *better* than these guys -- then send us your resume and tell us how and why."
2,Good Travel Reading,"I'm scared to fly so I took this book on a plane with me when I had to visit my grandparents in Winnipeg. It immediately transported me to the wonderful and magical world of public relations!!! I soon forgot I was on a plane, and suddenly I felt like Colin Farrell's character in Phone Booth--you know where that guy held him hostage on the phone to make him repent for his sleazy ways. I especially like how the guy called Farrell out for claiming to be this big shot PR guy with all these connections, but actually he had no real connections at all. I also visited the wonderful olden days of PR like in the movie Sweet Smell Of Success where Tony Curtis is the PR man. Whenever he walks into a room, people cannot hide their contempt for this scumbag. I like at the end how he ends up getting the stuffing kicked out of him.I arrived in Winnipeg safely all thanks to Michael Levine and his book about what sleazy liars PR people are."
2,Dark Prince,"Althought I like Nick Mancuso and usually movies about the Marquis De Sade, I didn't like this one. Good cast/not so good plot.I bought it/then viewed it. Would not recommend the same. Lisa C,"
2,Arty porn,I am not a prude and I have read the works of DeSade but I was uncomfortable with some of the nudity in this film. Otherwise the story was good and the acting adequate. There was a lot more to DeSade than the film told the audience.
4,intertwins sade and his characters,it was a great portral of sade and his charecters from his books. it weaves sades life and his fiction beautifully. it takes you into sade's mind. nick mancuso was amazing as sade. if you enjoy any of sades writing youll love this movie!
2,Thumbs Down,"It's great to see these guys playing together. Nice selection of tunes. However, the drumming may seem flawless at first, but Carl Palmer has unfortunately never understood the concept of playing ""in the pocket."" Very distracting. Not recommended if you have a well developed sense of rhythm. The original studio recordings are much better performances."
5,Thank Heavens Asia Is Back!,"I recently saw Asia at the Music Mill in Indianapolis, and had forgotten just how good they are. John Wetton still has that voice. Carl, Steve and Geoff were in top form. I couldn't wait to get this DVD, and I wasn't disappointed. This is the same show I had seen! If you like Asia, buy this DVD. The concert is not a huge production with flashing lights and glitz. It's about the music, and the incredible songs they created. Enjoy!!!!!"
5,Sheer pleasure,"Excellent product, image quality is very good and very sharp. My only reservation would be about the sound. Modern techniques allow for better recording and/or better editing. All in all, a must have for all Asia fans, they still really got it!"
3,"not bad, but...","OK... the music here is great. The band sounds good considering how long it's been since the first album. I like the mix of songs that were played. I like Without You best- I always loed that song and it gets a good presentation here. The band performs well of course- they are all excellent musicians. I have to laugh when Steve Howe jumps up and down and then does the chicken walk... it's out of character for him and he's old so he just looks foolish. I only gave 3 stars because the stage presentation is very disappointing. The screen looks like its mostly a computer screen saver and the lighting is just plain dull. I must admit I felt the $16 I paid on Amazon was a little high after I picked up the amazing Remember That Night DVD from David Gilmour from Best Buy for $12 (and that is a double DVD with a ton of music and the best extra features I've seen on ANY DVD so far).Over all I'm glad I picked it up, but it could have been better."
3,Too clean,"This is a great band that can do everything, except rock music.Their performance is highly professional, but they definitely do not ""rock the house down"". It's all too clean, too insipid, too perfect. They simply don't spark.But the overall tone is beautiful. The songs are crafted with extreme talent by the four musicians involved, all of them showing their age but also showing their enormous talent and taste.So, this is a good DVD to watch and enjoy quietly in the still of the night. But it's not a rock concert, really isn't."
5,One of my favorite small kitchen appliances,"I have had this coffee grinder for at least two years and absolutely love it! I typically grind a medium to dark roast kona coffee, use it daily and take it apart to clean it maybe twice a year, as it does gum up over time. I usually grind directly into my gold filter basket, holding it directly under the spout (keep your hands off the little steel cover) and NEVER have to clean up coffee grounds off my kitchen counter. I love the look of the grinder on my counter top and love that I only have to drag out my coffee beans every couple of weeks to add more to the grinder.I'm simply amazed at how vehemently some reviewers hate this product, given how much I love it!"
1,What a mess!,"I was so excited to receive this Kitchen Aid grinder as a Christmas gift. I can't clearly express my disappointment and frustration with this grinder. I've since read numerous reviews about the coffee grinds left behind or sent flying all over the counter. I am a witness to this disaster. Each morning I cringe knowing the mess I will have to clean up before enjoying some coffee. Grinds are sent in all directions. I clean the spout out after each use to no avail. I boxed up the grinder this morning and will return it for a Cuisinart burr mill grinder. It's half the price and it does not leave the mess behind. I'm amazed that Kitchen Aid continues to manufacture this product with the problems of shooting grinds. Don't buy this grinder, unless you like to spend your morning cleaning your counter!"
1,Don't buy CD this like I did. I expected too much from it.,"Well, deep voices that sound forced, some mispronouncing of words, and music just mashed together like a cheesy garage band.I see no reason to enjoy it."
2,Not too great....,"Du Hast was covered pretty well, it is probably the best song on here... Links started out not too lively, but overall the music and vocals are pretty good..... Seemann and Mutter were done pretty well.... Klavier is pretty good except the singer trys to scream during the chorus...... WIDBIFS has good music, but the vocals arent great...... I don't really care for any of the other songs.... So out of 11 songs, I only really care to listen to 4 or 5.The style of music isnt the same as Rammstein's, but depending on your taste, you may actually like this album, which is why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. Unless you're into really dark music, hardcore metal stuff I wouldnt spend my money on it...."
1,Ouch!!!,"Yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF! This is by far the worst tribute album ever. The only good track was.....naw, there wasn't even one good cover track. Nope, not one! Don't buy this CD until it drops to a penny, or until you find one in a cereal box. This Cd is soooooooooo stupid."
3,"Interesting, but not Rammstein","The CD is ok, but the songs don't manage to give back the grace of the originals. Some of the interprets had better take some German lessons too ... sounds really funny if you actually know the language."
1,no,I picked this up in a store and was hoping for a lot better. Theres was 1 or 2 dedent songs only. Stick to the real rammstein.
1,HORRIBLE!,"Rammstein did not deserve this! This is probably one of the worst albums I've ever heard. The music was weird and bad, and didn't hold a candle to the originals. The singers were AWFUL and for some reason sang in a really bad, forced grummble-voice. They mispronounced lots of words and I think they didn't even get some of them right at all, although I won't listen to it again to find out. They didn't sound like they even understood the words. There was not one song on the album that was any good, everything was done bad, some worse than others... Zwitter comes to mind as one of the worst. Not even the new music was any good on its own. This album is a complete and utter disgrace and does not in ANY way flatter Rammstein."
3,Satisfactory,Satisfactory adventure film. There are enough tense moments to make the film interesting. The story moves along quickly. The film and actors will win no awards but I found the movie enjoyable enough.
1,Sad rationalization,Its a sad rationalization of a series of horrible decisions. The fact the one writer says that having a child would have been far worse than the pain she experienced having an abortion is saddening. How could she not value another's life. It is a story of selfishness. Those should take a deeper look at what they are doing in supporting the death of a baby. ...God bless.
1,Stories to Justify Killing of the Unborn,"Well written book, and some very sad stories indeed, but all to justify to killing of their unborn children. I once my self was pro-choice, but after learning the facts that abortion really does kill another human being I could no longer appeal to these kind of bad argruments, sad though they may be. None of these stories could justify the killing of the unborn. It's sad to see that today we have a ""class"" of people the ""unborn"" being considered as trash, blobs of tissue, a product, instead ofwhat they really are ""Precious unborn human persons"""
5,Really helpful book,"I ordered this book after reading the reviews, and was glad I did. It is well written and based on research that is clearly annotated. Having lived with chronic back pain and been through two surgeries, I was familiar with much of the information. But, the sections on how different personality types respond and manage pain, was very thought provoking and helpful. I also found the sections on different types of medication to be some of the clearest information I have found so far. Overall, I got some very helpful ideas that seem grounded on medical research and not biased in any direction, unlike some books about one type of treatment."
1,Bad deal,"I have purchased headphones from these guys before this last batch that I bought, and they were fine (I generally buy 2 at a time). But recently I bought two, and the first pair the chord frayed which led to loss of sound in one ear. Then I switched to using my back up pair, and a week after I opened it, one of the earbuds spontaneously came apart for no reason. Again, the headphones sound great, but they fall apart quick. Not worth the 8 bucks (2+S.H.)."
3,Nice to have,"In my opinion the title does not cover the contents. The contents is by far more textual than visual. I was expecting a collection of models, process flows, graphs, templates, forms and pics with a how to... Something like 50/50 text and visuals. So it didn't meet my expectations, not by a long shot.However, it is a little more richly illustrated than the usual textbooks on the matter and the authors use clear language to explain complex systems. Further it covers some ground not covered in PMBOK or PRINCE2. Therefor I decided to keep it."
2,Not Useful to Me,"I bought this book when it first came out, after browsing through it carefully in a bookstore.However, I never used it, and never found a need to use it. I must add that I had had my PMP for several years before I bought it, and that is perhaps in line with many other comments here: a lack of depth. It might be good for someone who wants to know what is project management, at a high level, but does not plan on using it to actually do the work."
2,Traditional vs. Complex Project Management,"I'm currently reading everything I can find on complex project management and this one was a big disappointment. The sub-title ""Models and Frameworks for Mastering Complex Systems"" suckered me in. In fact, this is a great texbook on everything we already knew. But it barely scratches the surface--it touches on Agile--of what we're learning on complexity science and chaos theory, particularly from the military. Skip this one."
4,Jewel like you've never heard her before....,"After the success of the 'Serve the Ego' dance mixes (a first for Jewel), she decided to add eletronica rhythms to her signature acoustic/rock style. And it sounds great! The tempo throughtout 'Intuition' is the same from beginnning to end (which I find to be kinda hypnotic). Blending the dance rhythms with live drums and guitars gives this tune an almost hip-hop feel to it (which ain't Jewel territory for sure). 'Intuition' has unearthed Jewel's versitility and her potential to be a dance diva. Fans of her traditional style shouldn't be worried, though. Jewel has not dropped her folk rock to be the female version of Moby. Instead, Lester Mendez (her producer) has taken her signature style and added fantastic new rhythmic sounds to take Jewel to the next level. And, of course, the live acoustic version of her 2001 hit 'Standing Still' is classic Jewel at her best. A worth while listen for sure!"
3,Gotta Love It,"C'mon now you true Jewel fans, she is still sending us her feelings with heartfelt lyrics, just new beats to the music. If you love the old stuff, then keep listening to it. Everyone evolves sometimes in their lives. If you don't like the cd, sell it to someone who appreciates it. Otherwise, you won't be dissapointed."
5,A Really Fun CD To Listen To!,"When I first heard the song ""Intuition"" on the radio, I thought that it was being sung by someone else. When I saw the video on TV and saw that it was Jewel, I was quite surprised because even though I wasn't previously a fan of hers, I knew that this song was very different from some of her other songs that had I heard on the radio and different from her other music videos that I've seen. However, I liked the transition that Jewel made by doing ""Intuition"" because it's such a fun song that's incredibly catchy and makes you feel really good. I must say that I'm definitely into Jewel now, and I can't wait to get her new album when it comes out."
1,Painful,"This song (and presumably future CD) is just plain horrible. I would buy the argument that the artist is trying some new directions - if the music was anything ground breaking! This sounds like regurgitated pop .... that begs me to ask the question: Who was it when they were producing this ablum that thought it actually sounded good? One final news flash, Jewel in a wet T-Shirt contest at the end of the video for Intuition might make people watch it more, but it doesn't make the song any better. My skin is crawling just thinking about this song."
2,ok song,seems like a throwaway Brittney Spears Song but this if nothing else gives Jewel a long overdue spin to Her music presentation.I think&feel though She waited a few years to late though however.but it is interesting.
4,Fresh New Sound,"Regardless of what you hear about Jewel being called a 'sellout', the fact of the matter is that her new single, 'Intuition' is a great, upbeat track. It's fresh and fun to dance to. Although I prefer her old sound and look more, Jewel still sings about her thoughts on society. The lyrics didn't change. They are just now accompanied by a dance beat. I am really looking forward to her new album."
3,a newer draft of my previous review,"Ok so I know I completely bashed Jewel's new single in my previous review, but I guess this song just takes a while getting used to.It's still no masterpiece, but it's a well-written piece of pop with a driving beat and electrifying chorus.I wasn't some big fan of Jewel back when she was still an artist, so it's not that big of a deal for me that she went from artist to pop tart.Anyways, it's not like she'll ever write another song that even compares to Foolish Games (and I mean the album acoustic version, not the poppy single version of it).Anyway, it's a fun song, nothing more.But I have to say, it really grew on me."
2,Why in the would she go to pop from light rock + country?,"What in the world happened here? I swear about 18 months ago, she was singing soft rock and country, and now she's going into pop? Please, Jewel, don't turn into Britney Spears! Why don't singers just pick a type of music and stick with it!? She like completely changed her music and style and in way she's like ""P!NK"", which isn't necessarily a good thing. She was much better with singing songs like ""Hands"" and ""This Way"" then going into ""Intuition."" I was kind of surprised when I listened to the radio and all of the sudden that song came on and the announcer said it was Jewel, I was like WHAT???!!! That doesn't sound like Jewel Kilcher. It's a lot better to stick with your track then it is to try and get on local hit stations. I liked it a lot better when she wasn't overplayed on the radio. Nice try, Jewel, but next time just stick to your routes, please.~Allie-Cat"
2,A clever idea that failed miserably.,"I hate the phrase ""selling out."" If Ms. Kilcher wants to try some new songwriting styles, more power to her.But the chord progression in this song is literally PAINFUL to hear. The chorus sounds like nails on a chalkboard. The beats are rote and boring.I'd give it one star but for the fact that I suspect she was attempting to subvert some pop conventions with the single. (""Digital girl"" et al.) So, another star for effort.I'd just prefer to see her writing brought forth in a way that doesn't make me think of the worst of the worst dance-pop."
1,ugh,"Evidence Jewel has sold her soul: the music track of her latest single already being used in a commercial...Just what does selling disposable razors have to do with Jewel? And which came first, the song or the razor? ugh.Goodbye, Jewel. Say hello to the 99 cent bin."
1,Could it get any worse?,"I was shocked and disgusted at learning this song was sung by Jewel. Jewel, in my opinion, destroyed her roots to recreate herself as another Britney Spears...singing just for the money and the fame. Anyone who is familiar with Jewel would realize this. She has changed her style completely, from folk/acoustic to mainstream pop. If you're one who likes bubblegum music, pastel colors, and facades, then please, buy this single. If you long for the old, genuine Jewel, then you'll have to head elsewhere. This ma'am's gone onto a DIFFERENT track. We'll miss you, Jewel."
4,"An Honest, Touching First Novel","This is a novel told straight from the heart, told with lucidity and honesty. Ms. Morrell may be young, but she is an author to keep an eye out for."
4,Great Job Sanami-sama!,"This book is one of the best in the series. It's story is line is fairly simple in this book, Ryo and Dee are to protect the wife of Ryo's parents murderer. This book has some fairly graphic content hence the M rating. If you don't like Yaoi, which is in this book unlike the previous which delt with shonen-ai, I suggest you look elsewhere. This book recieves 4 stars out of 5 for the graphic content and lack of some main characters."
3,"Okay, but unoriginal","Although an accurate reflection of Kungfu Record's bands and styles, it still is an average, unoriginal compilation. Bands Audio Karate, Useless ID and Tsunami Bomb are great examples of bands who know how destroy a song with terrible lyrics. In fact, Audio Karate's ""Senior Year"" has the sappiest, most moronic lyrics I have ever heard. Ozma has two good selections, and these two songs definately bring up my rating. Antifreeze plays really unoriginal cliche love-sick loser quasi punk. The vandals songs, have hilarious lyrics, however as a band they're not that good. Mi6 plays good skate punk, the vocals are good and the songs are pretty catchy, another highlight of the mix. No use For A Name is just another average band, and one that doesnt sound that great live either. The Ataris are just awesome and these two tracks close the mix on an up note. But overall, this is an average to weak compilation and proof that Kungfu should shake up their line up. But not bad for 5 bucks."
2,Bad,"Normally these bands are excellent, and tsunami bomb is great, as are the ataris.however, there is such a thing as pop punk....bands like good charlotte and simple plan arent pop punk.leave out the latter, and thats them...pop. blink-182 are pop/punk, and as are green day. pop punk is defined by rebellious songs, as well as fun songs...pure punk was all POLITICAL rock which is not to be expected of poppunk bands....oh and by the way sum41 has never and will never appear on the atticus cds."
3,Heavy heavy heavy,"This one looks great. Functionality? so-so. It's heavy! It's hard to grip. My fingers just weren't comfortable holding it. It just didn't feel right. One slip from your hand and your fingers are on the edge. The slippery handle wasn't design with a ""stop"". There's nothing separating the handle and the blade. I just didn't feel confident or safe using it in a fast paced, high pressure environment."
2,You get what you pay for,"This little radio is cheap. I can get one very faint AM channel on this radio but you have to struggle to hear it. It was kind of cool putting it together with my nine year old. It has a lot of little parts, but like I said it is cheap and only barely gets one very faint channel. I did everything to boost up the signal but no go. Even plugged it in through my guitar amp. If you live near a AM tower it might be worth it, I mean it was only 10 bucks and it does have a little educational value."
2,Radio Science Project,"I made this radio as a science project with my 10-year old daughter. It definitely was not an easy build. Directions are...okay..we finally got it done, but it was a long process.At the end it barely worked--could just hear a tiny voice through the earpiece. It is possible that we miswired along the way--there are a surprising number of connections to make, but no special tools or soldering required.It does teach how complex such products are, and there was excitement to hear it finally work. It was very easily broken at the science fair as there are so many wire connections that just easily pull out."
3,Another Opinion,"This cd may not have been well engineered; I don't know, but every selectionwas derived from various original RCA sources that certainly were, such as themagnificent Carnegie Hall concert. However, to say that Kate Smith's voicewas ever deficient in any way displays a radical departure from the generally accepted opinion of even those who may not have a ""nostalgic"" interest in her performances. Kate Smith's voice is usually acknowledged to have been one ofthe greatest of the 20th century, lavished on over 2000 titles in the course ofan almost fifty year career. Many of her cds are out of print and command very high prices. I'd say that this one is probably worth trying if the buyer doesn't already have everything it contains."
3,Not as bad as claimed,"This is not the disaster some of the other reviews suggest. It is slow, and it is quite pretentious, but if you get into the rhythm of it, it is a worthwhile movie. Jost is no Eric Rohmer (even if the actress here played the lead role in ""Boyfriends and Girlfriends""), but this film, set in Manhattan amidst both the art and high finance world (and with a Vermeer painting appearing predominantly, for no apparent reason), ends up being a quietly beautiful effort."
2,"Good idea, but prone to issues","This matrix switch is a great idea; however, analog switching is a nightmare, especially in a complicated setup. First of all, many TV's don't have a digital input. I had to buy digital to analog converters. Then I would get various kinds of interference on the receiver end. Most of them had to do with poor cables, bad connections, etc. The problem is there are so many analog cables that it's very hard to troubleshoot. I ended up spending hours trying to chase my own tail to find out what was causing issues. When one problem was solved, another would come up.Ended up, scrapping the whole idea and going for Vanco hdmi over coax solution paired with a 4x4 hdmi matrix."
1,Packing a very poorly made,"I would like Amazon to see how the state came the dictionary that I bought. The book is with the torn edges. A shame. I will return it and I would like to receive a new dictionary, tightly packed, no spoiled."
4,Disappointed,"I really liked this dictionary, my friend had a copy, so I ordered it. This must be a newer edition, some of the words, esp Brit slang, aren't in mine, so I'm a bit disappointed."
5,Wonderful Pastiches!,"Most Sherlockian pastiches fall far short of the stores written by Conan Doyle, but Rick Boyer has produced some wonderfully entertaining stories in this compilation. We find the Sherlock Holmes and James H. Watson of the Canon, not some pale shadows of those characters. Boyer's style is rich and keeps the reader's interest from first to last. I highly recommend this book to all fans of The Great Detective!"
4,be my baby for a little while --,"saw these boys open for detroit soul legend nathaniel mayer up here in the cold north at the legendary horseshoe tavern -- they blew the lid off the place -- never heard of them before the show, but from here on in will be following closely. hopefully these southern boys make it back up here someday. straight up rock n' roll, no BS. the way it should be."
1,Not What I was Expecting,"I have previously read two James Dobson books - ""Dare to Discipline"" and ""The Strong-Willed Child"", both of which were terrific books. I was expecting the same from ""Love Must Be Tough"" and ""Straight Talk"". I was disappointed. The book is not nearly as readable as his other books, and doesn't get straight to the help you might be needing. It couldn't hold my concentration because it was constantly either going off on a bunny trail or going into story about someone else. It was just all over the place in my opinion. Having said that.... I still have the utmost respect for James Dobson and what Focus on the Family and his organizations have done for our country."
1,are you kidding?,This book blows. If you really want to know what it's like to wait table or how to effectively wait tables...go to clamchowder.biz and buy clam chowder: the server's field manual.
4,An Interesting Read,"A very interesting and entertaining read. Could be adapted into a very good movie involving intrigue and romance.This novel is based on a situation in which the body found in the Berlin bunker was not Hitler, but a substitue placed there in an attempt to dupe the Allies at the end of the European war in 1945.The book deals with a plot to smuggle Hitler out of Germany. McGuire, who was a soldier with the occupational forces in 1945, weaves a very interesting tale of what might have happened in this conspiracy. Interspersed in the plot is a passonate love story between a dashing U.S. Army officer and the attractive wife of one of the conspirators.This book is very well written, and I intend to keep an eye open for future works by this author."
4,great for a younger person,I love the look of these earrings. I will probably give as a gift to one of my younger nieces.The sale price clinched the purchase for me.
4,A lid for every pot,I recommend this lid to anyone who has the related heavy duty Rubbermaid container. It fits well enough to keep rain and rodents out but may blow off in a hurricane. Came well packed and shipped well. Good enough for government work.
5,Spanish Bilingual Bible,This is a great Bilingual Bible. The Spanish and English texts are side by side. This makes word and phrase comparison easy. The only thing that would make it better would be if reference tags for the verses were included.
4,Buenisima!,"EL contenido de la biblia esta muy bien, pero la cubierta es de carton, parese ser de piel pero es de carton.Great bible for what its for to READ! awesome product good for its price conpared to other pricier products!"
5,The best resource I've ever used overseas.,"As a Fundamental Baptist preacher, I have worn out two of these and am purchasing my third. I live in an area that has a large Hispanic population. I used to travel to Central and South America where it was invaluable. I have a South American friend who loves this Bible as well. Even if a person knows very little spanish, he can witness the gospel to those who do by locating the passages in english and letting the Spanish person read them in his or her own language. AMEN!"
4,Muy Bien Santa Biblia,"I bought this bible for my Chilean boyfriend as a gift and he absolutely loves it. He takes it to church each week and finds it very helpful while the Pastor preaches (in English). He prefers to take this one over the NKJV slimline bible that I bought him, even though he really loves that one too. I think the idea of a bilingual bible set up this way is just fantastic for people who have another first language as well as speaking English. The only comment he has made that wasn't positive is that it is KJV in English, not NKJV. Other than that, he is very happy with it. I'm so glad I came across this, a great gift idea."
3,Good for Beginner,"I really like Kathy's detailed description of how to use your ab muscles and breathe while doing Pilates. But I prefer a longer video-this one is is less than 30 minutes and she talks for a good part of it. It also was less intense than I would have liked. I would have liked a section on Advanced Pilates moves, and this video only features Beginning/Intermediate Pilates. It's not a video that someone already in shape or someone used to doing abdominal work will find challenging."
4,"Good for beginners, too slow for the rest","Kathy goes carefully through the exact positioning and moves in a manner that is great for beginners, but for the rest of us it is too slow to get a really good workout. For a better workout once you get the positioning and the moves down, go to Denise Austin."
2,Very disappointed....,"I usually love Kathy's workouts, but this one is just too short, easy and more geared for beginners. It almost seemed like a warm-up and then it's over. There are better Pilates DVDs out there. (Try Jennifer Kries Pilates Method for a true workout!) I prefer workout DVDs that also give more for your money, like 2 workouts on one. This one could have been combined with her equally short Pilates for the Lower Body."
1,Stricly for Beginners,"This was very basic, the teaser is done with feet on the floor or the advanced version with one leg up. Once you get past the beginning instructions, it's only about 20 minutes long so I'll use it if I'm crunched for time. She gives very detailed instructions at the beginning that would benefit beginners. My first Pilates tape was Method Precision Toning still the best in my opinion, followed by Living Arts Mat Based Workout for Intermediates and Karen Voight's Body Reform Abs and Back."
3,Only Ok,Kathy Smith's pilates for Abs is only ok. There is not much information on how to do each exercise or what to do when you cannot do it fully. I was unable to do most of the exercises completely and there was no support for that scenario. There should have been more reps because the chances that someone will do those moves 100% correctly each time are slim. Also the DVD is uninspiring and I will be selling mine soon.A good effort but not fit for beginners..
4,Great workout!,... I LOVED THIS VIDEO!! Kathy really knows how to instruct on proper form. I have found that the better my form becomes the more intense this workout gets. THANKS KATHY!!!
2,Still too difficult for a beginning exerciser new to Pilates,"As opposed to other reviewers I found this very difficult to follow and do. I would pick a class with hands on instruction instead I think. Usually, with Kathy's other videos I have had no problem following along -- I love her functionally fit lower and upper body workouts, her kickboxing video, her timesaver weights and cardio routines etc. All of those were wonderful and posed no special challenge. I could do pretty much every move by try two and absolutely everything after a week or so. I found it impossible to follow this one though despite two tries. Probably better to try pilates if you are an advanced exerciser. And p.s. I have tried the Method videos and I like Kathy much better since she is so motivational."
3,Negative Reveiws are true,"I really should have taken the negative customer reviews more seriously before buying this tape. I believe some moves are well targeted to the abs while others are just too difficult, not to mention unsafe (the roll ups can easily cause injuries to your spine if you do not do them properly or if you're not on a cushioned enough mat or carpet). I also do not like the fact that she does not stretch at the end of the workout. I bought this tape along w/her ""Pilates for the lower body workout"" and I must say the latter is much better. Sadly, she uses the same Intro almost word for word."
1,There's Better Out There,"The best part of this video was the beginning on how Pilates was started and the key elements. I did learn from it, but after hearing it once there wasn't anything else for me. I'm new to Pilates. I have a Crunch: Pick Your Spot Pilates DVD which I love. I was looking for something else to alternate with it. Abs is an area I want to focus on so when I saw this video I thought it would be perfect. What a disappointment!!!! I'm glad I didn't start it first or I might of passed on Pilates altogether. I didn't enjoy it at all. In fact I couldn't stand going all the way through it. I shut it off before it was finished. If you want something laid back you might like it. For those who like something more upbeat like myself...pass on it. Go for the ""Crunch"" instead."
2,Ok for a non-certified instructor,Video is fine but doesn't inspire me to continue to use it...I'll keep it for a rainy day.
1,Complete waste of my money!,I have always wanted to try Pilates and I bought this thinking I could work on my abs! Or at least do SOMETHING! This DVD is BLANK! I will be writing to complain IMMEDIATLEY!
3,Good introduction for beginning exerciser,"This video would make an excellent introduction to Pilates for the beginning exerciser. As usual, Kathy explains each movement very well and reminds the exerciser to engage the powerhouse throughout the video. However she spends little time on each movement and the intensity level is very low. As an intermediate/advanced exerciser I did not feel like I got a good workout - way too short in reps and too long in instruction for longterm use to be of benefit."
2,disappointed,"I bought this video thinking that it would a nice compliment to the other pilates videos that I was buying. However, it is just a short, poorly directed video that is parallel to the other videos that are out there. I thought that it would have some other moves that would highly strengthen my abs, however, I bought Hilary Burnett's Pilates Intermediate which is SSOOOOOOOO much better than this tape by Kathy Smith. Hilary shows all of the same moves and more. Plus, Hilary's instructions are more concise and easier to follow than Kathy's, and Hilary's tape is only a few minutes longer. It is well worth your money to just buy Hilary's tapes and leave Kathy's at the store."
4,good beginner workout,"This is a really good abs workout. It is shorter than SMith's other pilates workout for the lower body. I found that the exercises were harder and I was unable to complete the workout the first time. However, I give this workout four stars because it has some of the same ecercises as the Lower Body workout and it is not as long. I simply felt that Kathy Smith's Pilates for the Lower Body was the better video of the two. This works best when used with that workout."
1,Ugly uncomfortable boots!,These boots are very uncomfortable and rigid. You won't be able to bend your ankles (like going up a stair case) and will have to walk like a robot! I had to return these boots because i couldn't walk normal in them!
5,An excellent small dose of Max,"I received this little gem as a gift from my wife. Each story Max tells will touch your heart. This is an excellent book to buy for yourself or for someone you care about. It's an excellent introduction for someone who hasn't read any of Max's books. It's also a great gift for someone who has read some of Max's books but needs some refreshment. In this little volume, you're getting a first class compilation of Max's thoughts on grace, forgiveness, what the cross means, and other weighty spiritual topics in UNDERSTANDABLE, plain language. The one story in the book that touches me each time I read it is the one about the boy buying a puppy. I challenge anyone who is flesh and blood to read it and not get emotional. This little gem has a number of other wonderful stories that will touch your heart. Thanks Max for an excellent little gift that truly brings joy to the receiver."
5,Possibly the best... please give it a chance.,"One of the most moving books I've ever read (next to the Bible). Mr. Lucado was no doubt God-inspired in collaborating these stories from other works into this book. What human mind could relay these thoughts in such touching fashion without the intervention of God Himself? How could anyone reject the gift of salvation after reading this book? Certainly a blessing in my life, I pray many others are touched by this work."
4,"A nice, inspirational read","I bought this as a gift for myself, and this is my first introduction to the adult works of Max Lucado. (I have several of his children's books, and my children and I have thoroughly enjoyed them.) Overall, I found the little essays in this book well-written and inspirational. I would tell myself I would just read ""one or two"" as a nightly devotional, and end up reading five or six! His descriptions of God's grace and love for us are beyond compare. I did, however, find his descriptions of Christ's death on the cross almost too gleefully lurid. I appreciate the need to explain just how much Christ sacrificed for us, but I wonder if perhaps Mr. Lucado goes into too much detail? I definitely would not recommend this book for someone under 16 for that reason. Still, this is a great, inspirational book and a great introduction to Lucado's work."
5,This is a must for any child's home library.,"My 6-year-old daughter just adores this book. We've only had it one day, and I've already read it four times. But I honestly wouldn't mind reading it again. This is really a great children's book, and I am so glad that it is still in print. I would strongly recommend it for any child's home library. It gives children an opportunity to be silly. . . ."
1,The horror...the horror...,"Whoever thought this book was good for children is sorely mistaken. I read it in fourth grade and it gave me nightmares for years. It wasn't funny and it wasn't cute, and it wasn't gross-out awesome. It was just scary and horrifying. I was a huge reader as a kid (still am), and this is far and away the worst and most traumatizing book I read as a child. Please, break the cycle: don't read it to your own children. Surely you love them more than that."
3,This Book Scarred Me,"I remember reading this book when I was about 6 years old and it messed me up something awful. I still have pangs of anxiety upon seeing the cover.On the other hand, reading it now, it is pretty entertaining :D"
1,Nightmares?,"Wanna give your three year old nightmares and a life long slug phobia? Read em this book and your sure to do so. I'm sure older kids may find this book amusing but I certainly did not. I understand the gross humor that a 10 year old boy might get out of this but, telling kids that at night they will come and ""chop you into pancakes and turn you brain to sauerkraut"" is plain evil. I'm glad I managed to stop reading and just made up an ending that didn't have to do with murdering my child."
1,Not for young children,"I bought this book for my 4-soon to be 5 year old son who adores slugs and snails. The illustrations are cute with very funny facial expressions on many of the slugs. The storyline is unamusing at first then horrifying at the end. It begins with slugs being cooked and served as food (no big deal) then slugs put into blenders etc. At the end the slugs seek revenge and tear a man apart and put him in a trash can. At the end my son asked worriedly, ""Are you going to tear me up and put me in a trash can?"". One star is the lowest rating they allow so thats what it gets."
2,Fairly fragile,"It's ok, overprice for injection molded plastic. The vendor I used took almost 3 weeks to deliver it."
2,Sudden Unexplained Collapse,"A plastic pin sheared off causing the workload to drop to the ground. Fortunately, no one was hurt. I would not believe the 1000 lbs rating on these sawhorse.For lightduty work, these are probably fine."
3,great for beginning therapists.,This book does a great job at outlining some of the most widely used evidence-based practices. The way the book is organized was also user friendly. I found that I did not need to read it in it's entirety to understand the various therapies. The book also does a good job at referencing relevant and recent research.
4,Missing some crucial evidenced based therapies.,"This books is useful for gaining an introductory understanding to some of the approaches that have been researched and found useful for children and adolescents. My primary concern is the bias in this book toward cognitive behavioral and/or behavioral approaches only. Included in this text are a few approaches that admittedly have limited data to support them to date. These limitations are appropriately noted, but why not include other promising approaches, i.e. play therapy? Filial therapy is one model, a play therapy based approach, that has had a significant amount of research to support it and it is also not included here."
3,Evidence-Based Psychotherapies for Children and Adolescents,"Is a good book written by Alan E. Kazdin. However we have four childrens of our own and I never needed a book to teach them manners and also to teach them to respect family, friends, and neighbours."
1,Died the first time I used it!,"I had been looking for a crock pot for awhile, and decided this one had all the features I needed. I had read the reviews about a few people having issues with it, but was hoping the company had improved their quality control and worked out the bugs. This was not the case! The crock pot died right in the middle of the first meal I made. Don't take a chance on this unit. The crock is of good quality, but the cooking housing feel cheap and the display is hard to read. And it breaks!"
2,Good until it died prematurely,"I bought my slow cooker about 3 years ago. The pros:- very easy to program- easy to clean - the insert can be washed thoroughly- high heat cooked things fairly efficiently (roughly equal to a slow simmer)- can keep an eye on items cooking through the see-through lid, even with some steam on itThe cons:- A big one - it died after about 12 uses. I only use a slow cooker every few months. When I went to use it today, the unit turned on, but the heating element is apparently no longer working. So for other users - don't assume it is fine just because the LED display is working.- the slow setting was a bit too low - items took far too long to cook (even items supposed to cook in 8 hours didn't). I didn't remove the lid either - it just seemed too low.I don't think I will buy another one of these - I would have expected a much longer life."
5,Saves my life every other day... love this slow cooker,"I can't live without it. I have three men in my house that eat unbelievably huge amounts of food, toddler boys that eat like men. My husband, well, eating machine.I have a bad back and cannot stand long nor bend much. A friend of mine suggested a slow cooker. It cooks slow and fast. I can take frozen chicken thighs and make a full, healthy meal in about 5 hours. I am amazed I did not discover this sooner and really can't live without it now. I can make very large quantities of food and basically go about my day doing whatever needs to be done and not worry.I have very little time so this is a welcome addition to my home. I just love it. I could probably have bought a ""brand name very expensive"" slow cooker. Instead I did a lot of research and found this one to be perfect for me. I am happy and the price is definitely right."
1,Didn't last long,We used this slow cooker to cook up probably four or five batches of chili over the last year or so....Plugged it in the other day and nothing....Dead......Buy something else. This one is not worth the money.
1,Mine died too,"This was a great slow cooker until it, too, died after less than two months. I think I'll go for a less ""evolved"" but more reliable version if I can't find my receipt and get this one replaced. A pile of cold uncooked meat (when the cooker cheerfully stated it was cooking!) when you get home after ten hours with three hungry kids is just not worth it."
4,Set it and forget it,"Ive only used it twice and it's fabulous. I've made pernil and beef stew. I'm Latin and we love our food with flavor. This gadget does not compromise that. Just season as normal and it will turn out delicious and tender. Meat will melt in your mouth. I'm a working mom so it's a life saver. I season my meat the night before and in the morning just pop it in cooker, set timer and I'm out the door. I also leave my rice cooking in the rice cooker. It's nice to come home after a long day with two hungry and cranky toddlers to a home cooked meal ready to be served. Worth the investment."
2,Doesn't last,"We use a slow cooker a lot. Sometimes 3 times a week. We don't expect them to last forever when used so much, but In the past we have gotten 5-7 years from each Crock-pot brand one we've owned. We went through TWO of this Hamilton Beach model in 18 months :(Luckily the first was still under warranty, still a hassle.Pick a more reliable brand, I'm off to choose a new one for our family, we can't be without it!"
3,Disappointing end to two-year run,"We purchased this slow cooker in May 2010 and used it 3-4 times a week for a wide variety of delicious meals. It worked flawlessly until last week when we came home and found partially cooked meatballs. At first, I thought I had selected the ""warm"" instead of ""low"" setting, but two days later, I had the same issue. My husband took the base apart and noticed a wire had become disconnected. He resoldered it and we got two more meals out of it. Today, it stopped working partway through the cycle and although the timer continued to run down, the heating element was clearly dead. Overall, this crock is well designed and quite useful with the self-timing feature, but evidently not a reliable, lasting purchase. It also does not have a means of securing the lid for travel. ... I would put my money elsewhere until the reliability issues are fixed."
4,Just what we where looking for,Being away from home 12hrs makes it hard to have a cooked meal at night. With the Hamilton Beach Programmable Slow Cooker it's cooked and kept warm when we get home.
2,Overcooks and dries out everything,"I got this cooker specifically for the settings and the probe. I've used it probably 15 times in the last 2 months and it has overcooked everything I've made in it except for soups. I think the temps for the ""low"" and ""high"" settings are off (like the ""low"" settings is actually ""high"" temp?) or it is turning itself to low or high as other reviewers have mentioned. The lid has a hole for the probe, but if you aren't using it, it just becomes a hole for the steam (and therefore liquid) to escape. I used my old crock pot lid (that fits) and it still overcooked and dried out my food. Don't buy this crock pot! I'm going back to using my old one."
1,Shuts off completely in manual mode,I used this with great success for a year and all of a sudden it keeps shutting off during manual mode.
1,Made in China=dead on second use,"I now have a beautiful buffalo stew cooking in the oven on an 85 degree day. NOT happy. Oh, and customer service is only around until 3:30 central time. That's 1:30 out west in case you're thinking of buying one out there. Not exactly customer friendly. Big surprise, it's made in China."
1,Not happy,"It is NOT programmable. It doesn't allow you to tell it when to start - which is what I want to be a programmable item. It also wobbles, which is aggravating. I would have returned it but the shipper would not pay for the return label! Very unhappy with this product and the shipper of this product!!!!!"
2,The lid doesn't fit the pot!,"I never turned this product on to realize it wasn't right for me. The lid doesn't fit the pot! Most pots have a lid that will fit the pot snugly and not move around. This is needed to keep the heat and moisture in the pot and not let it escape.Not so with this pot! Once you have the lid in place, it can be rotated at least a 1/2 inch in each direction around the top of the pot. (This is an oval lid) Doing so you can easily create small holes for the heat/moisture to rapidly escape. There also isn't any indication by a snug fit that you even have the lid on the correct place to begin with.Do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this slow cooker!"
1,NOT For Shabbat Use,"I own and love a smaller manual HB crockpot that I regularly use to keep meatballs warm for the kids to eat for Shabbos lunch. When I decided to buy a second crockpot for cholent or soup, I decided to go with a fancier HB.What a mistake.This sucker turns itself off after 14 hours. That's it. No way to get around it, according to the item buried in the manual. Of course, I only found out when I found the crockpot off and my cholent rapidly cooling on Shabbat morning.Don't make my mistake."
5,"Finally, the perfect slow cooker!","I LOVE this slow cooker. The meat probe means I can make a roast that can be medium or medium well, not nessecarily cooked to a lump o mush. I love that you can cook on ""manual"" mode like a traditiona slow cooder, or you can use the timer and once the time is up it will automatically keep the food warm on warming mode, or you can set a temperature for doneness for the meat probe and then the slow cooker will switch to keep warm. Doens't cook overly hot and is able to cook perfectly even when the crock is only half or 3/4 full."
3,Great slow cooker Dead on third use!,"I was absolutely in love with this slow cooker for the two weeks that I've had it. This was going to change my life! I cooked a gorgeous beef roast for an unhurried evening meal, made overnight oatmeal for a relaxed breakfast and decided to use it for a stew today. I'm expecting 4 overnight guests and the thing is DEAD! It won't power up! I plugged it in 3 different outlets and even called customer service hoping there was some fancy reset button I had missed. Well, I guess once in a while the programmable ones turn up faulty - I'm quoting the customer service person here. So, I have a stew bubbling away merrily on my stove and am a few hours behind on getting ready for this evening. But. . . .having said all that - when I return this baby to Costco (sorry Amazon) I'm going to turn right around and get the same model once more to give it another chance."
1,This crock is cracked!,"The crock insert in my pot developed a long crack that went all the way across and through the bottom. I did a little Internet research and found that MANY other people had had the same problem. When I called the company, Hamilton Beach's customer service was not only unhelpful, they were downright hostile and were completely unconcerned about this possible safety issue."
2,lasted 1 year then boom...,"I loved this crock pot except for a few complaints. The settings will only last for 8 hours. I could never figure out how to get it to go to warm after the timer goes off. The whole for the probe constantly leaks moisture out, thus lengthening cooking time. Last night the lid shattered on me. See my photo. Naturally the warranty does not cover the lid since it is glass."
2,Great... until it broke,"This was a very good slow cooker, and I imagine it would continue to be a good one if I could replace the ceramic insert. I only used it a few times before it broke. I don't understand why it would have broken. I allowed the insert to cool and hand washed it. While I was drying it, it just snapped. I've tried contacting Hamilton Beach to see if I could buy a replacement, but they never got back to me."
1,Pure Crap,I got this for Christmas 2010. I have used it 2 times. Pulled her out yesterday to make stock for bean soup and presto the damn thing won't power up. I guess you get what you pay for. It's back to a real crock pot for me.
1,electronics defective on third use,"I overlooked some of the negative reviews as it seems every slow cooker has some negative reviews. I guess I overlooked the wrong ones.I made two nice dishes with my slow cooker, on the third try the electronic controls no longer functioned. I am pretty disappointed, on top of the $45 dollars spent on the slow cooker I had to throw away $20 worth of cooking ingredients.Don't make the mistake I did, don't buy a slow cooker from Hamilton Beach."
5,Love at First Bite,"I'd had my heart set on a red Rival Manual Crock-pot. ($19.99)(* Note: in feng shui, red in the kitchen = security & abundance)But when I got to Target, I found this Hamilton Beach Programmable with the probe for the INCREDIBLE price of $31.50.That's 20 dollars OFF!I bought it Saturday 9/19/2009 then made chicken teriyaki the next day (frozen thighs, 5.5 hours on high (unfrozen would be 4 hours).The chicken came out great!Yesterday afternoon I made Forbidden Rice Pudding with coconut milk & rice milk (4 hours on low).P.S. I'm putting a red vinyl tablecloth beneath my everyday kitchen table cloth to fire up the feng shui instead.My mom says it's the best batch EVAR.Am delighted!"
5,Snoopy's Adventures,Snoopy? Charlie Brown? The gang? What's not to like?? Simple messages but always a deeper truth. Kids enjoy watching it for the entertainment while adults notice the subtle message. Always a joy to watch!
5,This Gets 5 Stars For One Reason,"Ordinarily, when reviewing a 10-track CD with neither liner notes nor discography, I would seldom go higher than 3 stars. But this one from BMG in 1997 is an exception simply for the inclusion of three songs that are extremely hard to find in their original format.The 1955 renditions of The Ballad Of Davey Crockett by Bill Hayes (# 1), ""Tennessee"" Ernie Ford (# 5), and Fess Parker (# 5) are relatively easy to find on numerous compilations, but this one by the composer of the Dragnet theme, which hit # 14 in 1955 billed to The Voices Of Walter Schumann, just does not appear to be available anywhere else.The same can be said for Vaughn Monroe's Black Denim Trousers And Motorcycle Boots, which made it to # 38 in late 1955, and Love Me Tender by Henri Rene & His Orchestra (# 44 in late 1956/early 1957).The sound quality is excellent."
3,Boring and not informative enough,"Worst of both worlds - claims to be anecdotal to get around having to have too much actual information (other than the more boring parts of the history of the American textile industry, but trades in interesting anecdotes for general suppositions and a couple sucess stories.The last section is very cool and interesting and saves this book from the bin. If you get it, skip to the end."
5,"Amazing book, great instructional guide for all TSD practitioners","I began studying Tang Soo Do (Soo Bahk Do) in 2007 in Osan, Korea. After I earned my first Dan I ran across this book, and decided to purchase it even though it is an older book. I was very impressed with it. Even as an Il Dan, on forms I know like the back of my hand, this book has brought a new and greater understanding. The author (and former Grand Master) goes into great detail on each technique, on every move of every form, and provides pictures and sketches for reference on both proper and improper form and technique. I hope someday I am able to find the other four volumes of this set, as I am sure they are all equally well written. I highly recommend this book for any serious Tang Soo Do practitioner."
4,Good photovoltaic resource,"This book was a required textbook for a solar energy class that I took. Normally, I would sell a book after taking a class, but this one I decided to keep because it has a lot of good information on photovoltaics and how they work, on a very technical level, without being too dry and boring. It is a relatively easy read, considering that it is technical information.The book does NOT cover any solar thermal applications. You will need to find this information elsewhere."
1,No shipping status,I was promised shipping information when I purchased the book. I spent additional money to upgrade the delivery for faster delivery and a tracking number. I never did get a tracking number. The supplier was slow to respond to my question on shipping. I received an answer as to whether the book was shipped two days after the book arrived.
3,Good for the price for plus sizes recommend ordering 2 sizes larger for colored briefs,Good product but as one review I read said the colored briefs ARE cut smaller. I was good to go because I ordered 2 sizes up above my size. But hey the price was right and I could get MY size being one of those BIG BEAUTIFUL ladies.
5,Brief on Briefs,"They are a good fit, They are a good quality, would recommend these and buy them again. They wash very well."
1,One image is for a 5 pack and the writing says 3 pack,I don't know why it is allowed for the description of the item to be different from the picture on items for sale. A large picture is for a 5 pack of panties and the small decription says 3 pack. Very deceiving. Sometimes it is hard to figure exactly what you are getting on Amazon.
2,woops!,"I should have ordered the white ones. I have bought assorted colors and prints in the store .. where I could see them. Nice pastels like in the pictures. I never imagined that anyone would make these in bright vivid large polkadot and electric colors. They look like clown pants... lol. I can't where them with anything without them showing through. I'ed advise you order white.... unless you like to reeeeeally walk on the wild side!! Just my size is a great product and they are the best britches I have ever bought for comfort and fit and they don't shrink up two sizes like others I have bought and they last for a ling time. they don't fall apart or the elastic shred. just... whew... shouldn't make those awful colors or they should say that you are going to get bright ... or pastel colors before you buy.. and not just get.""assorted"" colors of their choosing."
5,Wonderful panty,"These are great, comfortable, true to size, sturdy and long lasting panties. Well worth the price. I just wish they had them in size 8."
5,JMS underwear,As always with JMS they are great quality. I've been buying them for years and have always been totally happy with my purchases.
2,Cotton briefs,"These fit well at the waist but are skimpy between the legs, too thong like for a good fitting brief. The larger sized briefs should have been designed to fit as the photo shows. They don't."
1,JMS Cotton Briefs,"Ugh! What a disappointment. Been wearing only JMS briefs for years. These are terrible. The packaging didn't look like regular JMS packaging; they don't have the JMS logo on the waistband; the material is thin; the waistband is less substantial; butt cheeks hang out; and they're sized at LEAST one size too small. I don't know if there's a market for counterfeit underwear or JMS has thrown quality out the window for profit. (Also: product description says 3-pack, but it's a 5-pack; which seemed like a plus at first; but now I'm stuck with 10 pairs of underwear I can't wear). Very disappointed."
2,cheap fabric,I've purchased JMS briefs before and the quality has always been superior to all other cotton briefs but sadly not this time. The material was thin and waist band didn't seem to have much elasticity in it. I know I will not buy these from Amazon again.
2,Incomplete soundtrack!,"what a disappointment this soundtrack was for me! the best song called ""After"" from band called ""Wide Open Cage"" wasn't on this this soundtrack, and now i know that the song i was looking for was from WOC. i would have thought that original sountrack includes ALL the songs and not just missing the best one! how silly. only thing now to comfort is that Tricky's song was pretty good too..."
4,Songs range from West African Ghanan music to American gospe,"Slow drums and slow romance open JOURNEY with 'Jenny', where the singer laments Jenny's departure - then moves into wide-ranging grooves.The goal in JOURNEY is to expose the world to Jabali Africa authentic tunes (Jabali being a rock): thus 'Jenny''s romance evolves into the even more rhythmic beats of 'Tubula', a tribute to Joseck Asikoye's mother.JOURNEY is most powerful when all the polyrhythms stop completely, as in the third song 'Magunga''s introduction.Jabali Afrika doesn't rest on East African laurels and traditions alone, here: their songs range from West African Ghanan music to American gospel - and it's the group vocals which shine in JOURNEY."
4,Difficult for Males to Watch Without Drooling!!,"My wife got this to exercise to, and I can't watch this woman in her stretchy pants...sheeesh! I get too distracted by her pelvic movements to be able to watch her movements for the sake of exercise! I GUESS it's good for working out, though!"
2,Use only if you have good coordination!,"I couldn't keep up with all the steps and had a tough time following it. I think if you tried it over and over and over, you might get it. It was very fast-paced and quick. Probably a good workout for the right person, but not for everyone."
4,"Good, but...","I started out really liking the workout. Over time, I've lost interest. It's a little too repetitive in that you do the same steps over and over (though they do vary the arms.) Plus, some of the steps in the jazz section are a bit fast for me. Basically, it is not my favorite workout DVD, but it provides variety and is somewhat fun."
3,Dance for those not in great shape & uncoordinated,"Others have written great reviews... I just watched the first 10-15 min of this streaming from rental giant ntflx. I'll just add the moves a very simple & almost silly they are so old, there's even bunny hops in it. The only complex move is a hip circle as you walk sideways, the only other cool move is a double hip bump. There are some mambos, grapevines, etc. There's a double lunge which is popular on dance floor that looks hot, but with these women, it only looks like aerobics. If you like decent music & real dancers, avoid this. If you like something easy & not intimidating to get you started, you'll love this.Preview at collagevideo com"
4,Not for everyone,"I have a bad back and was looking for a gentle workout I could do in short intervals because of frequent interruptions at home. I would say this video fufills the need to get you moving without too much challenge or time commitment. You may not have to be as careful not to hurt yourself as you might using a standard fitness video if you have fitness restrictions. However, it kind of tries too hard to be fun and I didn't find Michelle Dozois to be very charismatic. My daughter thought it was boring and for old ladies, which it probably is, but it suits some of us fine."
2,Wow JAWS is a cyborg!!,The 7th and not the last installment of the Gamera Series.Note:People say this is the last series but they all forgot about the 8th one Super Monster Gamera OOP hard to find Gamera flick but also was bad.Gamera is battling a jaws lookingcyborg that came from a planet to take over the earth.But as you can tell in all Kajiu films that not going to happen.The kids in here are very annoying i mean VERY ANNOYING!!!The monster action was not great and they should came up something better then this.Overal its alright but i would own just to have if you are kajiu film collector or such.
1,Not a bad Gamera flick if you are 5 years old,"First let me say that I love gamera. He is right up there with Godzilla. But this movie is almost unwatchable. The plot, acting, and songs are all geared for a small child; and I mean small. A 10 year old would find it stupid. Zigra is one of the worst villains in any campy monster movie. He is a flimsy rubber shark with legs that tries to conquer the world by holding a submarine with 2 kids and their fathers hostage. Enough said. Buy it only if you want to complete your Gamera collection, but don't watch it."
2,Gamera fights an extra-terrestrial fish,"Zigra, a shark-like creature from another planet, comes to conquer Earth. It causes monstrous earthquakes to prove its power and then demands the people of earth to surrender to him. We fight back of course but are no match for Zigra's goofy powers. With the help of a couple of marine biologists, Gamera saves the day in the end, winning yet another monster steel cage match. As with all Gamera movies there are two annoying children, dumb adults and poor special effects. The story is ok but plays out kind of boring. The original Gamera was a pretty good monster movie but as the series went on they just got goofier and goofier. Most memorable scene? Two grown men arguing over who's going to buy the last fish at a seafood market. It goes on and on and has nothing to do with the rest of the film. Genius."
3,hmmm....,"its a cute bag, but didnt think it was quite that small. defintely not a bag you would use for school. great compartments just wish it was large enough to hold more than a cell phone and maybe wallet."
5,excellant buy,excellant compass. Real adjustments for declination by set screw and tool attached to the lanyard. Feels solid. Rubber buttons to help grip on the map. Highly recommend
2,disappointing,"I bought this movie because i saw Song il-kook in Jumong and am a very big fan. I was very disappointed in the ""silly"" plot line. He also was not that believable as a ""playboy"". He was much better in Jumong and Emperor of the Sea."
4,"Nice looking but not practical (duh, I should have known that right?)","I wanted something on my table that had the look of Nature and had some texture. These fit the bill but they're really not practical to eat off--or at least not on a daily basis. My husband and I are messy eaters and we tend to splatter stuff off our plates and onto the place mats. Being made as they are, they're not that easy to clean. Also, your plate will not be on a perfectly flat surface which means it will roll around a bit while you're eating."
5,fun and educational,these little stuffed animals allow children to use the computer and get to the webkinz site. it teaches them responsibility and other fun activities.
3,A learning experience.,I bought this for my daughter thinking I would add to her Webkins collection. Well little did I know that the codes expire and all you are buying is a cute stuffed animal. I didn't spend much on it and boy am I glad. My daughter was disappointed but I told her that it was just a learning experience for us both. Learn from my mistake.
4,"Great pot, great price","This pot is my workhorse. I make beer, wine, and maple syrup with it. It is not a very heavy duty pot, but is good enough to do what you need to do. Mine has a couple of dents, but is fine. Great pot I highly recommend it."
1,Not as described,"The description of this product is incorrect. It is not a fryer/steamer. It is just a 36 qt. stock pot. It does not have the fryer/steaming basket. I thought it was missing from my original order so I reordered it only to find out the second did not have a fryer/steaming basket either. When I contacted CS I was told they caught the error after receiving other phone calls and changed the description. The return process was easy, but I had to scramble for an alternative product for a large party I was having two days later."
5,Awesome home brew kettle,"This works great for five gallon, all-grain brewing. Nicely made pot, and definitely the best one for the money you'll find anywhere."
5,Fantastic brew kettle,"I bought this to do home brewing beer. The build quality is fantastic. It's solid and the capacity is perfect for my purposes. The stainless is easy to clean and very durable. If you're looking for a great brew kettle, this would be a good choice."
1,Disappointed,"Reading reviews on this pot gave me hope that I too could purchase a good brewpot on the cheap. The first pot shipped ended up with pitting on the pot's interior that extended though the ultra-thin stainless steel cladding. As a result, oxidation was evident; not ideal for brewing. Okay, maybe it was just a factory defect. It happens. Asked for a replacement ,which arrived in 3 days-FAST, only to find that the bottom was warped and would not sit flatly on the stove's heating element. Not good. In short, you can get a cheap pot quickly, but quality suffers. If you do not plan on brewing beer and are using a gas burner, then this pot should work just fine. If you plan on boiling wort with this pot, save up your money for a higher quality product."
3,Maybe my cat has a short attention span,"I've had these for about a month now and the cat has lost interest in these mice, but they were so cheap I'm not too worried. When they first arrived he had a great time with them, he bit them, licked them and boxed them with his hind legs. It was very amusing to watch him try and kill them. They are still intact, so I suppose they are of good quality."
3,Decent mouse toy.,"I guess this toy mouse does its job, but as many other posters had said the potency of the catnip leaves something to be desired. At least I think so. If I pour the catnip into the mouse pouch and hold it open my cat will dig it's head in there and go crazy, so I know she can smell it. However, once I press the pouch closed she seems to lose interest in it quickly."
4,Kittens love to play!,I bought this for a gift for my daughter's kittens. They love the action in it as they love to play.
5,One of the best software design book,"Finally, a book that covers software design from a .NET developer perspective.While the book make an extensive use of Microsoft tools (Visual Studio and Visio), the authors offer an uncompromising and clear material.Clearly written for seasoned developers, the books still offers novice programers a good primer on OO programing."
2,Better once out there,"I found Developing .NET Enterprise Applications book better than this one.I personally bought the book for MSF and authors have let me down on this topic. They have only small description of definitions and nothing explained from applications point of view. All textual. Typical MSDN documetation.On top of that, I noticed graphics are copy and paste from Microsoft documetation."
2,Not as good as contents seems...,I preordered it months ago and after a long wait I finally got it. It is not the book I wanted based on the contents and title promised. You many see familiar things if you have already digged MSDN documentation.
4,"Super quiet, installation not quite straightforward","This fan was a huge upgrade from our old and loud bathroom fan (4 sones+). I installed it along with a Leviton timer, and it is a good thing, because it is difficult to hear it running. Incredibly quiet. The only problem was installation. The fan is designed to mount to 2x6s maximum with 18 inch enters max. My ceiling had 2x4s that were part of trusses at 24 inch centers. Instructions did not cover this case, and the included parts to not span 24 inches and the fan does not snug up against an existing 2x4 if the drywall is already installed. The proper solution seems to be a 2x6 subframe specifically for mounting the fan, which was a bit overkill. But my guess is that this fan will work great for most installations.timer used:Leviton LTB60-1LZ Decora Preset 10/20/30/60 Minute Countdown Timer Switch, Neutral Required, White Assembled On Device, Ivory And Light Almond Included"
3,Panasonic FV-05VF2,Very quiet and easy to install. Not quite powerful enough for my quite small bathroom 8x5. Bought the 80 for the other bath and it works great.
1,"Looks Nice, Quiet BUT Very Little Suction and Power","I've always had good luck with Panasonic products but I bought this for a small 7' x 5' bathroom and it barely pulls the moisture out of the room when showering. You have to leave the door cracked and even then its not guaranteed that the mirror and wall art won't get steamy. Wouldn't buy this brand bathroom fan again, quite surprised and disappointed."
2,"Quiet, but doesnt work properly","First thngs first, this fan is very quite. Which is great. However, it does not seem to be strong enough. We have a very small bathroom with a walk in shower and our walls are constantly full of condensation even with this thing running at all times and a bathroom window open. Im going to have my husband check again just to ensure it is installed correctly. Chances are that we will have to remove it and purchase something that is louder, but more powerful."
4,Panasonic FV-05VF2,"It is a quiet fan, but not silent by any stretch. This unit has a >slight< rattle. It isn't bad enough for me to disassemble the install and return it. The could have designed it with a snap-off bottom flange on two sides. That would have benefited me when I installed it then framed around the fan. Deduct one star due to the rattle. I would buy another or similar Panasonic model."
4,Foreign-made product works well,"Just began using this item for 1/2"" PEX. I had to calibrate it out of the box, but that was simple. I had just one ring during my install that didn't 'feel' right when I crimped it and sure enough that was the only leaker I had. In other words, it is easy to get a feel for good/bad crimps with this easy to use tool once calibrated. Only complaint w/ the package is you get a ""go"" gauge, but not a ""no-go"" gauge like some other packages. It's 14"" length can get you into trouble (but nice for the leverage it creates). I couldn't open up the tool wide enough when crimping a ring for a pedestal sink that was near the wall corner. Plan ahead and you can avoid this inconvenience."
1,Bad item,"I already sent an e-mail about this item that you must not have gotten. The handles on this item are locked in place at the device that should allow tightening. Both handles slip around the shaft. The tightening nut and bolt were shaved off at the manufacturing location, causing for the nut not to turn on the bolt as is necessary.I contacted the shipper in Rocklin Ca about it. He said to call the vendor in Brooklyn NY. I did and was told to ship it back to Brooklyn at my expense. I got it shipped to me from Ace Hardware in Rocklin. The UPS store told me it would cost $60 to ship it to Brooklyn. I chose not to. My next step was going to be to call my Visa folks and see if they can reverse the charges. The fellow I talked to in Rocklin told me that he checked all the other scythe's in stock and all of them were ruined the same way. Please solve this for me."
1,Terrible do not buy,I have now red the previous reviews of the item so i guess i have myself to blame. Handles do not turn as tey supposed and you can not change or tighten them. Can not be used in the state it had been shipped. Screws from the handles had been shaved off. It is not usable
4,Another Great Mississippi Artist,"I love this CD. I would love to see the radio stations more receptive to new and local artist, like Chad. When I call to request Chad the radio stations refuse to play him even in Jackson at Miss 103 because he is not on a major label. Good luck to Chad from another Mississippian."
5,Hummingbirds Over Flora,"Flora has been gone from my life many, many years. Now she is back with a pristine performance of Dindi, the best I ever heard in 40yrs of bossa novism I carry so far... Flora is no butterfly, she is a hummingbird. GF"
3,Slightly more dreaming than flying,"3 1/2An easy record to love for its warm, always experimental Brazilian fusion, Purim is nonetheless one of those artists creating consistently compelling output without being able to close a totally solid release when indulgences impede on a short running time."
2,there were many over indulgences in the 70's,"... earth muffinish philosophies translated into boring music were some of the least harmful. this is a good example. maybe 1.5 tunes on this album are worth listening to more than once. in fairness, the same could be said for many artists and albums of this genre."
4,STEVE,WHAT CAN I SAY--STEVE ALLEN IS BRILLIANT AND HIS SHOWS WILL ALWAYS BE ICONIC. HE WAS A GENIOUS AS AN ENTERTAINER AND AS AN AUTHOR. MY MOM WAS ON ONE OF HIS SHOWS IN 1958. WE COULDN'T IND IT ON HERE THOUGH.
4,Easy & intuitive to connect. Great for extending your IR remote signal into closed cabinets,"You do need a IR signal sensor that's not included in this kit. Read Xantech's own website to find the sensor most suitable to your application, then buy it here on Amazon. (Xantech doesn't direct-sell from their website anyway.)LCD and Plasma TVs do give out a lot of IR noise. So the right sensor selection and placement is needed. (Otherwise the ""noise"" is louder than your remote signal, and saturates the relay station.)"
4,gladly it's not too religiously pested,"i watched the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it even it was a lukewarm movie with a very slow pace. the movie itself showed the state of georgia like a vacuumed bubble without anything but courtroom, almost empty prison, beautiful scenery, nice lawns and houses, even the cemetery looked nice, not too much traffic or too many pedestrians. i also found out that there was not too much propaganda of the christian stuff putting everything related to god, and that's really good."
5,Excellent book!,"Whitlow is a wonderful author and this book is no exception. Legal drama, mystery, romance, and redemption. Don't miss it!"
4,Pretty Good,"Overlooking the handful of typos and the predictablity of the story, I give ""The Trial"" 4 stars. This was the first trial in a narrative that I did not find monotonous but quite interesting. Despite the evidence, I was somewhat (but not totally) surprised by the verdict. Keep in mind that the story line was predictable.The author uses quite a bit of ""fluff"", describing what the characters had for lunch, directions to certain locations, etc. If that doesn't bother you, give this book a try."
4,God in the Court room ?,"The suspenseful style & thriller of John Grisham makes this book a good read. It keeps you on the edge of your chair and quickly turning pages well into the night time hours. For those who are tired of trashy, vulgar, profain, sexual novels and want a good read that's suitable for everyone this book is a wonderful change. Some of his characters have deep spiritual convictions and it shows that a thriller can be wholesome and very entertaining. Better than ""The List"" his first novel.Trusting that this author will continue writing and not let the publishers rush him into writing fast or trashy just to please their book sales and pound out another book for 2002. Mr. Whitlow, Write well and at your own pace. We'll buy it, we'll wait."
3,haven't read it yet,"I really liked ""The List"" and am looking forward to reading ""The Trial"". I like the positive aspects Robert Whitlow brings to his stories."
1,Lost my new cellphone,"This product is connected to the clip via a screw on the back. If your screw comes loose like mine did, you'll lose your cellphone too. Then you'll be screwed as I was."
3,Ok product,"This product is alright. I love the durability of the hard exterior case (saved my phone a few times) and the shock absorption of the neoprene interior. However, the case is annoying in the sense that the bottom of the front cover gets in the way of the top 2 buttons that you use to navigate menus or lock your phone. The phone is also too big to make much use of the belt clip."
5,one of the very great bargains in classical music,The performances in this set are either very good or excellent with the overall quality being on a very high level indeed. Barshai has a great command of Shostakovich's musical language. The liner notes while not overly long are extremely informative and get to the point quickly. The only drawback here is that there no texts for Symphonies 13 and 14 or for a couple of earlier works. You may have your own favorite interpetations of each symphony but don't let that dissuade you from purchasing this fine set. At circa $4 a disc it's like finding that proverbial needle in a haystack.
5,"""Wonderful""","This is easily the best complete set of Shostakovich`s 15 symphonies.Rudolf Barshai/ WDR symphony orchestra give us a completely new and unique account of all the symphonies.Of particular note is a very unique recorded sound, often you will hear nuances such as the vibrating of a particular instrument that brings you back for more repeated listening.Nicely packaged. Imported by ""Qualiton Imports of Distinction""Roy Stevensmusicologist reviews"
2,Incomplete manual,"This manual is like most other car manuals with step by step instructions on how to do most repairs and maintenance on your vehicle. Where this manual falls short is where it has makes references to leaving the job to a professional mechanic. An example of this is chapter 10-8. I purchase these manuals for instruction on how to do the repairs myself. I was totally shocked to see this in this manual. It's quite easy today to rent or even purchase the tools needed to do most jobs. Because of this, I cannot give a higher rating to this manual. I will have to check with Chilton to see if they make this same comment."
4,Average coming from Hive,"Too much tech step/hard step and not enough rollerz and drum oriented tracks. If you want to hear a good mix by Hive, check out his mix for drum n bass arena on [...]."
4,"Raw, Nonconforming, Uncommon.....Powerful!!","Hassan El-Amin makes use of the ultimate case study, his life. The result, a blueprint for self-knowledge and self discovery. The author's notion of the Inner Child and how it influences our adult lives is very compelling. The author's words like a key began to unlock and open the door to my own journey of self-discovery. The book is formatted and edited for an easy read, without all the typical ""bells and whistles"" associated with other books in this genre."
1,Utter garbage,"What a ripoff this book is. I bought it, expecting a lot of player analysis from James, and all it basically is... is a book listing stats... 90% of which can be had online for free, with the remaining few so utterly obscure that they're not even worth worrying about.So then I thought the 2006 projections would be the saving grace of this book, but that whole section again provides no meat. Just blind projections, with no individual explanations. Worse yet, James had nothing to do with these projections... he wasn't even involved, yet they appear in his book as if he was. A bunch of no-namers did the projections, a colossal disappointment.If you bought this book expecting the type of analysis James provided in his ""Historical Baseball Abstract,"" you'll be greatly letdown. I was looking forward to this book's arrival, but within a few minutes, I was thinking... what the hell did I waste my money on this garbage for?"
3,"Stats, Stats, Stats",Great book if you want to know Gerald Williams OBS against LHP in day games. Lots and lots of numbers. But thats it. Great book for the stat dork!
5,Great Stats!,"From the best statistical mind in baseball, a book that covers all the bases and adds in extra innings. I plan to purchase every year!"
5,AMAZING,"This is the original ""SHAM-WOW""! It's a must if you like keeping your metal objects of desire clean and looking good."
2,It doesn't fit,The holes don't fit over the exhaust manifold studs on the head. I had to use a dremmel and wallow out the holes a TON in order to get these to fit.
1,"Bad history, decent cast","""Young Bess"" is proof positive that taking liberties with history is a long, proud Hollywood tradition. I don't mind when history is adjusted to make a better story,(see ""Lady Jane""), but when it changes and makes the story less interesting (see ""Elizabeth"" with Blanchett) as it does with ""Young Bess"", then I do mind.Thomas Seymour comes off as a wise & popular sainted gentleman, rather than the abrasive, scheming charmer he was. Not to mention, his flirtation with Elizabeth, who at 15 was 25 years his junior, is distasteful at best. Elizabeth, rather than try to save Seymour, herself famously remarked, ""This day died a man with much wit and very little judgment.""Simmons seems to think Elizabeth was very angry all the time. Kerr and Granger were fine. Also, I didn't know they had conical Playtex bras in the 1500's. And Simmons seems to turn into Mary Queen of Scots with the last costume.Overall, a great disappointment."
5,Still good,"The style of the movie seemed dated from my current perspective, but it was the same movie I watched and loved many years ago. Thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,"Lovecraft, the most prolific writer I never knew about.","I read a short story by Lovecraft that made me want to read more of his work. Once I ordered this volume of Amateur Journalism (my own writing field), one of my adult children saw it and said he was one of their favorite horror authors. I was shocked. The kids and I have very different tastes in fiction (what little fiction I read), but to know this author has such range gives me even greater respect for him as a writer."
3,England just got merrier,"John Szponarski's The Ultimate Gay Guide promises to sort outthe British gay scene. This guide to gay Britain steps up to fill thevoid left by the disappearance of the UK Spartacus edition. Inaddition to the saucy details we expect from gay guides, there are exhaustive listings of help and support organizations, lawyers and transgender resources. Pack a magnifying glass if you expect to use the maps. END"
5,Family of 6 and we all Love this show!!,"I must echo what many reviews state... This is a beautifully animated show!! There are plenty of laughs for Mom and Dad as well as our 4 children. We own all of Book 1 and are waiting impatiently for the rest to be released. Unpredictable characters, their roles always seem to be changing... One of the few shows I allow my children to watch, and one of the few that we all enjoy equally!! I encourage you to watch with or without the kids since I feel this is for everyone!!"
4,Almost Perfect,"I am writing to show that Avatar: The Last Airbender is also appealing to those in my age group. I started watching the show at age 19. I'm 21 now and Japanese Animation is a personal obbsession.As this is a more kid friendly series I only gave it a four. But don't let that stop you. The series is amazing. Watching all of these wonderful characters face fears, obstacles, and war together is truly moving.And it matures as it advances, just making it all the better for people to watch. This isn't just for kids, it's good for everyone. If you're an anime fan, you should watch this series just because it's got all of the art value, story line advancement, and just enough cuddly interaction to keep you bolted to your seat.It's got you before you know it. Try it out, you'll like it."
3,A classic travellers tale that deserves a better presentation,"This is no doubt a fair translation, but I wish now that I had bought a more modern edition with maps, illustrations and historical context."
4,good stuff,"cleaner versions of prior songs and some new stuff. a must for candiria fans, if a bit pricey"
5,BEST ALBUM YET!!!,"Candiria deliver the goods beyond my wildest expectations. This band is soooo far above and beyond all other bands in the genre. They are like Soundgarden was to grunge and Janes Addiction was to alternative-groundbreaking!This is the first album that comes close to capturing the energy of their live shows. ""Bring the Pain"" is very impressive and the bonus CD has a bunch of cool stuff from their C.O.M.A. camp that I guess they will be releasing in the near future."
3,Not too Ready for vista,"Like the previous reviewer said, drivers dont work. Had to download drivers from ATI website. I dont know why they claim it's vista ready because, although its enabled, the premium Aero version is extremelly slow. I have to turn it off just to be able to work. Bought it for running vista premium cant even run it."
3,"Yes, the X1300 PCI will play Battlefield 2","I bought the Diamond ATI x1300 PCI card for my son's Dell, which used integrated graphics and has only PCI slots. For anyone in a similar postion who wants to play Battlefield 2, the answer is, yes, it will play Battlefield 2 with most of the graphics settings set to ""low."" I'm sure we're missing plenty of eye-candy but it was a lot cheaper and easier than upgrading the mother board or replacing the entire machine.Installation was easy but slow.I previously tried a Radeon 9250 in the same machine and it would not play Battlefield 2. I think the key is that the x1300 supports DirectX 9.x."
5,"read this, it will change your approach to getting things done",has activities that help you along in the book. realistic. I am a graduate student that works 75+ hours a week in a lab and this has definitely helped me organize my time and approach to what I need to accomplish. Read it.
5,Duff's best,Hey people! This album is amazing... McKagan sounds better than ever! I was looking for this CD since I heard it but all that I knew was that it hasn't been released. Finally I found it! I can't wait to put my hands on it... Get your one!
5,Searching for Ancestors? New Keys to hlep.,"Hidden Sources covers many sources that new and experienced Genealogists use. Where ever one is in their search, this book conatins sources help find ancestors and information about their lives. Through these ancestors living relations will be found, some may have family bibles, diaries, pictures to share. Hidden sources helped me get over a 20 year old brick wall. This book should be on every family researchers' book shelf. I recommend re-reading it every year or so. The significance of a section may not be apparant until the researcher hits a snag.ETRDenver"
3,pretty basic primer,"this is a pretty basic primer for those just beginning to collect oriental carpets. There are quite a few pictures/examples, although the book is less than comprehensive."
3,"A witty, light-hearted read","I bought this book on an impulse - it looked like a fun, amusing and light-hearted read. And I wasn't wrong, as I was smiling with nearly every page.Emma is very likeable for a witch, and one can easily empathize with her as she struggles to strike a balance in her life - using her power scrupulously to make a living, doing something about her non-existent love life and helping those near and dear. I love her relationship and interaction with her best friend, Victor. Her love interest, William, however, isn't as well-developed a character as Emma, hence he isn't very interesting and I can't feel for him.There are too many side-plots which distract the story - the man in the park, the embezzlement and the villain, and Emma's countless rescue of the hapless Hoff and Susan, which by far irritates me the most. There should have been more focus on Emma and William.All in all, a light, entertaining read."
3,Hexy,"Valerie Frankel's heroine Emma Hutch is surprisingly believable and utterly captivating - a good witch with orange eyes and a rare gift- but becomes increasingly unbelievable because she is SO utterly gorgeous and a super-sexual dynamo. The story itself got campier and more over the top silly with the half-baked corporate embezzlement storyline,lashings of real life celebrities thrown in the mix (in unflattering ways). Not to mention happy endings for everyone. New York came across well in all its goofy denizened,luminous glory and the supporting characters are fun. I just got bored with Emma's romance with boring William Dearborne. And this was a short book!"
4,SHOCKING DETAIL,"After reading Mr. Kenny's account of the Mollys, I have a much better understanding of what really transpired in the coal fields of Eastern Pennsylvania over 100 years ago. Going beyond the typical view of the Mollys as a band of drunken criminals of Irish origin, Kenny tells of the political and corporate corruption that existed in the 1850s to 1880s. While not displaying total sympathy for the Mollys - since many did fit the stereotypical image, Kenny's accounts will change one's perspective of this group. Well worth reading."
5,"The who, what and why of the Mollies finally explained.","The who, what and why of the Mollies has been muddied by time and myth. Kenny clarifys the mud and myth in this straightforward, honest assessment of the Molly Maguires and those who were obsessed with their demise. A truly excellent work and a must for anyone interested in Molly lore."
3,Secret Societies Knee-Deep in Coal Dust,"One of the better interpretations of this turbulant era in the coal belt. Kevin Kenny explores the complicated society relationships and both factual and circumstantial evidence that led to the the conviction of some of the ringleaders. Unlike the 1970 movie ""The Molly MacGuires,"" this book assures the reader that series of violent events over a number of years was no simple story to tell. The subsequent convictions of some of the coal miner leaders was hotly contested in its day. Add this book to your collection if you are a student of 1800's Pennsylvania or the treatment of Irish immigrant miners during the period of the Molly MacGuires."
2,good,"the book was a real good read.but the multi-colored highlights made it difficult to focus on the subjest at hand-it was described as ""good"" should have said ""very used"""
5,The Fuzzy Yellow Duckie Catnip Kong,My cat loves this toy. He loves to shake it around in his mouth. He loves to roll on his back and bat at it. He carries it around with him like it is a prize possession.
5,"My cat's favorite toy, and it lasts a while","This is my cat's favorite toy among many. It is well-constructed and much more durable than other similar toys which he will usually destroy in a day or two if he actually plays with them. He'll just rip cheap toys apart. Most toys which survive are because he doesn't actually play with them.In contrast this toy lasted about a year of frequent daily playing before he had finally managed to tear it apart beyond recognition, so I ordered a replacement and it's still going strong.My cat also likes to play fetch with this toy: he'll drop it near me and meow loudly. I throw it, and he'll bring it back a minute later for another round. Not quite like fetch with a dog, but hey, he's a cat. It's still cool.Great cat toy."
3,Cat didn't get much use out of it,"My cat enjoyed the catnip, and he picked up the toy in his mouth and toted it around the house a bit, but after a few days he abandoned it. It's not big enough for him to cuddle and wrestle with either."
1,Coffee Grinder/Power Generator,"If you were looking for a quiet humidifier, this is a falsely advertised and disappointing product. Even after letting it run for 30-60 minutes, this humidifier was too loud, even closing the doors couldn't mask the loud, grinding, and machine-like sounds of this ""humidifier"". buyer beware!"
5,Sleep-tastic,I live in a dry climate so this humidifier has been the answer to my dreams!!! It is quiet and efficient. I wake up with less dry nose and mouth situations now. t has also helped my cats...I know that sounds weird but they used to wheeze and now they seem better!!!
5,Great Indian Wars Book,"This book is detailed and well researched. It covers Sheridan's entire career and and is not boring or over detailed. If you like to read about Indian Wars on the Great Plains, this book will please your quest for good reading."
4,Great deal for the price,"The phone has all the required features for a cordless phone, reception is clear, caller ID is programmable to customize the name of the incoming call for family and friends.Only complaint is that the AC plug slips out of the main base a little too easy and can cause you to lose connection, but if the base is in a stationary place, no problem at all."
1,Buyer beware! $25 for a lousy term paper.,"I agree entirely with the reviewer who called this publication an: ""Overpriced pamphlet - an outrageous ripoff.""I purchased the pamphlet based on the first few reviews and did not see the last review before making my purchase. I am convinced now that the first few people to review the pamphlet were hired by the publisher (or maybe it was the publisher using different names!). How anyone in their right mind or in good conscience could recommend paying $25 for this flimsy, poorly printed, content-devoid, term paper is beyond me.Buyer beware! I've never tried to return something to Amazon before - don't even know what their return policy is. But, I am certainly not going to keep this item whether or not they refund my money."

3,Golden Horseshoe is a Good Synopsis,"Having read several other biographies of other U-boat aces, I was somewhat disappointed in the relative lack of anecdotes and the necessarily detached viewpoint of the book. (being written in the third-person) Overall, however, the book is well written and provides a very good whole-view of Kretchmer and his career, both pre-war and through the course of his somewhat brief war and much longer time in captivity. A good starting point to learn about the man, and some interesting insight into the Battle of the Atlantic, very much from a British perspective, but with quite apparent admiration for a worthy and gentlemanly adversary."
3,Beginners Beware,"This book does present scholarship that uses and (sometimes) defines a variety of themes and approaches to art criticism, but most of the writings are highly esoteric, randomly selected, and not always focused on the visual arts. If you don't already have a solid understanding of concepts like ""Post Modernism"" and ""Commodity"" don't expect any clear answers here. This is less of an explanatory textbook-type work, and more of a compilation of modern critical writing. Pre-requisite: PhD."
3,"GOOD PHOTOGRAPHY, VERY SHORT BOOK","There are currently many books available on the World Trade Centers, both before and after the tragedy of September 11th. This one, with photographs by Rajs, has more than forty breath-taking shots, along with some very technical information in regard to the planes which crashed into the trade centers. It is a mixture of both past and present. The photography was the book's strong point.On the downside, I found the book to be extremely short, and the technical aspect as far as construction of the trade centers and physical dimensions of aircraft, personally, did not interest me to any great extent. There is a tribute in print published by Life Magazine that, in my opinion, far surpasses this one. While ""Sometime Lofty Towers"" contains beautiful photography and interesting facts, if I personally was purchasing a book as a memorial or keepsake, I would opt for the one by Life Magazine. It truly is magnificent, as are most publications by Life."
3,Nice photos but.........,"Yes, the photographs are beautifully composed and quite striking, the text good if occaisionally flowery. The interspersion of 9/11 photos are what I could do without. My memories of the WTC are of gleaming towers of strength and pride, not smoking husks. Some readers will find their memories reflected in these pages, some will not. Consider how you wish to remember the WTC before you select a photo tribute book."
2,Disappointed!,"I thought this workout would be very high intensity and I thought I would be challanged. I was also expecting a great varity of moves. I work out everyday, and I hardly broke a sweat. If you are an advanced exerciser, you will be disappointed. The only time I was challanged was during the ""Power"" section, which is for a minute after every section (there are three (3) sections). This is a good DVD if you're looking for a low impact workout, that is not too intense. If you want a ""kick-butt"" workout, this is not it.The instructor, Lizbeth Garcia, is nice enough, and I recognized several of the background people from other Crunch DVD's. This DVD does not measure up to the standard of Crunch."
2,Difficult to Follow,"I was very diappointed with this tape. There's no way the average person with no previous latin dance or kickboxing experience can follow these moves. There isn't even any instuction prior to beginning the workout, and everyone on screen is facing the camera, which makes it even more difficult to follow."
3,Alright :-l,"I've come to realise that Crunch dvds vary from excellent to average. They aren't consistant at all. This workout is average at best. It's fun in parts but it's not challenging and it's not intense enough if you want a true fat burning workout. I am totally surprised that the instructor (Lizbeth Garcia) doesn't move a lot. She and the other exercisers don't use a lot of space and maximise the workout potential. When they do knee lifts in the boxing segment, they barely lift their leg. It's certainly not the best Crunch workout out there, although for beginners, this might be perfect. It's alright for the days where you feel like taking it very easy. (I also would have thought that a crunch workout dvd done in 2006 would use a new set instead of the same tired set they've used since forever)."
3,"Good workout, annoying instructor","The workout on this DVD looks very challenging, but the instructor is very obnoxious. I didn't even finish the workout because the instructor is so annoying."
4,Good for light days,I use this DVD for light days (I am high intermediate/low advanced level). The cardio routines are fun and the one minute blasts do get my heart rate up nicely. Lizbeth is not grating or irritating to me and suprisingly most of the background exercisers are tolerable (Crunch background exercisers can be very annoying).
4,good cardio dvd...,"I just bought this dvd recently, it is a really good dvd. It gives you a lot of variety. i especially like the kick boxing part. i ve been doing cardio kickboxing for a while. it's my fave type of workout. i realy wish they had a crunch gym by me ,but the colest one is all the way in NYC. it's good they put the acutal classes on dvd for people who can't go to the gym. I also reccomend Crunch : cardio dance blast and Crunch : Cardio salsa. if u like dance and want a good workout too ,these are the best."
1,Barely broke a sweat,"I did this work out once, that was plenty. I was not at all impressed by it. The only thing I actually enjoyed were the power bursts. The rest is fine if you're just starting out. I've been working out for ten years. I like a work out that challenges me and this one didn't even come close."
3,okay,"Not the best work out, a moderate pace, easy to follow. You can do better if you want cardio: switch to Jillian Michael's"
4,NICE PRODUCT & WELL PRESENTED,"THIS IS A LOVELY CASE. IT WORKS WELL AND IS EQUALLY AS WELL MADE AS ANY PURSE, OR WALLET."
3,Card organization system,"Our family has multiple cameras and devices that utilize memory cards. The item was purchased for storage and organization to make certain the cards are ready to go when we are. The case has the features necessary, but isn't as sturdy as I expected. It will get the job done and provide organization within the larger camera bags we own."
2,Lasted only 18 months,I was a satisfied customer till it stopped working after 18 months. I am taking my chances and ordering a new one.
5,EASY to use,This is a great product. It is very easy to install and program. Works great and once set it saves energy with no attention at all.
3,"Great idea, dubious longevity","I installed this product 2 years ago on my electric hot water heater. It is pretty easy to install if you have knowledge & comfort around 220V electricity. While it worked, it was excellent-- very flexible programming. Surely it saved us quite a bit of money. The question is, did it save enough to pay for itself in 2 years? Because that's how long it lasted. One of the two relay switches has failed, so although the clock and ""power"" light still work, it will no longer turn on the water heater (I tested it throughly before coming to this conclusion.) I'm ordering a new one, because I liked it so much until now. I considered replacing it with the mechanical version, but those seem to have longevity issues, too. Bottom line: If you think this can save you $35 a year or more, it's worth it. Otherwise, probably not."
4,It was great until it failed!!!! But wait,"IT FAILED!!!! I Bought this timer about 4 years ago. It is easy to install and use, I'm looking for a different brand I would like to get more years out of them.Update!!! The backup battery was bad, when I removed it the unit powered up and started working. I replaced the battery, reset unit and the clock and all is well. So I take back what I said about the unit."
4,"Nice unit, but some quality issues","This is a nice unit with a digital display and timer so there's no guessing how close you are to the actual time like some of the mechanical units.Unfortunately this is my 3rd unit since I bought my house in 1995, as the previous 2 stopped working for different reasons. The timer on the first one stopped working, and a connection on the PC board opened up on the second one due to some type of component failure. Looks like something got hot an you could see how the connection 'arched' when it opened up.Naturally all of the electronics are made in China so I guess it's not a surprise and what you should expect these days. Just frustrating that for the price, you can't get a good quality product anymore.I like the set up of the unit but maybe you'll have better luck with one lasting longer."
2,Expected it to last longer and customer support is not good,"I bought this unit to work with our time-of-day electric rates. It's nice and worked well for three years until it recently stopped working. I'll replace it with the same model. If it again goes out within three years, I'll find a different timer from a different manufacturer.Update October 2012 - I kept my old timer that stopped working and learned it is a blown resistor. I called Intermatic, Inc. and inquired about the type of resistor so I could fix it and keep it as a spare. I was told by their technical support folks they couldn't tell me the specs. because the specs. are ""proprietary."" Unbelievable! They don't want me to fix it so I'll have to buy a new one. Because of their customer support, I'm lowering my rating to two stars."
5,Hot Water Timer,Works just the way I needed it to. It should save money on electricity bills. We have two hot water heats so I did both.
3,doesn't work... electrician says bad unit... and where's Seller ?,product came as promised on time.... it took me a while to obtain an electrician and now that he's come over to put the timer in it doesn't work...Seller is sending a replacement unit.
1,Died after 3 years,Has light that says it's on -- but light is not connected to output. No voltage at outlet and strange smell implies burnt parts inside. Time to throw it away and get a different brand -- this is too expensive and too hard to install to be replacing frequently!
5,I love it. My wife hates it,"Some what techical install, you have to know the difference between line and load to install. I love it, works well, easy to program. Programed ours for 1hour on in the morning and 5 hrs on in the evening. My wife hates having to conform to 6 hrs on time. I was easily able to overcome this by telling her to get over it......besides she's cuter when she's chilly....."
4,water heater timer,"First off the instx are terrible unless you're an electrician. Then they may make sense. WHICH may be so that the average joe does not try wire this joint up and kill his/her family. Wellllllll.....I am not your average joe! I have roommates and no live-in family so too bad for them! (But in all reality this is a job for a licensed professional. We're talking water, metal, and electric all together in the space of inches)I used the very helpful uploaded pictures when wiring the timer. I had some extra 12 gauge wire lying around which was very helpful in that the supplied jump wires weren't quite long enough. Two big tips. 1- please please PLEASE turn off the circuit to the heater. Use a multimeter to ensure you flipped the correct one. 2. Wire and tighten as much as you can, and prep the wires to/from the water tank, before trying to tie everything together. It's much easier to hook the wires first and then tighten them than to try to do it while standing on a ladder!"
3,Water Heater Timer,I would have given it a five overall rating but since it was installed wife and kids have over rode timer daily.
4,"Good product, very poor install instructions !",Great product but install instructions are very sketchy [I'm being kind here]. I had to call customer service at a toll call number to get a step by step install process. Lucky for me my pal who has a home wiring back round as a electrician was there to talk to the customer service person. Other wise I would have had to hire a electrician who would have been stumped also. Seems to be a good product but very unfriendly on the install.
2,sassy2,"Great when it works right but keeps shutting off the circuit breaker, and then when I want to do dishes or take a shower we have to turn it back on and wait for water to heat. It will work for 3-4 days and then blow out the again. We finally just shut it off. I bought it to save money, but I feel that we wasted the money we paid to purchase this product."
2,Electronics Easily Fried,I installed this and it worked very well for a couple months. It may be the only one that lets you schedule weekends. I had to move it for other reasons and sometime during the move the electronics fried themselves. I had power turned off for 5 minutes before beginning the move. Static? I will never know. Switched (pun intended) to the GE mechanical one that I have to turn on myself on the weekends.
3,water heater timer,Bought this model of timer about 3 years ago. It has failed. It is easy to install and use but the main power relay coil has failed and I can't repair it so I must order another one.
3,The timer is not durable,"I use this timer to control my water heater. It is not real easy to program but after hours of practice I have it figured out. ONce it is programmed it works fine. However, it is not durable. I have had to replace it three times in two years. I should find another timer but it is easier to keep ordering a new one and popping the new timer into the old housing. If it breaks again, however, I will definitely seek another brand."
4,NOT MUCH LONGEGIVITY,"This one worked fine but crapped out after 18 months (warranty only good for 1 year) At $62 a unit, it's questionable whether I broke even on electricity savings. A disappointment.Updated Review:I feel obligated to update my rating from two stars to four. The company's support was outstanding and I bought a replacement. I must admit the the first unit worked perfectly until it malfunctioned and my new unit is just humming along. I'm a satisfied camper."
5,Best Product of it's kind on the market!,"This is the best hair smoother! I also use it on my skin after shaving and on my nails. Expensive yes, but the BEST"
4,Awesome Live Band,"The Angelic Upstarts never seize to amaze me.I wish i was able to see them live.I rarely buy live cds because of the reason that they get mighty boring at times.But this live cd never lets you down.No one can argue that ""Im An Upstart"" was made to be sung live.But the stand out one this cd is definatly the anthem ""England"".So much soul on that song live its amazing.Bottom Line is that this cd is more than good enough to be in your collection espiacilly if your into the kind of punk these guys play."
5,Love at first sight,I love my new Barefoot practice rug. It is very cheerful and bright. Makes me want to get up and practice some yoga!
3,Not exactly what the product description and other review would have you believe...,"From the product description: ""Recorded the Way April Wine Used to Record: Pure Analog! Two Inch Tape, 24-track Recording, with Half-inch 2-track Master Tape. No Digital Equipment During the Entire Process, and the Result Speaks for Itself.""Ok, that may all be true and it may lead you to believe that this is a throwback to vintage April Wine---trust me it isn't. If you are looking for Harder...Faster era (or earlier), then look elsewhere. The album isn't bad, although it is a bit laid back for my taste, but it is nothing close to their vintage sound nor do the songs match up to the vintage era. I didn't hate it, but I did find it boring and probably wouldn't play it on any sort of regular basis. I've certainly heard this band do much better."
2,A Great Promising Mess,"There are two distinct stories going on here: Richard Rubin's coming of age as a NY Jew who travels South to report on Greenwood, Mississippi; Handy Campbell's descent from an African Amercian high school football star to defendant in a gruesome murder trial. Neither of the story is probably worthy of a book, and mashing them together doesn't work either. Rubin has some great observations on what he calls the New Old South, and writes about high school sports compellingly. But not nearly as well as in Friday Night Lights. The two stories just never jell; Milan Kundera can get away with this sort of trick; Rubin can't. The supposed climax of the book is the murder trial, but it in fact reads like a trial transcript interspersed with Rubin's somewhat obvious observations about race, criminal justice, and black-on-black crime. Nice try, no pigskin."
2,Yet one more New Yorker Writing about the South,"Mr. Rubin writes of his experiences working on a newspaper in the Mississippi Delta, the ""most Southern Place on Earth"" There are actually two unrelated books here, one about what interesting people the natives are and how they deal with the race problem, and the other about a crime in which a local high school footbal star is involved. The first book has it moments, and Rubin as an interested outsider does make perceptive observations. The second book about the crime just never gets going. It just sort of goes on and on. It might have been better treated as an article in the Atlantic.I really wanted to like this book more than I did."
4,Coming of age in Mississippi,"This was a quick and interesting read. Rubin has a very comfortable writing style, entertaining and smooth.The first half of the book specifically is a great ""coming of age"" story with the collision of two worlds -- the traditional conservative Southern lifestyle as seen by a Liberal New Yorker. It is clear that the author learned and grew from his experiences, and had a great deal of his innocence lost, on so many levels during his year in Mississippi. Many of us experienced similar changes in the first few years out of college; for me, the story evoked memories of choices made and opportunities lost. I'm sure that we can all empathize with his hope that the first boss did not regret hiring him every day he came into work.The second half is a well-written, if a bit dense, who-done-it. Some of the conclusions were a bit obvious, but again, it was interesting watching the loss of innocence yet again in Rubin's life.All in all, the book is worth the time."
4,Great at detail; Poor at putting in context,"The American interaction with the Nazi personel at the end of WW II was very uneven. Some Americans did their job. While others treated these most horrible Nazi's with undeserved deference. This book contains individual articles by one or more ofthe co-authors. The information in each article is very important, drawing on the latest declassified (at the time of publication)documents. However, the book is weak at putting the info in context and in drawing conclusions."
2,WRIST BANDS,Mizuno 5-Inch Wristbands--Not enough elastic in bands--TOO LOOSE-Not what I wanted-Needed more support! They were supposed to be tight fitting??
4,I like 'em,"These comfortable sweatbands work great for keeping sweat off your hands and grips while road cycling which has been a major problem for me when I ride in the hills. These are not the fluffy type. While thin they are as thin as spandex and strong as spandex. The elastics don't feel extremely strong, and would not offer the added support that spandex would. The elastics are just strong enough to hold them in place and do not constrict your movement or circulation. I have large hands and wrists and these slide on without stretching very much which may be a good thing for their longevity. On the other hand they may be too big if you have average sized hands and wrists."
3,Mizuno 5- Inch Wristbands,"I bought these knowing that they were not pure sweat absorbing wristbands as stated in another buyer's review. They absorb a little sweat but for the price and quantity (2), for me it was worth it."
2,Too big for kids,These compression bands are too big for my 8 year old catcher. Regular cotton ones fit much better and provide more padding.
3,Wristbands,"They are comfy but after several times wearing them, they start to frey. Was hoping for something longer lasting instead of trying to hide the strings."
2,NOT for tennis,"This wristbands are not the tenis type Wristbands.These are not good for absorbing sweat.Elastic is not tight, not useful for wrist compression.I don't know really what for are these wristbands."
1,Colors Too Dark,"The colors are pretty but they are so dark in hue that I can't read the CD/DVD label inside. I decided to buy clear ones instead. Otherwise, I do like the slim size and I found only a couple broken ones in the box."
3,good but,"the quality of plastic is very easy to break. still 2 cases hold 4 discs and take up the same room as 1 standard CD jewel case. despite its flaws, its still recommended for saving space."
3,"Work well, but colors a little dark to read through","I bought these covers for my P90X dvds because the paper folder they came in was annoying to use. These cases are thin and work well, the thing I don't like about them is that the yellow ones were the only ones that are really easy to see through. The purple, blue, and green are really hard to read through."
3,Slim line cases,Had a few damaged cases that I had to throw away. That's the only thing that i was really disliked about the purchase.
1,discs stick together,the cases r so slim that the discs r touching. after awhile my ps3 games r sticking together & its a game just pulling them apartdvd probably would stick alsostill great cases but now i know just 1 disc per case
5,Excellent Double Cases,Quality for sure. Well priced. Note...due to the design...no roomto add a cover sheet. Write on the case or insert the disc with the recorded surface facing you.
2,Maxell CD-392 Double Slim Line CD Jewel Cases,"This is an okay product. However, the CDs have a tendency to fall out of the case every time you open them. Would not purchase again. It's too bad -- I like the colors just not the quality."
3,"THESE HAVE CHANGED, NO LONGER THE SAME","I already had about 200 of these. I ran out finally and I ordered some more the other day only to open the package and find a pack of jewel cases that look nothing like the 200 I already have. The old ones are sleek, have deep beautiful color, and are just plain nice to look at. These new ones are different, different color, different design, and now are half clear and half colored. I liked the old ones allot more. These are just not as good, not as classy, even dare I say ugly. What a bummer."
3,they're fine,"I bought these,I didn't realize you could't fit a ""artwork"" paper inside the cover - these cases are for CDs or DVDs only. They work. They also have a handle part, for hanging on a display, not something I find useful."
4,a colorful way to show ur cd/dvds,"I used these a long time ago, when I found some on sale. These are a colorful way to show off and condense your CD or DVD collection...a real space saver. Although u need to put your discs backwards to see the titles...its still a cool way to store discs. I bought 4 packs of 25 and they gave me back half of my shelf space back. :)"
5,Jewel cases,These jewel cases are really sturdy and very good for using after transferring my Lp's to CDs. I can get at least 4 albums on 2 CD's and with the same singer.. keep them together. Much less expensive than stores usually carry and better quality.
3,Nice but flimsy,Bought 2 boxes of these cases. Very colorful and met my needs of 2 cd's per case. They work ok. But when shipped one of the boxes took some banging around in the poorly packed shipping box that 15 out of the 25 were received broken. The corner of the case cracked so they can't be used. Any chance of a refund or credit amazon? So an ok case but be concerned about the shipping. Great price.
4,Gazing Glode Glow,I ordered this thinking it would glow bright for at least a few hours (4-5 hrs). It glows but it is suttle and lasts only 2 1/2 hours on solar power charge. Glass is very fragile and not very reflective during the daylight. But I do like the uniqueness of the solar glow.
4,Glow Gazing Ball,"This gazing ball is very nice, the only additional features that I would have liked are: more glow in the dark swirls and less of a knob on the bottom for stands that are open (you can see the knob)."
1,Dissapointment,"The Echo Valley glow in the Dark does not seem to have any glowing effect. It has had plenty of sun during the day,but still does not glow at night.Purchased this item from Amazon."
2,Description is not accurate,"I bought this for my backyard garden waiting anxiously for the evening to see it ""illuminated"". Sadly it does not, it is pretty and all that but does not illuminate at all. I was sorely disappointed!!!"
2,false glow in the dark,The gazing globe is beautiful in the daylight but totally invisible at night. The glow in the dark statement is a false claim that should be removed as false advertising.
1,wasted money,"I purchased this item with the stand. I was happy, waiting for sunny days to see the full effect, but before I could enjoy the ball, it got windy and the whole thing fell over--glass all over the yard!!! If you do purchase this item, I advise you to embed it in your garden for safety."
3,Glow in the dark ball,Nice glass design and swirl. Not too strong on the glow part! Was expecting a little brighter glow. Colors are nice.
1,Does not work,this item is pretty during the day but does not even glow a little it is completely dark at night. I was very dissapointed.
3,Globe,This is pretty during the day and does SEMI glow but I was anticipating brighter results at night
2,Marketed incorrectly,"Hello all globe lovers. This particular globe caught my attention simply because of my 3 small boys. They love objects that light up when it's dark. This globe is in direct sunlight in my backyard for at least 8 hours. With some past Amazon recommendations I did move the globe closer to our house. It was hysterical because my very smart 11 year old said, ""this is to illuminate?"" and my response was, yes. We squinted very hard but no glow. And if people have time for flashlights to attempt to make it glow, I'd love to change day jobs with you. I'm not complaining, it's gorgeous. I'm a marketing manager and I professionally consider this false advertising/marketing. Thank you, ;-)"
2,No Glow,We got it as a gift. Set it up in the back yard hoping to see it glow in a nights worth of California sun and no results. It has been two months since the arrival and it still has not glowed for us. But it is a pretty color during the day .
2,Junk,This item does not glow as claimed. I have used it for several days and nights with no result. I would not purchase this item again.
3,Does not glow :(,I got this as a father's day gift and it doesn't glow... A little disappointed about that cause I would have bought a globe from my local store that doesn't glow but looks beautiful if I knew this one wouldn't glow.
2,No Glow,"The gazing ball is more like a cheap plastic ball. I think it is made of glass, but it doesn't look like it. It does not glow-in-the-dark, in fact it doesn't glow at all, and I made sure it gets eight hours of sun light everyday. However, nothing with make the paint on this globe glow. Really cheap feeling too. I have waited to purchased a gazing ball for my garden until I found one I thought would be unique. Guess I am still waiting."
4,Pleased With Purchase,"My previous globe was shattered in a hail storm. This globe is lighter in color than it appears in the Amazon picture and so far I have not seen it glow in the dark! If it is solar, then I have plenty of sun living in Arizona but I did not buy it to glow although that would be a plus. I bought my first globe at Hobby Lobby for half the price. But, it is just a glass gazing ball for the back garden and for what it is, I am pleased with the purchase."
4,Echo Valley,"This product is every bit as beautiful as described. While other reviewers have found fault with the facts that it does not ""glow"" very brightly in the dark it is just luminous enough to identify that a garden enhancement is there. It really is quite lovely during daylight hours.I would have given this a five star rating where it not for the fact the moisture barrier, which must remain in place at the bottom of the globe (made of a rubber-type substance), was noticeably damaged. Amazon was more than willing to make an exchange, but I decided to repair it myself, as return shipping for such a petty item is such a hassle."
2,Not DP style.,Was not very impressed with the music. I think do not think the rythm and the electronics were able to justify the grandeur of DP. I would recommned the re-mixed version over the songs on this cd.
1,Tribute.....?!,"Wow,..i got this cd,..and it wasnt very good,The tribute was more like they where trying to disrespect Depeche Mode.DM is one of my fav groups out there..but i wanted to hit my head with this ablem over and over again.."
5,Backyardigans and My Grandson,My grandson is 16 months old and just loves to watch the Backyardigans. This is a great video which emphasizes using your imagination to have fun. Nice bright colors and cute characters. I think your kids and grandkids would love it too!
5,Yeah Sonny!,"Like Sonny Rollins?Buy this recording.It will be one of the best jazz recordings you'll ever ever here,,,,God Bless the tenor saxophone,,,God Bless Coltrane,,,Bless Dexter,,,God Bless Gato,,,God Bless Rashhan,,,God Bless Sonny,,,Go ""Play It In The Yard""Dave DoyleLos Angeles,Ca"
3,"Great Series, Lousy Translation","First of all Gravitation is one of my all time favorite series, and I own all the manga in the original Japanese. I was thrilled when Tokyopop picked up the series, but after a 2 month release delay, the finished product was very disappointing. The dialogue between the characters seems so out of character and frivolous. Gravi is a funny, sweet, and occasionally caustic manga about the truly emotionally dysfunctional. Here it just seems silly and dumb. Gravi is often silly (Mr. K!), but rarely dumb. Tokyopop has done a much better job on some of their other translations, I hope they can improve upon this, and give the fans the REAL Gravitation."
1,Not to great,"I don't really think that a shounen-ai manga is... well, right. I mean when I first heard about it I had NO clue what it was about, but now that I know first hand, I'm sorry but I'm disgusted do NOT read if you get as disgusted with shounen OR shoujou ai as i do."
3,Can't believe i am saying this but....,"I was kinda disappointed with this,i am a huge,huge fan of gravitation,and i was so excited when i learned that it will be translated into english through tokyo pop. so i bought it,read it and.....to me it seems like an alternate universe,the characters personalitys are diffenernt it seems to me,alot of the humor was lost.and in alot of places i am very conviced they totally changed parts in coversations,and it left me saying ""where the hell did that come from?!"" and ""the hell?"" *sigh* i am very,vey disappointed,but it is not a total bad job,i just wonder why they had to change so much it was perfect the way it was. but it is still pretty good,especially if you never read the original manga,i would still recomend it,disappointment or not you can't keep a fan down or away lol."
2,A bit mundane,"This was certainly not one of the better Authority stories. The art was about as good as any other average Authority graphic novel, but the story was really unimaginative.The bad guys were not moving and contained no really original powers. The story of Jenny Spark's twin sister was really lame. All of the predicaments the team found themselves in were solved way to easily and with nothing short of brute force.Overall, I was really disappointed with this story line. On a more positive note, it seems to me that The Authority: Revolution was much more inspired."
2,Rehash and uninspired art,"This most recent Authority tpb is a bit of a disappointment. The first story about the Authority fighting a new religion is a poor use of the concept of the team, kind of a ""they've faced government, now they'll face religion"" cliche. The second story about Jenny Quantum's twin rehashes Transfer of Power's ""what if there was a moral opposite of the Authority"" plotline. Also, dwayne and portaccio just aren't great pencillers. Buy the other collections, but this one you can pass up."
5,Great read,This book fleshes out the lore for MTG and a definite must read if you you enjoy learning about MTG lore.
3,Worst Of the 3,"Of the 3 books in this cycle i thought this was the weakest. But, It is still a enjoyable read and you need it to tie the first and last books togther which i recomend fairly highly."
2,"amazing,astonishing!!!!!","Yes, as the title segests the book is amazing and astonishing.But none in a good way.It's amazing how the book's not conected to the cycle. I mean, it is usefull to read it to understand the next book but it has allmost nothing to do with the third one-the Guildpackt. and its astonishing how this book doesn't have any slightest conection with the card excpention. It still is a good story so I give it two stars.But even the story is not that interesting. If you're searching for a good book,give a to try Time Spiral."
5,The Definition of Swing,"This is by far the best album available of Basie's ""New Testiment"" band. I definitely prefer this set over the more popular ""Complete Atomic Basie"" album. The arrangements are true to the Basie idiom, and stick to swinging the blues. The soloists sound inspired throughout, not to mention the virtuosic section work (dig that sax section!). Sonny Payne also is at his best here, playing very tastefully and accurately. Also, they did a marvelous job with the remastering of this album. The sound is crystal clear. I don't think I have ever heard the Basie rhythm section sound more clear than on this album. You can hear every little nuance of what Basie, Green, Jones, and Payne do during the songs. This album is what jazz is all about, and I highly recommend picking this one up today!"
5,Excellent swing,I truly don't know the best of swing-style jazz; this is just the best among what I own. Recommended!
5,The Best I Spy book - It's FUN!!,"Ryan 9 yrs - I thought the book was fun and challenging, the pictures are good. The best section is the model cars in a town."
5,I Spy is a terrific series.,My husband and I have more fun with these books whether it's with our grandson or our friends. We really get into it and found that it helps our eye coordination and our memory. I would highly recommend this to anyone at any age!
5,Truly a great learning book!,"I find these books great mind stretchers, even for us older folks. This book especially is a learning tool because there is a page with all the letters of the alphabet surrounded by little objects that start with each letter. Another page groups things by category with overlapping categories. Really well done."
5,Great Stuff,This thing is great. Many styles...like the stuff Joe wrote the best. You've got to hear it...
5,Thank you for rapid delivery.,"Having to recoup from an illness. Must spend time in bed. Watching 'Walker"" beings me joy. This order was delivered in expedient timing. I appreciate that. Haven't watched all of the programs, so don't know about snags in the disks, however they are gleaming clean."
5,"Walker, Texas Ranger","The only complaint I had was that when I opened the DVDs, all the prongs that hold the DVDs in the case were broken.But, of course, watching the DVDs were GREAT!!!"
5,"""The Eyes Of The Ranger Were Upon Us""",With new theme song in place Walker roared back for what was really his Third season. This is still one of the better shows about Rangers ever made. The values that are packed into every show make this a must see in my house. keep them coming!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Bad Kindle Version,"This book is is good, the content it self is very acurate and usable. The major issue is the kindle version has a great deal of text errors. In some cases many errors on each page. Whole paragraphs are out of place in some chapters. I would not purchase the Kindle Version of this book. If you want to purchase go with the old fashion paperback."
3,"Eh,","The book is good for an overall explanation of what Krav is about from a martial arts practitioners perspective. But I did not find it very useful. It is supposed to be a ""workout"" rather than martial arts instructions. Unfortunately neither subject lend well to book form. Was good to know some stuff getting into a class. As good as can be expected I guess."
2,Eh...,"This book starts off promising, but turns out to be a rather useless exercise in common sense. All it really teaches you is very, very basic combat moves that anyone instinctively knows anyway. The eyes and groin are vulnerable? No way!I'm suspicious of the 12 week fitness plan as well"
1,Americanized Techniques,I train in real Krav Maga in country. This book is disgraceful to the heritage and founder of Krav Maga. Techniques portrayed are weak and sloppy and not real Krav Maga. This author needs to learn true Krav Maga in country and then write another book apologizing for his poor rendition of a true soldier's art.Patuey!
2,Only by this book if you know nothing about martial arts,"This book teaches punches, and kicking. There is nothing special about this book. Krav Maga is a good self-defense style. You get no self-defense in this book."
2,Less Krav Maga,Started the book and put it down as I was not very interest in hearing the author's personal journey as I was interested in learning this style of self defense. The illustartions were too small and the exercise routine was left until chapter nine!!I however feel that there will be some positives from reading the book!
4,satisfactory,"The book was extremely helpful and informative. written very well, although about a third of the book is nothing but the history and purpose of krav maga. Once it gets into the fighting techniques I found it very useful, but I soon realized that getting a full comprehension of the fighting art would require a teacher. nonetheless, I have learned some valuable techniques and I feel more confident since studying it."
2,Some decent content.... but watered down,"I'm sure David Kahn is a great Krav Maga instructor. This is not a great Krav Maga book however.Much of this book is about why people do Krav Maga, or how they benefitted from Krav Maga. In that respect this really isn't ""an Essential Guide"" at all. It becomes more of a collection of testimonials, stories, and some Krav Maga techniques.If he wrote this book to market Krav Maga, and market his own school? Brilliant.An ""Essential Guide""? Not so much."
3,Hard to tell colors,Had difficulty being able to see a difference in color when adjusting the carburetor jet from lean to rich.
3,original biggles is excellent,i personally do not read this book but i agreed with the review made by the reader from ayer tawar. books written by captain w.e.john is among the best that i have read so far. and i am very disappointed when this site do not have any information about the original biggles. (i would like to keep in touch with the reader from ayer tawar - pls drop me a mail)
4,A fall from #1,"The show started to slide a little as is typical of shows that feature child characters aging. But it was still strong. The addition of Pam, Charmaine and Lance were all plusses and allowed for some good story lines. The continued precociousness of Olivia was a plus. Unfortunately we didn't see enough of the Sondra and Elvin characters although their loss meant not having to see the twins, Winnie and Nelson, who I thought were not good additions. A huge plus was the extremely limited screen time of Vanessa, who had taken on too many similarities to Denise. One flake in a show is enough.My DVD also had episodes 14 and 19 mislabeled."
5,We Love Cosby!,"This is such an amazing television show! I grew up watching this with my parents as a young teen and now my kids are enjoying this show with us. I have not seen it since I was a teen and have enjoyed laughing out loud all over again. My boys love the characters, and of course, LOVE Bill Cosby. We need more shows like this on TV! I have been looking for this Season in many places, but could only find it on Amazon for the best price. I really love owning this for our family. Great show and great price!"
4,Celtic music from a German?,"I got interested in Thomas Loefke when I read he was an admirer of Maire Brennan, and twins Noel and Padraig Duggan (from Clannad) joined his ""Norland Wind"". I loved the older Clannad material. Now I must admit that Thomas has outdone Maire Brennan as a harpist. Lots of soulful Celtic-style plunking, and interesting interpretations of Gaelic/Irish verse. ""Snowy Birch Trees"" was a blissful start, and I worried that the other Tunes wouldn't hold up to it's quality. They did. This is an excellent album -- maybe even better than the first Norland Wind. ""Pos An Píobaire"" is somewhat of a remake, but the new tune and meter make it more pleasing than Clannad's old version (Teidhir Abhaile Riú)."
4,WHERE DOES OUR LOVE BEGIN,BY KIMARA LOVELACE - MOST UNDERPROMOTED SONG.LOVE IT - IT'S FUN AND DANCEABLE AND TOOK ME TWO WEEKS TO TRACK THIS SONG TITLE DOWN.
3,"mix the ""same""","yes, we all love the Body & Soul trio (Frank, Joe, and Danny), but this particular mix did nothing special that would have me howling, cheering, crying, etc... you know, the whole communion house ministry thing! and yes, 2 cd's for the price of one is sweet, but if you already got the other joints by Ron Trent, Tony Humphries, or Kerri Chandler, then I would recommend you save your dough and look elsewhere..."
4,good for hobbyist,"I had three trees that I wanted to turn into lumber, and this was the right price and work pace for me. The setup is easy to figure out but can be a little time consuming."
5,Forever Victoria,"I love Dorothy Garlock, she writes wonderful stories. I was able to find this book on Amazon at a used price and good condition. If you like Dorothy Garlock, I would recommend reading this book."
4,Great songs - Great Young Judy,"Most of the songs are from her Decca recordings. The only problem is that 5 or 6 don't sound really well and that Easter Parade is as it was shown in the film ""That's Entertainment II"" where they cut the chorus end. However, most of it sounds well and if you really like her you should have it, principally because it's worth at price."
3,"Long, but a good read",This was a nice story of learning to trust and not allowing insecurity ruin a chance of having a wonderful relationship. Hillary Houston has the chance of a lifetime and the icing on the cake is meeting a man to share her joy with. Can Brandon put aside his jealousy or risk losing the woman of his dreams? A good read.
2,Poor sound quality overshadows a nice performance.,"An otherwise great performance can't be appreciated because of poor sound quality. The overall tone is harsh throughout making soft passages thin and louder passages clipped. Bass extension is essentially absent, robbing the performance of an important sense of depth. Lastly, in a time when DTS and Dolby surround mix can realistically expand the sound stage and envelop the listener, this mix seems to merely reproduce the front channels and add nothing to the experience. Certainly there are other top-level performances that are technically enjoyable as well?"
2,Superficial,"Giving this book 2 stars is generous, but it did have some useful websites at the end. I found this book to be so superficial that it was as if the author thought that anyone who read it and used these strategies, as well as the interviewers, were very stupid. How can you possibly give someone an answer to a question that is asked, without knowing anything about his specific situation... and if you can give these general answers, shouldn't the interviewer quickly recognize that they are planned and rehearsed? Any company that would hire someone with these answers is not a company I would like to work for."
1,I'd give it fewer stars if I could.,I felt like I'd been mugged by Scott Adams after purchasing this book. It's just more of the recycled pap he's been peddling for years now. Save your money and buy the older books.
1,Tired strips...,"Scott Adams is doing everything he can to alienate his fan base. At least some of the previous ""treasuries"" had a theme, Sunday strips, business topics, etc. This one has no reason at all except to trick people for paying a third time for the same old tired strips.I've bought most of Dilbert's previous original books, but no more. Adams should be ashamed!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Let me start off by saying that I love Dilbert and Scott Adams' work has made me laugh so hard that I have been reduced me to tears on occasion. That said, the only tears Dilbert fans will shed with this collection are tears of frustration. This book is an insult to Dilbert fans. All of this material has been published before. What's more it seems like they couldn't even bother to get an editor to look over this collection before sending it to the printer: some strips get printed twice in this volume. Scott Adams needs to apologize for foisting this collection on his fans."
1,Reruns!!!,"I don't believe it. ANOTHER Dilbert treasury full of strips already published elsewhere. What possible purpose can this book have other than tricking fast buyers and well-meaning relatives into buying it without knowing what it is? I understand this is a business, and if you have a talent you can make a living off of, more power to you, but this is just a blatant rip-off!"
3,"Funny, but no new material.","If you've been a fan of ""Dilbert"" from the beginning, (or have tracked down the old collections) there is nothing here that you haven't seen before (except that some of them may not have been color strips originally); this is a collection of reprints of old Dilbert strips; personally, I don't find an entire book of reruns worth paying for. On the other hand, for people who enjoy Dilbert, but AREN'T familiar with all the old strips, this should be a delightful way to catch up on the history of the strip."
4,Dilbert deja vu encore again part III,"Scott Adams has been producing his hilarious Dilbert cartoons for 15 years now, long enough for many of us to go from cubicle dweller to VP. This is very funny stuff, centered around the themes of co-workers from hell, such as the Office Sociopath and Mr. Goodenrich, the company president, and dysfunctional departments such as Sales. Unfortunately, there is nothing new here, it is all recycled from previously books. For the most part it is also a random collection of strips, with story lines from the go-go days of the 90's now seeming hopelessly out of date.Let me summarize here. Like all Dilbert cartoons, this is funny stuff. Adams was a phone company engineer and knows better than anyone the lunacy of the workplace and he very competently translates it onto the strips. If you have never read Dilbert, do not start here. Go for the earlier books like Willy the Mailboy or Clues for the Clueless."
1,Predictable happy ending to a mundane story,"Grossman's attempt to portray a gay man, Brian Moss is a competently crafted, but unsatisfying story. Familial emotions just don't ring true: Brian's relationships with his father and his twin sister follow the formula of a trained writer, but do not evoke a sense of sympathy, empathy, or truth. The reconciliation scene is not quite credible, for example. The relationship scenes reflect standard assumptions and prejudices about gay men. The technical merits (writing and plot development) deliver an ending fit for a happy movie -- all is well. Hmmm, not with this mediocre novel."
5,Fantastic Recording!,"I have seen this show more times than I can count and now have both the original cast recording and this one featuring the Vegas cast. I like this one much more! The quality of the recording is much greater and the voices are spectacular. If you're only purchasing one of the two versions out there, make it this one."
4,Great product for dyed in the wool DIY types only,"This is a great product and does what it claims. Product support by Granberg is great. However, be prepared for some VERY exhausting work. You will need the biggest, baddest chain saw you can afford. You will need ripping chain. You will need the sharpening equipment for the chain (I built a special jig to hold the saw while sharpening while it is clamped in the mill). You will need timber handling tools (come-alongs, chain, cable) you will need a straight edge (I use a ladder). You will need lots of time (about 100 bd feet of cut lumber per day in the best of conditions). Keep in mind you will need wax to seal the ends of boards, room with proper conditions to stack and dry the wood, skilsaw to trim bark, stickers to stack between the boards. The boards can weigh in at 40 to 100+ pounds. You will likely be cutting the wood in an ""out of the way"" place and have to carry the boards out of there. Lots of beer for afterward YMMV."
1,arm wouldn't stay on!!!!,"My nephew was so excited to open this on Christmas morning, only to find it was broken. We contacted Tonkyn Toys( I think thats how it's spelled) only to find out they won't do anything about it. We were told we would get a return envelope in the mail, which we never did."
1,AAA Barbados,The book was published in 2001 and republished in 2006 manking you think it was a new book. Amazon does not tell you this. I found it out after I bought the book. Basically to old to use.
2,pretty average,I got to Hear His Stuff a Couple Years back&some things were good&others SOunded ok.a very strong Maxwell Influence here&there shapes this set.the good news is that with the right direction of Songs there is a strong Up-swing for Him as a Artist if he Challenges His Creative flow.
4,Awesome,"Yo This album is awesome! Absolutely check it out. Joey's got a great voice and the harmonies with Mark are great. Although there are only a few songs on it, Overise is on the rise and buying this album will help them out so much."
1,Same old...same old!,"If you like emo then you will like this album. If you are like me and absolutely despise emo, hate emo because this is the so-called new ""punk"" when they obviously have no idea where punk rock came from, want to cut your wrists when you hear an emo song on radio/tv (which is why I no longer do either) and cannot see how it has made its way into the mainsteam, you will absolutely hate this album. I just dont understand how anyone can like this music, beside someone who has just broke up with thier girlfriend or is a person who only listens to what MTV puts in thier face. Please for the love of God and all that is holy stear clear of this album and all emo in general. That and rap are the downfall to real music...that is all!"
3,BT Micro,This mouse had a defective charging adapter cable. I returned it but have still not received a replacement.
1,do not buy this p.o.s.,"I normally wouldn't take the time to write a review, but the performance of this product is so exceptionally horrible that I will. I have not been able to use this mouse more than an hour because I CAN NOT GET THE MOUSE TO CHARGE, period. I learned of the problem reading the reviews before I bought the thing and figured, ""It can't be as bad as they say, I'll give it a try"", never have I been more wrong. I will be returning this product 100% unsatisfied."
3,Works Great but...,"The mouse works just fine. Unfortunately, I bought it as a primary mouse not realizing how small it really is. I do have big hands, so someone with smaller hands might find it comfortable to use as a regular mouse. That being said, I have since bought an iBook to use when I go on the road, and will use this mouse for traveling. It should do very well in that capacity."
3,dysfunctional laser - problem solved (see update),"I bought this mouse because of all of the good reviews and ignored the review by ""quicksketch"", thinking that he was probably a whiner. So, I must have gotten his refurbished mouse or this is a repeatable problem with this mouse. I am waiting to hear from tech support and will update this review. I am very frustrated. the mouse worked great for 3 days and now the laser hardly ever comes on!Update: tech support contacted me within a day and suggested that i download the new bluetooth software from the apple website (will not normally update with software updater in apple menu). I did and it has been working great! Unfortunately, I cannot change my rating, but if i could it would be 5 stars!"
2,"Re-charging batteries, an inconsistant problem :-(","While the batteries are charged, a great little mouse. There seems to be a seating problem in the charger. Sometimes it charges & sometimes not."
4,BTMICRO Bluetooth Opt Mouse Review,"Excellent mouse (appearance/feel/utility) and the battery life is just fine. The charging cradle can be tricky--if you don't press the mouse down, it won't charge. Otherwise it works as advertised. I have not experienced any bluetooth disconnect issues and the mouse does not wake my Apple IBook from sleep. Been using it daily for two months without any issues...a very fine product!"
1,There must be better products out there,"I purchased this product because of the bluetooth connectivity. I like the design of the mouse itself and the fact that it comes with a charging cradle. However, since the product malfunctioned within aobut a week, I had to send it back to the company (at my expense) for replacement or repair. I'm still waiting to get it back.The charging cradle didn't work, I think because of poor design and the laser light eventually stopped working."
5,They're baaaaack...,"For those who may have missed this one back in 1984 when it was originally released on <gasp> vinyl </gasp>, here we have some classic Uncle Bonsai tracks, including Charlie and Me, Suzy, Penis Envy, Day Old Whale, and of course the title track, Lonely Grain of Corn. The lyrics, which will give the uninitiated an inkling of what to expect, are available on their web site ..., but you really have to hear them to get the full experience! Words/phrases which describe this group in part: close harmony, topical satire, high voices, virtuoso guitar, clever, stimulating, funny, quick. Go for it!!!"
5,Fun and delight!,"Really, this group was so much fun! The group appears to be still working, but this album was the brightest star in their sky."
3,scary,I can see where this movie would scare a child. One by one someone dies & all you see is a clawed ugly hand or a shadow. Not a bad old movie. worth watching once.
1,Not good at all!,I was stupid and bought this movie. Its hokey. Rent it and see if you want it for your collection. Its so bad I ended up giggling through it as my husband fell asleep! Beware the reviews! I now know to rent them unless I know the movie personally!!!
5,All About the Sculpt and Detail,"I just bought the Mandarin Spawn 2, but since I keep hearing it doesn't stand very well or the weapon breaks easily, I figured I might as well leave him in the box. The window packaging works well for this and you can make out all the fine details without taking him out.I gave him a 5/5 because he is amazing. Just looking at him, he is one of the most amazingly detailed figs McFarlane ever put out. The detail, the armor, the face, the colors, it's all incredible. So, he is getting a 5/5 on this alone since I haven't opened mine. I reccommend collectors to have this one one of the figures you choose to keep packaged. Why risk it?Even better is I just ordered the 12 inch so I expect the detail to be even better."
1,boogie woogie piano,"Waste of money, Most of examples are on organ...most of thestuff is rock and roll not boogie woogie...I've seen and heardboogie woogie and this is far from what I was expecting..."
3,Informative,I received the book in semi good condition. The first few pages detached from the binding. Other than that it was in good shape and I received it in a timely manner. The book does a great job explaining the stages of sexual abuse and drives home the point that the victim is not in any way at fault. The book is from a strong christian perspective so the opening is a gut shot but keep reading and it wil be a great help to recovery and healing.
4,Really Fine Recording,"I love the tuba, which really swings as both a rhythm and a melodic instrument. You can tell Roach was having fun with the tuba. To be honest, I bough the album for Booker Little, who, to me, sounded like a reincarnation of Clifford Brown - warm, full-toned, special."
5,Tuba jazz....,"Drums, bass, tenor sax, trumpet and tuba....great combination with Max Roach leading the way....he was one of the greatest jazz drummers, and this record will prove that to anyone....the tuba blends very well with the bass while the drums fill in every blank space on the page....very melodic album with cool arrangements that really move....great place to start if you have never heard Roach before....incredible...."
5,Quality,"I haven't used this knife yet; however, it's clearly quality. Also, I bought the 12 inch one. Hey, it's Wal-Board. What else can I say!"
2,Sharp knives that fall apart !!!!,"I have to agree with the earlier reviewer who had his knives fall apart on him: I had the same experience. I own some good knives for cooking, and bought the "" good grips "" set because the steel appeared to be quite good, which it is. But after about 1 month of twice weekly usage, one knife literally fell apart while being used. I cantacted Oxo, who promptly sent a replacement. Soon after , the situation repeated itself with another knife in the set. [Evidently, while the knives are full tang in design, they are not one piece, but welded underneath the grips. When sufficient downward pressure is exerted , they tend to seperate. I contacted Oxo again , and sent the set in for a refund. I will probably look for a set of Wusthof or Chicago cutlery instead."
1,Do not buy,"These knives are awful. I have owned them for about six months and they have fallen apart. Not only do the handles seperate from the blade, they rust. Obviously you must be wondering if I put them in the dishwasher, absolutely not!! Yes, they feel good in your hand, but completely worthless for functional purposes after a short while."
2,Great knives but they fall apart,These knives feel very good. I have owned them for about 6 months. The problem is that all of the handles (4 of 6 so far) have broken off inside the handle so most of the knives are now useless. The weld they use is very weak. We used these about 2-3 times per week and then I went to cut a piece of meat with them and the blad came out of the handle. Within 2 weeks 3 more had done the same. I like OXO but don't think I would buy these again.
2,Quotes have little practical or thought provoking use,"I like to e-mail a special ""thought for success"" to our college staff each morning and am always on the look-out for good quotes. This book trumpets more than a 1,000 memorable and thought provoking quotes, but for my purposes, I'll be surprised if I can use more than a handful. A lot of the quotes are truly ancient with little current application. If you like history and old world english you might find some personal enjoyment in the book. However, if you are like me and want to be able to share and use the quotes, you need to look elsewhere."
2,Not that great,"I ordered 6 of these brooms for my shop, and was disappointed in their longevity. After sweeping the debris, you have to sweep again to clean up the broom bristles that fell out. Probably an alright broom if you use it for occasional use for home or garage. Not great for everyday shop use though."
5,The real deal,"This is Fox's new 2008 version of ""The Gang's All Here,"" not the version released last year that also came in the Alice Faye box set. (At least that's where I'm posting. Check the date.) Buy with confidence. Beautiful. Fantastic. You might want to spring for the Carmen Miranda box set, which includes the fascinating and moving documentary ""Carmen Miranda: The Girl From Rio."" Separately, that docu is on the ""Something for the Boys"" DVD."
4,A Great Old Musical,"This is one of the GREAT OLD MUSICALS. Like most musicals there is a thin plot but that is more than made up for by its absolute funness to watch. How can it not be fun with Alice Faye, Carmen Miranda, Edward Everett Horton, Charlotte Greenwood, and the great Benny Goodman and his Orchestra. It is in color and the transfer to DVD is superb! Both Picture and sound are great. This movie has no bad language and no sex and no violence, just great entertainment. A must-see for any fan of great musicals."
5,"Insane, surreal, odd, campy fun.","Yes, it's utterly absurd, and arguably stupid, but this made me laughout loud a number of times, smile a lot of others,, and left my mouthhanging open with 'how did he do that'? camera moves, and 'did he justdo that?!?' visual moments.Berkley adds color to his extravaganza dance numbers wonderfully, andeven the tiny plot is handled with more fun than most of his earlierfilms.Carmen Miranda is terrific, as is Edward Horton, and the musicalnumbers are so over-the-top, and borderline obscene at times and flatout surreal at others that they're worth any moment of creaky dialogue.And for me, there were a lot fewer of those creaky moments than inBerkley's films from the 30s.As others have noted, the 2008 re-release significantly improves oncolor from the 2007 DVD, so make sure you get that version."
5,The 2008 remastered version is a big improvement,"For fans of this movie: yes, the newly remastered edition is much better than the 2007 release. Colors are back to their original super-saturated intensity. If you love this movie, and have the lackluster 2007 version, buy it again, and use the old copy as your ""lend it to a friend"" copy (which you'll most likely never see again, since everyone I've ever shown this movie to loves it immediately). It's worth the extra $15 or so to have it right this time. Get it."
3,Disappointing transfer,"I reluctantly agree with the early comments about the poor quality of the transfer. I own the laserdisk version of this film; it is an extraordinary record of 1940's Technicolor: bright and vibrant. The DVD is a pale comparison.Amazingly, the DVD has a side by side comparison of a 1994 version of the film, and the current, ""restored"" version. This is where the ""before"" is miles better than the ""after."" It looks as though Fox considers getting rid of some specks here and there as representing a full restoration. At Warner, the efforts with Gone With The Wind, Singing in the Rain, Wizard of Oz, etc. have shown that it is possible to get a sharp, clear, colorful result that is arguably better than the original prints. Perhaps this film does not rate as much restorative an effort, but it would have been nice to see, at the very least, as nice a transfer as the earlier laser."
3,Not very satisfied.,"I purchased these in April 2007. I purchased (2) front, (2) rear, and matching steering wheel cover. The color faded out on the steering wheel cover at about 6 months. In March the color started fading on the car mats. I am very disappointed about this. These items were not cheap. Were purchased for my 50th Birthday gift. Just thought you ought to know what happened to these items. My windows are tinted; and I use a sunshade in my front window at all times. Thank you."
1,two thumbs down,"where do i begin..i got this as a birthday present, as my friends know i'm a huge shaw bros. fan. this 10 movie pack is awesome at first glance, but when you watch one of these movies you'll be very dissapointed.i suspect someone was trying to cash in on the recent re-discovery of peope liking shaw bros. the quality is that of a bad vhs. the ones that are subtitled are 'hardsubbed' with both chinese(i think)and very bad english translations(can't is spelled cann't numerous times and so on). also note the lack of any visible shaw bros. logo, shawscope logo, and beginning/ending credits. also i searched my ass off on imdb trying to find info on the titles. out of the 10, i found 4 or 5, this included title searching and cross-referencing actors and basic plot summaries. like my title says, two thumbs down."
1,This box set is a rip-off,"The movies contained are not even Shaw Brothers films, but rather films that star Shaw Brothers alumni. The video quality is awful, very poor audio/video quality, Many films are double-cropped-- they take a cropped full screen print and then crop off the top and bottom to make it look ""widescreen"", and then stretch it anamorphically, leaving you with about 25% of the original picture. This is made very annoying when you can HEAR fight scenes but not see anything, aside from a random neck/hand popping in from time to time. If you want some REAL Shaw Brothers films, you can find them for a good price on amazon. This box set is destined for the $1.99 close out bin. Please, save your money!"
1,Bleh,"The other reviews here are pretty accurate.. I was expecting it to be bad and I was still pretty dissapointed. Two other things I would like to point out is that these dvd's are inexplicably ecrypted (meaning you can play them on a dvd player but not your pc) and also that Guns of Master Killer has a rather disturbing sequence featuring a young boy stripping down to full frontal nudity, slapping gordon liu on the butt in the shower, and then crawling into a bath with him. The dialogue during this sequence is kinda creepy as well.. The rest of this set is sold individually all over the net. That disc is generally *not*.I couldn't recommend this set any less. There are only a few worth watching and even those have serious problems with the audio/video."
1,Worst Birthday Present,"I grew up watching ""Kung Fu Theater"" on TV on Saturday afternoons and loved it. I'm a big fan of good martial arts movies.A few years ago, I asked for this 10 Film Set for my birthday. Don't get fooled by the pictures or names on the cover of the box set like I did (e.g., seeing ""Master Killer"" in the film titles or the words ""Shaw"" and ""Legends"" in the 10 Film Set Title).It's horrible and is no where near the quality of the movies from my ""Kung Fu Theater"" days. When I refer to ""quality"" I am not referring to the resolution/voice dubbing. I'm not trying to compare it to high definition. The content is truly lacking.It was my mistake for not doing the research on the films listed. I just assumed I would be getting a Shaw Brothers' bargain. Please note that my friends, who also enjoy good martial arts movies, refused to sit through these movies as well. I really should toss this set but keep the set around to remind me not to make a similar mistake again."
1,Piece of crap,Stick to the legitimate Shaw Bros releases coming out of Hong Kong. Don't buy this poor-quality bootleg.
2,shaws boxset,how do you comment on a boxset that hasn't been released yet?have to rate to post so a 2 and were are the titles that are in it????
2,Why did I bother reading this?,"A book about a magical world of enchantment and possibilities? A book in which a little boy is summoned to become a great warrior hero? A book by the creators of our beloved ""Far Flung Adventures"" trilogy? Sounds great, right?First, imagine how much humor value could be packed into a simple phrase. Depends on the phrase... ""Where's the beef?"" ... ""Here's your sign"" ... ""Serenity Now!"" In Muddle Earth, the phrase is ""Shut up, Veronica!"" It is repeated on 15% of the pages of book one. This phrase becomes a symbol of the tedium and predictability of this series.There are some references to Tolkein's Middle Earth: Randalf, the wizard; Mount Boom; Elfwood with anthropomorphic trees; the Lord of the Spoons. None of this can overcome the drab plot.This book is NOT destined to become a childhood favorite."
1,A mistake,I've been trying to save space by doubling up my cd's; this product does not work; it's flimsy and doesn't stay shut effectively when cds are put in. I can't use it.
4,Convenient to have,"I just bought these so that I could carry around some data disks I needed for various projects I am working on. I like that they fit easily into the folders with the rest of my papers, and that I can put two in each container, and can still see through them to know which disk is which. Convenient product to have. Doesn't work miracles or do anything jazzy, but it definitely serves its purpose--after all its just a CD holder!!"
2,Good product but priced too high,"Delivered and shipped/received with no problems. I ordered cases from 5 suppliers to compare for future orders - avoid this product as it is priced 2-4 times too high (2$ plus substantial shipping cost per case). It IS clear, versus other versions in colors that I received at 20-40% of the cost, but the colored version were not bad.."
3,Turn the beat around: Great Disco Hits - Various Artists,"Sadly, almost every track featured is a short edited 7"" version. Only the Gladys Knight track ""It's better than a good time"" appears in its' extended 12"" version."
5,What a great addition to Settlers,"If you are a fan of Settlers of Catan, you will LOVE this version. Don't be intimidated by the instructions, when you start playing, it will be much easier. The game is a great change up to the already fun settlers. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and now all of our friends are off to buy their versions. We played all New Years Day and had a blast."
5,A great mix of...,"...passion...suspense...emotion... It's a book that seriously tugged my heartstrings and reminded me why I read romance in the first place.I never thought I could fall for a hero who rides a motorcycle -- but boy, was I wrong!"
5,Massage Lotion,This lotion gives the glide you need for deep work without the friction or leaving a heavy oily feel on skin. It also absorbs easily to the skin of clients that may be dehydrated leaving their skin moisturized. It washes from sheets easily and also has no loud scent for those sensitive to smell and when using your own Aromatherapy added to it.
4,Mixed reviews from my clients..,"This is the usual good stuff that BIOTONE provides..however, be advised that this blend has an initial cooling effect when first applied..even after warming in your hands first. Men tend to like this...Women..not so much..and 95% of my clients are Women. I am ordering something else and giving this to the female CMT's I work with.-Markkus"
5,I WISH I LIVED THERE!,"Nice DVD! It really put me in the middle of the Los Angeles action. I have been to several techno clubs down there, and this disc really covers it all quite well. Needless to say, the ""characters"" and hot girls are really enjoyable to watch as well. Additionally, the music kicks butt!"
3,Clever presentation,A broad selection of excerpts from the Analects illustrated in cartoon form. A great overview of Confucian philosophy for total novices and younger readers. Contemporary language. Pinyin romanization.
4,Love it.,"Easy to read and understand. For those who like to know more about Confucious philosophy but dont know where to start, pick this book.This book contains all the basic philosophy of the great master."
2,Looks great but not worth the money,"I got my rover Ti and within a month the bezel stopped working. It would rotate in both directions and wouldn't stay put. For a watch that costs over $400 when all is said and done that's not acceptable. Shortly after that the band broke. Don't get me wrong, this is one of the nicest looking watches for my taste available. After my experience with it though I would say its 4X the price that it should be. If I did go out on a limb to get another one it would be a stainless version with no bezel."
2,Feels Flimsy,"This is the first digital camera I got and I just wanted to get some feel of the whole digital camera thing--so I went cheap. I wasn't really surprised about the poor quality of the pictures I've been getting. But there's no excuse for some of my complaints. First off, the good things. It offered a USB transfer but my computer freezes everytime I try to use it. Second, it doesn't have a flash so you have to keep still in every shot. The software that came along with it was easy to use but it just feels too FUN.I'd say this is pretty good for grade school kids."
